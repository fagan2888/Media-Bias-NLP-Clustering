He spent much of his speech talking about getting American back on track after eight years of Barack Obama.\n\n\u201cIf we stay on the road we are on right now, we will be the first Americans that leave their children worse off than themselves,\u201d Rubio said.\n\nRubio said if elected president, he would immediately repeal the Affordable Care Act, a similar stance that Republican candidate Mitt Romney ran on in 2012.\n\nRubio also said that Obama was a failed commander in chief, adding that if he were to be elected, Rubio would take on North Korea, the self-proclaimed Islamic State, Iran and Chinese hacking attempts.\n\nRubio's speech resonated with the large crowd.\n\nLarry Freeman, who said he was undecided before the event, quickly turned into a Rubio supporter.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got a plan and I think he\u2019ll stick with it. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s just shallow promises,\u201d Freeman said. \u201cI think he\u2019ll do what he says he\u2019ll do.\u201d\n\nRubio called out Republican frontrunner Donald Trump on foreign affairs.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump says that he\u2019s not taking sides when it comes to Israel and the Palestinians. I\u2019m taking sides. When I\u2019m president, we\u2019re going to be on Israel\u2019s side,\u201d Rubio said to applause.\n\nThere were many young people in the crowd, which Rubio acknowledged, saying that\u2019s been common during his campaign.\n\nDerrick Smith, a student at Wichita State University, says supporting Rubio is pretty simple.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s younger,\u201d Smith said. \u201cObviously that sounds sort of stereotypical, but it just kind of seems like he\u2019s more in tune with our problems.\u201d\n\nSmith says that both Donald Trump and Ted Cruz are out of touch with the young vote, and that Rubio often mentions higher education reform and student loan debt.\n\nRubio told the crowd that he needs a big, come from behind victory in order to be the eventual Republican nominee. He urged each person in the audience to bring 15 more people with them to the Kansas caucuses.\n\nBoth Ted Cruz and Donald Trump plan to visit Wichita on Saturday to compete for the state\u2019s 40 delegates.\n\n--\n\nFollow Sean Sandefur on Twitter @SeanSandefur.\n\nTo contact KMUW News or to send in a news tip, reach us at news@kmuw.org.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics", "description": "Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio stopped in Wichita this afternoon to drum up support ahead of tomorrow\u2019s statewide caucuses.", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://kmuw.org/post/supporters-gather-wichita-rubio-rally-ahead-caucuses", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/kmuw/files/styles/medium/public/201603/marco_rubio.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio stopped in Wichita this afternoon to drum up support ahead of tomorrow\u2019s statewide caucuses.", "title": "Supporters Gather For Wichita Rubio Rally Ahead Of Caucuses"}, "story_id": 469265543, "twitter": {"site": "@kmuw", "card": "summary", "creator": "@SeanSandefur"}, "author": "Sean Sandefur", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Supporters Gather For Wichita Rubio Rally Ahead Of Caucuses"}, "nid": 64355, "datePublished": "2016-03-04", "keywords": "Election 2016, Marco Rubio", "wordCount": 528, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio stopped in Wichita this afternoon to drum up support ahead of tomorrow\u2019s statewide caucuses.\nBoth Ted Cruz and Donald Trump plan to visit Wichita on Saturday to compete for the state\u2019s 40 delegates.\n\u201cI think he\u2019ll do what he says he\u2019ll do.\u201dRubio called out Republican frontrunner Donald Trump on foreign affairs.\n\u201cHe\u2019s got a plan and I think he\u2019ll stick with it.\n\u201cDonald Trump says that he\u2019s not taking sides when it comes to Israel and the Palestinians."}
