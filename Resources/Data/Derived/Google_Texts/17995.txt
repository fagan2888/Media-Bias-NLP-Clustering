The Nuggets claimed guard Ian Clark off of waivers Saturday, bringing their roster up to a total of 14 players.

Clark was waived two days ago by the Utah Jazz.

The 6-foot-3, 180-pound Clark made 23 appearances for the Jazz and averaged 1.9 points in 7.0 minutes per game. He is in his second season in the NBA as an undrafted player out of Belmont University.

Clark did most of his work, however, with Utah’s D-League team, the Idaho Stampede. There, he averaged 14.0 points, 2.3 rebounds, 2.7 assists and 1.1 steals in 32.0 minutes per game.

At his best, Clark has shown the ability to be a knock-down shooter, though he didn’t get a significant opportunity to show that during his time with the Jazz. He’ll likely also be part of the Nuggets’ summer league team.
