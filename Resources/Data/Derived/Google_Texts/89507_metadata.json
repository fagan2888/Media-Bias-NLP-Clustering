The number is jarring \u2013 185, more than one per week.\n\nProPublica\u2019s risk analysis on young males killed by police certainly seems to support what has been an article of faith in the African American community for decades: Blacks are being killed at disturbing rates when set against the rest of the American population.\n\nOur examination involved detailed accounts of more than 12,000 police homicides stretching from 1980 to 2012 contained in the FBI\u2019s Supplementary Homicide Report. The data, annually self-reported by hundreds of police departments across the country, confirms some assumptions, runs counter to others, and adds nuance to a wide range of questions about the use of deadly police force.\n\nColin Loftin, University at Albany professor and co-director of the Violence Research Group, said the FBI data is a minimum count of homicides by police, and that it is impossible to precisely measure what puts people at risk of homicide by police without more and better records. Still, what the data shows about the race of victims and officers, and the circumstances of killings, are \u201ccertainly relevant,\u201d Loftin said.\n\n\u201cNo question, there are all kinds of racial disparities across our criminal justice system,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is one example.\u201d\n\nThe FBI\u2019s data has appeared in news accounts over the years, and surfaced again with the August killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. To a great degree, observers and experts lamented the limited nature of the FBI\u2019s reports. Their shortcomings are inarguable.\n\nThe data, for instance, is terribly incomplete. Vast numbers of the country\u2019s 17,000 police departments don\u2019t file fatal police shooting reports at all, and many have filed reports for some years but not others. Florida departments haven\u2019t filed reports since 1997 and New York City last reported in 2007. Information contained in the individual reports can also be flawed. Still, lots of the reporting police departments are in larger cities, and at least 1000 police departments filed a report or reports over the 33 years.\n\nThere is, then, value in what the data can show while accepting, and accounting for, its limitations. Indeed, while the absolute numbers are problematic, a comparison between white and black victims shows important trends. Our analysis included dividing the number of people of each race killed by police by the number of people of that race living in the country at the time, to produce two different rates: the risk of getting killed by police if you are white and if you are black.\n\nDavid Klinger, a University of Missouri-St. Louis professor and expert on police use of deadly force, said racial disparities in the data could result from \u201cmeasurement error,\u201d meaning that the unreported killings could alter ProPublica\u2019s findings.\n\nHowever, he said the disparity between black and white teenage boys is so wide, \u201cI doubt the measurement error would account for that.\u201d\n\nProPublica spent weeks digging into the many rich categories of information the reports hold: the race of the officers involved; the circumstances cited for the use of deadly force; the age of those killed.\n\nWho Gets Killed?\n\nThe finding that young black men are 21 times as likely as their white peers to be killed by police is drawn from reports filed for the years 2010 to 2012, the three most recent years for which FBI numbers are available.\n\n\n\n(Jonathan Stray/ProPublica)\n\nThe black boys killed can be disturbingly young. There were 41 teens 14 years or younger reported killed by police from 1980 to 2012 ii. 27 of them were black iii; 8were white iv; 4 were Hispanic v and 1 was Asian vi.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say officers weren\u2019t killing white people. Indeed, some 44 percent of all those killed by police across the 33 years were white.", "article_metadata": {"description": "New data reveal young black men are 21 times more likely to be shot by police than their white counterparts", "author": "Ryan Gabrielson, Ryann Grochowski Jones and Eric Sagara", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "New data reveal young black men are 21 times more likely to be shot by police than their white counterparts", "title": "Deadly force, in black and white", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/10/12/deadly_force_in_black_and_white_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/10/20141010-shooting-data-630x420.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "New data reveal young black men are 21 times more likely to be shot by police than their white counterparts", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/10/20141010-shooting-data-630x420.jpg", "title": "Deadly force, in black and white", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Deadly force, in black and white", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Ferguson, michael brown, police violence, ProPublica, Race", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0778\"", "article_summary": "27 of them were black iii; 8were white iv; 4 were Hispanic v and 1 was Asian vi.\nIndeed, while the absolute numbers are problematic, a comparison between white and black victims shows important trends.\nFlorida departments haven\u2019t filed reports since 1997 and New York City last reported in 2007.\nIndeed, some 44 percent of all those killed by police across the 33 years were white.\nStill, lots of the reporting police departments are in larger cities, and at least 1000 police departments filed a report or reports over the 33 years."}
