Around the room are mind-bending LED light installations that make the walls appear to undulate. Suddenly, every perceptive opening into your brain is working overtime \u2014 and the counterintuitive effect is to make you relax and enjoy it.\n\nThe Kobernick-Anchin retirement community has brought to Southwest Florida this new intervention for its memory care residents and others, based on a therapy developed in the Netherlands in the 1970s for children with disabilities. The multisensory room, which officially opened on Monday, is designed to soothe anxieties and lift depression for elders whose mind-body connections can benefit from its gentle forms of stimulation.\n\nKobernick-Anchin-Benderson was established in 1993 by the Sarasota Manatee Jewish Housing Council as a not-for-profit campus of elder living options ranging from independent apartments to memory care. Like other continuing-care retirement communities across the nation, it faces the challenge of more residents being afflicted by dementia as they live into their late 80s and beyond.\n\nSome 5 million people in the U.S. are estimated to have Alzheimer\u2019s disease, the most common form of dementia, and the number is expected to more than double by 2050. Cures and prevention remain elusive goals, but as more is learned about what parts of the brain are most impaired, behavioral therapies are developing that can help improve quality of life and slow the disease\u2019s progression.\n\nIn March, Kobernick-Anchin opened a 1950s-style kitchen in its memory unit, which helps residents connect to long-term memories of starting adult life in the post-World War II era.\n\nPHOTO GALLERY: Click here to see more images\n\nThis new and even more elaborate installation, supported by grants, has been a goal for community CEO Darlene Arbeit, and came together after two years of research, says April Moschini, activity director at the Anchin Pavilion. The plan is to study the therapies\u2019 effects on residents with cognitive or emotional issues, eventually expanding their benefit to all residents and even to the public.\n\nThe interactive environment of experiences and playthings that make all five senses work together is known as Snoezelen (SNOO-zelen) therapy, from the blending of two Dutch words that mean \u201crelax\u201d and \u201cexplore.\u201d In this country, the technique is most often used for children with autism. But experiments with older adults \u2014 especially those with some form of dementia \u2014 are beginning to spread to the United States from Europe.\n\nEach Kobernick-Anchin resident who uses the room with a therapist will receive an individualized \u201csensory diet\u201d based on clinical needs and personal desires, explains Elyse Gordon, director of rehab.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHow you might feel on a roller coaster is very different from what I might feel,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd to you, the smell of lavender may be noxious, or calming and soothing.\u201d\n\nSome people may prefer the scent of cedar to lavender, or a free-floating swing to a cozy recliner with massage pillows. Or they might respond best to a single stimulation, like a darkened room with a starry night sky projected on the ceiling while crickets chirp from the sound system.\n\n\u201cThe beauty of this room is that it\u2019s all-inclusive, and there\u2019s thought behind each thing placed in here,\u201d Gordon says, holding in both hands a glowing plastic egg that changes colors. For elders who no longer perform routine tasks like washing dishes, she says, the natural ability to use two hands in concert can fade over time.\n\n\u201cWith this egg, just being able to use both hands together, it\u2019s crossing the midline in your brain and causing the pathways to regenerate,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing that something like this makes you want to hold it with both hands, and neurologically that\u2019s a good thing.\u201d\n\nAlthough the Snoezelen paraphernalia \u2014 from bubble lights to glowing fiberoptic strands \u2014 are based on proven sensory therapies, \u201cwhen it comes to dementia care, it\u2019s really new and cutting-edge,\u201d says Moschini. \u201cWe would like to collect data so we can report on what works for us.\u201d\n\nIt is not known how many elder communities or nursing homes have installed multisensory rooms in the United States, but one chain \u2014 ACTS Retirement-Life Communities, is adding the therapy to more campuses after commissioning a study at its location in Southampton, Pa.\n\nRochelle Robbins, dean of the school of arts and sciences at Holy Family University, helped conduct the study, based on the home\u2019s regular 90-day assessments for agitation and depression. Fourteen out of 15 subjects selected for the study showed measurable improvements in mood and social interaction over the three-month period, the researchers reported in the journal Long-Term Living.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of research out there about helping dementia patients,\u201d says Robbins, a psychologist. \u201cIn my field, especially, they don\u2019t want to touch it; it\u2019s a hot potato. But here, we\u2019re not talking about fixing dementia; we\u2019re talking about quality of life.\u201d\n\nRobbins was struck by the way certain images \u2014 like tropical fish swimming across the wall \u2014 could evoke memories in patients who rarely spoke outside the room. One woman, she said, would braid and unbraid the strands of fiberoptic cable, talking as she worked.\n\n\u201cDepression scores went down, and we found these residents needed fewer medications,\u201d Robbins said. \u201cWe also found it wasn\u2019t for everybody. There were some people who refused to even walk in there.\u201d\n\nIn pre-testing the room at Kobernick-Anchin, Moschini and Gordon have seen similar results.\n\n\u201cWe have a resident in our memory support unit who calls out a great deal,\u201d says Moschini. \u201cWe were able to bring her in here, and she gravitated toward this projection on the wall \u2014 it was an ocean scene or a waterfall. For the whole time she was here, there was no calling out. This occupied her brain enough that she didn\u2019t feel the need.\u201d\n\nGordon says images in the room can evoke pleasant memories \u2014 of holidays or beach vacations, say \u2014 and evoke conversation in people who have become withdrawn. And, as with the woman entranced by the nature scene, just being able to pay attention helps orient a person who has daily difficulty finding a place in the world.\n\n\u201cI believe she calls out because she wants to make sure that there are people or things around her,\u201d Gordon says. \u201cWhen she saw all this, she was at peace with everything.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2013/11/mainSSENSORY.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "article_summary": "There were some people who refused to even walk in there.\u201dIn pre-testing the room at Kobernick-Anchin, Moschini and Gordon have seen similar results.\nThe Kobernick-Anchin retirement community has brought to Southwest Florida this new intervention for its memory care residents and others, based on a therapy developed in the Netherlands in the 1970s for children with disabilities.\nThe interactive environment of experiences and playthings that make all five senses work together is known as Snoezelen (SNOO-zelen) therapy, from the blending of two Dutch words that mean \u201crelax\u201d and \u201cexplore.\u201d In this country, the technique is most often used for children with autism.\nSuddenly, every perceptive opening into your brain is working overtime \u2014 and the counterintuitive effect is to make you relax and enjoy it.\n\u201cI believe she calls out because she wants to make sure that there are people or things around her,\u201d Gordon says."}
