We know it helps us see the world around us in better detail, but just how exactly? In Mental Floss\u2019s video, \u201cWhy do you see better when you squint?,\u201d host Craig Benzine explains squinting improves our eyesight by changing the shape of the eye and limiting the amount of excess light that enters it.\n\n\u201cThe whole reason we can see is thanks to our good friend light. While you\u2019re looking at something, light is entering the pupil,\u201d says Benzine. \u201cThe lens in your eye lives right behind the pupil and that focuses the light on the retina.\u201d\n\nThe retina contains photosensitive cells known as rods (vision in low light) and cones (color vision) that create the image of what we see. Once the light reaches the retina, it encounters a chemical called rhodopsin, which converts light into an electrical impulse that the brain processes as vision. It is within the retina that the fovea \u2014 a small, central pit made of packed cones \u2014 helps maintain our sharp and central vision.\n\nOur ability to focus on light properly does deteriorate with age, which means that some objects may appear blurry. The amount of light that enters the eye can also propose a problem as it arrives from different angles and must be focused together. This is why some of us squint to overcome blurry vision.\n\nThe act of squinting is able to help us see better is two ways. First, it changes the shape of the eye so that the light coming into the eye can be focused directly on fovea, helping us see more clearly the amount of light entering the eye. Second, squinting inhibits unnecessary excess light from entering the eye to make it easier for the eye to focus on less all at once.\n\nNow, squinting in order to focus can also be a sign of poor eyesight and requires a visit to the optometrist. Occasionally squinting won\u2019t permanently damage sight, but it can lead to headaches because it involves the contraction of the facial muscles.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "eye, health, squinting, corrects, blurry, vision, changing, eye, shape, limiting, light", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Squinting helps overcome blurriness by changing the eye shape and the amount of light entering the eye.", "title": "Why Squinting Helps You See Clearer [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/eye-health-squinting-corrects-blurry-vision-changing-eye-shape-limiting-light-335178", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/05/27/eye-health-squinting-corrects-blurry-vision-changing-eye-shape-limiting-light.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Squinting helps overcome blurriness by changing the eye shape and the amount of light entering the eye.", "title": "Why Squinting Helps You See Clearer [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/eye-health-squinting-corrects-blurry-vision-changing-eye-shape-limiting-light-335178", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/05/27/eye-health-squinting-corrects-blurry-vision-changing-eye-shape-limiting-light.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/05/27/eye-health-squinting-corrects-blurry-vision-changing-eye-shape-limiting-light.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Vitality", "published_time": "2015-05-27T13:38:58-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-27T13:38:56-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Squinting helps overcome blurriness by changing the eye shape and the amount of light entering the eye."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1a5c\"", "article_summary": "First, it changes the shape of the eye so that the light coming into the eye can be focused directly on fovea, helping us see more clearly the amount of light entering the eye.\nSecond, squinting inhibits unnecessary excess light from entering the eye to make it easier for the eye to focus on less all at once.\nOur ability to focus on light properly does deteriorate with age, which means that some objects may appear blurry.\nIn Mental Floss\u2019s video, \u201cWhy do you see better when you squint?,\u201d host Craig Benzine explains squinting improves our eyesight by changing the shape of the eye and limiting the amount of excess light that enters it.\nOnce the light reaches the retina, it encounters a chemical called rhodopsin, which converts light into an electrical impulse that the brain processes as vision."}
