Still, it\u2019s a mess, a failed comedy that\u2019s both frantic and leaden, and largely laughless. As a vehicle for Johnny Depp, coming off five years of duds like The Tourist, The Rum Diary, Dark Shadows, and The Lone Ranger, it\u2019s another dire misstep along the path of facile muggery and simpering self-regard.\n\nThe movie is based on a \u201970s cult novel by the late English writer Kyril Bonfiglioli, whose specialty was an updated take on the fusty brilliance of P.G. Wodehouse. Bonfiglioli\u2019s protagonist, Charlie Mortdecai (Depp\u2019s role here) is a dissolute British aristocrat whose fortune is running out. He\u2019s down to his last country estate and vintage Rolls, his marriage to the svelte Johanna (Gwyneth Paltrow) is collapsing, and he\u2019s compelled to take part in shady art dealings to make ends meet. When a priceless Goya goes missing, an MI5 officer named Alistair Martland (Ewan McGregor) calls him in to track it down. Accompanied by his faithful manservant\u2014whose name, I\u2019m afraid, is Jock Strapp (Paul Bettany)\u2014Mortdecai soon finds himself pinballing from Oxford to Moscow to palmy Los Angeles in the revolving company of an art-smuggling auto mechanic (Paul Whitehouse), a demented revolutionary (Jonny Pasvolsky), and a wily nymphomaniac (Olivia Munn) and her billionaire father (Jeff Goldblum). There are also some mad Russians, a jowly toff described as \u201cthe rudest man in England,\u201d and a long-dormant Swiss bank account established by the Nazi art thief Hermann G\u00f6ring.\n\nThe tone being striven for here is antic farce\u2014something along the lines of mid-period Blake Edwards, possibly. Director David Koepp has failed to achieve it, though. Koepp, who wrote the unfortunate Indiana Jones fiasco Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, opens this movie with a scene involving Chinese mobsters in a Hong Kong nightclub that\u2019s lifted for no particular reason from the Shanghai opening of Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. He then spends the rest of the film trying to maintain our interest in the story\u2019s endless idiocy, which involves, among many other things, incessant banter about Mortdecai\u2019s silly mustache, which might have been ripped straight off the lip of Hercule Poirot. There\u2019s also dialogue that would defeat the most determined performer. Mortdecai observes that \u201ckissing a man without a mustache is like eating an egg without salt.\u201d Reminded of his enormous back-tax bill, he says, \u201cI had no idea I was so deep in Her Majesty\u2019s hole.\u201d When he turns up smashed in one scene, Martland hisses, \u201cYou\u2019re as drunk as a fiddler\u2019s bitch.\u201d\n\nThe movie has a swank production design, and some of the actors, especially Bettany, manage to rise to the low occasion. But Depp\u2014one of the film\u2019s producers\u2014is a sad sight, negotiating the movie\u2019s witless hubbub with a veddy-veddy English accent and a repertoire of inane facial tics that borders on vaudevillian. Unfortunately, this sort of self-indulgent miscalculation is nothing new in his latter-day career. But the man is such an inherently likable performer that we still hope he\u2019ll come to his senses, preferably soon. His vast reservoir of audience goodwill might be nearing depletion.\n\nBlack Sea\n\nKevin Macdonald\u2019s Black Sea is overloaded with narrative cargo. There\u2019s a sunken treasure (Nazi gold, the best kind), a cramped submarine in search of it (lots of squinty tension and infernal lighting), and an ornery crew (half Brits, half Russians, all at each other\u2019s throats). But there\u2019s also a tearful love story\u2014sketched in gauzy flashbacks\u2014and some awkwardly overlaid working-class economic resentments that might have been airlifted in from another kind of picture. These elements don\u2019t mesh as smoothly as you might hope, but the movie does offer some familiar claustrophobic pleasures, along with unexpected echoes of films like The Treasure of the Sierra Madre and even Aliens (there\u2019s a scheming corporate weasel onboard). The movie\u2019s often fun, but mostly just kinda.\n\nJude Law is convincingly crusty as a submarine pilot named Robinson, who has spent most of his life working in marine salvage. When the company by which he\u2019s employed abruptly lays him off, he curses the fat cats who run the world and have ruined the economy, and pines for his ex-wife, who left him to marry\u2014what else?\u2014some rich guy. Huddling in a pub with other jobless seamen, Robinson hears tell of a Nazi submarine that went down in the Black Sea back in the 1940s, bearing a payload of Reichsmarks now worth many millions of dollars. A wealthy American agrees to finance an expedition to retrieve this treasure from under the Russian fleet patrolling above it; in return, this mysterious moneyman wants a big slice of the action, and insists on sending along his landlubbing assistant, Daniels (Scoot McNairy). Robinson and his Russian pal Blackie (Konstantin Khabensky) assemble a crew, refurbish a rust-bucket sub, and are soon underway.\n\nMacdonald, who also directed The Last King of Scotland and the newshound thriller State of Play, effectively cranks up suspense as the crew members, divided by linguistic comprehension, start butting heads, and the usual mechanical disasters proliferate. He also renders the digital depths through which the submarine passes with evocative eeriness, and in one long underwater sequence delivers some top-drawer thrills.\n\nUnfortunately, while Ben Mendelsohn is a memorable wacko, there are too many other shipmates onboard to command full individual attention (and the most appealing of them disappears early on). The occasional spasms of violence are also problematic, motivated by nothing more than screenwriter Dennis Kelly\u2019s insistence that they transpire. And we can\u2019t help wondering, throughout, exactly how Robinson would expect to shift a large pile of gold bars off his ship without anyone casting covetous eyes upon them.\n\nThis is nitpicking, of course. No one expects a genre movie to completely add up. But Black Sea would have benefited from a tighter script. Even the twisty ending doesn\u2019t really pull the movie together.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Johnny Depp\u2019s sad career slide continues, Jude Law goes for the gold.", "title": "Mortdecai and Black Sea", "url": "http://reason.com/archives/2015/01/23/mortdecai-and-black-sea", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14220213431308.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Rather\ndisappointingly, Mortdecai isn\u2019t the flaming catastrophe\nthat its dreadful trailer seems to promise.
