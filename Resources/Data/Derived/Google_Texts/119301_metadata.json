The project contractor, Great Lakes Dredge and Dock Co., will run the rock-picking machine at the beach for another two weeks, said Brian Williams, chief of the program and civil works management branch for the Corps Charleston District.\n\n\u201cWe really don\u2019t have the contract vehicle to keep Great Lakes out there indefinitely,\u201d Williams said.\n\nOn Thursday, the machinery was idled near the pier next to a pile of sand and rocks. The machine digs sand and sifts out rocks that look like fossils, said Mayor Tim Goodwin.\n\nRock-like material mixed with the sand is a problem for the length of the renourishment completed last year. The city hopes to identify another, cleaner source of sand for its next beach restoration project, Goodwin said.\n\nThe rocky materials have shown up on the beach at the county park on the south end of the island. Sand in the ocean typically flows in that direction which could mean the rocks are from the city beach, said Tom O\u2019Rourke, executive director of the Charleston County Parks and Recreation Commission.\n\n\u201cI think all of the (beach) stones on the entire island are the result of the city renourishment,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said.\n\nThe stones are \u201cnot a showstopper,\u201d he said.\n\nOn Thursday, most of the rocks at the park beach were located past the high-tide line.\n\n\u201cI think it takes away from the beauty of the beach. You have to be a little more careful about where you are stepping. I was wondering if it was asphalt,\u201d said Janice Hart of Boston.\n\nThe park commission completed a separate beach-restoration project that drew from the Stono River Inlet. The park beach had clean sand when that work was finished, O\u2019Rourke said.\n\nThe county park has been named one of the nation\u2019s \u201cBest Restored Beaches\u201d by the American Shore and Beach Preservation Association, an advocate for renourishment projects and other beach planning. It joins beaches in Port St. Lucie, Fla., Galveston, Texas and Santa Monica, Calif.\n\nThe PRC in 2013 dealt with environmental concerns and diverted $3 million from other funds to shore up the severely eroded and closed park when the mandated and overdue Folly renourishment was not funded because of federal budget crimps and divisive politics. The overall beach renourishment finally took place in 2014.\n\n\u201cThe loss of the county park access was a loss to the whole community, said Lee Weishar, who chaired the committee that chose the best restored beaches. \u201cThis project gave them back their recreational beach and had the added benefit of adding sea turtle and pelican habitat.\u201d\n\nBefore the city beach renourishment began, sample borings of the ocean site where sand was dug showed that it was good-quality material.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately it wasn\u2019t as clean as we thought,\u201d said Glenn Jeffries, Corps spokesman.\n\nA decision to move forward with digging a new area of the ocean bottom to supply sand for the city beach renourishment was an \u201ceducated guess\u201d based on available information obtained through a number of sample borings.\n\nMore extensive sampling would have added millions of dollars to the cost of the project, she said.\n\nThe federal government paid 85 percent of the renourishment cost and the city the rest.\n\nReach Bo Petersen at 937-5744, @bopete on twitter or Bo Petersen Reporting on Facebook.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Rocky beach at county park result of Folly renourishment, officials say, FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsMetro, \r\nMetro, Charleston County parks,Folly Beach,renourishment of beach,Tim Goodwin,Tom O'Rourke", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "FOLLY BEACH \u2014 A rock- picking machine has been at work sifting out clumps of hard material mixed-in with the sand pumped from offshore for the city\u2019s $30 million beach nourishment project.", "title": "Rocky beach at county park result of Folly renourishment, officials say", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20150521/150529843/rocky-beach-at-county-park-result-of-folly-renourishment-officials-say", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150521/PC16/150529843/AR/0/AR-150529843.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150521/PC16/150529843/AR/0/AR-150529843.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "FOLLY BEACH \u2014 A rock- picking machine has been at work sifting out clumps of hard material mixed-in with the sand pumped from offshore for the city\u2019s $30 million beach nourishment project.", "title": "Rocky beach at county park result of Folly renourishment, officials say", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@postandcourier", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150521/PC16/150529843/AR/0/AR-150529843.jpg?201505211918", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 150529843}}, "keywords": "Rocky beach at county park result of Folly renourishment, officials say , FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsMetro, \r\nMetro, Charleston County parks,Folly Beach,renourishment of beach,Tim Goodwin,Tom O'Rourke", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-21T18:32:30Z", "modified_time": "2015-05-21T19:18:00Z", "author": "Bo Petersen\r\nPrentiss Findlay"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "FOLLY BEACH \u2014 A rock- picking machine has been at work sifting out clumps of hard material mixed-in with the sand pumped from offshore for the city\u2019s $30 million beach nourishment project."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9163\"", "article_summary": "Rock-like material from the Folly Beach renourishment project litters the beach near the county park.\nThe rocky materials have shown up on the beach at the county park on the south end of the island.\n\u201cI think all of the (beach) stones on the entire island are the result of the city renourishment,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said.\nOn Thursday, most of the rocks at the park beach were located past the high-tide line.\n\u201cThe loss of the county park access was a loss to the whole community, said Lee Weishar, who chaired the committee that chose the best restored beaches."}
