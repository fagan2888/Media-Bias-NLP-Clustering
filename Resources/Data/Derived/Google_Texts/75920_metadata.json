Panelists include Robert Powell, senior columnist and editor of Retirement Weekly from MarketWatch; Knut Rostad, president and founder of the Institute for the Fiduciary Standard; Ira Hammerman, executive vice president and general counsel for the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association; and Brad Campbell, attorney and former Assistant Secretary of Labor for Employee Benefits and head of the Employee Benefits Security Administration.\n\nThe evening begins with cocktails at 6:30 p.m., followed by our panel discussion and a question-and-answer period.
