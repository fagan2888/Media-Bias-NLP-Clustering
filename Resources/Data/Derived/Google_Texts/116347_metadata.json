Just seeing Moby packed like that, they\u2019re the reason we won this game. They were behind us 110 percent. It was incredible.\u201d\n\nShe added of her match, \u201cI think it\u2019s just something that flowed tonight. I just kind of went out there and was pretty relaxed and played with freedom, and I knew we had nothing to lose so I might as well just take some cracks at the ball and see what happens. And good things happened.\u201d\n\nCSU coach Tom Hilbert called it a \u201cfantastic match in front of an unbelievable crowd in a great venue. This is what college sports is supposed to be like. I am glad we are able to take the sport of volleyball and put it in that arena (with) that type of event. It was amazing. \u2026 This has been the happiest and greatest match I have been a part of in 18 years here at CSU. It was a big moment for CSU, volleyball, and the state of Colorado.\u201d\n\nCU coach Liz Kritza said of the Buffs\u2019 comeback: \u201cThey are winners, they have guts, and steel in their spine. They simply refused to just let it go. We didn\u2019t play our best volleyball today, and we are honest with each other and we didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nThe appearance in the Sweet 16 will be the 10th for the Rams, and they\u2019ll meet Texas on Friday.\n\nTerry Frei: tfrei@denverpost.com or @TFrei", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Colorado State,Marlee Reynolds,Tom Hilbert,Volleyball", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "The Field House", "description": "The Colorado State volleyball team is headed to the NCAA Sweet 16 after defeating Colorado in five sets on Saturday, Dec. 6, 2014, at Moby Arena.", "title": "Colorado State volleyball advances to Sweet 16", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/colleges/2014/12/07/sweet-16-colorado-state-volleyball/32892/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/colleges/files/2014/12/csu-volleyball-sweet-16.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "The Colorado State volleyball team is headed to the NCAA Sweet 16 after defeating Colorado in five sets on Saturday, Dec. 6, 2014, at Moby Arena.", "title": "Colorado State volleyball advances to Sweet 16 after beating Colorado", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/colleges/2014/12/07/sweet-16-colorado-state-volleyball/32892/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/colleges/files/2014/12/csu-volleyball-sweet-16.jpg", "creator": "@TFrei", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "language": "en, sv", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "The Colorado State volleyball team is headed to the NCAA Sweet 16 after defeating Colorado in five sets on Saturday, Dec. 6, 2014, at Moby Arena."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd04a\"", "article_summary": "After beating Colorado in five sets Saturday to win the four-team NCAA sub-regional at Moby Arena, the Colorado State Rams are in the sweet 16 and headed to Minneapolis for next weekend\u2019s regional.\nIt was a big moment for CSU, volleyball, and the state of Colorado.\u201dCU coach Liz Kritza said of the Buffs\u2019 comeback: \u201cThey are winners, they have guts, and steel in their spine.\nWe didn\u2019t play our best volleyball today, and we are honest with each other and we didn\u2019t.\u201dThe appearance in the Sweet 16 will be the 10th for the Rams, and they\u2019ll meet Texas on Friday.\nI am glad we are able to take the sport of volleyball and put it in that arena (with) that type of event.\n\u2026 This has been the happiest and greatest match I have been a part of in 18 years here at CSU."}
