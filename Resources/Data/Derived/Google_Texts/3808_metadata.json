A lack of breastfeeding mothers might be a contributing factor.\n\nIt might have meant well, but a Mexican breastfeeding campaign is under fire after releasing posters that offended some health advocates. The campaign is part of a new health initiative encouraging new mothers to breastfeed.\n\nCelebrities posed topless with a sign across their breast that read: \u201cNo les des la espalda, dale pecho,\u201d which translates to: \u201cDon\u2019t turn you back on them, give them your breast.\u201d Critics say these posters sexualize breastfeeding and stigmatize women who don\u2019t breastfeed, rather than encourage them.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization, only 14 percent of Mexican women breastfeed their children for the first six months. That\u2019s one of the lowest rates in Latin America. This might account for the fact that Mexico is the most obese country in the world because studies show that breastfeeding can help lower childhood obesity and breast cancer.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not only a very terrible campaign in terms of how it looks, but it\u2019s also the message that if you don\u2019t breast-feed, you are a bad mother and you are the one to blame,\u201d said Regina Tames, of the reproductive rights group GIRE, NPR reported.\n\nTames says that there are many other reasons why women in Mexico don\u2019t or can\u2019t breastfeed. Some reasons are poverty, poor nutrition, and the fact that women are now working longer hours. Also, pumping milk is not encouraged and is oftentimes not allowed.\n\nThe ads \"condemn mothers, rather than informing them about breastfeeding, and they reduce a social problem with multiple players \u2014 fathers as well as mothers, workplaces, health authorities, and public spaces and the community at large \u2014 to one person: the mother,\" a group of activists wrote in a complaint to the city's human rights commission, the Associated Press reported.\n\nMexico City health official launched a new campaign in May to boost image of nursing mothers http://t.co/23808XzKl9 pic.twitter.com/dOvyip7y9F \u00e2\u20ac\u201d ASH: Fredric Wertham (@fredric_wertham) May 26, 2014\n\nThe campaign also excluded the reality of how mothers look when they give birth. The \u201cnew mothers,\u201d portrayed by celebrities, show actress Camila Sodi, actress Maribel Guardia, and boxer Mariana \u201cLa Barby\u201d Ju\u00e1rez with toned midsections.\n\n\"I don't know what these mothers reflect, or who they were supposed to attract,\" Tames said.\n\nBreastfeeding initiatives and campaigns have been a part of health initiatives all over the world. In recent years, the U.S. has signed certain laws that encourage breastfeeding, such as the \"Break Time for Nursing Mothers\" law. In the United Kingdom, the Equality Act 2010 clearly states that businesses must not discriminate against a woman breastfeeding a child at any age.\n\nDespite these laws, in the U.S., many women are shamed into going into bathrooms to breastfeed. This stigma was also portrayed by a college advertising project called, \u201cWhen Nuture Calls.\u201d The photos showed women in cramped, dirty bathrooms trying to feed their babies.\n\nDespite these setbacks, issues such as this one raise awareness on the breastfeeding taboo and incite healthy conversations about the topic.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "breastfeeding, mexico breastfeeding campaign", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A Mexican breastfeeding campaign faces criticism after a poster promoting breastfeeding features celebrities and doesn't portray \"real mothers.\"", "title": "Mexico Breastfeeding Campaign Upsets With Sexual Images", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/mexico-breastfeeding-campaign-sexualizes-act-and-misrepresents-mothers-upsetting-health-advocates", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/05/27/shutterstock136597052.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A Mexican breastfeeding campaign faces criticism after a poster promoting breastfeeding features celebrities and doesn't portray \"real mothers.\"", "title": "Mexico Breastfeeding Campaign Upsets With Sexual Images", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/mexico-breastfeeding-campaign-sexualizes-act-and-misrepresents-mothers-upsetting-health-advocates", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/05/27/shutterstock136597052.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/05/27/shutterstock136597052.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-05-27T15:27:47-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-05-27T15:27:46-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A Mexican breastfeeding campaign faces criticism after a poster promoting breastfeeding features celebrities and doesn't portray \"real mothers.\""}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7ebb\"", "article_summary": "It might have meant well, but a Mexican breastfeeding campaign is under fire after releasing posters that offended some health advocates.\nAccording to the World Health Organization, only 14 percent of Mexican women breastfeed their children for the first six months.\nA lack of breastfeeding mothers might be a contributing factor.\nThe campaign is part of a new health initiative encouraging new mothers to breastfeed.\nTames says that there are many other reasons why women in Mexico don\u2019t or can\u2019t breastfeed."}
