By 2025, it foresees a shortage of between 46,000 and 90,000 physicians, with specialists being the hardest to come by. The problem is basic supply and demand. A growing population, with a large aging segment, is growing faster than the minting of new doctors. The expected result will be a shortfall.\n\nThe study determined that size of shortage after looking at projections for service demand, demographic changes and alterations in payment mechanisms and processes. The quick summation is that demand will outstrip supply.\n\nEven though the number of physicians will \"modestly\" increase by anywhere from 4 percent to 12 percent, the difference in actual physician availability depends on future retirements and number of hours doctors work.\n\nThe growth in physicians won't keep up with increased need, which could rise by between 11 percent and 17 percent. That includes Census Bureau revised projections of a U.S. population of 347.3 million by 2025.\n\nThe shortfall in primary care physicians could run between 12,500 and 31,100. For nonprimary care physicians (specialists), the shortfall will run between 28,200 and 63,700.\n\nAlthough the ACA is expected to increase demand for physicians because more people will have access to health insurance, those patients represent only a 2 percent increase of demand over supply.\n\nTo reduce shortfalls to the lower ends of the ranges, the health care system will need multiple strategies to offset the lack of doctors. Among those are improved technology and greater dependence on physician assistants as nurse practitioners, certified nurse midwives and nurse anesthetists.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A sobering new study sees a shortage of between 46,000 and 90,000 physicians by 2025 -- and good luck finding a specialist", "og": {"url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/too-many-patients-not-enough-doctors/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/07/02/ab30f2a4-3f84-4144-8368-ce0feb6e10fb/thumbnail/1200x630/b7089e568d7d2eecc2aab461a826fc49/doctor2.jpg", "height": 630}, "type": "article", "description": "A sobering new study sees a shortage of between 46,000 and 90,000 physicians by 2025 -- and good luck finding a specialist", "title": "Too many patients, not enough doctors"}, "twitter": {"description": "A sobering new study sees a shortage of between 46,000 and 90,000 physicians by 2025 -- and good luck finding a specialist", "title": "Too many patients, not enough doctors", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "cbsnewsapp://news/too-many-patients-not-enough-doctors/", "iphone": "cbsnewsapp://news/too-many-patients-not-enough-doctors/", "googleplay": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/too-many-patients-not-enough-doctors/"}, "country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "CBS News", "iphone": "CBS News", "googleplay": "CBS News"}, "id": {"ipad": 334256223, "iphone": 334256223, "googleplay": "com.treemolabs.apps.cbsnews"}}, "creator": "@http://twitter.com/ErikSherman", "site": "@CBSNews", "image": "http://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/07/02/ab30f2a4-3f84-4144-8368-ce0feb6e10fb/thumbnail/1200x630/b7089e568d7d2eecc2aab461a826fc49/doctor2.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"web": {"url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/too-many-patients-not-enough-doctors/"}, "android": {"app_name": "CBS News", "package": "com.treemolabs.apps.cbsnews"}, "ios": {"url": "cbsnewsapp://news/too-many-patients-not-enough-doctors/", "app_name": "CBS News", "app_store_id": 334256223}}, "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"app_id": 1536620209892267}, "keywords": "affordable care act, doctors , doctor shortage, physician, health care system, health care", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CBSMoneyWatch", "author": 144902862225625}, "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "affordable care act, doctors , doctor shortage, physician, health care system, health care"}, "article_summary": "To reduce shortfalls to the lower ends of the ranges, the health care system will need multiple strategies to offset the lack of doctors.\nAlthough the ACA is expected to increase demand for physicians because more people will have access to health insurance, those patients represent only a 2 percent increase of demand over supply.\nA growing population, with a large aging segment, is growing faster than the minting of new doctors.\nFor nonprimary care physicians (specialists), the shortfall will run between 28,200 and 63,700.\nThe shortfall in primary care physicians could run between 12,500 and 31,100."}
