(REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst)\n\n4458690\n\nThe Supreme Court will hear the top court threat to Obamacare in years next month, but the head of the Department of Health and Human Services still won\u2019t say whether the Obama administration is even making a back-up plan in the event it loses the case.\n\nUpon repeated questioning from the Senate Finance Committee about HHS\u2019 preparations for the possibility that the Supreme Court rules in King v. Burwell that Obamacare subsidies are restricted to state exchanges alone, HHS secretary Sylvia Burwell repeatedly dodged the question.\n\n\u201cRight now, my focus is on completing and implementing the law, which we believe is the law,\u201d Burwell said at a Wednesday Senate Finance Committee hearing. \u201cRight now, what we\u2019re focused on is the open enrollment.\u201d\n\nSen. John Cornyn pressed Burwell on Wednesday about whether HHS has made any moves to inform customers that they may lose their subsidies come June, when the Court issues its decisions, and questioned whether HHS has come up with a plan for how to proceed if the case doesn\u2019t go their way. Burwell repeated the mantra that the agency is working on open enrollment but refused to answer.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a highly intelligent, charming person, but you\u2019ve refused to answer our questions, and that, to me, that doesn\u2019t strike me as trying to work with Congress but rather [as] contemptuous of Congress\u2019s oversight responsibilities,\u201d Cornyn charged.\n\nObamacare\u2019s second open enrollment period ends Feb. 15, with HHS in crunch time to get as many sign-ups as possible. But Burwell has been refusing to address the looming Supreme Court case for months. HHS also opted not to inform Obamacare customers, all while touting open enrollment, that their premiums may skyrocket come June if the Court rules subsidies illegal in federal exchanges \u2014 a majority of the country.\n\nA decision against the administration will create a huge problem for the health-care law. With 87 percent of federal exchange customers receiving subsidies, the law only makes health coverage affordable with taxpayer subsidies and millions may drop their insurance if the King plaintiffs are successful.\n\nThe administration is keeping mum on the problem for a reason, according to Cato Institute health policy director Michael Cannon, whose work first brought to light the plaintiffs\u2019 argument in King and other cases.\n\n\u201cThe effect is to prevent healthcare.gov enrollees from learning about the risks to their coverage,\u201d Cannon said of Burwell\u2019s showing at Wednesday\u2019s hearing. \u201cThey are deliberately deceiving consumers about those risks.\u201d\n\nStaying quiet on the potential for loss of subsidies can only help the administration\u2019s enrollment effort\u2019s today, regardless of the consequences for consumers later on.\n\n\u201cThis is deliberate\u2026Tyrannis delenda est,\u201d Cannon concluded.\n\nFor now, consumers will have to stay in the dark about what will happen if the Supreme Court decides Obamacare gives subsidies only to states. Cornyn tried to get an idea about Burwell\u2019s plans to keep the health care law alive in the event that the administration loses its case, but to little avail.\n\nAfter refusing to say whether she plans to ask Congress to pass a law extending Obamacare subsidies to federal exchanges, Burwell also dodged Cornyn\u2019s questioning on whether the secretary hopes to issue an \u201cadministrative fix\u201d to get around a Court decision.\n\n\u201cWhat I have focused on is, right now, the current implementation of the law,\u201d Burwell said.\n\n\u201cIt seems to me that this administration continues to parade witnesses in front of committees like this one and to deny us a straightforward answer to straightforward questions, and that\u2019s just unacceptable,\u201d Cornyn concluded.\n\nWATCH:\n\nFollow Sarah on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Sarah Hurtubise", "description": "'Contemptuous of Congress's oversight responsibilities'", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "The Supreme Court will hear the top court threat to Obamacare in years next month, but the head of the Department of Health and Human Services still won't say whether the Obama administration is even", "title": "John Cornyn Berates HHS Chief For Dodging Questions On Obamacare Subsidies Case [VIDEO]", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2015/02/04/john-cornyn-berates-hhs-chief-for-dodging-questions-on-obamacare-subsidies-case-video/", "image": {"width": 630, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/2014-05-12T141143Z_1_LYNXMPEA4B0EK_RTROPTP_4_USA-HEALTHCARE-BURWELL-e1400101654762.jpg", "height": 269}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "'Contemptuous of Congress's oversight responsibilities'", "title": "John Cornyn Berates HHS Chief For Dodging Questions On Obamacare Subsidies Case [VIDEO] Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2015/02/04/john-cornyn-berates-hhs-chief-for-dodging-questions-on-obamacare-subsidies-case-video/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/2014-05-12T141143Z_1_LYNXMPEA4B0EK_RTROPTP_4_USA-HEALTHCARE-BURWELL-e1400101654762.jpg"}, "creator": "@@SarahMHurtubise", "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-02-04 18:34:18", "sailthru.title": "John Cornyn Berates HHS Chief For Dodging Questions On Obamacare Subsidies Case [VIDEO]", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "sailthru.tags": "john-cornyn,king-v-burwell,obamacare,sylvia-burwell,sarah-hurtubise", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "keywords": "john cornyn,king v. burwell,obamacare,sylvia burwell", "sailthru.description": "The Supreme Court will hear the top court threat to Obamacare in years next month, but the head of the Department of Health and Human Services still won't say whether the Obama administration is even", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/2014-05-12T141143Z_1_LYNXMPEA4B0EK_RTROPTP_4_USA-HEALTHCARE-BURWELL-e1400101654762.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3876\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWhat I have focused on is, right now, the current implementation of the law,\u201d Burwell said.\n\u201cRight now, my focus is on completing and implementing the law, which we believe is the law,\u201d Burwell said at a Wednesday Senate Finance Committee hearing.\nFor now, consumers will have to stay in the dark about what will happen if the Supreme Court decides Obamacare gives subsidies only to states.\nBut Burwell has been refusing to address the looming Supreme Court case for months.\nUpon repeated questioning from the Senate Finance Committee about HHS\u2019 preparations for the possibility that the Supreme Court rules in King v.
