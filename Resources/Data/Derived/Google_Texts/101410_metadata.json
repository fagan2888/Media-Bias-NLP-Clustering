But he\u2019s still polling better than Mike Huckabee, Ted Cruz, Jeb Bush, Rick Santorum, Chris Christie and Donald Trump.\n\nSo, is it time for Voldemort to throw his hat in the ring? Probably not. Unfortunately for him the WaPo poll suggests the three real dark horses in the race are the Terminator, Darth Vader, and Jaws the Shark, who came in first, second, and third, respectively, and have favorability ratings that blow everyone else (including Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders) out of the water. Sadly, America just doesn\u2019t seem ready for a Death Eater candidacy yet.\n\nNick Arnold is a researcher for the American Principles Project.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Pulse 2016", "description": "When BBC Newsbeat tweeted that people were starting to compare GOP front runner Donald Trump with the wizarding world\u2019s greatest villain, Dark Lord Voldemort, Harry Potter author J.K.
