The upcoming episode of \"This is Life With Lisa Ling\" explores the scourge of prescription drug abuse in Utah and within its Mormon community at10 p.m. ET/PT Sunday on CNN.\n\nOpinion By Jill Strasburg, special to CNN\n\n(CNN) - I became deathly ill two months into my marriage and during my long recovery, I could barely eat or drink. I certainly couldn\u2019t do daily chores around the house, and I would stay in my pajamas throughout most days.\n\nDuring this time, something remarkable happened: Women from my congregation whom I had never met began showing up at my house.\n\nI was new to the area, had just joined the local Mormon church, and here were these women at my house with a gift, a meal for my husband, a smile, a hug and a sympathetic ear. They expected nothing in return. I could feel the love they had for me as it radiated from them.\n\nThat wasn\u2019t the only thing I felt though.\n\nI started to become insecure with my appearance and the state of my home. This wasn\u2019t because of anything those amazing women said or did. When they would come visit me, they were completely \u201cput together,\u201d and I began to think that they were perfect.\n\nSo I stopped answering my door. I didn\u2019t want them to see me sick or see that the house wasn\u2019t cleaned up. The thoughts I was having made me feel like I was, somehow, less of a woman.\n\nI was beginning to realize that I was living in a culture of attaining perfection. And I started to wonder, why do so many Mormon women strive for perfection?\n\nLisa Ling: Inside Utah\u2019s drug addiction\n\nWhile I\u2019m not a historian, scholar or official representative for the LDS church, I think this obsession with perfection is rooted in the church\u2019s historical values and traditions.\n\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was founded in the 1830s, and its rejection by the broader Christian American community led members of the church to rely heavily on each other. This created strong bonds and unity within the community.\n\nWomen frequently met together in a group known as the General Relief Society. They met as friends, shared in their sisterhood and provided charitable acts of service to those in need.\n\nAdditionally, the women followed traditional roles of womanhood. They definitely had their hands full. They were mothers and wives, homemakers, neighbors and friends. They worked hard for their families while doing the required chores of a pioneer woman in the 1800s.\n\nOften, their husbands would go on proselytizing missions for the church, which left them to do everything for their families. Modern LDS hymns still tell stories of the hardships the women faced, and their ability to truly smile and be happy throughout.\n\nThe LDS church still promotes the traditional values of these strong, remarkable women. And I believe that, as modern LDS women, we are trying to continue forward in the same spirit as our predecessors.\n\nHowever, traditional roles are ever changing in our modern society.\n\nSo, as LDS women, we accept our new roles while trying our hardest to maintain the traditions that helped form who we are. This can often look like perfection.\n\nI\u2019ve learned that the fa\u00e7ade of perfection is just that. LDS women presented it as they walked across the plains. Their quiet dignity helped strengthen those around them. But, as I\u2019ve witnessed, this fa\u00e7ade of perfection can also be incredibly damaging.\n\nAs I recovered from my illness, my friendships continued to blossom, and I was able to go to my new friends\u2019 homes and visit. I know that some people can\u2019t stand the \u201cpop in,\u201d but I liked stopping in unannounced so that I could share my love with the women who loved me.\n\nHowever, this tended to be a risk that could devolve into chaos.\n\nInstead of sitting down and visiting, my friends would immediately apologize for how messy their house was, or how bad their appearance was that day.\n\nThen, the inevitable excuses would begin to be made. I always tried to reinforce that I didn\u2019t care, or that it wasn\u2019t nearly as bad as they were making it out to be, but, truthfully, I understood exactly how they were feeling.\n\nSo I promised myself that I was going to focus on my visitors instead of the things that I had been worried about. Dirty dishes be damned!\n\nAs a result, my relationships became stronger, more honest and loving, and they felt real. Particularly, my friends were opening up about their trials, fears, desires and heartaches.\n\nIn my home, they were safe and free to be honest in all ways. They allowed themselves to be the imperfect people that made them beautiful.\n\nThe illusion of perfection was gone.\n\nWe all know that perfection is unattainable, but we should still strive to be the best we can be every day. If we could actually be perfect, there would be nothing to work toward.There wouldn\u2019t be anything left to gain from this life that we live. We would miss out on the beautiful things around us.\n\nI know that some days my best was just opening my eyes and thanking God for another day.\n\nInstead of trying to prove to the world that we\u2019re perfect, we as women - especially LDS women - should let go of that need and embrace the imperfections that make us the amazing women that we are.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Editor\u2019s note:\u00a0 Jill Strasburg is a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, a wife and a writer who muses on life, love and faith in her blog The Strasburg Family.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "title": "Confessions of a Mormon housewife", "og": {"url": "http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2014/10/02/confessions-of-a-mormon-housewife/", "image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/141002071514-jill-strasburg-mormon-blogger-story-top.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Editor\u2019s note:\u00a0 Jill Strasburg is a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, a wife and a writer who muses on life, love and faith in her blog The Strasburg Family.", "title": "Confessions of a Mormon housewife"}, "msvalidate.01": "DE341CAC7D45B696ED1776216C18054C", "fb": {"admins": 690014395, "app_id": 80401312489}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CNN Belief Blog", "keywords": "church of jesus christ of latter-day saints, inspiration, mormonism, mormon, women", "google-site-verification": "mFBa4OnyEDU23vgVJ6rtX_4izud7FIi9JiscfVsWaKk", "original-source": "http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2014/10/02/confessions-of-a-mormon-housewife/", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico"}, "article_summary": "I didn\u2019t want them to see me sick or see that the house wasn\u2019t cleaned up.\nAnd I believe that, as modern LDS women, we are trying to continue forward in the same spirit as our predecessors.\nLDS women presented it as they walked across the plains.\nSo, as LDS women, we accept our new roles while trying our hardest to maintain the traditions that helped form who we are.\nThe LDS church still promotes the traditional values of these strong, remarkable women."}
