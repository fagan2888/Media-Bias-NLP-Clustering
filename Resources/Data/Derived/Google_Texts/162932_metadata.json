Rockwall County\u2019s uninsured rate dropped 4 percentage points over the same period.\n\nBut in Collin, Denton and Tarrant counties, the percentage of uninsured residents has been up and down over the five-year period.\n\nDr. Lloyd Potter, the Texas state demographer, said that while some people have received medical coverage through Medicaid, Medicare or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, data from the Dallas and Houston metro areas show reasons for concern.\n\n\u201cThe first thing that came to my mind is we\u2019re not seeing any real headway in getting higher percentages of people private insurance coverage,\u201d Potter said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re still one of the states with the highest percentage of the population that doesn\u2019t have insurance in some form. That\u2019s problematic.\u201d\n\nThe 2013 numbers from the ACS arrived the same week as another government study, conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It measured changes in uninsured numbers in the first three months of 2014, when the Affordable Care Act took effect.\n\nAcross the U.S., the percentage of uninsured adults fell from 20.4 percent to 18.4 percent in the first quarter of 2014 in the CDC\u2019s National Health Interview Survey, in part because of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe data in the 2013 American Community Survey study included people with private health insurance and public coverage: Medicare, Medicaid, the CHIP program and state health plans.\n\nAge and employment made considerable differences in the percentages.\n\nIn Dallas County, for example, 32.7 percent of people with jobs were uninsured, compared with 58.7 percent of people who were unemployed and 40.9 percent of those not in the labor force.\n\nChildren in Dallas County less than 18 years old had the lowest uninsured rate at 15.1 percent, as did children in other North Texas counties.\n\nOverall, 14.9 percent of residents in Collin County were without insurance; 15.7 percent in Denton County; 12.6 percent in Rockwall County; and 20.7 percent in Tarrant County, the ACS estimated.\n\nNationally, Potter said, the Dallas-Fort Worth and Houston metropolitan areas rank near the bottom in medical insurance coverage.\n\nThat could be a factor of increasing income inequity in Texas\u2019 major metropolitan areas.\n\n\u201cIf you look at incomes in Harris County, you can see a real trend toward increasing inequity,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are a higher percentage of people now in lower income brackets, and increases in the highest two income brackets.\n\n\u201cBut with this shift to lower income brackets or the highest ones, the middle is decreasing.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Dallas and Rockwall counties saw rates drop over a three-year period before the launch of the Affordable Care Act.", "og": {"description": "Dallas and Rockwall counties saw rates drop over a three-year period before the launch of the Affordable Care Act.", "title": "Census shows small gains in coverage of uninsured in Dallas area", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/news/metro/20140917-census-shows-small-gains-in-coverage-of-uninsured-in-dallas-area.ece", "image": {"width": 345, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/resrsc/images/facebook-default.jpg", "height": 345}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2014-09-18T05:28:36Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2014-09-18T04:14:47Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Census shows small gains in coverage of uninsured in Dallas area\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/news/metro/20140917-census-shows-small-gains-in-coverage-of-uninsured-in-dallas-area.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/resrsc/images/facebook-default.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"1925351\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-09-18T04:14:47Z\", \"section\": \"Metro\", \"author\": \"MICHAEL E.
