He will return to the classroom and teach classes in education law, constitutional law and racial discrimination.\n\nBoger found himself recently in the public spotlight when members of the UNC board of governors and university administrators became alarmed over highly critical columns UNC law professor Gene Nichol has been writing about policies under Republican Gov. Pat McCrory. Among the most controversial was an October editorial in the News & Observer where Nichol, a tenured professor and director of the UNC Center on Poverty, Work and Opportunity, compared McCrory to Jim Crow-era Southern politicians for backing restrictive changes to the state\u2019s voting laws.\n\n(Note: Nichol is a board member of the N.C. Justice Center, the larger anti-poverty non-profit that N.C. Policy Watch is a part of).\n\nNichol was subsequently asked to give university administrators a \u201cheads up\u201d when his monthly columns appear in the News & Observer, with a tagline informing readers that Nichol was not speaking for UNC.\n\nThe News & Observer reported in April that Boger had sent the email to Nichol outlining the unusual arrangement to keep UNC Chancellor Carol Folt, UNC Provost Jim Dean and the board of trustees aware of what Nichol was writing.\n\n\u201cExpressions of faculty views can sometimes provoke strong external or internal disagreement that leads unhappy listeners to threaten financial harm or injury,\u201d Boger wrote in an Oct. 21 email to Nichol, according to the News & Observer. \u201cThe Chancellor, the Provost, and the Board of Trustees must necessarily be alert, of course, to the prospect of real injury to the University. They do not intend, however, for threats to undermine their broad support of free expression by faculty members.\u201d\n\nThe UNC system has seen significant drops in state funding in recent years, and more cuts for the 17-school system are expected for the fiscal year starting this July. McCrory\u2019s budget proposal included $49 million in cuts to the UNC system, and Republican legislative leaders have yet to release their budget proposals.\n\nBoger said his decision to step down wasn\u2019t based on the recent controversies over Nichol\u2019s columns.\n\n\u201cIn terms of the pressures on a dean, that\u2019s a fraction but a small fraction,\u201d Boger said.\n\nNichol praised Boger\u2019s commitment to freedom of expression, calling him \u201ca good dean in a tough era.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m particularly grateful that he\u2019s worked hard trying to protect free speech and academic freedom \u2014 especially in the last year or two when the provost [Jim Dean] and chancellor [Carol Folt] haven\u2019t been as committed to those values as Jack is,\u201d Nichol wrote in an email.\n\nThe recent years of budget cuts created challenges for the law school, Boger said, and he was pleased with how he was able to steer the law school through what he compared to four years of gale-force winds for a boat at sea.\n\n\u201cIt probably does add to the stress levels,\u201d he said. \u201cI would wish for very smooth sailing ahead.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 71966175060}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cropped-logo_shadow-square-270x270.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "The recent years of budget cuts created challenges for the law school, Boger said, and he was pleased with how he was able to steer the law school through what he compared to four years of gale-force winds for a boat at sea.\nHe will return to the classroom and teach classes in education law, constitutional law and racial discrimination.\nThe dean of the University of North Carolina\u2019s law school is stepping down, saying that he wants to make room for new leadership to steer an upcoming fundraising campaign and ambitious curriculum changes.\nMcCrory\u2019s budget proposal included $49 million in cuts to the UNC system, and Republican legislative leaders have yet to release their budget proposals.\nBoger has taught at the university for a quarter-century, and was a deputy director at the law school\u2019s Center for Civil Rights before his 2006 appointment to lead the law school."}
