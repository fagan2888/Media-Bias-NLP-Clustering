Photo courtesy of The Associated Press\n\nIt\u2019s been over 70 years since hundreds of thousands of South Korean women were turned into sex slaves by the Japanese military during World War II. But on Monday, South Korea and Japan finally reached an apology agreement. Of the 238 South Korean women who\u2019ve come forward as so-called \u201ccomfort women\u201d since the end of the war, only 46 are alive to witness Japan\u2019s pledge of 1 billion yen ($8.3 million), which will go to a foundation meant to provide health care and other services to victims, most of whom are now in their 80s and 90s.\n\n\u201cThe issue of \u2018comfort women\u2019 was a matter which, with the involvement of the military authorities of the day, severely injured the honor and dignity of many women,\u201d said Japan Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida on Monday during a news conference in Seoul, South Korea, according to The New York Times. \u201cIn this regard, the government of Japan painfully acknowledges its responsibility.\u201d\n\nWomen suffered through sexual slavery from as early as the 1910s until Japan\u2019s World War II defeat in 1945. During this time, the Japanese military would invade villages in their neighboring country, kidnap women, and place them in military brothels scattered across several countries. It was not uncommon for 14-year-old girls to be forced into performing sexual acts on soldiers.\n\nNow 89 years old, Kim Bok-dong was one of those girls. In an interview with CNN, she recalled seemingly endless days in which soldiers lined up outside the brothel, typically from noon to 8 p.m. \"When it was over, I couldn't even get up. It went on for such a long time,\" Bok-dong said. \"By the time the sun went down, I couldn't use my lower body at all. There are no words to describe my suffering. Even now, I can't live without medicine. I'm always in pain.\"\n\nThe meeting came to a conclusion after 12 rounds of negotiations spanning as far back as spring 2014. Once officials reached an agreement, they concluded the issue of comfort women would be \u201cfinally and irreversibly solved\u201d \u2014 and that bilateral ties would be strengthened between the two countries. However, several advocates for former comfort women say the deal isn\u2019t enough to compensate for the pervasive torture. Historians continue to debate how many women were sent to be sex slaves, although current estimates hover around 200,000.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a humiliating diplomacy for South Korea to give a bushel only to get a peck,\u201d the Korean Council for the Women Drafted for Military Sexual Slavery said, according to The Times. \u201cThe agreement is nothing but a diplomatic collusion that thoroughly betrayed the wishes of comfort women and the South Korean people.\u201d\n\nAccording to the American Psychological Association, victims of sexual slavery experience complex physical and psychological harm, including: starvation, exposure to sexually transmitted diseases, beatings, rape, and gang rape, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety, suicide, and substance abuse. Considering this, some victims say money will not make up for the dozens of years of abuse, which was largely kept in the dark even after it ended.\n\n\u201cThe agreement does not reflect the views of former comfort women,\u201d said 88-year-old Lee Yong-soo, a former comfort woman, according to The Times. \u201cI will ignore it completely. We are not craving for money. What we demand is that Japan make official reparations for the crime it had committed.\u201d\n\nYong-soo said Japan must admit legal responsibility and offer formal, personal apologies to the women who were affected. Instead, she says the agreement is simply a political tool meant to repair the two countries\u2019 relationships. Adding to their dissatisfaction, the women were not present during the negotiations.\n\nThe agreement isn\u2019t enough, Hiroka Shoji, an East Asia researcher at Amnesty International, told The Times. \u201cUntil the women get the full and unreserved apology from the Japanese government for the crimes committed against them, the fight for justice goes on.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "japan, apologizes, comfort, women, used, sex, slaves, during, world, war, ii, survivors, still", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "World War II sex slaves have received an apology, but after years of trauma, the surviving victims did not receive it well.", "title": "Why World War II Sex Slaves Won't Accept Japan's Million-Dollar Apology", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/japan-apologizes-comfort-women-used-sex-slaves-during-world-war-ii-survivors-still-367064", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/12/28/korean-comfort-women.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "World War II sex slaves have received an apology, but after years of trauma, the surviving victims did not receive it well.", "title": "Why World War II Sex Slaves Won't Accept Japan's Million-Dollar Apology", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/japan-apologizes-comfort-women-used-sex-slaves-during-world-war-ii-survivors-still-367064", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/12/28/korean-comfort-women.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/12/28/korean-comfort-women.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Hill", "published_time": "2015-12-28T17:20:09-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-28T17:20:06-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "World War II sex slaves have received an apology, but after years of trauma, the surviving victims did not receive it well."}, "article_summary": "However, several advocates for former comfort women say the deal isn\u2019t enough to compensate for the pervasive torture.\nPhoto courtesy of The Associated PressIt\u2019s been over 70 years since hundreds of thousands of South Korean women were turned into sex slaves by the Japanese military during World War II.\nSurviving \"comfort women\" from Korea speak out about the government's decision to forgive Japan for sex slavery.\n\u201cIn this regard, the government of Japan painfully acknowledges its responsibility.\u201dWomen suffered through sexual slavery from as early as the 1910s until Japan\u2019s World War II defeat in 1945.\n\u201cThe agreement does not reflect the views of former comfort women,\u201d said 88-year-old Lee Yong-soo, a former comfort woman, according to The Times."}
