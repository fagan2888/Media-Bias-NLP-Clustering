The officer can be seen telling Ms. Christopherson that she needed to leave the area for the safety of the child, a local ABC affiliate reported.\n\n\u201cYour child doesn\u2019t have hearing protection on,\u201d the officer can be heard saying. \u201cThe crowd is going to start surging forward. Where you\u2019re at, your child can get crushed. So we\u2019re afraid of your child getting crushed, and we\u2019re afraid of your child\u2019s eardrums being hurt, OK. That is borderline, probably, child endangerment.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you know that the security guards asked me to stop breastfeeding my child?\u201d Ms. Christopherson asks, the station reported.\n\n\u201cThis has nothing to do with the breastfeeding. I\u2019m explaining to you, it\u2019s your child getting crushed with everyone getting pushed forward,\u201d the officer explains.\n\nThe officer then gives the woman the options of either moving to a safer location or leaving the concert and receiving a full refund.\n\nMs. Christopherson chose the latter, but the video has caused outrage on social media by people who believe she was targeted for her breastfeeding.\n\nCarmen Cooley-Graham, who was in the same section as as Ms. Christopherson and witnessed the incident, agreed that it was all about breastfeeding, not the child\u2019s safety. She told the station that no one said anything to the mother until two hours into the event.\n\n\u201cAll of the sudden they said we have complaints of you breastfeeding. Really?\u201d said Ms. Colley-Graham.\n\nMs. Cooley-Graham said she believes a couple of young women who tried, and failed, to enter the pit area reported Ms. Christopherson to security. She said after Ms. Christopherson was forced to leave, she saw one of the women give the security guard a high-five, the ABC affiliate reported.\n\n\u201cNot once was this child showing any signs of distress,\u201d Ms. Cooley-Graham said.\n\nMs. Christopherson said she had taken her baby to concerts before at Sleep Train Amphitheatre with no issues and questioned why she was allowed to bring the infant in at all if it was such a dangerous place, the station reported.\n\nShe said she will seek the advice of an attorney and that she plans to join other mothers at a \u201cnurse-in\u201d outside Sleep Train Amphitheatre in the near future.\n\n\u201cI want to stand up for all nursing women and stand up for what\u2019s right,\u201d she told the station. \u201cIt was completely a cop-out. They\u2019re trying to cover this up because they know they legally cannot remove me for nursing.\u201d\n\nThe Chula Vista Police Department said in a statement that its involvement in the incident \u201cwas due to the welfare and safety of the infant and not due to a mother\u2019s legal right to breastfeed in public.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A California woman says she was escorted by police out of Brad Paisley's concert in Chula Vista Thursday night because she was breastfeeding her baby in the pit area.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A California woman says she was escorted by police out of Brad Paisley\u2019s concert in Chula Vista Thursday night because she was breastfeeding her baby in the pit area.", "title": "Mom says she was booted from Brad Paisley concert for breastfeeding", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jul/13/mom-says-she-was-booted-brad-paisley-concert-breas/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/07/13/paisley-mom.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/07/13/paisley-mom.jpg", "description": "A California woman says she was escorted by police out of Brad Paisley's concert in Chula Vista Thursday night because she was breastfeeding her baby in the pit area.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Mom says she was booted from Brad Paisley concert for breastfeeding"}, "Author": "Jessica Chasmar", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Megan Christopherson, Sleep Train Amphitheatre, ABC"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb7b0\"", "article_summary": "Ms. Christopherson chose the latter, but the video has caused outrage on social media by people who believe she was targeted for her breastfeeding.\nA California woman says she was escorted by police out of Brad Paisley\u2019s concert in Chula Vista Thursday night because she was breastfeeding her baby in the pit area.\nCarmen Cooley-Graham, who was in the same section as as Ms. Christopherson and witnessed the incident, agreed that it was all about breastfeeding, not the child\u2019s safety.\nMs. Cooley-Graham said she believes a couple of young women who tried, and failed, to enter the pit area reported Ms. Christopherson to security.\nIn the video, the Chula Vista police officer removes the woman from the pit area and takes her outside."}
