The sale garnered national attention after it was spotlighted by the popular Drudge Report.\n\nReads an SOE press release: \u201cSOE is now partnering with VASTEC, a leading accessibility access provider to state and federal government clients. VASTEC currently provides Section 508 compliance services at the highest government levels, including the Social Security Administration, U.S. Department of Defense, and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.\u201d\n\n\u201cVASTEC offers accessibility services and remediation tailored to the client\u2019s needs,\u201d said Shelby Tudor, VASTEC\u2019s program manager for accessibility services.\n\nAaron Klein\u2019s \u201cImpeachable Offenses: The Case to Remove Barack Obama from Office\u201d is available, autographed, at the WND Superstore\n\nContinued Tudor: \u201cThis includes review and consultation of websites, remediation of current content or development of new material, and regular review to ensure accessibility is maintained as the website grows. We are proud to partner with SOE to provide these services to the Elections Community.\u201d\n\nVASTEC boasts an extensive list of U.S. government contracts.\n\nBesides the SSA, Pentagon and Veterans Affairs department, VASTEC has been contracted by Department of Commerce, National Technical Information Service, U.S. Patent & Trademark Office, General Services Administration, Treasury Department, Veterans Benefits Administration, Health & Human Services, Health Resources and Services Administration, Government Printing Office, IRS Alternative Media Center and more.\n\nVASTEC\u2019s Tudor, quoted in the press release, previously worked for Enable America and was an Obama for America digital media intern in 2012, according to his LinkedIn profile.\n\nScytl\u2019s new partnership comes one month after President Obama\u2019s special commission on election reform recommended future electronic voting, even suggesting tablet computers, such as iPads, be used to cast votes, as WND exclusively reported.\n\nObama\u2019s 10-person Presidential Commission on Election Administration released its recommendations last month in a 99-page document available online.\n\nMuch of the media coverage of the commission\u2019s conclusions focused on a summary of key recommendations provided by the White House.\n\nThe recommendations are:\n\nModernization of the registration process through continued expansion of online voter registration and expanded state collaboration in improving the accuracy of voter lists;\n\nMeasures to improve access to the polls through expansion of the period for voting before the traditional Election Day, and through the selection of suitable, well-equipped polling place facilities, such as schools;\n\nState-of-the-art techniques to assure efficient management of polling places;\n\nReforms of the standard-setting and certification process for new voting technology to address soon-to-be antiquated voting machines and to encourage innovation and the adoption of widely available off-the-shelf technologies.\n\nHowever, a WND review of the commission\u2019s full paper finds far more extensive recommendations for electronic voting.\n\nThe document states: \u201cSoftware-only products can be integrated with off-the-shelf commercial hardware components such as computers, laptops, tablets, scanners, printers, and even machine-readable code scanners and signature pad products.\n\n\u201cTablet computers such as iPads are common components of these new technologies. They can be integrated into the check-in, voting, and verification processes in the polling place.\u201d\n\nThe commission called attention to new technologies that allow voters to \u201cpre-fill\u201d sample ballots at home that can be later scanned at the polling place.\n\nThe panel addressed concerns that such technologies can be hacked.\n\nThe commission stated: \u201cThe fact that a tablet or off-the-shelf computer can be hacked or can break down does not mean such technology is inherently less secure than existing ballot marking methods if proper precautions are taken.\u201d\n\nThe concept of electronic voting is already being tested.\n\nWND reported in 2012 that Scytl announced the successful implementation of technology that allows ballots to be cast using Google and Apple smartphones and tablet computers.\n\nObama\u2019s panel was chaired by Robert F. Bauer, the president\u2019s personal attorney who served as White House counsel until 2011.\n\nWith additional research by Brenda J.
