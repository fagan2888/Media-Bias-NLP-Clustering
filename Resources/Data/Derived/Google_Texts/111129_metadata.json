With increasing numbers of clinics, practitioners and hospitals adopting EHRs through Meaningful Use, the discussion has exploded across the internet, and even leading to a National HealthIT Week, a weeklong convention discussing new ideas and present issues in the US healthIT industry.\n\nSEE ALSO: There's a Massive Transformation Happening in Healthcare Technology\n\nNew health-tech blogs seem to spring up every week, and tech news heavy-hitters like Gigaom and Venturebeat are featuring stories on the impacts of EHRs with increasing frequency. The variety of subjects in the discussion has increased dramatically too.\n\nNow, the focus is not so much \u201cWhat the heck is an EHR?\u201d and \u201cWhy the heck should I bother with an EHR?\u201d but has expanded to encompass security, functionality, and efficiency metrics, and so much more. The amount of discussion on these topics has provided some incredible insight that we should be taking note of.\n\nMeaningful use has lead to the mass adoption, competition and Darwinian struggle for supremacy in the EHR, EMR, and digital health environment. Specialized clinical apps to sprawling, hospital-wide infrastructures currently saturate the US market. The ecosystem is ripe for it; Meaningful Use provides financial incentives for private practices to adopt EHR and health IT solutions that fall into MU guidelines, essentially paying them to use a service that will save them money.\n\nWith such a highly competitive environment already existing within their privatized healthcare system, such incentives to potentially streamline their business models are hard to pass up. However, having such incentives to promote rapid competition and growth presents its own risks\u2014with so many EHR tools coming out of the woodwork, there\u2019s bound to be half-baked, phony bologna pretenders that squeak through MU screening, who simply give clinics an excuse to buy iPads for their office. Those EHR platforms end up costing the practitioner time, money and manpower, through poorly implemented design and stunted functionality, simply because the sooner they could get it MU-certified and to market, the faster they could take advantage of the incentives. It\u2019s these stumbles in EHR adoption that we should be wary of when we look at adoption in the Canadian healthcare industry.\n\nHowever, to say Canada is doing nothing to support EHR implementation is a gross misrepresentation; organizations like Canada Health Infoways are instrumental in our transition to a national digital healthcare system, providing support, investment and interoperability projects in partner with both provincial and federal governments. By 2011 they reported having succeeded in having put in place the \u201ccore elements\u201d of an electronic health record for 50% of Canadians.\n\nRELATED: How a Startup Mindset Could Save Canadian Healthcare\n\n\n\n\n\nIn overall adoption however, compared to the United States, Canada is still lagging behind. Over 80% of US hospitals have transitioned to an EHR system, as well as 50% of doctor\u2019s offices, and having a nation-wide adoption rate of 70% among primary care physicians in 2013. Our overall adoption rate is just touching 57%\u2014well below the US, and the US is even lower than Norway, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Australia and Germany, respectively. Granted, those European countries are in a much different situation than Canada\u2014their landmass is a fraction of ours, their population density is magnitudes above our own, and their relationship with healthcare is typically much less controversial.\n\nBut how can we apply what\u2019s going on down south of the border to our own country, Canada? Healthcare is traditionally a very reactive industry: we adapt and react when a problem arises, but especially within the realm of healthcare information technology and communication we seem to be stuck in a \u201cif it ain\u2019t broke\u201d mentality. This lack of foresight and eagerness to innovate and embrace change has the possibility of leaving us scrambling for new ideas in the coming years.\n\nWe also lack, for better or worse, the hyper-competitive climate brought about by both privatized healthcare and Meaningful Use; and while the legacy of Tommy Douglas is an iconic badge of honour that Canada proudly wears for the rest of the world to see, the bureaucracy involved\u2014in addition to factors unique to Canada, like being of one of the lowest population densities of any G20 country\u2014does lead to some stagnation in adopting new ideas and technologies within healthcare. Such stubborn behaviours are most likely one of the key reasons why Canada isn\u2019t even in the top 25 of the World Health Organization\u2019s global index of healthcare systems\n\nAccording to the 2013 National Physician Survey, only 45% of licensed physicians contacted reported having \u201csatisfactory\u201d access to EHRs, only 11% having \u201cexcellent\u201d access and 42% having unsatisfactory access, not including territories. By province, the only provinces with more satisfied than unsatisfied were (in order) Alberta, Ontario, British Columbia, Saskatchewan and Manitoba. Quebec reported a whopping 68% unsatisfied. That only 11% actually have good-to-great EHR solutions\u2014where they\u2019re not creating more work through workarounds and poorly designed functionality\u2014is indeed troubling. Canadian healthcare ought to be amazing, not summed up by a non-committal shrug.\n\nMUST READ: A 'Perfect Storm' is Brewing in Digital Healthcare\n\n\n\n\n\nWith healthcare tax and expenditure being a hot topic seemingly every election both provincial and federal, EHR could be the panacea our healthcare system needs: a way to lower costs, thereby lowering taxpayer burden, and a way to improve quality and quantity of care in preparation for the future. With a rapidly aging generation ready to retire, we need to drastically improve our capabilities of caring for each other.\n\nIn an industry where the technological gap remains high\u2014with many primary care providers and private organizations still using pen, paper and fax as their primary means of record-keeping and communication\u2014there needs to be the same kind of pressure to adapt as in the US that has been brought on by consumer demand.\n\nThat consumer demand does in fact exist in Canada. In a recent study presented by Canada Health Infoway, \u201c89% [of Canadians] feel it is important that they personally have full advantage of digital health tools and capabilities.\u201d The unfortunate aspect to that statistic is that such high demand won\u2019t necessarily be felt by the healthcare industry; clinics and hospitals aren\u2019t as outwardly competitive, and our health insurance doesn\u2019t dock us for going to a doctor without EHR.\n\nWhile that pressure is likely to come about naturally when our healthcare system is overloaded with new retirees and looking for ways to streamline their patient load, I strongly believe that Canadian healthcare needs to be looking to the future now. MU has provided the incentive for rapid and often reckless progress for advances in health IT, but I fear such incentives will neither be seen nor felt in Canada, though we share the same aging demographic.\n\nWithout current pressure to adapt competitively, I fear many homecare organizations will attempt to address the new waves of patients by simply hiring more people, as opposed to adopting new technology. Getting more people to row your leaky boat isn\u2019t smart in the long run; you\u2019re more likely to sink before you see the shore. We stand at the forefront of a brave new world in healthcare technology. Should we choose to embrace it, we have the ability to drastically improve the quality we can afford to our fellow Canadians, as well as the ability to swiftly adapt to the growing number of Canadians that will require more attentive care, both at-home and in hospital.\n\nIf we want to be fully prepared for the future, and put Canada\u2019s healthcare system back on the map, I fully believe that strong, smart EHR adoption is the answer.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"description": "As the CEO of a Canadian healthcare information technology and electronic health record software company, I like to keep appraised of goings-on in the healthcare industry, locally and...", "site": "@techvibes", "card": "summary", "title": "Embracing the Digital Age: EHRs, Meaningful Use, and Canadian..."}, "description": "As the CEO of a Canadian healthcare information technology and electronic health record software company, I like to keep appraised", "generator": "Techvibes.com Engine/PHP5, created: 2016-05-25 | 10:28:53 PM | 0.466s"}, "_id": "\"57477af56914bd0286fe513b\"", "article_summary": "It\u2019s these stumbles in EHR adoption that we should be wary of when we look at adoption in the Canadian healthcare industry.\nWith such a highly competitive environment already existing within their privatized healthcare system, such incentives to potentially streamline their business models are hard to pass up.\nIf we want to be fully prepared for the future, and put Canada\u2019s healthcare system back on the map, I fully believe that strong, smart EHR adoption is the answer.\nMeaningful use has lead to the mass adoption, competition and Darwinian struggle for supremacy in the EHR, EMR, and digital health environment.\nWhile that pressure is likely to come about naturally when our healthcare system is overloaded with new retirees and looking for ways to streamline their patient load, I strongly believe that Canadian healthcare needs to be looking to the future now."}
