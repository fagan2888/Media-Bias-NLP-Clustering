(Photo: University of Wisconsin-Madison Archives)\n\nI was saddened by Bill Lueders' article about UW-Madison's ethically questionable experimentation on the baby monkeys (\"On the death of my monkey,\" Nov. 13).\n\nI find it difficult to believe that such experimentation could be characterized in any way other than cruel and ill-conceived. It is a travesty that our tax dollars often pay for UW's \"anything goes animal experimentation\" ostensibly in the name of \"scientific progress.\" Despite significant public outrage, UW-Madison has recently resumed experimenting on newborn monkeys using a version of Harry Harlow's controversial and barbaric maternal deprivation tactics that involve mentally tormenting these infants.\n\nGiven that infant monkeys experience anguish similar to humans, the experimentation was rightly condemned by the medical community decades ago as it should be now. As UW revels in their recent $100 million cash donation and begins an aggressive campaign across Wisconsin to solicit monies from alumni like me, I urge readers to withhold their support of our university until UW gets its moral compass in order.\n\nInstead, a donation to your local church, homeless shelter or animal rescue would help organizations that desperately need our dollars and foster compassion toward life.\n\nDr. Ruth A.
