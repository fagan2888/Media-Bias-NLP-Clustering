Every Monday, Wednesday and Friday, senior citizens in Cooperstown walk around a track at the Clark Sports Center. People who walk said this program definitely helps them, especially since winter can be so rough in central New York.

"Very much so, I lack vitamin d as it is and it's very difficult to get out and do what you need to do," said Robin Gray of Cooperstown.

This is the fifteenth year for the walking program at the center. Some people said they do it to stay in shape as they get older.

"I had a heart attack and a stent line, eleven years ago, so this gives me a great opportunity to walk over the winter. It's the best thing for it," said Helen Mclaughlin of Cooperstown.

Organizers of the program sadi the benefits of it go beyond staying in shape.

"I think that just by walking and socializing with others here and being able to come out and have a good time, I think they just enjoy it and it makes for a happy time," said assistant program director Deborah Bennett.

People walking said the social aspect is a major benefit for them.

"In the winter it’s a lot slower, so I want to try to keep up those social skills. Getting out, otherwise you can go months without seeing people around here. It's really difficult," said Gray.

“You get to see people you normally don’t get to over the winter. During the spring and summer here you do more outside activities, so it's a nice little social program," said Mclaughlin.

Walkers said this program is what kicks starts a positive mood in the winter.

“Absolutely and it gets you out of the house three days a week. You know, really early. This way you go out and do your errands in the afternoon. It's a phenomenal program. Everyone is very nice," said Mclaughlin.

The group is in their second month of walking. Some of them have already walked over forty miles. They'll continue to walk until the weather gets nice in the spring.
