With that in mind, the founders of StudyRoom built a platform that focused on allowing students to connect for collaboration and study aid.\n\nEmerson Malca, co-founder and CEO of StudyRoom, told TechCrunch that the idea began when a friend reached out to him for help with homework. His friend only had two classmates\u2019 phone numbers, making Malca realize how poor the communication options were for students, despite being part of such a well-connected generation.\n\nWorking like a social network, a school page covers news items about the university, like upcoming events or student inquires about specific classes or professors. On a page for a particular class, students can share notes, ask one another questions, build study groups and similar activities.\n\nThough the portal is designed with students in mind, there have been some professors joining the site as well. Other professors are less than pleased with the site.\n\nMalca explained that some professors wanted more control over the site and the ability to moderate the activity of students, but the co-founders wanted to keep the site student-focused.\n\nWith no moderation and notes available even from previous semesters, cheating is a worry of some professors.\n\nThough students can flag one another for bad behavior, there is no other policing going on. Flagged posts can be removed if they are considered by the company to be \u201cseriously cheating.\u201d\n\nIn the interview with TechCrunch, Malca didn\u2019t seem too worried about students cheating.\n\n\u201cHomework is just way for students to practice,\u201d he said in the interview, later reiterating that the online group isn\u2019t much different than an in-person one.\n\nStudyRoom is currently available in 100 schools across the U.S. Their only current revenue source is peer mentoring, where the company gets a cut of the mentor\u2019s $24 per hour pay.\n\nGet Free Updates!
