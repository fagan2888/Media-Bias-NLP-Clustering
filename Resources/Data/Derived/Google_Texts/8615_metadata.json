(AP) \u2014 A small hospital in Leadville that has served Lake County since 1879 is closing its doors.\n\nSt. Vincent Hospital, a 25-bed hospital at 10,152 feet, announced Saturday it will phase out services over the next few months.\n\nThe decision came after Lake County voters this month rejected a property tax hike to support the struggling rural hospital, the Summit Daily reported (http://bit.ly/1vp56Z4 ).\n\nThe hospital was founded by a group of nuns from Kansas who arrived in Leadville to provide medical services to the booming mining town. But the hospital struggled to stay viable for the county population of about 7,300 people.\n\nAbout a dozen elderly patients living at the hospital have been moved to other nursing home facilities.\n\nThe surgery department will close this week, and the hospital\u2019s home oxygen, home health and physical therapy services and its general practice clinic will close in January.\n\nThe entire building should be shuttered by March 31, the newspaper reported.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m shocked by the number of people who have come up to me since the vote and said, \u2018I didn\u2019t believe it would happen,\u201d said Karen Rinehart, the hospital\u2019s director of community relations.\n\nHospital administrators are talking with local governments to see whether they can take over ambulance services. St. Vincent\u2019s emergency department and its support services will be the last to shut down.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very sad thing,\u201d said Sarah Vaine, CEO of the Summit Community Care Clinic. \u201cThe community really needs those resources.\u201d\n\nDr. Jim Oberheide, a Care Clinic founder and family practice physician who has worked at St. Vincent, called the closing bad news for Leadville, but not unexpected.\n\n\u201cThe days of small rural hospitals having full facilities and expecting to do everything is not realistic,\u201d he said.\n\nThe clinic and St. Anthony Summit Medical Center in Frisco expect to see more people from those areas because of the closure, the newspaper reported.\n\nThe Leadville hospital has been grappling for years with high workforce turnover, deteriorating facilities, outdated equipment and locals who\u2019ve chosen to use medical services farther away.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been struggling for a long time,\u201d Vaine said. \u201cIt\u2019s a testament to their commitment to the community that they\u2019ve stayed open as long as they have.\u201d\n\nThe hospital now employs 107 full- and part-time staff members.\n\nIn 1988, voters created a taxation district to support St. Vincent. That tax rate hasn\u2019t been raised since, and a ballot question to raise the mill levy to give the hospital another $1.6 million a year failed.\n\nRinehart said the hospital\u2019s message to voters was clear that voting no on the tax increase would mean the hospital would close.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s mind-blowing that people would allow, that the citizens would allow this to happen,\u201d she said.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nInformation from: Summit Daily News, http://www.summitdaily.com/", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Leadville hospital closing after 135 years", "title": "Leadville hospital closing after 135 years", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/11/19/leadville-hospital-closing-after-135-years/", "image": {"width": 620, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141119__st-vincentp1.jpg", "height": 410}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141119__st-vincentp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-19T08:02:37+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T16:58:28+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "St. Vincent Hospital, a 25-bed hospital at 10,152 feet, announced Saturday it will phase out services over the next few months.\nLEADVILLE, Colo.
