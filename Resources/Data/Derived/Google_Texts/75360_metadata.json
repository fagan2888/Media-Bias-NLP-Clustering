(ANDREW KNAPP/STAFF)\n\nA man who engaged in a three-hour standoff Friday with Charleston County sheriff\u2019s deputies, reportedly after shooting his girlfriend, died early Saturday from a gunshot wound, authorities said.\n\nThe Charleston County Coroner\u2019s Office identified the man as Cordell Bennett, 25, of North Charleston. The condition of Bennett\u2019s 24-year-old girlfriend was not clear Saturday.\n\nThe death stemmed from a reported domestic dispute shortly before 9 a.m. Friday at Mundy\u2019s Mobile Home Park, 4059 W. Montague Ave., according to an incident report released by the Sheriff\u2019s Office.\n\nDeputies and officers from the North Charleston Police Department rushed to the woman\u2019s mobile home after receiving a 911 call about reported shots fired.\n\nThe victim had called or sent a text message to her brother earlier in the morning, saying her boyfriend had shot her, Sheriff\u2019s Maj. Eric Watson said.\n\nA deputy who responded to the scene reported seeing the woman staggering in the road and walking in his direction, according to the report. Blood was visible on the woman\u2019s shirt and pants, the deputy reported, and she had what appeared to be gunshot wounds to her left shoulder and right hip.\n\nShe told the deputy her boyfriend, Bennett, was responsible for her wounds, the report said.\n\nParamedics transported her to the Medical University Hospital where she underwent surgery Friday.\n\nFirst responders heard at least one gunshot while tending to the woman. A standoff ensued between the man, sheriff\u2019s deputies, police and SWAT teams.\n\nInvestigators maneuvered a robot into the home around 11:25 a.m. and came across the man lying on a bedroom floor.\n\nThey entered the home to take the man into custody and found him breathing, but unresponsive.\n\nDeputies reported seeing a visible injury to the man\u2019s head, according to the incident report. A handgun was also found lying on the floor, deputies said.\n\nParamedics transported the man to Medical University Hospital for treatment of a gunshot wound. Bennett died at the hospital 3:46 a.m. Saturday, Deputy Coroner Kimberly Rhoton said. Whether or not the wound was self inflicted remains under investigation.\n\nReach Christina Elmore at 937-5908 or at Twitter.com/celmorePC.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Coroner\u2019s Office identifies man fatally shot after allegedly shooting girlfriend in Charleston County, FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsMetro, \r\nMetro, Charleston County Sheriff's Office,domestic violence,Fatal shooting,North Charleston Police Department", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "A man who engaged in a three-hour standoff Friday with Charleston County sheriff\u2019s deputies, reportedly after shooting his girlfriend, died early Saturday from a gunshot wound, authorities said.", "title": "Coroner\u2019s Office identifies man fatally shot after allegedly shooting girlfriend in Charleston County", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20150815/150819496/coroner-x2019-s-office-identifies-man-fatally-shot-after-allegedly-shooting-girlfriend-in-charleston-county", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150815/PC16/150819496/AR/0/AR-150819496.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150815/PC16/150819496/AR/0/AR-150819496.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A man who engaged in a three-hour standoff Friday with Charleston County sheriff\u2019s deputies, reportedly after shooting his girlfriend, died early Saturday from a gunshot wound, authorities said.", "title": "Coroner\u2019s Office identifies man fatally shot after allegedly shooting girlfriend in Charleston County", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@postandcourier", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150815/PC16/150819496/AR/0/AR-150819496.jpg?201508151955", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 150819496}}, "keywords": "Coroner\u2019s Office identifies man fatally shot after allegedly shooting girlfriend in Charleston County , FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsMetro, \r\nMetro, Charleston County Sheriff's Office,domestic violence,Fatal shooting,North Charleston Police Department", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-15T17:54:19Z", "modified_time": "2015-08-15T19:55:00Z", "author": "Christina Elmore"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "A man who engaged in a three-hour standoff Friday with Charleston County sheriff\u2019s deputies, reportedly after shooting his girlfriend, died early Saturday from a gunshot wound, authorities said."}, "article_summary": "The Charleston County Coroner\u2019s Office identified the man as Cordell Bennett, 25, of North Charleston.\n(ANDREW KNAPP/STAFF)A man who engaged in a three-hour standoff Friday with Charleston County sheriff\u2019s deputies, reportedly after shooting his girlfriend, died early Saturday from a gunshot wound, authorities said.\nA standoff ensued between the man, sheriff\u2019s deputies, police and SWAT teams.\nDeputies and officers from the North Charleston Police Department rushed to the woman\u2019s mobile home after receiving a 911 call about reported shots fired.\nParamedics transported the man to Medical University Hospital for treatment of a gunshot wound."}
