Just two other states have won approval for the type of alternative coverage plans Gov. Corbett wants to pursue.\n\nThe new waiver application delays until 2016 controversial changes that would apply to all able- bodied Medicaid recipients \u2014 specifically monthly premium payments and work search requirements \u2014 and lifts some limits on coverage proposed in its draft application released late last year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHealthy Pennsylvania is vital to providing a much needed safety net for the people that need it most.

Limits on lab testing, mental health and drug and alcohol services, were reduced, and monthly premium payments for those making above 100 percent of the federal poverty level ($23,850 for a family of four) would not start until the second year \u2013 and, for those between 50 percent and 100 percent, they would be dropped entirely for now.\n\nBut the administration is sticking to its most controversial proposal: a requirement for work-search or job training.\n\n\u201cWe believe it\u2019s important,\u201d said Mackereth. \u201cEncouraging employment ties in strongly to good health outcomes.\u201d\n\nShe said the goal is to remove people from public assistance. \u201cWe don\u2019t want people to remain on government-funded health insurance.

Most elements of the proposal do not need state legislative approval, Mackereth said.\n\nUnder the health law, the federal government covers 100 percent of the cost of enrolling the uninsured in Medicaid starting in 2014, and drops to no less than 90 percent after 2016.\n\nThe delay will cost Pennsylvania hundreds of millions if not billions in Medicaid dollars this year and leaves an estimated 500,000 low income residents without health coverage for the first year of the program.\n\nEarly reaction to the proposal from the health-care community seemed to fall into two camps.\n\nPolicy analysts and advocates for the poor said that the plan, while improved, still went further than what any other state has sought.
