The agency pegged the cost at up to $600 million, including as much as $350 million in construction costs, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nRelated: Obama Readies Biggest Reach of Presidential Power Yet\n\nThe price was too high for President Obama, who pledged to close the prison during the 2008 election. He rejected the scheme in a November 10 meeting with Defense Secretary Ash Carter and ordered the Pentagon to rework its plan, including finding ways to cut operating costs.\n\nThe detention site costs $400 million to operate each year. A U.S.-based facility would likely cost less than $300 million annually after initial costs, a defense official told the Journal.\n\nThere are 107 detainees at Guantanamo today. Of those, 48 have been deemed eligible to transfer to other countries.\n\nDespite his campaign promise, and signing an executive order to close Guantanamo on his second day in office, Obama\u2019s attempts to close the prison have been routinely thwarted by congressional lawmakers, Democrats and Republicans alike.\n\nThe latest obstacle was put in place last week when the president signed the $607 billion defense policy bill into law. The measure contained several prohibitions related to the detention facility, including a ban on transferring prisoners to U.S. soil.\n\nRelated: Obama Stumbles Again on Gitmo Closure Plan\n\nThe administration has long argued that closing the site is a cost-saving measure and would rob extremist groups like ISIS of a major recruiting tool.\n\nLast week White House press secretary Josh Earnest said keeping the facility open is \u201cnot an efficient or effective use of taxpayer dollars when you consider the alternatives that are available.\u201d\n\nAny plan that costs anywhere close to the one rejected by the president is a guaranteed non-starter on Capitol Hill.\n\nWary lawmakers would simply point to the upfront expense of closing the prison to throw out any proposed Pentagon scheme.\n\nRelated: Obama Says Russia Wants Out of Syria. Putin says, \u2018Nyet\u2019\n\nEven though a U.S.-based site might wind up costing hundreds of millions less, Congress has stubbornly refused to take the long view when it comes to potential savings and national security.\n\nThe politics and costs surround Guantanamo could push Obama closer to taking executive action on the facility, something he hinted at in a statement accompanying his signature of the fiscal 2016 defense blueprint.\n\n\u201cUnder certain circumstances, the provisions in this bill concerning detainee transfers would violate constitutional separation of powers principles,\u201d the president said.\n\nA unilateral move to close the prison could set off a long and costly court fight with Congress.\n\nA top Republican lawmaker signaled the kind of opposition Obama is likely to face.\n\n\u201cThe President and his supporters have argued for years that closing GTMO will make us safer and it will save us money. No one really believes that bringing terrorists to our shores would make Americans any safer. Now we know that the President\u2019s claims of saving us money aren\u2019t true either,\u201d House Armed Services Committee chair Mac Thornberry (TX) said in a statement.\n\nHe said Obama was \u201cright to reject the plan on the basis of cost, but he was absolutely wrong to direct the Pentagon to cut corners and bring him a cheaper option. If the President is determined to bring these terrorists to the United States, he can\u2019t do it with cut-rate security. He owes the troops who would guard these detainees, not to mention the Americans who suddenly find al Qaeda terrorists held in their backyards, far more.\u201c", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "There\u2019s a ballpark dollar figure for how much it might cost the Defense Department to shutter and replace the U.S. detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and unless the agency can dramatically reduce the price tag, any attempt to close the controversial site is likely to be dead on arrival with Capitol Hill and the White House.", "title": "Why President Obama Rejected the Pentagon\u2019s Plan to Close Gitmo", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/02/Why-President-Obama-Rejected-Pentagon-s-Plan-Close-Gitmo", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/05022013_Guantanamo_Prisoner_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/02/Why-President-Obama-Rejected-Pentagon-s-Plan-Close-Gitmo", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/05022013_Guantanamo_Prisoner_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "There\u2019s a ballpark dollar figure for how much it might cost the Defense Department to shutter and replace the U.S. detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and unless the agency can dramatically reduce the price tag, any attempt to close the controversial site is likely to be dead on arrival with Capitol Hill and the White House.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Last month the Obama administration rejected a long-awaited Pentagon plan to close the U.S. detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.\nRelated: Obama Readies Biggest Reach of Presidential Power YetThe price was too high for President Obama, who pledged to close the prison during the 2008 election.\nDespite his campaign promise, and signing an executive order to close Guantanamo on his second day in office, Obama\u2019s attempts to close the prison have been routinely thwarted by congressional lawmakers, Democrats and Republicans alike.\nA unilateral move to close the prison could set off a long and costly court fight with Congress.\nIf the President is determined to bring these terrorists to the United States, he can\u2019t do it with cut-rate security."}
