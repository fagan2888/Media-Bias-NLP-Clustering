LANSING, MI — Michigan Republican Gov. Rick Snyder has been named one of nine “public officials of the year” for 2014 by Governing magazine.

The annual list, which highlights elected or appointed officials in state and local governments, includes a mixture of Democrats and Republicans from around the country.

Snyder, fresh of his hard fought re-election win over challenger Mark Schauer, was praised for bringing “risk-taking and performance management” to the governor’s office.

“Most elected officials abhor risk. They run from it,” Snyder said in an honoree profile. “But if everything we did worked, that means we’re not taking risks.”

The magazine highlighted several instances where Snyder “stuck his neck out” to support potentially controversial policies, including Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act, right to work and state aid for a Detroit bankruptcy settlement.

Other 2014 honorees included Georgia House Minority Leader Stacey Abrams and Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter. Former Michigan Budget Director John Nixon, appointed by Snyder, was honored in 2012.

"Especially when the federal government is plagued by partisan fighting and gridlock, these dedicated individuals have shown that real change is possible,” Governing executive director Zach Patton said in a statement.
