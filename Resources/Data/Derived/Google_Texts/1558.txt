The victory that eluded the Station Camp High football team for the first two games of the season was finally achieved on Friday night with a convincing 34-14 win over visiting Antioch.

“We need to work on capitalizing on opportunities better,” Bison head coach Shaun Hollinsworth said. “We have a lot of ball left to play.”

After a quick three-and-out series by Antioch, the Bisons mounted a nine-play drive that covered 51 yards. It was capped off by an 11-yard quarterback sneak by senior Kyle Anderton.

It marked the first of three touchdown runs by Anderton.

“Our O-line (offensive line) stepped up big time for us,” Anderton said. “We didn’t have to pass much, because our ground game succeeded.”

The Bears’ counterattack ended when Bison senior Jacob Norman recovered a fumble by Bears’ quarterback Raekwon Hosey.

It was through the air that Anderton garnered the Bisons’ second score of the night, hooking up with junior wide receiver Kage Hancock in the end zone for a 3-yard touchdown. Shaw’s point-after touchdown (PAT) kick was good, making the score 14-0 with 5:03 left in the first quarter.

The Bisons had 12 first downs to the Bears’ six in the first half.

There were three turnovers between the opponents in the second quarter. Anderton threw an interception to Antioch defensive back Michael Bailey. Station Camp senior Griffin Hammond picked up a Bear fumble, directly followed by Antioch doing the same.

With 1:07 left in the half, the Bison opted to punt on fourth down, in hopes of pinning Antioch deep with little time. Unfortunately, punter Walt Heatherly’s attempt was blocked, leaving Antioch with possession on the Bison 39 yard line.

With six seconds left on the clock, Antioch scored on Hosey’s 36-yard touchdown pass to Michael Bailey. Placekicker Erick Aguilar split the uprights for a 14-7 score at the half.

Station Camp (1-2) came out firing on all cylinders in the third quarter. Along with Anderton, senior tailback Josh Gilley played a vital factor in the Bison running game. The duo managed a total 36 yards on the first drive out of the half, with Anderton capping it off with a 1-yard sneak. Shaw’s kick was good, creating a 21-7 margin.

“Watching film, we found holes in their (Antioch’s) defense,” Gilley said. “We had a good week of practice, which helped us bring things together.”

Gilley rushed for 134 yards on 23 attempts. Anderton finished with 80 yards on 20 attempts.

“They are the heart and soul of our offense,” Hollinsworth said.

After two more possessions failed to reach the end zone and effectively seal the game, Station Camp’s defense came to the rescue. Bison junior Payton Anderton batted down two passes, in addition to recording numerous tackles.

“I expected to play hard on our home turf,” Payton Anderton said. “We played our best game of the year tonight.”

The fourth quarter saw two more scores from Station Camp. The first was a 1-yard run from Kyle Anderton, and the second was Gilley’s 3-yard touchdown dash to extend the lead to 27 points with less than six minutes remaining.

Antioch’s KaDarius Hyde had a 61-yard scamper that subsequently set up his 3-yard touchdown run to cap the scoring.

The Bears fell to 0-4.

The Bison resume District 9-AAA play by hosting Lebanon on Friday.
