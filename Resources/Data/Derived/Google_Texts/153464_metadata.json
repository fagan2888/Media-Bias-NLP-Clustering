The top Republican in the Senate on Sunday said that he has been pleased to find a number of areas where the Republican-controlled Congress, or at least the Senate, can work with a Democratic administration. However, he said, future battles are inevitable.\n\nIn an appearance on ABC\u2019s This Week Sunday morning, McConnell promised that a bill giving President Obama Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) \u2013 that is, the ability to bring an international trade deal to the floor of both houses of Congress for an up-or-down vote -- will pass the Senate, and quickly.\n\nRelated: GOP Hopefuls Reveal Major Line of Attack against Clinton\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll pass it. We\u2019ll pass it later this week,\u201d McConnell told host George Stephanopolous. \u201cThe president has done an excellent job on this.\u201d\n\nThe TPA bill has been a flashpoint for members of Congress on both sides of the aisle. Many Democrats are adamantly opposed to it because it would allow the president to bring the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal up for a vote without an opportunity for lawmakers to amend it. They are concerned about what they see as a lack of worker protections, environmental safeguards and defense against countries that engage in currency manipulation.\n\nSome Republicans are also reluctant to approve TPA, though for different reasons.\n\n\u201cI point out to my members who are somewhat squeamish, as you can imagine, [about] giving the president power on any issue, given his expansive view of his powers on so many other issues\u2026this is a trade promotion authority not just for president Obama but for the next president as well,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cThis is a six-year trade promotion authority bill that will give the next president an opportunity to enter into trade agreements with other countries around the world.\u201d\n\nRelated: Economy Is Voters\u2019 Top Worry: A Break for Rick Perry?\n\nPassage of TPA is seen by the administration as essential to securing an acceptable deal in the ongoing TPP talks, because the assumption is that the other countries participating in the negotiations will be hesitant to make their best offers if they think the U.S. Congress will be allowed to tinker with the deal after it has been struck by negotiators.\n\nMcConnell said TPA is important to the country for reasons that go beyond trade.\n\n\u201cWe know America is a big winner when we lower barriers to our products abroad,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, he added, \u201c[TPP] also has a foreign policy and defense component. A lot of the countries in Asia are a little apprehensive, as you can imagine, about Chinese economic domination, but also potential Chinese military domination. So they would like to get closer to us, and this is a great opportunity to do that as well as to benefit America and create new jobs here.\u201d\n\nRelated: Hillary Clinton Vows to Overturn the Law That\u2019s Raising Big Bucks for Her Campaign\n\nBeyond trade, McConnell pointed out that the Senate has been, in his words, \u201cgetting back to work.\u201d The chamber has passed a bill giving Congress a certain amount of oversight over the ongoing talks with Iran about its nuclear program. There are also bills on cyber security and education in the pipeline.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to focus on the things that we can agree on to make progress for the country, even though we know there are many things [on which] we do not agree with the president,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cAll of those will probably come to the fore in spending bills. We want to spend more on defense; they want to spend more on everything.\u201d\n\nPressed by Stephanopolous about his relationship with the president and whether there would be a \u201cbourbon summit\u201d \u2013 a reference to a passing comment the president made about inviting McConnell to the White House for a glass of Kentucky\u2019s finest \u2013 McConnell reiterated a point he has made a number of times in the past.\n\nHe would be happy to have a glass of bourbon with the president, he said, but getting along with Obama has never been a problem for him.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have a personality problem,\u201d McConnell said. They just disagree on how to run the country.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Trade Promotion Authority will strengthen American trade with Asia, the Senate Majority Leader says, but also help offset China\u2019s economic and military might in the region.", "title": "McConnell Says TPA Will Counter Chinese Dominance", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/05/18/McConnell-Says-TPA-Will-Counter-Chinese-Dominance", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/Mitch%20McConnell.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/05/18/McConnell-Says-TPA-Will-Counter-Chinese-Dominance", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/Mitch%20McConnell.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Trade Promotion Authority will strengthen American trade with Asia, the Senate Majority Leader says, but also help offset China\u2019s economic and military might in the region.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThe president has done an excellent job on this.\u201dThe TPA bill has been a flashpoint for members of Congress on both sides of the aisle.\nMcConnell said TPA is important to the country for reasons that go beyond trade.\nA lot of the countries in Asia are a little apprehensive, as you can imagine, about Chinese economic domination, but also potential Chinese military domination.\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to focus on the things that we can agree on to make progress for the country, even though we know there are many things [on which] we do not agree with the president,\u201d McConnell said.\nMany Democrats are adamantly opposed to it because it would allow the president to bring the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal up for a vote without an opportunity for lawmakers to amend it."}
