Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco it is too soon to give up on the public health exchange market created by the Affordable Care Act, Reuters reported.\n\nAfter losing in the mid-single-digits in exchange segment in 2015, Aetna has priced its exchanges to attain mid-single-digit growth this year.\n\nBertolini said the company has spent more money on accountable care organizations than it\u2019s lost in the exchanges.\n\nInsight:\n\nBertolini said Aetna\u2019s goal of mid-single digits with the exchanges in 2016 may not be fully achievable, but he expects them to make some headway.\n\nEfforts to improve performance include investing more in medical management, utilizing better calculation of risk-adjusted scores in the exchange populations, and withdrawing from the Kansas market, Bertolini said.\n\n\u201cWe believe it is incredibly important, in the business we\u2019re in, that we insure all Americans,\u201d Bertolini said in a webcast. \u201cWe believe we have an obligation to stick it out and work with it until we know that it won\u2019t work. And I believe it is too early to give up on this process.\u201d\n\nStrategically, Aetna has been prudent about the risks it\u2019s willing to take, the products it offers and how they are priced in the exchange market, Bertolini said. \u201cBecause...we get paid for the risk we\u2019re assuming, we should be willing to take it.\u201d\n\nBertolini\u2019s commitment to developing Aetna\u2019s exchanges should be reassuring to proponents of Obamacare. In November 2015, UnitedHealth Group said low enrollment and high costs associated with its exchanges could lead it to exit the marketplace in 2017, according to Reuters.\n\nRecommended Reading\n\nReuters: Aetna CEO says he is not giving up on public insurance exchanges\n\nBloomberg Business: Anthem, Aetna Lead Health Insurer Rally on 2016 Forecasts", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Meg Bryant", "twitter": {"domain": "Healthcare Dive", "site": "@healthcaredive", "card": "summary"}, "featured": "False", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/cache/75/af/75af026eae6cc17bc3f847d10eecd0b9.jpg", "sailthru.tags": "healthcare,type-newspost,healthcare-payer,healthcare-finance", "news_keywords": "Payer,Finance", "category": "News Post", "title": "Aetna's Bertolini vows to stay the course on ACA exchanges", "pub_date": "jan 14, 2016", "section": "news", "sailthru.date": "2016-01-14T09:00:00", "content_boost": 4, "touched": "True", "article_date_original": "Thursday, January 14, 2016, 09:00 AM", "medium": "news", "description": "Healthcare", "sailthru.expire_date": "2026-01-01T09:00:00", "teaser": "<p>Aetna&rsquo;s public health exchanges account for 5% of total membership and 6% of operating revenues &mdash; hardly enough to &ldquo;break the bank,&rdquo; CEO Mark Bertolini said.</p>", "sponsored": "False", "date": "2016-01-14", "sailthru.description": "Aetna\u2019s public health exchanges account for 5% of total membership and 6% of operating revenues \u2014 hardly enough to \u201cbreak the bank,\u201d CEO Mark Bertolini said.", "viewport": "width=986", "og": {"site_name": "Healthcare Dive", "description": "Aetna\u2019s public health exchanges account for 5% of total membership and 6% of operating revenues \u2014 hardly enough to \u201cbreak the bank,\u201d CEO Mark Bertolini said.", "title": "Aetna's Bertolini vows to stay the course on ACA exchanges", "url": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/news/aetnas-bertolini-vows-to-stay-the-course-on-aca-exchanges/412090/", "image": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/diveimage/8009785440_d671748acd_b.jpg", "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "aN-77CvDv8Rt4OQnHMaUSm6V87TF8ri5GDUv93p7pHk", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/cache/90/c1/90c1dc06c6dcaf2066abee6164facf3c.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd27d9\"", "article_summary": "After losing in the mid-single-digits in exchange segment in 2015, Aetna has priced its exchanges to attain mid-single-digit growth this year.\nBertolini said the company has spent more money on accountable care organizations than it\u2019s lost in the exchanges.\nEfforts to improve performance include investing more in medical management, utilizing better calculation of risk-adjusted scores in the exchange populations, and withdrawing from the Kansas market, Bertolini said.\n\u201cWe believe it is incredibly important, in the business we\u2019re in, that we insure all Americans,\u201d Bertolini said in a webcast.\nInsight:Bertolini said Aetna\u2019s goal of mid-single digits with the exchanges in 2016 may not be fully achievable, but he expects them to make some headway."}
