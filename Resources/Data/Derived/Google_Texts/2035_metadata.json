Alex Mooney, R-W.Va., attended his first Kanawha County Commission meeting since being elected to Congress. Carper said Mooney talked told the commission about some of his priority items about economic development and a bill that he has proposed to assist physicians by paying them under the Affordable Care Act. Mooney left after five minutes to attend the Donald Trump rally at the Civic Center.\n\nA resident named Joe Stern presented a petition to the Commission to get a law allowing hunting on park grounds on Sundays on the general election ballot.\n\nCarper decided to send the petition to the planning committee and county clerk so that the next steps could be taken.\n\nThe Elk Public Service District will apply for a grant to receive $1.5 million to extend its service to people in Blue Creek/Rt. 119, Young\u2019s Bottom and Reamer.\n\nReach Daniel Desrochers at dan.desrochers@wvgazettemail.com, 304-348-4886 or follow @drdesrochers on Twitter.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Charleston Gazette-Mail", "title": "Mitch Vingle: Examining the state\u2019s D-I baseball crop", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.wvgazettemail.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CH/20160524/GZ020401/160529757/AR/0/AR-160529757.jpg", "url": "http://www.wvgazettemail.com/sports-mitch-vingle/20160524/mitch-vingle-examining-the-states-d-i-baseball-crop", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Charleston Gazette-Mail", "description": "See attached", "creator": "@wvgazettemail", "image": {"src": "http://www.wvgazettemail.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CH/20160524/GZ020401/160529757/AR/0/AR-160529757.jpg"}, "title": "Mitch Vingle: Examining the state\u2019s D-I baseball crop", "site": "@wvgazettemail", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "google-site-verification": "1bw05nOwAmeGwNrWfrMp361tiStYbQbOwqqj_P_-LVA", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/charlestongazettemail"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "dc.title": "Mitch Vingle: Examining the state\u2019s D-I baseball crop"}, "article_summary": "\u201cIt\u2019s an unusual mission in that it does community development and economic development,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I hear things from other parts of the county,\u201d Carper said.\nKanawha County Commission President Kent Carper challenged Charleston Area Alliance President and CEO Matt Ballard on why the Charleston Area Alliance doesn\u2019t do more community development.\nRep.
