Although the most consequential of Obama\u2019s lies \u2014 it got him re-elected \u2014 it\u2019s far from his only prevarication.\n\nI\u2019ve counted 75 significant lies since his campaign for president began, but that doesn\u2019t begin to tally the casual fibs and hyperbole he spouts seemingly every day. Here are five that illustrate just how much Obama\u2019s presidency is built on falsehoods.\n\n5. \u201cMy father left my family when I was 2 years old.\u201d\n\n\n\nObama made this claim in September 2009, when addressing the nation\u2019s schoolkids. By then, the blogosphere knew that baby Obama had never spent a night under the same roof as his father, let alone two years.\n\nFor years, Obama and his advisers invested enormous political capital in what biographer David Remnick called Obama\u2019s \u201csignature appeal: the use of the details of his own life as a reflection of a kind of multicultural ideal.\u201d\n\nRemnick called Obama\u2019s autobiography \u201ca mixture of verifiable fact, recollection, recreation, invention and artful shaping.\u201d In other words, the truth is never good enough.\n\n4. \u201cThe Fast and Furious program was a field-initiated program begun under the previous administration.\u201d\n\n\n\nObama spun this fiction at a September 2012 Univision forum knowing it was false. In fact, the bizarre, deadly idea to let American guns \u201cwalk\u201d into Mexico, where they were used by drug cartels to kill dozens, began in October 2009.\n\nThree months earlier, White House press secretary Jay Carney had made the same bogus claim virtually word for word at a press conference and got shot down on national TV. \u201cIt began in fall 2009,\u201d corrected White House correspondent Jake Tapper, then with ABC.\n\nCarney refused to acknowledge he lied, and the president continued to lie weeks later. It\u2019s all part of Obama\u2019s ducking of responsibility \u2014 it\u2019s always someone else\u2019s fault.\n\n3. \u201cNot even a smidgen of corruption.\u201d\n\n\n\nObama said this in response to Bill O\u2019Reilly\u2019s question about the IRS scandal: \u201cYou\u2019re saying no corruption?\u201d\n\nIf there were not even a \u201csmidgen of corruption,\u201d as Obama insisted, it is hard to understand what outraged him, or at least seemed to, when news of the IRS scandal first broke. \u201cIt\u2019s inexcusable, and Americans are right to be angry about it, and I am angry about it,\u201d Obama said in May 2013. Obama routinely expressed anger when some new scandal erupted on his watch \u2014 IRS, the failed ObamaCare website, the VA scandal, Fast and Furious \u2014 but never before had he shoved a scandal down the memory hole so quickly.\n\nAnd how could Obama know there wasn\u2019t a smidgen of corruption before the investigation was even over? Perhaps because the administration knew that any proof of that was gone with deleted emails and destroyed hard drives?\n\n2. \u201cWe revealed to the American people exactly what we understood at the time.\u201d\n\n\n\nDuring that same Super Bowl Sunday interview, Obama made this claim in response to O\u2019Reilly\u2019s inquiry about the attack on the American consulate in Benghazi. Obama continued to dissemble: \u201cThe notion that we would hide the ball for political purposes when a week later we all said, in fact, there was a terrorist attack taking place and the day after I said it was an act of terror, that wouldn\u2019t be a very good coverup.\u201d\n\nIn fact, it was exactly a week after the attack, on Sept. 18, that Obama took his first questions about Benghazi. Bizarrely, he did so to David Letterman. \u201cHere\u2019s what happened,\u201d Obama said.\n\n\u201cYou had a video that was released by somebody who lives here, sort of a shadowy character who \u2014 who made an extremely offensive video directed at \u2014 at Mohammed and Islam.\u201d\n\nWe know now that the administration knew this wasn\u2019t true. Not a week later; not even the very night of the attacks.\n\nOn many levels, this was Obama\u2019s most telling lie. He only deals with the world as he sees it, not as it is.\n\n1. \u201cTransparency and the rule of law will be the touchstones of this presidency.\u201d\n\n\n\nObama told this whopper to his assembled staff on his first day in office. He promised it to the press. Instead, his administration refuses to hand over documents and Obama refuses to answer questions. As liberal constitutional scholar Jonathan Turley assessed the presidency, \u201cBarack Obama is really the president Richard Nixon always wanted to be.\u201d\n\nWhat do these lies, just a sample of many, tell us? Obama never stopped \u201cartfully shaping\u201d his life.\n\nThe scary thing is he might actually believe these lies. He believes that posting a shot from his personal photographer online is \u201ctransparent.\u201d That targeting conservative groups for audits isn\u2019t corrupt. That everything that has gone wrong with his presidency is Bush\u2019s fault.\n\nKnowing that, how can we believe anything that he says?\n\nJack Cashill is the author of \u201cYou Lie!
