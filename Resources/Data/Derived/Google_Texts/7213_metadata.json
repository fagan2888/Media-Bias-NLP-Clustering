Richards has served as president of Planned Parenthood since 2006, and in that time, she has worked to promote sex education and maintain access to preventive care throughout health care system upheavals.\n\nOn Sept. 11, Richards will help Planned Parenthood of Southwest Oregon celebrate its educational achievements and will discuss the future of well-crafted sex ed programs in Oregon. The fundraising dinner is 6 pm at the Hilton Eugene and Conference Center, and tickets can be purchased at wkly.ws/1ji.\n\nWhat do you think is the most pressing issue facing reproductive health care in this country?\n\nAccess to reproductive health care is a major issue for millions of women across America. There are still vast parts of the country where people don\u2019t have access to quality reproductive health care and often have alarming health outcomes as a result. In many counties in many states, there is not a single OB/GYN provider available. As if that isn\u2019t bad enough, politicians across the country are trying to pass laws that would cut off access to women\u2019s health care and, in the process, close health centers that women rely on for lifesaving cancer screenings, preventive care and birth control. These laws have a devastating impact on women who already have the least access to health care.\n\nIs the Affordable Care Act a step in the right direction when it comes to providing reproductive health care?\n\nThe Affordable Care Act is the single biggest advancement in women\u2019s health in a generation and is already making a big difference in the lives of women across the country. For the first time, women of all walks of life are starting to get both birth control and important well-woman checkups at no cost.\n\nAnd starting Oct. 1, nearly 12 million uninsured women of reproductive age will become newly eligible for affordable health insurance coverage. These plans cover things that are important to women, including birth control and well-woman visits at no cost, as well as doctor visits, hospitalizations, maternity care, ER care and other prescriptions.\n\nLike always, Planned Parenthood is here to help \u2014 go to PlannedParenthood.org/HealthInsurance for more information about how to enroll.\n\nHow do you think Wendy Davis\u2019 stand in Texas brought greater attention to the issues of women\u2019s health care nationwide?\n\nWendy Davis and the thousands of Texans who stood with her lit the fuse in Austin \u2014 and it is catching all over the country. People don\u2019t want politicians making women\u2019s private medical decisions, cutting off access to lifesaving preventive care or safe and legal abortion \u2014 and they absolutely will not stand for it. In the first minutes of the citizens\u2019 filibuster down in Texas, something started that can\u2019t be stopped. And now, spurred on by the good people of Texas and beyond, folks all over the country are standing up to attacks on women\u2019s health, saying once and for all: Enough is enough. They\u2019re calling it \u201cpulling a Wendy Davis.\u201d\n\nHow far have we come in terms of sex education in our public schools, and what is the biggest challenge facing sex education?\n\nSex education has come a long way over the past 20 years. Over 100 studies have shown that comprehensive sex education helps young people delay sex and use condoms and contraception when they do become sexually active, so we\u2019ve made tremendous progress in developing programs that have been proven to work. And parents, who are talking with their kids about sex more than ever, have made it clear that they support comprehensive sex education in middle and high schools. Also, thanks to the Obama administration, the federal government began funding evidence-based teen pregnancy prevention programs for the first time in 2010, instead of continuing to fund failed abstinence-only programs. That funding has enabled schools and organizations like Planned Parenthood to reach many more teens with effective programs.\n\nOregon is a shining star in this regard. In the previous decade, Planned Parenthood of Southwestern Oregon launched an initiative known as the New 3Rs (Rights, Respect, Responsibility). This statewide work was the primary catalyst for the state of Oregon\u2019s work shifting its focus from pregnancy prevention to focusing on the promotion of adolescent sexual health. Another way to say that is, Oregon is promoting youth sexual health as opposed to preventing sexual health crises. It is a much longer-term strategy to foster health rather than treat sickness.\n\nIn terms of challenges, I hear from our Planned Parenthood affiliates all the time that the biggest challenge facing sex education is the lack of money for education. It\u2019s hard to believe that our country still provides funding for abstinence-only programs even though research and experience have shown it to be totally ineffective. We need philanthropists to step up and joyfully fund comprehensive sex education so our youth have the tools they need. And healthy sexuality education has always been part of Planned Parenthood\u2019s preventive health care. There should be a big education component in our health care going forward. People make better decisions when they have accurate information.\n\nWe are also constantly trying to find new and better ways to reach young people through technology \u2014 on our websites and social media properties, through apps and widgets \u2014 but there\u2019s just so much information available right now that getting them the information they need in a relevant way remains a challenge. Over the past several years, Planned Parenthood has been committed to reaching young people where they are \u2014 online and on their phones \u2014 and we need to continue to innovate and find ways to adapt the approaches that we know work in classrooms to a digital environment.\n\nCurrently, how well does sex ed include kids who identify as LGBTQ?\n\nThis is a really important question, as young people who identify as LGBTQ experience huge disparities in their sexual health, including high rates of STDs. Planned Parenthood strives to ensure that all our sex ed programs are nonjudgmental and inclusive of all youth, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity. Many Planned Parenthood affiliates around the country have programs for LGBTQ youth and allies that provide safe and supportive environments that allow young people to get the information and support they need to make healthy decisions. With that said, we definitely need to continue to strive as a field to improve our programs so that they are responsive to the needs of all young people.\n\nPPSO teaches to the Oregon benchmarks and standards which are inclusive of all youth. Talking about sexual health is so important because sexual health is inclusive. Reproductive health may not be inclusive. So Oregon is a leader in this regard with its Oregon Equality Act.\n\nCan you speak to how Oregon\u2019s sex ed plan compare to other states, and if there is room for improvement?\n\nOregon has been a true leader when it comes to sex education. While many other states have cut sex education funding or pushed abstinence-only programs, Oregon state policy mandates comprehensive sex education in middle and high school. What\u2019s more, the state adopted a Youth Sexual Health Plan to ensure that the promises of the policy are borne out, a full three years before the nation announced a similar plan.\n\nPlanned Parenthood of Southwest Oregon\u2019s New 3 Rs is the catalyst that got the Governor involved and all state agencies working with the affiliate that culminated in Oregon\u2019s Youth Sexual Health Plan. That was the result of strong partnerships and commitment to young people\u2019s wellbeing on the part of state and local officials, community partners, and advocates. It would be wonderful to see the state of Oregon share outcomes from this work so that other states and communities can learn from the experience here and so that Oregon can serve as a model for those wanting to adopt a more proactive approach to youth sexual health.", "article_metadata": {"revisit-after": "1 day", "description": "As kids gear up for another school year, sex education probably isn\u2019t the first thing on everyone\u2019s minds, but perhaps Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards\u2019 upcoming visit to Eugene can serve as a reminder that learning about sex in an informative, helpful way is still an integral part of our school system."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9948\"", "article_summary": "Talking about sexual health is so important because sexual health is inclusive.\nThey\u2019re calling it \u201cpulling a Wendy Davis.\u201dHow far have we come in terms of sex education in our public schools, and what is the biggest challenge facing sex education?\nLike always, Planned Parenthood is here to help \u2014 go to PlannedParenthood.org/HealthInsurance for more information about how to enroll.\nAnother way to say that is, Oregon is promoting youth sexual health as opposed to preventing sexual health crises.\nIs the Affordable Care Act a step in the right direction when it comes to providing reproductive health care?"}
