CLEVELAND, Ohio -- More than 202,000 Ohioans have signed up for private insurance under the Affordable Care Act as of Jan. 30, according to the latest preliminary data released Wednesday by the Obama administration.

Along with the 471,000 Ohioans who have benefited from expanded Medicaid program that went into effect in January 2014, the number of uninsured Ohioans has nearly been cut in half, with roughly 600,000 uninsured adults remaining.
