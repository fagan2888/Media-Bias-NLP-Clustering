He majored in a growing field like health care. He studied hard and took time to develop relationships with his professors. Most important, he obtained a great internship the summer before his senior year.\n\nBut more than seven months after receiving his diploma from Oakwood University, a historically black religious school in Huntsville, Ala., Zonicle is still without a job in his field. Instead, he is working part time for $7.60 an hour at a Barnes & Noble bookstore in the center of town.\n\n\u201cIt was tougher than I expected,\u201d said Zonicle, 23, who applied for jobs at hospitals and nursing homes from Ohio to Florida after graduating in May. \u201cBecause of the work I had put in as an undergraduate, and making connections, I thought it would be easier to find a decent position.\u201d\n\nCollege graduates have survived both the recession and the ho-hum recovery far better than those without a degree, but blacks who finished four years of college are suffering from unemployment at rates that are painfully higher than those of their white counterparts.\n\nAmong recent graduates ages 22 to 27, the jobless rate last year was 12.4 percent for blacks, vs. 4.9 percent for whites, said John Schmitt, a senior economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research.\n\nGrowing gap\n\nWhile there has always been a gap between black and white college grads, this 7.5 percentage-point difference was far greater than before the recession. In 2007, there was only a 1.4 percentage-point difference, with 4.6 percent of recent black graduates out of work compared with 3.2 percent of similarly educated whites.\n\n\u201cThis is very different from the past,\u201d said Schmitt, co-author of a study of employment among recent graduates. \u201cYou\u2019d have to go back to the early 1980s recession to see that pattern.\u201d\n\nHistorically, the periods during and immediately after downturns have been harder on blacks than on whites. But in this current cycle, the trend has been even more extreme.\n\nYounger workers absorbed the brunt of job losses during the Great Recession, so black college graduates, also subject to persistent racial discrimination despite advances in civil rights, suffered from a double disadvantage, the report concluded.\n\nAlthough the numbers of whites, blacks and Latinos graduating from college have surged in recent years, the number of black graduates is still relatively small. Of the 1.9 million college graduates ages 22 to 27 who were unemployed in 2013, 57,000 were black.\n\nUnderemployed\n\nPoliticians, economists and business leaders are united in the view that despite staggering tuition and fees at many institutions, college is worth the cost.\n\nAnd it still is, despite the significant hit college graduates have taken in recent years. Particularly when considering the alternatives.\n\nThe unemployment rate for college graduates in November, for example, was down to 3.2 percent, compared with 5.6 percent for those with a high school diploma and 8.5 percent among those with less education. College graduates earned roughly twice as much last year as those without a degree.\n\nWith his part-time low-wage job at Barnes & Noble, Zonicle can now count himself among the 56 percent of recent black college graduates who are considered underemployed, or working in jobs that don\u2019t require a degree.\n\n\u201cI had disappointing times before,\u201d Zonicle said, \u201cbut when you\u2019re expecting and hoping for something to come through and it doesn\u2019t, it\u2019s hard.\u201d\n\nPatricia Cohen,\n\nThe New York Times", "article_metadata": {"description": "Blacks who finished four years of college are suffering from unemployment at rates that are painfully higher than those of their white counterparts.", "og": {"description": "Blacks who finished four years of college are suffering from unemployment at rates that are painfully higher than those of their white counterparts.", "title": "Good jobs elusive for black college graduates", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20141225-good-jobs-elusive-for-black-college-graduates.ece", "image": {"width": 670, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20141225-grads_employment_race.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/GRADS_EMPLOYMENT_RACE.jpg", "height": 474}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2014-12-26T03:33:55Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2014-12-26T03:28:56Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Good jobs elusive for black college graduates\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20141225-good-jobs-elusive-for-black-college-graduates.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20141225-grads_employment_race.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/GRADS_EMPLOYMENT_RACE.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"2109792\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-12-26T03:28:56Z\", \"section\": \"Economy & You Headlines\", \"author\": \"From Wire Reports\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20141225-grads_employment_race.jpg.ece/ALTERNATES/w660/GRADS_EMPLOYMENT_RACE.jpg", "publishtime": "2014-12-26T03:28:56Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "article_summary": "Of the 1.9 million college graduates ages 22 to 27 who were unemployed in 2013, 57,000 were black.\nCollege graduates earned roughly twice as much last year as those without a degree.\nAlthough the numbers of whites, blacks and Latinos graduating from college have surged in recent years, the number of black graduates is still relatively small.\n\u201cThis is very different from the past,\u201d said Schmitt, co-author of a study of employment among recent graduates.\nWith his part-time low-wage job at Barnes & Noble, Zonicle can now count himself among the 56 percent of recent black college graduates who are considered underemployed, or working in jobs that don\u2019t require a degree."}
