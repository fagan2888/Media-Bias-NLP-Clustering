The Utah Department of Health is again making a case for Utahns to get screened for colorectal cancer with its campaign through March.

The daughter of the late TV personality and outdoorsman Doug Miller is leading the effort.

“And if you won’t get a colonoscopy for yourself, get one for you family.”

Karen Coleman’s TV and radio message is simple. She says her dad was only 58 when he died of colon cancer and if he had gotten screened, he would still be here. Brenda Nelson is a health specialist with the Utah Cancer Control Program. She says the number of Utahns getting an exam is going up.

“Fortunately, we’re above the national average,” says Nelson, “But we’re at 70% so we still have some work to do.”

Nelson says 92% of colorectal cancers are treatable when detected early. She says there are very few reasons to avoid being test.

“With the Affordable Care Act,” says Nelson, “it’s now covered under preventative service so there are a lot of people out there that have insurance that are still not getting their colonoscopies done at age 50.”

Nelson says even those without insurance may qualify for free testing through the Utah Cancer Control Program. She says to find out if you qualify call 1-800-717-1811.
