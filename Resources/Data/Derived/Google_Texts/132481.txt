FORT COLLINS — Josh Scott made sure his last game against his in-state rival was a winning one.

Scott had 21 points and 11 rebounds and Colorado rallied past Colorado State 88-77 on Sunday.

It was the fourth double-double of the season for the senior and it made up for last year’s 62-60 home loss to the Rams. Scott missed all seven of his field goals that night and finished with just two points.

“It means a lot to win against CSU,” said Scott, who has 27 double-doubles in his career. “Last year we didn’t have a very good taste in our mouth when they beat us at our house and this year we come out with a win. I’m really happy.”

Wesley Gordon scored a season-high 15 points with 12 rebounds and three blocks for Colorado, which outscored the Rams 49-25 after intermission to win its seventh in a row.

“When two bigs have double-doubles, with the perimeter firepower we have on this team, that’s what makes this team special,” Colorado coach Tad Boyle said.

Colorado (7-1) trailed by 13 at halftime but used a 15-1 run at the start of the second to take a 54-53 lead. The Buffaloes extended it to six but a pair of 3s by Antwan Scott got the Rams within 64-62.

The game was tied at 68 when Josh Scott hit a layup and Gordon two free throws to put Colorado ahead 72-68. After two free throws by the Rams, Scott hit another jumper and Josh Fortune converted a 3-point play to make it 77-70 with 3:45 left.

Scott hit another shot in the lane, Gordon sank two free throws and Dominique Collier’s layup with 1:44 left made it 83-72.

Gian Clavell led Colorado State with 18 points and John Gillon had 16 points, all in the first half. The Rams (5-3) have lost three straight.

“This is the most frustrating game I’ve coached,” Colorado State’s Larry Eustachy said. “You saw the team we are in the first half and just the opposite in the second half.”

Colorado went on a first-half scoring drought of 4 minutes, 14 seconds and saw a 12-5 lead turn into a 25-18 deficit. The Buffaloes missed 11 straight field goals over a span of 9:06 while Colorado State found its rhythm. The Rams were 7 of 10 from 3-point range in the first half and hit 59.4 percent from the field to take a 52-39 lead at halftime.

Gordon hit two 3-pointers at the start of the second half to pull the Buffaloes within three. They were his first two of the season and the only one in the second half for Colorado.

“I felt comfortable after that (first) jumper,” Gordon said.

Gordon, who is averaging 10.4 rebounds in the last five games, has given Colorado another presence on the block.

“He has the ability to make us go from a good team to a great team,” Josh Scott said. “Wes is super talented and it’s what he’s capable of. You’ll probably see some big games from him this year.”
