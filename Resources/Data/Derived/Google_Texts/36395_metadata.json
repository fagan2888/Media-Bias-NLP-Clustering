Applause reached near-deafening levels when Trump, sporting his signature \"Make America Great Again\" hat, asked for their vote.\n\nThe crowd rallied around his call to fundamentally change the policies set in place by President Barack Obama's administration.\n\n\"We're going to make change, but it's not going to be Obama change,\" Trump said. \"This is going to be real change.\"\n\nThe candidate spoke about building a border wall between the U.S. and Mexico, as well as revitalizing the military, doing away with Common Core and repealing the Affordable Care Act \u2014 commonly known as Obamacare.\n\nRelated: Donald Trump protestors, supporters face off outside Fountain Hills rally\n\nRolling Stones' \"Time Is On My Side\" #nowplaying at #TrumpRally.

Several times throughout the rally, he mentioned how he loves seeing large crowds at his rallies.\n\n\"We have a silent majority that's no longer silent,\" Trump said at the rally. \"It's the loud, noisy majority.\"\n\nBefore Trump delivered his address, several speakers addressed the audience, including Mary Ann Mendoza, the mother of the late Sgt. Brandon Mendoza.\n\nSgt. Mendoza was killed in a head-on collision with a car driven by an illegal immigrant, she said.\n\nThe man who ran into him was intoxicated three times past the legal limit, high on methamphetamine and driving on the wrong side of the road, she said.\n\nAs Mendoza finished describing the man, a rally-goer yelled out, \"Deport him!\"\n\nMaricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, a consistent supporter of Trump and his policies, took the stage immediately before Trump, and continued the call to put an end to illegal immigration. Arpaio also called for Mexico's government to pay for the border wall.\n\n\"I'll tell you what, if they don't pay for that wall, we'll take away their foreign aid and then they'll pay,\" Arpaio said.\n\nSupporters at the rally said Trump's stance on illegal immigration was one of his largest selling points as a candidate.\n\n\"Thank you, everybody. Go vote. Go vote!\" - .@realDonaldTrump pic.twitter.com/jcNyUJS7rh \u2014 Joshua Bowling (@MrJoshuaBowling) March 19, 2016\n\nJoan Rodgers, a Trump supporter and Arizona resident since 1989, said she wants Trump to enact strict immigration policies if elected president.\n\n\"I hope he closes the border,\" she said. \"Living here in Arizona, it's really become a big problem for us.\"\n\nAnother supporter, Valerie Roller, said she thinks Trump is the best-suited for the job of president because of his love for the country.\n\n\"He loves the country, I love the country, so we have a lot ... in common,\" Roller said.\n\nTrump promised his supporters that he will make the country great again if they cast their vote for him.\n\n\"We will be proud of our country again,\" he said.\n\nAs the applause waxed and waned throughout Trump's speech, he vowed one last national improvement to his supporters.\n\n\"Nobody \u2014 and I mean nobody \u2014 is going to mess with us anymore,\" he said.\n\nReach the reporter at jwbowlin@asu.edu or follow @mrjoshuabowling on Twitter.\n\nLike The State Press on Facebook and follow @statepress on Twitter.\n\nRelated Stories", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://d1v77p6x66ivz.cloudfront.net/20150925Qkxa2gsvYe/dist/img/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "description": "GOP presidential front-runner Donald Trump promised reform at the border, in the military and in healthcare\u00a0at a Fountain Hills, Arizona rally on Saturday.", "generator": "Gryphon 20160217001 (Foundry 6.1-20150615001)", "title": "The State Press", "og": {"url": "http://www.statepress.com/article/2016/03/donald-trump-presidential-election-2016-arizona-rally", "image": "http://d1v77p6x66ivz.cloudfront.net/20150925Qkxa2gsvYe/dist/img/fb-hidden-icon.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "GOP presidential front-runner Donald Trump promised reform at the border, in the military and in healthcare\u00a0at a Fountain Hills, Arizona rally on Saturday.", "title": "Donald Trump promises change, border reform at Fountain Hills rally"}, "twitter": {"site": "statepress", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#a44248", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://d1v77p6x66ivz.cloudfront.net/20150925Qkxa2gsvYe/dist/img/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "author": "Joshua Bowling", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Photo by Reilly Kneedler | State Press Presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks during his rally at Fountain Park in Fountain Hills, Arizona, on Saturday, March 19, 2016.\nRelated: Donald Trump protestors, supporters face off outside Fountain Hills rallyRolling Stones' \"Time Is On My Side\" #nowplaying at #TrumpRally.\nBy Joshua Bowling | 03/19/16 3:11pmThousands of supporters brushed shoulders on Saturday to catch a glimpse of GOP presidential front-runner, Donald Trump at his Fountain Hills rally.\n\"We're going to make change, but it's not going to be Obama change,\" Trump said.\n@realDonaldTrump pic.twitter.com/jcNyUJS7rh \u2014 Joshua Bowling (@MrJoshuaBowling) March 19, 2016Joan Rodgers, a Trump supporter and Arizona resident since 1989, said she wants Trump to enact strict immigration policies if elected president."}
