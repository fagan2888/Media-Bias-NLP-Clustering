The Milwaukee Police Department has released surveillance video in an effort to identify a suspect in an armed robbery of a CVS store last Wednesday.

The robbery of the store at 7550 W. Perkins Place occurred at 12:38 a.m. on Sept. 11 after the suspect took a bottle of water out of a cooler and approached the checkout counter, as if to purchase it, according to police.

He then told the cashier, "Give me all of the money in the drawer before I put this thing on you," while holding his hand in his pocket as if he had a gun, police said.

The cashier opened the register and gave money to the suspect. The suspect then walked out of the store and ran eastbound through the parking lot.

The suspect is said to be in his 30s, about 6 feet tall and 160 to 180 pounds, with a slim build, short hair and mustache. He was wearing a blue T-shirt, gray sweatpants with a white stripe down the side and black shoes.

Anyone with information is asked to call Milwaukee Police at (414) 935-7360.
