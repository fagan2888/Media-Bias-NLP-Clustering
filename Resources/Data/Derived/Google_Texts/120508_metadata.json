Murkowski is one of the few elected officials not running for office this fall \u2014 she is next up for reelection in 2016.\n\nAt the Chamber and in an interview afterwards, Murkowski spoke about gridlock in congress, reproductive rights, and her work with the women of the Senate.\n\nAnd while she wouldn\u2019t say who she\u2019s supporting in the Republican Senate primary, it was pretty clear who she won\u2019t be voting for.\n\nDuring a question and answer session after her talk at the Chamber, Murkowski fielded the inevitable question. It came from Sitka City Attorney Robin Koutchak (KO-chak).\n\nKoutchak: Begich or Sullivan \u2013 are you willing to say anything?\n\nMurkowski: Robin, how could you do this to me? [laughter]\n\nBeigich or Sullivan \u2013 that would be Democratic Senator Mark Begich or former attorney general Dan Sullivan, who is currently locked in a primary race for the Republican nomination to run against Begich this fall.\n\nMurkowski said she she\u2019s staying out of the Republican primary.\n\n\u201cAnd I tell anybody who asks that I think we have two very qualified candidates,\u201d she said.\n\nThose two candidates are Sullivan and Lt. Governor Mead Treadwell. Murkowski called them both \u201cclose, personal friends,\u201d and said either would be a strong contender in November.\n\nBut, of course, there\u2019s a third man in the race: Fairbanks lawyer Joe Miller. Miller beat Murkowski in the Republican primary in 2010, but Murkowski came back to win the general election in a write-in campaign.\n\nAsked whether she had considered the prospect of working with Miller in the Senate, Murkowski said, \u201cEverything that I can tell indicates that he will not be the Republican nominee, so we\u2019ll just see where it goes from there.\u201d\n\nIf she was unwilling to take sides in the primary, there was one thing Murkowski was very clear on: she said she\u2019s appalled by the unprecedented influx of outside money coming in to this Senate race.\n\n\u201cWhen there is over $30-million spent on the airwaves, in advertising, in Alaska, on these political races \u2013 and that\u2019s what we\u2019re talking about \u2014 that\u2019s wrong,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is just wrong.\u201d\n\nDespite her support for a Treadwell or Sullivan candidacy, Murkowski has some clear differences with the men running for Senate \u2014 in part on reproductive rights.\n\nAll three Republican primary candidates support the Supreme Court\u2019s recent Hobby Lobby decision, allowing employers to drop contraceptives from their health plans on religious grounds.\n\nMurkowski was one of three Senate Republicans who supported a bill that would have reversed the Supreme Court\u2019s decision. She said she\u2019s no fan of the Affordable Care Act but she worries that the Hobby Lobby ruling would restrict women\u2019s access to contraception \u2014 a longtime issue for her.\n\nKCAW: Is it frustrating to hold the position that you do within the party?\n\nMurkowski: I am frustrated that an issue that I thought most of us had resolved decades ago, apparently is no longer resolved, or is still in question by many. Again, I feel pretty strongly that if you don\u2019t like abortion, as I do not like abortion, then one way to reduce the number of abortions is to provide for that affordable, accessible contraceptive coverage. And it does seem that we are losing ground instead of gaining ground when it comes to women and their reproductive rights.\n\nMeanwhile, on the subject of Congress itself, Murkowski sounded exasperated.\n\n\u201cWe do little more than seemingly kick the can to the other side of an election,\u201d she said. \u201cFact of the matter is, folks, we have elections every two years.\u201d\n\nOne bright spot, she said, is the women of the Senate, who meet regularly to try to build relationships across the partisan divide. The twenty women \u2013 16 Democrats and four Republicans \u2013 meet every month or so for dinner, with just three rules, Murkowski said: no notes, no staff, and no leaks.\n\nThat allows for frank conversations on hot button issues.\n\n\u201cI will bring up the thing that as a Republican in a state like Alaska you can\u2019t talk about: gun control,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve had some amazing conversations with some of my female colleagues who come from urban areas, who can\u2019t imagine hunting to feed your family, who can\u2019t understand why you would ever feel safe around a gun. And so for me to be able to share my experiences as an Alaskan, coming from a hunting family, and what it means to me\u2026\u201d\n\nOf course, Murkowski said, that doesn\u2019t mean the women of the Senate end up voting together\u2026\n\n\u201cBecause we are all very independent in our views \u2014 I know you would be surprised to hear that,\u201d she said to laughter. \u201cBut I think it really does make the Senate a better place when we can have relationships and better understand what one another brings to the table.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"generator": "MasterSlider 2.12.2 - Responsive Touch Image Slider", "og": {"site_name": "KCAW", "description": "Senator Lisa Murkowski visited Sitka last week and spoke to a packed house at the Chamber of Commerce about gridlock in Congress, reproductive rights, and her work with the women of the Senate.
