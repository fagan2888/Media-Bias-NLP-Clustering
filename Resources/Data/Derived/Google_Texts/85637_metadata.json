The most common method uses a laser to form various materials, from epoxy resins to powdered titanium, into solid objects. Local Motors uses a slightly different deposition process that also builds up objects essentially one pixel at a time. Both methods are relatively slow compared to conventional manufacturing but offer the advantage of allowing near endless customization.\n\nLocal Motors publicly demonstrated its concept at the Detroit Auto Show in January. That prototype, dubbed the Strati, had barely 50 individual parts, beyond the electric power train.", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "cnbcnewsstory", "description": "Local Motors plans to get into the automotive industry next year when it launches what it promises will be the world's first 3-D printed car.", "author": "Paul A.
