And with 1,700 applications for only about 500 new beds, competition will be fierce.\n\nFlorida just ended a 15-year moratorium on new nursing home construction.\n\nAgency for Health Care Administration Secretary Elizabeth Dudek said this could be the last big round of new nursing homes because of a cap.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll still have some need, unless we do some unusual circumstances, still be some small amount of need if we were to give out the full 493 this batch,\u201d Dudek said. \u201cBut we\u2019re coming really close.\u201d\n\nA nursing home lobbying group says Florida will need 20,000 new nursing home beds in the next 20 years because of the aging baby boomer population. Dudek, though, said that number may be high.\n\n\u201cWe do have a lot of people who will be able to live in the community much longer than they did historically,\u201d Dudek said. \u201cSo the 20,000 might be a high number.\u201d\n\nThe state could also approve new heart and liver transplant programs in the Tampa area, and a new kidney and heart transplant program in South Florida.\n\nWMFE is a partner with Health News Florida, which receives support from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "Nearly thirty companies will be competing to build new nursing homes in Florida.
