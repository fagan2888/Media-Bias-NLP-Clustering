Chris Jones (R-Suffolk) at the Capitol in Richmond on Wednesday. (Steve Helber/AP)\n\nVirginia House Speaker Bill Howell (R-Stafford) is leading the campaign to block Medicaid expansion even though the largest hospital in his Fredericksburg district says it desperately needs the money to continue supporting health care for the city\u2019s poor.\n\nFred Rankin, chief executive of the nonprofit parent of Mary Washington Hospital, said rebuffing expansion would cost his institution $14 million a year available under the Affordable Care Act. That would threaten the hospital\u2019s support for a free clinic and community health centers that serve low-income people.\n\n\u201cThe stakes are dramatic,\u201d Rankin said. \u201cThose safety net programs are in jeopardy.\u201d\n\nRankin also said he knows Howell well but is baffled by the legislator\u2019s inflexibility.\n\n\u201cWe have disagreed over the years, but I have always found him to have an open mind and be willing to compromise,\u201d Rankin said. \u201cThis time, it appears that he is really drawing the line in the sand around no compromise. . . . It\u2019s a behavior I haven\u2019t seen in the past.\u201d\n\nHowell\u2019s spokesman, Matt Moran, responded by citing the GOP\u2019s call Tuesday for a special General Assembly session to discuss Medicaid expansion.\n\n\u201cHow can we be refusing to compromise, when we are willing to hold a special session on the very issue they\u2019re talking about?\u201d Moran said.\n\nBut the appeal for a special session is just a legislative maneuver \u2014 a smart one, admittedly \u2014 to reduce the Democrats\u2019 leverage by trying to pry the Medicaid issue away from the rest of the budget. Moran made clear that Howell had no appetite for yielding on substance.\n\n\u201cThe speaker\u2019s position has been very clear with respect to Medicaid expansion as a whole. Obamacare has proven to be disastrous,\u201d he said.\n\nUnfortunately for Virginia\u2019s hospitals and working poor, Howell has plenty of company. A decisive number of other House Republicans oppose expanding Medicaid, even though it would disproportionately help their constituents.\n\nThe latter is true because many Republican delegates represent mostly rural areas and small cities in southern and southwestern Virginia with a comparatively high share of low-income residents.\n\nOf the 50 House districts with the highest percentage of Medicaid recipients, 32 are represented by Republicans, according to a study by three political scientists at the University of Mary Washington.\n\nThose legislators are willing to forgo the federal largesse rather than risk a primary challenge by tea party candidates accusing them of betraying the conservative cause.\n\n\u201cMany of the Republicans in these districts are in a very tough spot,\u201d University of Mary Washington professor Stephen Farnsworth said. \u201cThe message on Obamacare in Republican circles has been no collaboration, no cooperation.\u201d\n\nOpponents object mainly that the U.S. budget deficit is so large that it\u2019s imprudent to expect the federal government to fund a broader Medicaid program for the long run.\n\nBut Virginia could drop the plan if Uncle Sam reneged. Why not accept the $5 million a day that\u2019s being offered?\n\nThe GOP position is maddening to health-care providers in economically struggling communities such as Danville, on the North Carolina border. The city of 43,000 suffers some of the state\u2019s highest unemployment rates since textiles and furniture jobs went overseas.\n\nPiedmont Access to Health Services, or PATHS, which runs four health centers for low-income people in the area, said 5,000 of its 12,000 patients would obtain health insurance under Medicaid if the program were expanded.\n\n\u201cThey have to choose now between, \u2018Am I going to pay my rent, buy food or buy health insurance?\u2019 \u201d PATHS chief executive Kay Crane said.\n\nDanville\u2019s delegate, Danny Marshall III (R), opposes Medicaid expansion.\n\nOur region, because of its comparative affluence, would suffer less than most if Medicaid expansion is rejected. But such a decision still would be a burden to area hospitals.\n\nInova, a large nonprofit system operating five hospitals in Northern Virginia, would forgo about $100 million a year. It would hire fewer doctors, buy less equipment and cut back on research.\n\n\u201cAll of those things get brought under pressure, and you\u2019re forced either to trim them back or slow their growth,\u201d Inova chief executive Knox Singleton said.\n\nHe noted the consequences would be more dire elsewhere.\n\n\u201cIn any community in southwest Virginia, you\u2019re talking survival of the hospital,\u201d Singleton said.\n\nIt\u2019s too bad most of the legislators there care more about sending a political message.\n\nI discuss local issues Friday at 8:50 a.m. on WAMU (88.5 FM).
