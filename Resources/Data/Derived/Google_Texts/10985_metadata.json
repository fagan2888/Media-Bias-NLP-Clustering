They were soggy souvenirs for sure.\n\nDjokovic earned his fifth Key Biscayne title Sunday, beating Andy Murray for the seventh consecutive time by showing superior stamina in the subtropical heat to win the Miami Open final 7-6 (3), 4-6, 6-0.\n\nMurray broke in the final game of the second set to even the match, but fatigue then became a factor on a sunny, humid, 80-degree afternoon.\n\nDjokovic was the fitter player down the stretch.\n\n\u201cIt was brutal \u2014 it\u2019s very warm,\u201d he said. \u201cI was prepared for a physical battle. But it\u2019s one thing to prepare and another thing to experience it on the court. I was expecting very long rallies and just managed to play the third set the way I was supposed to, and I\u2019m thrilled with this win.\u201d\n\nThe top-ranked Djokovic became the first man to complete the Indian Wells-Key Biscayne spring sweep three times, and he has done it twice in a row. He beat Murray in the Indian Wells semifinals and in the Australian Open final for his eighth Grand Slam title two months ago.\n\nMurray fell to 8-18 against Djokovic.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not quite there with Novak yet, but I feel like I\u2019m getting a little closer,\u201d Murray said with a chuckle. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I couldn\u2019t make more of a fight of it in the third set. I was trying. My legs were tired and I couldn\u2019t quite finish hard enough.\u201d\n\nMurray will climb from fourth to third in the new rankings, but he has lost 12 consecutive matches to his biggest rivals \u2014 Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer \u2014 since winning Wimbledon in 2013 by beating Djokovic in the final.\n\nDjokovic was inconsistent early in the tournament and let his frustration show, receiving two code violations and a point penalty during one win. He drew another code violation in the final for swearing after he lost the second set, but he quickly regained his poise.\n\nIn the last set, Murray hit two weary backhands into the net to lose serve and fall behind 1-0. Two games later he saved five break points before dumping another backhand into the net to go down 3-0, and Djokovic easily closed out the win.\n\nMurray acknowledged his third-set shutout by tweeting, \u201cThis egg today wasn\u2019t appreciated on Easter.\u201d\n\nDjokovic\u2019s fresher legs at the end of the 2-hour, 47-minute match were especially impressive because Murray lives in Miami and is more accustomed to the South Florida heat.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t feeling great at all on the court,\u201d Djokovic said. \u201cHe was making me work. But he felt the same.\u201d\n\nMurray conceded he wilted at the finish, but said he trains as hard as he can.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that I can do a whole lot more physically to get in much better shape,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s tough, because it was obviously pretty brutal conditions out there, and he was stronger than me at the end for sure.\u201d\n\nMartina Hingis and Sania Mirza won the title in women\u2019s doubles by defeating Ekaterina Makarova and Elena Vesnina 7-5, 6-1.\n\nThe men\u2019s final matched two of the game\u2019s best retrievers, and they waged a succession of long, entertaining rallies in the early going. Djokovic\u2019s legs splayed as he skidded on the hardcourt digging out shots in the corners, and Murray hustled just as hard, closing one 35-stroke marathon with a backhand winner.\n\nBut the quality of play was patchy, and Djokovic converted only 5 of 18 break-point chances. Both players blew overheads and easy volleys, and the bright sun bothered them in the opening set, when they looked directly into the glare at the north end of the court.\n\nThe player with his back to the sun won the first 10 games, which included four service breaks. In the tiebreaker, Djokovic took a 4-0 lead with his back to the sun and won the final two points on unforced errors by Murray.\n\nAs the angle of the sun changed, both players settled in on their serves and traded holds to 6-5 in the second set. Murray then came up with the shot of the match, blocking back a Djokovic overhead and landing it on the sideline for a winner.\n\nMurray smacked a return winner on the next point to break at love and even the match, but that was his last hurrah.\n\nHis consolation: He\u2019s getting married Saturday in his hometown of Dunblane, Scotland. Djokovic won\u2019t be attending.\n\n\u201cNot invited,\u201d Djokovic said with a smile. \u201cBut I wish him all the best.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Novak Djokovic wins 5th Key Biscayne title by beating Andy Murray", "title": "Novak Djokovic wins 5th Key Biscayne title by beating Andy Murray", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/04/05/novak-djokovic-wins-5th-key-biscayne-title-by-beating-andy-murray/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150405__miami-openp1.jpg", "height": 491}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150405__miami-openp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-05T14:36:49+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-24T19:10:53+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "In the last set, Murray hit two weary backhands into the net to lose serve and fall behind 1-0.\nAs the angle of the sun changed, both players settled in on their serves and traded holds to 6-5 in the second set.\nHe drew another code violation in the final for swearing after he lost the second set, but he quickly regained his poise.\nMurray broke in the final game of the second set to even the match, but fatigue then became a factor on a sunny, humid, 80-degree afternoon.\nDjokovic earned his fifth Key Biscayne title Sunday, beating Andy Murray for the seventh consecutive time by showing superior stamina in the subtropical heat to win the Miami Open final 7-6 (3), 4-6, 6-0."}
