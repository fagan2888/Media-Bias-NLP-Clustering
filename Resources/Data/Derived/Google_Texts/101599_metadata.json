One solution policymakers invoked was enacting the Orphan Drug Act of 1983 which provided a number of benefits\u2013including lower tax rates\u2013for innovators who created drugs to treat rare diseases.\n\nWas it effective? According to a paper by Miller and Lanthier (2016), the answer is yes.\n\nBefore 1983 only 10 drugs had been approved to treat a rare disease, but as of November 2015 over 450 additional new orphan indications (both new drugs and secondary indications for previously approved drugs) had been approved.\n\nThis clearly is a large increase. The question is, were these simply \u201cme too\u201d drugs or do these drugs represent significant advances in care.\n\nOver 50 percent of the drugs were first in class, and 78 percent received a priority review. Drugs approved as either therapeutic or supportive therapies for rare cancers represented the highest proportion of these drugs (35 percent).\n\nPart of the increase here was due to thee identification of genomic subgroups in oncology. Further, this study does not evaluate whether the government funds invested in the Orphan Drug Act were worth the cost. Nevertheless, it is clear that this piece of legislation did incentivize innovators to invest more R&D funds in rare diseases.\n\nPhoto: Flickr", "article_metadata": {"description": "Before 1983 only 10 drugs had been approved to treat a rare disease, but as of November 2015 over 450 additional new orphan indications (both new drugs and secondary indications for previously approved drugs) had been approved.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "MedCity News", "description": "Before 1983 only 10 drugs had been approved to treat a rare disease, but as of November 2015 over 450 additional new orphan indications (both new drugs and secondary indications for previously approved drugs) had been approved.", "title": "Orphan Drug Act\u2019s role as an incentive to develop rare disease treatments", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://medcitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/hope_flickrdieseldemon.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-04-11T00:51:00-04:00", "url": "http://medcitynews.com/2016/04/orphan-drug-act/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://medcitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/hope_flickrdieseldemon.jpg", "description": "Before 1983 only 10 drugs had been approved to treat a rare disease, but as of November 2015 over 450 additional new orphan indications (both new drugs and secondary indications for previously approved drugs) had been approved.", "card": "summary", "title": "Orphan Drug Act's role as an incentive to develop rare disease treatments - MedCity News"}, "fb": {"app_id": 148725768475669}, "google-site-verification": "xudQg7nxVR9ifmMTY4Tf-0wVtX9b6rWLQd0utCweGOc", "keywords": "weight loss, obesity, overweight,diabetes,massachusetts,medical devices,obesity,startups,healthcare innovation, medcity news,medcity news,san francisco, startups, life sciences,accelerator,rock health,startup advice,startup funding,patient monitoring system, motion sensors ,dc,healthcare it,washington,foodborne pathogens, diagnostics company, diagnostic platforms,minimally invasive surgery, laser surgery,cambridge,dealflow,hospitals,wellpoint, healthways, health and wellness, employee wellness programs,investing,wellness,medtronic, shanghai innovation center, china, r&d,china,mdt,minneapolis,minnesota,publics,twin cities,ulcerative colitis, abbott labs, humira,abbott labs,doctors,pharmaceuticals,skin disorders, pharmaceuticals, md anderson cancer center,cancer,texas,renal denervation, st. jude medical,st. jude medical,stj,emr, ehr, electronic health records, electronic medical records, certified emr,certified emr,ehr,electronic health records,electronic medical records,advanced cellular technology,amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,embryonic stem cells,geron corporation,lou gehrig\\'s disease,macular degeneration,regenerative medicine,spinal cord damage,value-based healthcare system, obamacare, fee-for-service model,california,cleveland,health insurance,insurance,ohio,pennsylvania,politics,cancer treatment options library, aetna, aet, healthcare it,aet,aetna,health it,phi,philadelphia,orphan drugs, pharma, , MedCity News", "article": {"section": "Daily", "tag": "pharma", "published_time": "2016-04-11T06:00:13-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-11T00:51:00-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,width=device-width,user-scalable=no,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe032f\"", "article_summary": "Drugs approved as either therapeutic or supportive therapies for rare cancers represented the highest proportion of these drugs (35 percent).\nOne solution policymakers invoked was enacting the Orphan Drug Act of 1983 which provided a number of benefits\u2013including lower tax rates\u2013for innovators who created drugs to treat rare diseases.\nHow can policymakers incentivize innovators to invest in new treatments for rare diseases?\nNevertheless, it is clear that this piece of legislation did incentivize innovators to invest more R&D funds in rare diseases.\nBefore 1983 only 10 drugs had been approved to treat a rare disease, but as of November 2015 over 450 additional new orphan indications (both new drugs and secondary indications for previously approved drugs) had been approved."}
