Brad Cochennet showed the commissioners a chart of emergency room visits \u2014 an increase from 4,270 visits in 2012 to 6,983 in 2015. He pointed out the significant increase in ER visits, so far, during 2016 \u2014 as indicated by the short yellow bar on the upper left corner.\n\nAnother chart showed \u2014 with a linear estimate \u2014 the increase in the number of \u201cprocedures\u201d (tests, x-rays, exams, MRIs, operations) at the Medical Center since 2009. The graph continues the line four years into the future, to indicate where we might be headed.\n\nEither Pagosa Springs has a lot more sick people lately, or we are simply more willing to visit our local hospital and to order more procedures. I suspect the latter.\n\nMr. Cochennet shared some maps of the expansion project, and explained that the addition of a two-story primary care clinic was likely only the first phase of what will be ongoing expansion of the Medical Center in coming years.\n\nThis is not the map we saw at the BOCC meeting, but it shows the footprint of the current hospital \u2014 in purple \u2014 and the addition now underway, in blue.\n\nThe charts above were taken from the 2015 Annual Report, which is not easily available on the Medical Center website at the moment \u2014 but was included in a PDF I found through a Google search. You can download that document here.\n\nFollowing the BOCC presentation, Mr. Cochennet headed back to work, but I was able to waylay him in the parking lot for a few minutes. I wanted to ask his opinion about ColoradoCare \u2014 since ColoradoCare, also known as Amendment 69, was going to feature prominently in my article series about the Republic of Colorado.\n\nDid he imagine that Amendment 69 would have a significant impact on the Pagosa Springs Medical Center?\n\nHe had a few thoughts on that subject. But first, a bit of medical history.\n\nBack in the late 1950s, an ambitious group of well-meaning Pagosa citizens came together to build a medical clinic for their little rural town. The project was supported in part by one of America\u2019s largest corporations: Sears, Roebuck & Co. The monster Sears, Roebuck mail-order catalogue was the Walmart to rural America during the first half of the 20th century, and among the many items available in their catalog was a selection of complete home \u201ckits\u201d \u2014 all the parts and materials you needed to build your own house, ordered from Sears and delivered to your front door. (Except of course, you didn\u2019t yet have a front door. But that was included in the kit.)\n\nSears also sold complete commercial buildings through their catalog, and the fine citizens of Pagosa Springs \u2014 looking to build the town\u2019s first medical clinic \u2014 sought the support of Sears Roebuck to construct a building on some land across the street from the Spa Motel on San Juan Street. The land had been donated by the Town of Pagosa Springs.\n\nThe new clinic was named after one of Pagosa\u2019s pioneer doctors \u2014 a homeopath named Dr. Mary Fisher.\n\nThe clinic operated at the San Juan Street location until 1996, when a different set of well-meaning Pagosans organized the construction of a much larger and more modern \u201cDr. Mary Fisher Clinic\u201d on South Pagosa Boulevard, on some land donated by Tom and Mary Grant, the builders of the uptown City Market shopping center.\n\nThe vacated building became home to the Seeds of Learning Early Childhood Center for a few years, and then was demolished and replaced with a parking lot.\n\nMeanwhile, the new, $2.5 million Dr. Mary Fisher Clinic was struggling financially, and gradually became the focus of considerable political controversy, leading to the closing of its doors in 2005. Another group of well-meaning citizens then banded together to propose a \u201cRural Access Hospital\u201d at the clinic site. \u201cRural access hospital\u201d is a federal designation for a facility in a relatively isolated community that benefits from augmented Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements. As our readers may know already, the Affordable Care Act \u2014 Obamacare \u2014 increased the federal subsidies for Medicaid, as a way to finance healthcare for America\u2019s more impoverished citizens\u2026 the people who, for whatever reason, have no health insurance. According to the Pagosa Springs Medical Center\u2019s 2015 annual report, about 57 percent of their Inpatient and Outpatient revenues appear to have come from Medicare and Medicaid \u2014 that is to say, government-funded reimbursements.\n\nFrom a recent series of articles on the American healthcare crisis, published by PBS:\n\nThe Medicare population is growing. By 2030 it is expected to nearly double, to 76 million Americans. Medicare is already the third largest government program, and its spending, as a percentage of the federal budget has doubled in just twenty years. The number of senior citizens in the United States is increasing steadily, and advances in medical technology are keeping them alive longer and longer. As a result, there is growing concern about the cost of financing care for future generations. The challenges to Medicare are long-term. With the decline in the number of workers paying into the system through their payroll taxes, many experts believe we will need to find additional sources of funding for Medicare in the future. Possible approaches include new taxes on products like tobacco, or greater contributions from the nation\u2019s wealthier seniors\u2026\n\nOr, maybe there\u2019s another solution?\n\nThe Republic of Colorado? To the rescue?\n\nRead Part Three\u2026", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://pagosadailypost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/16LogoPDP_120.jpg"}, "article_summary": "Did he imagine that Amendment 69 would have a significant impact on the Pagosa Springs Medical Center?\nEither Pagosa Springs has a lot more sick people lately, or we are simply more willing to visit our local hospital and to order more procedures.\nThe land had been donated by the Town of Pagosa Springs.\nAnother chart showed \u2014 with a linear estimate \u2014 the increase in the number of \u201cprocedures\u201d (tests, x-rays, exams, MRIs, operations) at the Medical Center since 2009.\nBack in the late 1950s, an ambitious group of well-meaning Pagosa citizens came together to build a medical clinic for their little rural town."}
