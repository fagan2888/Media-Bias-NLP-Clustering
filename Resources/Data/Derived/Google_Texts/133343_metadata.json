An additional seven people surrendered to the Sheriff\u2019s Office for arrears totaling $171,792.98.\n\n\u201cTime and time again we are seeing parents struggle because someone has shirked their responsibility,\u201d Cryan said in the statement. \u201cWe want to send a message that if you are not paying your obligation for child support, we will pursue you and we will catch you. If this type of enforcement coerces other parents to pay what they owe, it is worth it.\u201d\n\nThe roundup was led by Family Violence Unit Commander Lt. Jeffery Coon and Unit Supervisor Sgt. Clifford Meros. All the arrests were made without incident.\n\nThose who were arrested were committed to the Union County Jail pending a Superior Court appearance.
