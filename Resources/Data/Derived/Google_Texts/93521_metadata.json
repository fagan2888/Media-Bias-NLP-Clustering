Currently, 25 states and the District of Columbia have opted to expand Medicaid coverage under ACA.Studies have shown Medicaid beneficiaries tend to use emergency room services more often than those with private health insurance. A research letter published in the Sept. 18 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association found adults with Medicaid coverage in California were visiting emergency departments in that state at a higher rate than the uninsured and those with private insurance.One reason for this is that low-income populations, many of whom are eligible for Medicaid coverage, are more likely to suffer from more chronic conditions than other socioeconomic groups.Study co-author Dr. Jesse Pines acknowledged there are still unanswered questions about the financial impact the Affordable Care Act will have on emergency departments. For example, it's unclear how the new coverage will play out for emergency departments under value-based payment models.\u201cWe were able to show that the per-visit reimbursement in a fee-for-service model will probably go up,\u201d Pines said. \u201cIt still remains to be seen what's going to happen with those other issues (payment models).\u201dBetween 1990 and 2009, the number of emergency department in urban areas declined by 27% as the rate of emergency-room visit increased, according to a 2011 study published in JAMA \u201cI think the overall impact (of the ACA) on emergency care is really yet to be determined,\u201d Pines said. \u201cI think it will be determined by the success of the Affordable Care Act on impacting care models outside of the emergency department and how much efficiency can be gained by changing care delivery.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#0a365e", "description": "Reimbursements to emergency departments for outpatient visits are likely to improve once the nation's new health reform law is fully implemented, a new study found.", "title": "Healthcare Reform Update: Outpatient reimbursement likely to improve with implementation of ACA, study finds", "og": {"site_name": "Modern Healthcare", "description": "Reimbursements to emergency departments for outpatient visits are likely to improve once the nation's new health reform law is fully implemented, a new study found.", "title": "Healthcare Reform Update: Outpatient reimbursement likely to improve with implementation of ACA, study finds", "url": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20131105/NEWS/311059965", "image": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CH/20131105/NEWS/311059965/AR/0/AR-311059965.jpg&maxw=1200&maxh=630", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com", "description": "Reimbursements to emergency departments for outpatient visits are likely to improve once the nation's new health reform law is fully implemented, a new study found.", "title": "Healthcare Reform Update: Outpatient reimbursement likely to improve with implementation of ACA, study finds", "image": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CH/20131105/NEWS/311059965/AR/0/AR-311059965.jpg&imageversion=thumbnail&maxw=240&maxh=240", "creator": "@modrnhealthcr", "site": "@modrnhealthcr", "card": "summary"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Modern Healthcare", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "url": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20131105/NEWS/311059965", "published_at": "2013-11-05", "msapplication-TileImage": "https:/raw.githubusercontent.com/modernhealthcare/mh-logo/master/ms-touch-icon-144x144-precomposed.png", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "image": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CH/20131105/NEWS/311059965/AR/0/AR-311059965.jpg&maxw=360&maxh=240", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0cf8\"", "article_summary": "\u201cOver the next few years, that picture could change substantially.\u201dUnder the law, all adults making up to 138% of the federal poverty level are eligible to receive Medicaid coverage.\nCurrently, 25 states and the District of Columbia have opted to expand Medicaid coverage under ACA.Studies have shown Medicaid beneficiaries tend to use emergency room services more often than those with private health insurance.\nFor example, it's unclear how the new coverage will play out for emergency departments under value-based payment models.\u201cWe were able to show that the per-visit reimbursement in a fee-for-service model will probably go up,\u201d Pines said.\n\u201cI think it will be determined by the success of the Affordable Care Act on impacting care models outside of the emergency department and how much efficiency can be gained by changing care delivery.\u201d\n\u201cIt still remains to be seen what's going to happen with those other issues (payment models).\u201dBetween 1990 and 2009, the number of emergency department in urban areas declined by 27% as the rate of emergency-room visit increased, according to a 2011 study published in JAMA \u201cI think the overall impact (of the ACA) on emergency care is really yet to be determined,\u201d Pines said."}
