Tim Huelskamp is back in the saddle. Three years after being stripped of his committee seats for disobeying House leadership, the Kansas Republican has a seat on his party\u2019s influential conference steering committee.\n\nAn outsider now inside, Huelskamp\u2019s appointment Thursday is just the latest shakeup rocking Congress as the House moves slowly back to regular order. Now he\u2019ll help determine who gets what committee assignments.\n\nHuelskamp says the appointment is \u201cquite the turnaround\u201d from years past.\n\nIn 2012, Huelskamp was booted from both the Agriculture and Budget Committees after bickering with GOP leadership. At the time, Rep Lynn Westmoreland, R-Ga., blamed the actions on Huelskamp\u2019s \u201cinability to work with other members.\u201d\n\nHis constituents back in Kansas didn\u2019t care, Huelskamp, 47, recalled in an interview with The Daily Signal.\n\n\u201cThe message from home has always been the same,\u201d Huelskamp said, summing it up as: \u201cWe don\u2019t care if others don\u2019t like you or if they kick you off your committee. Stand your ground.\u201d\n\nHuelskamp, previously a member of the Kansas Senate for 13 years, was elected to represent the state\u2019s 1st Congressional District in 2010. He hails from a family of farmers in Fowler, Kan.\n\nThe chairman of the House\u2019s conservative Tea Party Caucus, Huelskamp is also a member of the emerging House Freedom Caucus, the conservative group that helped push House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, out of the speaker\u2019s office in late September.\n\nHouse conservatives complain that under Boehner, the Republican steering committee was stacked with the speaker\u2019s allies and establishment loyalists. Since its founding, the Freedom Caucus regularly has agitated for reform.\n\nAnd now Huelskamp\u2019s position is clearly evidence of a new era under Speaker Paul Ryan. Huelskamp told The Daily Signal that he \u201cthanks\u201d Ryan \u201cfor following up on his promises\u201d to change the way Congress does business.\n\nSince picking up the speaker\u2019s gavel in late October, Ryan has taken several steps toward returning the House to what lawmakers call regular order. Huelskamp is just the latest beneficiary.\n\nHuelskamp said popularity comes with his influential new position.\n\n\u201cWhat I found out very quickly was that I discovered a lot of new friends in the conference,\u201d he quipped.\n\nBut Huelskamp said he is most interested in changing the steering committee into an efficient meritocracy that considers talent over party loyalty:\n\nIt has to be merit-based. I believe we have dozens of folks in the Republican conference that, just because they were conservative, they\u2019re not on the higher-profile committees.\n\nThe steering committee will begin its heaviest lifting in the new year as the House begins sorting out and assigning new committee responsibilities. Huelskamp says he already has capable members in mind.\n\n\u201cI know a lot of conservatives with a lot of great talent areas,\u201d he said. \u201cI think I happen to be one of them, as a fifth-generation farmer with a Ph.D. in ag [agriculture] policy. Everybody understands I should be on that committee.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"We have dozens of just because they were conservative, they\u2019re not on the higher-profile committees,\" the Kansas Republican tells The Daily Signal.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\"We have dozens of just because they were conservative, they\u2019re not on the higher-profile committees,\" the Kansas Republican tells The Daily Signal.", "title": "Reforms Bring GOP Rabble-Rouser Huelskamp Back to Power", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151214_Huelskamp.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-12-15T19:45:02+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1OsBgqa"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\"We have dozens of just because they were conservative, they\u2019re not on the higher-profile committees,\" the Kansas Republican tells The Daily Signal.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151214_Huelskamp.jpg"}, "title": "Reforms Bring GOP Rabble-Rouser Huelskamp Back to Power", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Politics", "tag": "House of Representatives", "published_time": "2015-12-14T18:25:07+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-15T19:45:02+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Tim Huelskamp, party loyalty, Republican leadership, Steering Committee, Paul Ryan, House of Representatives.
