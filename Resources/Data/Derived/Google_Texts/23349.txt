The California attorney general is reviewing the proposed change in control and governance of two nonprofits, California-based St. Joseph Health System and Providence Health & Services, based out of Washington.

The two entities have previously announced their partnership plan, which would unite the Catholic health systems under the new name, Providence St. Joseph Health.

Both systems this week signed an official letter of intent.

Providence CEO Rod Hochman will run the combined healthcare provider after the deal concludes, the systems announced.

St. Joseph Health System controls the nonprofit corporations that own and operate several California acute-care facilities, including the 420-bed St. Joseph Hospital of Orange, the 433-bed Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian, and the 299-bed St. Jude Hospital in Fullerton.

Providence Health & Services, meanwhile, oversees the nonprofits in charge of Providence St. Joseph Medical Center, Providence Little Company of Mary Medical Center Torrance, and Providence Holy Cross Medical Center in Mission Hills.
