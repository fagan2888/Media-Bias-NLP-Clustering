MINEOLA, N.Y. (AP) - Two New York men are accused of selling untraceable firearms known as “ghost guns” to undercover investigators.

State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman announced a 32-count indictment was unsealed Monday in a Long Island courtroom against Thomas Weber and Antonio Himonitis. Charges include conspiracy, weapons sales and possession.

Each pleaded not guilty in state Supreme Court in Riverhead. Himonitis was ordered held on $2 million bond. Weber was held on $1 million bond.

Attorney David Levine said Himonitis is looking forward to defending himself against the charges. Weber’s lawyer, Christopher Kirby, declined comment.

Prosecutors say the pair ordered unfinished gun parts from different manufacturers across the country. They are accused of modifying the parts and to make at least a dozen “ghost guns.” The guns were then sold to undercover investigators.
