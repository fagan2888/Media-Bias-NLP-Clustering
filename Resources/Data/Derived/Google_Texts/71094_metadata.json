Turns out, that\u2019s the marketing plan of the President\u2019s Affordable Care Act, otherwise known as Obamacare.\n\nRelated: Obamacare\u2019s $95 Bet on Millennials Buying Insurance\n\nEmily Wright, a 28-year-old from Johnson City, Tenn., signed up for Obamacare one day after the faulty on-line exchange went live last month and is delighted with her decision. While she would like to think of herself as a \u201cyoung invincible,\u201d in fact she has asthma and may require pelvic surgery.\n\nIn contrast, a far more robust Shea Syverson, 26, of Fargo, N.D., decided he can\u2019t afford insurance coverage on his cook\u2019s salary and that it would be a lot cheaper to pay a penalty than to sign on.\n\nJonathan Smarjesse, 29, of Springfield, Ill. who spends his spare time hiking, surfing and cycling, is undecided about whether to sign up.\n\nAsked if the uproar over the slew of technical problems besetting the HealthCare.gov website would be a factor in his decision, Smarjesse is dismissive: \u201cThat stuff doesn\u2019t influence any of my decisions. It\u2019s all math.\u201d\n\nThe Obama administration must convince 2.7 million millennials like Wright, Syverson and Smarjesse to buy health insurance, or the new government exchanges could be a financial bust.\n\nSince the Obamacare website had its technically nightmarish launch Oct. 1, insurers report that insurance buyers have been much older than expected, according to the Wall Street Journal. Without the right mix of young, healthy Americans and older, more infirmed people in the risk pool, insurers could suffer steep losses during the first full year of operation in 2014.\n\nIf that trend continues, the older, more expensive set of customers who are flocking to the website or contacting regional call centers in pursuit of subsidized coverage could drive up premiums for everyone.\n\n\u201cThis was always a dicey situation and now it\u2019s even dicier\u201d for the Obama administration, said Bill Hoagland, a former vice president of giant Cigna Health Insurance, who suspects the administration will fall far short of its goals this year.\n\n\u201cI think the jury is still out,\u201d he added, but the long term picture could be bleak unless signups by younger, healthier Americans picks up substantially.\n\nRelated: Will Millennials Opt Out Of Obamacare At Work?\n\nBecause these younger Americans are usually healthy and rarely rack up huge medical bills, their monthly premiums would make it cheaper for the exchanges to affordably insure 4.3 million other Americans. If you exclude millennials with children\u2014who would likely face stiff medical bills\u2014and those who can stay on their parents\u2019 coverage, the number of \u201celigible\u201d young adults for the exchanges drops to 4 million, according to research by McIntyre and Josh Fangmeier, a consultant for the Center for Healthcare Research & Transformation in Ann Arbor, MI.\n\nA target group as low as 4 million means the Obama administration must convince 67.5 percent of them to buy insurance from an exchange.\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius warned that the numbers to be released next week on the number of Americans who logged on to the website and enrolled for insurance will be \u201clow\u201d because of the technical problems. And insurance companies throughout the country are having far more difficulty recruiting millenials than older Americans, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nOne reason is that older Americans are more patient and willing to spend hours on the website or contacting call centers than younger Americans.\n\nRelated: Why Millennials Are Obamacare\u2019s Last Hope\n\n\u201cObviously, the exchange problems are the first gigantic barrier,\u201d said Joseph Antos, a health care expert with the American Enterprise Institute. \u201cAnd even though young people are far more adept at computer based applications, if the application doesn\u2019t work, that doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\nMoreover, many in their late 20s and early 30s are struggling to find work and have concluded that paying their rent or eating out is more important now than buying insurance.\n\nFinally, many are unfazed by having to pay a tax penalty to the government if they don\u2019t sign up. The first-year penalty would be only $95 or 1 percent of household income. It\u2019s also unclear whether the Internal Revenue Service would ever get around to assessing the penalties. The earliest the IRS could begin identifying scofflaws is the summer of 2015, after all the 2014 tax returns are processed.\n\n\u201cYou have to be able to check who didn\u2019t get insurance, which of course is a non-event, so there\u2019s no documentation,\u201d Antos said. \u201cIn other words, it is practically impossible [for the IRS] to identify those who didn\u2019t buy insurance unless people want to volunteer. But only an idiot would volunteer that he owes you some money \u2013 and young people aren\u2019t that stupid.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The Obama administration must convince 2.7 million millennials like Emily Wright, Shea Syverson and Jonathan Smarjesse to buy health insurance, or the new government exchanges eventually could prove to be a financial bust.
