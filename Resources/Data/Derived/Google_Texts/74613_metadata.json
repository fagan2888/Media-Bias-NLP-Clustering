DAVID YAMAMOTO/SPECIAL TO THE STAR Santa Monica Mountains Park Ranger Michael Liang shows Make-A-Wish recipient Joe Joe Stoop, 6, who is suffering from spinal muscular atrophy, pictures with messages from park rangers from 20 different national parks, Friday as the Make-A-Wish Foundation granted his wish for a toy hauler RV to visit all the national parks with his family.\n\nBy Mark Storer\n\nDianne Sandberg has become good at lying, an odd habit, she admits, for someone of her stature.\n\nSandberg is a wish-granter with the Make-A-Wish Foundation.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve learned to do it, mainly over the phone,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to give away the surprise before it happens.\u201d\n\nHer unique talent was in demand again Friday as she met the Stoop family of Newbury Park: Joe and Jessica and their three children \u2014 Alicia, 7; Josef, who goes by Joe-Joe, 6; and Dominick, 4. Both Joe-Joe and Dominick have spinal muscular atrophy and use motorized wheelchairs.\n\nIt was Joe-Joe\u2019s wish that got Sandberg and a group of wish-granters involved in a two-month process to provide the Stoops with a toy-hauler RV, purchased by Make-A-Wish wish-granters and provided by Barber RV in Ventura.\n\n\u201cThis is really going to give them some freedom to get out as a family and see the world,\u201d said Sandberg. \u201cI\u2019ve got them thinking they\u2019re coming here just to kind of see things and maybe check on a trailer hitch for their truck. I have to keep that illusion up until they get out here.\u201d\n\nOut in the sales lot, Barber RV employees were gathering. All of them had pitched in to donate accessories and items to go with the 23-foot Forest River Stealth toy hauler.\n\n\u201cWe put in some things like fishing rods and a color television,\u201d said Mike Arrambide, sales manager at Barber RV. The trailer has air-conditioning, leather seats, bunk beds, a queen bed and a full bathroom and shower.\n\n\u201cJoe-Joe\u2019s into bugs too, and so we got him a bug collecting kit and some other things,\u201d Arrambide said. \u201cWe\u2019ve done this before. It\u2019s the most heartfelt thing we can do. Joe-Joe wanted to be able to go to all the national parks and camp with his family, and in the van they have, they really couldn\u2019t do that. Now they can.\u201d\n\nMike Liang, park ranger with the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, was on hand to provide Joe-Joe with a lifetime pass to enter any of the national parks. He also gave him a series of photographs and videos made by rangers from 20 different parks, including the Statue of Liberty, Gettysburg, Denali and Joshua Tree.\n\n\u201cPeople with permanent disabilities get these lifetime passes from the parks,\u201d said Liang. \u201cWe\u2019ve always felt that the parks belong to everybody, but they primarily belong to children. It\u2019s an incredible feeling to be involved in something like this.\u201d\n\nAs Joe-Joe and his family came out the door, the staff of more than 30 Barber employees broke into applause and cheered. When the Stoops were presented the toy-hauler trailer and the keys to open and operate it, the parents cried and Joe-Joe was overwhelmed.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m speechless, I\u2019m just boggled,\u201d said Joe Stoop, who works for Home Depot.\n\nJoe-Joe and Dominick turned their chairs to go up the ramp and into the trailer. Joe-Joe smiled wide as he looked around.\n\n\u201cThe first place we\u2019ll go is San Diego,\u201d his father said. \u201cWe\u2019ll try it out. But then Joe-Joe wants to go the Badlands,\u201d in South Dakota.\n\nJoe-Joe\u2019s mom, choking back tears, said she was overwhelmed.\n\n\u201cI had no idea this was going to happen,\u201d she said. \u201cI was waiting, hoping and praying.\u201d\n\nThen she turned and shouted out to the Make-A-Wish and Barber staff:\n\n\u201cYou guys are so awesome!\u201d", "article_metadata": {"title": "Make-A-Wish gives Newbury Park family freedom to travel", "og": {"url": "http://www.vcstar.com/news/local/make-a-wish-gives-newbury-park-family-freedom-to-travel-ep-1240201045-351173911.html", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/makeawish01_23047922_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "height": 427}, "type": "article", "description": "With 2 motorized wheelchairs in the family, a toy-hauler RV means visits to national parks.", "title": "Make-A-Wish gives Newbury Park family freedom to travel"}, "twitter": {"site": "https://twitter.com/vcstar", "image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/makeawish01_23047922_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "description": "With 2 motorized wheelchairs in the family, a toy-hauler RV means visits to national parks.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Make-A-Wish gives Newbury Park family freedom to travel"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-vcs-icon-144.png", "__sync_contentCategory": "premium", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Joe Joe got his wish for a toy hauler RV, provided by Barber RV, to travel with his family to all the national parks.\nDAVID YAMAMOTO/SPECIAL TO THE STAR Make-A-Wish recipient Joe Joe Stoop, 6, who is suffering from spinal muscular atrophy, looks through his toy hauler RV.\n\u201cWe put in some things like fishing rods and a color television,\u201d said Mike Arrambide, sales manager at Barber RV.\nI have to keep that illusion up until they get out here.\u201dOut in the sales lot, Barber RV employees were gathering.\nDAVID YAMAMOTO/SPECIAL TO THE STAR Make-A-Wish Foundation members and Barber RV employees celebrate as Joe Joe Stoop and his family are surprised with Joe Joe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wish Friday, a toy-hauler RV presented by Barber RV in Ventura."}
