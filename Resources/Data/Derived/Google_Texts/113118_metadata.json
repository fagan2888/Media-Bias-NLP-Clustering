It\u2019s ready\u201d \u2014 the Saudi Arabian woman told a Drake University audience last week. \u201cI wasn\u2019t ready.\u201d She was 25, and not interested in giving up her job, car or independent life in Dubai. Nor was she up for the demeaning ritual in which \u201cYou get all dolled up, get on stage and dance at a wedding, and wait for some Mom to see you and say, \u2018She\u2019s good for my son.\u2019 \u201d\n\nInstead, Moharrak climbed Mount Everest. There were smaller mountains first, but the indignation already smoldering in her caught fire after she heard a woman talk about climbing Mount Kilimanjaro, and said she wanted to do it, too. \u201cBut you\u2019re Saudi,\u201d someone replied.\n\nShe spoke last Friday on a panel with other Muslim women athletes from around the world about to embark on RAGBRAI. Moharrak\u2019s father feared she was committing \u201csocial suicide\u201d by climbing. But two years ago, when she became the first Saudi woman to scale Everest, she had her parents\u2019 support. \u201cI stood up there,\u201d she said, \u201cfor every single woman who was told she couldn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nToo many women around the world are still told they can\u2019t. They\u2019re steered away from sports by family, culture, law or restrictions. In Iran, a woman can be arrested for riding a bicycle, as surfer/snowboarder Mona Seraji was. In Saudi Arabia, schoolgirls receive no physical education. Several governments won\u2019t send female athletes to compete internationally or pay for their participation, and women also aren\u2019t eligible for athletic scholarships to finance their education. Some countries, according to the panelists, even censor stories on women in sports, or deny women the right to watch sporting events. All of this makes it a human rights issue.\n\nSports are usually described in terms of their artistry and technique, the ticket sales they generate and the cult-like status of their top-scorers. But for young women denied basic freedoms of movement, dress and self-determination, sports can also be a ticket to freedom and a form of political resistance.\n\nMara Gubuan was thinking about the power of example when the 1983 Urbandale High School graduate \u2014 who is not Muslim \u2014 imagined organizing Muslim women from around the world to ride RAGBRAI. She wanted it to inspire other Muslim girls as well as show everyone Muslim women not as oppressed, but as accomplished athletes. In honor of their 50th birthdays, Gubuan and former classmates formed a RAGBRAI team. Through donations to her nonprofit organization, Shirzanan (Persian for female hero), money was raised to bring in Muslim women athletes to ride with them.\n\nGubuan teamed up with Solmaz Sharif, who became a sports reporter at 17 in Iran. Denied the right to start a women\u2019s sports magazine there, she launched one online after moving to America in 2007. It got 6 million hits in two years. Her organization, Non-Stop Media, is the parent company for this endeavor, which will be the subject of a movie. (Donations are still welcome.)\n\nSome on Team Shirzanan wear make up and sleeveless dresses and keep their long hair down. Others cover theirs in scarves and have long sleeves. All share a commitment to women\u2019s right to pursue sports on their terms.\n\nHajar Abulfazl of Afghanistan plays soccer, and though she says most Afghans don\u2019t approve, she sees it as a ticket to world travel. Egyptian Rehab Shawky began riding bicycles in Cairo 10 years ago and said the hostile reactions worsened after the 2011 uprisings. Jordanian Amani Ammoura faced a lot of opposition as a bicycle rider there, but was spotted and invited to compete. Last year she placed third in a 100-kilometer race.\n\nPakistan\u2019s first female international swimmer, Kiran Khan, was trained by her father, who swam professionally for Pakistan and encouraged her to take up sports to handle her \u201canger.\u201d But advancing to competitive levels, she found Pakistan didn\u2019t take women\u2019s sports seriously, had no female coaches and sponsors for female athletes. After age 12, she says boys and girls weren\u2019t even allowed to swim together in Lahore, where she lives. So she cut her long hair and dressed as a boy. Still, she says, \u201cThere\u2019s a new hurdle every day.\u201d\n\nKhan has since built two swimming pools and two gyms for females.\n\nAs a child, Soolmaz Abooali watched \u201cAmerican Ninja\u201d on TV, and was taken by the U.S. Marine protecting the country through martial arts. So she discovered karate, becoming a 10-time champion. She and her family left Iran as refugees, eventually settling in the United States. She says karate can fortify young people to fight gang recruitment, low self-esteem and negative body image.\n\nKulsoom Abdullah, a Pakistani champion weight lifter and engineer, lives in Atlanta. She took up the sport to get strong. But she faced hurdles when the U.S. weight-lifting organization wouldn\u2019t accept the long-sleeve shirts, pants and hijab she wore in lieu of a singlet. She learned that as a private organization, it could do that. But after she issued a press release saying she couldn\u2019t compete as a Muslim woman, the weight lifting federation allowed her to represent Pakistan in international competition.\n\nIranian Seraji surfs in hijab. Introduced to skiing at eight by her mother, she became a snowboarder. But in 2013 she broke her spine in a ski jumping accident and is now a snowboard instructor. \u201cMy goal,\u201d she says of the dearth of female coaches, \u201cis to find a little girl and coach her to the Olympics.\u201d\n\nBicycle riding was considered immoral for girls in late 19th century America. Today in some countries, athletics are said to be not feminine or too risky or revealing. But the real reason for keeping them away seems to be that they\u2019re too empowering. Once you believe you can master tough physical challenges, you might come to see yourself as the driver of your own fate in all the other ways.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://dmreg.co/1MLEbLn", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Young women denied basic freedoms and self-determination, sports can be a ticket to freedom.", "p": {"domain_verify": "372c291dc2b106308d26264f4fba3b10"}, "og": {"site_name": "Des Moines Register", "description": "Young women denied basic freedoms and self-determination, sports can be a ticket to freedom.", "title": "Muslim women find empowerment through competitive sports", "url": "http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/opinion/columnists/rekha-basu/2015/07/24/muslim-women-empowerment-sports-basu/30592625/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/desmoinesregister.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Young women denied basic freedoms and self-determination, sports can be a ticket to freedom.", "title": "Muslim women find empowerment through competitive sports", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0c1a98c2d9233baecbcb3697ec4ff9e4fbfcf00b/c=617-0-3815-3198&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/07/23/DesMoines/B9318196654Z.1_20150723183758_000_G40BE85OT.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@DMRegister", "site": "@DMRegister", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600025120", "fb": {"app_id": 169766623060429}, "viewport": "width=1070", "article": {"author": "http://www.facebook.com/rekha.basu1106"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Places/Mount Everest", "gci-asset-type": "data", "gci-categories": "Places/Mount Everest", "title": "Muslim women find empowerment through competitive sports", "author": "Rekha Basu", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "opinion/columnists/rekha-basu", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/84d04dbe56387986676d9e7d6bf542ffe5013627/c=1017-0-3415-3198/local/-/media/2015/07/23/DesMoines/B9318196654Z.1_20150723183758_000_G40BE85OT.1-0.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/169d1a5fa19a46c8ce5f814b672349d61ba25e53/c=617-0-3815-3198/local/-/media/2015/07/23/DesMoines/B9318196654Z.1_20150723183758_000_G40BE85OT.1-0.jpg", "contenttype": "data", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4cb63426d665135741291a8a151ecc4b480f65c8/c=84-0-4348-3198/local/-/media/2015/07/23/DesMoines/B9318196654Z.1_20150723183758_000_G40BE85OT.1-0.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/aa884488e5dffd48eae84383f216294339d8446a/c=0-352-4432-2845&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2015/07/23/DesMoines/B9318196654Z.1_20150723183758_000_G40BE85OT.1-0.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-07-23T23:09:56.860000-05:00", "shorthed": "Muslim women empowered by athletics", "articleid": 30592625, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/edccbb1e3d1c2517358bdf6a2f256013118243c3/c=0-352-4432-2845/local/-/media/2015/07/23/DesMoines/B9318196654Z.1_20150723183758_000_G40BE85OT.1-0.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8546bbd43489c4741a262c65c7487983f7be86a7/c=1316-0-3115-3198/local/-/media/2015/07/23/DesMoines/B9318196654Z.1_20150723183758_000_G40BE85OT.1-0.jpg"}}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe174a\"", "article_summary": "She wanted it to inspire other Muslim girls as well as show everyone Muslim women not as oppressed, but as accomplished athletes.\nShe spoke last Friday on a panel with other Muslim women athletes from around the world about to embark on RAGBRAI.\nThrough donations to her nonprofit organization, Shirzanan (Persian for female hero), money was raised to bring in Muslim women athletes to ride with them.\nBoth athletes are riding their first RAGBRAI with Team Shirzanan, which includes several female Muslim athletes from around the world.\nMara Gubuan was thinking about the power of example when the 1983 Urbandale High School graduate \u2014 who is not Muslim \u2014 imagined organizing Muslim women from around the world to ride RAGBRAI."}
