Bill Galvano, R-Bradenton, won\u2019t become Senate president for four more years, his status as a rising power carries perks and a tremendous influence that the region has not seen in years.\n\nOne gauge of that power: money. Consider that Galvano has run a political action committee called Innovate Florida since 2006, one that raised less than $90,000 per year for its first seven years.\n\nBut since the start of 2014, when he secured the pledges necessary for a future Senate presidency, Galvano has raised just over $1 million from an array of powerful industries seeking to influence the legislative process.\n\nFlorida Power & Light, U.S. Sugar Corp., Disney Worldwide and even real estate tycoon Donald Trump have donated tens of thousands to Galvano\u2019s fund, all in hopes that it will put them on good terms with the future leader.\n\nThe Session Ahead\n\nWhy so much money?\n\nA Senate president helps dictate the statewide legislative agenda, determines committee memberships and rewards or punishes special interests as few in Tallahassee can. And because of term limits, which gives lawmakers a limited period in which to make their mark, power flows to the leaders in waiting, as well as those currently in authority.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s going to be great for our community,\u201d state Rep. Jim Boyd, R-Bradenton, said of Galvano\u2019s growing clout.\n\nGalvano, a lawyer, recognizes the potential. He said that sure, he\u2019ll keep an eye out for the region when the state budget is being built this year. But Galvano, 48, also has ideas of using his influence in another way, one that speaks to how he has tried to model himself after political idol Abraham Lincoln.\n\nSpeaking to a room full of the area\u2019s biggest business leaders last week in Sarasota, Galvano made the obligatory GOP references to cutting taxes and doling out economic incentive money in the name of job creation.\n\nBut most of the rest of his speech focused on two issues rarely seen atop the legislative agenda: mental health funding and the developmentally disabled.\n\nGalvano told the 120 business leaders that whether they want to believe it, failing to properly address mental health in Florida affects them because of its spillover into other parts of life.\n\n\u201cThe reason I\u2019m a Republican is a because of Abraham Lincoln,\u201d Galvano said. \u201cHe had a simple formula. He said the role of government is to do for those who cannot do for themselves or cannot do well for themselves.\n\n\u201cEverything else is fluff.\u201d\n\nLegislature 2015: The Issues\n\nGalvano said he has a clear measuring stick for judging legislative success.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re able to help the mentally ill, the elderly, the children who have no means of protection in certain circumstances, if that is what we able do, then we\u2019ve fulfilled the role of government,\u201d he said.\n\nOther key players\n\nWhile Galvano is unquestionably the most influential Florida legislator from this region, the delegation has other key players who will influence some of the session\u2019s hottest issues. On medical marijuana, alcohol regulations, tourism funding, tax incentive policies and the environment, Sarasota and Manatee will have plenty of impact.\n\nHere is a ranking of the region\u2019s delegation from the least influential to the most, and the issues on which they are likely to have the most sway:\n\n7. Rep. Darryl Rouson, D-St. Petersburg\n\nPersonal: 59, attorney\n\nKey position: Top Democrat on Justice Appropriations Subcommittee.\n\nWhy he\u2019s important: There may be no one in the legislative process more dedicated to making sure people in prison have a chance at rehabilitation. In his role on the Justice Appropriations, Rouson has sought more funding to help inmates in various ways, including getting substance abuse services.\n\nBill to watch:\n\nHB 149 \u2014 Grandparent rights. The bill would allow grandparents a chance to petition a court for visitation of minors in cases in which one parent of the child has died, is missing or is in a vegetative state.\n\nMedicaid expansion \u2014 There is no bill number, but if the House revives a plan to expand Medicaid to more than 800,000 Floridians without health care coverage, Rouson, a strong orator, will be in the middle of the debate.\n\n6. Rep. Julio Gonzalez, R-Venice\n\nPersonal: 50, orthopedic surgeon\n\nKey position: Health Quality Subcommittee\n\nWhy he\u2019s important: As one of just two doctors in the House, Gonzalez already is showing he\u2019s going to use his voice to influence public policy in the medical profession.\n\nBills to watch:\n\nHB 697 \u2014 Public health. Gonzalez\u2019s proposal would ensure that people exposed to communicable diseases can be quarantined upon arriving in Florida. It\u2019s a response to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, part of efforts to keep returning people from spreading the disease.\n\nHB 147 \u2014 Abortion. Gonzalez is a key co-sponsor of this legislation, which would ban doctors from performing abortions unless their clinics are within 30 miles of a hospital in which they have admitting privileges. A similar bill in Texas has been identified as having closed half of that state\u2019s abortion clinics.\n\n5. Rep. Ray Pilon, R-Sarasota\n\nPersonal: 70, retired sheriff\u2019s deputy\n\nKey position: Vice chairman of Agriculture and Natural Resources Appropriations Subcommittee.\n\nWhy he\u2019s important: Pilon is a former lobbyist with the Peace River-Manasota Regional Water Supply Authority, which gives him insight on water policy issues.\n\nBill to watch:\n\nHB 1 \u2014 Texting while driving. Pilon\u2019s bill would double fines for anyone caught texting while driving in a school zone or at a school crossing.\n\n4. Rep. Greg Steube, R-Sarasota\n\nPersonal: 36, attorney\n\nKey position: Chairman of the Highway and Waterway Safety Subcommittee\n\nWhy he\u2019s important: Steube has spearheaded legislation to help craft beer brewers and pro-gun measures, including a bill allowing some college students to carry weapons on campus. He\u2019s also in the center of an effort to legalize medical marijuana for people suffering from cancer and other illnesses.\n\nBills to watch:\n\nHB 19 \u2014 School safety. Steube\u2019s bill would allow a superintendent to designate school personnel to carry guns on campuses if they are veterans or former law enforcement, to provide added protection in the event of a shooter on the premises.\n\nHB 4005 \u2014 Concealed weapons. Would allow college students who are licensed to have a concealed weapon to bring those firearms on campus.\n\n3. Rep. Jim Boyd\n\nPersonal: 58, insurance\n\nKey Positions: Vice chairman of Appropriations; Deputy majority leader and majority whip\n\nWhy he\u2019s important: The region\u2019s most important House member. Boyd has been the go-to lawmaker in drafting controversial bills dealing with insurance, elections and public pensions over the last few years. It shows Boyd is one of the most trusted members of the Legislature and will have influence on a host of issues.\n\nBill to watch:\n\nAmendment 1 implementation \u2014 In November, voters approved a constitutional amendment to require that a third of fees collected from documentary-stamp taxes on real estate transactions be spent on environmental conservation. Boyd has been enlisted to oversee implementation of the amendment in the House.\n\n2. Sen. Nancy Detert\n\nPersonal: 70, former mortgage broker\n\nKey position: Chairwoman of the Senate Commerce and Tourism Committee.\n\nWhy she\u2019s important: Besides being the gatekeeper for various tax and tourism policies on her main committee, Detert has become a respected voice on reforming the child welfare system and the Department of Children and Families.\n\nBills to watch:\n\nSB 1046 \u2014 Film incentives. Detert has filed legislation to reform policy on film incentive money in a bid to attract more studios to make projects in Florida. Detert says the film incentives have historically produced a better return on investment than funding for sports.\n\nSB 318 \u2014 Elder guardianship. This bill would require a hearing prior to placing people in the elder guardianship system when they are deemed too frail or mentally compromised to make decisions for themselves. Detert is a co-sponsor, and she fears seniors are being locked away in institutions and having assets seized without due process.\n\n1. Sen. Bill Galvano\n\nPersonal: 48, attorney\n\nKey position: Senate majority leader, future Senate president\n\nWhy he\u2019s important: As a Senate leader, Galvano will have influence in helping craft the chamber\u2019s overall agenda. He has stated a priority will be improving mental health services in Florida and expanding programs for the developmentally disabled.\n\nBills to watch:\n\nGambling compact. This year the Legislature is scheduled to determine whether to let the Seminole Tribe continue operating high-stakes card games, and whether to allow more gambling in the state. Galvano could was the lead negotiator in devising the gaming compact when he was in the Florida House in 2010.\n\nMedicaid expansion. Galvano strongly supports a renewed bid to expand Medicaid under the federal Affordable Care Act to cover more than 800,000 low-income Floridians. He said expanding the program would cover the state as the federal government decreases federal funding for low-income assistance to help hospitals pay for care for the uninsured.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://politics.heraldtribune.com/files/2015/03/sdelegation02galvpol.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}, "description": "Sarasota and Manatee have one of the most potent delegations of the past 15 years.", "framework": "Alkivia Framework 0.8"}, "article_summary": "Why he\u2019s important: Pilon is a former lobbyist with the Peace River-Manasota Regional Water Supply Authority, which gives him insight on water policy issues.\nWhy he\u2019s important: There may be no one in the legislative process more dedicated to making sure people in prison have a chance at rehabilitation.\nRep.
