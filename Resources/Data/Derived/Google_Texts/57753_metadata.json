After all the recent troubles conservatives have had with \u201cObamacare victims\u201d in attack ads that turned out to be wrong, the Koch-financed Americans for Prosperity wouldn\u2019t push its luck with another dubious commercial, would it?\n\nOf course it would.\n\nConservative group Americans for Prosperity launched a $700,000 ad campaign targeting Sen. Mark Pryor (D., Ark.) for his support of the Affordable Care Act. The ad, which will be broadcast statewide beginning Thursday and running for the next three weeks, brings the group\u2019s total spending on the Senate race to more than $1.3 million. In the ad, a woman identified as Wanda of Marion, Ark., says Blue Cross Blue Shield notified her and her husband that their health coverage would be canceled as of December 2014. \u201cWell now, when somebody tells you if you like it, you can keep it, you believe them,\u201d she says, referring to remarks President Barack Obama made when he was touting the health care law. \u201cBut that\u2019s not so in this case.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s worth emphasizing that the pushback against deceptive advertising from the Affordable Care Act\u2019s foes appear to have had some effect \u2013 this new AFP spot is more restrained than many of its predecessors. (Unlike the recent Michigan attack , this one doesn\u2019t falsely suggest the health care law will endanger the lives of cancer patients.)\n\nIndeed, it was of great interest to see that this Arkansas spot steers clear of many factual claims that would draw the scrutiny of fact-checkers. The woman in the ad, for example, doesn\u2019t mention whether or not she\u2019s saving money, or whether she\u2019s any worse off than before.\n\nThe offensive is more straightforward: Wanda had one health plan and now she\u2019s complaining about getting a new plan. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s the attack.\n\nBut as is too often the case with these ads, there are some problems with the basics in the AFP\u2019s new spot.\n\nFirst, we learned after the ad was launched that neither Wanda nor anyone else in Arkansas is actually having their plans canceled under \u201cObamacare.\u201d\n\nThe problem is that earlier this month, the Arkansas Insurance Department released a bulletin explaining that the state\u2019s insurance providers could follow a recently announced federal change that would allow people with non-compliant plans to stay on them as late as October 2017. Heather Haywood, a public information manager with the state\u2019s insurance department, elaborated upon the change in an email to The Huffington Post Thursday. \u201cInsurance carriers sent notifications to consumers that coverage under health policies that did not comply with the ACA, would end December 2014,\u201d Haywood wrote. \u201cPursuant to the March 5 CCIIO Bulletin \u2013 extension of transitional policy through October 1, 2016 \u2013 Arkansas Insurance Commissioner [Jay] Bradford issued AID Bulletin 6-2014 extending coverage through October 1, 2016.\u201d\n\nThe total number of Arkansans whose health plans have been canceled as a result of the Affordable Care Act? According to the Wall Street Journal\u2019s tally, the answer is zero\n\nIn other words, the premise of this simple attack ad is at odds with reality.\n\nMaking matters slightly worse is the larger context. Americans for Prosperity is running this misleading commercial, arguing that the health care reform law is leading to Arkansans losing coverage they may like. At the exact same time, as Brian Beutler noted , Americans for Prosperity is urging state policymakers to take away coverage for Arkansans who have coverage they may like.\n\nThe Koch-backed group has been more relentless in its efforts to block the Affordable Care Act\u2019s Medicaid expansion than just about any advocacy organization. And in Arkansas, where this ad is on the air, the group pushed hard for the state to reverse its Medicaid expansion, which would have canceled coverage for the 100,000 people who had already signed up in the state.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "After all the recent troubles conservatives have had with \"Obamacare victims,\" AFP wouldn't air another dubious commercial, right?
