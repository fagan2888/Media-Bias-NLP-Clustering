Hellerstedt, Life News\n\nEarlier this month, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in Whole Woman\u2019s Health v. Hellerstedt, the first major abortion case to reach the Supreme Court in almost a decade. The Supreme Court will be considering whether the requirements for facilities that provide abortions in Texas are unreasonably restrictive, but the same bill aims to ban all abortions after 20 weeks, with an exception only for fetal anomalies that are considered \u201cincompatible with life,\u201d a deceptively complicated designation that may not provide either legal protection or clarity to parents forced to make difficult decisions regarding a wide range of serious fetal anomalies, many of which are not discoverable until close to that 20 week cutoff. This case, along with, the new vacancy on the Supreme Court following the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, and the presidential primaries, has thrust the abortion debate back into the national spotlight. Abortions performed due to fetal anomalies, and late-term abortions generally, represent a minority of abortions performed in this country. But much of the recent legislation regarding abortion around the country targets or impacts this subset of cases specifically, and these new laws threaten to do grave harm.\n\nAnother state law currently being debated in Ohio would prohibit abortion at any gestational age whenever a diagnosis of Down syndrome has been made, and the state\u2019s governor, the presidential candidate John Kasich, has stated publicly that were the bill to reach his desk, he would not hesitate to sign it into law. An even more restrictive bill has just been passed by the Indiana state Legislature, prohibiting abortion in the case of \u201ca diagnosis or potential diagnosis of Down Syndrome or any other disability,\u201d a shockingly broad category that ironically does nothing to address abortions of healthy fetuses. These bills have the potential to create serious socioeconomic disparities, as women with the resources to do so will almost certainly travel across state lines to obtain abortions when that is the medical decision they have made.\n\nIn all of these cases, it is taken for granted that the idea of viability \u2013 the point in a pregnancy at which the fetus has a reasonable chance of surviving outside the uterus when supported by modern medicine \u2013 provides a useful guidepost for making ethical policy decisions. Think about a perfectly healthy fetus who is old enough that, if born at that very moment, he or she would in all likelihood thrive with the support of the appropriate neonatal intensive care. The idea of injecting potassium chloride directly into that fetus\u2019s heart is distressing enough that it ought to give even the most staunchly pro-choice advocate pause. Then, think instead about a fetus of the same gestational age who has a severe abnormality \u2013 a heart, say, that is essentially missing one of its chambers, or a diaphragm with a hole so large all of the contents of the abdomen are up in the chest compressing the lungs. In cases like this, in which survival would require extensive intervention with uncertain outcomes and a risk-benefit profile that cannot be universally agreed upon, the concept of viability based on arbitrary gestational age cutoffs quickly starts to break down.\n\nAt the beginning of my fourth year of medical school, I had an abortion, an experience about which I have written previously in detail. At the time, we had a 2-year-old daughter, and we found out during our routine anatomy scan around 19 weeks that the baby boy I was carrying had a severe disease. His kidneys were irreversibly damaged, and as a result, his lungs could not develop properly. No one could predict whether he would die during the pregnancy, shortly after birth, or perhaps survive into childhood if he received neonatal dialysis and qualified for a kidney transplant in the future. For us, the risk of prolonged suffering, pain and grave disability \u2013 a kidney transplant at best has a lifespan of 20 years \u2013 outweighed the possibility of what we considered to be meaningful quality of life, and we chose to terminate the pregnancy. Preventing our baby\u2019s suffering is a motivation that most can relate to even if they disagree with our ultimate choice. But the aspect of our decision that is harder to talk about \u2013 because as mothers, specifically, we are still widely expected to sacrifice everything in the interest of our children \u2013 is the fact that we also took into account what it might mean for our careers, for our growing family, and for the trajectory of our lives, if we chose to carry the pregnancy to term.\n\nLate-term abortion and abortion for fetal anomalies are hard to talk about. For many moderates, the idea of simply limiting abortions to the first half of pregnancy, or to undoubtedly lethal conditions only \u2013 a surprisingly difficult prediction to make, as I will discuss later \u2013 seems like a reasonable and fair compromise. Don\u2019t we have to draw the line somewhere, or else run the risk of allowing unrestrained euthanasia? Absolutist opponents of abortion often point to perinatal hospice and adoption as the morally acceptable alternatives, while unconditional proponents of abortion rights often shy away from the topic entirely, perhaps because it raises questions about a fetus\u2019s perceived humanity and potential human rights that are conveniently avoided if one accepts the formulation that life begins only when the fetus reaches the point of viability.\n\nThe problem with all of these arguments, and with the legislation around the country that speaks in broad strokes about \u201cviability,\u201d \u201clethal\u201d anomalies, and \u201cprotecting women and children,\u201d is that these simple \u201cpolitical\u201d concepts are surprisingly resistant to having any serious medical, ethical or practical meanings. We are now so good at \u201csaving\u201d babies, and yet still so bad at having frank discussions, even within the medical community, about quality of life and the limits of medicine, that what gets lost in the middle is the fundamental rights and interests of the women, families and children who are at the center of these stories.\n\nAs a pediatrician-in-training and now the mother of three healthy daughters, I think frequently about our son, and the decision we made. One of the first patients I took care of as a resident was a toddler whose prenatal diagnosis was eerily parallel to our son\u2019s. Every morning when I walked into his room to examine him and see how his night had been, I would see his tiny body curled up in the hospital crib, his G-tube hooked up to continuous feeds. I would see his mother sleeping on the fold-out chair underneath a scratchy hospital sheet, and I would wonder what it would be like if it were my son in that crib, if it were me sleeping on the makeshift bed. I can\u2019t pretend to know anything about that mother\u2019s beliefs or the decisions she made while pregnant, about the dreams and plans she had for her boy\u2019s future, or about how her life may have changed when she took on her role as his mother and protector, always by his side. What was obvious, though, was that she loved her son dearly, just as I would have loved our son had he been born. When I think about our son, I wonder what color his soft, sweet hair would have been, and I check the perpetually running calendar in my mind to see how old he would be today. I wonder if, had we continued the pregnancy, I would be here in this hospital room as a resident or as a mother; if I would have quit my medical training entirely, a path that was already challenging enough with a young daughter and a husband with a busy career.", "article_metadata": {"description": "I chose not to bring my son to term.
