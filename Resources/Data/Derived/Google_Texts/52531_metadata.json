The public slate of events seemed to kick off with a rather defiant statement\n\nAs a side note, I\u2019ll just add that I found the very first response to that particular tweet pretty amusing.\n\nmaybe she has another job lined up already.\n\n\u2013 Valarie Vivino\n\nSome of the burgeoning confidence may have been a bit misplaced, though. It wasn\u2019t long after that when the AP dropped some new numbers in her in basket which couldn\u2019t have helped with digesting lunch.\n\nSupport for U.S. Sen. Mary Landrieu in Louisiana has dropped in a new poll amid the problem-plagued rollout of the federal health care overhaul, which could suggest trouble for the Democratic senator\u2019s re-election bid next year. The third-term senator has regularly polled with approval ratings well above 50 percent, but a survey released Thursday by Southern Media and Opinion Research showed approval of Landrieu\u2019s job performance had deteriorated to 46 percent. Nearly 51 percent said they thought she wasn\u2019t doing a good job. In another possible blow, 54 percent of those polled said they\u2019d be less likely to vote for the Democratic senator\u2019s re-election next year because of her vote for President Barack Obama\u2019s signature health law. Landrieu has maintained her strong support of the federal law.\n\nThe number of people supporting her reelection has dropped from above the critical 50% mark to 41% in barely a month, and you simply can\u2019t discount the timing of the Obamacare roll-out with this as coincidence. The specifics in this latest round of polling get even worse for her.\n\n\u2013 \u201cFifty-four percent of those polled said they\u2019d be less likely to vote for the Democratic senator\u2019s re-election next year because of her vote for President Barack Obama\u2019s health law.\u201d \u2013 Her \u201cgood\u201d ratings dropped by 14 points (from 44-30%). Her negative job ratings went up 10 points with most being an increase in \u201cpoor\u201d ratings (up 7 points). \u2013 Landrieu lost ground among male and female white Democrats. Her positive job ratings dropped 17 points among while male Democrats and 19 points among white female Democrats. \u2013 70% of undecideds said they would be less likely to vote for Landrieu because she supported ObamaCare. \u2013 When voters were asked what was more important, Landrieu\u2019s seniority or electing someone new, 56-37% said electing someone new.\n\nIf the voters are truly feeling that way, they may want to recall what Senator Landrieu said only last month.\n\n\u201c\u2026.We did not wake up one morning and declare this the law. The people of the United States declared this through us as their Representatives. If they do not like it, they can unelect us. Believe me, they will have a great chance because I am up for reelection right now. They will be able to do that. But that is the way you do it.\u201d\n\nSay\u2026 that\u2019s some pretty solid thinking. I may not often agree with Landrieu, but I must admit that she may be on to something there.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Sounds like a plan, Senator", "title": "Landrieu: Hey, if you don\u2019t like Obamacare, you can unelect me", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2013/11/23/landrieu-hey-if-you-dont-like-obamacare-you-can-unelect-me/", "image": {"width": 497, "identifier": "http://media.hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/LandrieuNotWorried.jpg", "height": 262}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "keywords": "2014 election, Louisiana, Mary Landrieu, ObamaCare, US Senate,", "article": {"published_time": "2013-11-23T19:31:47+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-23T14:37:27+00:00"}, "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd93e\"", "article_summary": "If the voters are truly feeling that way, they may want to recall what Senator Landrieu said only last month.\nHer positive job ratings dropped 17 points among while male Democrats and 19 points among white female Democrats.\nHer negative job ratings went up 10 points with most being an increase in \u201cpoor\u201d ratings (up 7 points).\n\u2013 70% of undecideds said they would be less likely to vote for Landrieu because she supported ObamaCare.\nI may not often agree with Landrieu, but I must admit that she may be on to something there."}
