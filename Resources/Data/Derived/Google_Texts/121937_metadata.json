As if there couldn\u2019t be another reason or for that matter, dozens of other reasons like\u2026\n\n\u00b7 The IRS scandal\n\n\u00b7 Obamacare\n\n\u00b7 Fast and Furious\n\n\u00b7 Opening up the borders and illegally implementing the DREAM ACT\n\n\u00b7 Lying about being opposed to gay marriage in 2008 and then supporting it later\n\n\u00b7 Refusing to turn away flights from nations with Ebola\n\n\u00b7 Killing NASA\u2019s manned space program\n\n\u00b7 Losing America\u2019s AAA credit rating\n\n\u00b7 Helping radical Islamists take over in Libya and Egypt\n\n\u00b7 His obnoxious bowing to other world leaders\n\n\u00b7 His doing nothing of consequence to stop Iran from getting nuclear weapons\n\n\u00b7 Cash-for-Clunkers\n\n\u00b7 Benghazi\n\n\u00b7 1 out of every 5 Americans is on food stamps thanks to Obama\n\n\u00b7 Going to war multiple times without congressional approval\n\n\u00b7 Creating the rise of ISIS in Iraq by not leaving American troops there\n\n\u00b7 Losing the fight against ISIS\n\n\u00b7 Losing the war in Afghanistan\n\n\u00b7 He\u2019s a gun grabber\n\n\u00b7 Illegally bypassing Congress many times with overreaching, unconstitutional executive orders\n\n\u00b7 Trading Taliban terrorists for deserter Bowe Bergdahl\n\n\u00b7 Wasting billions to bail out his union allies at General Motors and the now Italian owned Chrysler\n\n\u00b7 His nearly trillion dollar failed stimulus program\n\n\u00b7 Increasing the debt from $10.6 trillion when he took office to $17.8 trillion today\n\n\u2026.and the sad thing is, this isn\u2019t even remotely close to a comprehensive list of Obama\u2019s scandals, corruptions, stupidities and lawlessness. It\u2019s just that reciting the sheer number of poor decisions and bad policy choices that Obama has made would cause people to mentally check out, like they do when they\u2019re trying to wrap their minds around the almost unimaginable size of the national debt.\n\nIn fact, other than not stopping SEAL Team 6 from killing Osama Bin Laden, conservatives have disagreed with Obama on almost every significant decision of his presidency. When it matters, he either does nothing when he needs to do something, does something when he should be doing nothing or just plain old does the worst thing possible.\n\nTo top it all off, Obama doesn\u2019t have that frustrating naivet\u00e9 of Jimmy Carter or that \u201cWell, he might be a jackass, but he\u2019d probably be fun to chat with over a burger\u201d charm of Bill Clinton.\n\nObama is both shockingly incompetent AND toweringly arrogant. He\u2019s both habitually ineffective and habitually condescending. The man lies as often as a professional con man, but is so used to having his bumbling excused that he\u2019s not even good at lying.\n\nCertainly Obama would be more tolerable if he were called out for his screw-ups by his supporters, but he\u2019s like the stereotypical no-good rich kid who gets away with being a punk because his dad is wealthy and owns the only factory in town. There are liberals who support Obama because he\u2019s a liberal. There are Democrats who support Obama because he\u2019s a Democrat. There are black Americans who support him because he\u2019s black. But, there\u2019s almost no one giving any sort of defense of Obama based on his doing a good job or because he\u2019s actually helping the country. In fact, there\u2019s very little defense of Obama at all anymore; there are just attacks on his political enemies, bald faced lies that even his own supporters have trouble swallowing, and excuses.\n\nOh, and are there excuses.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s George Bush\u2019s fault! The Republicans won\u2019t do what I want! Sarah Palin said this! Rush Limbaugh said that! The media doesn\u2019t support me enough. We didn\u2019t add more jobs because it was cold this winter!\u201d\n\nWhat exactly does Obama ever do right? Certainly not the economy since there are fewer Americans working today than the day he took office. How about the fight against ISIS which we\u2019re currently losing? How\u2019d the roll-out of Obamacare work out? Did everyone who liked his plan get to keep his plan? What do we have to show for all the money Obama spent on the stimulus? Did he ever get to the bottom of the IRS scandal?\n\nOn second thought, does Obama ever get to the bottom of ANY scandal? Nixon was a choirboy compared to Obama and if we\u2019re being perfectly honest about it, the only reason Obama hasn\u2019t been impeached is because Americans don\u2019t want to impeach the first black President. For all the talk about \u201cracism\u201d that we\u2019ve heard, Obama\u2019s race has been his #1 asset. He was elected and re-elected despite not being qualified for the job because he is black, he\u2019s been treated with kid gloves by the press even for a Democrat because he\u2019s black and the only reason he\u2019s avoiding impeachment at this point is because he\u2019s black. That\u2019s a pretty big comedown from the high hopes so many Americans had after the first black President was elected. Obama\u2019s election was going to be the exclamation point that proved America had gotten beyond race and instead, it turned out that the Jackie Robinson of the Presidency was the worst player to ever walk on the field and it was easier for his fans to blame \u201cracism\u201d than admit it.\n\nWhat it comes down to is that Obama isn\u2019t just a blithering, bumbling Barney Fife without the charm. He\u2019s dishonest, corrupt, narcissistic \u2013 and, no, he doesn\u2019t \u201cmean well.\u201d He doesn\u2019t seem to give a flat damn about the country, the American people or anything other than glorifying himself and his ideology. He\u2019s a vainglorious bush leaguer who was never worthy of the presidency in the first place and who views the American people as his servants instead of viewing himself as a servant of the people. That makes him a bad President. That makes him dangerous. That makes him a bad guy.", "article_metadata": {"description": "We keep hearing from liberals that people who oppose Barack Obama MUST feel that way because of racism..05/26/2016 1:06:41AM EST.", "author": "John Hawkins", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "We keep hearing from liberals that people who oppose Barack Obama MUST feel that way because of racism.", "title": "John Hawkins - Why I Oppose Barack Obama", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/johnhawkins/2014/10/18/why-i-oppose-barack-obama-n1906802", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/290/5086d9b9-6f1d-467f-96a1-f42ee5ef00d8.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "We keep hearing from liberals that people who oppose Barack Obama MUST feel that way because of racism.", "title": "John Hawkins - Why I Oppose Barack Obama", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/johnhawkins/2014/10/18/why-i-oppose-barack-obama-n1906802", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/290/5086d9b9-6f1d-467f-96a1-f42ee5ef00d8.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Why I Oppose Barack Obama, John Hawkins, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3d0d\"", "article_summary": "We keep hearing from liberals that people who oppose Barack Obama MUST feel that way because of racism.\nWe didn\u2019t add more jobs because it was cold this winter!\u201dWhat exactly does Obama ever do right?\nOn second thought, does Obama ever get to the bottom of ANY scandal?\nThere are Democrats who support Obama because he\u2019s a Democrat.\nThere are liberals who support Obama because he\u2019s a liberal."}
