The way bitcoin and its ecosystem react to the problems could determine whether the whole experiment goes the way of Dutch tulips in the 1600s or becomes a historic technological breakthrough like email.\n\nTo recap: Bitcoin is a virtual or \u201ccrypto\u201d currency. It isn\u2019t backed by governments or central banks and it exists only online. In fact, it is so \u201ccrypto\u201d that nobody knows who developed it.\n\nThere is no mint either. Users \u201cmine\u201d bitcoins by using computer algorithms to solve complex mathematical problems. They trade the coins among themselves or spend them on things like tickets to Sacramento Kings basketball games, or at online retailer Overstock.com.\n\nOver the past three years, bitcoin has emerged from geekland into the mainstream. Its price skyrocketed from a few cents in 2011 to a high of more than $1,100 in December 2013. More and more merchants started accepting it. And its most ardent friends and foes even predicted that it might one day replace the dollar and other traditional currencies.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s strength is predicated on three supposed qualities: It is anonymous, or at least pseudonymous (transactions are recorded but the identity of the parties is encrypted); it is difficult to hack; and it cuts out financial middlemen like banks.\n\nMeyer Malka, whose venture-capital fund Ribbit Capital invests in bitcoin-related firms, calls virtual currencies \u201cthe most disruptive thing I have seen in financial services in my lifetime.\u201d\n\nOf late, though, bitcoin\u2019s three bulwarks have come under fire. Its anonymity has caught the attention of regulators and law-enforcement agencies because of alleged money laundering. Its immunity to cyberattacks was called into question last week when the three main bitcoin exchanges had severe problems. And the currency\u2019s place on the fringes of the financial system has proved a limitation because most banks refuse to facilitate bitcoin transactions. To make matter worse, bitcoin\u2019s price now is almost half of what it was at its peak.\n\nAjay Banga, chief executive of Mastercard, spoke for many skeptics last week when he said in an interview: \u201cThe world is not short of currencies, so what is this currency solving for?\u201d\n\nThat is the crucial question. In order to thrive, bitcoin has to be more useful than current payment systems.\n\nTwo possible applications could embed virtual currencies into the financial infrastructure in a way that is complementary to existing forms of payments.\n\nThe first is as conduits for small international transactions like remittances from foreign workers. Bitcoin could reduce both the cost and the time required for such payments.\n\nFor Antonis Polemitis, this means that consumers should rejoice, and money transmission firms like Western Union and MoneyGram International should worry. \u201cBitcoin is like email and the other stuff is like the post office,\u201d says Mr. Polemitis, who heads Ledra Capital LLC, a family office looking to invest in the bitcoin arena.\n\nTellingly, Benjamin Lawsky, New York\u2019s top financial watchdog, is considering regulating bitcoin firms similarly to money transmitters.\n\nThe second potential use is further into the future.\n\nSupporters like Mr. Malka view bitcoin as more than just a currency used to store value. For them, bitcoin is an open financial platform that could house scores of types of data in a secure and universal ledger. From payments for road tolls to proof of ownership for cars and houses, bitcoin could be an independent, secure and reliable host of financial and personal information.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a technology experiment, it is an experimental society,\u201d Mr. Malka says.\n\nIt sounds far-fetched. Even bitcoin evangelists concede that this could only happen if three conditions materialize.\n\nFirst, the current infrastructure\u2014largely anonymous, anchored by unregulated overseas exchanges and vulnerable to manipulation by criminals\u2014must be overhauled through the creation of U.S. exchanges overseen by financial watchdogs. Second, institutional money like pension funds will have to invest in bitcoin to curb its wild price volatility. And, third, banks will have to view bitcoin as legitimate and enable customers to exchange it for dollars and cents.\n\nNone of those is a given, and none of those would make bitcoin a replacement for the dollar. But behind all the hype and fear, there is a real possibility that bitcoin will play more than a bit part in the financial industry of the future.\n\nFrancesco Guerrera is The Wall Street Journal\u2019s financial editor.
