The average ER visit takes over two hours. In some states, it\u2019s north of three.\n\nPresident Obama promised that the Affordable Care Act would alleviate the pressure on ERs by expanding access to insurance \u2014 and thus diverting people who previously would\u2019ve gone to the emergency room for routine care to the doctor\u2019s office instead.\n\nBut according to a new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, ObamaCare has had almost no impact on ER usage. In fact, by doling out insurance coverage to millions more people without doing anything to address America\u2019s growing doctor shortage, the president\u2019s health reform law may make the ER crisis even worse.\n\nOf course, that\u2019s not what President Obama predicted when he sold his health reform package to the public. At a speech in 2009, he proclaimed that ObamaCare would \u201csave all of us money and reduce pressures on emergency rooms all across the country.\u201d\n\nHis reasoning made some degree of sense. The majority of patients seeking care in the ER are uninsured. ObamaCare would give many of these folks coverage, whether through the exchanges or the expansion of Medicaid, the joint federal-state health care program for the poor. Armed with that coverage, his thinking went, they\u2019d visit the lower-cost doctor\u2019s office rather than the higher-cost emergency room. Ergo, fewer overall visits to the ER.\n\nThings haven\u2019t worked out that way. In 2013, the year before ObamaCare\u2019s exchanges launched and its Medicaid expansion took effect, nearly 20% of Americans visited the ER. In 2014, that figure stayed the same \u2014 even after the law had extended insurance coverage to 9 million previously uninsured Americans. More than 71% of those people got their coverage through states\u2019 expansion of Medicaid.\n\nThe percentage of Medicaid patients who went to the emergency room because they couldn\u2019t get care elsewhere actually rose. That\u2019s exactly the opposite of what the president predicted.\n\nPerhaps that shouldn\u2019t be surprising. Doctors have long been reluctant to take Medicaid because of the program\u2019s low reimbursement rates, which are two-thirds of what Medicare pays, on average. Nearly one in three doctors refuse to accept new Medicaid patients.\n\nBy increasing the number of people on Medicaid\u2019s rolls, ObamaCare has made the competition for appointments with the remaining doctors who will see them even stiffer.\n\nMeanwhile, the overall quality of ER care is worse than before ObamaCare. In 2009, the American College of Emergency Physicians gave the nation\u2019s emergency-care system a grade of C-. This assessment was based on a variety of factors, including access to care providers, patient safety and hospital capacity.\n\nBy 2014, four years into ObamaCare, that grade was even worse \u2014 a dismal D+.\n\nSadly, ERs could be taxed even further. Within the next decade, the U.S. will be short 90,000 doctors, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges. Everyone covered by private insurance, Medicare and Medicaid will be competing for a dwindling number of doctor\u2019s appointments. Folks who can\u2019t get one will have to turn to the ER for medical attention.\n\nAs of today, 19 states have refused to expand their Medicaid programs under ObamaCare. If any change their mind, this problem will only worsen.\n\nThe nation\u2019s emergency departments are ill-equipped to handle more patients. Already, there are only about 13 ER doctors for every 100,000 Americans.\n\nContrary to the president\u2019s promises, ObamaCare hasn\u2019t resuscitated our emergency-care system. It has put it in critical condition.", "article_metadata": {"date": "2016-04-01 13:17:53:-08:00", "description": "America's emergency rooms are on life support.
