Some recalled the pain of the Jim Crow era, while others, white and black teenagers, were dumbfounded that the flag had flown in modern-day America.\n\n\u201cIn my view, it\u2019s kind of ridiculous,\u201d Johnson Pope, 17, a white Columbia resident, who carried an American flag.\n\n\u201cIf it offends people, then they shouldn\u2019t have it up in the first place.\u201d\n\nThe flag reopened wounds in the wake of a shooting massacre that took the lives of nine African Americans, including Sen. Clementa Pinckney last month, after a white supremacist allegedly murdered them inside the historic Emanuel AME Church in Charleston. The suspect, 21-year-old Dylann Roof was photographed posing with the Confederate flag.\n\nCorporations and business groups called for the flag\u2019s removal, and Gov. Nikki Haley reversed her position in defense of the flag and called for it to come down.\n\nThe banner was hoisted in the 1960s as the state\u2019s protest of the Civil Rights movement.\n\nThe Legislature reached a compromise in 2000, which moved the flag from the dome to the grounds, where it flew until Friday. After the flag came down Friday, an advocacy nonprofit for the poor renewed its call for the Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cWe cannot stop at removing the symbol,\u201d said the Appleseed Legal Justice Center in a statement Friday.\n\n\u201cWe must go on with the work and address the problems that many of our good people are facing every day.\u201d\n\nSouth Carolina lawmakers have writhed publicly over whether to lower the flag and place it in the Confederate Relic Room. For some, their reelection was at stake. That and other themes surfaced during that time:\n\nPainful flashpoint\n\nWhen Jerry Govan was a youth in South Carolina, he and his friends noticed a pickup truck coming their way and flying a Confederate flag. Now a 53-year-old black Democrat in the S.C. House, Govan recalled that when the truck went past, a white man inside threw a bag of nails at them. Govan still bears the scars near his eye.\n\nSen. Darrell Jackson, 58, a black pastor from Richland County, remembered when he was first elected.\n\n\u201cImagine a 34-year-old walking into this building and in the first floor lobby, there was a Confederate flag. On the dome of the Capitol there was a Confederate flag,\u201d he said from the Senate floor.\n\n\u201cFor a great deal of time, I would purposely miss the prayer and the Pledge of Allegiance because it was so painful to put my hand over my heart and say the Pledge of Allegiance to the United States flag and look at that same flag.\u201d\n\nPolitical mortality\n\nTaking the flag down forced many elected officials \u2014 mostly Republicans but a few Democrats \u2014 to contemplate their political demise.\n\nRep. Neal Collins, a first-term Republican from Pickens County, decided to miss a flight in order to cast his vote in favor of taking the flag down. His first term could be his last, he mused.\n\n\u201cShould I have an opponent next year, I want them to be able to have this (video) clip,\u201d he said from the House floor.\n\nRep. Chris Murphy, R-North Charleston, scolded his colleagues.\n\n\u201cFor us to worry about being threatened politically? We need to quit worrying about June 2016 and let\u2019s worry about June 2046 and what\u2019s in the best interest of this state,\u201d he said.\n\nBristling at the national media\n\nThe world was watching. But not everyone thought the world was getting a fair version of events.\n\nThe national media swarmed Columbia in the last week, to the resentment of some flag defenders. But lawmakers and political players who opposed the flag didn\u2019t seem to mind. They seemed to relish opportunities to appear, with sweat-beaded brows, on MSNBC and other TV networks.\n\nAmong those who didn\u2019t welcome the outsiders: Rep. Chris Corley, one of 20 House members who voted against the flag removal. Corley had introduced an amendment to replace the Confederate flag with \u201cthe unofficial flag of the South Carolina Republican Party\u201d \u2014 a solid white flag of surrender.\n\n\u201cSince we\u2019re so concerned with the national media, who is never going to treat us right, and voters who are never going to vote for us, and (we) have no concern for our constituents and what they want,\u201d he said.\n\nRep. Eric Bedingfield, a Greenville County Republican who also voted against lowering the flag, was defiant.\n\n\u201cI grew up with that flag, yes, to the national media, as my heritage,\u201d he said from the chamber floor.\n\nAfter the vote, Rep. Bill Taylor, R-Aiken, made his feelings clear in a legislative update to constituents.\n\n\u201cThe national press pounced on South Carolina,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThey were surely disappointed when they found no riots, just prayerful and mourning citizens.\u201d\n\nClass and warfare\n\nSome flag supporters in the Legislature pleaded with their colleagues to see things from their perspective: Their Confederate ancestors were poor. They lived in poverty on par with blacks at the time, they said.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t all come from white plantation homes,\u201d said Chris Corley, the 34-year-old lawmaker and attorney from Graniteville. He said his own ancestors would have been considered, \u201cpoor, white trash.\u201d\n\nThey were yeoman farmers who didn\u2019t even own land, he said, \u201calmost slaves themselves,\u201d who were called up to fight and die in the Civil War.\n\nRep. Mike Pitts, a chief flag defender in the General Assembly, spoke of the Confederate flag\u2019s presence in his childhood, of being 13 before his family had indoor plumbing, and sharing meals and cotton fields with a black family. He also spoke of his grandmother.\n\n\u201cShe was dirt poor,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf the Lord didn\u2019t shine on them a particular year, they didn\u2019t eat.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2"}, "article_summary": "Corley had introduced an amendment to replace the Confederate flag with \u201cthe unofficial flag of the South Carolina Republican Party\u201d \u2014 a solid white flag of surrender.\nOn the dome of the Capitol there was a Confederate flag,\u201d he said from the Senate floor.\n\u201cImagine a 34-year-old walking into this building and in the first floor lobby, there was a Confederate flag.\nThe suspect, 21-year-old Dylann Roof was photographed posing with the Confederate flag.\nBy Sarita Chourey \u2013COLUMBIA \u2014 Amid chants of \u201ctake it down\u201d by thousands who gathered at the Statehouse to witness the last moments of the Confederate flag, South Carolina took a step toward healing from centuries of racial brutality and division."}
