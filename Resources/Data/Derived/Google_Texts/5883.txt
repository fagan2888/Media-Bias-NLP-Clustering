If you’re wondering how to make the holidays more festive, the search is over: Glitter Beards are here, and not a moment too soon!

Hipsters and douches have been boring us with their facial hair for so long that we hardly bother to smirk at the sight of them.

Now, bless them, they have upped their game for Christmas 2015.

Notice how we’re not afraid to say Christmas here at Popdust. We figure that if you’re not a Christian, you know what Christmas is and you still expect a celebratory atmosphere. You still want gifts. You still like colored lights. Jesus may not be your lord and savior, but Barneys NY and Amazon can bring good tidings.

We are not like those Christian-hating pagans at Starbucks.

So whatever religion you observe, deck the halls this winter with Glitter Beards!

Of course, it’s hard to get rid of glitter once it’s around, and you will be seeing little particles in your house or office for the rest of your life. But come on, it’s worth it. Life is short and sometimes brutal. Glitter only asks that you go, “OOOOOOOH!”

Learn how to rock a first-rate glitter beard, below. TRIGGER WARNING: There will be man-buns.
