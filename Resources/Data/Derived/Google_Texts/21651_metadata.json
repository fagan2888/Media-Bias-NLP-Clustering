Because PolitiFact awarded its 2013 \u201cLie of the Year,\u201d that\u2019s why. It went to President Obama for his now-notorious claim, \u201cIf you like your health care plan, you can keep it.\u201d\n\nHeady stuff indeed to have to follow an act like that. But as long as there are politicians, public figures and tireless bloggers out there making all manner of statements and claims, we will happily accept the challenge of examining them.\n\nAnd, given the fireworks of yesterday\u2019s award, what better place to start than with a Facebook meme saying that Vladimir Putin accused Obama of being \u201can idiot?\u201d\n\nThe meme \u2013 (we don\u2019t like that term, by the way, but it\u2019s generally used to describe an idea, style or action which spreads, often as mimicry, from person to person via the Internet) -- passed along to PolitiFact included Putin\u2019s picture and the quotation, \u201cAny fourth grade history student knows socialism has failed in every country, at every time in history. President Obama and his Democrats are either idiots or deliberately trying to destroy their own economy.\u201d\n\nThe story, written by Lilly Maier, asked, \u201cDid Putin really call his colleague Obama an idiot? You may wonder why you hadn\u2019t heard about the large-scale diplomatic crisis. We did, too. So we took a look.\u201d\n\nA little digging indicated that the quote had appeared in various places on the Internet over the past several years. PolitiFact finally traced it back to a site called Scooter\u2019s Report, a blog that mixes satirical articles with offensive, manipulated images of Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama.\n\nFurther, the site appears to have been updated only once in the past three years. Those responsible for circulating the alleged Putin quote apparently look at a disclaimer on Scooter\u2019s Report that says: \u201cLike I have to tell you. This is fictitious satire and any resemblance to persons, places, or events is coincidental.\u201d\n\nThe scam could have been revealed with just a little sleuthing. Maier rated the claim Pants on Fire.\n\nNext up was this claim from U.S. Rep. Barbara Lee, D-Calif., who claimed that 60 percent of people on food assistance are working. \u201cThey are,\u201d she said during an appearance on CNN\u2019s Crossfire, \u201cpart of the working poor.\u201d\n\nSince Lee specifically mentioned food assistance during her appearance, PolitiFact took a closer look at what percentage of people receiving food stamps (also known as SNAP, for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) are working.\n\nWhat Lee should have made clear, the piece concluded, was that she meant to single out 60 percent of the pool of recipients expected to work. Her figure was a little high, but anywhere from 42 to 58 percent is a reasonable summary when talking about the percentage of people on food assistance who are working. Her claim was rated Mostly True.\n\nFinally, PolitiFact took up a claim by conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh, who vowed that Obamacare \u201cis going to increase the divorce rate.\u201d\n\nLimbaugh was apparently referring to a story about a New York couple considering a divorce so they could qualify for subsidies individually to offset the cost of health care under the new law.\n\nThe piece, written by Katie Sanders, found that so-called \u201cmarriage penalties\u201d do exist, but that they aren\u2019t limited to the new health-care law. It also can come into play for programs such as food stamps, temporary cash assistance and others.\n\nOther experts weighed in, saying that it would be \u201cpure conjecture\u201d to say the health care law will cause an increase in the divorce rate; at least, any more than it would in those other instances.\n\n\u201cBut there is no research that suggests this will substantially affect the country\u2019s divorce rate, which is a little hard to measure in the first place,\u201d the story concluded. \u201cExperts said the effect may be marginal, as no one has done the research to nail down reasonable expectations. We rate this False.\u201d\n\nOK, the Oscar-equivalent \u201cLie of the Year\u201d is duly awarded and we\u2019re raring to get back in action. \u201cRoll \u2018em.\u201d\n\n-- Dana Tims\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"article_author": "Dana Tims | The Oregonian/OregonLive", "medium": "news", "news_keywords": "politifact oregon, politifact oregon truth-o-meter, rush limbaugh, scooter's report, supplemental nutrition assistance program, news", "title": "Rush Limbaugh, Vladimir Putin and food assistance: PolitiFact Oregon Roundup", "og": {"site_name": "OregonLive.com", "description": "Conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh, Russian lead Vladimir Putin and U.S. Rep.
