The uninsured rate among young people 19 to 25 years old from 2010 through the start of Obamacare's first open enrollment period in October 2013 dropped from 34.1 percent to 26.7 percent, meaning 2.3 million people gained coverage.\n\nSince that first open enrollment period, another 3.4 million young people gained coverage, as well as 10.7 million adults who signed up through health insurance exchanges or through Medicaid, the government's health insurance program for low-income Americans.\n\nMany states have voluntarily expanded Medicaid under Obamacare, and those that did have seen a steeper drop in the number of uninsured people than those that did not. Expansion states have seen a drop of 7.4 percentage points since 2013, while non-expansion states have seen a drop of 6.9 percentage points.\n\nFrom 2013 to 2015, the rate of uninsured Americans dropped from 20.3 percent to 13.2 percent \u2013 a 35 percent reduction.\n\n\n\nQuarterly estimates of the uninsured rate Courtesy HHS/Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index\n\n\"When it comes to the key metrics of affordability, access and quality, the evidence shows that the Affordable Care Act is working, and families, businesses and taxpayers are better off as a result,\u201d Burwell said.\n\nThe new figures coincide with a special enrollment period during tax season that will give Americans another chance to enroll for insurance without paying a penalty next year. The additional time allotted for sign-ups could make more people aware of the law, and increase the insurance rolls. For the 2015 enrollment period, nearly 12 million Americans have gotten coverage through state and federal exchanges.\n\n\n\n[READ: Advocates Push for Pregnancy Exception to Obamacare Enrollment]\n\nThe rates of uninsured people also have declined across races and ethnicities since October 2013, with a greater drop among blacks (9.2 percentage points) and Latinos (12.3 percentage points) than among whites, who had the lowest rate of those uninsured (14.3 percent) to start.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Data Mine [News]", "title": "Obamacare Makes Historic Headway in Boosting Insurance Coverage", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "The administration says the president's signature law is responsible for the largest reduction in uninsured people in decades.", "title": "Obamacare Makes Historic Headway in Boosting Coverage", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/data-mine/2015/03/16/obamacare-makes-historic-headway-in-boosting-insurance-coverage", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/38/ae/eac235904c908a4ff950eec07998/150316-obamacare-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The administration says the president's signature law is responsible for the largest reduction in uninsured people in decades.", "site": "@USNews", "card": "summary", "title": "Obamacare Makes Historic Headway in Boosting Insurance Coverage"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "news", "date_published": "March 16, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Kimberly Leonard,Pulse,picks,public health,DatamineHealthcare,Affordable Care Act,health care reform,Data Mine [News]", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "The administration says the president's signature law is responsible for the largest reduction in uninsured people in decades."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2ecb\"", "article_summary": "Before the major coverage provisions of the Affordable Care Act were implemented, roughly 47 million Americans did not have health insurance coverage.\nFor the 2015 enrollment period, nearly 12 million Americans have gotten coverage through state and federal exchanges.\nFrom 2013 to 2015, the rate of uninsured Americans dropped from 20.3 percent to 13.2 percent \u2013 a 35 percent reduction.\nSince that first open enrollment period, another 3.4 million young people gained coverage, as well as 10.7 million adults who signed up through health insurance exchanges or through Medicaid, the government's health insurance program for low-income Americans.\nThe new figures coincide with a special enrollment period during tax season that will give Americans another chance to enroll for insurance without paying a penalty next year."}
