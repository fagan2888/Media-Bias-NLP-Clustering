In Houston, the search was on for interpreters to help people enroll for insurance.\n\nThose trained to assist with the rush in Dallas prepared to work well past 11 p.m. And in the Rio Grande Valley, an organizer scurried between stacks of library books trying to help a half-dozen people get health care.\n\nThis is what the final day of open enrollment in President Barack Obama\u2019s health insurance marketplace looked like in Texas \u2014 the state with the highest rate of uninsured in the nation and one of the most crucial to the program\u2019s overall success.\n\n\u201cTexans sometimes have a little bit of a Southern sensibility, so it takes these deadlines to get them to get their enrollment completed,\u201d said Mimi Garcia, Texas\u2019 director for Enroll America.\n\nBut the obstacles abounded Monday as people rushed to either complete their enrollment or at least begin, guaranteeing they could then continue in the coming weeks under an Obama administration extension. The healthcare.gov website worked sporadically, an 800 number was slower than usual, and it took hours to get an interpreter and a counselor on the phone simultaneously at a center in Houston that helps refugees.\n\n\u201cWith everybody showing up the last day it\u2019s a little bit rough,\u201d said Bob Reed, vice president of patient services at Parkland Hospital in Dallas. By 2 p.m. Monday, the hospital and its outlying clinics had already seen more people than they had been averaging daily, he said.\n\nFor Texas, where one in four people are uninsured, enrollment is crucial, and the state has lagged behind others that face similar obstacles, including powerful politicians that have vocally opposed the program. By March 1, about 295,000 Texans had enrolled, less than half the 629,000 that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services had projected would enroll by the deadline.\n\nAzeb Yusuf, 45, a program coordinator at the Somali Bantu Community of Greater Houston, has been working since March 8 with a City of Houston navigator to enroll refugees.\n\nBy 8:30 a.m. Monday, more than a half-dozen people from Ethiopia, Nepal, Eritrea, Somalia, Iraq, Iran and other war-torn areas waited inside a small room to see the navigator. Many had visited before. On this last day, they took a day off from work, hoping to meet the deadline.\n\nBesides enrollment assistance, they also needed help from interpreters who speak languages such as Amharic and Tigrigna, the latter spoken in Eritrea. Yusuf said it can take hours for an interpreter and an Affordable Care Act counselor to help on the phone simultaneously, and sometimes one drops off the line. She said a client was on hold for so long last week that the interpreter fell asleep.\n\n\u201cAnd he started snoring,\u201d Yusuf added, laughing.\n\nAs more people streamed in, Yusuf instructed them on how to start enrolling on their smartphones.\n\nMisrak Tessema, a 31-year-old mother of two who moved to Houston from Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, three years ago, took the day off from her cable assembly job to enroll. Clutching her paperwork, she said she had tried to enroll several times.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been coming back and forth and back and forth to get an appointment. It was just so overwhelming with the waiting period and I wasn\u2019t able to get off from work,\u201d Tessema said.\n\nAt a nearby City of Houston-run multicultural center, Juana and Alberto Lopez, both 50, sat nervously with a city-hired application counselor waiting to learn whether they qualified for a subsidy. Their 20-year-old daughter, Juanita, was with them.\n\nAlberto Lopez, unemployed and on disability since he became ill with cirrhosis, might qualify for Medicaid, Juanita Lopez said, explaining that her 3-month-old daughter also has Medicaid.\n\nWith her 13-year-old sister also at home, Juanita Lopez doesn\u2019t believe the family could pay more than $50 a month for insurance. At the moment their income is about $1,200 a month between her mother\u2019s wages as a housekeeper and her father\u2019s disability. Most of that goes to a monthly rent of $1,000, she said.\n\nBut Monday was the first time they tried to apply.\n\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t sure if we had to do it or not,\u201d Juanita Lopez said. \u201cThe whole process was so confusing.\u201d\n\nAt another city-run multicultural center in Houston, Francisco Montano, a 62-year-old who does odd jobs, waited with his wife, Edith, 58. Montano scoffs at the $50 low-premium plan with the $12,500 deductible they have been offered and questions why he should pay for insurance, considering the companies \u201chave all the money in the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cI first need to know what Obama is trying to impose and whether it\u2019s better for me,\u201d Montano said. \u201cIf it\u2019s better for me to pay a penalty than I\u2019d rather give my money to the government than to the insurance.\u201d\n\n(\u00a9 Copyright 2014 The Associated Press.
