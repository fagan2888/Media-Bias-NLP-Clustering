Many of the women have had issues attaining coverage in the past, in part because of the high health risks and pre-existing conditions common in their profession.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s not all good news for owner Dennis Hof. The new Obamacare mandates will cost him approximately an extra $250,000 per year:\n\nThe Affordable Care Act, Obamacare, has been touted as a boon to America\u2019s self-employed. That includes the independent contractors at the Moonlight Bunny Ranch, otherwise known as prostitutes.\n\n[\u2026]\n\nObamacare has been getting a lot of criticism and negative attention in recent weeks because of its dismal website. But for the women working at one of the few legal brothels in the country, Obamacare is exactly what they need.\n\n\u201cThe working girls, it\u2019s wonderful because finally they\u2019re going to be able to get insurance as the independent contractors they are, and some with pre-existing conditions,\u201d Bunny Ranch owner Dennis Hof said.\n\nHof said the act is actually a double-edge sword for him. Although his working girls will now have health coverage, roughly 150 non-prostitute employees at Hof\u2019s several businesses will get government-mandated coverage at his expense, which he estimates will be about a $250,000 per year.\n\n\u201cEverything changes in January,\u201d Bunny Ranch Prostitute Taylor Lee said. \u201cI\u2019m very excited that this opportunity is around for everyone.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I think it\u2019s \u2018Hookers for Obama\u2019 because they appreciate what he\u2019s done and Obamacare works for them,\u201d Hof said.\n\nWe\u2019re not really sure the White House would welcome that endorsement. On the other hand, though, it does tend to deflect attention from that klunky Obamacare website.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Nevada's Moonlight Bunny Ranch \"working girls\" are excited about Obamacare, KXTV reports.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "Nevada's Moonlight Bunny Ranch", "title": "Bunny Ranch Hookers Love Obamacare", "url": "http://freebeacon.com/issues/bunny-ranch-hookers-love-obamacare/", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/freebeacon.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://freebeacon.com/freebeacon.png", "description": "Nevada's Moonlight Bunny Ranch", "site": "@freebeacon", "card": "summary", "title": "Bunny Ranch Hookers Love Obamacare"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1047859882", "fb": {"app_id": "FB_APP_ID"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe4b12\"", "article_summary": "BY:Nevada\u2019s Moonlight Bunny Ranch \u201cworking girls\u201d are excited about Obamacare, KXTV reports.\nThat includes the independent contractors at the Moonlight Bunny Ranch, otherwise known as prostitutes.\n\u201cEverything changes in January,\u201d Bunny Ranch Prostitute Taylor Lee said.\nCome January 1st, insurance companies will no longer be able to deny health insurance to Nevada\u2019s legal prostitutes.\nBut for the women working at one of the few legal brothels in the country, Obamacare is exactly what they need."}
