EdReports.org will start by bringing in teams of classroom teachers to evaluate K-8 math materials. The curricula will be judged by how well it matches the Common Core and assesses student learning and by whether it offers teachers guidance in reaching children at all levels.The group will post its ratings online and invite response from the publishers. Up first: Pearson\u2019s enVision Math, McGraw-Hill\u2019s Everyday Math, Houghton Mifflin\u2019s Go Math and more than a dozen other widely used curricula. EdReports will turn to high-school math and language arts in future years.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u2014 The project is led by Eric Hirsch, formerly of the New Teacher Center, and Maria Klawe, the president of Harvey Mudd College. They say they hope districts will turn to their ratings to guide purchases. \u201cHopefully with great materials, great teachers and great standards, we will be able to move the needle on student achievement,\u201d Hirsch said. Incoming NEA President Lily Eskelsen Garcia supports the effort; she says curriculum ratings could improve Common Core implementation \u201cby shining a light\u201d on quality materials.\n\nANOTHER LOUISIANA LAWSUIT DUE IN COURT: A lawsuit filed in July by 17 Louisiana lawmakers will have its day in court today. They\u2019re alleging that implementation of the Common Core violates state law. The group of lawmakers, who unsuccessfully tried to repeal the Common Core through legislation earlier this year, is suing the state Board of Elementary and Secondary Education and state chief John White. White and state school board president Chas Roemer have said there\u2019s absolutely no legal basis for the lawmakers\u2019 claim. And while Gov. Bobby Jindal isn\u2019t a part of the lawsuit, he\u2019s publicly backing it. A refresher of the case from The Times-Picayune: http://bit.ly/WyUbfX\n\n\u2014 Meanwhile, Jindal is being sued by parents, teachers, a charter group and his own school board after he renounced the Common Core and aligned tests earlier this year. A judge ruled this week that the case will go forward, but Jindal can\u2019t be deposed. That case will come up in court again on Monday.\n\nTHANK GOD IT\u2019S FRIDAY, AUGUST 15.

The app, \u201cKnowBullying,\u201d will officially launch today at the Education Department-sponsored Federal Partners in Bullying Prevention Summit. Developed by HHS\u2019s Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, the app is based on research showing that parents who spend at least 15 minutes a day with their children can help prevent bullying. The app features \u201cconversation starters,\u201d or recommended ways to talk about bullying with young children. It also includes information on how to spot warning signs and tips on how to prevent bullying before it happens. \u201cIt\u2019s our way of stepping up the game and moving into this next wave of how parents use technology these days,\u201d Ingrid Donato, chief of SAMHSA\u2019s mental health promotion branch, tells Morning Education.\n\n\u2014 The app\u2019s launch comes at a time when the national rallying cry around bullying prevention, though still strong, may be somewhat calmer than it was years ago. \u201cA lot of people remain very passionate about working on this, but the public attention has definitely died down a bit,\u201d said Deborah Temkin, a bullying prevention consultant. Many current efforts tend to emphasize anti-bullying in schools, Temkin said. In the future, she hopes to see more programs focus on prevention. \u201cJust saying \u2018no\u2019 doesn't help prevent behavior,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to start addressing some of the reasons why kids are bullying, instead of telling them just not to do it.\u201d Download the app: http://1.usa.gov/1rLSnKO and more on the summit: http://bit.ly/1rxakv7\n\nAFT: \u2018PRAYERS AREN\u2019T ENOUGH\u2019 FOR FERGUSON: What\u2019s happening in Ferguson, Mo., shows how polarization and power imbalances are \u201cunraveling even the most basic dignity and respect,\u201d American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten said Thursday. Amid growing tensions and police-protester confrontations following the Saturday shooting of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown, the local school district said it would push the start of classes to next week. \u201cToday is supposed to be the first day of school in Ferguson, but this would-be time of promise is instead filled with despair. At a time like this, when an unarmed student was gunned down, we must mourn and we must investigate,\u201d Weingarten wrote. \u201cWe must come together and act, which starts with both healing and respecting peaceful protest. Ultimately, we must overcome the polarization and divisiveness \u2014 because every child deserves to grow up in a safe and welcoming community.\u201d\n\nSTANDOUT SUPERINTENDENTS WANTED: On October 7, the Education Department will host a \u201cConnected Superintendents Summit\u201d to honor local leaders helping their schools and districts transition to digital learning. The summit will allow superintendents to share lessons learned and best practices with each other and the department. The agency also wants people to nominate exceptional district leaders doing this work. Those nominations are due today: http://bit.ly/1rcy2BA More on the summit: http://1.usa.gov/1uV186e\n\nRELEASING ROSETTA STONE INTO CLASSROOMS: The software company is partnering up with Mooresville Graded School District in North Carolina to provide almost 3,000 students \u2014 about half the district \u2014 in grades K-6 with access to digital language learning programs in Spanish and French. Mooresville is no stranger to technology. In June 2013, President Barack Obama traveled there and delivered his first speech [ http://1.usa.gov/1l7A5o3] about overhauling the E-Rate program. At the time, Mooresville was already committed to digital learning. Every student was using a laptop and high-speed, wireless Internet starting in third grade. Now, the students will use Rosetta Stone software for a hour at least once a week. Judy Verses, president of enterprise and education for the company, tells Morning Education that the program is priced affordably for K-12 schools and districts. Rosetta Stone\u2019s software has historically been used to help English-language learners, but the company sees a big opportunity in introducing students to a second language earlier in life. About 2,000 schools are teaching with Rosetta Stone in districts located in Alabama, Maryland, North Carolina, Oregon and Wisconsin.\n\nREMEMBER YOUR PASSPORT: With the new school year approaching, the travel assistance company On Call International is out with updated tips for smooth and safe study abroad. The advice will become increasingly pertinent as the Institute of International Education moves forward with an initiative to double the number of students who study abroad by 2020 (more on that here: http://bit.ly/1hBGT8w). On Call contracts with colleges to help HR and risk management staff prepare for and get through study abroad and other kinds of academic travel, but the guidelines are available to anyone online: http://bit.ly/1sZFkab\n\nREPORT ROLL CALL\n\n\u2014 The National Center for Education Research breaks down how to design and analyze Partially Nested Randomized Controlled Trials, or when some students are placed in a unit like a tutoring group or class to test an education intervention while other students in the control group aren\u2019t broken out into units. http://1.usa.gov/WZxz8r\n\n\u2014 The National Alliance for Public Charter Schools says there\u2019s no significant difference in the percentage of English language learners served by traditional and public charter schools: http://bit.ly/VcZUa1\n\nSYLLABUS\n\n\u2014 New York State United Teachers union decides against endorsing Gov.
