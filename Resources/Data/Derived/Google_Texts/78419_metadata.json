He pitched eight innings overall only to see the Brewers lose, 1-0.\n\nOn Saturday, he also struck out nine in what was only the 15th 1-0 game in the history of the extremely hitter-friendly ballpark.\n\n\"That was really nice,\" manager Ron Roenicke said. \"We were talking earlier today that we needed one of our pitchers to have a big game. That was a big game.\"\n\nGarza began the ninth inning at 102 pitches and needed only nine to record just the seventh complete-game shutout by an opposing pitcher in the 12-year history of Great American Ball Park.\n\nHe got Billy Hamilton to fly out to right, Todd Frazier to fly out to center and Joey Votto on a swinging strikeout to finish what he started and stop Milwaukee's season-high-tying losing streak at four games.\n\n\"I just kept attacking,\" said Garza, who now has 10 career complete games and four career shutouts. His last complete game came Aug. 3 at Oakland, when he was pitching for the Texas Rangers.\n\n\"I had a plan and just stuck with it \u2014 me and (catcher Jonathan Lucroy), like we talk before every game \u2014 and the plan just worked. We went after these guys and we challenged them. Like I said last start, some days are better than others.\"\n\nThere was some discussion about whether he'd come out to pitch the ninth. Garza was due up fourth in the top of the ninth, and with the Brewers nursing their slim one-run lead, they might have considered using a pinch hitter had someone gotten on base.\n\nReds reliever Jumbo Diaz came in throwing gas, however, and retired Milwaukee in order.\n\n\"It wasn't a big discussion,\" Garza said. \"It was a normal discussion, 'If we get a guy on, if we score runs, do you want to go out there?' And I just said, 'Whatever you think is best for the team. If we need runs, let's get them.'\"\n\nThe Brewers scored the game's lone run in the first inning thanks to some clutch two-out hitting by Aramis Ramirez.\n\nLucroy got things going with a double to left and Carlos Gomez followed by drawing a walk against Homer Bailey. That brought up Ramirez, who singled to left to plate Lucroy and give the Brewers their first lead of the series.\n\n\"With those weird shadows that came on, and the way those two guys were locked in, it was definitely going to be a low-scoring game,\" Lucroy said. \"It worked out for us.\"\n\nThe Brewers then made an unexpected lineup change midway through the second, lifting Ryan Braun due to lower back spasms and replacing him with Logan Schafer.\n\n\"Felt it today in BP,\" Roenicke said. \"Thought he was going to be able to get through the game, and obviously he couldn't do it.\"\n\nThe Brewers managed to get a base runner on against Bailey every inning until the fifth but couldn't pad their lead any further.\n\nGarza, meanwhile, was untouchable through four innings.\n\nCincinnati made only solid contact once over that span \u2014 on a Brandon Phillips drive to right that was run down by Schafer in the second. The right-hander didn't allow a base runner until the fifth, when Phillips led off with a single to center.\n\nJay Bruce followed with a rocket to first base that Mark Reynolds gloved, starting an easy double play as he stepped on the bag to retire Phillips as well.\n\nIn the sixth, Ramirez singled to right with two outs. Khris Davis followed with a drive to right-center that hit off the base of the wall, leaving third-base coach Ed Sedar to wave Ramirez around third.\n\nThe Reds executed a terrific relay, with Bruce hitting shortstop Zack Cozart, who then made a great throw home to a waiting Devin Mesoraco for the third out.\n\nCozart doubled to left with one out in the bottom of the sixth to give Cincinnati its first runner in scoring position on the day, but Garza struck out both Bailey and Hamilton to get out of the jam.\n\nGarza struck out Hamilton on a 96-mph fastball, eliciting a little extra emotion from him as he walked off the mound.\n\n\"Yeah, the ball was coming out of my hand,\" Garza said. \"But that could also be seven days off from my last start. We needed a break and we needed to win, and we came through today. Bailey threw the ball well, too. Shoot, he had that one hiccup in the first and then it was just a straight street fight between the two teams.\"\n\nThe bottom of the seventh was almost an instant replay of the sixth, which was bad news for the Brewers.\n\nReynolds drew a one-out walk, and then with two outs, Scooter Gennett doubled down the right-field line. Sedar, again being aggressive, waved Reynolds around third.\n\nBruce this time hit Phillips, who in turn made a great throw home to Mesoraco. Reynolds tried scoring on a headfirst slide but was also out, firing up the big crowd once again.\n\n\"You need to do it,\" Roenicke said. \"It's going to be tough to score runs. It's going to be tough to put together a lot of hits in a row off Bailey. When you get the opportunity, you make them have to make a good play, and they did. The first throw was Cozart right on the money. Then when Phillips gets the ball in his hands you aren't real comfortable either.\n\n\"Two close plays; it's not like they are blowing us up easy. They were close.\"\n\nThe Brewers have played three 1-0 games and won the last two \u2014 both on the road. They previously won in Pittsburgh on June 8 behind Yovani Gallardo.\n\nGarza Saturday\n\n2\n\nhits\n\n2\n\nwalks\n\n9\n\nstrikeouts\n\n111\n\npitches\n\nGarza's career\n\n3\n\nprevious shutouts, including a no-hitter for Devil Rays in 2010\n\n9\n\nprevious complete games\n\nBrewers this year\n\n1\n\nprevious complete game (Lohse, June 5 vs. Cubs)\n\n1\n\nprevious two-hitter (Estrada, Kintzler and Figaro, June 25 vs. Nationals)", "article_metadata": {"title": "Matt Garza dazzles for Brewers in shutout victory", "og": {"url": "http://www.jsonline.com/sports/matt-garza-dazzles-for-brewers-in-shutout-victory-b99304875z1-265914151.html", "image": {"width": 1267, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/b99304875z.1_20140705214017_000_g696u43h.1-1.jpg", "height": 794}, "type": "article", "description": "Matt Garza threw 111 pitches in all and his nine innings bested his April 2 effort, when he took a no-hitter into the seventh against the Atlanta Braves at Miller Park only to see the Brewers lose, 1-0.", "title": "Matt Garza dazzles for Brewers in shutout victory"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/b99304875z.1_20140705214017_000_g696u43h.1-1.jpg", "title": "Matt Garza dazzles for Brewers in shutout victory", "description": "Matt Garza threw 111 pitches in all and his nine innings bested his April 2 effort, when he took a no-hitter into the seventh against the Atlanta Braves at Miller Park only to see the Brewers lose, 1-0.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@journalsentinel"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"admins": "journal.sentinel.1", "app_id": 227386193957280}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-mjs-144-icon.png", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde3ae\"", "article_summary": "His last complete game came Aug. 3 at Oakland, when he was pitching for the Texas Rangers.\nBy of theCincinnati \u2014 Matt Garza's best performance in a Milwaukee Brewers uniform came in his first start for them on April 2.\nThe right-hander dominated the Cincinnati Reds, tossing a complete-game, two-hit shutout to lead the Brewers to a 1-0 victory in front of 38,754 fans at Great American Ball Park.\n\"I just kept attacking,\" said Garza, who now has 10 career complete games and four career shutouts.\nThe Brewers scored the game's lone run in the first inning thanks to some clutch two-out hitting by Aramis Ramirez."}
