FORT COLLINS — A theme for Colorado State football coach Jim McElwain this week is explaining the difference between disappointment and discouragement.

Following an 0-2 start, including last weekend’s heartbreaking 30-27 loss at Tulsa, the Rams can be and should be disappointed, McElwain said.

But they should never be discouraged, he added.

“I sit here,” McElwain said, “and see the development from a year ago. I see our guys playing hard. I see our guys fighting.

“I see our guys fighting through adversity. And I see it in an environment going on the road, where I don’t think we ever would have been in that game.

“Those are the things you can see, and when you watch it on video, you can see the effort. You can see it and you can feel the energy.

“Yeah, you can be disappointed (in the 0-2 record); You should be,” he added. “Discouraged, no. Disappointed, yes. Disappointment deals with the expectations. The discouraged part, when you get discouraged that sinks into your confidence, and there’s no reason for our confidence to take a hit.

“It should take a bruise, but … and the disappointment is we’re sitting here 0-2 and have a possibility of being 2-0. I take responsibility for that. I’m OK with that, because I’m at peace knowing where we are and what we’ve built. Disappointed, absolutely. Discouraged? No.”
