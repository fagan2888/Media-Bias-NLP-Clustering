Two of them actually: volume and value.\n\nSince President Barack Obama enacted the Affordable Care Act in 2010, hospital executives have struggled to reconcile these two dueling priorities \u2014 in many ways, they represent the old and the new.\n\n[MORE: The 2014 Hospital of Tomorrow Conference]\n\nThere is volume, which is encouraged under the old fee-for-service model: the more patients who need MRIs, the more revenue that generates. And then there is value, which is what\u2019s been emphasized under the Affordable Care Act: The more that hospitals and doctors are able to prevent illnesses and injuries from occurring \u2014 such as through community wellness initiatives or workplace yoga and meditation programs \u2014 the fewer people who are admitted or readmitted to hospitals, which is rewarded under the ACA.\n\n\u201cVolume defined us, it defined our success,\u201d Sandra L. Fenwick, president and CEO of Boston Childrens Hospital, said Tuesday as part of a panel at the second annual U.S. News & World Report Hospital of Tomorrow conference. \u201cWe\u2019re struggling now with how do we get the right payment, how do we have the right data and analytics, and how do we keep all of these things in front in terms of making the right kinds of investments.\u201d\n\n[READ: Can Hospitals Do Better at Reducing Readmissions?]\n\nAs fellow panelist Robert Pendelton, chief medical quality officer of University of Utah Health Care,, described, \u201cIt\u2019s like going down the river with our feet in two canoes.\u201d\n\nThe feeling, apparently, is far from unique. The discussion, which also featured J. Knox Singleton, CEO of Virginia-based Inova Health System, brought in a standing-room-only crowd.\n\nModerator Emad Rizk, president and CEO of Accretive Health, laid out six key thoughts from the discussion:\n\nValue is here to stay, so be prepared for how to find it. Boston Children\u2019s Hospital achieved some savings by sending the doctors to the homes of high-risk patients, thereby reducing hugely expensive trips to intensive care units. \u201cIf we could intervene in the home, we could avoid enormous costs,\u201d Fenwick said.\n\nEach health system developed its own value equation. According to Fenwick, that equation at Boston Children\u2019s is \u201cquality plus service plus innovation, divided by price.\u201d At the University of Utah, Pendleton said, it\u2019s \u201cquality plus service divided by cost.\u201d Rizk told the attendees there: \u201cFigure out what that value equation is for your organization.\u201d\n\nMake sure every component and constituency is aligned, That means ensuring satellite centers, nurses, physicians and the main acute-care hospitals are all talking with one another.\n\nThink about the financial back-end up front. Don\u2019t calculate the costs only after something\u2019s happened.\n\nWork with the payers. It may be possible to share data and reduce costs with certain insurers.\n\nDon\u2019t understimate the massive administrative processes that need to happen to make all these changes.\n\nAnd finally: \u201cPatient-first, quality first,\u201d Rizk said.\n\n\u201cFee-for-service is not falling off the planet,\u201d Rizk concluded. \u201cYou\u2019re just going to have variations of fee for service and variations of value. Definitely be proactive and be prepared.\u201d\n\n", "article_metadata": {"usn-stitial-fact": "{\"slug\":\"160202\",\"text\":\"Ninety percent of women have at least one risk factor for developing heart disease.\"}", "usn-comments-mode": "facebook", "description": "Health care executives explore how to reconcile two competing drivers in medicine.", "zone": "hospitalsoftomorrow/articles", "author": "Alan Neuhauser", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Health care executives explore how to reconcile two competing drivers in medicine.", "title": "Building a Bridge Between Value and Volume", "url": "http://health.usnews.com/health-news/hospital-of-tomorrow/articles/2014/10/07/building-a-bridge-between-value-and-volume", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/51/d017a5c2a24f46d5bd6e075c5e4894/49185Slideshow_WomanDoctorTalk_131031.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Building a Bridge Between Value and Volume - US News", "description": "Health care executives explore how to reconcile two competing drivers in medicine.", "card": "summary", "site": "@USNews"}, "usn-platform-id": "a", "site": "health-news", "keywords": "LTHealth [Consumer Advice],healthwellness [Consumer Advice],Pulse,USNHOT14,Hospital of Tomorrow,health care,health care reform,Affordable Care Act,University of Utah,Alan Neuhauser", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "social_id": "http://t.usnews.com/Z3j4x8", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "published_at": "2014-10-07", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/usnewsandworldreport", "published_time": "2014-10-07"}, "usn-content-type": "article", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/1a77718/2147483647/thumbnail/80x80/quality/85/?url=%2Fcmsmedia%2F51%2Fd017a5c2a24f46d5bd6e075c5e4894%2F49185Slideshow_WomanDoctorTalk_131031.jpg", "viewport": "width=980", "news_keywords": "hospital of tomorrow, health care, emad rizk, robert pendleton, sandra fenwick, j knoxk singleton, inova health system, university of utah health care, accretive health, boston children's hospital"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfa2f\"", "article_summary": "\u201cYou\u2019re just going to have variations of fee for service and variations of value.\nTwo of them actually: volume and value.\n[MORE: The 2014 Hospital of Tomorrow Conference]There is volume, which is encouraged under the old fee-for-service model: the more patients who need MRIs, the more revenue that generates.\nModerator Emad Rizk, president and CEO of Accretive Health, laid out six key thoughts from the discussion:Value is here to stay, so be prepared for how to find it.\nEach health system developed its own value equation."}
