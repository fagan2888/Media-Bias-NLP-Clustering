What Kentucky’s Democratic governor has done to implement ObamaCare may soon be undone by the Republican governor-elect.

Matt Bevin, who defeated Kentucky Attorney General Jack Conway 53 percent to 44 percent Nov. 3, campaigned on uprooting Gov. Steve Beshear’s ObamaCare exchange and Medicaid expansion.

Without support from a divided Kentucky Legislature, Beshear created a state-run ObamaCare exchange and opted in to ObamaCare’s expansion of Medicaid to working-age adults with no kids and no disabilities.

Praising Beshear during his 2014 State of the Union speech, President Obama said the governor was “like a man possessed” when it came to implementing ObamaCare — regardless of opposition from state legislators.

Unfortunately for Obama and fans of his unpopular health insurance law, Beshear’s unilateral actions leave the state’s two biggest pro-ObamaCare decisions open to reversal from Bevin.

Bevin won the Republican primary after promising to roll back ObamaCare expansion. He aims to shut down Kynect — the state’s ObamaCare exchange — and direct Kentuckians to the federal exchange by the end of 2016.
