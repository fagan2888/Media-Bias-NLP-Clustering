Our message is one that is uplifting \u2014 that says you can achieve earned success.\u201d\n\nThe remark echoes a comment made by Mitt Romney four years ago, when he was asked at an NAACP event about his stance on the Affordable Care Act. \u201cIf they want more stuff from government, tell them to go vote for the other guy \u2014 more free stuff,\u201d Romney said. He soon followed up with the infamous speech to private donors saying Democrat voters \u201cbelieve that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you-name-it.\u201d Romney went on to lose the election, earning just 6 percent of African American votes.\n\nJeb Bush\u2019s campaign did not respond to ThinkProgress\u2019 inquiry on whether he too was referring to health care, food, and housing when he said \u201cfree stuff.\u201d\n\nRepublican leaders have long acknowledged they have alienated African Americans and other minority groups through both tone-deaf rhetoric and controversial policies, but the party has done little to change its tune.\n\nThough Jeb Bush has made a concerted effort to court Latino voters, his stances on health care, the minimum wage, climate change, and immigration are out of line with what most U.S. Latinos reportedly want. His outreach to African American voters has been minimal, and has largely avoided discussion of his record in Florida \u2014 which included signing the Stand Your Ground gun law, abolishing affirmative action in state universities, and carrying out a voter purge that disenfranchised many eligible black residents.\n\nIn an e-mail to ThinkProgress, Bush campaign staffer Allie Brandenburger argued, \u201cHe has a vision for the future that can unite Americans behind restoring people\u2019s ability to rise up and achieve their dreams.\u201d\n\nCiting criticism of the implication that voters of color have been swayed by \u201cfree stuff,\u201d Brandenburger added, \u201cThe Democrats are creating attacks where they don\u2019t exist because they know their policies have failed the tens of millions stuck in poverty and they fear Jeb\u2019s positive message of expanding opportunity for everyone.\u201d\n\nYet the new remark on \u201cfree stuff\u201d versus \u201cearned success\u201d earned swift condemnation, in part because Bush \u2014 like Romney \u2014 was born into a powerful political family, with all the privileges that entails. Those advantages in life have spanned from his youth, when he attended expensive boarding schools and private universities, to today, where as much as half of the funds his campaign has raised have come from his family\u2019s donor network.\n\nHe has also proven he is not adverse to policies that give out \u201cfree stuff.\u201d The tax plan he unveiled earlier this summer would give massive breaks to corporations, the rich, and those who inherit family wealth. Jeb Bush himself would save hundreds of thousands of dollars a year in taxes under such a plan.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "\"Our message is one of hope and aspiration.
