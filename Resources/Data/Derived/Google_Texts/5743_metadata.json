At the same time, the Board found that Petitioner had not proved by a preponderance of the evidence that claims 7 and 10 of the \u2019417 Patent are unpatentable.\n\nPetitioner had requested inter partes review of claims 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 10, 12\u201314, 16, and 17 of the \u2019417 patent. Patent Owner then disclaimed claims 1, 2, 4, 5, and 12-14. Thus, the Board instituted trial for claims 7, 10, 16, and 17.\n\nThe \u2019417 patent is directed to a vegetation cutter in the form of a string trimmer. A motor is supported within a housing of the device by a mounting plate, \u201cwithout the need for a plurality of ribs to be formed on interior surfaces of the housing of the string trimmer.\u201d\n\nThe Board began with a claim construction analysis. Petitioner had argued that the claim term \u201cfixedly secured\u201d should be interpreted to mean \u201csecurely placed or fastened.\u201d The Board found this proposal to be inconsistent with the plain meaning of the word \u201cfixedly\u201d as interpreted in light of the specification, and instead interpreted \u201cfixedly secured\u201d to mean \u201cfastened such that relative movement is prevented.\u201d The Board also construed other claim terms, including \u201cgroove,\u201d \u201cwithout the need for direct contact,\u201d \u201cwithout contacting,\u201d and \u201cbracket member.\u201d The Board determined that the preamble of claim 16 \u2013 \u201cA method for assembling an outdoor power tool\u201d \u2013 was not a limitation.\n\nAs for Petitioner\u2019s asserted ground that claims 7 and 10 are unpatentable under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103(a) as obvious over Laverick and Mack, the Board concluded that Petitioner had not adequately shown that the combination of Laverick and Mack included the \u201cfixedly secured\u201d claim limitations. In doing so, the Board noted that \u201cPetitioner acknowledged having no evidence to support its position, but argued that \u2018common sense\u2019 was sufficient \u2018in lieu of expert testimony\u2019 under KSR.\u201d\n\nRegarding Petitioner\u2019s contention that claims 16 and 17 are unpatentable under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103(a) as obvious over Mack, the Board first of all concluded that Mack was analogous art. The Board then addressed Patent Owner\u2019s argument that Mack fails to disclose or suggest a method for assembling an outdoor power tool. Ultimately, the Board was not persuaded by Patent Owner\u2019s position on this issue, finding that \u201cclaim 16 is not limited to a method for assembling an outdoor power tool\u201d (because this recitation was set forth in the claim preamble, which during claim construction the Board found to be non-limiting).\n\nPositec USA, Inc. and RW Direct, Inc. v.
