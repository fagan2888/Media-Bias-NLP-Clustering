It’s obvious Rick Scott doesn’t care about being governor of Florida any more.

He has his eyes on a bigger prize — the U.S. Senate in 2018.

Scott continues to campaign, even though he is term limited out. His office sends out press released by the boatload every time some Florida business hires two more people. The man takes credit for everything.

He has tried to stifle voting in Florida, knowing that more Democratic voters will hurt him in 2018,

He even had problems with online voter registration, which will put more people into the voting rolls. He finally signed the bill, but without much of a smile.

And, of course, there is his dance with Medicaid expansion.

The Florida Senate came up with a compromise health care plan this week, but Scott has already nixed it.

Health care expansion would help 800,000 Floridians, but Scott doesn’t want it, because it sounds and tastes and smells like Obamacare.

The man has bashed the president every chance he can get.

He didn’t even show up when the president was in the Everglades talking about sea level rise and climate change. Our governor, instead, took the day to sue the government over something or other that had to do with Obamacare.

We are stuck with him for a couple of more years, this man who somehow won two terms because he has more money than he could ever count, and he was running against weak opponents.

You can bet he’ll run for the Senate in 2018.

Rick Scott in Washington. A scary thought, but maybe not as scary as having him in Tallahassee.

What do you think? Would like to see Rick Scott as a senator?
