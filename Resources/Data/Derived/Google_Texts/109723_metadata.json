Those numbers are identical to the results from an April 2014 NBC/WSJ poll on the same question.\n\nIn the new poll, another 25 percent of Americans say the law needs a major overhaul - down three points from April 2014.\n\nSee the full poll results here.\n\nAnd an additional 25 percent believe it should be \"totally eliminated\" - up four points from a year ago.\n\n(These mostly unchanged results stand in contrast to a recent CBS poll, which found the health law's popularity increasing, though that's a different question from what the NBC/WSJ poll asked.)\n\nOf course, the political parties are split when it comes to the health-care law: A combined 77 percent of Democrats say the law is working well or needs only minor modifications, while a combined 84 percent of Republicans believe it needs a major overhaul or should be totally eliminated.\n\nIn the next few days, the Supreme Court is set to rule on whether it's legal under the health-care law for the government to award subsidies to residents of states that are operating federal-based insurance marketplaces instead of state-based ones.\n\nThe NBC/WSJ poll finds that the public is divided over the Supreme Court's ideology, with 39 percent believing it's too liberal, 38 percent saying it's too conservative and only 6 percent saying it's \"about right.\"\n\nOnce again, there's a difference by party: 63 percent of Democrats think the court is too conservative, while 69 percent of Republicans believe it's too liberal. Independents are split - 33 percent too liberal, 31 percent too conservative.\n\nThe NBC/WSJ poll was conducted June 14-18 of 1,000 adults (nearly 400 via cell phone), and it has an overall margin of error of plus-minus 3.1 percentage points.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Views on President Barack Obama's federal health-care law remain unchanged ahead of an upcoming Supreme Court decision that could potentially gut the law, according to a new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll.", "og": {"site_name": "NBC News", "description": "Views on President Barack Obama's federal health-care law remain unchanged ahead of an upcoming Supreme Court decision that could potentially gut the law, according to a new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll.", "title": "Poll: Views on Obamacare Unchanged Ahead of Looming Supreme Court Decision", "url": "http://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/poll-views-obamacare-unchanged-ahead-looming-supreme-court-decision-n381101", "image": "http://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2015_26/1092106/150625-obamacare-jpo-359a_07426a610b693b29546113519e7e2807.nbcnews-fp-1200-800.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "NBCNews.com", "description": "Views on President Barack Obama's federal health-care law remain unchanged ahead of an upcoming Supreme Court decision that could potentially gut the law, according to a new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll.", "creator": "NBCNews", "image": {"src": "http://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2015_26/1092106/150625-obamacare-jpo-359a_07426a610b693b29546113519e7e2807.nbcnews-fp-1200-800.jpg"}, "title": "Poll: Views on Obamacare Unchanged Ahead of Looming Supreme Court Decision - NBC News", "site": "NBCNews", "card": "summary"}, "blitz": "mu-e1e842c9-946002e6-ea8f0454-41b29546", "DC.date.issued": "2015-06-24", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=319740707, app-argument=http://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/poll-views-obamacare-unchanged-ahead-looming-supreme-court-decision-n381101", "fb": {"app_id": 10150138890205613}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/NBCNews"}, "google-site-verification": "K8bowvEbzWfPQ76x6f9SCxMVwicVXrhiClRg80ak8ZA", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Obamacare, poll, scotus, supreme court, barack obama, health care,Meet the Press,2016 Election"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdeb3e\"", "article_summary": "Views on President Barack Obama's federal health-care law remain unchanged ahead of an upcoming Supreme Court decision that could potentially gut the law, according to a new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll.\nThose numbers are identical to the results from an April 2014 NBC/WSJ poll on the same question.\nSee the full poll results here.\n(These mostly unchanged results stand in contrast to a recent CBS poll, which found the health law's popularity increasing, though that's a different question from what the NBC/WSJ poll asked.)\nIn the new poll, another 25 percent of Americans say the law needs a major overhaul - down three points from April 2014."}
