Do you have an extra $10,000 just lying around that you’re not spending on healthcare premiums or food for your family?

This weekend, the President will be partying in the Pacific Palisaides with Jamie Foxx, and for a cool $10K, you could be in on the adventure. According to TMZ, the Democratic party issued invitations, pictured above (courtsey of TMZ), for a fundraiser this weekend. The event promises to be star-studded, with Jamie Foxx providing the evening’s entertainment in the form of a private concert.

President Obama could be blaming it on the a-a-a-a-alcohol this weekend — ’cause he’s gonna be partying with Jamie Foxx at a ritzy celebrity event … TMZ has learned. The DNC is throwing one of those big ticket fundraisers on Saturday in Pacific Palisades where the Prez will be pressing the flesh and working the room. The original invitation went out saying, “Musical guest TBD” … but our DNC sources tell us Foxx will be the entertainment. If you wanna roll VIP — as in get a photo with Obama and prime seating for the concert — it’ll cost you $10,000!

The invitation does not specify a location — just that the event will be held in a private residence — but it does offer you some slightly cheaper options. If you don’t want a photo with the President and can handle sitting in the back row for Jamie’s serendade, you can get in the door for only $1,000, or the cost of one month of healthcare coverage under Obamacare.
