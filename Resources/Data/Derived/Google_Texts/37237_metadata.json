And, my question is, one, how are these other countries going to trust us now, on taking the lead on global warming? And two, how can anything get done in America when you have to run it by Antonin Scalia first?\u201d\n\nMaher later added, \u201c[I]t\u2019s so interesting to me the way Republicans always rail against activist judges, except when they don\u2019t get what they want, and then they run to the judges to solve it. Obamacare, McCain-Feingold, climate change, gay marriage, then they want Scalia to step in. And again, this is so political. You don\u2019t think this is political, on the part of the judges? Because this is the oligarchy at work. Americans, including Republicans, want action on climate change.\u201d\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett", "article_metadata": {"description": "Maher: SCOTUS Climate Decision Attacked Earth, 'This Is The Oligarchy At Work'", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Maher: SCOTUS Climate Decision Attacked Earth, 'This Is The Oligarchy At Work'", "title": "Maher: SCOTUS Climate Decision Attacked Earth, 'This Is The Oligarchy At Work' - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/02/Maher-SCOTUS-212-Thumbnail.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2016/02/12/maher-scotus-climate-decision-attacked-earth-this-is-the-oligarchy-at-work/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Maher: SCOTUS Climate Decision Attacked Earth, 'This Is The Oligarchy At Work'", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/02/Maher-SCOTUS-212-Thumbnail.jpg", "title": "Maher: SCOTUS Climate Decision Attacked Earth, 'This Is The Oligarchy At Work' - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Bill Maher, EPA, Supreme Court,Breitbart TV, Environment,Maher", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Breitbart TV", "tag": "Supreme Court", "published_time": "2016-02-12T21:28:57-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart TV,Environment"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "Obamacare, McCain-Feingold, climate change, gay marriage, then they want Scalia to step in.\nAmericans, including Republicans, want action on climate change.\u201dFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett\nAnd, my question is, one, how are these other countries going to trust us now, on taking the lead on global warming?\nBecause this is the oligarchy at work.\nYou don\u2019t think this is political, on the part of the judges?"}
