They were coming up and biting you everywhere,\u201d said Megan Devenport.\n\nCity officials say they\u2019re spraying for the insects when they can, but there\u2019s a law that prohibits them from doing it as much as they\u2019d like.\n\n\u201cIf the wind is 10 miles-per-hour or greater, we cannot dispense chemicals,\u201d said Brice.\n\nMeaning if the wind continues to blow, the number of mosquitoes will likely increase.\n\nIt\u2019s a situation the city says it\u2019s doing its best to get a handle on.\n\nFor now, they say all they can do is warn the public of the buzzing and biting invasion.\n\n\u201cWe do the best we can to curtail the numbers, but people need to take their own precautions also,\u201d said Brice.\n\nOfficials suspect the mosquitoes are worse this year than previous years because of recent rain storms.\n\nThe city says it\u2019s been spraying in the middle of the night when the wind cooperates.", "article_metadata": {"description": "[anvplayer video=\"287578\" /] CLOVIS, N.M.
