What\u2013if anything\u2013should we do about it?\n\nDARYL HANNAH: There\u2019s also a consensus that we must act urgently, if we are to avoid a 4-degree Celsius raise and total systems collapse.\n\nFirst we should safeguard, restore and wisely manage our life-support systems, including uncontaminated water bodies and sources, soil and seeds and practice conservation and efficiency.\n\nKnown climate-destructive practices must be phased out as soon as possible, including extreme forms of fossil-fuel extraction (e.g. fracking, SAG D, deep-water drilling surface mines, mountaintop removal and tar sands projects), ocean trawling, overfishing, crop burning and endangering nature\u2019s protective resources like mangroves, coral reefs, forests and peat land.\n\nWe must also immediately wean ourselves off fossil fuels; coal, natural gas, and oil\u2013and invest in a combination of decentralized renewable energy; solar, wind, geothermal, biomass, micro-hydro and liquid fuels made from waste and other sustainable feedstocks.\n\nWater-intensive, mono-crop, petrochemical industrial agriculture has decimated our topsoil and created dead zones in the oceans. The simplest, most natural and likely, the most effective way to sequester carbon is to rebuild soil. Regenerative organic farming practices build soil. Some of the methods used to accelerate nature\u2019s intelligent soil development process include compost, bio char, brown coal, Micorizal fungi, vermaculture and managed livestock.\n\nIf food waste was a country, it would be the third biggest greenhouse gas emitter behind the U.S. and China. Diverting organic waste from landfills and livestock manure from ponds in anaerobic digesters, compost, and pyrolysis can amend soil vitality while reducing methane.\n\nWhile these changes might seem challenging, we do have the capacity\u2013if we can only galvanize the will. Many communities have already begun implementing some of these solutions. But top-down change is also essential, if we are to address the climate crisis with the speed and scale needed. For this to happen, citizens must insist on getting the influence of money out of politics and the legislative process.\n\nMaximizing regional self-sufficiency with these agricultural practices and energy production methods will strengthen local economies, make them more resilient, help prevent global conflict, and ease the sense of scarcity and the economic burden increasingly felt by the majority.\n\nDaryl Hannah (@dhlovelife) is an actress and environmental advocate.\n\nRead the related article.\n\nRead the latest Energy Report.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "There\u2019s also a consensus that we must act urgently, if we are to avoid a 4-degree Celsius raise and total systems collapse.", "title": "If Food Waste Were a Country, It Would Rank No. 3 For Greenhouse Gas Emissions", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/experts/2013/09/24/if-food-waste-were-a-country-it-would-rank-no-3-for-greenhouse-gas-emissions/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/img/WSJ_profile_lg.gif"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "US", "article.headline": "If Food Waste Were a Country, It Would Rank No. 3 For Greenhouse Gas Emissions", "description": "There\u2019s also a consensus that we must act urgently, if we are to avoid a 4-degree Celsius raise and total systems collapse.", "article_section": "US", "author": "Cristina Lourosa", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "testkeys": "C", "article.page": "The Experts Blog", "page.subsection": "The Experts", "article.summary": "There\u2019s also a consensus that we must act urgently, if we are to avoid a 4-degree Celsius raise and total systems collapse.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.published": "2013-09-24T16:34:04-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-139", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/experts/2013/09/24/if-food-waste-were-a-country-it-would-rank-no-3-for-greenhouse-gas-emissions/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-258B-931", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "US", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "There\u2019s also a consensus that we must act urgently, if we are to avoid a 4-degree Celsius raise and total systems collapse.", "title": "If Food Waste Were a Country, It Would Rank No. 3 For Greenhouse Gas Emissions", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/experts/2013/09/24/if-food-waste-were-a-country-it-would-rank-no-3-for-greenhouse-gas-emissions/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/blogs/img/WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "The Experts", "article.id": "BL-258B-931", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2013-09-24T23:17:50-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8379\"", "article_summary": "If food waste was a country, it would be the third biggest greenhouse gas emitter behind the U.S. and China.\nDiverting organic waste from landfills and livestock manure from ponds in anaerobic digesters, compost, and pyrolysis can amend soil vitality while reducing methane.\nSome of the methods used to accelerate nature\u2019s intelligent soil development process include compost, bio char, brown coal, Micorizal fungi, vermaculture and managed livestock.\nDARYL HANNAH: There\u2019s also a consensus that we must act urgently, if we are to avoid a 4-degree Celsius raise and total systems collapse.\nRegenerative organic farming practices build soil."}
