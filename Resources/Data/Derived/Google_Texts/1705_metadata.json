On the third night of the Manchester, Tenn. fest, White proved his A-list rock star status with a passionate set that repped his two solo records and dipped into his lengthy back catalog.\n\nBonnaroo 2014 Full Coverage: Photos, Video & More\n\nThe headlining set was bookended by a pair of White Stripes standards \u2014 opener \u201cIcky Thump\u201d and closer \u201cSeven Nation Army\u201d \u2014 though White saved plenty of prominent space for his solo work, especially new LP \u201cLazaretto,\u201d which dropped June 10 (check out Billboard's track-by-track review here). The title track, \u201cThree Women\u201d and \u201cAlone in My Home\u201d were all included, the latter two towards the end of the set. But of course, the most frenzied reactions came from the classics.\n\n\n\nWhite dug into the Stripes\u2019 2000 album \u201cDe Stijl\u201d for \u201cLittle Bird\u201d and \u201cHello Operator,\u201d and offered a fleshed-out version of \u201cWe\u2019re Going to Be Friends\u201d with the help of his country-rock backing band. When White returned onstage for an encore after a 90-minute set, everyone knew what was coming in the end, even as the bonus segment neared a half-hour and the time approached 1 a.m. For the grand finale, White and company delivered a lights-out dose of \u201cSeven Nation Army,\u201d with the crowd chanting along to provide extra bass to the stadium-famous rhythm line. Just how well did it go over? Ten minutes after the set\u2019s end, the main stage crowd could still be heard chanting the \u201cSeven Nation Army\u201d rhythm as it marched on across the festival grounds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t all face-melting and rock star glory. Throughout the set, White gabbed to the crowd with equal doses of humility and eccentricity. He shouted out 1930s jazz musicians, Detroit auto workers, Nashville session musicians and homeless traveling musicians. He mentioned his mom several times and encouraged the crowd to appreciate their own. Noting the weekend\u2019s other acts, he wished Nick Cave well and reminisced on how hearing the Arctic Monkeys\u2019 \u201cI Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor\u201d for the first time made him \u201cfeel so good about rock \u2019n roll.\u201d\n\n\n\nStill, White dished a little drama in the set\u2019s requisite rock-star moment. \"Who makes music happen? Does a tabloid like Rolling Stone make music happen?\" he asked early on, just a few weeks after landing the RS cover. \"You and I make it exist!\" Following Kanye West\u2019s rant the previous evening, Bonnaroo headliners have now put the music press on blast for two consecutive nights.\n\nBillboard's Bonnaroo 2014 Video\n\nLive at Lollapalooza 2014", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Billboard", "description": "Bonnaroo has seen flashier and more famous headliners, but Jack White put on a clinic on how to close out the main stage Saturday.
