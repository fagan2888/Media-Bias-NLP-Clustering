One of the things the left insists upon, which I really don\u2019t get, is the obsession with \u201cpolitical correctness.\u201d You\u2019re not allowed to say anything if it will offend, or potentially offend, any other human being.\n\nYou can\u2019t fly a flag on your condo balcony because it may be offensive to someone. (My position: you don\u2019t like the American flag, leave the country and go somewhere that has a flag you like.) You can\u2019t wear a sombrero on Halloween because it may be offensive to a Mexican (even though our local Mexican restaurant takes a photo of you wearing one on your birthday). You can\u2019t have an \u201cAmerican Day\u201d at school to express your patriotism because it may be offensive to another student. If you believe marriage is between a man and a woman, you hate gay people. If you think women should buy their own birth control devices, you\u2019re sexist. If you\u2019re opposed to Obamacare, you want people to die. If you think the US government should enforce immigration laws and stop funding sanctuary cities, you\u2019re a bigot. If you think \u201call lives matter,\u201d you\u2019re a racist.\n\nBy the way, the phrase \u201cpolitically correct\u201d is now politically incorrect. Using the words \u201clame,\u201d \u201ccrazy,\u201d \u201cman up,\u201d and \u201cthug\u201d are not to be used. It\u2019s now racist to use the term \u201ccalling a spade a spade.\u201d Things have gotten absolutely insane and it\u2019s probably insensitive of me to even use the word \u201cinsane\u201d because it might offend someone with a mental disorder.\n\nI\u2019ve been seeing a new buzzword lately \u2014 \u201cself-identify.\u201d If you self-identify has a \u201cwoman\u201d even though you\u2019ve got all your man parts, I have to use pronouns \u201cshe\u201d and \u201cher\u201d when speaking to or about you. If you self-identify as \u201cblack\u201d even though your entire lineage is white, that\u2019s ok. If you\u2019re a woman yet self-identify as a \u201cman,\u201d take hormones and grow a beard and have a baby, you\u2019re a pregnant man. If you\u2019re a teenager and self-identify as a \u201cfemale,\u201d you\u2019re entitled to use the women\u2019s bathroom and locker room\u2013 even if it makes every other female uncomfortable. That\u2019s the way America is now. Again, it\u2019s absolutely insane.\n\nI don\u2019t lean left on any issue so I don\u2019t consider myself \u201cpolitically correct\u201d or \u201cpolitically incorrect.\u201d However, our fearless leader in the White House and the three Democratic hopefuls consider themselves far better people because they\u2019re so much more sensitive than the likes of someone like me.\n\nThey all seem to believe that calling terrorists \u201cradical Islamic terrorists\u201d is politically incorrect because including the word \u201cIslam\u201d somehow may offend Muslims who are not terrorists. They walk on eggshells when they discuss this subject and I actually watched Saturday\u2019s Democratic debates listening to Clinton, Sanders and O\u2019Malley try to explain their refusal to use such terms. On the one hand, it was quite funny (it could\u2019ve been a SNL skit); on the other hand, it was pathetic because how do any of them expect to be the Commander-in-Chief without identifying the enemy?\n\nThe barbarians that terrorized Paris on Friday night self-identify as \u201cIslamic State of Iraq and Syria\u201d (\u201cISIS\u201d) or \u201cIslamic State of Iraq and the Levant\u201d (\u201cISIL\u201d as the empty suit in the White House likes to refer to them). When they\u2019re about to blow themselves up or kill innocent people they utter the words \u201cAllahu Akbar\u201d \u2013 an Islamic phrase meaning \u201cGod is greater.\u201d It isn\u2019t a Catholic, Buddhist, Hebrew, Hindu or Shinto phrase \u2013 it\u2019s an Islamic phrase.\n\nMy question is this: If I\u2019m required to call someone a \u201cwoman\u201d because that person self-identifies as a \u201cwoman\u201d or risk being called insensitive or worse, then why aren\u2019t we required to call radical Islamic terrorists \u201cradical Islamic terrorists\u201d when ISIS self-identifies as \u201cIslamic\u201d?\n\nBottom line: Why doesn\u2019t Obama, as well as the three Presidential hopefuls, include the word \u201cIslamic\u201d when referring to these savages who self-identify as Islamic? Isn\u2019t that the \u201cpolitically correct\u201d thing to do?\n\nI don\u2019t get it, but if you do, God bless you.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Because ISIS self-identifies as Islamic, it\u2019s politically correct for Obama to use the words \u201cIslamic terrorists.\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "BernardGoldberg.com", "description": "Because ISIS self-identifies as Islamic, it\u2019s politically correct for Obama to use the words \u201cIslamic terrorists.\u201d", "title": "ISIS \u2013 The Left\u2019s Double Standard of Political Correctness", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://bernardgoldberg.com/wp-content/uploads/double-standard-definition-300x197.jpg", "url": "http://bernardgoldberg.com/isis-the-lefts-double-standard-of-political-correctness/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Because ISIS self-identifies as Islamic, it\u2019s politically correct for Obama to use the words \u201cIslamic terrorists.\u201d", "title": "ISIS \u2013 The Left\u2019s Double Standard of Political Correctness", "image": "http://bernardgoldberg.com/wp-content/uploads/double-standard-definition-300x197.jpg", "creator": "@bernardgoldberg", "site": "@bernardgoldberg", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "article": {"section": "Contributors", "tag": "terrorism", "published_time": "2015-11-19T17:41:19+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Bottom line: Why doesn\u2019t Obama, as well as the three Presidential hopefuls, include the word \u201cIslamic\u201d when referring to these savages who self-identify as Islamic?\nMy question is this: If I\u2019m required to call someone a \u201cwoman\u201d because that person self-identifies as a \u201cwoman\u201d or risk being called insensitive or worse, then why aren\u2019t we required to call radical Islamic terrorists \u201cradical Islamic terrorists\u201d when ISIS self-identifies as \u201cIslamic\u201d?\nIf you\u2019re a woman yet self-identify as a \u201cman,\u201d take hormones and grow a beard and have a baby, you\u2019re a pregnant man.\nThey all seem to believe that calling terrorists \u201cradical Islamic terrorists\u201d is politically incorrect because including the word \u201cIslam\u201d somehow may offend Muslims who are not terrorists.\n(My position: you don\u2019t like the American flag, leave the country and go somewhere that has a flag you like.)"}
