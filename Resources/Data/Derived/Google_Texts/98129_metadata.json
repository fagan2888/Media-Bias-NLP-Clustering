Family members said he might have wandered off outside as early as 7:45 a.m. on Wednesday.\n\n\"It should be the most cheerful time of the year, not sad,\" said neighbor Liz Thomas, who joined the search Wednesday afternoon.\n\n\"She shouldn't be spending Christmas Eve looking for her children,\" Thomas said of Tristan's mother.\n\nWhen he was last seen, the child was wearing a Batman shirt and black-and-gray sweatpants and might be wearing yellow-and-gray sneakers.\n\nThomas and others walked the streets of the neighborhood looking for the boy before dark fell.\n\n\"We went out scavenging through some ponds and play areas,\" she said. \"We went to the back of peoples' houses, telling the neighbors that there was a little boy missing.\"\n\nPolice investigators discouraged others from joining the search overnight, but said officers would remain on the scene through the night working possible leads.\n\n\"We're searching all areas, the entire apartment complex. We've gone outside those areas as well,\" said Raleigh Police Capt. Tommie Klein.\n\nAnyone who has seen Tristan is asked to call 911 or the Raleigh Police Department's tip line at 919-834-4357 (HELP).", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30;polling-uri=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=1;polling-uri2=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=2;polling-uri3=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=3;polling-uri4=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=4;polling-uri5=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=5;cycle=1", "dcterms.created": "2014-12-24 15:46:00", "description": "The search for a missing toddler will extend into Christmas Day at Arbor Creek Apartments in Raleigh, where Tristan Blue, who is 2 years, 10 months old, was last seen at his home early Wednesday.", "application-name": "WRAL.com", "dcterms.modified": "2014-12-26 06:34:36", "outbrain": {"ob_desc": "id_asset=14306429|asset_type=story"}, "twitter": {"description": "The search for a missing toddler will extend into Christmas Day at Arbor Creek Apartments in Raleigh, where Tristan Blue, who is 2 years, 10 months old, was last seen at his home early Wednesday.", "title": "Search for Raleigh toddler triggers Amber Alert :: WRAL.com", "url": "http://www.wral.com/raleigh-police-search-for-missing-child/14306429/", "image": "http://wwwcache.wral.com/asset/news/local/2014/12/24/14306525/14306525-1427226659-160x120.jpg", "site": "@wral", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#041E30", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "robots": "index,follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/favicons/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/favicons/mstile-310x150.png", "fb": {"app_id": 334167666672300}, "author": "WRAL", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-24T15:46:00-05:00"}, "og": {"site_name": "WRAL.com", "description": "The search for a missing toddler will extend into Christmas Day at Arbor Creek Apartments in Raleigh, where Tristan Blue, who is 2 years, 10 months old, was last seen at his home early Wednesday.", "title": "Search for Raleigh toddler triggers Amber Alert :: WRAL.com", "url": "http://www.wral.com/raleigh-police-search-for-missing-child/14306429/", "image": "http://wwwcache.wral.com/asset/news/local/2014/12/24/14306525/1419891324-14306525-1419458359-800x600.jpg", "type": "article"}, "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/favicons/mstile-150x150.png", "pinterest": "nohover", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msapplication-TileImage": "/favicons/mstile-144x144.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfdd4\"", "article_summary": "Anyone who has seen Tristan is asked to call 911 or the Raleigh Police Department's tip line at 919-834-4357 (HELP).\nPolice closed off access to to the neighborhood, off Buck Jones Road in southwest Raleigh, and suspended a ground search after dark on Christmas Eve.\n\"It should be the most cheerful time of the year, not sad,\" said neighbor Liz Thomas, who joined the search Wednesday afternoon.\nWe've gone outside those areas as well,\" said Raleigh Police Capt.\nTristan, who is about 3 feet tall and 35 pounds, has short black hair and a faded scratch on his forehead."}
