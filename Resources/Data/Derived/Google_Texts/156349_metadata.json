For this reason, I urge you to condition any changes in our relationship on the surrender of these fugitives.\u201d\n\nThe FOP has been pushing the issue with the White House since at least 2009, when trade restrictions with Cuba were first relaxed by Obama.\n\n\u201cOver the years, the FOP has consistently opposed any normalization of relations with the communist nation of Cuba until such time as the government extradites to the United States the violent criminals who are protected there by the Cuban government,\u201d the group wrote.\n\nThe Obama administration should not abandon American values in its desire to open up dialogue with Cuba and its Communist leaders Raul and Fidel Castro, the FOP wrote.\n\n\u201cThe American people and the Fraternal Order of Police do not feel that we must compromise our system of justice and the fabric of our society to foreign dictators like Fidel and Raul Castro,\u201d the letter states.", "article_metadata": {"description": "FOP: Do not \u2018reward\u2019 Cuba for harboring cop killers", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "The Fraternal Order of Police (FOP) blasted the Obama administration on Tuesday for its recent d\u00e9tente with Cuba, demanding that any normalization with the Communist regime be conditioned upon the im", "title": "Police Group Blasts Obama: No Cuba D\u00e9tente Without Cop Killer Extradition", "url": "http://freebeacon.com/national-security/police-group-blasts-obama-no-cuba-detente-without-extradition-of-cop-killers/", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/CUBA-US-150x150.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Fraternal Order of Police (FOP) blasted the Obama administration on Tuesday for its recent d\u00e9te", "creator": "@Kredo0", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/CUBA-US-150x150.jpg", "title": "Police Group Blasts Obama: No Cuba D\u00e9tente Without Cop Killer Extradition", "site": "@freebeacon", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1047859882", "fb": {"app_id": "FB_APP_ID", "pages": 282024895179874}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The White House told the Free Beacon it is pushing for the return of U.S. fugitives in Cuba.\nNormalization with the Communist regime must be based on its agreement to return these fugitives, the FOP maintains.\nThe Obama administration should not abandon American values in its desire to open up dialogue with Cuba and its Communist leaders Raul and Fidel Castro, the FOP wrote.\n\u201cSimply put, we ought not to reward the Cuban policy of providing a safe haven for the murderers of Americans.\nThe FOP is just the latest organization to lash out at the Obama administration for using executive orders to relax the embargo with Cuba and boost diplomatic relations."}
