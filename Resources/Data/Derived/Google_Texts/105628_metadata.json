This year\u2019s selections span the years 1913 to 2004. They include such familiar and popular titles as \u201cThe Big Lebowski\u201d and \u201cWilly Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,\u201d while others were milestones in film history.\n\nStephen Spielberg\u2019s \u201cSaving Private Ryan\u201d from 1998 was chosen in part for its ultra-realism with scenes depicting \u201cwar as hell.\u201d On a lighter note, the comedy \u201cFerris Bueller\u2019s Day Off\u201d from 1986 was chosen as the first film on the registry from the late director John Hughes. Curators noted Ferris Bueller emerged as one of the great teen heroes of film.\n\nThe oldest selection dates to 1913 and is believed to be the earliest surviving feature film starring black actors. Vaudevillian Bert Williams gathered with black performers in New York City to make the film \u201cBert Williams Lime Kiln Club Field Day.\u201d The film was discovered 100 years later in the film vault at the Museum of Modern Art.\n\nThe Library of Congress runs a major film preservation effort at its audio-visual conservation center built inside a Cold War-era bunker in Culpeper, Virginia. With this year\u2019s additions, the National Film Registry now includes 650 films - a small part of the library\u2019s motion picture collection, which contains 1.3 million items.\n\n\u201cBy preserving these films, we protect a crucial element of American creativity, culture and history,\u201d Librarian of Congress James Billington said in announcing the new selections.\n\nSome of the most endangered films are silent films. A report from the library last year found 70 percent of the nation\u2019s silent feature films have been lost and only 14 percent still exist in their original 35 mm format.\n\nThe silent films selected for preservation this year include \u201cThe Dragon Painter\u201d from 1919, starring Hollywood\u2019s first Asian star, Sessue Hayakawa, and the 1916 silent film \u201cShoes,\u201d which examined poverty and prostitution, curators said.\n\nOther films were chosen for their cultural significance. A 1976 independent film entitled \u201cPlease Don\u2019t Bury Me Alive!\u201d that was chosen for the registry is considered by historians to be the first Chicano feature film. Set in a San Antonio barrio, filmmaker Efrain Gutierrez explored his story as a young Chicano man, questioning his people\u2019s place in society at the end of the Vietnam War as thousands of his Latino brethren returned home in coffins. Others faced segregation, poor schools and a justice system that was filling prisons with Chicanos. The filmmakers were angry with how Hollywood portrayed Mexican Americans.\n\n\u201cWe were invisible in our own national culture,\u201d Gutierrez said in a written statement. \u201cWe were being buried alive.\u201d\n\n___\n\nNational Film Preservation Board: http://www.loc.gov/film\n\n___\n\nFollow Brett Zongker on Twitter at https://twitter.com/DCArtBeat .", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"Saving Private Ryan\" and \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\" are among 25 movies being inducted this year into the National Film Registry for long-term preservation, the Library of Congress announced Wednesday.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "\u201cSaving Private Ryan\u201d and \u201cFerris Bueller\u2019s Day Off\u201d are among 25 movies being inducted this year into the National Film Registry for long-term preservation, the Library of Congress announced Wednesday.", "title": "\u2018Saving Private Ryan\u2019 among films being preserved", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/dec/17/saving-private-ryan-among-films-being-preserved/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/17/f54c14da6f4a7931680f6a706700fee6.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/17/f54c14da6f4a7931680f6a706700fee6.jpg", "description": "\"Saving Private Ryan\" and \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\" are among 25 movies being inducted this year into the National Film Registry for long-term preservation, the Library of Congress announced Wednesda", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "\u2018Saving Private Ryan\u2019 among films being preserved"}, "Author": "BRETT ZONGKER", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd20b6\"", "article_summary": "Some of the most endangered films are silent films.\nWASHINGTON (AP) - \u201cSaving Private Ryan\u201d and \u201cFerris Bueller\u2019s Day Off\u201d are among 25 movies being inducted this year into the National Film Registry for long-term preservation, the Library of Congress announced Wednesday.\nThe oldest selection dates to 1913 and is believed to be the earliest surviving feature film starring black actors.\nWith this year\u2019s additions, the National Film Registry now includes 650 films - a small part of the library\u2019s motion picture collection, which contains 1.3 million items.\n\u201cWe were being buried alive.\u201d___National Film Preservation Board: http://www.loc.gov/film___Follow Brett Zongker on Twitter at https://twitter.com/DCArtBeat ."}
