Arizona unofficial election results showed Tobin with 46 percent of the vote against Kirkpatrick's 53 percent, a difference of roughly 10,000 votes.\n\nTobin, 56, was first elected to the Arizona House of Representatives in 2006, and was elected House speaker in 2011. Like other Republicans in the 2014 national races, his campaign focused on tying Kirkpatrick to President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act. Kirkpatrick, 64, in turn, criticized Tobin for excessive spending cuts in education and welfare services. She first won the district seat in 2008, but lost in 2010 to Republican Paul Gosar. But after Gosar moved to the 4th District, Kirkpatrick regained the position in 2012 by 10,000 votes.\n\nThe New York Times called the House district, which covers much of the eastern, rural parts of the state, \u201cone of the most competitive districts in the country.\u201d Roughly 37 percent of voters in the district are registered as Democrats, compared to 32 percent independents and just 30 percent Republicans, according to Arizona Public Media.\n\nAn important demographic is the Navajo community. A large part of Kirkpatrick\u2019s 2012 win was due to redrawn district lines that included the Navajo and other reservations. In an October debate, both candidates agreed on the importance of increased support to the Navajo Nation, a key demographic.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s not forget 2012,\u201d Kirkpatrick\u2019s spokesman D.B. Mitchell told the Arizona Capitol Times. \u201cEveryone thought Ann had lost, until the Navajo vote came in and she gained thousands of votes that ultimately led to her decisive victory.\u201d\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nThe competition was one of the four most expensive U.S. House races in the country. In 2014, Kirkpatrick spent $6,025,095 on her campaign, while Tobin spent $5,928,524, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.\n\n\u201cThere are only so many districts in the country that are truly competitive. And we happen in this case in this cycle to have two of them,\u201d analysts from FirstStrategic Communications told The Arizona Republic, which endorsed Kirkpatrick.\n\nTobin was born and raised in New York City before moving to Arizona in 1979.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://s2.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "midterms 2014, arizona house race, arizona 1st, midterms 2014 arizona 1st, arizona ann kirkpatrick, arizona andy tobin, arizona 2014 kirkpatrick, arizona 2014 tobin, arizona 2014 house race, arizona house race navajo, arizona navajo vote, navajo tobin", "og": {"site_name": "International Business Times", "description": "Arizona unofficial election results showed Tobin with 46 percent of the vote against Kirkpatrick's 53 percent.", "title": "Midterm Election Results 2014: Republican Andy Tobin Trails Democrat Ann Kirkpatrick In Arizona\u2019s First Congressional District, Race Too Close To Call", "url": "http://www.ibtimes.com/midterm-election-results-2014-republican-andy-tobin-trails-democrat-ann-kirkpatrick-1719038", "image": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2014/11/04/ann-kirkpatrick.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Arizona unofficial election results showed Tobin with 46 percent of the vote against Kirkpatrick's 53 percent.", "title": "Midterm Election Results 2014: Republican Andy Tobin Trails Democrat Ann Kirkpatrick In Arizona\u2019s First Congressional District, Race Too Close To Call", "url": "http://www.ibtimes.com/midterm-election-results-2014-republican-andy-tobin-trails-democrat-ann-kirkpatrick-1719038", "image": {"src": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2014/11/04/ann-kirkpatrick.jpg", "identifier": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2014/11/04/ann-kirkpatrick.jpg"}, "site": "@IBTimes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "fb": {"app_id": 263851690471857, "pages": 128026713884051}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/IBTimes", "section": "World", "published_time": "2014-11-05T12:10:27-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-05T12:10:27-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Arizona unofficial election results showed Tobin with 46 percent of the vote against Kirkpatrick's 53 percent."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd4253\"", "article_summary": "But after Gosar moved to the 4th District, Kirkpatrick regained the position in 2012 by 10,000 votes.\nTobin, 56, was first elected to the Arizona House of Representatives in 2006, and was elected House speaker in 2011.\nArizona unofficial election results showed Tobin with 46 percent of the vote against Kirkpatrick's 53 percent, a difference of roughly 10,000 votes.\nIn 2014, Kirkpatrick spent $6,025,095 on her campaign, while Tobin spent $5,928,524, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.\nA large part of Kirkpatrick\u2019s 2012 win was due to redrawn district lines that included the Navajo and other reservations."}
