LOVELAND â€” Police responded to the shooting death of a 73-year-old man just after 2 p.m. Sunday outside of the Medical Center of the Rockies emergency room entrance.

According to Loveland Police Sgt. Mike Halloran, emergency room workers notified police at 2:12 p.m. that they found the man outside with a gunshot wound to his head.

While the Larimer Count Coroner's Office will confirm the cause and manner of his death, Halloran said investigators believe the gunshot was self-inflicted.

Hospital employees reported the man was sitting in his parked car outside the hospital for approximately 15 minutes before he died.

Halloran said the man is believed to be a local resident and was not a current patient of the hospital.

The man's identity will be released by the Larimer Coroner's Office once they perform an autopsy and notify his family.
