“The RNC doesn’t have the authority to change the rules even if we wanted to, and each candidate has to know the rules, learn the rules, and abide by the rules and ultimately the majority will decide everything in Cleveland,” Priebus said on CBS's "Face the Nation."

“I don’t take it personally ... because I kind of just rest in the truth,” Priebus said. “And, you know, it matters when something is right and something is wrong to me.”

Trump made the comments at a New York rally Saturday, saying the RNC “better get going” on making changes.

“Because I’ll tell you what: You’re going to have a rough July at that convention,” Trump said. “You better get going, and you better straighten out the system because the people want their vote, the people want to vote, and they want to be represented properly.”

Trump has ramped up his attacks against the RNC in the past week, accusing party officials of “canceling the vote” in Colorado, which had a convention to award delegates instead of a primary or caucus.
