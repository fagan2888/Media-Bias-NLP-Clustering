Screenshot/YouTube\n\nThe U.S. Open, New York\u2019s premiere tennis event, brings tennis lovers from around the world to Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, where the world\u2019s best players compete. It ended earlier this week, with Serena Williams \u2014 one part of the sisterly duo that\u2019s dominated women\u2019s tennis \u2014 defending her U.S. Open title against Caroline Wozniacki in her first final in 12 months. Despite failing to make the finals in the Australian Open, Roland Garros, and Wimbledon, she was able to beat Wozniacki with a 6-3, 6-3 win, earning her 18th Grand Slam title.\n\n\u201cIt was such a wonderful feeling,\u201d she said in a U.S. Open article. \u201cIt\u2019s so emotional for me. I couldn\u2019t ask to do it in a better place. In the beginning of the week, I definitely wasn\u2019t sure I would make it this long (to the finals). So I\u2019m just elated, to be honest, to have made it this far.\u201d\n\nWilliams attributed her inability to get to the finals of the other competitions to a viral illness, which she says had caused dizziness and a lack of coordination. Her success during the 75-minute-long U.S. Open final game showed that she\u2019s physically and mentally capable of winning, and if you watch the latest Beats advertisement \u2014 you can watch it below \u2014 then you\u2019ll see why.\n\nTennis is a lot more difficult than people give it credit for. A single game can last anywhere from 30 minutes to five hours, so it\u2019s important to be in top shape. Along with basic running and strength exercises, tennis players also strengthen key parts of their bodies used when playing tennis, such as practicing tennis moves with medicine balls.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "serena, williams, shows, us, what, its, be, peak, fitness, new, beats, ad", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Serena Williams just won her 18th Grand Slam title, thanks in part to all the training she does off the court.", "title": "How Serena Williams Achieves Peak Fitness [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/serena-williams-shows-us-what-its-be-peak-fitness-new-beats-ad-302436", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/10/serena-williams.JPG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Serena Williams just won her 18th Grand Slam title, thanks in part to all the training she does off the court.", "title": "How Serena Williams Achieves Peak Fitness [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/serena-williams-shows-us-what-its-be-peak-fitness-new-beats-ad-302436", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/10/serena-williams.JPG", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/10/serena-williams.JPG"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-09-10T16:21:36-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-10T16:21:36-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Serena Williams just won her 18th Grand Slam title, thanks in part to all the training she does off the court."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdba02\"", "article_summary": "Serena Williams just won her 18th Grand Slam title, thanks in part to all the training she does off the court.\nIt ended earlier this week, with Serena Williams \u2014 one part of the sisterly duo that\u2019s dominated women\u2019s tennis \u2014 defending her U.S. Open title against Caroline Wozniacki in her first final in 12 months.\nDespite failing to make the finals in the Australian Open, Roland Garros, and Wimbledon, she was able to beat Wozniacki with a 6-3, 6-3 win, earning her 18th Grand Slam title.\nScreenshot/YouTubeThe U.S. Open, New York\u2019s premiere tennis event, brings tennis lovers from around the world to Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, where the world\u2019s best players compete.\nA single game can last anywhere from 30 minutes to five hours, so it\u2019s important to be in top shape."}
