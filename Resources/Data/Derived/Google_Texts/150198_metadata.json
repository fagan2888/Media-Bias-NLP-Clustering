Many of these competitors train for months, maintaining strict health and fitness routines along with prepping their public speaking abilities.\n\nCelebrity and model trainer Oscar Smith says the biggest thing that people should do when training for a pageant or any big event is learn how to motivate themselves. \u201cTry and get up an hour early and just grab a bottle of water and try and go for a walk around the block,\u201d he told Medical Daily, \u201cIt gets your routine started and your body used to working out.\u201d\n\nSmith has been training models and pageant contestants for the past 25 years. He says that training will take time. Smith recommends starting three months before. \u201cYou want to give yourself that safe time for cushion [so you can] have a cheat day \u2014 especially for your body to change and adapt to the workout routine.\u201d\n\nOf course, eating healthy overall is a goal that one should have even when not training for a specific event. Melissa Rifkin, a registered dietician, believes that eating healthy is more than half of the battle, especially for pageants, and she discourages any diet that advises starvation. \"When you skip meals your body actually does the opposite of what one would think, instead of losing weight people often gain weight,\u201d she told Medical Daily in an email. \u201cThe body feels that you\u2019re in starvation mode, therefore holding on to all calories ingested for fear of future health complications.\u201d\n\nWhether you\u2019re training for a Miss USA pageant or just want to be healthier and stronger, these professionals have shared a few of their coveted secrets. Make sure to speak with a health care provider before starting any new or different fitness program.\n\n1. Eat Well\n\nThis might seem obvious, but this is one of the most difficult challenges that pageant competitors face. Smith says that for pageants, it\u2019s all about finding a balance between fitness competitor and fitness models in regard to body shape. It\u2019s also important to abstain from alcohol, even red wine. \u201cDrink lots and lots of water. You can add some lemon to it to kick start your goals,\u201d he said.\n\nProtein is also a big component if you want to tone up. \u201cAim for 3 meals [per day] with a lean protein at all 3 meals,\u201d Rifkin suggests. \u201cAvoid fried foods which will not only put on the pounds but can lead to acne and future health complications. Add color to your diet, fruits and vegetables are filled with antioxidants which help to keep skin clear and hair shiny.\u201d\n\nThese changes are not only useful for pageants, but also to carry with you throughout your life. Eating healthy can lead to weight loss, less stress, and an overall better lifestyle.\n\n2. Don\u2019t Forsake Your Rent Money For A Gym Membership\n\nMost trainers, especially reputable and successful ones can run their clients up to hundreds of dollars per session. And while it\u2019s motivating to have someone there encouraging you, you don\u2019t have to go broke learning how to work out.\n\n\u201cYouTube is fantastic for all different types of exercise,\u201d Smith said. \u201cJust follow along. It\u2019s the best thing you can do. And if you feel like this isn\u2019t working, there are 20 million other videos to watch.\u201d You don\u2019t have to choose between eating right and going to the gym. Make use of the free resources around you.\n\n3. Get A Workout Buddy\n\nEveryone knows it\u2019s so much easier to work out when you have a buddy or a friend sweating by your side. \u201cFind a friend to do physical activities with, get outside, the more active you are the better you will feel overall and reduce stress while having fun,\u201d Rifkin said.\n\nBoth experts say that one of the most important thing you can do is get rest. \u201cBe sure to get at least 7-8 hours of sleep a night,\u201d Rifkin said. \u201cWithout adequate rest we tend to overeat due to an imbalance in hormones that control satiety.\u201d\n\nEven if you\u2019re not competing to become the next Miss Universe, taking care of your physical health is one of the best things you can do for yourself.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "beauty pageant, miss usa ,miss universe", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Take a look at these three tips that pageant contestants follow themselves, provided by a pageant trainer and a registered dietician.", "title": "3 Ways To Be Healthy And Strong Like A Beauty Queen", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/miss-usa-lifestyle-3-ways-train-beauty-queen-pageant-fitness-and-healthy-eating-286908", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/06/shutterstock73033267_0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Take a look at these three tips that pageant contestants follow themselves, provided by a pageant trainer and a registered dietician.", "title": "3 Ways To Be Healthy And Strong Like A Beauty Queen", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/miss-usa-lifestyle-3-ways-train-beauty-queen-pageant-fitness-and-healthy-eating-286908", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/06/shutterstock73033267_0.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/06/shutterstock73033267_0.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-06-06T15:47:57-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-06T16:05:13-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Take a look at these three tips that pageant contestants follow themselves, provided by a pageant trainer and a registered dietician."}, "article_summary": "Many of these competitors train for months, maintaining strict health and fitness routines along with prepping their public speaking abilities.\nSmith says that for pageants, it\u2019s all about finding a balance between fitness competitor and fitness models in regard to body shape.\nMelissa Rifkin, a registered dietician, believes that eating healthy is more than half of the battle, especially for pageants, and she discourages any diet that advises starvation.\nMake sure to speak with a health care provider before starting any new or different fitness program.\nEat WellThis might seem obvious, but this is one of the most difficult challenges that pageant competitors face."}
