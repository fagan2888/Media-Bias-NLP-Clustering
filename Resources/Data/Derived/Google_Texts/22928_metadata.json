Ted Cruz for president. Fiorina appeared at a rally in Miami on Wednesday to speak in support of the candidate.\n\nHonored to earn @carlyfiorina's endorsement: https://t.co/DQARLNSKMV\n\n\n\nJoin the #CruzCrew: https://t.co/d6gn8DV1xy pic.twitter.com/IBgCuNG227 \u2014 Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) March 9, 2016\n\n\u201cTed Cruz is a fearless fighter for our constitutional rights. He has spent his life protecting Americans\u2019 God-given liberties, and he has always stood by his word. Unlike the status-quo political class in D.C., Ted Cruz didn\u2019t cower when he got to Washington \u2013 he stood unequivocally for the American people. I know Ted, and he\u2019ll do the same as president,\u201d said Carly Fiorina.\n\nIn her speech at the rally, Fiorina spoke of Cruz as a \"true constitutional conservative.\"\n\nWhen Republicans lost the last Presidential election, the Republican establishment thought it knew just what to do. Pass comprehensive immigration reform. Stop talking about \"social issues.\u201d Go along and get along. Don\u2019t rock the boat. Rather than fight for real change they stood by as our government grew increasingly incompetent and corrupt. But they didn't count on Ted Cruz. They didn\u2019t predict that against all the odds and most of the predictions, Texas had just elected a Senator who is a true constitutional conservative, a real reformer, and who definitely doesn\u2019t care if the Washington cartel invites him to their cocktail parties. We need a constitutional conservative to unite our Party. Ted has spent his life defending the Constitution. My father was a conservative judge on the very liberal ninth circuit. It takes someone of true principles and convictions like my dad and like Ted Cruz to stick to their guns. Ted has been fighting these fights--whether it\u2019s for religious liberty or our individual right to keep and bear arms or American sovereignty. And he has won.\n\nFiorina bowed out of the 2016 election on February 10. Her endorsement comes at a rather crucial stage in the election cycle, as Florida votes in a \"winner-take-all\" primary on March 15.\n\nThis post has been updated.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Carly. .05/27/2016 6:27:53AM EST.", "author": "Christine Rousselle", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Carly.", "title": "Carly Fiorina Endorses Ted Cruz", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/christinerousselle/2016/03/09/carly-fiorina-endorses-ted-cruz-n2130748", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/43/1dd94ab0-b952-432a-9e3a-1a7ac8a0f8e5.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Carly.", "title": "Carly Fiorina Endorses Ted Cruz", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/christinerousselle/2016/03/09/carly-fiorina-endorses-ted-cruz-n2130748", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/43/1dd94ab0-b952-432a-9e3a-1a7ac8a0f8e5.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Carly Fiorina Endorses Ted Cruz, Christine Rousselle, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "One-time GOP presidential candidate Carly Fiorina has endorsed Texas Sen.
