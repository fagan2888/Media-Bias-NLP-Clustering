Scott Walker speaks in Eau Claire, Wis., on Oct. 7, 2013.\n\nOhio\u2019s Republican Governor John Kasich drew a firestorm of criticism from his own party with his recent decision to bypass the state\u2019s Republican-controlled legislature and accept federal funding to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. Other Republican governors like Tom Corbett of Pennsylvania and Bill Haslam of Tennessee are second-guessing their initial refusal to expand Medicaid coverage for their state\u2019s low-income residents, a central plank of Obamacare which was supposed to account for more than half of newly-insured Americans. After years of opposition and legal challenges, these conservative lawmakers now find themselves faced with a stark choice: Accept federal funding to expand Medicaid or resist President Obama\u2019s signature health care law and open up a gap in health coverage that would leave millions without access to coverage.\n\nBut in Wisconsin, Republican Governor Scott Walker has charted a third course, one that rejects additional Medicaid dollars while using the health insurance marketplaces created by the Affordable Care Act to expand coverage. The decision makes Walker the most visible Republican among a group searching for creative ways to benefit from the Affordable Care Act while maintain its opposition to the law.\n\nThe 46-year-old governor, who is a favorite of party insiders to run for president in 2016, says that his plan increases coverage for the poor and conforms to a conservative vision of government. For Republicans, the effort could point to a future for entitlement reform. To Democrats, Walker\u2019s plan, which will increase taxpayer burden, leaves too many people uninsured.\n\nSet to take effect this January, Walker\u2019s plan will roll back Medicaid coverage from 200 percent to 100 percent of the federal poverty line, extending standard Medicaid benefits to all low-income Wisconsinites, including about 82,000 additional childless adults who had previously been locked out of the program by the enrollment cap. Those living above the poverty line will be pushed into the federal health insurance exchange, where they will be eligible for subsidized private health care plans under the Affordable Care Act. Walker\u2019s office estimates that under these changes the state will extend health coverage to 224,580 previously uninsured Wisconsin residents. That\u2019s fewer than the 252,678 people who would have gained coverage under the federal Medicaid expansion, but not by much.\n\nOther governors have similarly used the federal health care marketplace to expand health coverage to low-income residents. Last month, the Obama administration approved a plan by Arkansas that allows new Medicaid recipients to shop for private coverage on the insurance exchanges. In Pennsylvania, Corbett has proposed a similar option, which would also alter some current Medicaid benefits and include a job-training requirement. Setting Walker apart is his refusal to accept additional funding for Medicaid, a decision that allows him to continue to vocally oppose Obamacare, while simultaneously embracing the law as a way to advance his entitlement reforms.\n\n\u201cOur unique reforms strengthen Wisconsin\u2019s safety net for those truly in need and help those living above poverty to transition into the market place, while protecting our taxpayers from unnecessary risk and the fiscal uncertainty coming out of Washington, D.C.,\u201d Walker said in a statement.\n\nThe plan also sets Wisconsin apart from other states that have declined the federal expansion of Medicaid, which extends coverage to everyone living at or below 133 percent of the federal poverty line. In a recent report published by the Kaiser Family Foundation, the non-partisan research organization, researchers found Wisconsin to be the only state that will provide full health care access to low-income residents of the 25 states not accepting Medicaid expansion. In other states, the decision not to expand Medicaid has opened up a gap in coverage for those who do not qualify for state Medicaid programs, but are too poor to receive federal subsidies on the health insurance exchanges. The study estimates that about five million people will fall into this coverage gap nationwide.\n\n\u201cWhat this does is it levels the playing field \u2014 it expands Medicaid to everyone up to the federal poverty line, expanding Medicaid to everyone up to 100 percent of the federal poverty rate, and it also helps people achieve independence for themselves,\u201d said Dennis Smith, Walker\u2019s former health secretary. \u201cThe important thing is that everyone now has access to health insurance \u2013 whether they choose it or not is up to them.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s an approach that could prove to be a political boon for Walker, who is frequently mentioned as a potential Republican presidential candidate for 2016. Since taking office in 2010, Walker has gained an avid following among conservatives for his willingness to cut taxes, strong-arm labor unions, expand private school vouchers and force Wisconsin\u2019s fiscal house into order. Although early 2016 polls put Walker\u2019s favorability in the low-single digits, Republican insiders say his ability to pass conservative measures, like Medicaid reform, make him a viable contender.\n\nWalker has not been shy about comparing his record to those of Republicans who shut down Washington to protest the president\u2019s health care law. Earlier this month, Walker published an opinion piece in the Washington Post entitled, \u201cWhat Wisconsin Can Teach Washington.\u201d\n\nAs debate shifts from repealing the Affordable Care Act to adapting and reshaping it, Wisconsin\u2019s Medicaid changes offer one model for how Republicans can reform the health care law from the right.\n\nOf course, not everyone is pleased with Walker\u2019s approach. His plan cuts more people from Medicaid than any other state, pushing an estimated 92,000 Wisconsinites out of the state health program and into the federal insurance marketplace. While these residents will be eligible for subsidized private health coverage, they will likely be exposed to greater out-of-pocket costs and lose some of the benefits, like non-emergency medical transportation and long-term care, that are provided under Medicaid.\n\nCritics also note that Wisconsin is losing out on one of the biggest perks of Obamacare: The federal government\u2019s offer to foot the entire cost of expanding Medicaid. Wisconsin\u2019s non-partisan Fiscal Bureau, which provides reports to the state\u2019s legislature, estimates that Walker\u2019s alternative Medicaid plan will cost taxpayers an additional $320 million through 2020.\n\n\u201cIn the end, it\u2019s going to cost more taxpayers more money and insure fewer people,\u201d said Melissa Baldauff, a spokesperson for the Wisconsin Democratic Party. \u201cWisconsin used to be a model for investment in public health care \u2014 it\u2019s really just a sign of the steady decline in quality of life, which has deteriorated under Scott Walker.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ohio\u2019s Republican Governor John Kasich drew a firestorm of criticism from his own party with his recent decision to bypass the state\u2019s Republican-controlled legislature and accept federal funding to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "The potential presidential candidate is parting ways with fellow Republican leaders to provide health coverage for low-income residents, a move that could point the way for his party\u2019s entitlement reform plans", "title": "In Wisconsin, Scott Walker Looks for His Own Way to Insure the Poor | TIME.com", "url": "http://nation.time.com/2013/11/04/in-wisconsin-scott-walker-looks-for-his-own-way-to-insure-the-poor/", "image": "https://timemilitary.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/ap423178785136.jpg?w=571", "type": "article"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "News, Headlines, Stories, Video from Around the Nation", "fb": {"admins": "1124331582,512158401,808970553,100000018008769", "app_id": 53177223193}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://nation.time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/c065f7f4495e21fd12fbfa8af086eafd?s=16", "application-name": "U.S.", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/time"}, "keywords": "health care,", "google-site-verification": "RuBIxOwStTsi-KOuQpMhdd-F4UmaxCoOJAOJ8D2hh8Y", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "health care,"}, "article_summary": "Other governors have similarly used the federal health care marketplace to expand health coverage to low-income residents.\nTo Democrats, Walker\u2019s plan, which will increase taxpayer burden, leaves too many people uninsured.\nThat\u2019s fewer than the 252,678 people who would have gained coverage under the federal Medicaid expansion, but not by much.\nWalker\u2019s office estimates that under these changes the state will extend health coverage to 224,580 previously uninsured Wisconsin residents.\nThose living above the poverty line will be pushed into the federal health insurance exchange, where they will be eligible for subsidized private health care plans under the Affordable Care Act."}
