It is with this spirit that I approached International Security Agency (ISA), an international firm that provides executive protection for diplomats and executives.\n\nThe head of ISA\u2019s Philippine operations, Leo Strand, gave me insight into how to be safe in the country. A former commissioned officer of the Swedish special forces unit once entrusted with the protection of the royal family, Strand has trained military and police units all around the world.\n\nStrand spoke of how the rather exotic business of executive protection may be relevant to the everyday entrepreneur or businessperson. As the Philippines is behind in the world in many industries, people may be tempted to simply copy and paste a business model from abroad into the Philippine context.\n\nThis would be a mistake, Strand cautioned. Even in an industry concerned with the universal issue of safety, it\u2019s important to localize the approach to your market. ISA is accomplishing just that in its culture, in its personnel, and in its pricing. Filipino entrepreneurs and executives, especially those introducing a new business into the country, need to make it a point to do the same.\n\nHere are snippets from our chat:\n\nEF: Can you tell me about what ISA does?\n\nLS: We do anything related to security. We train police, military, and special forces units of governments around the world. We also do security consulting\u2014to give you an indication of our scale, we did the 2004 Olympic Games in Sydney.\n\nMost commonly, we do executive protection, with the vast majority of our clients being either foreign executives or foreign diplomats. Between our clients, you\u2019d get a range of risk, but at a minimum, they\u2019re all high level.\n\nEF: How do you get them as clients?\n\nLS: There\u2019s no bidding process as you might think.\n\nWe usually get clients through referral through the embassy or through company representatives. Since we\u2019ve built relationships with governments by training their various units, they know what we do and they trust we can more than meet the complexities required in executive protection.\n\nUnlike Philippine bodyguards, or even other executive protection agencies, our focus is on proactive rather than reactive security.\n\nThis is the Scandinavian model of security.\n\nEF: What does it take to practice the Scandinavian model of security?\n\nLS: With ISA, at least, the requirements are very strict. At a minimum, we require our candidates to have a bachelor\u2019s degree. From there, they usually hail from a police, military, or special forces background. They must especially be good at shooting and at hand-to-hand combat because those are the things we expect to rarely do. The goal in the Scandinavian model of security is to be non-confrontational, no matter the context.\n\nEF: So has the Scandinavian model been successful in the Philippines?\n\nLS: It\u2019s been successful the world over. In our over thirty years of existence, we\u2019ve never lost an agent or a client. Part of the reason is because it\u2019s remarkably functional. It borrows from all the others and only keeps what works, making it a point to adapt to the local culture.\n\nOthers, I\u2019m afraid, don\u2019t do this. When faced with a threat, you might see Filipino bodyguards all hop out of their convoy and look around aimlessly. Or worse, you might get Americans trying to Americanize the Philippines. You can\u2019t drive around in limos here.\n\nEF: How different or similar is your business with others?\n\nLS: From a business standpoint. Mind you, when most people see us, they think of us as a military or police unit. But we\u2019re a business in the same way that a restaurant or a department store is. We have to be concerned with profit and loss.\n\nIf we tried to force what works in other countries onto the Philippines, we would not be as financially successful as we are today. We would have lost clients. We cannot act the same way we do in Mindinao as we would in the Middle East, even though both ostensibly involve defending against terrorists or insurgents.\n\nThis is the truest advice I can give to any businessperson: Adapt, adapt, adapt. You must localize to your market, no matter your field. In my line of work, it can mean the literal difference between life and death.\n\nIn others, it\u2019s no less as important\u2014your business is your livelihood, after all. You cannot risk losing customers or clients because you didn\u2019t think in terms of the cultural context.\n\nEF: Can you give an example of thinking in terms of the cultural context?\n\nLS: It may be as simple as in your personnel. In Singapore, our office is fronted by Singaporeans. In the Philippines, it\u2019s fronted by Filipinos. That makes prospective clients much more comfortable in approaching us.\n\nThe Philippines is also a polite society. While you might get other Western companies who have this my-way-or-the-highway attitude, we\u2019re much more accommodating in how we interact with our clients.\n\nThinking culturally even filters down into the hard numbers of our business. It\u2019s sort of a project I\u2019m working on now.\n\nEF: Can you tell me more about it?\n\nLS: A two-person security detail with ISA is not cheap. We\u2019ve got many expenses to cover in the way of insurance costs and agent salaries and so on. Our agents work on a contract-to-contract basis.\n\nSo one of our agents will be on duty for two weeks, which is the typical length of a business or diplomatic visit, and then be on stand-by for the next contract. But we get a steady flow of clients, and our agents are compensated at European Union, rather than Philippine rates.\n\nThis is a challenge. At present, we\u2019re currently cost-prohibitive to most Filipinos in terms of pure numbers. There may also be a cultural barrier: Filipinos may not understand the value of an executive security firm. They may think a guy in a barong is enough.\n\nEF: Why are security guards not enough?\n\nLS: Simply put, a security guard is not an executive protection officer. To use an analogy, how many people would hire a nurse to conduct critical surgery on themselves instead of a qualified doctor?\n\nA security guard is only qualified to observe and report\u2014that is all their licensing qualifies them for. The same goes for all the off-duty police officers that moonlight as bodyguards. They might be trained in the law enforcement trade, and do an excellent job there, but the protection realm is not about reacting when something happens.\n\nIt is to make sure the opponent is denied the opportunity to act in the first place. So to sell potential clients on the value of ISA, I\u2019ve been recruiting and training Filipinos as executive protection officers. This will allow us to maintain the excellent European standards of ISA, while providing our services at a more affordable rate.\n\nAnd to get our name out there, we\u2019ve been conducting seminars for the major, iconic Philippine corporations. Again, succeeding in business all comes down to thinking in your cultural context.\n\nEF: Can you share some of what you teach to Filipino businessmen?\n\nLS: We teach a concept called situational awareness. Paying attention to your surroundings is a part of it, yes, but it comes down reading the people around you.\n\nEF: How do you teach students to accurately read people?\n\nLS: I tell all my students to look for behavior patterns. If you\u2019re walking down the street late at night, how can you tell if the person standing on the sidewalk up ahead has ill intentions of some kind?\n\nMost people\u2014if you\u2019ll look around us now\u2014walk around relaxed, unless they\u2019re under some form of extreme stress. Then their body will tense up. They\u2019ll square their shoulders and walk around stiffly.\n\nEF: These same principles apply to criminals?\n\nLS: Only more so. If you\u2019re a bad guy, you\u2019re not only stiff, but you\u2019re also scanning your surroundings. You don\u2019t want police or security guards or witnesses to be around, after all.\n\nSo if that guy on the sidewalk keeps darting his gaze around, you may want to move to the other side of the street.\n\nEF: What if you fail to notice the suspicious person until you\u2019re already near him?\n\nLS: That\u2019s part of what we teach. We discourage anything that reduces your ability to be situationally aware, such as walking around, while texting or talking on your iPhone.\n\nEF: What if\u2014for the sake of argument\u2014a person did fail to be situationally aware and found themselves in a dangerous situation?\n\nLS: It happens unfortunately. But to return to our previous example, let\u2019s say that the suspicious guy starts to follow you down the street after you pass him. No matter the exact situation in which this happens, you should always put yourself in a position of advantage within the local context.\n\nThe most obvious example, assuming the opportunity is available, is to place yourself near security guards or policemen. If a crowded area is nearby, like a mall or mercato, duck into there.\n\nThe chances of someone committing a violent crime against you in a crowded, busy place are much slimmer.\n\nIn any situation, there will be the opportunity to gain the upper hand. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re on a street with little pedestrians but a lot of car traffic. The first thing you can do is stop and look at the person who is following you in the eye.\n\nThis indicates that you know that he is there and that you know what he looks like. It\u2019s also a way for you to project power, which should deter the criminal. Most of them have the mentality of a predator out in nature\u2014they want to prey upon the weak.\n\nIf you appear strong, they\u2019ll be far less likely to target you.\n\nEF: After projecting your strength, what do you do next?\n\nLS: From there, you can U-turn into the other direction. That person, if he had ill intent, would be extremely surprised by this.\n\nIf in the rare chance he continues to follow you in the opposite direction, you can position yourself in such a way, that, were he to try anything, you could throw him into oncoming traffic.\n\nEF: What should you do if you can\u2019t use the environment to your advantage?\n\nLS: This may be the best advice of all: If you truly are trapped by a threat, say, a hold-upper, it\u2019s always best to just comply, as long as it does not put you at greater harm or increased risk.\n\nYou can always replace a smartphone, get the numbers of your friends again, however, much of a hassle that is. You cannot, of course, replace your life. - Rappler.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Even in an industry concerned with protecting celebrities and VIPs, localizing the service and pricing are key", "rights": "All rights reserved by Rappler, Inc.", "og": {"site_name": "Rappler", "description": "Even in an industry concerned with protecting celebrities and VIPs, localizing the service and pricing are key", "title": "[Executive Edge] The business of elite security", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/business/features/39517-executive-edge-the-business-of-elite-security", "image": "http://static.rappler.com/images/Leo%20Strand%20ISA%20executive%20edge%20ezra%20ferraz%201.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"app": {"url": {"ipad": "rappler://business/features/39517-executive-edge-the-business-of-elite-security", "iphone": "rappler://business/features/39517-executive-edge-the-business-of-elite-security", "googleplay": "rappler://business/features/39517-executive-edge-the-business-of-elite-security"}, "country": "PH", "id": {"ipad": 600797927, "iphone": 600797927, "googleplay": "com.rappler.RapplerMobile"}}, "site": "@rapplerdotcom", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Even in an industry concerned with protecting celebrities and VIPs, localizing the service and pricing are key"}, "alexaVerifyID": "boi3S3jgq4MUulG4x97ZaZ1dpDQ", "al": {"android": {"url": "fb129650183806730://business/features/39517-executive-edge-the-business-of-elite-security", "app_name": "Rappler - News, social media", "package": "com.rappler.RapplerMobile"}, "ios": {"url": "fb129650183806730://business/features/39517-executive-edge-the-business-of-elite-security", "app_store_id": 600797927, "app_name": "Rappler - News, social media, tech"}}, "bt": {"keywords": "Ezra Ferraz, Executive Edge, security, Leo Strand, International Security Agency, security", "id": 39517, "pubDate": "2013-09-22T00:49:52+0800", "author": "Ezra Ferraz"}, "fb": {"admins": 659407145, "app_id": 129650183806730}, "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://static.rappler.com/components/com_rappler/images/noimage.png", "articleid": 39517, "publishtime": "2013-09-22T00:49:52+0800"}, "pageclass": "article"}, "keywords": "Ezra Ferraz, Executive Edge, security, Leo Strand, International Security Agency, security", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Ezra Ferraz, Executive Edge, security, Leo Strand, International Security Agency, security"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd17e1\"", "article_summary": "Strand spoke of how the rather exotic business of executive protection may be relevant to the everyday entrepreneur or businessperson.\nThere may also be a cultural barrier: Filipinos may not understand the value of an executive security firm.\nUnlike Philippine bodyguards, or even other executive protection agencies, our focus is on proactive rather than reactive security.\nIt is with this spirit that I approached International Security Agency (ISA), an international firm that provides executive protection for diplomats and executives.\nMost commonly, we do executive protection, with the vast majority of our clients being either foreign executives or foreign diplomats."}
