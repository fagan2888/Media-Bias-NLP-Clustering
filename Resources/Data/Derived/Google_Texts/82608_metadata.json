And a 27-year-old Arizonan paying 157 percent extra for Obamacare will cry for a similar Virginian whose coverage will climb 252.5 percent.\n\nFor taxpayers, Obamacare\u2019s 10-year cost has ballooned from $900 billion at enactment in March 2010 to $2.6 trillion today. This ever-expanding outlay will swell the national debt, now at $17 trillion and growing.\n\n\u2022 Communism flopped, in large part, because it totally misunderstood human nature. As Karl Marx wrote in 1875, once \u201cthe springs of co-operative wealth flow more abundantly \u2014 only then can\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0society inscribe on its banners: From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs!\u201d While millions perform charitable work, and saints like Mother Teresa sometimes walk the Earth, most people do not labor around the clock for the common good. Rather, they pursue self-interest \u2014 enlightened or otherwise.\n\nLikewise, Obamacare fundamentally misreads human motivation.\n\nAs Manhattan Institute scholar Avik Roy, M.D., writes in Forbes, \u201cIf you\u2019re healthy, or you\u2019re young, the Obama administration expects you to do your duty and pay up.\u201d\n\nThis entire juggernaut needs some 2.7 million generally lower-income young people (who usually need little medicine) to subsidize older people (who tend to have more money and need more care). Like Communism, this may glisten\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0on paper. But when real-life young Americans weigh this \u201cdeal,\u201d many and probably most will remain on their parents\u2019 plans until age 26 (which the immeasurably brilliant Obama foolishly demanded) or pay modest non-coverage penalties and then savor their presumed immortality.\n\nThus, the rivets will pop, the decks will buckle, and Obama\u2019s mighty steamer will slide into the sea.\n\nFrom steerage to the smokestacks, panicked passengers increasingly will say: \u201cWe should have heeded those stevedores who insisted we remain ashore. We should have ignored the crew\u2019s promises that we would stay afloat, no matter what.\u201d\n\nAnd, by November 2014, the S.S. Obamacare\u2019s passengers will focus their rage on the captain and his officers on the doomed vessel\u2019s bridge.\n\n\u2014 Deroy Murdock is a Manhattan-based Fox News contributor, a nationally syndicated columnist with the Scripps Howard News Service, and a media fellow with the Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and Peace at Stanford University.", "card": "summary", "title": "Not So Extreme After All, by Deroy Murdock, National Review"}, "sailthru.date": "Fri, 2013-10-25 00:00", "robots": "follow, index", "sailthru.title": "Not So Extreme After All", "keywords": "Deroy Murdock", "fb": {"app_id": 129250807108374}, "sailthru.tags": "Not So Extreme After All, Deroy Murdock, National Review", "msvalidate.01": "E48498F585100158A880ED1615918208", "google-site-verification": "OOtPjyj3i8ggfSXzZ7MPoTiwFy_JnfzKMPkjZ5bhpk0", "copyright": "\u00a9 National Review, Inc.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Deroy Murdock, Politics, Nation, World"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcff3c\"", "article_summary": "A family of four Texans can expect to pay 29.5 percent more for an average Obamacare plan versus today\u2019s typical coverage.\nThis ever-expanding outlay will swell the national debt, now at $17 trillion and growing.\n\u201cThese changes are required by federal health care reform, called the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\u201cIf you like your health-care plan,\u201d Obama famously promised, \u201cyou\u2019ll be able to keep your health-care plan.\n\u201cThe federal health care exchange was built using 10-year-old technology that may require constant fixes and updates for the next six months and the eventual overhaul of the entire system,\u201d Internet gurus told USA Today\u2019s Kelly Kennedy.\nObamacare mandates that all individual and small-group plans feature \u201cessential health benefits,\u201d including services for substance abuse, mental health, and maternity."}
