At the time of the ruling in 2012, zero people in the country were eligible for expanded Medicaid, because the Medicaid expansion wasn't effective until January 1, 2014. Republican governors could opt out without making anyone's lives worse. Or rather, they could make people's lives worse without taking anything away from them.\n\nThat won't be the case if the Court invalidates Obamacare subsidies in Healthcare.gov states. People will lose their health plans, and will expect their state and Congressional representatives to reinstate them. And it wasn't the case in Arkansas earlier this year, when the state had to authorize the federal funds designated for its Medicaid expansion, after tens of thousands of people had already enrolled.\n\nThe measure required 75 votes in the 100-member, Republican-dominated state House. And for weeks, more than two dozen Republicans withheld their support. In vote after vote, the authorization failed. If a handful of Republicans hadn't changed their minds, they would've kicked all those new beneficiaries out of the program, just days after they'd entered it.\n\nBut that's exactly what happened.\n\nThe Arkansas News quoted two of the GOP legislators who ultimately caved.\n\nRep. Kim Hammer, R-Benton, said on the House floor that he had decided to vote \u201cyes\u201d after voting against the appropriation earlier in the session. \u201cThere are people that would be hurt if I don\u2019t vote for this, and I don\u2019t want to see those innocent people get hurt because of that,\u201d he said, adding that he would continue to fight for changes to the program and that he would vote against it next year if it does not produce the promised results. Also voting for the program, after voting against it as recently as two weeks earlier, were Reps. Skip Carnine, R-Rogers, and Mary Slinkard, R-Gravette. Carnine said later he has many reservations about the program, but he said the Legislature will have other chances to revisit it. \u201cNow was the time to move on,\u201d he said.\n\nI imagine the pressures facing legislators from Healthcare.gov would be similar if subsidies suddenly became unavailable and tens of thousands of their constituents lost their health plans. Arkansas is no squishy liberal state. But the politics of sitting on your hands when your voters are about to be (or have just been) harmed don't wear well, even in the most conservative parts of the country.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "description": "When the D.C.
