Experimental Evidence of Cinematic Influence on Political Attitudes\u201d found that people who watched one of two sentimental movies (either Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s fairly polemical The Rainmaker or James L. Brooks\u2019 more subtle As Good As It Gets) experienced \u201cleftward shifts\u201d in their attitudes, often becoming more supportive of the Affordable Care Act, or other \u201cliberal\u201d health care polices. According to Dr. Todd Adkins, the study\u2019s principal author, \u201cViewers come expecting to be entertained and are not prepared to encounter and evaluate political messages as they would during campaign advertisements or network news.\u201d\n\nSo Mother Jones went looking for other studies where moviegoers were shown to have experienced an inadvertant turn to the right of left or otherwise after seeing a particular film. Below are excerpts of what they found:\n\nJFK destroyed your faith in the American political system\n\nIn a 1995 study of viewers before and after seeing the film, Stanford psychologist Lisa Butler et al. found that seeing the movie JFK \u201cdoubled the level of anger\u201d of viewers and \u201cwas associated with a significant decrease in viewers\u2019 reported intentions to vote or make political contributions.\u201d The researchers attributed this response feeling of helplessness.\n\nThe Day After Tomorrow made you care more about global warming.\n\nYale researcher Anthony Leiserowitz conducted a national survey three weeks after the film\u2019s release, and found that 83 percent of film viewers said they were \u201csomewhat\u201d or \u201cvery concerned\u201d about global warming, compared with 72 percent of nonwatchers.\n\nThe Cider House Rules turned you pro-choice\n\nA 2011 study by Kenneth Mulligan and Philip Habel at Southern Illinois University found that the \u201cfictional framing\u201d of the abortion issue in The Cider House Rules made audiences more supportive of safe and legal abortion. \u201cParticipants who were randomly assigned to watch [The Cider House Rules] were more favorable toward legalized abortion in the case of incest than those in the control group,\u201d the authors wrote. In fact, they added, \u201cthe movie had a significant effect despite the fact that opinions on abortion tend to be deeply entrenched.\u201d\n\nMalcolm X inspired you to be more concerned about racial discrimination and race relations.\n\nIn a 1997 study in the Journal of Politics, Darren Davis of Michigan State University and Christian Davenport of the University of Colorado-Boulder examined the affect of the 1992 film Malcolm X (directed by Spike Lee and starring Denzel Washington) on African Americans in Houston. The study found the film, and the way it was reinforced in other media, to be \u201cquite powerful in altering political attitudes\u201d among the study subjects.\n\nAll the President\u2019s Men caused Republicans to favor more restrictions on the press.\n\nAll the President\u2019s Men is actually credited with boosting enrollment numbers at journalism school in the United States, due to the heroism of the two journalists. The film also affected the Republican and Democratic attitudes towards the press, according to a 1979 study by professors William R. Elliott, of the University of Oregon, and William J. Schenck-Hamlin, of Kansas State University. As you would probably guess, the study found that the movie caused liberal viewers to have a more positive view of the press and caused conservative ones to hold a more negative one.\n\nWhat movies would you nominate as political attitude\u2013changing?\u2014Ruth McCambridge", "article_metadata": {"description": "A recent study found that people who watched one of two sentimental movies experienced \u201cleftward shifts\u201d in their attitudes.", "original-source": "https://nonprofitquarterly.org/2014/01/08/liberals-and-the-movies-aha-movies-do-alter-political-opinions/", "og": {"site_name": "Non Profit News For Nonprofit Organizations | Nonprofit Quarterly", "description": "A recent study found that people who watched one of two sentimental movies experienced \u201cleftward shifts\u201d in their attitudes.", "title": "Liberals and the Movies: Aha!
