What she isn\u2019t surrounded by is many doctors. Cold Mountain is spread over two sparsely populated counties, Garfield and Pitkin, which are home to several pricey ski resorts. Those factors helped make Colorado\u2019s ski country\u2014which also includes Eagle and Summit counties\u2014the most expensive insurance market in the country last year.\n\nPerry and her husband, Bill Fales, were optimistic when they set out to buy insurance under the Affordable Care Act last year, but that soon turned to disappointment. \u201cWe\u2019re self-employed, we\u2019re 61 years old, and we make too much to qualify for the federal subsidies,\u201d she says. In the end, Perry and Fales took advantage of a hardship exemption granted by the White House to people who found ACA-compliant plans unaffordable, and bought catastrophic plans with a $6,000 deductible.\n\nA three-hour drive to the east, the news about the ACA couldn\u2019t be more different\u2014or better. \u201cDenver may be the most striking example yet of the Obamacare theory working,\u201d says Larry Levitt of the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit that studies health care. A new Kaiser study of health insurance costs in 16 major cities found that Denver\u2019s fell the most\u201416 percent\u2014since the ACA went live, based on a comparison of the benchmark Silver plan for a 40-year-old nonsmoker, the metric upon which federal subsidies are based. \u201cPremiums never go down,\u201d says Levitt. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like the laws of physics. But in Denver and some other places you have insurers competing for market share, and that\u2019s actually lowering premiums.\u201d\n\n\u201cDenver may be the most striking example yet of the Obamacare theory working.\u201d Larry Levitt, Kaiser Family Foundation\n\nColorado\u2019s experience highlights both the law\u2019s promise and the challenges it still must overcome to work for everyone. Like most states, Colorado was divided into geographic rating areas, one of only three criteria insurers can use to vary their prices. (The others are a person\u2019s age and smoking habits.) Last year, the cost variation among Colorado\u2019s 11 rating areas was nearly the widest in the U.S., with comparable Silver plans costing 98 percent more in the priciest areas than in the cheapest ones.\n\nIn February, Frank Hutfless, the Garfield County attorney, drafted a lawsuit claiming that Colorado violated anti-discrimination protections in the ACA by approving such expensive rates in ski country. \u201cCandidly, we believe the way the state has implemented the ACA is illegal,\u201d he says. \u201cIt discriminates against rural Coloradans.\u201d He wants the state to combine rural and metro regions into a single rating area, but he has held off filing suit as the state tries to adjust. Colorado is now engaged in what may be the country\u2019s most aggressive effort to narrow the insurance cost gap\u2014an effort that could provide a model for other states.\n\nOne challenge is that nearly everything costs more in ski country\u2014not just insurance but gas, groceries, and housing. The seasonal nature of the local economy further distorts the cost of health care. During ski season, Summit County\u2019s population swells to about 100,000 from 28,000 as tourists and wealthy second-home owners flood in. To cater to them, the four major hospitals serving the region are equipped with expensive technology and charge higher rates than Denver area hospitals.\n\nOther factors driving up insurance costs in Colorado\u2019s mountains are common across all rural areas: a scarcity of doctors and a lack of competition among insurers to keep prices in check. A Denver resident shopping for a Silver plan has at least 10 insurers to choose from. \u201cHere,\u201d says Hutfless, \u201cwe\u2019re lucky to get three.\u201d\n\nBecause Colorado took advantage of the ACA\u2019s Medicaid expansion, the law has still had a measurable benefit in ski country, especially among the previously uninsured. Before the law took effect in January, 85 percent of the patients at the Summit Community Care Clinic in Frisco were uninsured. By September that had fallen to 65 percent. \u201cFor clinics like ours, the news has been really good,\u201d says Sarah Vaine, the clinic\u2019s chief executive officer. \u201cI see all these folks who have opportunities they sometimes haven\u2019t had their entire lives, people who were very dependent on taxpayer dollars, but are now working again.\u201d The main reason even more of her patients haven\u2019t gotten coverage, she says, isn\u2019t hostility to Obamacare but anxiety about the social stigma of being poor enough to qualify for Medicaid.\n\nThe law will have a hard time winning converts if it can\u2019t reduce high insurance costs for people in rural areas like Marj Perry, the rancher. Colorado has taken several steps toward that end. One consequence of the law has been increased transparency in health-care pricing. Now that they can see the dramatic disparity in the cost of routine medical procedures, many ski country residents seek treatment in Denver, where something like a hip or knee replacement can cost thousands of dollars less than it does closer to home. Over time, market forces should push down treatment costs in the mountains.\n\nFor the ACA\u2019s second year, insurers are competing more aggressively for customers in rural counties, which has also helped ease prices. The biggest development came this summer, when Marguerite Salazar, Colorado\u2019s insurance commissioner, consolidated four of the state\u2019s rural rating areas into two, reducing the state\u2019s total to nine. \u201cConsolidating the higher health cost regions into larger rating areas will spread the risks and the costs of providing health care more equitably over a larger population,\u201d she said at the time. Average rates have fallen more than 7 percent in ski country, but consumers willing to shop around can find better deals. A study conducted for Bloomberg Businessweek by Cynthia Cox of Kaiser found that the benchmark Silver plan in Summit County fell from $484 in 2014 to $266 for the coming year.\n\nColorado is the only state that altered the geographic boundaries of its rating areas this year. Its experience suggests other states may also be able to curb prices. Perry is guardedly hopeful. \u201cWe\u2019re about to dive in and start this horrible process again,\u201d she jokes. \u201cWe\u2019ll see if we fare any better this year.\u201d\n\nThe bottom line: Colorado has found ways to help rural areas with high health insurance costs close the gap with cities.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Joshua Green", "description": "Pricey premiums plagued ski country last year\u2014but the state found a way to fix that.", "parsely-section": "politics", "parsely-image-url": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/i0QSN24CCXKc/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "og": {"site_name": "Bloomberg.com/politics", "description": "Pricey premiums plagued ski country last year\u2014but the state found a way to fix that.", "title": "Giving Obamacare a Lift in Colorado", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2014-11-13/giving-obamacare-a-lift-in-colorado", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/i0QSN24CCXKc/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"description": "Pricey premiums plagued ski country last year\u2014but the state found a way to fix that.", "title": "Giving Obamacare a Lift in Colorado", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2014-11-13/giving-obamacare-a-lift-in-colorado", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/i0QSN24CCXKc/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "site": "@bpolitics", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"status": "Pricey premiums plagued ski country last year\u2014but the state found a way to fix that."}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "parsely-title": "Giving Obamacare a Lift in Colorado", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "parsely-post-id": "NEZRHQ6KLVRV01", "parsely-author": "Joshua Green", "date": "2014-11-13T19:01:02.486Z", "keywords": "Colorado,These 50 States", "parsely-type": "post", "news_keywords": "Colorado,These 50 States", "parsely-pub-date": "2014-11-13T19:01:02.486Z", "parsely-tags": "Colorado,These 50 States,Region: Global,Page: article", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2014-11-13/giving-obamacare-a-lift-in-colorado"}, "article_summary": "Like most states, Colorado was divided into geographic rating areas, one of only three criteria insurers can use to vary their prices.\nColorado is the only state that altered the geographic boundaries of its rating areas this year.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see if we fare any better this year.\u201dThe bottom line: Colorado has found ways to help rural areas with high health insurance costs close the gap with cities.\nThe law will have a hard time winning converts if it can\u2019t reduce high insurance costs for people in rural areas like Marj Perry, the rancher.\nThe biggest development came this summer, when Marguerite Salazar, Colorado\u2019s insurance commissioner, consolidated four of the state\u2019s rural rating areas into two, reducing the state\u2019s total to nine."}
