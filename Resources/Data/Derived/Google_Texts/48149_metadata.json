Burke, the Air Force Accounting and Finance Office director, finance division.\n\n\n\nThere will soon be a new form in myPay under the taxes section this year -- Department of Treasury Internal Revenue Service Form 1095, Employer Provided Health Insurance Offer and Coverage. (U.S. Air Force photo)\n\nUnder the ACA, U.S. citizens and legal residents are required to obtain and maintain a minimum standard of health care insurance, called minimum essential coverage. The proof of minimum essential coverage will be provided by the Department of Treasury Internal Revenue Service Form 1095. TRICARE is one of many health providers qualifying for this coverage.\n\n\n\nIn January 2016, Defense Finance and Accounting Service is required to provide each employee with the IRS Form 1095 for employment during 2015. A hard copy form is scheduled to be mailed to each employee and the form will also be available electronically through myPay under the taxes section.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Air Force would like to stress the importance for Airmen to elect to receive the form electronic only,\u201d Burke continued. \u201cThis action will save the Air Force $200,000 and cause no environmental impact.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdditional information about the impact of the ACA can be found here.\n\nMore military news: AmeriForce.net/NEWS\n\nMilitary Finance information: AmeriForce.net/FINANCE\n\nLeave a comment:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Active-duty, Guard, Reserve, & retiree service members will need proof of health care coverage when filing their 2015 tax returns - Military News", "generator": "HubSpot", "author": "Rebecca", "og": {"url": "http://www.ameriforce.net/blog/military-news-irs-form-1095-available-on-mypay-011816", "image": "http://www.ameriforce.net/hubfs/Images/Blog_Images/160118_Tax_Form-669415-edited.jpg#keepProtocol", "type": "article", "description": "Active-duty, Guard, Reserve, & retiree service members will need proof of health care coverage when filing their 2015 tax returns - Military News", "title": "IRS Form 1095 available on myPay"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.ameriforce.net", "description": "Active-duty, Guard, Reserve, & retiree service members will need proof of health care coverage when filing their 2015 tax returns - Military News", "image": "http://www.ameriforce.net/hubfs/Images/Blog_Images/160118_Tax_Form-669415-edited.jpg#keepProtocol", "card": "summary", "title": "IRS Form 1095 available on myPay"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "9e00f6fc1b45816d00e11c6e252ca485"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "There will soon be a new form in myPay under the taxes section this year -- Department of Treasury Internal Revenue Service Form 1095, Employer Provided Health Insurance Offer and Coverage.\nThe proof of minimum essential coverage will be provided by the Department of Treasury Internal Revenue Service Form 1095.\nA hard copy form is scheduled to be mailed to each employee and the form will also be available electronically through myPay under the taxes section.\nIn January 2016, Defense Finance and Accounting Service is required to provide each employee with the IRS Form 1095 for employment during 2015.\n\u201cThe Air Force would like to stress the importance for Airmen to elect to receive the form electronic only,\u201d Burke continued."}
