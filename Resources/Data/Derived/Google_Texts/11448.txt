A robber was last seen running north after stealing from a bank Friday afternoon.

The suspect reportedly walked into the Wells Fargo on 1800 S. Nevada just before 3:40 p.m. and ordered the teller to give him money. He never showed a weapon or threatened to use one.

The suspect is described as a 40-year-old white male, 6 feet tall with a medium build. He was wearing a gray zip-up hoodie and white sunglasses. His hood was around his face during the robbery.

Police say he fled to the northwest after the robbery. The bank is located on the southwest side of Colorado Springs.
