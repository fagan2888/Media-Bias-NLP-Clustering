As of Friday afternoon, it had raised more than $43,000 from more than 900 people.\"The family is overwhelmed by the love and support that people are showing,\" Pisano said Friday.According to a message posted on the website by Pisano, Poeta, a cheerleader and gymnast, was having trouble with headaches while performing her routines. On Tuesday, she received an MRI of her brain.The next day, her family brought Poeta to the Smilow Cancer Center at Yale-New Haven Hospital, where she was diagnosed with a mass on her brain, Pisano wrote. They learned that the cancerous tumor is in her brain stem and can't be removed surgically. Poeta was fitted for a radiation mask and will begin radiation therapy Monday, she wrote.\"The oncology team hopes this will shrink the tumor,\" Pisano wrote. \"This is not a cure and the mass may grow larger at any point in the future. Chemotherapy may be required, as well, depending on the outcome of the radiation.\"Seymour High School Principal Glenn Lungarini said Poeta is a remarkable young lady who was named all-state cheerleader last year.\"In addition to cheerleading, she is also a very good student,\" Lungarini said. \"She is one of those kids who is friends with everybody. She has a very outgoing personality. She has one of those smiles that brightens your day and lights up the room when she walks in.\"He said the school administration has been in contact with Poeta's family and will be providing additional opportunities for people to support Poeta through a variety of methods in the future.Pisano said she started the fund-raising page at 6 p.m. Thursday, and in half a day she reached the goal of $25,000. The goal then was increased to $50,000 on Friday.The amount continues to grow.\"I feel like people love this little girl,\" Pisano said.Friends and family will meet on Tuesday to plan fundraising benefits, she said.\"So many people are asking what we can do,\" Pisano said.She extended a big thanks to local youth who have helped spread the message on Facebook and Twitter. Messages of hope and love, with the hashtag of #NinaStrong, abound on Twitter.com Even town officials have joined in.According to the Office of the First Selectman's Facebook page, a post reads: \"This is what community is all about. $26,861 raised by 579 donors in 18 hours.
