The sectors to consider are: consumer discretionary, consumer staples, energy, financials, health care, industrials, information technology, materials, telecommunications, and utilities.\n\nI bet many of you guessed information technology, with its high-profile constituents such as Apple Inc., Google Inc. and Facebook Inc. Or perhaps you chose financials, or maybe consumer discretionary, which includes some great companies like Starbucks Corp., Home Depot and Nike Inc.\n\nGood guesses all, but alas those guesses are wrong. The best performing sector was health care, which includes pharmaceutical companies, hospital services, biotechnology and medical devices.\n\nThis is a bit surprising, because historically, health care stocks, along with utilities and consumer staples, are considered safe, defensive plays. By that, I mean investors tend to plow into these sectors during periods of extreme market volatility and fear of a falling market.\n\nThat\u2019s because people are going to get sick and they\u2019re going to buy electricity and food no matter what the economy is doing. Consequently, these sectors tend to hold up better than the others when the market is sinking.\n\nBut last year, the market was relatively calm throughout the year as the S&P 500 gained 13 percent \u2014 yet health care stocks climbed 23 percent.\n\nIn fact, the health care sector has outperformed all other sectors in each of the last three years by a mile. The annualized return of health care, which comprises 55 companies including Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer Inc. and Celgene Corp., is 25.7 percent over that period compared with the annualized return of the S&P 500 of 16.1 percent.\n\nFinancials and consumer discretionary stocks were the closest contenders with annualized three-year returns of about 20 percent. By the way, energy stocks, which have been clobbered by falling crude oil prices, were the worst performers with an annual return of only 4.7 percent, and that sector is down about 12 percent over the past year.\n\n\u201cThree years of outperformance in health care has only happened a handful of times,\u201d said Derek Taner, portfolio manager of the $1.7 billion Invesco Global Health Care Fund. \u201cIf that happens for a fourth year, it would be unprecedented.\u201d\n\nA confluence of three factors has driven health care\u2019s outperformance in recent years, and Taner believes there\u2019s a good chance that it will continue into this year.\n\nFor starters, a large chunk of the performance is coming from biotechnology companies, which are teeming with new drugs and products.\n\nMoney is flowing into this sector as new drug approvals and novel treatments are driving stock prices higher. Biotechs specifically, and health care generally, accounted for 102 of the 275 initial public offerings in 2014, according to Renaissance Capital. The stock price return on these companies last year was one of the best at almost 40 percent.\n\n\u201cThe pipeline of new treatments within pharmaceuticals and biotechs is more robust than I have ever seen it,\u201d Taner said. \u201cThere are new drugs for treating cancer, Alzheimer\u2019s, and we are on the cusp of finding cures for sickle cell anemia.\u201d\n\nThe stock price of Celgene \u2014 one of the largest biotechs with an ever-expanding array of new treatments for cancer and immune-related diseases \u2014 is up 45 percent over the past year. And over the past five years it has soared from about $27 a share to about $122 a share.\n\nThe second factor that is providing a tailwind for health care is the increasing number of mergers, especially in the so-called specialty pharmaceutical area. The best example of this was the announcement last November that Actavis Plc would buy Allergan Inc., the maker of the anti-wrinkle treatment Botox, for $66 billion.\n\nShares of Allergan, which were trading around $116 in early 2014 before the company was a takeover target, now trade above $223.\n\n\u201cThere is massive consolidation going on in the specialty pharma area,\u201d Taner said. \u201cYou buy a company\u2019s existing products and lay those products over your infrastructure, and it is very accretive to earnings.\u201d\n\nAnd finally, hospital services companies are benefiting from health care reform, specifically the Affordable Care Act. When Congress was debating health care reform five years ago, many health care stocks dropped because of the uncertainty and coming regulations.\n\nToday, for better or worse, the reforms are in place, meaning more people have access to health care, and that care is being paid for in many instances by government subsidies. Hospitals will be the beneficiary of some $2 trillion in subsidies over the next decade, meaning they will be getting paid instead of having to write off bad debts.\n\nShares of HCA Holdings Inc., which owns hospitals and diagnostic centers, have basically doubled in the past year.\n\n\u201cI believe the positive themes that have been in motion in health care will remain in motion because these cycles last 10 to 15 years,\u201d Taner said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Over the past three years of this bull market, the best performing sector is surprisingly one of the more conservative, staid and defensive sectors.", "og": {"description": "Over the past three years of this bull market, the best performing sector is surprisingly one of the more conservative, staid and defensive sectors.", "title": "Quick, name the sector that\u2019s been leading the S&P 500", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/columnists/will-deener/20150208-quick-name-the-sector-thats-been-leading-the-sp-500.ece", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/columnists/will-deener/20150208-uk_allergan_actavis_40828047.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/UK_ALLERGAN_ACTAVIS_40828047.JPG", "height": 853}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2015-02-09T03:38:23Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2015-02-09T01:55:59Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Quick, name the sector that\\u2019s been leading the S&P 500\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/columnists/will-deener/20150208-quick-name-the-sector-thats-been-leading-the-sp-500.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/columnists/will-deener/20150208-uk_allergan_actavis_40828047.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/UK_ALLERGAN_ACTAVIS_40828047.JPG\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"2172282\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-02-09T01:55:59Z\", \"section\": \"Will Deener\", \"author\": \"Will Deener\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/columnists/will-deener/20150208-uk_allergan_actavis_40828047.jpg.ece/ALTERNATES/w660/UK_ALLERGAN_ACTAVIS_40828047.JPG", "publishtime": "2015-02-09T01:55:59Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "article_summary": "When Congress was debating health care reform five years ago, many health care stocks dropped because of the uncertainty and coming regulations.\nBut last year, the market was relatively calm throughout the year as the S&P 500 gained 13 percent \u2014 yet health care stocks climbed 23 percent.\nIn fact, the health care sector has outperformed all other sectors in each of the last three years by a mile.\nThis is a bit surprising, because historically, health care stocks, along with utilities and consumer staples, are considered safe, defensive plays.\nThe best performing sector was health care, which includes pharmaceutical companies, hospital services, biotechnology and medical devices."}
