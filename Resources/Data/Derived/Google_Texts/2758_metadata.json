Already in 2015 we\u2019ve placed a primary care physician with a signing bonus of $100,000 in a small town in New England.\u201d\n\n[Also: The latest hospital C-suite titles]\n\nThere is also a growing trend of signing bonuses for nurse practitioners and physician assistants, as competition for those professionals intensifies, Stone said.\n\nIn 2014, 50-percent of non-physician providers were offered a signing bonus, compared to 11-percent in 2013, according to the firm\u2019s annual provider placement summary. Additionally, the average signing bonus for a PA or NP increased from $3,000 in 2013 to $7,500 in 2014.\n\nFollow Healthcare Finance on Twitter and LinkedIn.\n\n\u201cWhat was once considered going \u2018above and beyond\u2019 in up-front bonuses is now the standard practice,\u201d Stone said.\n\nOver the past five years, signing bonuses have gone to 74 to 88 percent of physicians, NAs and PAs placed, according to Medicus. The top specialties placed are family practice, hospitalist and internal medicine, in that order.\n\nMetropolitan area hospitals are finding it increasingly challenging to find enough physicians, particularly primary care physicians and hospitalists, which goes against the common perception for larger cities, according to Stone.\n\nStone said he expects to see more employers and recruiters offering significantly sizeable signing bonuses.\n\nMedicus conducts the annual healthcare provider placement summary from among its client-base of 200-plus hospitals, physician groups, and medical centers nationwide.\n\nTwitter: @SusanMorseHFN", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/signing-bonuses-top-6-figures-healthcare-jobs-recruiting-firm-says", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/doctor-signing-paper-feature.gif", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "Average signing bonuses have ranged from $20,000 to $25,000 over the past five years.", "title": "Signing bonuses top 6 figures for healthcare jobs, research firm says"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/doctor-signing-paper-feature.gif"}, "title": "Signing bonuses top 6 figures for healthcare jobs, research firm says", "description": "Average signing bonuses have ranged from $20,000 to $25,000 over the past five years.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@HC_Finance"}, "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no", "description": "Hospitals and other physician employers are offering up to $200,000 in signing bonuses to fill key openings, according to Dallas-based Medicus Firm.&#13; Average signing bonuses have ranged from $20,000 to $25,000 over the past five years, with most physicians expecting a five-figure signing bonus when recruited, said Medicus President Jim Stone.&#13; \u201cSo, to really get a physician\u2019s attention for particularly challenging searches, some employers are offering six-figure signing bonuses,\u201d Stone said in a statement.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Hospitals and other physician employers are offering up to $200,000 in signing bonuses to fill key openings, according to Dallas-based Medicus Firm.\nAdditionally, the average signing bonus for a PA or NP increased from $3,000 in 2013 to $7,500 in 2014.\n\u201cSo, to really get a physician\u2019s attention for particularly challenging searches, some employers are offering six-figure signing bonuses,\u201d Stone said in a statement.\nAverage signing bonuses have ranged from $20,000 to $25,000 over the past five years, with most physicians expecting a five-figure signing bonus when recruited, said Medicus President Jim Stone.\nAverage signing bonuses have ranged from $20,000 to $25,000 over the past five years."}
