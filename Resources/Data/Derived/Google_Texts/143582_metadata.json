We aren\u2019t gimmicky. You won\u2019t find any special tricks up our sleeves \u2014 though we all know Ed does a pretty nice cartwheel. If you\u2019re looking for drama, look elsewhere. We certainly aren\u2019t the most talked-about campaign in the state \u2014 and we\u2019re OK with that.\u201d\n\nThe subject line of the e-mail: \u201cWe left the glitter at home.\u201d\n\nActually, the glitter\u2019s going to other races: the matchup between Gov. John Hickenlooper and GOP challenger Bob Beauprez, Congressman Cory Gardner\u2019s attempt to unseat U.S. Sen. Mark Udall and the 18 state Senate races.\n\nPerlmutter first ran for the 7th District in 2006 when Republican Bob Beauprez opted to run for governor instead of seek reelection. It was a Democrat wave year and Perlmutter easily handled Rick O\u2019Donnell, who had worked as Gov. Bill Owens\u2019 policy director. Perlmutter\u2019s second race was a snoozer against an unknown candidate whose own campaign T-shirt read \u201cJohn Who? John Lerew!\u201d\n\nThe race got interesting again in 2010 when Perlmutter faced Frazier, a charismatic Aurora city councilman. Although it was a tough year for Democrats, Perlmutter prevailed. Last election was even more interesting when Coors, whose family has been interwined with Perlmutter\u2019s for years, got in the race. Perlmutter won.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason why Republicans have found it to difficult to take out Perlmutter: He seemingly knows everybody in the district.\n\nHere\u2019s how Perlmutter has fared in each of his congressional races:\n\n2012\n\nPerlmutter, 54 percent; Coors, 41 percent\n\n2010\n\nPerlmutter, 53 percent; Frazier, 42 percent\n\n2008\n\nPerlmutter, 63 percent; Lerew, 37 percent", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "7th Congressional District,Bob Beauprez,Don Ytterberg,Ed Perlmutter,Joe Coors,Ryan Frazier", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "The Spot", "description": "Rep.
