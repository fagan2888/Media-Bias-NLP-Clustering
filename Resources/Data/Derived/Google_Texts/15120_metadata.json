The petition includes the controversial video about Planned Parenthood released by the Center for Medical Progress, a group that advocates against abortion.\n\nThe following is an excerpt from the petition.\n\n\u201cI, like many of you, was sickened when I saw the video of Dr. Deborah Nucatola of Planned Parenthood secretly video taped discussing selling aborted baby parts. I was more than sickened, I was enraged\u2026 Congress must act NOW! Please sign my petition to Congress demanding that they stop all public funds to Planned Parenthood.\u201d\n\nAccording to Live Action News, Margaret Sanger, the group\u2019s founder, is said to be racist. It is alleged that she at one time said that the program should be used to obliterate black people. The following is the statement.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want the word to go out that we want to exterminate the Negro population, and the minister is the man who can straighten out that idea if it ever occurs to any of their more rebellious members. \u201c\n\nThe organization is said to have received sizeable contributions for the course. After watching the video made by the Center for Medical Progress, in which Planed Parenthood is depicted as a heartless group that makes money from selling body parts, Ben Carson made the following comment.\n\n\u201cWe have reached a time where people are so desensitized where they are not horrified by this kind of activity. We\u2019ve allowed the secular progressive movement to [desensitize society] to the point where things are no longer wrong\u2026 If we can\u2019t defund Planned Parenthood after this, we are lost.\u201d\n\nBen Carson also recently attacked Obamacare saying the whole thing should be changed with the exception of one clause. And that is the one that prevents insurance companies from barring people with pre-existing conditions from joining health care programs.\n\nThe following was Ben Carson\u2019s statement, according to IJ Review.\n\n\u201cProviding coverage to people who are sick is extremely important. When I work with Congress to repeal the law, I think we should keep this protection for the sick.\u201d\n\n[Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ben Carson has been very outspoken about various policies implemented by Obama's government, as well as the now controversial Planned Parenthood organization", "og": {"site_name": "The Inquisitr News", "description": "Ben Carson has been very outspoken about various policies implemented by Obama\u2019s government, as well as the now controversial Planned Parenthood organization", "title": "Ben Carson Points Out One Part Of Obamacare That He Would Keep", "url": "http://www.inquisitr.com/2284986/ben-carson-points-out-one-part-of-obamacare-that-he-would-keep/", "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Ben_Carson3.jpg", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-26T19:52:09+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-26T20:06:03+00:00"}, "type": "article"}, "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Ben_Carson3.jpg", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "datePublished": "2015-07-26T19:52:09+00:00", "fb": {"app_id": 164157850314499, "pages": 71179904752}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/0cec37/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "keywords": "ben,carson,planned,parenthood,petition,video,people,group,congress,ben carson,news,politics", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Ben_Carson3.jpg", "height": 409, "width": 670}, "site": "@theinquisitr", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Ben Carson has been very outspoken about various policies implemented by Obama\u2019s government, as well as the now controversial Planned Parenthood organization"}, "viewport": "width=980"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca185\"", "article_summary": "Beginning with his criticism of Planned Parenthood, Ben Carson recently launched a petition against the group through his website.\nBen Carson has been very outspoken about various policies implemented by Obama\u2019s government, as well as the now controversial Planned Parenthood organization.\nThe petition includes the controversial video about Planned Parenthood released by the Center for Medical Progress, a group that advocates against abortion.\nAfter watching the video made by the Center for Medical Progress, in which Planed Parenthood is depicted as a heartless group that makes money from selling body parts, Ben Carson made the following comment.\n\u201cI, like many of you, was sickened when I saw the video of Dr. Deborah Nucatola of Planned Parenthood secretly video taped discussing selling aborted baby parts."}
