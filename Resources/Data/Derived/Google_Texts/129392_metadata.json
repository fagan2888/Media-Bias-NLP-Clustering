But when she signed a petition asking Missouri lawmakers to consider accepting Obamacare\u2019s optional Medicaid expansion to provide coverage for additional low-income residents, her request didn\u2019t elicit much sympathy from her Republican state senator, Ed Emery.\n\nHis response? If you want Medicaid expansion, just move to a different state.\n\nCole shared Emery\u2019s letter with public radio station KCUR. According to the copy that KCUR published, Emery thanked his constituent for getting in touch, but explained that he ultimately can\u2019t support Medicaid expansion because it\u2019s the wrong choice for Missouri. \u201cWe live in a nation and an era that facilitates physical moves between states. Individuals and families are free to consider moving to states with differing and even contrasting government policies,\u201d Emery wrote.\n\nThe state lawmaker told KCUR that he didn\u2019t think \u201cthere was anything in there suggesting anybody should move,\u201d but said he simply intended to point out that \u201cwe\u2019re free to move from state to state if a state has policies that we like versus policies that we don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nMissouri is one of more than 20 states that have refused to accept generous federal funding to expand their Medicaid programs, one of the key policies that the health reform law implemented to help increase the number of insured Americans. The states that have accepted the optional expansion are seeing historic drops in their uninsurance rates, as well as a host of other benefits like stable funding for hospitals in rural areas. Meanwhile, the states that have refused are preventing millions of impoverished Americans from accessing affordable insurance.\n\nAccording to a recent study conducted by Harvard researchers, most of those low-income people who are locked out of Medicaid expansion probably won\u2019t actually move to a different state to take advantage of the program. The same thing is true for generous tax breaks; people don\u2019t tend to cross state lines to take advantage of more lenient tax codes.\n\nThere are a couple reasons for that. For one thing, impoverished Americans don\u2019t always realize how they could benefit from government benefits in other states. That\u2019s particularly true for the low-income people who live in GOP-controlled states that have resisted Medicaid expansion \u2014 since their lawmakers haven\u2019t invested very many resources in education campaigns about Obamacare, those residents are less likely to understand how health reform impacts them personally.\n\nAnd perhaps more importantly, struggling Americans who are living in poverty simply don\u2019t have the resources to uproot their lives and try their luck in another state. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to understand what it is to move when you have nothing,\u201d Jennifer Laurent, the executive director of a homeless shelter in Texarkana, on the border of Texas and Arkansas, explained in a recent interview with the New York Times. \u201cTo risk everything \u2014 losing your bed, your sense of community \u2014 for an uncertain benefit? There\u2019s no way you want to risk that.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to Cole, she plans on staying put in Missouri and continuing to advocate for Medicaid expansion in her home state.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "But moving is easier said than done for impoverished Americans.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "But moving is easier said than done for impoverished Americans.", "title": "Missouri Lawmaker: If You Want Medicaid Expansion, You Should Move Somewhere Else", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/06/12/3448343/missouri-medicaid-expansion-move/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/shutterstock_146872763.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "But moving is easier said than done for impoverished Americans.", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/shutterstock_146872763-321x214.jpg", "title": "Missouri Lawmaker: If You Want Medicaid Expansion, You Should Move Somewhere Else", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/shutterstock_146872763.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/shutterstock_146872763.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-12T13:07:10+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Health Missouri Lawmaker: If You Want Medicaid Expansion, You Should Move Somewhere Else CREDIT: Shutterstock Moving is easier said than done for low-income Americans.\nThere\u2019s no way you want to risk that.\u201dWhen it comes to Cole, she plans on staying put in Missouri and continuing to advocate for Medicaid expansion in her home state.\nIf you want Medicaid expansion, just move to a different state.\nAccording to the copy that KCUR published, Emery thanked his constituent for getting in touch, but explained that he ultimately can\u2019t support Medicaid expansion because it\u2019s the wrong choice for Missouri.\nBut when she signed a petition asking Missouri lawmakers to consider accepting Obamacare\u2019s optional Medicaid expansion to provide coverage for additional low-income residents, her request didn\u2019t elicit much sympathy from her Republican state senator, Ed Emery."}
