And according to Brookings, which analyzed data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number of these jobs that made up total employment dropped from 39.1 to 36.6 from 2000 to 2013.\n\nMeanwhile, we\u2019ve known for a while that demand is rising for workers in healthcare, high tech manufacturing, and information technology. It\u2019s the kind of work that doesn\u2019t require a PhD but is dependent on special training. These are the new \u201cmiddle skill\u201d jobs, in other words.\n\nHere\u2019s the problem: Some employers can\u2019t find enough workers to do those jobs.\n\n\u201cMany economists argue that the middle is \u2018hollowing out\u2019 as a result of digital technologies and globalization that make it easy for employers to replace workers doing routine tasks,\u201d writes Harry J. Holzer of Brookings. \u201cBut many employers argue they can\u2019t fill the middle-skill jobs they have.\u201d\n\nIn Maine, changing job trends are particularly evident in the the manufacturing and health care industries. They have an almost inverse relationship to the one they had 30 years ago, according to the Maine Department of Labor.\n\n\u201cIn 1982 the 109,000 manufacturing jobs made it the largest sector, accounting for more than one quarter of wage and salary jobs. The 36,000 healthcare jobs comprised less than one tenth of jobs,\u201d the state wrote in this Maine Workforce Outlook paper [PDF link]. \u201cToday the situation is nearly reversed. We have fewer than half as many manufacturing jobs (50,000) and healthcare is now the largest employing sector, with nearly three times as many jobs (101,000).\u201d\n\nHolzer has identified three ways to more create more of these jobs and to produce more workers to fill them.\n\nSpend more money on schools that perform well\n\nBasically: The government should give more money to colleges that have higher completion rates and that produce graduates who earn more.\n\nExpand technical education and apprenticeship programs\n\nBetter career and technical education would help give hands-on work experience to the next generation of workers, Holzer said.\n\nGive companies incentive to create better jobs\n\nThe government could give better incentives to employers \u2014 like tax credits and grants, as well as giving preference in government contracts to companies that have these kinds of jobs, Holzer said. Higher minimum wage, paid leave and \u201cwork councils\u201d for non-union companies would also attract and keep workers, he said.\n\nDo you have any ideas?
