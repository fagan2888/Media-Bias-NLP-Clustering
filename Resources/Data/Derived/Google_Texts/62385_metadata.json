However, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Cologuard way back in August; the product has been available for the past few months and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has proposed covering Cologuard under Medicare. The only news, then, is that while this product exists, it might be time for patients to ask their doctors to prescribe them the test.\n\nWhen colorectal cancer is found and treated early, the five-year survival rate is about 90 percent. While early diagnosis is key to preserving lives, a colonoscopy, the most thorough screening test, is not only expensive, but it requires a patient to fast the day before while also taking diuretics. Now there's a much easier test covered under Medicare.\n\nHow Does It Work?\n\nCologuard uses DNA technology to look for abnormalities in your stool. Since the lining of your colon naturally sheds cells, if you have cancer or precancer cells in your colon, they will be picked up by stool as it passes through your colon. A patient who is prescribed the Cologuard test by a doctor will simply place a stool sample in the collection kit and then send the kit to the lab at Exact Sciences (the manufacturer) for testing in a pre-paid mailer \u2014 much like returning a Netflix video.\n\nImportantly, Cologuard does not require any preparation: no fasting, dietary restrictions, or diuretics necessary. Patients learn of their results, through their doctors, in as little as two weeks. If the test is positive, a patient will verify the results by undergoing a colonoscopy. Though Cologuard tests for altered DNA, it is not a genetic test and does not provide information on inherited risk.\n\nAccording to the FDA, a clinical trial that screened 10,023 people compared the performance of Cologuard against the fecal immunochemical test (FIT), a commonly used stool test for screening colorectal cancers. Cologuard detected 92 percent of colorectal cancers and 42 percent of advanced polyps, compared to the FIT screening test, which detected 74 percent of cancers and 24 percent of advanced polyps.\n\nCMS proposes to cover Cologuard once every three years for beneficiaries who meet all of these criteria:\n\nAge 50 to 85 years,\n\nAsymptomatic, and\n\nAt average risk of developing colorectal cancer. This means a patient has no personal history of polyps, colorectal cancer, or inflammatory bowel disease, including Crohn\u2019s and ulcerative colitis, while also having no family history of colorectal cancers and polyps.\n\nOne in 20 (or five percent) Americans will be diagnosed with colorectal cancer. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates regular screening of everyone over the age of 50 would prevent up to 60 percent of all deaths from colorectal cancer.
