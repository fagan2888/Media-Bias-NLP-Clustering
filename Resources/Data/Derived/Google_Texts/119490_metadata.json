After beginning her writing career at 16 as a junior columnist for the local paper, Mary spent several years living, working and studying in southwestern Mexico before returning to the United States to finish her studies. Mary has written content for \"The Daily Caller,\" the Mercury One project launch , and the SPCAI\u2019s Operation Baghdad Pups, among other projects. She also served on the proofing team for a book on the history of socialism written by a former member of the CIA under Ronald Reagan. Today she runs a political commentary blog at www.afuturefree.com . Because Mary happens to be a millennial and a woman, she never tires of shocking those who assume she must\u2014by nature\u2014be a liberal. She currently resides with her husband and their dog in Minnesota where she continues to work on a book of immigrants\u2019 stories.\n\nIn just mere weeks, we\u2019ll welcome our baby daughter into the world. Somewhere between the flurry of nurses, doctors, anesthesiologists, and specialists, there will be a stern looking man with a stamp in his hand.\n\nAs the doctors are done cleaning her up and just before they hand her to me, the stern looking man will stamp her little diaper in bright red permanent ink: \u201cProperty of the Federal Government.\u201c\n\nOk, ok\u2014so it\u2019s a ridiculous example.\n\nThere will be no stern looking man; no ominous red stamp.\n\nThe sad thing is, we\u2019ve got leaders in some of the highest offices in the country who think this level of cradle-to-grave intervention in the lives of our children is a necessary consideration.\n\nEnter Education Secretary Arne Duncan.\n\n\u201cOne idea that I threw out \u2026 is this idea of public boarding schools. That\u2019s a little bit of a different idea, a controversial idea. But the question is\u2014do we have some children where there\u2019s not a mom, there\u2019s not a dad, there\u2019s not a grandma, there\u2019s just nobody at home? There\u2019s just certain kids we should have 24/7 to really create a safe environment and give them a chance to be successful.\u201d\n\nIn other words, remove certain children from any remnant of a family unit all together, and turn him/her over to be raised by the government.\n\nSecretary Duncan certainly isn\u2019t alone.\n\nAs The Federalist\u2019s Joy Pullman recently noted, the concept is taking root in states like New York and Wisconsin, where the push for \u201cfull time\u201d and \u201cboarding school\u201d scenarios are being discussed as legitimate responses to society\u2019s family unit problems.\n\nPullman aptly described these full service schools as a \u201ceuphemism for \u2018take over basically every salient aspect of parenting.\u2019\u201c\n\nYou know, there\u2019s a reason why we don\u2019t want orphaned kids to stay permanently in orphanages. After all\u2014if the government could do a better job raising children than a family\u2014why bother finding them homes? The fact is that children need a stable family home.\n\nTo Duncan\u2019s point, he\u2019s not necessarily talking about orphaned children; at least it would seem he\u2019s talking about kids in a rough situation. Maybe dad\u2019s not around; maybe mom works three jobs; maybe grandma is trying to raise her irresponsible, thoughtless daughter\u2019s multiple children.\n\nAnd this, in Duncan\u2019s mind, is the solution.\n\nDo we have a broken family problem in the United States? Yes, and it\u2019s growing.\n\nDo we have an increasingly unstable youth population in this country? Yes.\n\nSo, is a government-run \u201cfamily unit\u201d the answer?\n\nLet\u2019s break this down.\n\nThe Commonsense Concerns\n\nI want to challenge you for a moment. Set all political opinions aside, and just consider your own personal experiences. Can you\u2014in all honesty\u2014name a government entity at virtually any level that operates efficiently?\n\nFrom the Department of Motor Vehicles to the United States Immigration and Naturalization Services, there\u2019s certainly no shortage in inefficient operations.\n\nConsider just a few examples.\n\nUSA Today once pointed out that \u201cit takes 10 different offices at the Department of Health and Human Services to run programs addressing AIDS in minority communities. Autism research is spread out over 11 different agencies. Eight agencies at the Defense Department are looking for prisoners of war and missing in action. And Schriever Air Force Base in Colorado has eight different satellite control centers to control 10 satellite programs.\u201d\n\nIn its most recent report, the Government Accountability Office \u201cidentified 12 new areas of fragmentation, overlap, and duplication in federal programs and activities. \u201c (emphasis mine)\n\nOur nation\u2019s veterans are dying waiting for the care promised them through the Veterans Affairs, and despite the Obama administration\u2019s adamant promises to rectify the situation, the problem remains largely unresolved.\n\nConsider also the epic failure that was just the launch of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nSpecific to this discussion, our academic standing in the world is abysmal, especially given the fact that we\u2019ve long held (though are slowly but surely losing) the position of preeminent super power in the world. Yet the school systems we spend myriad dollars place us, as Pew Research put it, \u201caround the middle of the pack in international comparisons, and behind many other advanced industrial nations.\n\nAnd yet despite this, the bright idea isn\u2019t to get government out of the way of better solutions, but to create bigger, broader, farther-reaching programs\u2014like full time schools.\n\nThe Deeper Implications\n\n\u201c. . . And what\u2019s happened in our economy is that those who are doing better and better \u2014 more skilled, more educated, luckier, having greater advantages\u2013 are withdrawing from sort of the commons \u2014 kids start going to private schools; kids start working out at private clubs instead of the public parks. An anti-government ideology then disinvests from those common goods and those things that draw us together. And that, in part, contributes to the fact that there\u2019s less opportunity for our kids, all of our kids.\u201d \u2013President Barack Obama in remarks given at Georgetown University\n\nWe can talk all day about how our test scores stink, our inner city schools are failing, and how our education dollars are going down the drain.\n\nBut I want you to consider the deeper ideological underpinnings of an idea like Duncan\u2019s, especially given that the man for whom he works seems to think that private school is partially behind the poverty and inequality problems he believes exist.\n\nSo here\u2019s the bigger question: do we need to consider that maybe this goes beyond wanting to purportedly help children in a tough spot?\n\nAfter all, the president himself believes that private school fosters a sort of mentality that isn\u2019t exactly \u201csimpatico\u201d with the ideology of big government. He\u2019s been quite vocal about his feeling that those who disagree with him politically are second-class citizens.\n\nConsider also that a woman who wants to be the next president of the United States made no bones about the fact that she thinks some of us will have to change our \u201cdeep-seated cultural codes, religious beliefs and structural biases.\u201d\n\nSo, what happens when parents like my husband and I choose to teach our daughter that our world was created in seven days (something some call child abuse); that marriage is between a man and a woman (a belief now viewed as hateful); that small government is an ideal government (a sentiment that is now compared to radicalism)?\n\nWould someone like Arne Duncan consider us to be parents who aren\u2019t \u201caround\u201d for their child?\n\nIt seems implausible. But then again, I\u2019d wager that\u2019s how most government overreaches start out.\n\nInstead of talking about the growing fragmentation of families in this country, and rather than addressing the fact that our economy is stagnate (which, crazy enough, has a rather large impact on poverty levels in this country), we\u2019re talking about making government and its so-called solutions even bigger.\n\nAnswer me this: why is the default to assume that we need MORE government? And since government is wildly successful at demonstrating that its solutions hardly ever solve the problems it purports to resolve\u2014what is the push really about?\n\nIt\u2019s certainly something to ponder.\n\nMary Ramirez is a full-time writer, creator of www.afuturefree.com (a political commentary blog), and contributor to The Chris Salcedo Show (TheBlaze Radio Network, Saturday, from noon to 3 p.m. ET).
