Talk about raising the roof.

The Circus Vargas big top went up at the Ventura County Fairgrounds on Tuesday, a well-choreographed maneuver that takes 20 people and seven hours.

Circus officials call the setup of the massive canvas tent “an intricate puzzle,” as tens of thousands of square feet of blue and yellow canvas fabric, dozens of poles, hundreds of stakes and miles of rope and cable are put into place.

It’s an exercise played out — then reversed — as the circus makes its way through Southern California.
