Councilor Jim Weygand was absent.\n\nCouncilors reviewed Mareck\u2019s original proposal for the 2016 general fund budget and preliminary tax levy on Aug. 17 and his revised proposals Sept. 8 and Monday. They liked the progress they saw.\n\nAt the start of council budget and levy talks Aug. 17, Mareck proposed the levy be raised 6.4 percent to $2,121,409 in 2016. But he later whittled budget spending during his follow-up proposals, which lowered the levy increase to 4.8 percent in his latest proposal Monday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m as pleased as I can be,\u201d Webb said after the council meeting Monday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve gone through it and I can\u2019t find anything I would change,\u201d Monroe said during the council\u2019s work session Sept. 8.\n\nMoving forward, councilors are allowed to reduce the property tax levy before adopting the 2016 city budget and certifying the final levy, but they cannot raise the levy above the preliminary amount set Monday.\n\nThe Truth-in-Taxation public hearing about the 2016 city budget and tax levy is scheduled during the council meeting Dec. 7 in Church-By-The-River, 109 Main Street East. Councilors intend to adopt the budget and certify the final levy that night after the public hearing.\n\nCarver city government receives about one-third of property taxes paid by city homeowners and businesses. The rest goes to School District 112, Carver County government and several smaller taxing agencies.\n\nMareck this month provided the City Council with estimates showing the property tax for city government increasing $40 next year on a home valued at $200,000, increasing $61 next year on a home valued at $300,000 and increasing $81 next year on a home valued at $400,000.\n\nHis latest general fund budget for 2016 is $2,606,615, which is 3.9 percent more than the $2,509,359 budget this year.\n\nMareck advised councilors Monday in a background memo that more revisions to the proposed general fund budget will be presented to them for their review before the Truth-in-Taxation public hearing.\n\nThe general fund budget pays for city government daily operations and making payments on prior loans the City Council took for major construction projects and major equipment purchases.\n\nProperty taxes are slated to finance about 81 percent of the city\u2019s general fund budget next year. That would be down from 82 percent this year.\n\nLoan payments are scheduled to increase $78,613 from $386,886 this year to $465,499 next year. The major reason for that increase is next year will be the first payment for the loan taken this year to rebuild Oak Street North, Fifth Street East and Sixth Street East and to buy two snow plows and a utility vehicle.\n\nSalaries and wages for the city\u2019s 13 full-time employees are slated to cost $46,710 more in 2016 because of two-part pay raises the workers are expected to receive in January. The City Council already approved a 2 percent cost-of-living increase. The city\u2019s pay scale formula would provide an additional 2.75 percent pay increase because current employees will advance one step on the scale next year.\n\nMareck also proposes that officers of the Carver Fire & Rescue Department receive their first pay raise in several years, ranging from a $1,500 increase for Fire Chief Dan Meyer to a new level of $5,000 per year to $400 increases for all captains and lieutenants that would raise pay for each to $1,500 per year.\n\nAfter two years of the city enjoying stable or declining premiums for employee health insurance, Mareck received disappointing news that Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota intends to raise premiums in 2016 that would cost the city $20,396 more to continue existing terms of coverage. Part of the blame for the big boost falls on the federal law officially known as the Affordable Care Act but commonly called Obamacare.\n\n\u201cPremiums are expected to increase by 17.5 percent in 2016 based on the city\u2019s experience rating and impacts related to the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Mareck wrote in a slide presentation to councilors Sept. 8. \u201cStaff will be investigating changes to the plan to mitigate the impact of the 17.5 percent premium increase.\u201d\n\nThe general fund budget does not include separate budgets for utility operations financed primarily by consumption fees charged existing customers and hook-up fees imposed on new customers. Mareck is scheduled to present his proposed water, sanitary sewer and storm water budgets to the City Council on Oct. 19.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "SWNewsMedia.com", "description": "Property taxes for Carver city government may increase 4.8 percent next year.", "title": "Carver council looks at 4.8 percent property tax increase for 2016", "url": "http://www.swnewsmedia.com/chaska_herald/carver-council-looks-at-percent-property-tax-increase-for/article_742793bd-5963-5331-a2f3-d6739cd524d8.html", "image": {"width": 760, "identifier": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/swnewsmedia.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/1/44/1446c234-7968-51c9-a40c-86554991c61b/5422ff62b9ba5.image.jpg?resize=760%2C569", "height": 569}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@townnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@"}, "description": "Property taxes for Carver city government may increase 4.8 percent next year.", "fb": {"admins": 1494255107496110, "app_id": 1463538783914736}, "keywords": "#chsenews,chaska_herald,news,local,top_story", "news_keywords": "#chsenews,chaska_herald,news,local,top_story"}, "article_summary": "The City Council voted 4-0 Monday to set the 2016 preliminary property tax levy at $2,089,456, which is $96,014 more than the 2015 final levy of $1,993,442.\nCouncilors reviewed Mareck\u2019s original proposal for the 2016 general fund budget and preliminary tax levy on Aug. 17 and his revised proposals Sept. 8 and Monday.\nHis latest general fund budget for 2016 is $2,606,615, which is 3.9 percent more than the $2,509,359 budget this year.\nMareck is scheduled to present his proposed water, sanitary sewer and storm water budgets to the City Council on Oct. 19.\nThe Truth-in-Taxation public hearing about the 2016 city budget and tax levy is scheduled during the council meeting Dec. 7 in Church-By-The-River, 109 Main Street East."}
