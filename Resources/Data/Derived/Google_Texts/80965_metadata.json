Photo: Phil Carrick\n\nSocial Services Minister Scott Morrison is open to updating online betting laws to keep pace with technology changes but warns wagering operators he will not approve any change that compromises Australia's sports and racing industries or leads to new risks for problem gamblers.\n\nThe federal government on Monday issued the terms of reference for a review into the Interactive Gambling Act, which will look at how to handle surging demand for new methods of live sports betting along with the regulation and taxation of illegal overseas operators.\n\nThe potential for in-play wagering to compromise our national sports and racing industry can't be underestimated. Scott Morrison\n\nFormer NSW premier Barry O'Farrell will conduct the review with final recommendations due to be submitted to Mr Morrison and Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull by December 18.\n\nSocial Services Minister Scott Morrison is concerned by an Australian Institute of Family Studies report showing problem gambling rates are three times higher among online gamblers.

There are technological issues there which need to be considered.\"\n\nThe issue of problem gamblers falls under the minister's social services portfolio.\n\nMr Morrison said he was concerned by an Australian Institute of Family Studies report showing problem gambling rates are three times higher among online gamblers than traditional betting methods.\n\nOne of the key sticking points in the industry is the controversial in-play betting system, promoted by international players William Hill and Bet 365, which allows punters to bet live on sports via their smartphones.\n\nPunters in Australia can bet on the outcome of an event after it has begun but only via the telephone or in person.\n\nHowever, companies like William Hill claim that as long as punters keep their smartphone microphone on, it still adheres to the rule that live bets during sporting events are made by phone only.\n\nBritish rival Ladbrokes withdrew its in-play betting service in July after complaints to the Australian Communications and Media Authority; and William Hill, headed locally by Tom Waterhouse, may face an investigation by the Australian Federal Police following a similar referral.\n\nThe review will seek to estimate the size and economic impacts of illegal overseas wagering; international regulatory regimes that could provide a template for Australia; new technological and legislative options to mitigate the costs of illegal wagering; and whether consumer protections could be strengthened.\n\nMr Morrison said overseas wagering generated $1 billion in illegal revenue each year and more must be done to address enforcement in the sector, noting other countries have tapped financial and telecommunication legislation to help act on the issue.\n\n\"Australian-headquartered organisations are attempting to avoid legal obligations by basing their operations in unregulated international regions such as the Pacific and Asia,\" notes the terms of reference. \"By avoiding the proper checks and balances and evading the fees, this arrangement has the potential to undermine the integrity of racing and sports in Australia.\"\n\nLast week Independent senator Nick Xenophon urged the federal government to ban gambling advertising during live sport broadcasts.\n\nHe is also calling to restrict a controversial online betting loophole as part of an impending review of the IGA.\n\nMr Xenophon said he was drafting legislation to be introduced in October as part of a reform package.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Gambling, Scott Morrison, Interactive Gambling Act, Tatts, Tabcorp, William Hill, Sportsbet, Ubet", "application-name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "og": {"site_name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "description": "Social Services Minister Scott Morrison is open to updating online betting laws to keep pace with technology changes.", "title": "Wagering firms face uncertainty as government reviews sector", "url": "http://www.smh.com.au/business/the-economy/wagering-firms-face-uncertainty-as-government-reviews-sector-20150907-gjgwhb.html", "image": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/g/i/r/2/m/o/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.gjgwhb.png/1441674075971.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@smh", "image": {"src": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/g/i/r/2/m/o/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.gjgwhb.png/1441674075971.jpg"}, "description": "Social Services Minister Scott Morrison is open to updating online betting laws to keep pace with technology changes.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Wagering firms face uncertainty as government reviews sector"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Open The Sydney Morning Herald", "robots": "ACAP allow-present prohibited-modification=annotation", "fb": {"app_id": 193677504039845}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.smh.com.au", "msapplication-task": "name=Weather;action-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/weather;icon-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/favicon.ico;", "description": "Social Services Minister Scott Morrison is open to updating online betting laws to keep pace with technology changes."}, "article_summary": "The potential for in-play wagering to compromise our national sports and racing industry can't be underestimated.\nAdvertisement\"The potential for in-play wagering to compromise our national sports and racing industry can't be underestimated,\" Mr Morrison said.\nHe is also calling to restrict a controversial online betting loophole as part of an impending review of the IGA.\nOne of the key sticking points in the industry is the controversial in-play betting system.\nBritish rival Ladbrokes withdrew its in-play betting service in July after complaints to the Australian Communications and Media Authority; and William Hill, headed locally by Tom Waterhouse, may face an investigation by the Australian Federal Police following a similar referral."}
