Mark Pryor, D-Ark., who is up for reelection next year and is feeling the heat for his support of Obamacare.\n\nIn the ad, Pryor is pictured holding a Bible as he declares his belief in God \u2014 it\u2019s only \u201cBible-thumping\u201d when a conservative does it.\n\n\u201cThe basic tenet in America is the separation,\u201d Walters offered. \u201cAnd it\u2019s very important.

You see it again and again. You don\u2019t have to use a Bible.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe talk about the separation between church and state and almost every president ends up saying so help me God,\u201d Walters further grumbled.\n\nWalters fails to mention that the words \u201cseparation\u201d, \u201cchurch\u201d and \u201cstate\u201d do not appear in the First Amendment, or that when Thomas Jefferson first referenced the expression in a letter to the Danbury Baptist Association of Connecticut, the wall he spoke of was to protect the church from the state.\n\nPerhaps Walters, 83, should move up that retirement date.\n\n[poll id=\u201d144\u2033]", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "BizPac Review", "description": "During a discussion Thursday on ABC\u2019s \u201cThe View,\u201d host Barbara Walters bemoaned the fact that most politicians use a Bible when taking the oath of office.
