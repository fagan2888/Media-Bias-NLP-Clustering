The billboards are part of an advertising effort to inform potential patients that the clinic is there and it has a doctor.\n\nAsked who he treats, Floyd says, \u201cAnybody who walks through the door.\u201d\n\nBarbara Myers, the CEO of the clinic, said only about 30 percent have some sort of insurance including Medicare, Medicaid or insurance from the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cThey rest are uninsured. Most of them fall through the cracks\u2019\u2019 in traditional health care, she said.\n\nSome work but make too much to qualify for subsidized care or they earn too little to afford premiums, Myers said.\n\n\u201cIf they can pay the premiums, they can\u2019t afford the high deductibles so they may as well not be insured,\u2019\u2019 Myers said.\n\nIf they can pay but have limited means, the fee is based on a sliding scale. Those who can\u2019t pay and have no insurance still treated, she said.\n\nAnd Medicare isn\u2019t always as free as many think.\n\n\u201cThere are an awful lot of people on Medicare who can\u2019t afford the copayment, which we\u2019ve seen as high as $40. Sometimes, we can waive that,\u2019\u2019 Myers said.\n\nTo fill the cracks in the system, the clinic is funded by a grant from the Department of Health and Human Services and overseen by the Health Resource Services Administration.\n\nAs Floyd says, \u201cTheir job is to give money to people like us who take care of people who don\u2019t have insurance or can\u2019t afford to pay.\u201d\n\nThe health center opened officially the last day of February 2014 with a nurse practitioner. It had a part-time physician from July until Floyd arrived in June.\n\nFloyd spent three years in the Navy \u2014 primarily delivering babies, he says \u2014 and 10 in private practice. Before coming to Brunswick a couple of months ago, he was working in family medicine in Williamsburg, Va.\n\nHe sees a lot of the same sorts of things in Brunswick he has seen before, obesity, heart disease, diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol, many of them the result of poor eating habits and a lack of exercise, Floyd said.\n\nBut at the clinic they tend to be worse, he said, because the patients haven\u2019t had access to health care for such a long time.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen things I haven\u2019t seen since medical school. In medical school you see the worst of the worst,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\n\u201cHypertension, diabetes are just terrible\u2019\u2019 among his patients, Floyd said.\n\nHe also tells people what to do to reverse \u2014 or at least ease \u2014 some of their health issues, but some don\u2019t take it very well.\n\n\u201cWhen I tell people they need to exercise, they look at me like they\u2019ve never heard that before,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThere are times, though, when medicines are needed that the poor just can\u2019t afford.\n\n\u201cPeople have seizures who can\u2019t afford available anti-convulsants,\u2019\u2019 Floyd said, \u201calthough many of them are cheap.\u201d\n\nCoastal Community Health Center isn\u2019t the only clinic that can help the indigent. Southeast Georgia Health System has a number of them in the area.\n\nFloyd said the challenge for all primary care physicians who help the needy is getting them to specialists when it is necessary.\n\n\u201cNot one physician can know everything or can do everything that needs to be done,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a collaborative effort to care for people. That\u2019s why we went to med school. That\u2019s why we\u2019re in the business.\u201d\n\nAsked why he went to medical school, Floyd said it was a departure from the family business, which is business.\n\n\u201cWhen I was 5, I had to have surgery, a tonsillectomy, and I enjoyed it,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nHe wanted to be like his surgeon, but he lost that desire in medical school at the University of Maryland, he said.\n\nBorn in Martinsburg, W. Va., he grew up in Hagerstown and Baltimore, Md. He saw many of his classmates graduate after four years, go into business and buy houses and cars while he was still in school.\n\nNow 51, he and his wife have a 22-year-old son who graduated from Savannah College of Art and Design. Floyd said he and his wife enjoy ballroom dancing although they haven\u2019t found a place to dance in Brunswick.\n\nHe knows that there are some in the medical profession just for the money, but then there are others, \u201cguys in the trenches,\u2019\u2019 he calls them, working every day treating illnesses.\n\n\u201cI think most of us are driven by that desire, to help people in need,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nMyers said she expects Floyd to need help soon with the clinic seeing 17 to 20 patients a day.\n\nTerry Dickson: (912) 264-0405", "article_metadata": {"description": "BRUNSWICK | Recently, an image of Jay Floyd has been smiling down from billboards onto a lot of city streets.That sort of advertising space is normally taken up by insurance agents and lawyers looking for paying customers, but Floyd is a physician looking for people who don\u2019t have much money, if they have any at all.", "application-name": "Jacksonville.com", "og": {"site_name": "jacksonville.com", "description": "BRUNSWICK | Recently, an image of Jay Floyd has been smiling down from billboards onto a lot of city streets.", "title": "Doctor's clientele: 'Anybody who walks through the door'", "url": "http://jacksonville.com/news/georgia/2015-07-25/story/doctors-clientele-anybody-who-walks-through-door", "image": "http://jacksonville.com/sites/default/files/14589062.jpg", "type": "article"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#426ab2", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://jacksonville.com/files/img/editorial/Win8Tiles/Win8icon70x70tiny1.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://jacksonville.com/files/img/editorial/Win8Tiles/Win8iconLarge1.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://jacksonville.com/files/img/editorial/Win8Tiles/wide310x150.png", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://jacksonville.com/files/img/Win8icon.png", "keywords": "Georgia, News", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://jacksonville.com/files/img/editorial/Win8Tiles/Win8icon150x150square1.png", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"msm-image150": "http://jacksonville.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/cxense150x111/14589062.jpg", "msm-image319": "http://jacksonville.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/cxense319x185/14589062.jpg", "articleid": 654669, "publishtime": "2015-07-25T21:58:35Z", "msm-image320": "http://jacksonville.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/cxense320/14589062.jpg"}}}, "article_summary": "\u201cIf they can pay the premiums, they can\u2019t afford the high deductibles so they may as well not be insured,\u2019\u2019 Myers said.\nThat\u2019s why we\u2019re in the business.\u201dAsked why he went to medical school, Floyd said it was a departure from the family business, which is business.\nMost of them fall through the cracks\u2019\u2019 in traditional health care, she said.\nHe wanted to be like his surgeon, but he lost that desire in medical school at the University of Maryland, he said.\n\u201cThere are an awful lot of people on Medicare who can\u2019t afford the copayment, which we\u2019ve seen as high as $40."}
