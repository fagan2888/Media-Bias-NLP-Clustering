John Kasich on Thursday laid out part of his agenda if elected to the White House, saying he plans to balance the federal budget in eight years, cut taxes while boosting military spending and return power from the federal government to the states in areas such as education.\n\nMr. Kasich, a 2016 GOP presidential candidate, was speaking at Nashua Community College in New Hampshire \u2014 a state that figures to be crucial for his campaign going forward.\n\n\u201cFolks, all the politics, all the focus groups, all the polls, all the TV ratings need to go out the window, and we need to come together,\u201d Mr. Kasich said. \u201cTalk is cheap \u2014 standing on a corner and yelling and screaming is like a clanging bell if you cannot accomplish anything.\u201d\n\nMr. Kasich, who helped craft the last balanced budget plan during the 1990s as chairman of the House Budget Committee, said cutting taxes while balancing the budget is possible with the right conditions in place for economic growth.\n\n\u201cWe will not only cut taxes, but we will balance our budget in eight years \u2014 both of them,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause to balance a budget, you need economic growth while at the same time you manage your spending. Both of them lead us to a balanced budget, which ultimately can lead us to a place where we can begin to pay down our national debt.\u201d\n\nMr. Kasich called for cutting the top individual income tax rate from 39.6 percent to 28 percent, eliminating the estate tax, increasing the earned income tax credit by 10 percent and cutting the top business tax rate from 35 percent to 25 percent.\n\n\u201cThis looks like a pretty big tax cut for the top end and a little bit at the bottom,\u201d said Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. \u201cThere\u2019s not much going to the middle class.\u201d\n\nIn an interview before his speech, Mr. Kasich said, \u201cIf you are a person that thinks you ought to pound the rich into submission, I guess you won\u2019t like the plan.\u201d\n\nOn spending, Mr. Kasich would limit the federal role in education, transportation, job training and Medicaid. Dollars now dedicated to those programs would go into large grants for state leaders to manage.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sending all the programs in the federal government back,\u201d he said.\n\nHe does propose cuts to Medicare that would slow the growth rate of the health care program for more than 50 million elderly and disabled people.\n\nThe plan is cause for optimism among some who questioned Mr. Kasich\u2019s commitment to fiscal conservatism after he expanded Medicaid eligibility in Ohio as part of the federal health overhaul, said Grover Norquist, the president of Americans for Tax Reform and a former Kasich critic.\n\nMr. Norquist called it \u201ca grown-up approach\u201d on spending and \u201csignificantly pro-growth\u201d on taxes. He said Mr. Kasich\u2019s policies were more practical than some plans that call for blowing up the existing tax system.\n\n\u201cEverything on his plate is doable, is achievable,\u201d Mr. Norquist said.\n\nDemocratic National Committee spokesman T.J. Helmstetter called Mr. Kasich\u2019s plan \u201csimply unserious.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt would not balance the budget, but it would choke off critical programs that people depend on and cripple the federal government\u2019s ability to function,\u201d Mr. Helmstetter said. \u201cIt would either explode the deficit or destroy the economy.\u201d\n\nMr. Kasich is running seventh nationally and sixth in New Hampshire in the latest RealClearPolitics averages of recent polling on the 2016 GOP field.\n\nOne of the only spending increases he is pitching would go to the military. Mr. Kasich wants to boost military spending by $102 billion, or 17 percent, between 2017 and 2025.\n\nMr. Kasich also said there can be no balanced budget without \u201cdealing with the problem of entitlements \u2014 to change those entitlements in such a way that we can make them sustainable but yet delivering the services that our people need.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have done that before, and we will do it again,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2981 This story is based in part on wire service dispatches.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ohio Gov.
