Additionally, the law will cost 29% less for the 2015-2019 time frame than the CBO\u2019s initial forecast when the law was signed in March 2010.\n\nThe CBO cites two reasons for the decline in costs: reductions in both private health insurance premiums and the number of Americans expected to sign up for Medicaid and subsidized insurance under the law\u2019s marketplaces. Before the law took effect, the agency predicted more people than anticipated had private coverage and fewer companies than anticipated were canceling coverage.\n\n\u201cThe slower growth has been sufficiently broad and persistent,\u201d said the congressional agency.\n\nBy 2025, the CBO estimates \u201cthe total number of people who will be uninsured\u2026 is now expected to be smaller than previously projected,\u201d and three million fewer people are expected to sign up for the Affordable Care Act.\n\nOver the last few years, the costs have continued to drop. In March 2010, the CBO first predicted the law would cost $710 billion from 2015 to 2019. But Monday\u2019s projection announced that the law is now expected to cost $506 billion.\n\nThe agency also updated its projection on the number of people who will be without health insurance by 2025 from 27 million to around 25 million. The report also shows lower enrollment than originally expected in federal and state exchanges set up by Obamacare. According to the Obama administration, 11.4 million people have signed up for private insurance through the exchanges so far in 2015.\n\nThese estimates have been announced less than a week after the Supreme Court heard a case challenging a major provision of the law regarding federal subsidies for states that refused to open their own state-run exchanges.\n\nClose video ACA goes back to court In the latest showdown over the ACA, plaintiffs argued that the law provides financial subsidies to those purchasing health insurance through federal-run exchanges offered in states that did not create their own marketplaces.
