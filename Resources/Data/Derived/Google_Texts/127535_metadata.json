Under this new standard, franchise owners like Stockeland expect to incur additional liability and management cost.\n\nWith over 780,000 franchises generating nearly 3 percent of national GDP according to the National Franchise Association, the NLRB\u2019s new definition could have significant consequences.\n\nOpponents fear that the increased regulatory burden will crowd out opportunity for small business across the country.\n\nAt Tuesday\u2019s hearing, Chairman Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., warned that the NLRB\u2019s \u201cnew joint standard will make big business bigger and the middle class smaller by discouraging larger companies from franchising and contracting work to small business.\u201d\n\nThe Tennessee senator said the decision \u201cthreatens to steal the American dream \u2026 and destroys the free enterprise, entrepreneurial spirit,\u201d of the nation.\n\nTo undo that danger, Alexander urged support for his \u201cProtecting Local Business Opportunity Act.\u201d The legislation would amend the National Labor Relations Act to define a joint employer only if a company exercised \u201cactual, direct, and immediate\u201d control over a contracted or franchised worker. That bill, S. 2015, already has 46 cosponsors and corresponding legislation in the House.\n\nSome Democrats argue that Republican reaction to the decision has been overblown. They maintain that large corporations have used franchises and contractors as avenues to export accountability.\n\n\u201cSome big businesses have figured out how to dodge responsibility,\u201d said Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. \u201cA parent company enjoys the right to make managing decisions but without the obligation to respect collective bargaining rights.\u201d\n\nMichael Ruben, a San Francisco lawyer who also testified, remained adamant that these rules wouldn\u2019t have an impact on small businesses. Asked if a franchisor would be liable when simply offering training and branding, Ruben advised that the NLRB would evaluate \u201con a case-by-case basis.\u201d\n\nTuring to Stockeland, Ruben said, \u201cI can say with confidence that this would not be a problem for you and your franchise.\u201d\n\nShe wasn\u2019t convinced.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no definition for who decides if a franchisor is big or small,\u201d she responded. \u201cI don\u2019t want the liability of having to run and operate employees and obey labor standards across multiple stores.\u201d\n\nAfter the hearing, Stockeland told The Daily Signal that \u201cthere\u2019s still no clarity,\u201d and \u201cit\u2019s a very broad definition.\u201d\n\nAlthough the franchisor of a dozen different boutiques across the Midwest, she employs only ten employees directly in Fargo, N.D. The individual franchises make their own hiring and firing decisions.\n\nStockeland chose the franchise model because she didn\u2019t feel that managing remotely would be fair or efficient. \u201cI really decided to franchise because I couldn\u2019t manage employees from a distance. If I would\u2019ve grown, I would have had to manage employees from hours away.\u201d\n\nAnd from the beginning, she wanted to start a business, not \u201cjust a single store as a hobby.\u201d But looking back, she says, \u201cI absolutely would not have been as eager\u201d to begin a business under the new NLRB standard.\n\n\u201cThe uncertainty of not knowing what this liability could mean for me and my family would stunt my growth,\u201d she predicts.\n\nShe says she\u2019s already felt the impact of the NLRB decision and hears \u201cchatter of not knowing what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d\n\nWhen starting up, Stockeland remembers waking up in the middle of the night to double-check her bank account, worrying that she might not make rent that month. Though successful now, Sotckeland didn\u2019t turn a profit for the first eight years.\n\n\u201cYou have enough to worry about as a small business owner,\u201d she explained. \u201cLet\u2019s not add to that environment, where you constantly have to worry more because there might be a lawsuit.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "She says her business is \"facing serious uncertainty.\"", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "She says her business is \"facing serious uncertainty.\"", "title": "Small Business Owner Fears New Ruling on Franchises Could Hurt Company", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/mode1.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-10-07T23:19:42+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1FXzXS9"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "She says her business is \"facing serious uncertainty.\"", "title": "Small Business Owner Fears New Ruling on Franchises Could Hurt Company", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/mode1.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "regulation", "published_time": "2015-10-07T18:39:41+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-07T23:19:42+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cYou have enough to worry about as a small business owner,\u201d she explained.\nOpponents fear that the increased regulatory burden will crowd out opportunity for small business across the country.\nThe granddaughter and daughter of entrepreneurs, Stockeland became a third-generation small business owner when she founded and successfully franchised Mode, a female fashion boutique.\nWith over 780,000 franchises generating nearly 3 percent of national GDP according to the National Franchise Association, the NLRB\u2019s new definition could have significant consequences.\nEven when she was still young, Ciara Stockeland knew she wanted to open her own business."}
