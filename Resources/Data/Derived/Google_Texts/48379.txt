There's no love lost between these Canadian-born Americans.

Toronto-born comedian Samantha Bee had harsh — but hilarious — words for Ted Cruz on Monday's episode of "Full Frontal," as the latter seeks the Republican nomination to run for the U.S. presidency.

Bee, a former "Daily Show" correspondent, pulled no punches as she gave a tough lesson in "Cruz 101."

She acknowledged the kind words his university colleagues used to describe the Calgary native:

"Ted's classmates at Princeton and Harvard Law fondly remember him as 'arrogant,' 'pretentious' and a 'nightmare of a human being.'"

She talked about how much his underlings enjoyed working for him in Texas:

"When Ted was solicitor-general of Texas, half of the eight attorneys in the office quit."

But the most striking blow was her assessment of Cruz's performance in a Harvard Law production of Arthur Miller's "The Crucible."

"Yes, that squeally French mime actually was Ted Cruz."

She summed up her monologue by saying that "even God" doesn't want to talk directly to Ted Cruz.

You can discover for yourself how she arrives at that conclusion. (Watch video above.)

"Full Frontal with Samantha Bee" premiered on TBS last month, and she's already drawn rave reviews for her scathing jokes directed at American politicians.

In a segment from last week, she (very cleverly) asked whether Republican politicians are "too emotional" to be president.

Bee is the second of two "Daily Show" alums — alongside John Oliver — to fill the late-night satirical comedy void that remained when Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert left "The Daily Show" and "The Colbert Report," respectively.

It's wonderful to see a Canadian deliver jokes so well — even if it comes at a former Canadian's expense.
