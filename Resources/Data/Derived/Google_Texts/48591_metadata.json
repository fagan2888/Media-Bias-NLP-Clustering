Al Sharpton\u2019s controversial role as an alleged FBI informant in the 1980s, President Barack Obama showered him with praise at Mr. Sharpton\u2019s National Action Network conference.\n\n\u201cIt is good to be at the National Action Network,\u201d Mr. Obama said when he took the stage in a Midtown hotel ballroom. \u201cI want to say first of all thank you to your leader Rev. Al Sharpton, give him a big round of applause.\u201d\n\nAfter Mr. Sharpton introduced Mr. Obama as someone who is about action and not just \u201cstyle,\u201d Mr. Obama gently ribbed the reverend.\n\n\u201cI appreciate that he called me the action president although I do also have style,\u201d Mr. Obama said as the crowd burst into laughter. \u201cAl\u2019s not the only guy with style.\u201d\n\nIn his passionate speech, Mr. Obama touted his accomplishments, including the Affordable Care Act, and addressed voting rights that, in his view, are under attack from Republicans.\n\n\u201cJust as inequality feeds on injustice, opportunity requires justice and justice requires the right to vote,\u201d Mr. Obama declared. \u201cIn the eyes of the law and the eyes of our democracy, we\u2019re all supposed to have that equal right to cast our ballot to help determine the direction of our society. The principle of one person, one vote is the single greatest tool we have to address an unjust status quo.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d think there\u2019d not be an argument about this anymore,\u201d Mr. Obama added. \u201cThe stark simple truth is this: the right to vote is threatened today in a way that it has not been since the Voting Rights Act became law nearly five decades ago. Across the country, Republicans have led efforts to pass laws making it harder, not easier for people to vote.\u201d\n\nThe president also threw some humor into the mix. After castigating those who would require official documentation at poll sites, Mr. Obama quipped, \u201cJust to be clear, I know where my birth certificate is.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou remember that?\u201d he added. \u201cThat was crazy. I hadn\u2019t thought about that in a while.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.byline_name": "Ross Barkan", "sailthru.author": "Ross Barkan", "application-name": "Observer", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/111787308.jpg?quality=80&w=640"}, "site": "@observer", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@Observer"}, "sailthru.article.image.header": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/111787308.jpg?quality=80&w=728&h=418&crop=1", "sailthru.tags": "Al Sharpton, Barack Obama, National Action Network, obsPolitics", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/111787308.jpg?quality=80&w=50", "keywords": "rev. al sharpton, barack obama, national action network, fbi informant, rat, wearing a wire, spy on mob", "sailthru.article.image.grid": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/111787308.jpg?quality=80&w=300&h=225&crop=1", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://observer.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/dac0f3722a48a53be75eb06c0c4f5119?s=16", "description": "President Barack Obama praised Rev.
