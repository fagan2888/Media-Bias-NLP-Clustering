Cory Booker\u2019s staff assured leaders of the Jewish Federation of Greater MetroWest that Booker shared the Jewish community\u2019s concerns over the social needs of the constituents both serve.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve focused on issues important to all New Jerseyans,\u201d said Mo Butler, the director of Booker\u2019s New Jersey offices. \u201cWe want to be perceived as \u2018the mayor of the state.\u2019\u201d\n\nButler and Booker\u2019s deputy state director, George Helmy, met representatives of the federation, its Community Relations Committee, the Jewish Family Service and Jewish Vocational Service of MetroWest, and the American Jewish Committee\u2019s Metro NJ Region on May 20 in the conference room of Gibbons PC, a Newark law firm.\n\nButler, chief of staff when Booker was mayor of Newark, now runs the Democratic senator\u2019s offices in Newark and Camden.\n\nHe detailed Booker\u2019s legislative efforts on behalf of immigrants, unemployment benefits, and aid to small businesses.\n\n\u201cWe are hyper-focused on hyper-local issues that impact everyday people through the state,\u201d Butler said. \u201cWe are trying to bring DC to Woodbridge or to Clifton or to Union City.\u201d\n\nMax Kleinman, executive vice president/CEO of the Jewish federation, explained that aging-in-place programs have been a prime concern to the Jewish community.\n\n\u201cNow, with Obamacare, where the federal government is picking up more and more of the cost of health insurance, it is even more important for us to come up with initiatives for the elderly, where they get supportive services\u201d from Jewish agencies, Kleinman said. \u201cIt would be a lot less expensive than Medicaid and nursing homes.\u201d\n\nCRC chair Gordon Haas also spoke about the naturally-occurring retirement communities, or NORCs, at the heart of aging-in-place initiatives, saying such programs reduce the high costs associated with nursing homes.\n\nNORCs \u201cwere always funded by earmarks,\u201d said Haas, referring to a practice, curtailed in 2010, that allowed members of Congress to specify funds to a particular project in their home jurisdiction. \u201cBut somebody has got to find a way to re-establish the earmarks,\u201d Haas urged.\n\nReuben Rotman, executive director of Jewish Family Service of MetroWest, also spoke to the need for government funding for its range of social services.\n\n\u201cWe have been fortunate that we can get a little private foundation grant here, a little there,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can patch them together, but without the federal support our programs are hurting.\u201d\n\nKleinman said help for needy Holocaust survivors was \u201cespecially urgent, because in the next 10 years, very few of them will still be around.\u201d\n\nBack to top\n\nLeave a Comment\n\nBack to top", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Jewish News, NJJN, Israel, Israeli, Israel News, Jewish New Jersey, Jewish Newspaper,\nNew Jersey Newspaper, New Jersey News, Jewish Calendar, Middle East News, Jewish Dating, New Jersey Jewish News,\nJews, American Jewish News, NJ Jews, NJ Jewish News, New Jersey Jewish Community, Jewish Books, Jewish Federation,\nKosher Restaurants, Kosher Recipes, Jewish Customs, Jewish Travel, Greater MetroWest, MetroWest, Central NJ, Central New Jersey,\neditorials, editors column, commentary, Princeton, Mercer County, Monmouth County, Somerset County, Middlesex County", "og": {"image": "http://njjewishnews.com/images/uploads/150thumbs/CRCKleinmanCOM150.jpg", "site_name": "New Jersey Jewish News | NJJN", "title": "Booker\u2019s staff meets with Jewish leaders"}, "description": "A senior member of Sen.
