The sweet golden liquid from the beehive is a popular kitchen staple loaded with antibacterial and antifungal properties that has been used since the early days of Egyptian tombs.\n\nHoney\u2019s scientific super powers contribute to its vastly touted health benefits for the whole body. The healthy natural sweetener offers many nutritional benefits depending on its variety. Raw honey is the unpasteurized version of commonly used honey and only differs in its filtration, which helps extend its shelf life. A tablespoon of raw honey contains 64 calories, is fat-free, cholesterol-free, and sodium-free, says the National Honey Board. Its composition is roughly 80 percent carbohydrates, 18 percent water, and two percent vitamins, minerals, and amino acids.\n\nTypically, honey is sweet but can be cruel to infants. Spores of Clostridium botulinum bacteria \u2014 found in dirt and dust, which can contaminate honey \u2014 may lead to infant botulism and produce a toxin inside the body that can cause muscle weakness and breathing problems. The Mayo Clinic recommends waiting until after 12 months of age to give infants honey; consumption is safe for older adults and kids, since they have a mature digestive system that can handle the spores.\n\nConsume honey responsibly and reap the numerous health benefits of this liquid gold.\n\n1. Alleviates Allergies\n\nHoney\u2019s anti-inflammatory effects and ability to soothe coughs has led to the belief it can also reduce seasonal allergy symptoms. Although there are no clinical studies proving its efficacy, Dr. Matthew Brennecke, a board certified naturopathic doctor practicing at the Rocky Mountain Wellness Center in Fort Collins, Colo., told Medical Daily in an email, \"A common theory is that honey acts like a natural vaccine.\" It contains small amounts of pollen, which if the body is exposed to small amounts of it, it can trigger an immune response that produces antibodies to the pollen. \"After repeated exposure, you should build up these antibodies and the body should become accustomed to their presence so that less histamine is released, resulting in a lesser allergic response.\"\n\n2. All-Natural Energy Drink\n\nHoney is an excellent source of all-natural energy at just 17 grams of carbohydrates per tablespoon. This natural unprocessed sugar \u2014 fructose and glucose \u2014 directly enter the bloodstream and can deliver a quick boost of energy. The rise in blood sugar acts as a short-term energy source for your workout, especially in longer endurance exercises.\n\nBrennecke said there is a con to adding honey to your workout. \u201cIf your goal in exercising is to increase muscle mass, working out on an empty stomach first thing in the morning is the way to go. When your body is in starvation mode (upon waking in morning), and you start exercising, you release insulin-like growthfactor-1 (IGF-1), which will help you build bulk,\u201d he said. Brennecke does warn this only works when blood sugars are low.\n\n3. Boosts Memory\n\nThe sweet nectar is loaded in antioxidants that may help prevent cellular damage and loss within the brain. A 2011 study published in Menopause found a daily spoonful of Malaysian honey may boost postmenopausal women\u2019s memory, which can provide an alternative therapy for the hormone-related intellectual decline. After four months of taking 20 grams of honey a day, the women were more likely to have better short-term memory than their counterparts who took hormone pills.\n\nHoney\u2019s ability to help the body absorb calcium, according to Brennecke, helps aid brain health. The brain needs calcium in order to process thought and make decisions. \u201cAs our populations continue to get older and older, the likelihood of dementia setting in because of poor intake of vitamins and minerals continues to get higher and higher,\u201d he said.\n\n4. Cough Suppressant\n\nHoney can be the all-natural cure when it comes to pesky colds. A persistent cough that won\u2019t go away can easily be remedied with two teaspoons of honey, according to a 2012 study published in the journal Pediatrics. Children between the ages of 1 and 5 with nighttime cough due to colds coughed less frequently when they received two teaspoons of honey 30 minutes before bed.\n\nThe golden liquid\u2019s thick consistency helps coat the throat while the sweet taste is believed to trigger nerve endings that protect the throat from incessant coughing. Honey is believed to be as effective as the common cough suppressant ingredient dextromethorphan. It can be used in treating upper respiratory tract infections.\n\n5. Sleep Aid\n\nHoney can be a health aid for sleepless nights. Similar to sugar, honey can cause a rise in insulin and release serotonin \u2014 a neurotransmitter that improves mood and happiness. \u201cThe body converts serotonin into melatonin, a chemical compound that regulates the length and the quality of sleep,\u201d Rene Ficek, registered dietitian and lead dietitian nutritionist at Seattle Sutton's Healthy Eating in Chicago, Ill., told Medical Daily in an email.\n\nMoreover, honey also contains several amino acids, including tryptophan that is commonly associated with turkey. Honey\u2019s steady rise in insulin, according to Brennecke, causes the tryptophan in honey to enter the brain, where it\u2019s then converted into serotonin and then into melatonin, which is a sleep aid. This hormone is responsible for regulating sleep and wake cycles.\n\n6. Treats Dandruff\n\nHoney can bring temporary relief to the scalp by targeting dandruff. A 2001 study published in the European Journal of Medical Research found applying honey diluted with 10 percent warm water to problem areas and leaving it on for three hours before rinsing led to itch relief and no scaling within a week. Skin lesions healed within two weeks and patients even showed an improvement in hair loss. The patients did not relapse even after six months of use.\n\nThanks to honey's antibacterial and antifungal properties, it can also treat seborrheic dermatitis and dandruff, which are often caused by an overgrowth of fungus. Moreover, \u201choney also has anti-inflammatory properties, which address the redness and itching on the scalp,\u201d Brennecke said.\n\n7. Treats Wounds And Burns\n\nHoney is a natural antibiotic that can act both internally and externally. It can be used as a conventional treatment for wounds and burns by disinfecting wounds and sores from major species of bacteria such as methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). A 2005 study published in the British Journal of Surgery found all but one of patients who suffered from wounds and leg ulcers showed remarkable improvement after applying a topical application of honey.\n\nDr. Diane Radford, a breast surgical oncologist in St. Louis, Mo., told Medical Daily in an email, Manuka honey has antibacterial properties for wound healing. \u201cThe precursor for the active antibacterial agent methylglyoxal (MGO) comes from the nectar of m\u0101nuka trees. A specialized research unit at the University of Waikato is looking into the conversion to the active product,\u201d she said.\n\nHoney has been utilized for its medicinal properties for over 2,000 years and continues its legacy as a multipurpose health aid.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "health benefits of honey, heal your whole body, liquid gold", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Naturally heal your body back to health with the benefits of honey, from treating a pesky cold to itchy dandruff.", "title": "7 Healthy Uses For Honey", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/liquid-gold-7-health-benefits-honey-could-heal-your-whole-body-325932", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/03/16/honey-background-wooden-dipper.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Naturally heal your body back to health with the benefits of honey, from treating a pesky cold to itchy dandruff.", "title": "7 Healthy Uses For Honey", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/liquid-gold-7-health-benefits-honey-could-heal-your-whole-body-325932", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/03/16/honey-background-wooden-dipper.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/03/16/honey-background-wooden-dipper.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Vitality", "published_time": "2015-03-17T09:00:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-17T11:21:32-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Naturally heal your body back to health with the benefits of honey, from treating a pesky cold to itchy dandruff."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1584\"", "article_summary": "Raw honey is the unpasteurized version of commonly used honey and only differs in its filtration, which helps extend its shelf life.\nHoney\u2019s scientific super powers contribute to its vastly touted health benefits for the whole body.\nConsume honey responsibly and reap the numerous health benefits of this liquid gold.\nHoney has been utilized for its medicinal properties for over 2,000 years and continues its legacy as a multipurpose health aid.\nA tablespoon of raw honey contains 64 calories, is fat-free, cholesterol-free, and sodium-free, says the National Honey Board."}
