Facebook says they\u2019re places where fans of Congressman Cory Gardner and Democrat Mark Udall like to shop, respectively.\n\nFacebook had a little fun analyzing data from users who \u201clike\u201d Udall and Gardner, embroiled in a hot race for the U.S. Senate. It also looked at data based on \u201clikes\u201d for Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper and his GOP challenger, Bob Beauprez.\n\nFacebook, the social media giant, provided the information to \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d which is looking at critical swing states, including Colorado. One section analyzed the issues that were important to users, another looked at where Coloradans like to eat or shop, based on their likes.\n\nMercury Cafe in Denver was the No. 1 restaurant liked by Udall supporters. Farm House Market in Yuma was the No. 1 liked by Gardner supporters. Three of the top Gardner restaurants were in Yuma County. In case you\u2019re wondering whether the Eastern Plains locale is some sort of culinary oasis, Gardner happens to hail from Yuma.\n\nThe top issues for users who liked Hickenlooper were economic equality and mobility. The top issues for users who liked Beauprez were foreign policy and international relations.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at the entire survey, and here are some of the finds:\n\nRestaurants\n\nTop restaurants disproportionately liked by Udall supporters:\n\n1.
