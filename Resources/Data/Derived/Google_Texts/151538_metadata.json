Rand Paul (R-KY), a 2016 GOP presidential candidate, slammed former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush\u2014a likely 2016 candidate who hasn\u2019t announced yet that he\u2019s running\u2014for agreeing with President Barack Obama on the National Security Agency (NSA) data collection program. The program was ruled illegal by a federal appeals court on Thursday, prompting a likely Supreme Court battle soon\u2014something Paul expects to win.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\n\u201cWell I think I\u2019m the only Republican or Democrat candidate for the presidency who has said that I would end the bulk collection of records on day one,\u201d Paul said in his interview with Breitbart News on Thursday.\n\nIt was started by executive order and I would do it by executive order. The thing that\u2019s been disingenuous by the president is his privacy committee says he should end it, and he says \u201cokay, I\u2019ll end it when Congress does it.\u201d Well, it was started by executive order\u2014it can be ended by executive order. I\u2019m the only presidential candidate who has said that I would do this. There are in fact some that are completely the opposite. Jeb Bush has said that he\u2019s basically so much in love with the program that he\u2019s complimenting the president and saying this is the best thing President Obama ever did. So if Jeb Bush and President Obama are in complete agreement on this, I think it\u2019s important that maybe we talk about a Republican candidate who would be opposed to President Obama on this.\n\nBack in February in a foreign policy speech in Chicago, Jeb Bush sided with Obama in favor of the NSA data collection program.\n\n\u201cThat [fighting against terrorism] requires responsible intelligence-gathering and analysis, including the NSA metadata program, which contributes to awareness of potential terrorist cells and interdiction efforts on a global scale,\u201d Bush said then. \u201cFor the life of me, I don\u2019t understand [how] the debate has gotten off track, where we\u2019re not understanding and protecting\u2014we do protect our civil liberties, but this is a hugely important program to use these technologies to keep us safe.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s since many times further backed up Obama\u2019s data collection program.\n\n\u201cI would say the best part of the Obama administration would be his continuance of the protections of the homeland using, you know, the big metadata programs, the NSA being enhanced,\u201d Bush said in mid-April while appearing on Michael Medved\u2019s radio program. \u201cEven though he never defends it, even though he never openly admits it, there has been a continuation of a very important service, which is the first obligation I think of our national government is to keep us safe.\u201d\n\nIn March, Bush also appeared on Hugh Hewitt\u2019s radio program to say that he was \u201cnervous\u201d about criticism of the NSA program\u2014and he argued that it is essential to national security and fighting things like \u201clone wolf terrorism.\u201d\n\nSuch types of terrorism, Bush said there, \u201cis a serious threat in a world where we\u2019re so connected with the rest of the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have people moving in and people moving out,\u201d Bush said.\n\nPeople get their information now, not everybody gets to listen to your show to get all their information. People get their information in different ways. They get disaffected, disillusioned, preyed upon, and so yeah, I think that this is an ongoing threat, and I hope that our counterintelligence capabilities are always vigilant. I\u2019ve always been nervous about the attacks on the NSA, and somehow that we\u2019re losing our freedoms by keeping the homeland safe. I think we need to be really vigilant about that.\n\nBut Paul, in his interview on Thursday with Breitbart News, replied flatly \u201cno\u201d when asked if getting federal agents to get a warrant for those they\u2019re seeking information on would jeopardize national security.\n\n\u201cI think you\u2019re protecting liberty, you\u2019re protecting the bill of rights, and the thing is is that if there\u2019s any kind of problem with the warrant process I\u2019d be for reforming that,\u201d Paul said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Exclusive \u2014 Rand Paul Slams Jeb Bush For Agreeing With Obama\u2019s NSA Data Collection", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Exclusive \u2014 Rand Paul Slams Jeb Bush For Agreeing With Obama\u2019s NSA Data Collection", "title": "Exclusive \u2014 Rand Paul Slams Jeb Bush For Agreeing With Obama\u2019s NSA Data Collection - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/AP705894992751.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/05/07/exclusive-rand-paul-slams-jeb-bush-for-agreeing-with-obamas-nsa-data-collection/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Exclusive \u2014 Rand Paul Slams Jeb Bush For Agreeing With Obama\u2019s NSA Data Collection", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/AP705894992751.jpg", "title": "Exclusive \u2014 Rand Paul Slams Jeb Bush For Agreeing With Obama\u2019s NSA Data Collection - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "data collection, domestic surveillance, Jeb Bush, NSA, NSA Spying, President Barack Obama, Rand Paul,2016 Presidential Race, Big Government,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "Rand Paul", "published_time": "2015-05-07T10:38:30-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "Back in February in a foreign policy speech in Chicago, Jeb Bush sided with Obama in favor of the NSA data collection program.\nJeb Bush\u2014a likely 2016 candidate who hasn\u2019t announced yet that he\u2019s running\u2014for agreeing with President Barack Obama on the National Security Agency (NSA) data collection program.\nJeb Bush has said that he\u2019s basically so much in love with the program that he\u2019s complimenting the president and saying this is the best thing President Obama ever did.\nSo if Jeb Bush and President Obama are in complete agreement on this, I think it\u2019s important that maybe we talk about a Republican candidate who would be opposed to President Obama on this.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERSen.
