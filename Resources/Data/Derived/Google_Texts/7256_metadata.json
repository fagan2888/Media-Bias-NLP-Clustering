Gen. Saad Maan, told Iraqi state television that the U.S.-led coalition was supporting Iraqi troops with \u201cpainful\u201d airstrikes since late Friday.\n\nIbrahim didn\u2019t give details on the ongoing battles, but described the situation on the ground as \u201cpositive\u201d and vowed that the Islamic State group would be pushed out of the city \u201cin the coming hours.\u201d\n\nSEE ALSO: Islamic State takeover in Ramadi will be \u2018costly\u2019 for terrorist group, U.S. warns\n\nOn Friday, the militants swept through Ramadi, capital of the western Anbar province, launching a coordinated offensive included three near-simultaneous suicide car bombings. The militants seized the main government headquarters and other key parts of the city.\n\nLocal officials said dozens of security forces and civilians were killed, mainly the families of the troops. Ten police officers and 30 pro-government tribal fighters were among those killed.\n\nU.S. Vice President Joe Biden spoke with Iraqi Prime Minister Haider Al-Abadi on Friday, promising the delivery of heavy weapons, including AT-4 shoulder-held rockets to counter suicide car bombs, according to a U.S. Embassy statement.\n\nThe statement said both leaders agreed on the \u201cimportance and urgency of mobilizing tribal fighters working in coordination with Iraqi security forces to counter ISIL and to ensure unity of effort among all of Iraq\u2019s communities.\u201d It used an alternative acronym for the IS group.\n\nBacked by U.S.-led airstrikes, Iraqi forces and Kurdish fighters have made gains against the IS group, including capturing the northern city of Tikrit. But progress has been slow in Anbar, a vast Sunni province where anger at the Shiite-led government runs deep and where U.S. forces struggled for years to beat back a potent insurgency. American soldiers fought some of their bloodiest battles since Vietnam on the streets of Fallujah and Ramadi.\n\nElsewhere in Iraq on Saturday, police said gunmen stormed an apartment in downtown Baghdad, killing three men and two women suspected of prostitution. Previous attacks on suspected prostitutes have been blamed on extremists from the Sunni and Shiite communities.\n\nIn Baghdad\u2019s southern Dora district, a roadside bomb struck an army patrol, killing two soldiers and wounding three others. A sticky bomb attached to a minibus exploded and killed two passengers in eastern Baghdad.\n\nPolice said a bomb exploded on a commercial street in the town of Mahmoudiya, just south of Baghdad, killing two people and wounding nine others.\n\nMedical officials confirmed the casualties from all attacks.
