Tell me how to get to \u2018yes.\u2019 Work with me. C\u2019mon. Don\u2019t just say \u2018no.\u2019 You can\u2019t just say \u2018no.\u2019\u201d\n\nRepublican leaders say they oppose Mr. Obama\u2019s plan to raise about $320 billion over 10 years by raising capital-gains taxes and closing tax loopholes primarily used by wealthier families and corporations.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, California Republican, noted Wednesday that the House approved an infrastructure bill to streamline permitting for natural-gas pipelines, a measure that the president opposes.\n\n\u201cHe has already threatened to veto this bill that would help deliver affordable energy across America,\u201d Mr. McCarthy said, calling the legislation a \u201cstrong and straightforward bill [that] improves energy infrastructure, meaning lower energy costs and more jobs.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith bipartisan legislation like this, the president should set his sights higher than the veto pen,\u201d he said\n\nCory Fritz, an aide to Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio, said Mr. Obama \u201cjust isn\u2019t living in reality.\u201d\n\n\u201cRepublicans are saying \u2018yes\u2019 to good, common-sense jobs bills, and they\u2019ll soon be sitting on the president\u2019s desk,\u201d Mr. Fritz said.\n\nMr. Obama\u2019s appearance at Boise State drew a crowd of about 6,600, which cheered his proposals for government-paid tuition and expanded tax credits for college students.\n\nThe president also poked fun at Republican lawmakers for what he said was their antagonistic behavior as he outlined his spending proposals during the State of the Union address.\n\n\u201cSome of you may have noticed that Republicans were not applauding for many of these ideas,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cThey were kind of quiet. I know there are Republicans who disagree with my approach. I could see that from their body language.\u201d\n\nHe said their battle is often over how to pay for various proposals. And the president said ending tax breaks for the wealthy is the fairest solution.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got the super-rich getting giveaways they don\u2019t need and middle class families not getting the breaks that they do need,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cLet\u2019s have a tax code that truly helps working Americans, the vast majority of Americans, get a leg up in this new economy.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Obama ridiculed congressional Republicans on Wednesday as ignoring the needs of middle-class families and said the GOP should offer their own ideas to pay for his new spending proposals from his State of the Union address.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "President Obama ridiculed congressional Republicans on Wednesday as ignoring the needs of middle-class families and said the GOP should offer their own ideas to pay for his new spending proposals from his State of the Union address.", "title": "Obama accuses GOP of not wanting to help middle-class families", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jan/21/obama-accuses-gop-not-wanting-help-middle-class-fa/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/21/obama-idahojpeg-0f4ae.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/21/obama-idahojpeg-0f4ae.jpg", "description": "President Obama ridiculed congressional Republicans on Wednesday as ignoring the needs of middle-class families and said the GOP should offer their own ideas to pay for his new spending proposals from", "card": "summary", "title": "Obama accuses GOP of not wanting to help middle-class families"}, "Author": "Dave Boyer", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Business Finance, Social Issues, Education, Politics, Boise State University"}, "article_summary": "\u201cYou can\u2019t pretend there\u2019s nothing we can do to help middle-class families get ahead,\u201d Mr. Obama said of Republicans.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got the super-rich getting giveaways they don\u2019t need and middle class families not getting the breaks that they do need,\u201d Mr. Obama said.\n\u201cSome of you may have noticed that Republicans were not applauding for many of these ideas,\u201d Mr. Obama said.\nPresident Obama ridiculed congressional Republicans on Wednesday as ignoring the needs of middle-class families and said the GOP should offer their own ideas to pay for his new spending proposals from his State of the Union address.\nI could see that from their body language.\u201dHe said their battle is often over how to pay for various proposals."}
