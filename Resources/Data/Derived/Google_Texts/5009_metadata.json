A linguist and literary critic prominent in the last century added to the thought by insisting that context is more important than text. The meaning of what one says, in other words, is relational: It can be understood only by way of when, how, to whom and even where one says it.\n\nThere is no escaping the thought of words as actions as it applies to foreign policy. Washington has its \u201cmoderate opposition\u201d in Syria, and the designation is an essential tool of U.S. strategy, even as these moderates include a consequential, maybe decisive, number of radical Islamist factions. It is almost frightening to carry this thought anywhere near Russia and the Ukraine crisis, where all that Russian \u201caggression\u201d right out of the clear blue, no reason at all for it, now has Defense Secretary Carter sending NATO weaponry and rotating troops a matter of miles from the Russian border.\n\nWords as actions fly thick as mosquitoes in spring these days. Some of those I have in mind came from President Obama during his remarkable but problematic trip to Havana last week. Others came from Castro \u2014 Fidel, I mean \u2014 in reply to Obama\u2019s.\n\nThen there are Donald Trump\u2019s words in those lengthy interviews on foreign policy he just gave the New York Times and the Washington Post. The transcripts are here and here. The Don \u2014 better than \u201cthe Donald,\u201d somehow \u2014 seems to have wowed the policy cliques and the media clerks: They have since had many words of their own.\n\nWe have heard the words these past 10 days but now must look at them as actions, I urge. We need to see what is being done by way of what these people are saying, where, to whom and so on. Syria, Ukraine, all the Putin-bashing: It is easy to see the intended point (even if a surprising number of us are taken in). The media\u2019s purposeful perversion of the truth is perfectly plain. But these other cases also deserve our attention; the points being made are subtler but not less important.\n\nWe live in a modern-day imperial power in the last throes of its aggressions. This is my read of our moment in a single sentence. The expansion phase is over, as the Russians, Chinese and others are in the process of telling us. The aggressions are not, surely, but it grows more difficult to aggress, and when we do it is defensive in character now, if this is not too much a paradox. It is all about denying where we are in history, and this is mostly what we hear and see when we consider our words as actions.\n\n*\n\nAnyone who accomplished what Obama has in our relations with Cuba would have been as eager as he to travel to Havana, the first American president in nearly a century to cross the Straits of Florida. The opening is an achievement, and may we make good on it by lifting the trade embargo. You would have thought Obama understood something of the complexity, even delicacy, involved when an American leader sets foot on Cuban soil and speaks. But he seems not to have grasped this, or the predicament he was stepping into.\n\nI do not rate Obama\u2019s speech at El Gran Teatro de Havana on March 22 anything like a complete failure. But it was not a success either, as the elder Castro made plain in his much-noted essay in Granma, the official newspaper, after Obama\u2019s departure. What was Obama trying to get done when he addressed \u201cthe Cuban people\u201d \u2014 if, indeed, they were his primary audience?\n\nObama sounded some very good notes. I rank his stress on a shared identity high among these. \u201cWe both live in a New World, colonized by Europeans,\u201d he said as he got under way. \u201cCuba, like the United States, was built in part by slaves brought from Africa.\u201d\n\nThen to the nature of the Cuban-American relationship. \u201cI believe my visit here demonstrates that you do not need to fear a threat from the United States,\u201d he said when he first touched on this topic. It is a spectacle, truly, when an American president is called upon to assure another nation we will not invade it, but given the history it had to be said. And later: \u201cWe are in a new era.\u201d And later still: \u201cIt is time now for us to leave the past behind. It is time for us to look forward to the future together.\u201d\n\nOne could not ask for more in these assertions, so far as they went. But in between them our president said many very unwise things. No amount of sweetened coating obscures the blunt, discourteous lecture Obama delivered to the Castro government in the guise of his well-wishing address to its citizens. \u201cEven if we lift the embargo tomorrow,\u201d he said as he hit stride, \u201cCubans would not realize their potential without continued change here in Cuba.\u201d His next sentence tells you all you need to know about where Obama was headed: \u201cIt should be easier to open a business in Cuba.\u201d\n\nFrom there Obama was off and running. He praised the Internet, innovation, \u201centrepreneurship\u201d and open markets, our 21st-century objects of idolatry. He leveled cleverly indirect but otherwise unsubtle insults as to liberty and equality under law in Cuba. Then a couple of doozies: \u201cEvery child deserves the dignity that comes with education, health care and food on the table, and a roof over their heads.\u201d And later: \u201cAnd I believe voters should be able to choose their governments in free and democratic elections.\u201d\n\nOne can scarcely believe the nerve, given Cuba\u2019s famously superior record in several of these categories. As to liberty, absent in Obama\u2019s remarks, per usual when American leaders interact with others, is any grasp of causality. No revolution can be judged fairly without reference to its counterrevolution, as I have argued previously. And Cuba\u2019s survival after nearly six decades\u2019 worth of attempted subversion is an accomplishment with costs most Cubans understand and pay without more than the everyday variety of complaint. On the subject of elections, in our splendid political season, I will simply let Obama\u2019s remark sit without comment among my fellow Americans.\n\nWhat was Obama doing in this speech \u2014 what is the action buried in the words? A few things, in my read. The Havana visit being Obama\u2019s punctuation mark, we should understand these things if we are to judge just what the president accomplished with the opening to Cuba.\n\nOne, Obama\u2019s all-but-stated mission is perfectly congruent with the American mission the world over and varies only in method from the strategy in Cuba since the Castro revolution: It is to cultivate a neoliberal economic order conducive to foreign corporate investment. No second Bay of Pigs, no more exploding cigars for Fidel, no more covert counterintelligence operations \u2014 this last we must count a maybe at this point. But the campaign continues by other means, as it does elsewhere. One of these means is words.\n\nTwo, Obama was attempting to transport to another country and people the peculiar bubble of unreality within which Americans now live. No president or secretary of state can escape this ideological imperative. A couple of examples will do.\n\nPresident Obama is surely smart enough to recognize that Cubans have a different idea of what constitutes liberty and freedom. They are as individual as anyone else \u2014 Obama\u2019s offensive suggestion to the contrary notwithstanding. But like most people other than Americans and members of the British Conservative Party, Cubans understand that the individual achieves his or her fullest potential only when the social self is conscious and activated. Obama could go nowhere near this simple thought. When Obama spoke, he gave Cubans a demonstration of our ideological confinement. The take-home: We may never have a serious conversations with the Cubans, given we simply cannot speak to others in any idiom other than our own.\n\nThe other example concerns remembering and forgetting. No Cuban forgets all that Americans did in our shared history. Read the speech. Consider Fidel\u2019s anger on hearing it. Obama glossed every mention of the decades of ill America has done and the suffering this ill has caused so many Cubans. \u201cOur governments became adversaries,\u201d he said at one point. Deceptive syntax gets no cleverer: Hardly is that what happened. But it is typical of Obama\u2019s language while in Havana. Four words cannot erase six decades of purposely destructive policy, but that is the action in Obama\u2019s words.\n\nThird and final point. Obama did not apologize for any of the past, as anyone who reads the speech will notice. This is because of his intended audience. I noted earlier that while pretending to address the Cuban people, he was talking to the Castro government. True, but not the whole story. At the very bottom of the well, Obama was addressing us, we Americans.\n\nLiberty, health care, education, racial equality, equality under law. His mention of these things in Havana reminds me of Hillary Clinton\u2019s supposedly dazzling assertion in Beijing a few years ago: \u201cWomen\u2019s rights are human rights.\u201d That remark had nothing to do with China \u2014 where women\u2019s exceptional advances since 1949 are universally acknowledged \u2014 and would have no impact on China. Clinton was speaking to women voters back here, as the history Clinton\u2019s comment has since accumulated should make plain.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Forget his impractical foreign policy solutions.
