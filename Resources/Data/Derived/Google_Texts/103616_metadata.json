Thanks to changes in the law that have been in the works since 2008, the behavioral health sector will be on more equal footing with general medical care. That means millions more Americans will soon be able to seek treatment for mental health and substance abuse.\n\nAs the owner of the Renfrew Center, established in 1985, Sam Menaged could teach a class on ways to persuade insurers to cover patients. But even with all his savvy, Menaged still loses plenty of business.\n\n\u201cRenfrew turns away at least 40 percent of those patients who are referred to us because it\u2019s prohibited under their policies,\u201d he says.\n\nBut Menaged thinks the denial days may be ending.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m already investigating other cities to open in, lower levels of care, but also residential care,\" he says.\n\nIf you are in the behavioral health business, 2014 is a defining moment. First, you\u2019ve got the Affordable Care Act, which opens up service to all the uninsured. The law also requires most plans to include mental health and substance abuse services. The University of Maryland\u2019s Howard Goldman says out-of-pocket spending \u2013 deductibles and co-pays \u2013 is on par with what a patient would spend on general medical care.\n\n\u201cIt means that millions more people will be able to seek services in the private sector and have those services covered -- and covered in a way that will not cause them to be bankrupted,\u201d he says.\n\nMore patients with better access to care have providers and investors humming. One in four Americans has a diagnosable mental disorder, including individuals with addiction. About 40 million people are expected to get improved access to mental health and substance abuse services by 2016.\n\nWith a market like that, it\u2019s no wonder Wall Street has started sniffing around says Mark Covall, President of the National Association of Psychiatric Health Systems.\n\n\u201cThere [are] huge investments in healthcare. And mental health has been on the sidelines. Today we are seeing investors look at this part of healthcare very differently,\u201d he says.\n\nCovall expects providers to plough new money back into their businesses and find ways to make services more affordable and attractive for insurers.\n\nThese new financial opportunities also represent behavioral health\u2019s coming out party.\n\nNYU Dean Sherry Glied says that makes \"therapy\" and \"addiction\" less like dirty words.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve deinstitutionalized in some sense stigma. We\u2019ve taken it out of our insurance institutions. Whether we can take it out of our social institutions remains to be seen, but it\u2019s definitely a big step forward,\u201d she says.\n\nGlied says finally, mental health is just another condition. And there\u2019s room to make money off it, just like every other health condition.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-square310x310logo": "/assets/mstile-310x310-9380546aaae2d32ed4a1460d4ffac0ddd0197d240c08a97d9ba80e663f2f42e2.png", "application-name": "Marketplace from APM", "og": {"url": "http://www.marketplace.org/2014/06/27/health-care/mental-health-parity-opens-new-business-opportunities", "image": "http://cms.marketplace.org/sites/default/files/styles/primary-image-900x500/public/81821408.jpg?itok=5bubzw5D", "type": "article", "description": "New rules mean it will be easier for millions to get mental health treatment.", "title": "Mental health parity opens new business opportunities"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Marketplace"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFF", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/assets/mstile-70x70-797ef1ac7d8ffe040b98bab7140abf109b307280019c7d5c16c614ac6f66319d.png", "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/assets/mstile-310x150-11f7c8519056bc96bf2540c4b2aa8564178ebcae2594d3e8fb28d480f2c5cd8a.png", "csrf-token": "eJcVntwMxHAID98srjh0urPmowrVryKkbx545tq+VloUv5KjiZ+DPky23grCi/+AjdJCDNCYq9aD+/+PVUXNug==", "msapplication-TileImage": "/assets/mstile-144x144-a9640051fbfb73c1de9771231343135b5f79295e3f98bb1cb87854aa6a74f8c8.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/assets/mstile-150x150-1d103d04b61aaa10bb165f225c46e694338b92918bc7a7ca2b99b54bdd1bbc0c.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe06bd\"", "article_summary": "That means millions more Americans will soon be able to seek treatment for mental health and substance abuse.\nAbout 40 million people are expected to get improved access to mental health and substance abuse services by 2016.\nThe law also requires most plans to include mental health and substance abuse services.\nIf you are in the behavioral health business, 2014 is a defining moment.\nGlied says finally, mental health is just another condition."}
