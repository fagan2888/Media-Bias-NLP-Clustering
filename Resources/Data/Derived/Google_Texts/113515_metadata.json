Last year, 11.2 percent of Mainers lacked health insurance, up from 10.2 percent in 2012.\n\nGoing without coverage puts Mainers\u2019 health at risk and threatens their economic security when high medical bills hit, said Emily Brostek of Consumers for Affordable Health Care, an Augusta-based advocacy group.\n\n\u201cWe know that people who don\u2019t have health insurance are more likely to have a number of negative health outcomes \u2026 There have been some recent studies that show a higher death rate even, ultimately, for people and communities with high uninsurance rates,\u201d she said.\n\nNew Jersey was the only other state to record an increase in its uninsured population, which ticked up by 47,000 people.\n\nWhile Maine\u2019s uninsured rate increased, it remained lower than rates in many other states. The national average was 14.5 percent, dipping by 0.2 percentage points.\n\nThe American Community Survey included a margin of error in Maine of 10,000 people. With a sample of 3 million households, it asks whether families are covered at the time of the survey.\n\nExperts noted that the results reflected little about the impact of the Affordable Care Act, which aims to bring health insurance to millions more Americans. The survey was administered prior to the law\u2019s broad expansion of health insurance coverage through private insurance marketplaces and largely before states began expanding their Medicaid programs under the ACA.\n\nPrivate health insurance policies available through Healthcare.gov and state-run insurance marketplaces took effect on Jan. 1 of this year.\n\nWhile Maine was one of 21 states that opted against expanding Medicaid, the health insurance program for the poor, the effect of that decision on uninsured rates won\u2019t play out until 2014 data is available next year, said Genevieve Kenney, co-director and senior fellow in health policy at the Urban Institute in Washington, D.C.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think this is being driven by state decisions with respect to the Medicaid expansion,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a question of timing.\u201d\n\nBut in addition to refusing to expand Medicaid, Maine Gov. Paul LePage and the 125th Maine Legislature, led by Republicans, also tightened eligibility criteria for the program in 2011 and 2012. Those changes prevented many low-income adults from qualifying or keeping their coverage.\n\nEnrollment in the program, known as MaineCare, fell by nearly 15,000 people from December 2012 to December 2013, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. That could prove a significant factor in Maine\u2019s higher uninsured rate, Kenney said.\n\nOther possible reasons include the economic recession, which may have prompted employers to drop or limit expensive health insurance benefits, she said. Most Mainers get health coverage through their jobs.\n\nThe share of Mainers with private health insurance \u2014 either accessed through work or purchased on their own \u2014 fell 6 percent from 2012 to 2013, according to the state insurance bureau.\n\nPrivate health insurance also grew more expensive in Maine over many of the last few years, though premium costs for new Affordable Care Act plans are significantly lower.\n\nA separate Census report released Thursday, the Current Population Survey, found that the nation\u2019s uninsured rate was 13.4 percent in 2013, or about 42 million people. That survey asked 10,000 households if they were uninsured for the entire previous year.\n\nBecause it reflects the year leading up to the ACA\u2019s coverage expansion, that survey similarly sheds little light on the impact of the law, health policy experts said.\n\nAdditionally, the Census announced earlier this year a change to how it asks households about their health insurance coverage in the survey, in order to more accurately gauge coverage. That makes comparing rates from 2012 to 2013 unreliable, but Census officials said the data provides a good baseline of the country\u2019s health insurance landscape prior to the law\u2019s implementation.\n\nThe Census numbers came out on the same day as a third federal report, conducted by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, which marked the first federal survey of the nation\u2019s uninsured rate since the health insurance marketplaces opened to consumers. That survey found the country hit a new low in the number of American adults without coverage. In the first quarter of 2014, 18.4 percent of Americans lacked health insurance, down from 20.4 percent in 2013.\n\nYoung adults between 19 and 25 years old showed the biggest drop in uninsured rates, at 20.9 percent in early 2014 from 26.5 percent in 2013. The ACA allows parents to keep children on their insurance plans until age 26.\n\nThe survey, which sampled 27,627 people, reflected much of the open enrollment period for health exchange plans, which began in January. But it didn\u2019t account for a late rush of signups for plans that wouldn\u2019t have taken effect until April.\n\nDespite the flood of data released Tuesday, the ACA\u2019s impact on the uninsured hasn\u2019t come into clear focus just yet, according to Brostek.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ll see the full picture as we get more time and get more data that covers all of 2014,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The share of Mainers without health insurance rose from 2012 to 2013, making the state one of just two nationally to record an increase, according to new U.S. Census data.
