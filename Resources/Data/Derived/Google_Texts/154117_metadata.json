A virtual industry of books (Paleo Slow Cooker), magazines (Paleo), and blogs, podcasts, and retreats (Everyday Paleo) have been popularising the idea that eating what cavemen ate \u2014 lots of meat, fish, and plants; no grains, sugar, and dairy products \u2014 is the path to weight loss and better health.\n\nWhile the \u201cresearch\u201d behind these recommendations is subject to considerable dispute, the one thing we do know for sure is that most cavemen died by age 25. It\u2019s true that high infant mortality was a dramatic contributor to this pattern, but the fact remains that few made it anywhere close to the modern day life expectancy of 75 to 80 in western countries.\n\nSo, do we really want to eat like people who died when most of us are just finishing the first third of our lives nowadays?\n\nThe disconnect between recommendations and results is striking. But it\u2019s not all that uncommon, be it about a diet or about business. In a world seemingly overrun with data, analysis, and experts, what people say we should do and what actually works can be like ships passing in the night.\n\nLimit your egg consumption to two or three per week to cut down on cholesterol? Turns out that \u201cexpert\u201d advice was wrong, and eggs are a particularly nutritious and healthy way to start your day, with little impact on blood cholesterol levels.\n\nCut back on saturated fats and salt? Turns out even this holy grail of health has also been found wanting.\n\nThere may be no better example of false assumptions driving mistaken decision-making than the business of health care in the United States. Regions of the country that spend more on health care have more hospital beds and doctors, especially medical specialists. So, more spending is good, right?\n\nNot so fast. It turns out that physicians in higher spending regions actually report more communication problems among caregivers and with patients, as well as greater difficulty obtaining inpatient admissions. Even worse, the mortality rate following heart attacks, colorectal cancer diagnosis and hip fractures was actually higher in regions that spent more.\n\nWhy do people fall into this trap? For one thing, humans are lazy. They often seek a simple fix for a complex problem. After all, doesn\u2019t it seem easier to \u201ceat like a caveman\u201d than to carefully monitor their daily diet with what they have in the fridge already?\n\nBut for any fixes to be sustainable, we must seek hard evidence. Let\u2019s remember what we\u2019re really trying to accomplish and make sure that whatever we\u2019re buying into, it\u2019s going to help us get there. The Paleo diet sounds intriguing \u2014 and parts of it might even be right \u2014 but don\u2019t you think it makes sense to see how it actually did in practice? Not what we wish, or assume, it would do, but what it actually did.\n\nSame for health care spending. It sounds like a good idea to have more resources for health care, more hospital beds, more specialists. But it turns out that those things don\u2019t actually produce what we really care about \u2014 actual health care outcomes.\n\nFans of baseball will easily see the connection to Moneyball, the Michael Lewis book that introduced a wide audience to the huge discrepancies between accepted wisdom among baseball scouts and what the data actually said worked. For example, there is no such thing as how a baseball player should look \u2014 broad shoulders and a square jaw scored points with baseball scouts \u2014 but there are a bunch of specific performance-oriented metrics you can look for to indicate potential.\n\nManagement myths\n\nOf course the practice of management is replete with instances of precisely the same problem. Take interviews. Most managers swear by them, and can\u2019t imagine hiring someone who doesn\u2019t come out strong one-on-one. Sounds sensible, but did you know that traditional interviews are one of the worst ways to predict actual job performance?\n\nSavvy managers know to choreograph an interview so they can assess whether a candidate possesses the specific skills and experiences that are needed to succeed on the job.\n\nI\u2019m often asked to evaluate resumes, and my number one recommendation is to specify what you accomplished, and not what you spent time on. Focusing on outcomes provides would-be employers with the evidence they need about your fit for a job.\n\nIt would be nice if the focus on outcomes spread to other walks of life. Don\u2019t tell me that you\u2019ve increased the number of hospital beds; show me evidence that fewer people are dying after being treated at your hospital.\n\nWhile many health care providers will be kicking and screaming on the way to revealing their actual results, this trend is well underway in the US and will be accelerating as the Affordable Care Act (also known as Obamacare) takes root.
