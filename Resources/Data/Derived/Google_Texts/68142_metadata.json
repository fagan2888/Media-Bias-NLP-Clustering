There also was a renewed push to get rid of MNsure and move to the federal health insurance shopping site, a switch that would do nothing to rein in the forces driving up premiums here.\n\nDFLers didn\u2019t contribute much either. Gov. Mark Dayton unhelpfully issued a vague threat about insurance companies\u2019 role in health care. The party\u2019s lawmakers were mostly silent, with a few timidly offering up a silver lining \u2014 that the steep increases likely mean more Minnesotans will qualify for tax-credit assistance to buy insurance. More federal money chasing after skyrocketing premiums isn\u2019t comforting. And thousands of Minnesotans will still earn too much to qualify for this aid.\n\nHealth care consumers deserve far better. The increases are unacceptable, and it\u2019s time for a serious debate in this state about how to rein them in. Needed are policymakers willing to drill down into the mechanics of the individual market, which serves about 300,000 Minnesotans who don\u2019t get insurance through employers or public programs such as Medicare, and figure out why it is not working.\n\nHere\u2019s what has been missing from the premium hike debate: There are some Minnesota-specific conditions that may potentially undermine affordability in this small market segment. One is the fate of the state\u2019s former high-risk pool, which provided coverage \u2014 albeit costly \u2014 to those denied insurance because of pre-existing conditions.\n\nOnce the ACA\u2019s popular protections for pre-existing conditions kicked in, these consumers moved into the state\u2019s individual market, where their premiums often were much more affordable. The question before policymakers now hinges on the basic premise of insurance: spreading risk. Are there enough people in the state\u2019s individual market to spread out the expensive care needed by the former high-risk pool customers?\n\nThe question is even more critical because of Minnesota\u2019s decision, unique among states, to extend MinnesotaCare as a \u201cBasic Health Plan\u201d under the ACA. Many people who might be in the individual market are instead better served by the more affordable MinnesotaCare. But that further reduces the size of the individual market risk pool.\n\nThere certainly are other factors, such as prescription drug costs, driving premium increases. But it makes sense for the state\u2019s new health care task force, which is considering improvements to the ACA here, to focus on the individual market. A key question: Should the individual market be merged with the state\u2019s small-group market, which serves small businesses? That would double the size of the risk pool to about 600,000, potentially spreading high-cost care among more people.\n\nDepartment of Commerce Commissioner Mike Rothman has been a voice of reason in the premium debate. He sent a letter to the task force, urging it to prioritize individual market fixes and give careful consideration to merging the two markets. The small group\u2019s premiums leveled off for 2016. Insurers also don\u2019t appear to have lost money on this small-group market in recent years, suggesting that a merger could be beneficial.\n\nRothman and his agency need to become even more aggressive advocates for making the individual market work better, and lawmakers, Gov. Mark Dayton and the task force need to follow their lead. Cooperation and a willingness to delve into policymaking \u201cweeds\u201d is critical for future affordability.", "article_metadata": {"description": "State's focus should be on why individual market isn't working.", "og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "State's focus should be on why individual market isn't working.", "title": "Minnesota needs a smarter debate on causes of health premium hikes", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/minnesota-needs-a-smarter-debate-on-causes-of-health-premium-hikes/331835741/", "image": {"url": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_144443158233586.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "width": 1200, "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_144443158233586.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "State's focus should be on why individual market isn't working.", "title": "Minnesota needs a smarter debate on causes of health premium hikes", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/minnesota-needs-a-smarter-debate-on-causes-of-health-premium-hikes/331835741/", "image": {"src": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_144443158233586.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_144443158233586.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "article": {"tag": "health care task force"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "news_keywords": "health care costs,individual market,MinnesotaCare,MNsure,high-risk pool,premiums,Affordable Care Act,people,Gov.
