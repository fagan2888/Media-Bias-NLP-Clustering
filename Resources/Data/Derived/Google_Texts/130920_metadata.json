They write that Congressional Republicans have introduced a bill that would block states from regulating GM ingredients.\n\nMoving south to Massachusetts, Blue Mass Groups looks at how communities in Boston can say \u201cno\u201d to the siting of Olympics venues as the city puts together a bid to host the games in 2024.\n\nOn Saturday, Daily Kos reports on new statistics that show that 15 percent of arresting officers in the New York Police Department make 75 percent of all resisting arrest charges, charges that are often used to cover the excessive use of force by police. Staying in the Empire State, State of Politics reports that Democratic Governor Andrew Cuomo\u2019s office has said it is reviewing a proposal from the state\u2019s Attorney General for it to have the authority to investigate the deaths of unarmed civilians caused by police officers. These reform proposals come in the wake of a Staten Island Grand Jury\u2019s decision to not indict a police officer for his involvement in the death of Eric Garner, after the officer used a chokehold on the unarmed man.

They say that the case, which concerns on whether or not the plates\u2019 messages are vanity or government expressions, is now on hold.\n\nHeading south to the Sunshine state, SaintPetersblog writes on Friday that while Florida\u2019s economy appears to be doing well, it is not a sustainable one, with an increasing number of jobs coming from the leisure and hospitality sector. That sector has seen low wage rises out of pace with inflation, meaning that households will still be struggling to make ends meet.\n\nThis week, Left in Alabama criticizes a State Senator for claiming that news and opinion websites and bloggers may have more limited access to legislators in the next session, because they \u201care not real journalists\u201d.\n\nOn Sunday, National Review\u2019s The Campaign Spot reports that Bill Cassidy has defeated incumbent Senator Mary Landrieu with 55.9 percent of the vote to 44.1 percent in Saturday\u2019s election. They say that with Cassidy\u2019s win, the Republican Party now holds all statewide offices in Louisiana.\n\nIn the Lone Star State this week, Burnt Orange Report writes that the Attorney General, Greg Abbott, may block Dallas County from raising the local minimum wage to $10 an hour.

They say that state legislators have dropped the minimum wage scale for teachers and removed the requirements for schools to have a certain number of support personnel.\n\nMichigan\u2019s eclectablog reports this week on a bill from state Republicans that would strip the use of science out of any management of state lands as it pertains to diversity. They say that the bill, which is heading towards a House vote may open the way to greater corporate exploitation of natural resources.\n\nOn Friday, Political Heat looks at whether or not Wisconsin\u2019s 2011 law allowing for concealed carry has made the state safer. They say that following the law\u2019s implementation, violent crime increased, which shows that it has not made Wisconsin safer.\n\nOutside the Beltway reports this week that a group of protestors from Ferguson, Missouri, who were marching over the death by a police officer of Michael Brown in August, were met by counter protestors who displayed Confederate flags and racist symbols.\n\nSouth Dakota\u2019s Madville Time this week reports that the state has saved over $9 million thanks to the Affordable Care Act (ACA). They write that the ACA has rendered the state\u2019s high risk pool (which provided insurance to people that private insurers wouldn\u2019t cover) superfluous, and the program will be ended at the close of the fiscal year, leading to the savings.\n\nIn neighboring North Dakota this week, SayAnythingblog reports that tax collection rates have soared even as the state has cut its tax rates. They say that if Governor Jack Dalrymlpe\u2019s proposed further tax cuts go through, then income taxes will be nearly 50 percent lower than they were before 2009.\n\nWest and Pacific\n\nOn Wednesday this week, Colorado\u2019s The Spot looks at recently re-elected Governor John Hickenlooper\u2019s plans for his second inauguration in January.

They say that both candidates spent everything they had fighting a close campaign, and now need to fundraise further to pay staff and lawyers who are monitoring the recount. Staying in the Grand Canyon State, Blog for Arizona writes this week on the state Republican Party\u2019s \u2018culture of corruption\u2019. They say that Arizona\u2019s media tend to defend the rich and powerful elite that the GOP represent, and so gloss over corruption, such as when Governor-elect Doug Ducey appointed Kirk Adams as his chief of staff, despite Adams\u2019 dodgy record.\n\nHeading west to California, The Atlantic reports that high speed rail is now on course in the Golden State. They say that in a few weeks\u2019 time, recently re-elected Governor Jerry Brown will conduct a ground breaking ceremony on the first leg of the state\u2019s new high speed rail system, and that the winning bid for the next part of the line\u2019s construction has come in under budget estimates at $1.2 billion. Political Animal looks at whether or not there will be an open Senate seat in 2016, when Democrat Barbara Boxer\u2019s current term expires. They say if Boxer, who has held the seat since 1992, resigns, there are a number of younger Democrats, including Attorney General Kamala Harris, who may well step up.\n\nFeatured image credit: Ted McGrath (Flickr, CC-BY-NC-SA-2.0)\n\nPlease read our comments policy before commenting.\n\nNote: This article gives the views of the author, and not the position of USApp\u2013 American Politics and Policy, nor of the London School of Economics.\n\nShortened URL for this post: http://bit.ly/1A4eX4y", "article_metadata": {"description": "USApp Managing Editor,\u00a0Chris Gilson, looks at the week in U.S. state blogging.\u00a0Click here\u00a0for our weekly roundup of national blogs.
