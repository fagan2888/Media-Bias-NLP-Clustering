That's down from the premiere's 10.4 million -- but enough to lock in a win against NBC's Sochi coverage.\n\n\n\nThat's an advantage of nearly 30 percent, with The Walking Dead's 6.9 rating in the key demo topping the Olympics' 4.8 rating for the night.\n\n\n\nAmong total viewers, The Walking Dead pulled 13.3 million at 9 p.m. The Winter Games, with an average 21.3 million, again easily surpassed the series in viewership.\n\n\n\nThe Walking Dead had bigger competition in its second outing, facing both Sochi and the NBA All-Star Game. Post-show The Talking Dead averaged 4.8 million viewers and 3.1 million adults 18-49.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Michael O'Connell", "description": "Though the second episode of the AMC drama's midseason run dips, it still tops all TV for Sunday night among adults 18-49.", "og": {"site_name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "description": "Though the second episode of the AMC drama's midseason run dips, it still tops all TV for Sunday night among adults 18-49.", "title": "TV Ratings: 'Walking Dead' Tops Winter Olympics Again", "url": "http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/tv-ratings-walking-dead-tops-681114", "image": {"width": 1296, "identifier": "//cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2014/02/d975f268-c1f9-e138-b19c-835066fef7fc_twd_409_gp_0822_0221gn.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 730}, "type": "website"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-02-18 10:34:36", "sailthru.title": "TV Ratings: 'Walking Dead' Tops Winter Olympics Again", "fb": {"admins": 3111204}, "sailthru.vertical": "Live Feed", "sailthru.tags": "Live Feed, Television, TV Ratings", "sailthru.channel": "Live Feed", "sailthru.description": "Though the second episode of the AMC drama's midseason run dips, it still tops all TV for Sunday night among adults 18-49.", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce41c\"", "article_summary": "The Walking Dead maintained enough momentum on Sunday night to again to the Winter Olympics.\nPost-show The Talking Dead averaged 4.8 million viewers and 3.1 million adults 18-49.\nThe Walking Dead had bigger competition in its second outing, facing both Sochi and the NBA All-Star Game.\nAmong total viewers, The Walking Dead pulled 13.3 million at 9 p.m.\nThat's an advantage of nearly 30 percent, with The Walking Dead's 6.9 rating in the key demo topping the Olympics' 4.8 rating for the night."}
