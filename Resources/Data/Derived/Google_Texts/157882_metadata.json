There is no floor to this well.\n\nAccording to a new poll conducted by Public Policy Polling, 30% of Republicans are in favor of bombing the city of Agrabah. If you aren\u2019t familiar with this region of the world, do not fret. The reason you do not recollect ever hearing about it in geography class is because it doesn\u2019t exist. It is a fictitious town from the Disney animated film, Aladdin. It\u2019s not real.\n\nBy my own admission, I would not have been able to tell you whether Agrabah was from Aladdin or Police Academy 4 if you asked me about the make-believe city prior to this poll. But since I\u2019m not a lunatic (at least most days), I would never have raised my hand if you asked whether I thought people in that country should die.\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\nBut don\u2019t get too boastful, Democrats. According to the same research, 19% of your kind are in favor of murdering cartoon families, too.\n\nThirteen percent of Republicans and 36% of Democrats said they outright opposed bombing the city.\n\nIt is unknown how Americans would respond to the crisis in Jakku.\n\nIf you need to research real estate in other countries, you can do it here.
