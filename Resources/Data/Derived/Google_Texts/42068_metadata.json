Biniecki. (Photo: Courtesy)\n\nOfficials in Sanilac County are looking for ways to slow the number of corrections deputies leaving the county sheriff department.\n\nThe Sanilac County Sheriff Department has lost 11 jailhouse officers through resignation or retirement since 2012, and another five may leave in 2015.\n\nWith a target roster of 28 corrections officers and lengthy, expensive training requirements for new ones, the loss isn\u2019t easy to recoup, said Sanilac County Sheriff Garry Biniecki.\n\n\u201cWhat the county needs to do is look very carefully at the benefit and wage package, which I believe is driving some employees away and may keep some potential employees from coming,\u201d Biniecki said.\n\n\u201cThey need to invest in our future.\u201d\n\nBiniecki said the sheriff department has 22 full-time and three part-time corrections officers. He said two of them finished training last week and two still are in training.\n\nBiniecki estimated it costs about $20,000 and 14 to 16 weeks to train a new jail deputy.\n\nHe said that extra lag time for training prolongs the time the department has to work short-staffed.\n\nBiniecki expects another reason some deputies are leaving is the added burden of federal inmates who are lodged in the jail \u2014 a number that has almost doubled since the county completed its jail addition in July 2013, while the number of corrections deputies stayed roughly the same.\n\nOn Thursday, the jail housed 90 federal inmates and 56 county inmates. The jail is licensed to hold 168 inmates.\n\nBiniecki said in 2014 the bed rental program put about $2.4 million into the county general fund.\n\n\u201cThe county benefits directly from those bed rentals,\u201d Biniecki said. \u201cBut there\u2019s no added benefit for guarding that extra inmate.\u201d\n\nJustin Faber, chairman for the Sanilac County Board of Commissioners, said commissioners have asked Biniecki to give a presentation on how many have left, and why they\u2019re leaving.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d liked to see some statistics about why people are leaving and where they\u2019re going to,\u201d Faber said.\n\nFaber said in the years since the Affordable Care Act went into play changes have been made to county insurance policies and part-time hours.\n\nThe county used to pay 100 percent of health care premiums. Now, employees are required to contribute to the health plan depending on his or her level of coverage.\n\nPart-time deputies that formerly worked longer hours now must be kept to 29 or fewer hours, otherwise the county must provide insurance for them.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t use part-time help like we did in the past,\u201d Faber said.\n\nFaber said the board recently hired the Michigan Municipal League to conduct a wage study, which focused solely on wages and not benefits.\n\n\u201cThat wage study did find that some employees were underpaid and some were not so much,\u201d Faber said. \u201cThe board is taking a look at how we can fix those things.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in an area where we\u2019re not always the top-paying, but we need to pay our people fairly.\u201d\n\nFaber said the county currently is in union negotiations with the local Police Officers Association of Michigan and Command Officers Association of Michigan.\n\nHe hopes that the board can come to a solution through those negotiations and Biniecki\u2019s input on the problem.\n\nBiniecki said he expects to address the board later this month.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://bwne.ws/1C7fTo2", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Sheriff Department is having trouble finding and keeping corrections deputies.", "og": {"site_name": "The Times Herald", "description": "Sheriff Department is having trouble finding and keeping corrections deputies.", "title": "Sanilac Sheriff wants to stem corrections deputies loss", "url": "http://www.thetimesherald.com/story/news/local/2015/04/05/sanilac-sheriff-wants-stem-corrections-deputies-loss/25333353/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/thetimesherald.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Sheriff Department is having trouble finding and keeping corrections deputies.", "creator": "@thetimesherald", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/db85f84dfd29bf7a0a94d85bbd8793f1313451b3/c=10-0-1794-1784&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/PortHuron/2015/04/05/B9316839231Z.1_20150405160911_000_GV3ADEGNU.1-0.jpg", "title": "Sanilac Sheriff wants to stem corrections deputies loss", "site": "@thetimesherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=879158423", "fb": {"app_id": 112964595441805}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde344\"", "article_summary": "(Photo: Courtesy)Officials in Sanilac County are looking for ways to slow the number of corrections deputies leaving the county sheriff department.\nWith a target roster of 28 corrections officers and lengthy, expensive training requirements for new ones, the loss isn\u2019t easy to recoup, said Sanilac County Sheriff Garry Biniecki.\nSanilac County Sheriff Garry M.
