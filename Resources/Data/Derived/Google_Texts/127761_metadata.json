People have been talking about \u201csmart\u201d appliances for years now\u2014\u201csmart\u201d houses, too. Everything is going to be \u201csmart,\u201d apparently. Personally, I can\u2019t wait until we get \u201csmart\u201d cars\u2014you know, the ones that don\u2019t need drivers. (As opposed to Smart cars.) I remember this as a 1950s advertising campaign that never quite got off the ground\u2014like jetpacks. Which reminds me, where the hell is my jetpack? Anyway, I bet the amount of interesting damage you can do with \u201csmart\u201d cars will be a lot more fun than what you can do with \u201csmart\u201d refrigerators.\n\n\n\nI\u2019m of two minds here. On the one hand, smart homes save energy, all other things being equal. So there are sound environmental reasons for liking the concept. On the other hand, Google just bought Nest Labs, a \u201csmart\u201d thermostat manufacturer\u2014for $3.2 billion. This will allow Google, which does no evil, IIRC, to know when you\u2019re home and when you\u2019re not home, among other things. How this fits into Google\u2019s spate of robotics acquisitions is a bit unclear\u2014although smart robots could certainly dovetail with smart appliances in some potentially interesting ways, I suppose. \u201cSmart\u201d vacuum cleaners may be the next big thing. But if things keep going they way there are, Google (and the rest of the crazy libertarians of silicon valley) are going to be in a position to know a whole lot about you. And the more \u201csmart\u201d the built environment gets, the more vulnerable to refrigerator hackers we get as well.\n\nI do enjoy, just a bit, the irony of Americans freaking about about potential NSA surveillance (which has been going on for decades, BTW), with their enthusiasm for cheerfully sharing their personal information with the corporate world, including Google, not to mention every credit card company on the face of the planet. The fact that this information gets routinely hacked appears to be simply one of costs people seem willing to pay. But with \u201csmart\u201d homes and \u201csmart\u201d buildings and \u201csmart\u201d cars, we\u2019re upping the ante. I go into newer buildings for business meetings where the elevators have no buttons\u2014you key in the floor (or someone does it for you) outside the elevator, and the elevator takes you there\u2014once you\u2019re in the elevator, you have absolutely no control over what happens. I find this just a bit spooky, frankly. Sorry, but I don\u2019t want my elevator, or my car, or my refrigerator, or the airplane I\u2019m flying in, hackable. But maybe that\u2019s just a sign of my age, and I\u2019m just over-reacting.
