So let's look at one key test that could determine how the law is working.\n\nShould the new health insurance exchanges succeed in providing coverage to some 30 million Americans, one of the benchmarks for success would be whether sick Americans actually receive the care they need. Absent universal healthcare \u2014 which the U.S. will not have even after ObamaCare is fully implemented \u2014 this is one of the most contentious side issues of the health care debate.\n\nAccording to a recent survey by the Commonwealth Fund, a health care think tank, \"U.S. adults are significantly more likely than their counterparts to forgo health care because of the cost, to have difficulty paying for care even when they have insurance, and to deal with time-consuming insurance issues.\"\n\nThis may not be good news for policymakers and proponents of ObamaCare. There's little to suggest that the exchanges will reduce overall health care costs, trim paperwork, or make insurance claim processing any easier.\n\nThe Commonwealth Fund, which routinely studies health care in the U.S. and throughout the world, found that complexity in private insurance probably isn't going away. The researchers also found that:\n\nIn 2013, more than one-third (37 percent) of U.S. adults went without recommended care, did not see a doctor when they were sick, or failed to fill prescriptions because of costs, compared with as few as four to six percent in the United Kingdom and Sweden.\n\nRoughly 40 percent of both insured and uninsured U.S. respondents spent $1,000 or more out-of-pocket during the year on medical care, not counting premiums. High deductibles and cost-sharing, along with no limits on out-of-pocket costs, may explain why even insured people in the U.S. struggled to afford needed health care, the researchers said.\n\nNearly one-quarter (23 percent) of U.S. adults either had serious problems paying medical bills or were unable to pay them, compared with fewer than 13 percent of adults in the next-highest country, France, and six percent or fewer in the U.K., Sweden and Norway.\n\nAbout one in three (32 percent) U.S. adults spent a lot of time dealing with insurance paperwork and disputes or were either denied payment for a claim or received less than expected.\n\nCan the cost of insurance paper shuffling be partially driving the high cost of care in the U.S? There is a connection, since U.S. insurers paid $606 per person in administrative costs \u2014 more than twice the amount than in the next-highest country. Keep in mind that money spent on processing claims is not spent on things like preventive or acute care.\n\nSince the Affordable Care Act keeps \u2014 and expands \u2014 the private insurance market, the inefficiency of running a fragmented system will remain. Those who can buy an affordable policy will still have to deal with out-of-pocket costs, provider networks, and uncovered care.\n\nAccess to care and private coverage under the ACA is not to be confused with reining in costs.\n\nIn the U.S., according to Commonwealth, $8,508 is spent per person on health care. \"That is nearly $3,000 more per person than Norway, the second-highest spender,\" the researchers found.\n\nAmericans, however, will still need to make decisions as to when and how to seek health care. For those with the lowest ACA premium plans in the \"catastrophic\" and \"bronze\" categories, for example, some 20 percent of their costs will be uncovered by insurance. Will they choose to forgo emergency room visits that fall under their deductible? Will they skimp on routine care for chronic conditions like diabetes? How will it impact their health over time if they are avoiding care that will prevent future complications?\n\nBefore anyone in Washington does the big picture analysis, though \u2014 which will take years \u2014 state and federal officials still have a few bugs to work out. Oregon's health exchange, for example, doesn't seem to be working at all. The federal Healthcare.gov site is gradually improving, although it's not known if applicants can connect with insurers, who need a set of data files called an 834 EDI transmission, with items like payment information.\n\nAlthough these systems can be fixed over time, we'll then have to see if those who sign up will ultimately get the coverage they need to tackle the most serious conditions they face. Over time, we may look back on the technical woes as a trivial issue compared to how Americans eventually obtain \u2014 or don't obtain \u2014 the care they need.\n\nMore from The Fiscal Times...", "article_metadata": {"description": "Official site of The Week Magazine, offering commentary and analysis of the day's breaking news and current events as well as arts, entertainment, people and gossip, and political cartoons.", "og": {"url": "http://theweek.com/articles/455067/obamacare-actually-make-healthier", "image": "http://api.theweek.com/sites/default/files/styles/tw_image_9_4/public/55258_article_full.jpg?itok=rwN5C2ug", "type": "article", "description": "Let's look at one key test that could determine how the law is working", "title": "Will ObamaCare actually make you healthier?"}, "twitter": {"description": "Let's look at one key test that could determine how the law is working", "creator": "@", "image": {"src": "http://api.theweek.com/sites/default/files/styles/tw_image_9_4/public/55258_article_full.jpg?itok=rwN5C2ug"}, "title": "Will ObamaCare actually make you healthier?", "site": "@theweek", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 10716057521}, "keywords": "feature, Health", "article": {"published_time": "2013-12-05T07:16:00-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcaf67\"", "article_summary": "Absent universal healthcare \u2014 which the U.S. will not have even after ObamaCare is fully implemented \u2014 this is one of the most contentious side issues of the health care debate.\nThere's little to suggest that the exchanges will reduce overall health care costs, trim paperwork, or make insurance claim processing any easier.\nThe Commonwealth Fund, which routinely studies health care in the U.S. and throughout the world, found that complexity in private insurance probably isn't going away.\nSince the Affordable Care Act keeps \u2014 and expands \u2014 the private insurance market, the inefficiency of running a fragmented system will remain.\nShould the new health insurance exchanges succeed in providing coverage to some 30 million Americans, one of the benchmarks for success would be whether sick Americans actually receive the care they need."}
