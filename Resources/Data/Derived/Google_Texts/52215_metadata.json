The $10 million investment will increase patient access and help drive revenue, Rothberger says.\n\n\"It's one of these excellent services we provide that has been limited by size,\" he says. \"We expect it to be a huge growth opportunity.\"\n\nThe expanded outpatient capacity is also expected to result in increased referrals to inpatient services and added patient convenience, Rothberger notes. \"We are trying to feed our large infrastructure on our hospital campuses. We are also trying to reach into the community so people don't have to travel so much. We want to give them the opportunity to see their practitioners closer to home and are trying to offload a lot of expensive work away from the hospital.\"", "article_metadata": {"MobileOptimized": "width", "viewport": "width=device-width", "description": "As provider organizations look ahead to redesigning their care delivery models and taking part in more risk-based payment structures, their capital spending plans must keep pace with their evolving needs.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "HandheldFriendly": "true"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc235\"", "article_summary": "Capital Spending Reflects New Era in HealthcareAs provider organizations look ahead to redesigning their care delivery models and taking part in more risk-based payment structures, their capital spending plans must keep pace with their evolving needs.\nThe expanded outpatient capacity is also expected to result in increased referrals to inpatient services and added patient convenience, Rothberger notes.\n\"As it is being defined now, we are looking at building an 85,000-square-foot building with a parking structure,\" he says.\nRothberger expects the building to be completed in 2016 at a cost of $60 million to $75 million.\nWe are also trying to reach into the community so people don't have to travel so much."}
