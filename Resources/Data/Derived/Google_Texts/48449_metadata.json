But for families in the rodeo world, that bond is carried beyond a genetic or legal one. For them, family means anyone in chaps who has ever ridden a horse or roped a horse. The rodeo community family is a large one and gets passed down through the generations.\n\nTake the Holyan family of Coyote Canyon, New Mexico: Father Ed is an eight-time Indian National Finals Rodeo world champion tie-down rope, and Mother Carole is a world champion ladies barrel racer, as well as the only female INFR commissioner (whose father, Dean, was a founding member and one of the first original commissioners of the INFR organization). Their 12-year-old son Dean, who started roping at age 5, is the 2013 Junior Breakaway champion, while 14-year-old daughter Faith made her first INFR adult division appearance at age 10. And let\u2019s not forget niece Kassidy Dennison who is making her own mark in barrel racing, supported by her mom, Debbie (Carole\u2019s sister) and dad Karl, another world champion\n\n\u201cIndian rodeo is very much a family-oriented event,\u201d says INFR General Manager Donna Hoyt, noting that in some events there are families where three or four generations might be competing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just something we do,\u201d says Carole Holyan. \u201cIn Native cultures, animals are part of the lifestyle. Growing up, my dad had horses and competed in rodeo, and because it was something he did, it was something we did. On the Navajo Nation, rodeo is huge, a way of life for a lot of people.\u201d\n\nWhen the Public Broadcasting System in Wyoming presented a feature story on Indian rodeo, they said: \u201cPresent-day Indian culture encompasses many things including rodeo, which for 40 years has been a professional sport and a nationwide tribal subculture passed from one generation to the next.\u201d Song lyrics from the disco era are appropriate here --- \u201cWe Are Family.\u201d\n\nEd Hoylan is \u201can All-Around Championship Cowboy considered by many to be the most talented and versatile cowboy in the world,\u201d his INFR bio says. Over the last decade or so, Holyan has been a dominant competitor in four All-Around championships as well as titles for steer wrestling and calf roping.\n\n\u201cA good horse, some finesse, and a \u2018no fear\u2019 attitude have helped me reach those pinnacles,\u201d he says. Holyan credits God and the support of his whole family in making possible his arena accolades and that encouragement is evident with wife Carole frequently found near the roping box during tie-down competition.\n\nWhile those are big shoes to fill, his partner in life as well as in the arena, is no stranger to Indian pro rodeo honors. Carole Holyan\u2019s career includes three titles in INFR barrel racing, including her first win in the late 1970s at age 11. She\u2019s also a two-time INFR Women\u2019s All-Around champion and Ladies Breakaway Champion.\n\nAlthough she no longer competes, there is still a family rivalry about gold buckles.\n\nRELATED: Cowboy Crooner and Steer Wrestler Is 'Lovin and Losin' in His Country Music Life\n\n\u201cEd gives me a hard time sometimes because I haven\u2019t caught up with him yet,\u201d she says. \u201cRodeo represents a really large extended family, just something we do and the way we raise our children. Rodeo teaches our youngsters a lot about life; from learning necessary skills to compete to the care and feeding of animals --- all in the company of family and friends.\u201d\n\nThe Holyan family and other inter-generational Native American rodeo families will be on hand to help the largest and longest-running professional Indian rodeo organization in the world \u201cpromote and preserve the advancement of professional Indian rodeo\u201d at this year\u2019s INFR championships, November 4-8, in Las Vegas.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Indian National Finals Rodeo Championships Bringing Families Together", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/08/11/indian-national-finals-rodeo-championships-bringing-families-together-156335", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/infr_rodeo.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Indian National Finals Rodeo Championships Bringing Families Together"}, "abstract": "Indian National Finals Rodeo Championships Bringing Families Together", "dc": {"title": "Indian National Finals Rodeo Championships Bringing Families Together"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/08/11/indian-national-finals-rodeo-championships-bringing-families-together-156335", "dcterms.creator": "rcjohnson", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Indian National Finals Rodeo, rodeo, cowboy, barrel racing, Ed Holyan, family", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.date": "2014-08-11T10:28-04:00", "dcterms.title": "Indian National Finals Rodeo Championships Bringing Families Together"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbc5f\"", "article_summary": "But for families in the rodeo world, that bond is carried beyond a genetic or legal one.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just something we do,\u201d says Carole Holyan.\nThe rodeo community family is a large one and gets passed down through the generations.\nWhile those are big shoes to fill, his partner in life as well as in the arena, is no stranger to Indian pro rodeo honors.\n\u201cRodeo represents a really large extended family, just something we do and the way we raise our children."}
