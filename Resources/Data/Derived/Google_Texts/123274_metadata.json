Lazzara ruled late Friday afternoon that the drug John Andrew Welden tricked his pregnant girlfriend into taking caused the abortion of Remee Jo Lee\u2019s 6-7-week-old unborn baby.\n\n\u201cThere is not a shred of evidence to support the defendant\u2019s suggestion of miscarriage,\u201d he said, after hearing two days of testimony.\n\nWelden\u2019s defense team offered two complementary explanations for why Ms. Lee lost her baby last March, or at least why it could not be attributed to Welden\u2019s actions.\n\nFirst, they called on experts to testify that was not possible to definitively prove that the one 200 microgram dose of Cytotec (misoprostol) Weldon told Lee was an antibiotic caused her abortion. Lazzara rejected that out of hand. Reporting for the Tampa Tribune, Elaine Silvestrini wrote\n\n\u201cThe judge said defense experts merely served as conduits for information they found in scientific literature, which the judge said amounted to no more than case studies with little supporting information. This, he said, was \u2018useless to me in determining a relationship of Misoprostol to a particular side effect.\u2019\u201d\n\nOn Thursday lawyers for Welden tried another tack, citing \u201cmedical records showing Lee was already experiencing bleeding in her seventh week of pregnancy suggesting other factors may have led to the miscarriage,\u201d reported WTSP\u2019s Eric Glasser.\n\nBut Lazzara was having none of that either.\n\n\u201cThe suggestion that prior to the ingestion of this highly toxic drug, this victim was experiencing a spontaneous abortion is just speculation not supported by the record,\u201d Judge Lazzara said. \u201cThe only rational explanation for what caused the demise of the victim\u2019s embryo was her ingestion of one dose of 200 micrograms of Misoprostol.\u201d\n\nWelden\u2019s defense team spared no expense, according to local media reports. \u201cDefense attorneys flew in experts from New York City, one of which was affiliated with the World Health Organization,\u201d according to WFTS\u2019s Jacqueline Ingles.\n\n\u201cWelden\u2019s stepmother said she was disappointed in the ruling because the defense\u2019s experts are \u2018world renowned, \u2018\u201d Ingles reported. \u201cHowever, the judge was not impressed with their lofty resumes and discounted their testimony.\u201d\n\nWelden\u2019s father, Dr. Stephen Welden, told Glasser that over the next two weeks he\u2019d be \u201ctelling John Welden what a father \u2018normally would tell his son. That he loves him. You want a future for him and I\u2019m still praying for a miracle.\u2019\u201d\n\nLee was not in court Friday and her parents were unwilling to speak on her behalf.\n\nThe prosecution said Welden\u2019s motivation was that he wanted to keep his other girlfriend from learning of Lee\u2019s pregnancy.\n\nLast September Welden pleaded guilty to lesser charges of consumer product tampering and conspiracy to commit mail fraud as part of a plea bargain to avoid first-degree murder charges under the NRLC-inspired Unborn Victims of Violence Act. The agreement between prosecutors and Foster recommended a prison term of 13 years and eight months for Welden.\n\nWhether Judge Lazzara sticks with the sentence agreed to by both parties will not be known until January 27.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://www.nationalrighttolifenews.org/news/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/JohnAndrewWelden7-300x199.jpg"}, "bitly-verification": "3d313669c834"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3f3e\"", "article_summary": "Whether Judge Lazzara sticks with the sentence agreed to by both parties will not be known until January 27.\nBy Dave AndruskoU.S. District Judge Richard A.
