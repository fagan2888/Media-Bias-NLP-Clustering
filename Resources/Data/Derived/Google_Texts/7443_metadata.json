This year some Californians will be with their families years, even decades earlier than they planned. They\u2019re prisoners released under Proposition 47, a sweeping change to California\u2019s criminal justice law, which has had an effect on the tough sentencing law known as Three Strikes.* Prop 47 downgrades six felony crimes\u2014shoplifting, grand theft, receiving stolen property, writing bad checks, forgery, and drug possession\u2014to misdemeanors, depending on their record and the severity of their offenses. Those convicted of violent crimes are not eligible.\n\nThe formerly incarcerated can petition to have a felony reclassified to a misdemeanor. Those currently incarcerated can apply for re-sentencing of any felony on their record. And new offenders convicted of one of those six crimes will be charged with misdemeanors\u2026 again, with some restrictions.\n\nThe seismic jolt of Prop 47 will have ripple effects on the state for years to come. The law could allow up to one in five inmates from state prisons, and that would create a strain on courts and public defenders. And it will stretch reentry service organizations challenged with keeping the formerly incarcerated out of the prison system for good. FSRN\u2019s Larry Buhl has more from Los Angeles.\n\nDownload Audio\n\nTwo months ago, George Gutierrez was sitting in the LA county jail, charged with possession of a controlled substance and facing up to 4 years in prison. Then on November 4, California voters passed Prop 47, and he was released with 78 days of time served.\n\n\u201cSo this did help me out,\u201d Guiterrez said. \u201cI realized that I got a chance, a second chance and I took the opportunity to put myself into a treatment home and build a strong foundation for myself so I won\u2019t go back.\u201d\n\nSoon after his release, Gutierrez found a drug treatment facility. And he heard about the Center for Living and Learning, a nonprofit in Van Nuys, California that provides employment and mentoring services, specializing in those coming out of drug treatment, incarceration, and welfare to work.\n\nWilliam Gerk also uses the Center for Living and Learning for career counseling. He\u2019s applied to have his drug possession felony reclassified, which he says will permit him to better reintegrate into society.\n\n\u201cNow as a felon, I have to make sure I have at least a dollar in my pocket before I go into a store or I can be chose to be a person that\u2019s in there to be with no money in my pocket,\u201d explains Gerk. \u201cAs a felon I lose lot of freedoms, not just by law but as a human being. And so this probation and the restrictions they have, hopefully they\u2019ll change with the proposition. But what I\u2019m into right now, it\u2019s so stifling, it\u2019s hard to breathe. It\u2019s like being in fresh air on top of a mountain but not being able to breathe.\u201d\n\nA felony conviction can affect individuals long after their release. It can lead to denial of jobs, student loans, food stamps and certain types of housing.\n\nBut there\u2019s a catch-22 for some.\n\nThe state will only pay for reentry services for those with felony convictions, who are under supervision. And reclassification via Prop 47 erases that felony and eliminates that supervision. So that sometimes requires thinking carefully about when to file the reclassification paperwork.\n\nMaria Alexander is the executive director of the Center for Living and Learning. She says they continue to help people regardless, \u201cbut if they weren\u2019t in a stable living situation, and they didn\u2019t have family they could go, to we certainly would advise them, \u2018let\u2019s wait until you\u2019re on your feet and you have a place to live\u2019 because we don\u2019t know how long this process will go and I don\u2019t expect it will go that fast. But until we know that we don\u2019t want to go to someone in transitional living \u2018let\u2019s do that paperwork now\u2019 and have them out of a place to live.\u201d\n\nReentry service organizations say they haven\u2019t been flooded with Prop 47-related requests, at least not yet, but they are expecting a wave. The question is, how will these providers serve everyone who would have been covered by government dollars?\n\nProp 47 allocates some of the money saved on incarceration and pursuing felonies to a Safe and Just fund, which goes to treatment, education and victim services. But the funds won\u2019t be coming until 2016. And given the number of Californians eligible for resentencing and reclassification \u2013 up to 300,00 are expected in LA County alone \u2014 when the money does come, it might not be enough.\n\nBut Prop 47 could lead to big savings in many California agencies, and that would mean a lot of so-called \u201cgray money\u201d sitting in the criminal justice system. Some drug policy reformers want to pressure agencies channel unused funds towards reentry services.\n\n\u201cWhat happens to all of that money?\u201d asks Lynne Lyman, California Director of the Drug Policy Alliance, a strong advocate of Prop 47, as well as Prop 36, which passed in 2012.\u201d They\u2019re trying to build a new jail for two billion dollars, and we\u2019re saying, no we need to invest in services to reduce recidivism and reduce the size of our jail, and you could say the same for drug courts.\u201d\n\nProp 36 made felons whose third strike was not for a violent crime eligible for reduced sentences. But it provided no reentry help. So Lyman and colleagues created a special scholarship fund of several million dollars, using voluntary donations from different agencies.\n\nNow Lyman is proposing a similar fund for Prop 47 cases. Only this pool has to be much larger, to accommodate everyone who will need the services.\n\n\u201cSetting aside an allotment of funds to provide services to people, who if you don\u2019t provide the services may become homeless and then cost the system much more money, it just makes humane and economic sense,\u201d Lyman says.\n\nOne key service, drug treatment, is more widely available than ever. Since the roll out of the Affordable Care Act, free drug treatment programs at the county level have expanded throughout the state.\n\nGeorge Gutierrez says he\u2019ll soon transition into a sober living home, and start applying for jobs in construction.\n\nMaria Alexander says she\u2019ll apply to have her own decades-old felony drug conviction downgraded under prop 47, but she\u2019s not in a hurry. She originally came to the Center for Living and Learning as a client, and now that she\u2019s leading it, she\u2019s not planning to move on any time soon. That makes her one of the few Californians whose felony record is not a career obstacle.\n\n*This sentence was modified to clarify that the reclassification of some felonies under Prop 47 changed California criminal justice law in general, and not just sentences related to Three Strikes.", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The seismic jolt of Prop 47 will have ripple effects on the state for years to come.\nThen on November 4, California voters passed Prop 47, and he was released with 78 days of time served.\nMaria Alexander says she\u2019ll apply to have her own decades-old felony drug conviction downgraded under prop 47, but she\u2019s not in a hurry.\nNow Lyman is proposing a similar fund for Prop 47 cases.\nSince the roll out of the Affordable Care Act, free drug treatment programs at the county level have expanded throughout the state."}
