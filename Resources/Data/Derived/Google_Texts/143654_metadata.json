The attack on a security checkpoint in the northern al-Husseiniya district killed nine people and wounded 28 others.\n\nThere was no immediate claim of responsibility for the second bombing, which targeted an army convoy in Arab al-Jabour, an area of date palm groves on Baghdad's southern outskirts. Three people were killed there, and 11 others were wounded.\n\nThe Iraqi government has retaken several major cities from Islamic State in the past year, including the western cities of Ramadi and Hit, and slowly pushed the militants back towards the Syrian border.\n\nSecurity has gradually improved in Baghdad, which witnessed daily attacks a decade ago, though bombings against the security forces and Shi'ite residential or commercial areas are still a regular occurrence. A blast claimed by Islamic State hit a Shi'ite Muslim mosque on Friday.\n\nThe rise of the ultra-hardline Sunni group, which is battling government forces over control of vast territory in northern and western Iraq, has exacerbated a long-running sectarian conflict, mostly between Shi'ites and Sunnis, that emerged after the U.S.-led invasion in 2003.\n\n(Reporting by Kareem Raheem; Writing by Stephen Kalin; Editing by Alison Williams)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/23/least-12-dead-two-Baghdad-car-bomb-attacks-sources", "type": "article", "site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Islamic State was behind the larger blast, according to the Amaq news agency which sup", "title": "At least 12 dead in two Baghdad car bomb attacks: sources"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/23/least-12-dead-two-Baghdad-car-bomb-attacks-sources", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Islamic State was behind the larger blast, according to the Amaq news agency which sup", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Islamic State was behind the larger blast, according to the Amaq news agency which supports the group.\nA blast claimed by Islamic State hit a Shi'ite Muslim mosque on Friday.\nSecurity has gradually improved in Baghdad, which witnessed daily attacks a decade ago, though bombings against the security forces and Shi'ite residential or commercial areas are still a regular occurrence.\nThe attack on a security checkpoint in the northern al-Husseiniya district killed nine people and wounded 28 others.\nThe Iraqi government has retaken several major cities from Islamic State in the past year, including the western cities of Ramadi and Hit, and slowly pushed the militants back towards the Syrian border."}
