Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., are the political faces of the group No Labels. And while they\u2019ve worked together in that regard, they\u2019ve played too, as Huntsman can attest.\n\n\u201cWe hang out, we\u2019re friends, our families are friends,\u201d the ex-Utah governor tells Whispers at Wednesday\u2019s National Strategic Agenda conference in Washington, being put on by the No Labels Foundation.\n\nSo what do they do exactly?\n\nWell, first, they fish. \u201cI did out-fish him,\u201d Huntsman says. \u201cI think I caught three fish and he may have caught one and a half \u2013 it was so small I counted it as a half.\u201d The duo, whose group tries to give Capitol Hill Republicans and Democrats political cover to work across the aisle, has spent time together both in West Virginia and in the nation\u2019s capital, where the Huntsmans reside these days.\n\nThey\u2019ve also taken at least one joy ride. \u201cDriving the country roads of West Virginia,\u201d Huntsman says, pausing before he reveals more details. \u201cWell, is somebody going to send me a speeding ticket ex post facto?\u201d\n\nHuntsman took Manchin out in a Ford Shelby Mustang. \u201cI\u2019m on the board of Ford Motor Co. \u2013 I only drive one kind of car,\u201d Huntsman explains, saying the West Virginia Democrat wasn\u2019t nervous. In fact, Manchin wanted to see what the car could do. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018Well, is this road capable of high-performance vehicles?\u2019\u201d Huntsman recalls. \u201cHe said, \u2018I built this road as governor, I can vouch for this road.\u2019\u201d\n\nMore seriously though, both men became governors in 2004, and that\u2019s when they first got to know each other. It hasn\u2019t always been fun and games. \u201cWe became particularly close when, tragically, Utah had a mining disaster not long after West Virginia had a very high-profile mining disaster,\u201d Huntsman says. \u201cI had no playbook \u2013 they don\u2019t tell you how to handle these things when you\u2019re elected governor.\u201d So Huntsman rang up Manchin.\n\nIn 2010, they announced a new partnership in No Labels, a group aiming to be an antidote to today\u2019s extreme partisanship. This cycle so far, No Labels has mostly been known for creating awkwardness among Senate Democrats when, as Yahoo News reported, the group supported Republican Cory Gardner in the Colorado Senate race over Manchin\u2019s Democratic peer, Sen. Mark Udall. (No Labels later clarified and explained that any pol who becomes a member of the organization gets its \u201csupport.\u201d)\n\nA leaked document, also reported by Yahoo, didn\u2019t help matters because it hinted the group would gain from Republicans taking the Senate.\n\n\u201cShould the balance of power in the U.S. Senate flip following the 2014 midterm elections and Republicans gain control, No Labels sees an opportunity to bridge the gap between Congress and the White House,\u201d the document read.\n\nBut Manchin continues with the group, sharing the podium with Huntsman for most of the morning. At least one other Senate Dem, Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut, also showed (though he argued aggressively with Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., over immigration).\n\nA bipartisan assortment of House members joined the gathering as well, including Reps. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., Matt Salmon, R-Ariz., Kurt Schrader, D-Ore., and Ami Bera, D-Calif., who\u2019s in a politically precarious situation going into the midterms. Being part of No Labels, Bera touted, might help him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in one of the most contested races in the country, but this is about \u2026 building relationships,\u201d Bera proclaimed.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Washington Whispers [News]", "title": "Jon Huntsman on Joe Manchin: We Hang Out", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "The former Republican governor and current Democratic senator are still trying to make \u2018No Labels\u2019 happen.", "title": "Huntsman on Manchin: We Hang Out", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/washington-whispers/2014/09/17/jon-huntsman-on-joe-manchin-we-hang-out", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/79/11/8aa4482445098491cda85d9b0540/140917-huntsmanmanchin-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@USNews", "description": "The former Republican governor and current Democratic senator are still trying to make \u2018No Labels\u2019 happen.", "card": "summary", "title": "Jon Huntsman on Joe Manchin: We Hang Out"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "news", "date_published": "Sept. 17, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Nikki Schwab,Pulse,picks,Huntsman, Jon,Manchin, Joe,Washington Whispers [News]", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "The former Republican governor and current Democratic senator are still trying to make \u2018No Labels\u2019 happen."}, "article_summary": "Former GOP presidential candidate Jon Huntsman and Sen.
