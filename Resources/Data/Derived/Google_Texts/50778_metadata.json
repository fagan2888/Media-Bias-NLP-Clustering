The blasts also injured 286 people.\n\n\u201cTwo firefighters are unaccounted for and efforts to find them are continuing,\u201d National Fire Agency Deputy Director Chen Wen-long said by phone. Woody Duh, deputy minister of economic affairs, called the incident the deadliest industrial accident in Taiwan\u2019s history.\n\nThe municipal government ordered the suspension of four petrochemical pipelines running through the area while the investigation is carried out, Duh said.\n\nPressure Drop\n\nA pipeline channeling propylene between China General Terminal & Distribution Corp. and LCY Chemical facilities showed a drop in pressure at 8:43 p.m. on July 31, Kaohsiung\u2019s government said in the statement. LCY Chemical didn\u2019t ask China General to stop delivery immediately nor report to the environmental protection bureau, allowing a large amount of propylene to leak for three hours, it said.\n\nLCY Chemical said yesterday its pipeline was located about 10 meters (33 feet) away from the explosion sites.\n\n\u201cWe will comply with investigations to clarify causes,\u201d Pan said at a briefing earlier today. The spokeswoman declined at the time to say whether there were leaks from the pipeline.\n\nThe blasts affected 32,968 households and 83,819 people, cutting gas supplies to about 23,600 households, according to Taiwan\u2019s cabinet. More than 2,000 military servicemen were dispatched to assist with the rescue.\n\nFactory operations at Asia Polymer Corp., USI Corp., and China General Plastics Corp. remained normal as only the underground piping systems in areas affected by the explosions were halted, the companies said in stock exchange filings.\n\nChina Petrochemical Development Corp. will increase ground transport of materials and will cut production for a week. Revenue will be reduced by NT$36 million ($1.2 million), it said in a statement to the exchange today.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Adela Lin", "twitter": {"description": "Rescuers continued to comb through debris from deadly gas explosions looking for survivors as Taiwan\u2019s second-biggest city pinned responsibility for at least 28 deaths on a company that piped gas underground.", "title": "Taiwan Blames Chemicals Company for Deadly Kaohsiung Explosions", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-08-02/rescuers-seek-survivors-of-taiwan-blasts-that-left-27-dead", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iBdRZXgx8FpA/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "site": "@business", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-author": "Adela Lin", "parsely-type": "post", "keywords": "LCY Chemical Corp,Taiwan", "news_keywords": "LCY Chemical Corp,Taiwan", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-08-02/rescuers-seek-survivors-of-taiwan-blasts-that-left-27-dead", "parsely-title": "Taiwan Blames Chemicals Company for Deadly Kaohsiung Explosions", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff0000", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "parsely-pub-date": "2014-08-02T13:32:38.311Z", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "Rescuers continued to comb through debris from deadly gas explosions looking for survivors as Taiwan\u2019s second-biggest city pinned responsibility for at least 28 deaths on a company that piped gas underground.", "parsely-tags": "LCY Chemical Corp,Taiwan,Region: Global,Page: article", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.bwbx.io/business/public/images/favicons/mstile-144x144-bbd2101292.png", "date": "2014-08-02T13:32:38.311Z", "parsely-section": "industries", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "og": {"site_name": "Bloomberg.com", "description": "Rescuers continued to comb through debris from deadly gas explosions looking for survivors as Taiwan\u2019s second-biggest city pinned responsibility for at least 28 deaths on a company that piped gas underground.", "title": "Taiwan Blames Chemicals Company for Deadly Kaohsiung Explosions", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-08-02/rescuers-seek-survivors-of-taiwan-blasts-that-left-27-dead", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iBdRZXgx8FpA/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "type": "website"}, "fb": {"status": "Rescuers continued to comb through debris from deadly gas explosions looking for survivors as Taiwan\u2019s second-biggest city pinned responsibility for at least 28 deaths on a company that piped gas underground."}, "parsely-post-id": "N9O1S66S972C01", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "parsely-image-url": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iBdRZXgx8FpA/v1/-1x-1.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd82cd\"", "article_summary": "LCY Chemical said yesterday its pipeline was located about 10 meters (33 feet) away from the explosion sites.\nLCY Chemical spokeswoman Abby Pan didn\u2019t answer two calls to her office phone after the release of the city\u2019s statement.\nFactory operations at Asia Polymer Corp., USI Corp., and China General Plastics Corp. remained normal as only the underground piping systems in areas affected by the explosions were halted, the companies said in stock exchange filings.\nRescuers continued to comb through debris from deadly gas explosions looking for survivors as Taiwan\u2019s second-biggest city pinned responsibility for at least 28 deaths on a company that piped gas underground.\nChina Petrochemical Development Corp. will increase ground transport of materials and will cut production for a week."}
