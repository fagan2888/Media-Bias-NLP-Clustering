Photo by Kevin Lamarque/Reuters\n\nOne of the most interesting findings of the respected Pew Research Center\u2019s poll of American Jews was the continuing theme of Jewish liberalism and approval of Barack Obama\u2019s performance \u2014 a vote of confidence in the president exceeded only by that of African-American Protestants and Hispanic Catholics.\n\n\u201cJews are among the most strongly liberal, Democratic groups in U.S. politics,\u201d the Pew report said. \u201cThere are more than twice as many self-identified Jewish liberals as conservatives, while among the general public, this balance is nearly reversed. In addition, about seven-in-ten Jews identify with or lean toward the Democratic Party. Jews are more supportive of President Barack Obama than are most other religious groups. And about eight-in-ten Jews say homosexuality should be accepted by society.\u201d\n\nThe survey is a landmark in research on the Jewish states of mind, the first such major survey since the National Jewish Population Survey of 2000-2001. It digs deeply into religious practice, participation in community activities, educational and economic attainment, demographics, and social and political views. It will help shape writing, commentary and research on Jewish American life for years to come.\n\nIt was taken between Feb. 20 and June 13 of this year, including a diverse sampling of 3,475 Jews, who are representative of the 6 million-plus American Jews.\n\nThe pollsters were aware of the difficulty of defining who is a Jew. \u201cThis is an ancient question with no single, timeless answer,\u201d they said. They divided Jews in two ways. One was by religion \u2014 those who \u201csay their religion is Jewish (and who do not profess any other religion).\u201d The other was \u201cJews of no religion \u2014 people who describe themselves \u2026 as atheist, agnostic or nothing in particular, but who have a Jewish parent or were raised Jewish and who still consider themselves Jewish in some way.\u201d Interestingly, the survey found that the overwhelming majority of Jews considered themselves Jewish by religion.\n\nThe findings on Jewish attitudes toward Obama come at a significant time. While the Pew pollsters were in the field, the president was under fire for his policies on Syria, Iran and Israel, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu clearly didn\u2019t like the way he was going.\n\nIn addition, he was headed toward yet another brutal confrontation with Republicans, especially the GOP in the House of Representatives. His approval ratings in national polls had dropped sharply since his 2012 re-election.\n\nThat drop wasn\u2019t the case among Jews. A total of 65 percent of those surveyed by Pew said they approved of the way Obama was doing his job. Both women and men felt the same way, by just about the same percentage \u2014 a contrast to surveys of the general population, which show Obama more popular among women. The same is also true among age groups \u2014 with 64 percent of Jews over 50 approving of him and 66 percent of those under 50 agreeing.\n\nOnly African-American Protestants, with 88 percent, and Hispanic Catholics, 76 percent, give the president higher approval ratings.\n\nHowever, the same percentages of Orthodox Jews do not share these beliefs, particularly the ultra-Orthodox, the survey found. For example, 82 percent of Jews overall feel that homosexuality should be accepted by society, while 58 percent of the Orthodox Jews felt it should be discouraged, with that sentiment reaching 70 percent among the ultra-Orthodox. And just 33 percent of Orthodox Jews gave Obama a favorable job-performance rating, with the number even lower among the ultra-Orthodox, 28 percent.\n\nThis minority is growing. The Orthodox Jewish community has double the birthrate of the rest of the Jews, and it is substantially younger. Those trends add up to increased Orthodox influence in the political world if they chose to use it.\n\nJewish Republicans have tried to mobilize them in past presidential elections, but, so far, each time the Democratic candidate has received a solid majority, the numbers hardly wavering from one election to the next.\n\nBut in recent weeks, their efforts have been damaged by the cadre of radical Republicans in the House, and by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who closed down the federal government in their effort to kill the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare.\n\nYou might think the Republicans are on the right track after the Obamacare Web sites\u2019 troubled introduction, and after months of conservative attacks on the ACA, with polls showing that, while negative sentiment is declining, the Affordable Care Act is still unpopular.\n\nBut that\u2019s not the case with Jews. They back Obamacare. The American Jewish Committee\u2019s Web site noted that most public opinion polls show a majority of Jews favor the ACA. The Pew survey explains why.\n\nThe poll shows that even among the irreligious, Jewish identity is intertwined with feelings of obligation to society and remembrance of how Jews have been persecuted. Jews worry about the underdogs, who are on the difficult road that they, their parents or grandparents traveled.\n\nThe Holocaust is deep in Jewish consciousness. Pew reported that roughly seven in 10 U.S. Jews (73 percent) say remembering the Holocaust is an essential part of what being Jewish means to them. Nearly as many say leading an ethical and moral life is essential to what it means to be Jewish. And a majority of U.S. Jews say working for justice and equality in society is essential to being Jewish.\n\nThe hard-hearted Republican conduct of the past weeks, plus the House Republicans\u2019 willingness to shut down badly needed government services run counter to those feelings. That will likely shape how a majority of Jews vote in the 2014 midterm election, as well as in 2016, when the country picks a successor to Barack Obama.\n\nBill Boyarsky is a columnist for the Jewish Journal, Truthdig and L.A.
