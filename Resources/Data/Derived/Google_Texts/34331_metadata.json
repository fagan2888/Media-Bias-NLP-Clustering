However, due to a discovered loophole as confirmed within a new Health Affairs study, hospitals are now increasingly renaming Medicare patient readmissions as \u201cobservation stays\u201d or are providing care for returning Medicare patients in the Emergency Room (ER) to thwart Medicare's financial penalties.\n\nThis idea is confirmed within Health Affairs by researchers David U. Himmelstein, MD, FACP, Professor at the City University of New York School of Public Health at Hunter College and Lecturer of Medicine at Harvard Medical School and Steffie Woolhandler, MD, MPH, FACP, Professor in the CUNY School of Public Health at Hunter College, Adjunct Clinical Professor at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, and Lecturer in Medicine at Harvard Medical School.\n\nAlthough the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) maintains a recent decline in hospital readmissions among Medicare patients is \u201ca major advance for patient safety,\u201d Himmelstein and Woolhandler say reality paints quite a different picture. \u201c[Lost] amidst the celebration is the fact that hospitals are increasingly \u2018observing\u2019 patients (or treating returning patients in the emergency department) rather than \u2018readmitting\u2019 them,\u201d Himmelstein and Woolhandler state. \u201cBut while re-labeling helps hospitals meet CMS\u2019 quality standards (and avoid costly fines), it probably signals little real quality gain and often leaves patients worse off financially,\u201d they add.\n\nNearly 10 percent of hospital stays occurring within 30 days of discharge are classified under \u201cobservation,\u201d maintain researchers. One in four hospitals classified at least 14 percent of all repeat stays as falling under the \u201cobservation\u201d category. \u201c[Analysis] of time trends in observation stays makes it clear that they account for a significant chunk of the reduction in readmissions,\u201d researchers say. \u201cBetween 2010 and 2013, 36 percent of the claimed decrease in readmissions was actually just a shift to observation stays,\u201d they add.\n\nMore discharged patients are being treated in the ED without admission, the researchers claim. \u201cMedicare rewards both approaches equally, but for hospitals, re-labeling is probably far cheaper (and more profitable) than re-designing. Medicare\u2019s readmission penalties are among the growing number of pay-for-performance (P4P) and value-based purchasing initiatives that offer bonuses to high performers and/or penalize the laggards,\u201d the authors add.\n\nHimmelstein and Woolhandler conclude their research about Medicare readmission penalties with the following sentiment: \u201cBecome good at cheating and you never need to become good at anything else.\u201d\n\nResearchers highlight an additional \"shocking\" ACA flaw\n\nAs RevCycleIntelligence.com reported last June, Himmelstein and Woolhandler previously confirmed a series of other dramatic flaws connected to the ACA with \"shocking\" research \u2013 most notably that the ACA promotes billions of dollars in bureaucratic waste with the bureaucracy gobbling up over a quarter of federal spending.\n\n\u201cWe are wasting an enormous amount of money that ought to go to healthcare on paperwork,\u201d said Himmelstein in a personal interview with RevCycleIntelligence.com. \u201cThere is no reason, other than political difficulty, that we can\u2019t shed massive bureaucratic costs,\u201d he added. Himmelstein and Woolhandler confirmed CMS\u2019s projection of $2.7 trillion in spending for private insurance overhead and administering government health problems \u2013 chiefly Medicare and Medicaid \u2013 between 2014 and 2022, including a quite sizable $273 billion in new administrative costs tied to the ACA.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Due to a loophole, hospitals are renaming Medicare patient readmissions as \u201cobservation stays\u201d or are providing care for returning Medicare patients in the ER.", "author": "RevCycleIntelligence", "og": {"url": "http://revcycleintelligence.com/news/hospitals-dodge-financial-penalty-with-medicare-aca-loophole", "site_name": "RevCycleIntelligence", "image": "http://revcycleintelligence.com/images/site/articles/imageedit_5_7966748367.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Hospitals Dodge Financial Penalty with Medicare ACA Loophole"}, "twitter": {"description": "Due to a loophole, hospitals are renaming Medicare patient readmissions as \u201cobservation stays\u201d or are providing care for returning Medicare patients in the ER.", "creator": "@RevCycleIntel", "image": {"src": "http://revcycleintelligence.com/images/site/articles/imageedit_5_7966748367.jpg"}, "title": "Hospitals Dodge Financial Penalty with Medicare ACA Loophole", "site": "@RevCycleIntel", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbe50\"", "article_summary": "According to the Affordable Care Act (ACA), hospitals demonstrating low quality measures face financial penalties under Medicare.\n\u201cBetween 2010 and 2013, 36 percent of the claimed decrease in readmissions was actually just a shift to observation stays,\u201d they add.\nHowever, due to a discovered loophole as confirmed within a new Health Affairs study, hospitals are now increasingly renaming Medicare patient readmissions as \u201cobservation stays\u201d or are providing care for returning Medicare patients in the Emergency Room (ER) to thwart Medicare's financial penalties.\n\u201cMedicare rewards both approaches equally, but for hospitals, re-labeling is probably far cheaper (and more profitable) than re-designing.\n\u201c[Analysis] of time trends in observation stays makes it clear that they account for a significant chunk of the reduction in readmissions,\u201d researchers say."}
