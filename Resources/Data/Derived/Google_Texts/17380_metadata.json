As The New American reported in January, the latest Congressional Budget Office projections have the federal government spending nearly $2 trillion over the next decade to insure fewer than half of uninsured Americans.\n\nMoreover, as Gingrich pointed out, most of the increase in coverage has come about by \u201cdramatically expand[ing] Medicaid,\u201d which is an \u201ceasy short-term fix.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe problem then becomes,\u201d he continued, \u201cwho\u2019s going to pay for Medicaid.\u201d (Answer: taxpayers until they are bled dry.)\n\nAnother problem with the expansion of Medicaid is that the program already pays well below doctors\u2019 actual costs. That\u2019s why, according to a survey by healthcare-staffing firm Merritt Hawkins, in 2013 only half of family doctors were accepting Medicaid patients. Adding even more people to the Medicaid rolls has only exacerbated the matter: A December report from the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Office of Inspector General found that just half of physicians who accept Medicaid patients are taking new ones.\n\n\u201cHaving insurance with no doctor may not be better than having a doctor with no insurance,\u201d observed Gingrich.\n\nThe individual mandate, too, isn\u2019t quite working as expected, he said, pointing to the fact that \u201ca lot of people are paying the penalty rather than being in the mandate.\u201d\n\nChallenged by O\u2019Donnell about his past support for an individual mandate, Gingrich said that he no longer favors it \u201cbecause in order to make an individual mandate work, you have to move to an extraordinarily authoritarian system.\u201d Yet Gingrich is known to have stumped for a mandate as early as 1993 \u2014 claiming it was the conservative alternative to the complete nationalization of healthcare being pushed at the time by then-First Lady Hillary Clinton \u2014 and continued speaking in favor of it until just before he jumped into the 2012 presidential race. Considering that it should have been obvious from day one that enforcing an individual mandate would require authoritarian means, one suspects that politics, rather than principle, have shaped Gingrich\u2019s view of the mandate over the years.\n\nIn spite of his misgivings about many aspects of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), Gingrich made it clear that he\u2019s not in favor of repealing it.\n\n\u201cThere are a certain number of people from your party that say they just want [the ACA] repealed,\u201d O\u2019Donnell said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t sound like you agree with that.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, they don\u2019t, either,\u201d replied Gingrich, precipitating a round of laughter from both O\u2019Donnell and the audience. Instead, he said, they\u2019ll just repeal the parts they don\u2019t like while retaining the politically popular ones.\n\nFor instance, the individual mandate is unpopular, but the provision forcing insurers to cover all applicants regardless of pre-existing conditions is well-liked, so Congress might want to repeal the former but not the latter. But doing that, he averred, would \u201ccreate a death spiral in which people never buy insurance till they\u2019re sick\u201d \u2014 something that may already be happening with the full ACA in place but could become far worse if it were only partially repealed.\n\nGingrich, not quite grasping the economic or constitutional issues at stake, then suggested an alternative: \u201csome system that says once you buy your first insurance, as long as you\u2019re paying insurance, you cannot be denied coverage.\u201d\n\nAnother popular provision that the GOP probably wouldn\u2019t jettison is the one allowing children to remain on their parents\u2019 health insurance until age 26. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s repealable,\u201d Gingrich said.\n\n\u201cSo,\u201d he continued, \u201cif you actually went down [to Congress] and said, \u2018Now, when you say you want to repeal everything, how about these five things?\u2019 you\u2019d suddenly find, well, repeal sort of means repeal but not necessarily repeal, but it\u2019s a kind of repeal that you\u2019d really like because it\u2019s only the parts you want to repeal, it\u2019s not the parts you don\u2019t want to repeal because we\u2019re only going to repeal the things that need to be repealed.\u201d\n\nGingrich was, of course, being somewhat facetious, but his point is borne out by the GOP\u2019s most recent ObamaCare repeal-and-replace proposal. Unveiled in early February, it calls for, among other things, preventing insurers from denying coverage as long as the covered individual has paid his premiums faithfully in the past, retaining the provision allowing children to remain on their parents\u2019 coverage into young adulthood, subsidizing insurance premiums, and otherwise continuing many of the ACA\u2019s policies with only slight modifications \u2014 hence the Washington Post's reference to the plan as \u201cObamacare Lite.\u201d\n\nDespite his ongoing posturing as a conservative \u2014 Gingrich told O\u2019Donnell that \u201ccentralized, bureaucratic solutions are increasingly obsolete\u201d \u2014 the former House Speaker remains ever in thrall to command-and-control approaches to solving mankind\u2019s problems. (He even called for a \u201cnational brain project\u201d as a way of addressing the growing challenge of Alzheimer\u2019s disease.) Sadly, so do most of his comrades in the Republican Party.\n\nPhoto of Newt Gingrich: AP Images", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Gingrich, ObamaCare, Republicans, repeal", "og": {"url": "http://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/health-care/item/20543-gingrich-i-don-t-want-to-repeal-obamacare-and-neither-does-congress", "image": "http://www.thenewamerican.com/media/k2/items/cache/0bdb2b54d3d73c074d5cbe896582fd39_XL.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, despite misgivings about ObamaCare, doesn't want it repealed and doesn't think congressional Republicans do, either.
