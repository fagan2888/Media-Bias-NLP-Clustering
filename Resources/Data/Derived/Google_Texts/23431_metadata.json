You could see the big shoulders and her ability in the layup line. Then when the game started, she dominated from start to finish.\u201d\n\nBy the end of the summer, Frese offered Thomas a scholarship. Soon after that, other colleges \u2014 including Notre Dame, Penn State and Miami \u2014 joined the hunt.\n\n\u201cAlyssa didn\u2019t like all the attention,\u201d said her mother, Tina Klotzbeecher-Thomas, \u201cso she put an end to it by picking Maryland.\u201d\n\nThese days, Thomas can\u2019t avoid being noticed. A 6-foot-2 senior, she averages 18.7 points and 10.8 rebounds a game for the ninth-ranked Terrapins and leads the N.C.A.A. with 22 double-doubles. With four triple-doubles this season, she is one of only four players in N.C.A.A. history with at least six in her career.\n\nThomas is 33 points short of Crystal Langhorne\u2019s team record of 2,247, and 74 rebounds from tying Langhorne (1,229) for career leadership in that category. If those notable countdowns were not enough to make the shy Thomas a bit uncomfortable, she will have her No. 25 jersey hung from the rafters Sunday before her final regular-season game on Maryland\u2019s home court.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still hard to believe,\u201d said Thomas, a two-time Atlantic Coast Conference player of the year. \u201cWhen you first come to Maryland, you look up there and see all the big names of people that have made a legacy here. To think you\u2019re going to be up there now, words just can\u2019t describe the feeling.\u201d\n\nThomas will be the ninth female Terrapin player honored in such fashion.\n\n\u201cBy far, she\u2019s one of the best of the best,\u201d Frese said. \u201cFrom the moment A. T. stepped on campus and was given the nickname Baby Bron Bron by the men\u2019s basketball team \u2014 a mini LeBron \u2014 she\u2019s backed it up.\u201d\n\nBut Thomas was far more interested in excelling at soccer before her mother thrust a basketball into her hand when Alyssa was a third-grader.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t ask her; I just did it,\u201d said Klotzbeecher-Thomas, a former college forward.\n\nThomas quickly embraced the sport and honed her skills by playing one-on-one in the driveway against her brother, Devin, who now starts for Wake Forest.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s where my physicality comes from,\u201d Alyssa said.\n\nAt Maryland, she is more than just a force under the basket. In a recent game against Florida State, Thomas had a career-high 12 assists, along with 22 points and 12 rebounds, in an 87-77 victory.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s good with the ball; she\u2019s good without the ball,\u201d Seminoles Coach Sue Semrau said. \u201cShe\u2019s good on the inside; she\u2019s good on the outside. A kid that can be powerful inside and pass like that is just a special, special player.\u201d\n\nThomas is far more vocal now than when she first arrived at Maryland, mostly when it comes to pushing her teammates to win.\n\n\u201cOn the court you see how commanding she is \u2014 just ferocious and competitive,\u201d Frese said. \u201cOff the court, she\u2019s really quiet and soft-spoken, really humble. Just a phenomenal teammate. It\u2019s been neat to see her grow as a leader.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe year before Thomas arrived, Maryland was 21-13. Over the next three seasons the Terrapins went 24-8, 31-5 and 26-8. This season they are 23-5.\n\nThe highlight for Thomas so far was winning the 2012 A.C.C. tournament in North Carolina. While her teammates celebrated the improbable final victory near the bench, Thomas thanked every member of the Maryland band for making the trip.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been so proud,\u201d her mother said.\n\nThomas still has hopes of securing another A.C.C. title and making one final run at the N.C.A.A. championship before heading to the W.N.B.A. No matter how her final college season turns out, she will be forever grateful for the events that followed Frese\u2019s trip to Baltimore.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really happy with the decision to come here,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cThey were one of the schools that pursued me before other people found out about how I could play. It just felt like home. I knew it was the right school for me.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140301193106, "twitter": {"description": "Alyssa Thomas, who has led the Terrapins for four years, has a chance to end the season as their career record-holder in scoring and rebounding.", "title": "Milestones Await Alyssa Thomas, Maryland\u2019s Shy Star", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/02/sports/ncaabasketball/milestones-await-alyssa-thomas-marylands-shy-star.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002742913"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/02/sports/02MARYLAND/02MARYLAND-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/02/sports/ncaabasketball/milestones-await-alyssa-thomas-marylands-shy-star.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002742913", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/02/sports/ncaabasketball/milestones-await-alyssa-thomas-marylands-shy-star.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "sports/ncaabasketball", "hdl_p": "Milestones Await Maryland\u2019s Shy Star", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/sports/ncaabasketball/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "March 1, 2014", "edt": "National", "org": "University of Maryland", "keywords": "Basketball (College),University of Maryland,Frese  Brenda", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "The Associated Press", "SCG": "ncaabasketball", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Frese, Brenda", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Alyssa Thomas, who has led the Terrapins for four years, has a chance to end the season as their career record-holder in scoring and rebounding.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/02/sports/02MARYLAND/02MARYLAND-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "Alyssa Thomas, who has led the Terrapins for four years, has a chance to end the season as their career record-holder in scoring and rebounding.", "CG": "sports", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "March 1, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"section": "College Basketball", "modified": "2014-03-01", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/sports/ncaabasketball/index.jsonp", "tag": "Frese, Brenda", "published": "2014-03-01", "section-taxonomy-id": "DE2B278B-2783-4506-AAD5-C15A5BB6DA1A"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "slug": "02maryland", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20140301193106, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/02/sports/ncaabasketball/milestones-await-alyssa-thomas-marylands-shy-star.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/02/sports/02MARYLAND/02MARYLAND-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Alyssa Thomas, who has led the Terrapins for four years, has a chance to end the season as their career record-holder in scoring and rebounding.", "title": "Milestones Await Alyssa Thomas, Maryland\u2019s Shy Star"}, "pdate": 20140301, "des": "Basketball (College)", "articleid": 100000002742913, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Milestones Await Alyssa Thomas, Maryland\u2019s Shy Star", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/02/sports/02MARYLAND/02MARYLAND-thumbLarge.jpg", "PST": "News"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9727\"", "article_summary": "\u201cShe\u2019s good with the ball; she\u2019s good without the ball,\u201d Seminoles Coach Sue Semrau said.\n\u201cShe\u2019s good on the inside; she\u2019s good on the outside.\n\u201cBy far, she\u2019s one of the best of the best,\u201d Frese said.\nThen when the game started, she dominated from start to finish.\u201dBy the end of the summer, Frese offered Thomas a scholarship.\nIf those notable countdowns were not enough to make the shy Thomas a bit uncomfortable, she will have her No."}
