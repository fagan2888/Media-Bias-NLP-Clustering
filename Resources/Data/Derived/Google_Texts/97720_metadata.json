Sales and earnings both grew in the past year. And given that both Walgreen and Rite Aid (NYSE:RAD) have indicated that health-care reform is supporting prescription volume, investors may want to consider using stock weakness to buy pharmacies this summer.\n\nSales continue higher\n\nWalgreen's total sales grew by nearly 6% in the quarter from the same period last year. Sales growth was supported by a 2.2% lift in front-end same-store sales and a 6.3% jump in same-store pharmacy revenue. That's impressive given that the dollar value of branded drugs losing patent protection is higher this year than it was this time last year.\n\nOffsetting generic price headwinds, sales grew thanks in part to insurance enrollment increases driven by the Affordable Care Act.\n\nNewly insured patients covered by private plans and Medicaid expansion increased the number of prescriptions Walgreen filled last quarter by 4.1%, year over year. That outpaced the 2.3% script growth reported by Rite Aid during the three months ending in May.\n\nBig and getting bigger\n\nWalgreen is the goliath in the pharmacy market. The company opened or acquired a net 39 stores in the quarter, bringing its location count to 8,683 and solidifying its lead as the nation's largest pharmacy operator.\n\nThe store growth and solid results in prescription volume at existing stores helped Walgreen boost its market share by 20 basis points in the quarter, to 19%, according to IMS Health.\n\nPrescriptions for patients covered by Medicare Part D jumped more than 11% year over year in the quarter. Given that the number of prescriptions filled annually increases with age, and baby boomers are turning 65 at a rate of 10,000 per day, volume should continue to provide tailwinds over the coming years.\n\nImpacting the bottom line\n\nSimilar to Rite Aid, Walgreen blamed its earnings miss partially on lower reimbursements for generic drugs and generic-drug price increases.\n\nAs a result, the company's year-over-year cost of sales in the quarter increased by 40 basis points, to 71.9%. That uptick masked the company's cost savings success, which helped reduce selling, general, and administrative expenses from 23.8% of sales a year ago to 23.5%.\n\nDespite higher costs of sales, Walgreen in the quarter generated shareholder-friendly operating cash flow of $1.3 billion.\n\nThat consistent cash flow is helping Walgreen continue to invest in growth. The company is renovating stores to its new \"Well Experience\" format, opening in-store clinics, and rolling out new private label products such as Boots No7.\n\nThose investments should help future earnings grow, suggesting that while Walgreen earnings were light this quarter, headwinds may ease considerably over the coming year.\n\nThat could be particularly true given that Walgreen expects to make an investor presentation this summer regarding income-friendly moves tied to its link-up with Alliance Boots. That deal is already providing a better than predicted impact on Walgreen's bottom line, adding $0.15 to earnings per share this past quarter.\n\nFool-worthy final thoughts\n\nIf those reasons aren't intriguing enough to put Walgreen on your watchlist, the company is also improving its balance sheet. In the past year, Walgreen has reduced its long-term debt from $4.5 billion to $3.7 billion. If Walgreen can continue to grow its sales, and generic headwinds on profit ease, a better balance sheet may allow the company to boost its dividend, which makes this investment even more compelling.", "article_metadata": {"publish_time": "17:15", "description": "Walgreen may have missed on earnings this quarter, but over the long term it continues to look intriguing.", "ResponsiveALP": "1Ses_2things-v-single_2-things_50", "author": "Todd Campbell", "promo": "Walgreen may have missed on earnings this quarter, but over the long term it continues to look intriguing.", "twitter": {"title": "Here's What's Driving Results at Walgreen --  The Motley Fool", "description": "Walgreen may have missed on earnings this quarter, but over the long term it continues to look intriguing.", "site": "@themotleyfool"}, "msvalidate.01": "8D40D58712924715BAA79D135A6C8DDA", "og": {"site_name": "The Motley Fool", "description": "Walgreen may have missed on earnings this quarter, but over the long term it continues to look intriguing.", "title": "Here's What's Driving Results at Walgreen --  The Motley Fool", "url": "http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2014/06/24/heres-whats-driving-results-at-walgreen.aspx", "image": "https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F133712%2Fwag3.JPG&h=630&w=1200&op=resize", "type": "article"}, "headline": "Here's What's Driving Results at Walgreen", "fb": {"admins": 50808187550, "page_id": 7240312795, "app_id": 50808187550}, "bureau": "usmf-health-care", "STORY_UID": "0bf17dae-fbb4-11e3-98d8-0050569d4be0", "pitch": 787, "date": "2014-06-24T21:15:00Z", "gsa_date": "2014 06 24", "tickers": "WBA,RAD", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8ba0\"", "article_summary": "Sales continue higherWalgreen's total sales grew by nearly 6% in the quarter from the same period last year.\nSales growth was supported by a 2.2% lift in front-end same-store sales and a 6.3% jump in same-store pharmacy revenue.\nDespite higher costs of sales, Walgreen in the quarter generated shareholder-friendly operating cash flow of $1.3 billion.\nThose investments should help future earnings grow, suggesting that while Walgreen earnings were light this quarter, headwinds may ease considerably over the coming year.\nThat consistent cash flow is helping Walgreen continue to invest in growth."}
