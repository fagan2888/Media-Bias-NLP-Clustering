Roughly 90 percent of all diabetes cases are type 2, characterized by a deficiency in the pancreas to produce the hormone insulin, which regulates blood glucose levels. But type 1\u2019s remaining market share of 10 percent is actually far more lethal than type 2, as type 1 diabetics don\u2019t simply have an insulin deficiency, which can be controlled through diet and exercise, but a total lack of insulin production.\n\nBoth forms demand the regulation of blood glucose levels, but the consequences of ignoring that demand are far more severe in type 1 patients. For years, this has motivated researchers to develop effective treatment options that jumpstart the production of insulin. They\u2019ve known, for instance, that halted production of insulin was a result of destroyed \u00df-cells, which also live in the pancreas and typically disappear during childhood. (Type 1 diabetes is often referred to as juvenile diabetes.) While diabetics can stay healthy with regular insulin injections, the ideal solution would be to replace the missing \u00df-cells \u2014 something scientists don\u2019t yet have the tools to do, but, with the current study, is on the horizon.\n\n\"The power of regenerative medicine is that it can potentially provide an unlimited source of functional, insulin-producing \u00df-cells that can then be transplanted into the patient,\" said Gladstone Institute researcher and professor at the University of California San Francisco, Dr. Sheng Ding, in a statement. One the obstacles, however, is that mature \u00df-cells aren\u2019t easily replicated. So the team approached the cell from one stage earlier.\n\nUsing mouse models to conduct their study, the team extracted batches of skin cells, known as fibroblasts. Then, by treating the fibroblasts with a specific blend of molecules and reprogramming agents, they transformed the fibroblasts into cells found in the early embryo, known as endoderm cells. These cells eventually mature into the body\u2019s organs, including the pancreas. A third transformation yielded pancreas-like cells, which the team called PPLCs.\n\n\"Our initial goal was to see whether we could coax these PPLCs to mature into cells that, like \u00df-cells, respond to the correct chemical signals and \u2014 most importantly \u2014 secrete insulin,\u201d explained Gladstone researcher Dr. Ke Li. \u201cAnd our initial experiments, performed in a petri dish, revealed that they did.\u201d Subsequent live animal models showed the same success for mice with induced hyperglycemia (high blood sugar). And when the team removed the cells, glucose levels immediately spiked, \u201crevealing a direct link between the transplantation of the PPLC's and reduced hyperglycemia.\"\n\nBut perhaps the hallmark of the study was the eight-week check-in. Researchers found that mice in the experimental group had begun producing insulin-secreting \u00df-cells independently. Such results offer hope to scientists who one day seek to test the technique on human models. In the meantime, the team plans on further investigating the link between a lack of \u00df-cells and the eventual tip toward full-blown diabetes.\n\n\"These results not only highlight the power of small molecules in cellular reprogramming,\u201d Ding said. \u201cThey are proof-of-principle that could one day be used as a personalized therapeutic approach in patients.\u201d\n\nSource: Li K, Zhu S, Russ H, et al.
