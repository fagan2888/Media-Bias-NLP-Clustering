The reason given by the paper is \u201cthe kind of person who should be running is not in the race.\u201d\n\nThe editorial board dismisses Donald Trump as the choice for angry voters but notes he has been on both sides of major issues and is \u201ctoo bendable\u201d on core values.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nThey see Marco Rubio as the one most likely to unite Republicans and win, but also as someone lacking in experience and work ethic. Oddly, they also assert his conservative views are \u201cthose of yesteryear.\u201d\n\nAs for Ted Cruz, they bash him for his lack of compromise and see him as someone who might defer to the Bible when making decisions. \u201cCruz scares us,\u201d they say. Why, he\u2019d be willing to \u2014 horrors! \u2014 risk a government shutdown to kill Obamacare. He also promises to replace the IRS with a tiny office in the Treasury Department that will process tax returns submitted on postcards.\n\nBy the way, both of those sound like pretty good ideas to me. I still wish we could institute the Fair Tax and get rid of the IRS entirely. But then, I don\u2019t suppose the Sun Sentinel would have endorsed me, either.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nJohn Kasich they like well enough, but they say he lacks \u201cpresence\u201d and can\u2019t win with the Republican base, so they dismiss even him.\n\nOK, so no Republican merits an endorsement from the Sun Sentinel in 2016. Let\u2019s look on the Democratic side, where a socialist is running against a confirmed liar facing possible criminal indictments.\n\nAfter trashing the Republicans and failing to endorse anyone, surely they wouldn\u2019t find a Democrat worthy of their stamp of approval.\n\nWrong. They\u2019ve endorsed Hillary Clinton.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nOh, yes, they allow that she\u2019s \u201ctoo secretive, almost paranoid.\u201d They touch on her controversies and the investigations within the State Department and the Department of Justice, and they mention her failure to release the content of her Wall Street speeches.\n\nBut it seems they\u2019re willing to forgive her disingenuous nature and Nixonian paranoia and her dangerous flouting of the law regarding classified material. She\u2019s \u201cflawed, but qualified,\u201d \u201csteady and experienced.\u201d \u201cShe won\u2019t need training wheels.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s for sure. She\u2019s more than ready to get into office and play by her own rules. But then, this same paper also endorsed Obama in 2008, despite him having no executive experience whatsoever, questionable associates, failed far-left views from yesteryear, half as much time in the Senate as Rubio, and a virtually non-existent legislative record.\n\nThe Sun Sentinel has implied what we already know \u2014 when it comes to Democrats, the standards are much, much lower.\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by the owners of this website.", "article_metadata": {"description": "...so no Republican merits ...", "author": "Mike Huckabee", "og": {"site_name": "Western Journalism", "description": "...so no Republican merits ...", "title": "Major Newspaper Does THIS For First Time In Its History- May Impact Election In Key Swing State", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 914, "identifier": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/clinton-sanders-debate.jpg", "height": 483}, "updated_time": "2016-03-14T08:29:04-07:00", "url": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/major-newspaper-does-this-for-first-time-in-its-history-may-impact-election-in-key-swing-state/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "...so no Republican merits ...", "creator": "@WestJournalism", "image": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/clinton-sanders-debate.jpg", "title": "Major Newspaper Does THIS For First Time In Its History- May Impact Election In Key Swing State", "site": "@WestJournalism", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "DC.date.issued": "2016-03-12T11:19:53-07:00", "fb": {"app_id": 275784739127435, "pages": 123624513983}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/android-chrome-192x192.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WesternJournalism", "section": "Opinion", "tag": "Mike Huckabee", "published_time": "2016-03-12T11:19:53-07:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-14T08:29:04-07:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "republican presidential candidates, democrat presidential candidates, 2016 election, mike huckabee, politics, nation, religion"}, "article_summary": "The Sun Sentinel has implied what we already know \u2014 when it comes to Democrats, the standards are much, much lower.\nIt\u2019s the first time in its history the paper has refused to give a presidential endorsement.\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues belowThey see Marco Rubio as the one most likely to unite Republicans and win, but also as someone lacking in experience and work ethic.\nAdvertisement - story continues belowThe South Florida Sun Sentinel newspaper has itself made news by refusing to endorse any of the four remaining Republicans for Tuesday\u2019s Florida presidential primary.\nAfter trashing the Republicans and failing to endorse anyone, surely they wouldn\u2019t find a Democrat worthy of their stamp of approval."}
