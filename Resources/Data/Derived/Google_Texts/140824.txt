BOULDER – University of Colorado men’s basketball head coach Tad Boyle announced Sunday that Derrick White has transferred from Division II University of Colorado-Colorado Springs and has signed a financial aid agreement to play with the Buffaloes.

Per NCAA transfer rules, White, a 6-5, 180-pound guard and a three-year standout at UCCS, will sit out the 2015-16 season and have one year of eligibility remaining.

“Derrick’s a versatile Division II All-American,” Boyle said. “He was a kid overlooked by virtually everybody, obviously except the University of Colorado-Colorado Springs, coming out of high school. He’s got great size, great athleticism, and he has great skill. When you see a guy that’s an All-American, and has proven everything that he can prove at the Division II level, it’s exciting to bring a player like that who can score, rebound, and pass into your program.”

White was named to the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC) All-America Team during his junior season, when he averaged 25.8 points, 7.4 rebounds, 5.2 assists per game. He helped the Mountain Lions to their first Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference Tournament Championship and to the second round of the 2015 NCAA Division II National Tournament. UCCS finished the 2014-15 season with a program-best 27-6 record.

Boyle called White “a terrific player with a great upside. I look at the last guy that we brought in, that had to sit one year and play one year, his name is Carlon Brown (Pac-12 Conference Tournament's Most Outstanding Player in 2012). Carlon had a pretty good experience and I’m hoping Derrick can do the same.”

White, who started every game he played in (87) at UCCS, holds the school career scoring (1,912 points) and assists (343) records. During his sophomore and junior seasons, he helped the Mountain Lions to a 48-15 overall record (.762) and a 33-11 RMAC mark (.750). He reached 11 assists in a game – a school record – three times in 2014-15 and recorded 15 career double-doubles.

White will be the seventh player to transfer to the CU men’s basketball program under Boyle.
