He marked off George W. Bush\u2019s win in the Texas governor\u2019s race.\n\nCAMBRIDGE \u2014 As the lights rose, Ted Cruz held center stage, dressed in black and kneeling at a bedside. The first-year student at Harvard Law School delivered his lines with the emotions of a man gripped by anger, fear, and worry for his reputation.\n\n\u201cDo you understand that I have many enemies?\u201d he thundered. \u201cThere is a faction that is sworn to drive me from my pulpit. Do you understand that?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCruz, then a devoted amateur thespian, was playing the role of the Rev. Samuel Parris in \u201cThe Crucible,\u201d Arthur Miller\u2019s allegorical play about McCarthyism.\n\nThe lines \u2014 and the part \u2014 seem prophetic today.\n\nIn the US Senate, the Tea Party Republican from Texas has continued to seek out a spot at center stage. His enemies \u2014 and he has many, including some in his own party \u2014 characterize him as power-hungry, self-righteous, driven by single-minded political piety. He even mounted what detractors called a groundless witch hunt, against the presidential nominee for secretary of defense.\n\nNone of which, to his former Harvard Law classmates, is surprising.\n\nInterviews with more than two dozen alumnae and professors fill in a portrait of Cruz, in Cambridge two decades ago, that would be fully recognizable to those who know him now in Washington. He made a lasting impression as someone both arrogant and pretentious, as well as someone unwilling to yield or compromise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut he was also universally respected for his intellect, described by friend and foe alike as brilliant but with a hard edge.\n\n\u201cHe never really had an off switch with his debater\u2019s demeanor,\u201d said Ted Ruger, who was president of the Harvard Law Review during Cruz\u2019s third year. \u201cWe just realized that was the way a discussion with Ted was going to go. If you expected something different, you came away shaking your head.\u201d\n\nSome two decades later, Cruz has deftly tapped into a rebellious, angry strain in American conservatism and emerged as a leader in the Tea Party movement. He was a primary force behind last month\u2019s government shutdown, and has been mentioned as a possible 2016 presidential candidate.\n\nThe man who prodded his colleagues on the Harvard Law Review is now the one drawing the ire of his Senate colleagues. He remains more notorious than popular.\n\nLooking back, Cruz said those three years at Harvard Law School, from 1992 to 1995, sharpened his political vision and trained him for the intense sparring with liberals that has become his signature style as a national politician.\n\nBut he also said he has mellowed since then.\n\n\u201cI suspect I was not the first 21-year-old who thought he knew more than he did,\u2019\u2019 Cruz said in an interview in his Senate office. \u201cAnd one of the virtues of age, one of the virtues of getting married and becoming a father, is it often leads one to take a more measured approach to life.\u201d\n\nBorn in Canada\n\nTed Cruz arrived in Cambridge as an outsider.\n\nHe was born in Alberta, Canada. His father fled persecution in Cuba, eventually settling in Austin, Texas, where he learned English and earned a college degree.\n\nAfter growing up in the Houston area, Cruz studied public policy at Princeton, where he developed a reputation as a quick-witted national debate champion. His near-perfect score on the LSAT helped him fulfill a dream of going to Harvard Law School.\n\nIt was a long way from Texas. Cruz\u2019s father called it \u201cmissionary work,\u201d a place that would allow his conservative son to preach to the liberal elite. And Cruz\u2019s strident views stood out as much as the cowboy boots he wore to class, or the large Texas flag in his dorm room.\n\n\u201cGoing to school on a campus where the faculty overwhelmingly disagrees with you, and where the student body overwhelmingly disagrees with you, is challenging,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cIf you go in without a firm foundation, it can undermine what you believe.\u201d\n\nCruz enrolled in 1992, a year after President Obama left and just as Elizabeth Warren began teaching as a visiting professor (she never taught him). He immediately stood out academically, even in a class of 560 of the country\u2019s brightest students.\n\n\u201cHe came in with his right hand raised and basically kept it raised the entire semester,\u201d said Alan Dershowitz, who taught Cruz in a first-year criminal law class. \u201cEvery year you see two or three students who you know are natural leaders. Everybody saw that with Barack Obama . . . Everybody saw that with Elena Kagan. There are students who come in with charismatic qualities who other people follow. He was one of them.\u201d\n\nWhile talkative and outgoing, he struck some classmates as nakedly ambitious.\n\nAs they were entering their second year in law school, Melissa Hart agreed to give Cruz a ride from New York, where Cruz was at the end of the summer, back to Cambridge. She didn\u2019t know him well, but he sought her out after she had been given a prestigious award for first-year students.\n\n\u201cWe hadn\u2019t left Manhattan before he asked my IQ,\u201d Hart said. \u201cWhen I told him I didn\u2019t know, he asked, \u2018Well, what\u2019s your SAT score? That\u2019s closely coordinated with your IQ.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cIt went from, \u2018Nice guy,\u2019 \u201d she said, \u201cto \u2018uh-oh.\u2019 \u201d\n\nA former roommate told the magazine GQ recently that Cruz preferred to study only with graduates of Harvard, Princeton, or Yale, dismissing the rest as \u201cthe minor Ivies.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s complete nonsense,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cIt\u2019s simply not true.\u201d\n\nThe five-member study group included one member, Jeff Hinck, who attended Northwestern.\n\nLaw Review post\n\nCruz lived in Hastings Hall, a six-story brownstone behind wrought-iron gates. The Hemenway Gymnasium, where he played intramural basketball and volleyball, was 40 steps away; Gannett House, which housed the Harvard Law Review, was 70 more.\n\nOccasionally he would venture into Harvard Square for Mexican food or a movie. He avoided Boston, although one classmate recalls Cruz being the only one willing to shell out money to see Michael Jordan in the Boston Garden in his second game back from his brief baseball career (Cruz can still recount the box score).\n\nIn his second year, Cruz joined the Law Review and became a principal editor. He was also a founding editor of the Harvard Latino Law Review (where he is listed as \u201cRafael E. Cruz\u201d) and joined the conservative Harvard Journal of Law and Public Policy (\u201cR. Ted Cruz\u201d).\n\nCruz focused primarily on his studies, and the law journals. But he stayed up late playing marathon sessions of \u201cSuper Mario Brothers\u201d on the Nintendo, or cards. If the game was hearts, his signature move was to \u201cshoot the moon,\u201d the game\u2019s riskiest, showiest, and most aggressive maneuver.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to execute,\u201d said Charles Morse, a law school friend. \u201cTed was fond of that.\u201d\n\nIf the game was poker, he put all his chips on the table.\n\n\u201cHe would go all in sometimes . . . and you\u2019d never know if he\u2019s bluffing,\u201d said Alexander Acosta, another friend. \u201cHe\u2019s someone who\u2019s willing to take risks.\u201d\n\nHe also enjoyed antagonizing liberal classmates. Late nights at the Law Review were the scene of fierce debates. Cruz\u2019s beliefs are no different now, and when it came to taxation classmates recall him arguing that the government was stealing money from the rich and giving it to the poor.\n\n\u201cSome topic would come up and it was a free for all,\u201d said Dean Newton, a fellow conservative on the Law Review. \u201cAll you\u2019d have to do is say something remotely conservative and it would catch people\u2019s hair on fire. It was fun to goad them.\u201d\n\nPoking at turtles\n\nNewton compared the sparring he and Cruz would engage in with Harvard liberals to poking at snapping turtles stuck at the bottom of a barrel.\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t take much of a stick,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they would immediately snap.\u201d\n\nBut with Cruz, those arguments became heated. It wasn\u2019t just the substance, but how Cruz presented his case. To his adversaries, he was relentless. To his allies, he was misunderstood.\n\n\u201cSome people think his language is hard,\u201d said David Panton, Cruz\u2019s longtime best friend, and his roommate their first year at Harvard Law School.\u201cBut he\u2019s a litigator. He has strong views and he makes his points clearly and empathically.\u201d\n\nTed Cruz was, and in many ways still is, an actor.\n\nIn high school, he says, he considered dropping out and moving to California to pursue an acting career. His parents talked him out of it.\n\nShortly after he got to Harvard, he auditioned for \u201cThe Crucible,\u201d which the law school drama society was staging to mark the 300th anniversary of the Salem witch trials.\n\nMiller\u2019s play was written during Senator Joseph Mc-\n\nCarthy\u2019s Communist witch hunt in the 1950s. Since becoming a senator, Cruz\u2019s critics have likened him to McCarthy for suggesting, without evidence, that Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel might have accepted money from extreme or radical groups. The comment drew a rebuke from Senator John McCain, who later called Cruz a \u201cwacko bird.\u201d\n\nCruz rejects comparisons of himself to McCarthy, suggesting he is the one being judged.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tremendous play,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it is obviously a lesson against jumping to conclusions and being unfairly and harshly judgmental of others. That is a lesson I wish a lot more in Washington would take heed of.\u201d\n\nTo the play\u2019s cast members, \u201cThe Crucible\u201d is memorable for another reason.\n\nAfter the successful first performance, Cruz spent the cast party imbibing so much Everclear \u2014 a powerful grain alcohol \u2014 that he couldn\u2019t make it through the next night\u2019s performance. His fellow actors had to coax him into going onstage, but by Act III his condition worsened.\n\nA video of the performance shows him sitting on a bench onstage, his head buried in his hands for nearly five minutes straight. After meekly delivering a line, he walked off stage in the middle of the scene, forcing cast members to improvise around the departure of a lead character. He didn\u2019t return for the remainder of the play.\n\n\u201cI was not feeling well, which was unfortunate,\u201d Cruz said, taking a philosophical view of the experience. \u201cThe young are not renowned for their wisdom. And that\u2019s certainly not a principle from which I was exempt.\u201d\n\nAsked if he\u2019d had a sip of Everclear since, he replied, \u201cI doubt it.\u201d\n\nIt was a rare display of weakness for someone who otherwise seemed determined to succeed.\n\nFrom the moment Cruz stepped onto the Harvard campus, he was intent on winning a clerkship with Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist, a fast track to conservative legal prominence.\n\n\u201cFrom day one . . . that was his tangible, near-term goal,\u201d said Jeff Hinck, a study partner.\n\nCruz was so driven to secure a clerkship that he resolved to learn tennis, since Rehnquist, an avid player, was known to organize weekly matches with his clerks.\n\nWhen he finally got an audience with Rehnquist and was asked if he was willing to play, Cruz, while allowing that he was \u201cnot very good,\u201d eagerly agreed.\n\nHe got the job, but paid a price.\n\n\u201cWhat he didn\u2019t realize until later was that \u2018not very good\u2019 was an incredible boast,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cI was so horrifically bad at tennis.\u201d\n\nLooking beyond campus\n\nAt Harvard Law, Cruz was a member of a small band of conservatives whose politics were out of step with most of their peers. But beyond campus, conservatism was a gathering force.\n\nAs the 1994 elections approached, with Newt Gingrich leading the charge, Cruz and his friends threw a \u201cRepublicans Take Back the House Party,\u201d in Hastings Hall. When Republicans triumphed, the campus conservatives erupted in cheers \u2014 antagonizing Harvard\u2019s liberals with their raucous celebration.\n\n\u201cI walked in and there were people going crazy,\u201d said Matt Bodie, one of Cruz\u2019s liberal classmates. \u201cI said, \u2018Oh I gotta get out of here.\u2019 But there were some very happy conservatives.\u201d\n\nBy the time he left Cambridge, the right wing in American politics was ascendant and Cruz, with his newly minted Harvard Law degree, was one of its brightest young stars.\n\nShortly after graduating magna cum laude, he took out a loan and bought his mother a new Saab convertible for her birthday. Then he embarked on the series of prestigious clerkships that planted the seeds for his political career.\n\nInside his Senate office, on a shelf with some of his writings in Harvard law journals, he keeps a baseball cap that has the words \u201cWACKO BIRD\u201d on it, memorializing the term McCain gave him.\n\nAs Cruz leaned back in his chair, nursing a cold following a weekend trip testing the presidential waters in Iowa, he reflected on the lessons he took from Harvard Law School. And that man who has so roiled the Republican Party, and upset Washington for his demeanor and his tactics, said there needed to be more civility.\n\n\u201cThere is a depressing tendency in modern political life to disparage those who disagree with you as either stupid or evil,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2019They\u2019re either too dumb to know the right answer or, even worse, they\u2019re smart enough and yet they wish suffering on others and are just downright evil.\u2019 The truth of the matter, most people are neither.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "2.2.512419051", "eomportal-id": 46186, "description": "CAMBRIDE \u2014 Interviews with nearly two dozen of his former classmates and professors at Harvard Law School paint a recognizable portrait of Texas Senator Ted Cruz, whom they remember as pretentious and arrogant but also as \u201cvery, very, very smart.\u201d Cruz followed a combative, debate-focused style as he took on the foreign culture of a liberal campus, a place where his strident conservatism stuck out as much as the cowboy boots he wore to class.
