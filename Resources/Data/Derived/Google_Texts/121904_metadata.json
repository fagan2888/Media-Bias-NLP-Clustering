Eric Chan, CC BY 2.0\n\nSorry, Mom. If everyone I knew jumped off a bridge, science says I\u2019d be more likely to jump with them.\n\nNew research into how people judge risks and make decisions suggests we often turn to the people around us for information about what\u2019s right. That decision may be dangerous, such as putting all our money on black or doing hard drugs. But imagine the countless businesses that never would have made it off the ground had it not been for the founder\u2019s goading friend. Or consider the thousands of people who never would\u2019ve taken the leap of buying a gym membership, held back by insecurity, if not for the reassurance that everyone starts somewhere. Risks can be positive, too.\n\n\u201cWe've known for a long time that people are influenced by others,\u201d said George Christopoulos, assistant professor at Nanyang Business School in Singapore. The latest study takes the understanding a step further, putting subjects inside an fMRI scanner to measure brain activity as they made gambling decisions. Each participant had the choice between a guaranteed $5 win and a 50 percent chance of winning $10. In one condition, they made the decision independently. In the other, they made it after seeing what others had picked.\n\nUltimately, when people made the decision after seeing what other subjects had chosen, their own decision tended to follow suit. To the researchers, this suggested a \u201cbirds of a feather\u201d phenomenon: Despite the risks being mostly equal, participants saw added value \u2014 indeed, added safety \u2014 in others\u2019 decisions. As a result, they followed the group.\n\n\u201cNo one knows how the gambles will play out, but people still tend to conform with others,\u201d said Dongil Chung, the study\u2019s first author and research associate at the Virginia Tech Carilion Research Institute. \u201cThe likelihood that you will be nudged depends on how much you value what others say.\u201d\n\nIt isn\u2019t earth-shattering to argue people make decisions based on advice they trust, even if that advice is in the form of a decision or behavior. People lead by example, and we follow just as faithfully. What the study reveals, the team argues, is a more discreet system of value extraction that occurs when we make those choices. The fMRI scans showed activation in subjects\u2019 ventromedial prefrontal cortex, a brain region responsible for handling reward and values. Social proof doesn\u2019t just make us feel more comfortable with our choices; it leads us to see them as more meaningful.\n\nPearl Chiu, senior author on the paper and an assistant professor in psychology at Virginia Tech, says we can use this information to our advantage. Staying aware of our baseline aversion or draw to risk-taking, we can surround ourselves with people whose behavior moves us closer to our goals. We can keep friends that continually challenge our notions of safe, thereby getting us out of our comfort zones. And we can delete friendships that get us acting against our self-interest.\n\n\"Risk simply means the outcomes are uncertain, and some risks are healthy such as trying out for a sports team,\" Chiu told Medical Daily in an email. \"Our data show that social forces are motivating for both riskier and safer choices, and one way to encourage positive/healthy choices might be to surround yourself with others who are making similar choices to those you would like to make (e.g., exercising, eating more healthily, recycling).\"\n\nChung echoed the sentiment, emphasizing that \u201cwho you are is as important as who you are with.\u201d He does, however, add the caveat that taking cues from others still comes with its limits. I might jump off the bridge if there\u2019s a harness connecting my ankles to the bridge, but no amount of peer pressure could get me off the edge without one.\n\nSource: Chung D, et al.
