SPRINGFIELD – U.S. Rep. Richard E. Neal, D-Springfield, has remained bullish on the Affordable Care Act, undaunted by the controversy that has surrounded its roll-out and by polls that show significant public opposition.



Neal, during a visit to two health center programs in Springfield on Thursday, defended the act, saying the “status quo” for health care in the United States was not working, and the opposition to the new act has failed to offer any better solution.



Neal said the law will improve the longevity of the federal Medicare insurance program; will provide insurance to roughly 40 million more Americans who were not insured; provides a “heavy emphasis” on preventive care to help reduce health costs, and will “end the scourge” of people being denied insurance for pre-existing conditions.



“Half the bankruptcies in America were health care related,” Neal said. “You got sick, you lost your job, you lost everything. Not any longer.”



Opponents, including Republican legislators, have sharply criticized the program, many saying it has been confusing and cumbersome for the public; will result in substantial increases in fees and taxes to afford the program, and will be a burden on businesses and result in job losses. The registration of millions of Americans was marred with technological glitches and delays.

While the program has triggered opposition and controversy, Neal said Medicare was also met with strong opposition when first introduced in 1965, and is now embraced.



“Remember the roll-out of Medicare was rocky, very rocky,” Neal said.



The Affordable Care Act, also referred to as Obamacare, did have serious problems in its launch, Neal said.



“I think the president is correct — the roll-out of the Affordable Care Act has been inexcusable, particularly from a technological perspective,” Neal said. “But the technology side of it can be repaired. The problem is that the technological argument is overshadowing many of the good parts of the Affordable Care Act.”



There is “no question” that debate over the act is dwarfing many other issues before Congress and making it harder to address those other issues, Neal said.



“It will become in many parts of the country the sole focus of the opposition,” Neal said. “Of that, there is little doubt.”



Neal on Thursday visited Fallon Community Health Plan’s Summit ElderCare program on Wason Avenue, that opened last year, and also visited the Behavioral Health Center clinic at 417 Liberty St.



Polls by CNN and other organizations have indicated that the majority of Americans oppose the Affordable Care Act. Many fear their insurance costs will increase.



Under the act, health insurance coverage is mandatory, and needs to be, just as automobile insurance in Massachusetts is mandatory, Neal said. In each case, someone may not get sick or hurt, but the insurance is there because someone may get sick or hurt, he said.



The opposition has said that government should “repeal and replace” the Affordable Care Act, but there is no way you can eliminate the insurance mandate and keep the ban on pre-existing conditions, Neal said.



Asked if the program may hurt Obama’s legacy, Neal said the program will be debated “for a long period of time.”



During Neal’s tour of the Summit Eldercare program, Fallon administrators and staff pointed out myriad of programs for senior citizen participants including its All-inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE) program.



“I think in a lot of ways, this is the face of what health care is going to look like as we embark on the baby boom generation’s retirement,” Neal said. 
