Between August 12 and August 24 that number rose to 304. This table from Micah Zenko at the Council on Foreign Relations summarizes the data:\n\nThe lack of results can be attributed in part to ongoing negotiations between the U.S. and Turkey to sort out the nitty-gritty details of an \u201cair tasking order\u201d that puts any of Turkey\u2019s air missions against the terror group under the coalition\u2019s banner.\n\n\u201cIt could take a few days to put these technical arrangements into place at the operational level,\u201d Pentagon press secretary Peter Cook said earlier this week at a press briefing. \u201cWe believe that Turkey is committed to fully participating as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nRelated: Why Even Obama Doesn\u2019t Know If We\u2019re Winning the War Against ISIS\n\nThe news came just a few days after Defense Secretary Ash Carter said, \u201cwe do want Turkey to do more in the fight against ISIS.\u201d\n\nCook said the Pentagon\u2019s \u201ccooperation with the Turks, and the expansion of that cooperation, remains a work in progress at this point, and so we see this as a step forward, but we also see that there\u2019s opportunity for Turkey and the U.S. and the rest of the coalition to further refine exactly what that cooperation looks like going forward.\u201d\n\nAnother reason the arrangement has yet to pay off is that Turkey seems to be more interested in fighting Kurdish forces than ISIS. Ankara unleashed a large air campaign on Kurdish militants in Turkey and northern Iraq while the new military agreement with Washington was being hammered out.\n\nSome observers believe the campaign was just a taste of things to come, especially as Turkey\u2019s internal politics become more unstable ahead of an election this November.\n\nRelated: ISIS Fight, Iran Deal Sink Obama\u2019s Numbers\n\nEric Edelman, who served as the U.S. ambassador to Turkey from 2005 to 2009, wrote in a New York Times op-ed that the cost of the military agreement \u201cmay be too high in the long run\u201d because Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan will likely continue striking Kurdish targets to increase his party\u2019s standing in the polls.\n\n\u201cThis strategy might help Mr. Erdogan win an election, but it is severely undermining the fight against the Islamic State,\u201d he wrote, noting that Kurdish forces have enjoyed the most success in battling the extremist group.\n\nIf Ankara does not cease its aggression toward the Kurds, \u201cAmerica\u2019s deal with Turkey will prove to be a Faustian bargain,\u201d Edelman warned.\n\nHe argued that the administration should curb Turkey\u2019s access to coalition intelligence and limit financial support to the country in order to force a change in its behavior.\n\n\u201cGetting Turkish leaders to change course will be extremely difficult, but it is imperative to pressure them if Turkey is to avoid being sucked into the vortex created by a failed Syria policy and Mr. Erdogan\u2019s dogged quest for absolute political power,\u201d wrote Edelman.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The arrangement between Turkey and the U.S. to conduct airstrikes against ISIS has yet to pay many dividends.", "title": "Is Turkey More Interested in Fighting Kurds Than ISIS?", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/08/27/Turkey-More-Interested-Fighting-Kurds-ISIS", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/08272015_Turkish_Kurds.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/08/27/Turkey-More-Interested-Fighting-Kurds-ISIS", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/08272015_Turkish_Kurds.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "The arrangement between Turkey and the U.S. to conduct airstrikes against ISIS has yet to pay many dividends.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The arrangement between Turkey and the U.S. to conduct airstrikes against ISIS has yet to pay much in the way of dividends.\nFighter Jets Arrive in Turkey, Can Air Power Turn the Tide Against ISIS?\nIf Ankara does not cease its aggression toward the Kurds, \u201cAmerica\u2019s deal with Turkey will prove to be a Faustian bargain,\u201d Edelman warned.\nAnkara unleashed a large air campaign on Kurdish militants in Turkey and northern Iraq while the new military agreement with Washington was being hammered out.\nBetween July 30 and August 11, 293 airstrikes were carried out by U.S.-led coalition forces, according to official tallies."}
