At William Paterson University in Wayne, 300 of 2,700 beds are empty.\n\nThe vacancies started about three years ago and have grown, the report says. Some schools are still paying back the bonds used to build the new facilities.\n\nColleges like Ramapo have instead opted to turn turn triples into two-person rooms. William Paterson is considering razing or renovating its oldest dorms, the report said.\n\nMeanwhile universities like Rutgers and Montclair State have increased enrollment. College officials say dorms are still in demand there.\n\nHowever college officials at Ramapo and William Paterson argue that the downturn in demand is temporary.\n\n\"There's still a strong feeling that living on the college campus is a big part of the experience.
