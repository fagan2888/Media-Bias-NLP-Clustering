Now it has been revealed that not only the U.S. government, but the Israeli government too has near unfettered access to considerable amounts of communications data going out of the U.S.\n\nThe latest in the Guardian\u2019s barrage of revelations, based on a top-secret memorandum between the NSA and its Israeli counterpart and leaked by Edward Snowden, illustrates how the surveillance state stretches far beyond national borders. As Glenn Greenwald, Laura Poitras and Ewen McAskill reported Wednesday, the NSA \u2014 as regular practice \u2014 shares raw intelligence data with Israel without first sifting it to remove information about U.S. citizens. Via the Guardian:\n\nDetails of the intelligence-sharing agreement are laid out in a memorandum of understanding between the NSA and its Israeli counterpart that shows the US government handed over intercepted communications likely to contain phone calls and emails of American citizens. The agreement places no legally binding limits on the use of the data by the Israelis\u2026 The deal was reached in principle in March 2009, according to the undated memorandum, which lays out the ground rules for the intelligence sharing. The five-page memorandum, termed an agreement between the US and Israeli intelligence agencies \u201cpertaining to the protection of US persons\u201d, repeatedly stresses the constitutional rights of Americans to privacy and the need for Israeli intelligence staff to respect these rights. But this is undermined by the disclosure that Israel is allowed to receive \u201craw Sigint\u201d \u2013 signal intelligence. The memorandum says: \u201cRaw Sigint includes, but is not limited to, unevaluated and unminimized transcripts, gists, facsimiles, telex, voice and Digital Network Intelligence metadata and content.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Documents show U.S. special relationship with Israel includes passing information on U.S. citizens' communications", "title": "Israel\u2019s unfettered access to NSA data", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Documents show U.S. special relationship with Israel includes passing information on U.S. citizens' communications", "title": "Israel\u2019s unfettered access to NSA data", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/09/11/israels_unfettered_access_to_nsa_data/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/09/shutterstock_131500409.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Documents show U.S. special relationship with Israel includes passing information on U.S. citizens' communications", "title": "Israel\u2019s unfettered access to NSA data", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/09/shutterstock_131500409.jpg", "creator": "@natashalennard", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Natasha Lennard", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, data, Edward Snowden, fourth amendment, Glenn Greenwald, Israel, metadata, Middle East, National Security Agency, NSA, Privacy, Spying, Surveillance, The Guardian, Warrantless", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd943a\"", "article_summary": "Now it has been revealed that not only the U.S. government, but the Israeli government too has near unfettered access to considerable amounts of communications data going out of the U.S.\nAs Glenn Greenwald, Laura Poitras and Ewen McAskill reported Wednesday, the NSA \u2014 as regular practice \u2014 shares raw intelligence data with Israel without first sifting it to remove information about U.S. citizens.\nThe five-page memorandum, termed an agreement between the US and Israeli intelligence agencies \u201cpertaining to the protection of US persons\u201d, repeatedly stresses the constitutional rights of Americans to privacy and the need for Israeli intelligence staff to respect these rights.\nBut this is undermined by the disclosure that Israel is allowed to receive \u201craw Sigint\u201d \u2013 signal intelligence.\nThe memorandum says: \u201cRaw Sigint includes, but is not limited to, unevaluated and unminimized transcripts, gists, facsimiles, telex, voice and Digital Network Intelligence metadata and content.\u201d"}
