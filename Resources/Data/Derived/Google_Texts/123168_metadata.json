But it's so easy for us to close our eyes and not look at the videos of Planned Parenthood, because it's too hard for us to stomach.\"\n\n\u201cFor me, this is outside my comfort zone,\u201d Campbell explains after the minivan drives off. \u201cI\u2019m not a person that likes conflict or confrontation. But this is something I\u2019m super passionate about. It\u2019s so easy for us to\u2026close our eyes and not look at the videos of Planned Parenthood, because it\u2019s too hard for us to stomach.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s been more than one shouting match between drivers and the 200 or so protesters lined up outside one Planned Parenthood in Ann Arbor.\n\n\u201cF\u2014k you, you piece of s\u2014t,\u201d one young guy in a University of Michigan hat yells to a man holding the same sign as Campbell.\n\n\u201cYou should thank your mom because she chose life!\u201d the protester responds.\n\nBut every few minutes, another car honks as driver waves in support of the protesters.\n\nThis rally is one of a dozen similar protests planned at Planned Parenthood clinics around the state.\n\nIt\u2019s part of a national day of protests sponsored by groups like the Pro-Life Society and co-sponsored by a long list of organizations, including the Family Research Council, Survivors of the Abortion Holocaust, and a group called This Race Will Self-Destruct \u2013 which, according to its website, seeks to \u201ceducate\u2026about the Abortion and HIV/AIDS crises that are devastating the African American Community.\u201d\n\nBuilding momentum after controversial Planned Parenthood videos\n\nThe protests are meant to capitalize on the controversy surrounding secretly-filmed, highly-edited videos released this summer, which show Planned Parenthood executives discussing graphic details about how some clinics donate fetal tissue to medical research \u2013 how they know which abortions will yield the best chance of delivering intact fetal tissue, etc.\n\nThe videos were created by a group called the Center for Medical Progress, whose members pretended to be from companies interested in acquiring fetal tissue.\n\nFor Bethany Campbell, the young woman who says she\u2019s worked as a nurse out of state before moving back to Saline, the videos have been deeply disturbing \u2013 especially one released just this past week, which purports to be an interview with a young woman who previously worked as technician at Stem Express, LLC.\n\nStem Express LLC reportedly used to have a contract with Planned Parenthood to process fetal tissue before sending it to medical researchers. But recent reports say the company has severed ties with Planned Parenthood after the videos were released.\n\nIn the most recent video, the woman who says she worked as a technician at Stem Express LLC talks about receiving a fully intact fetus whose heart started beating.\n\nFor Campbell, that was heartbreaking.\n\n\u201cJust with the videos coming out, it\u2019s so appalling \u2026 to see what they\u2019re doing to live babies. It really made me want to stand up to defund Planned Parenthood, because I don\u2019t want my tax dollars going to this. I just really feel like I need to stand up, because who else is?\u201d\n\nActually, most of the other protesters who spoke with Michigan Radio at this Ann Arbor rally said this is hardly the first time they\u2019ve come out to protest Planned Parenthood.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve come and prayed in front of the clinic before,\u201d says Kate Schoenle of Plymouth, who brought her kids along on Saturday. She says they range in age from five to 18.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t view it as political,\u201d she says. \u201cWe see it as an extension of our faith, and being disciples of Christ. So it\u2019s important to do that in every aspect of our life, keeping that integrity in every part of our life no matter what the issue is.\u201d\n\nPlanned Parenthood\u2019s response\n\nAs some Republicans in both Lansing and Washington D.C. continue to call for pulling tax payer dollars from Planned Parenthood, many in the organization say they\u2019re working hard to set the record straight.\n\n\"For the vast majority of our patients, this is the [only] healthcare they get a year. Our statistics show that it's nearly 80% of our patients who only get healthcare from us.\"\n\nPlanned Parenthood says their fetal tissue donation practices are completely lawful, because they follow guidelines requiring the consent of the mother \u2013 and that they don\u2019t make a profit from the donations; they just get reimbursed for some of their costs.\n\nLori Carpentier is the President and CEO of Planned Parenthood Advocates of Michigan.\n\nShe says none of their clinics in Michigan currently donate fetal tissue to researchers, although she says they\u2019d be open to it.\n\nMeanwhile, she says they\u2019re providing critical services \u2013 including cancer screenings, long term birth control, and prenatal care \u2013 to 72,000 Michigan women each year.\n\n\u201cFor the vast majority of our patients, this is the [only] healthcare they get a year,\u201d says Carpentier. \u201cOur statistics show that it\u2019s nearly 80% of our patients who only get healthcare from us.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"category": "News", "description": "A woman in a minivan is not at all happy with Bethany Campbell\u2019s massive poster, which shows the bloody detached head of a fetus and reads \u201cChoice is", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://michiganradio.org/post/protesters-rally-planned-parenthoods-citing-controversial-videos", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/michigan/files/styles/medium/public/201508/protests_1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A woman in a minivan is not at all happy with Bethany Campbell\u2019s massive poster, which shows the bloody detached head of a fetus and reads \u201cChoice is", "title": "Protesters rally at Planned Parenthoods, citing controversial videos"}, "story_id": 433800287, "twitter": {"site": "@MichiganRadio", "card": "summary", "creator": "@MichiganRadio"}, "author": "Kate Wells", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Protesters rally at Planned Parenthoods, citing controversial videos"}, "nid": 23275, "datePublished": "2015-08-22", "keywords": "Planned Parenthood", "wordCount": 989, "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "This rally is one of a dozen similar protests planned at Planned Parenthood clinics around the state.\nIt really made me want to stand up to defund Planned Parenthood, because I don\u2019t want my tax dollars going to this.\nBut recent reports say the company has severed ties with Planned Parenthood after the videos were released.\nStem Express LLC reportedly used to have a contract with Planned Parenthood to process fetal tissue before sending it to medical researchers.\nBut it's so easy for us to close our eyes and not look at the videos of Planned Parenthood, because it's too hard for us to stomach.\""}
