Since his late 20's Maurer diligently followed orders and exercised regularly, but noticed his body was shrinking while his scrotum was still enlarging.\n\n\"When I go out, people do look. I mean, they can't help themselves,\" says Maurer, 39, in the video above. \"You know, they try to be polite.. but you can see when something's not right.\"\n\nAfter suffering a broken cyst inside the scrotum and spending two years going to a wound center, Maurer finally got some answers. Unfortunately the answers did not come from his doctors, but from a TLC television show called \"The Man with the 132-Pound Scrotum.\"\n\nThe TLC show followed the story of Las Vegas man Wesley Warren Jr. who suffered scrotal lymphedema, a rare condition in which an excess of watery fluid collects around the testicles as a result of blockages in the lymphatic vessel.\n\nSadly Warren passed away at the age of 49, but his story lives on, and has helped Maurer seek the right medical attention he needs.\n\nMaurer hopes to visit a doctor in California to remove his scrotum, but first needs to raise enough money to afford the costly procedure. He feels it is necessary not only for his health and own peace of mind, but for his wife Mindy, who has stood by his side throughout the whole ordeal.\n\nAlso on HuffPost: Wesley Warren Wesley Warren\n\n1 of 7 Share this slide:\n\nLas Vegas Review-Journal\n\nMore: Wesley Warren Jr. Scrotum", "article_metadata": {"description": "Dan Maurer of Battle Creek, Michigan, has decided to publicize a big problem for an important reason -- he needs help raising money for an expensive, dan...", "sailthru.expire_date": "2014-06-26 17:49:00 -0400", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "Dan Maurer of Battle Creek, Michigan, has decided to publicize a big problem for an important reason -- he needs help raising money for an expensive, dan...", "title": "Man With 100-Pound Scrotum Diagnosed, Needs Help", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/06/25/dan-maurer-100-pound-scrotum-video_n_5530803.html", "image": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1876945/images/o-SCROTUM-facebook.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Dan Maurer of Battle Creek, Michigan, has decided to publicize a big problem for an important reason -- he needs help raising money for an expensive, dan...", "title": "Man With 100-Pound Scrotum Diagnosed, Needs Help", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1876945/images/o-SCROTUM-facebook.jpg", "height": 1000}, "creator": "TheBadness1", "site": "@HuffPostWeird", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-06-25 17:49:00 -0400", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=5530803", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "weird-news", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "video,scrotal-lymphedema,enlarged scrotum,weird-medical-syndromes,100lb scrotum,dan maurer,Wesley Warren Jr. scrotum,enlarged-scrotum", "article": {"section": "Weird News", "tag": "video,scrotal-lymphedema,enlarged scrotum,weird-medical-syndromes,100lb scrotum,dan maurer,Wesley Warren Jr. scrotum,enlarged-scrotum", "published_time": "2014-06-25 17:49:00 -0400", "modified_time": "2014-06-25 20:59:02 -0400"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdf8f\"", "article_summary": "Also on HuffPost: Wesley Warren Wesley Warren1 of 7 Share this slide:Las Vegas Review-JournalMore: Wesley Warren Jr. Scrotum\nUnfortunately the answers did not come from his doctors, but from a TLC television show called \"The Man with the 132-Pound Scrotum.\"\nAfter suffering a broken cyst inside the scrotum and spending two years going to a wound center, Maurer finally got some answers.\nMaurer hopes to visit a doctor in California to remove his scrotum, but first needs to raise enough money to afford the costly procedure.\nSince his late 20's Maurer diligently followed orders and exercised regularly, but noticed his body was shrinking while his scrotum was still enlarging."}
