It was expected to take two to three days to implement the plan and do needed testing.\n\nGuidry said the \"do not drink\" advisory was issued out of an \"abundance of caution.\" He said an initial test by the company showing the elevated chlorine dioxide level was not properly followed up with more tests.\n\nThe Department of Health and Hospitals said in a news release Saturday that they had taken five samples at different sites and all showed the water was safe to drink.\n\nWater distribution points in the town, which had been providing residents with drinking water, were being closed, Mayor Leroy J. Sullivan Sr. said in a news release posted on the town's website.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "Louisiana health officials Saturday lifted a notice advising people in the small town of Donaldsonville not to drink the water after tests determined it was safe to drink.", "title": "\"Do not drink\" water advisory lifted in Louisiana town", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/do-not-drink-water-advisory-lifted-in-louisiana-town/373629951/", "image": {"url": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201083", "width": 1680, "identifier": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201083", "height": 876}, "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "twitter": {"description": "Louisiana health officials Saturday lifted a notice advising people in the small town of Donaldsonville not to drink the water after tests determined it was safe to drink.", "title": "\"Do not drink\" water advisory lifted in Louisiana town", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/do-not-drink-water-advisory-lifted-in-louisiana-town/373629951/", "image": {"src": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201083", "identifier": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201083"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "description": "Louisiana health officials Saturday lifted a notice advising people in the small town of Donaldsonville not to drink the water after tests determined it was safe to drink."}, "article_summary": "\u2014 Louisiana health officials Saturday lifted a notice advising people in the small town of Donaldsonville not to drink the water after tests determined it was safe to drink.\nHe said an initial test by the company showing the elevated chlorine dioxide level was not properly followed up with more tests.\nResidents in the small town of about 10,000 people southeast of Baton Rouge were advised Tuesday not to drink the water after an inspection showed the possibility it contained chlorine dioxide levels four to five times above national guidelines.\nWater distribution points in the town, which had been providing residents with drinking water, were being closed, Mayor Leroy J.
