Later, she chats with a politician who previously oversaw the catch-em-before-they-kill efforts and now wants to recreate the program with algorithms instead of ESP, and we learn that it was Precrime that attracted Vega to law enforcement. Which is to say, maybe she wanted an easier gig than the one she now has (even though 2065 detectives are conveniently tricked out with computerized contact lenses, mini surveillance drones resembling Harry Potter\u2019s Golden Snitches, nifty stun guns, and the like).\n\nThe world of Fox\u2019s Minority Report is one that has apparently learned this lesson all too well. A program known as \u201cPrecrime\u201d harnessed the power of three mentally gifted individuals\u2014\u201cprecogs\u201d\u2014to stop murders before they happened. But it was discontinued sometime before our story begins in 2065. The show\u2019s pilot doesn\u2019t inform you of what went wrong with Precrime, but if you\u2019ve seen Steven Spielberg\u2019s 2002 film Minority Report, an adaptation of a Philip K. Dick short story and the prequel for this new TV show, you get it. Or if you have moral questions about the downsides of preemptive warfare, stop-and-frisk, criminal profiling, and other kinds of anticipatory uses of force by the government, you probably get it.\n\nIn stories about people with mystical foresight, the drawbacks of divination are often more important than the benefits. Cassandra, after all, did not live happily ever after. See the future? Who wants that, really?\n\nFor a while, it appears that the show may subscribe to Vega\u2019s unconflicted affection for predictive policing\u2014which would have represented an unconscionable betrayal of its source material\u2019s ideals. But there are hints throughout Minority Report\u2019s pilot that the picture may end up being more complicated. The characters visit a ward for those incarcerated under the Precrime regime, all of whom now have mental problems due to their treatment by the government. A big bad plot that must be foiled results from resentments born of throwing people in jail for crimes they didn\u2019t commit. And perhaps most damning, when Vega wants to play some \u201coldies\u201d at home, she puts on an Iggy Azalea record. Clearly, her mind is not quite right.\n\nBut so far, the most important downside of foresight is of the personal kind, the psychologically trying kind. The second star of the show is Dash (Stark Sands), one of the three telepathic siblings who were released to a life of anonymous freedom once the Precrime program ended. For a decade, he was hooked into a machine, spouting out grim prophecies; now that he\u2019s in the wild, the visions haven\u2019t ended but have become patchier. Which is to say, he still sees future murders but is no longer equipped to stop them. The guilt\u2014not to mention the interruptions to his day when images of stabbings and shootings enter his mind\u2014sends him back toward helping law enforcement, where Vega teams up with him while vowing not to reveal his true identity.\n\nWhile portraying a sleek future of advanced technology, the show is clunky.\n\nThe dynamic that results is familiar but, on paper at least, compelling. Dash can\u2019t help but blurt out his premonitions, yet he doesn\u2019t want to be outed as psychic. Vega pushes him for more and more info, which can only be obtained by him crossing certain personal lines. At various points, Dash visits with his gifted brother and sister, who want no part of working for the powers that be. The levels of moral hazard here are intriguing, as are the story\u2019s connection with present-day issues around justice and safety.\n\nBut the show itself, while existing in a sleek future of advanced technology, is a bit clunky. It hews to the most obvious tropes of case-of-the-week shows about oddball visionaries partnered with law-and-order sharpshooters, and in the first hour at least, doesn\u2019t pay its audience much respect when it comes to the plausibility of dialogue, character motivations, or the security procedures at a mental institution for former future-convicts. The shoddiness is typical of many a canceled network procedural, and probably won\u2019t make viewers confident the show will competently execute upon the rich potential of its premise.
