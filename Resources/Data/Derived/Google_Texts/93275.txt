USC head coach Steve Sarkisian may not have been sober during the Trojans’ 42-14 win at Arizona State.

USC assistant coaches believe Sarkisian was inebriated during the Sept. 26 game in Tempe, Ariz. According to sources, at one point during the game coaches pulled Sarkisian out of a player huddle on the sidelines because they believed he was intoxicated.

On Sunday, USC’s athletic director placed Sarkisian on indefinite leave after it became clear to him “he was not healthy.”

Sarkisian was at USC this morning and took part in the Trojans’ special teams meeting. According to sources, players said they smelled alcohol on Sarkisian’s breath during the meeting.

Even though Sarkisian was on campus in the morning, he was not present for the team’s midday practice. When Haden learned of his absence, he called Sarkisian and could tell something was not right and asked him to take an indefinite leave during the phone call.

In his absence, offensive coordinator Clay Helton has been named interim head coach.

Sarkisian, who is in his second season as head coach of the Trojans, came under fire back in August when he gave a profanity-laced speech as a team function. Sarkisian dodged suspension at that time, but Sunday’s incident was not handled as lightly.
