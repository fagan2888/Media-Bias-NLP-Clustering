Walt Weiss told The Denver Post last month, without blinking, that he wants to return next season to manage the Rockies.

But his boss, Colorado general manager Jeff Bridich, isn’t as committed. Bridich said Sunday afternoon, in an interview with MLB Network radio, that he hasn’t made a decision on Weiss’ future.

“He’s got another year on his contract, everybody knows that,” Bridich said. “We’ll have meetings and sit down and talk and see what the right fit is.

“This isn’t the time or place yet to say 100 percent yes or no. He’s got to have a part in that too. We’ll let the season play out before we make that determination.”

Weiss, who has a 203-269 record as skipper of the Rockies, last month said that he wants to at least manage through his contract.

“Yes. I want to see this thing through. I’ve got a lot invested here. I’ve spent 14 years with this organization. I love this coaching staff. I think the staff has really done a great job.

“And I like the players, what they’re made of. We have got to get better, of course, but I think there is a good foundation. I like the makeup of these guys and the way they compete. I love that part of it.”

The Rockies hired Weiss on a one-year contract in 2013 him to replace Jim Tracy. After that season, they gave Weiss a contract extension through 2016. But his boss then was GM Dan O’Dowd, who left after last season and was replaced by Bridich.
