Too many lights, too little momentum. The new bike lanes only extend for a couple of blocks; why would a biker head down there for only 30 seconds of traffic-free riding?\n\nA) The Folsom bike lanes were already more than generous, speaking again from 30 years of riding that street.\n\nB) 30th has great lanes and good bike momentum. Again, never had a problem.\n\nC) 17th-19th is safe and fast if you're in the mid-portion of town. No problems.\n\nD) And if you're way over west, 9th and 4th are more than generously apportioned for bikes.\n\nSo either do the whole town, or drop the experiment. What use is there to the bike community in antagonizing drivers?\n\nThis is a great bike town already, and continues to become incrementally better all the time, assuming that you ride traffic both conservatively and defensively.\n\nChip Lee\n\nBoulder", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/letters/ci_28573869/chip-lee-not-much-benefit-folsom-changes", "modificationDate": "2015-08-02T19:00:35-0600", "sailthru.section": "Opinion: Letters to the editor", "endDate": "2016-08-01T19:35:35-0600", "description": "Regarding the Folsom bike discussion, I only add here, as one who uses a bike as much as a car in town, that those blocks on Folsom aren't where you see most bikers heading.", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:28573869:view"}, "startDate": "2015-08-02T19:35:35-0600", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/letters/ci_28573869/chip-lee-not-much-benefit-folsom-changes", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "Regarding the Folsom bike discussion, I only add here, as one who uses a bike as much as a car in town, that those blocks on Folsom aren't where you see most bikers heading.", "title": "Chip Lee: Not much benefit to Folsom changes"}, "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "Regarding the Folsom bike discussion, I only add here, as one who uses a bike as much as a car in town, that those blocks on Folsom aren't where you see most bikers heading.", "title": "Chip Lee: Not much benefit to Folsom changes", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/letters/ci_28573869/chip-lee-not-much-benefit-folsom-changes", "image": "http://local.dailycamera.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/dailycamera.png", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-08-02T19:35:35-0600", "sailthru.title": "Chip Lee: Not much benefit to Folsom changes", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "pubDate": "2015-08-02T19:02:14-0600", "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}}, "article_summary": "A) The Folsom bike lanes were already more than generous, speaking again from 30 years of riding that street.\nThis is a great bike town already, and continues to become incrementally better all the time, assuming that you ride traffic both conservatively and defensively.\nRegarding the Folsom bike discussion, I only add here, as one who uses a bike as much as a car in town, that those blocks on Folsom aren't where you see most bikers heading.\nB) 30th has great lanes and good bike momentum.\nThe new bike lanes only extend for a couple of blocks; why would a biker head down there for only 30 seconds of traffic-free riding?"}
