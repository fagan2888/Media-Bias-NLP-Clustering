Since the movie ends with young Bob Dylan taking the stage, wouldn\u2019t Dylan\u2019s phenomenal success and transformation of the folk music scene serve as a rising tide that lifts Llewyn Davis\u2019 leaky boat?\n\nOscar Isaac laughed at the very idea. \u201cLlewyn\u2019s stuck on the hamster wheel,\u201d he said cheerfully, adding that maybe he\u2019d wind up giving guitar lessons in Greenwich Village.\n\nNobody laughed in response. Even the suggestion that a fictional character would fail to make it in America is, apparently, deflating. It was a tough crowd for a Coen brothers film.\n\nBecause unlike most other American directors, Joel and Ethan Coen have always been interested in depicting failure. Their new film Inside Llewyn Davistakes such a steady, unblinking look at continuous humiliating defeat, it\u2019s hard to see how the film can find an audience of any size, at least in the USA. Here, we don\u2019t like to think about failure, though it stares most of us in the face every day.\n\nWe\u2019ve been conditioned to believe in the power of positive thinking. If we can\u2019t convince ourselves we\u2019re moving Onward and Upward toward success, we\u2019d rather not contemplate our lives at all.\n\nIf Inside Llewyn Davis weren\u2019t so funny, none of us could stand it.\n\nThe exemplar of failure, Llewyn Davis claims to \u201cfucking hate folk music\u201d because he\u2019s gifted at it, takes it seriously, and is getting nowhere with it, while other less talented and driven folk musicians do better than he does. The film\u2019s set in Greenwich Village, 1961, right before Dylan\u2019s ascension which will cause the general public to suddenly give a damn about folk music and start paying real money to hear it. In the pre-Dylan era, struggling folk acts play a few clubs in major cities and eke out precarious livings if they\u2019re lucky.\n\nLlewyn Davis is not lucky. He sleeps on the couches of those who are barely getting by themselves, and during the day he schleps his guitar around the snowy streets of New York City, trying to manage the mess of his life. The mess involves his chronic homelessness, his stalled career, his dicey relationship with his senile father and reproachful sister, his tendency to impregnate young women who then need money from him to pay for abortions, and his other tendency to alienate everyone including the people who are nice and kind and generous to him, or who at least could help him get somewhere career-wise. And then on top of everything else, there\u2019s the cat.\n\nThe cat is very important to the Llewyn Davis narrative. A handsome, expressive orange tabby that escapes from the apartment where Llewyn Davis is crashing, the cat becomes a minor obsession of Llewyn\u2019s. He keeps losing and finding it, chasing and carrying it around with him. But for all his trouble, the cat he returns to its worried owners turns out to be a female orange tabby virtually identical to the cat he lost. \u201cWhere\u2019s his scrotum?\u201d shrills Mrs. Goldfein. In valiantly trying to safeguard the cat, or rather both cats, Llewyn endeavors to get one small symbolic aspect of his life under control. And fails.\n\nThe circular storyline of the cat is part of the overall relentless cycle of the narrative, which starts and ends at the same place, in an alley outside a folk music club where Llewyn Davis is getting beaten up. This beginning/ending scene was the inspiration for the film, according to Ethan Coen: \u201cWe were in the office, and Joel said, \u2018OK, suppose Dave Van Ronk gets beat up outside of Gerde\u2019s Folk City. That\u2019s the beginning of a movie.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe Coens took as inspiration Dave Van Ronk \u2018s musical repertoire as well as his album Inside Dave Van Ronk, with its haunting cover image of Van Ronk, rumpled and shabby, sharing a doorway with a self-possessed grey-and-white cat. The Coens also borrowed certain Dave Van Ronk traits such as his history with the Merchant Marines and his furious contempt for commercialized pop-folk groups like the Kingston Trio. Supposedly the Coens were even intent on casting a big, shambling Van Ronk-like guy, before they auditioned the compactly built live-wire Oscar Isaac and were wowed by his combination of formidable acting and guitar-playing skills.\n\nIsaac\u2019s performances of songs such as \u201cHang Me, Oh Hang Me,\u201d \u201cFare Thee Well,\u201d and \u201cGreen, Green Rocky Road\u201d add a level of painful poignancy to the film, because Llewyn Davis isn\u2019t just some sad-sack \u2014he\u2019s fiercely talented. But he\u2019s also alienated, strident, bristling with resentment, and inclined to be uppity about his refusal to sell out, until he\u2019s truly desperate and has to grab the short-end money. In a moment of financial distress, he agrees to sit in on the recording of a hilariously dreadful novelty tune \u201cPlease, Mr. Kennedy;\u201d then at a moment of professional arrogance he blows up at his kindliest, most supportive friends because they ask him to sing a song at a social gathering. (\u201cYou know, I\u2019m not a trained poodle. I do this for a LIVING.\u201d)\n\nAs executive music producer T-Bone Burnett pointed out at the same Q and A session, Llewyn\u2019s a guy who, when he finally gets his big audition for agent Bud Grossman (F. Murray Abraham), doesn\u2019t sing something punchy like \u201cCocaine.\u201d He sings \u201cThe Death of Queen Jane,\u201d a slow, bleak ballad \u201cabout a medieval cesarean section.\u201d\n\nLlewyn Davis is ultimately no Dave Van Ronk\u2014he\u2019s not headed toward \u201cMayor of McDougal Street\u201d status, mentoring Bob Dylan, Phil Ochs, and Joni Mitchell, beloved by all. Bud Grossman\u2019s delivers the implacable verdict on Llewyn Davis: \u201cI don\u2019t see a lot of money here.\u201d\n\nThe Coens\u2019 tendency to observe human failure unblinkingly comes across as juvenile sadism to critic J. Hoberman, who in his review of Inside Llewyn Davispublished in Tablet Magazine, sums up their career in this way:\n\nAn undeniably talented two-man band of brothers, the Coens take pleasure less in confronting their audience or authority in general, than in bullying the characters they invent for their own amusement. Theirs is a comic theater of cruelty populated by a battered cast of action figures and a worldview that might have been formulated not from a Buick 6, \u00e0 la Dylan but the Olympian heights of a bunk bed in suburbia.\n\nIt\u2019s an interesting implication, that Bob Dylan\u2019s creativity is rooted in true working-class struggle, whereas the Coens\u2019 suburban middle-class background can produce no empathy for human suffering. (Actually, as is now well-known, Dylan\u2019s early circumstances were middle-class Jewish Minnesotan, like the Coens.) Since Hoberman mentions it, however, it seems to me remarkable that the Coens, who were so successful so young, should remain such exquisite observers of angst-ridden lower-class life in America.\n\nFrom the outside, people tend to imagine that a life lived perpetually struggling and short of money means melodramatically dreadful things, which of course it often does. But few imagine the continuous petty discomforts and disadvantageous trade-offs that make up the day-to-day grind. The sheer inconvenience and gratuitous difficulty of every aspect of life were among George Orwell\u2019s major revelations when studying the lives of the working poor for his book The Road to Wigan Pier.\n\nThe Coens convey with great precision the kind of maddening details that consume the lives of people who are down and out, and create relentless chains of small, dark comic incidents leading to potentially dire consequences. And the consequences all seem to involve money.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Coen brothers' hilarious new film reminds its audience that this country hates a failure", "title": "\u201cInside Llewyn Davis\u201d: America at its ugliest", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The Coen brothers' hilarious new film reminds its audience that this country hates a failure", "title": "\u201cInside Llewyn Davis\u201d: America at its ugliest", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/12/07/america_hates_failure_thats_what_the_coen_brothers_latest_film_show_us_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/12/coen_brothers.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Coen brothers' hilarious new film reminds its audience that this country hates a failure", "title": "\u201cInside Llewyn Davis\u201d: America at its ugliest", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/12/coen_brothers.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Eileen Jones", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, America, Bob Dylan, Coen Brothers, Failure, Film, Jacobin, Values", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "If Inside Llewyn Davis weren\u2019t so funny, none of us could stand it.\nTopics: America, Bob Dylan, Coen Brothers, Failure, Film, Jacobin, Values, Entertainment News, NewsThis article originally appeared on JacobinAt the Q & A session following a screening of Inside Llewyn Davis, a member of the audience asked lead actor Oscar Isaac what he thought would ultimately happen to his character, struggling folk singer Llewyn Davis.\nLlewyn Davis is not lucky.\nA handsome, expressive orange tabby that escapes from the apartment where Llewyn Davis is crashing, the cat becomes a minor obsession of Llewyn\u2019s.\nThe cat is very important to the Llewyn Davis narrative."}
