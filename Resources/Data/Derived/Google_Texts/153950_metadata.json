The new version contains updated actuarial assumptions based on the Truven Health MarketScan\u00ae Commercial Claims database, as well as significant methodology and functionality changes to support healthcare reform, pharmacy benefit planning, and federal Minimum Value Calculator reporting.\n\nBenefit Modeler now alerts users if design scenarios are not compliant with ACA requirements for ER and preventive services and out-of-pocket maximums. The tool also provides greater granularity for pharmacy reporting, including an added Specialty Drug tier and additional inputs for modeling major medical and pharmacy plan designs.\n\n\u201cHealthcare costs continue to rise, and payers are increasingly turning to data and analytics to evaluate what\u2019s working and what isn\u2019t,\u201d said Barb Graovac, senior vice president at Truven Health Analytics. \u201cBy understanding the needs of a specific population and tailoring medical and prescription drug benefits to match those needs, payers can deliver high-quality outcomes and reduce costs, all while ensuring compliance.\u201d\n\nThe upgrades to Benefit Modeler were developed in partnership with Wakely Consulting Group, one of the most recognized actuarial consulting firms in healthcare and healthcare reform.\n\nThe latest version supports HHS\u2019 Minimum Value Calculator reporting, making Benefit Modeler a \u201cone-stop\u201d resource for plan design validation by including the values needed to produce a pass/fail report for each plan option.\n\n\u201cHealthcare benefits are becoming more complex due in part to the ACA and public and private exchanges\u201d, said Julie Peper, director and senior consulting actuary at Wakely Consulting. \u201cWe\u2019re committed to partnering with Truven Health to provide the detail needed for actuarial validation of new plan designs, as well as updated methodologies that keep up with changing market trends.\u201d\n\nBenefit Modeler is built on a large pool of MarketScan claims data, which includes information from more than 350 employers and 100 health plans and pharmacy benefit managers representing 36 million lives and all 50 states.
