As usual, Johnson gave unconcerned, non-detailed answers.\n\nFirst off, what you didn't see in the clip above was Johnson's attempt yesterday to shill for illegal immigration reform as Americans raise more concerns about a lack of border security. During an answer to another lawmaker about how to prevent terrorists from going undetected inside the United States, Johnson made the absurd argument that a \"legal process\" for citizenship would prevent terror infiltration and encourage terrorists to come forward and turn themselves in. That suggestion is not only unhelpful but politically motivated garbage. Second, if Johnson got out of his cushy D.C. office once in awhile to actually talk to Border Patrol agents on the ground, he would know that radical Islamists crossing the southern border into the United States from Mexico is nothing new. Unfortunately, a lack of enforcement from Homeland Security to stop those crossings isn't new either. What is new in this scenario is a threat from ISIS and intelligence agencies have picked up chatter in the past few weeks showing the terror army is looking at the southern border as a possible way to gain access to the United States. Homeland Security officials have also confirmed this possibility in testimony to Congress.\n\nMeanwhile, little has been done at the State Department to revoke passports of Americans knowingly fighting with ISIS in Syria or Iraq.\n\nH/T Ed Morrissey", "article_metadata": {"description": "Meh. .05/26/2016 20:15:29PM EST.", "author": "Katie Pavlich", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Meh.", "title": "- Homeland Secretary Shows Little Concern Over Open Border Terror Threat", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2014/09/18/dhs-secretary-clueless-on-terror-threat-n1893567", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/207/2014-07-02T193140Z_1_LYNXMPEA610W2_RTROPTP_3_USA.JPG", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Meh.", "title": "- Homeland Secretary Shows Little Concern Over Open Border Terror Threat", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2014/09/18/dhs-secretary-clueless-on-terror-threat-n1893567", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/207/2014-07-02T193140Z_1_LYNXMPEA610W2_RTROPTP_3_USA.JPG", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Homeland Secretary Shows Little Concern Over Open Border Terror Threat, Katie Pavlich, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "Homeland Security officials have also confirmed this possibility in testimony to Congress.\nFormer Obama campaign bundler and Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson testified in front of the House Homeland Security yesterday and was peppered with questions from lawmakers about the terrorism threat presented by a lack of border enforcement and security.\nUnfortunately, a lack of enforcement from Homeland Security to stop those crossings isn't new either.\nFirst off, what you didn't see in the clip above was Johnson's attempt yesterday to shill for illegal immigration reform as Americans raise more concerns about a lack of border security.\nMeanwhile, little has been done at the State Department to revoke passports of Americans knowingly fighting with ISIS in Syria or Iraq."}
