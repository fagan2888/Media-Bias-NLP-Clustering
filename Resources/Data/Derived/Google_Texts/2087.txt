STAFFORD An investigation into shoplifting at a local Walmart led police to two Stafford men they said possessed drugs and paraphernalia as well as the stolen items.

Police arrested Todd C. Bozarth Jr., 20, and Michael N. Pillarella, 21, on Saturday after Bozarth was named as a suspect in the Walmart shoplifting incident, which happened about 12:15 p.m., according to Stafford police.

About an hour after the shoplifting happened, Patrolman Giovanni DeMarco saw a car matching the description of one sought in the incident near the 1200 block of Route 72, according to police.

Police stopped the vehicle and arrested Bozarth, who was driving, according to a news release. Police said his passenger, Pillarella, was also involved in the shoplifting incident. Pillarella was also arrested, police said.

During a search of the vehicle, police said, they found stolen items and drugs.

Stafford police charged Bozarth with possession of a hypodermic syringe, theft by deception and receiving stolen property. Pillarella was charged with two counts of shoplifting, possession of a controlled dangerous substance and possession of a hypodermic syringe.

The stolen items were returned to nearby stores, police said.

Photos of the suspects were not immediately available.
