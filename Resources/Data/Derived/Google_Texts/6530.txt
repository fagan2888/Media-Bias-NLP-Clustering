A Mexican police helicopter flew across the border into Arizona and fired two gunshots near U.S. border agents, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials confirmed.

“Early yesterday morning, a Mexican law enforcement helicopter crossed approximately 100 yards north into Arizona nearly 8 miles southwest of the Village of San Miguel on the Tohono O’odham Indian Nation,” CBP said in a statement. “Two shots were fired from the helicopter but no injuries or damage to U.S. property were reported.”

CBP said the incident, which occurred while the Mexican police helicopter was involved in a law enforcement operation near the border, remains under investigation.

Another official told CNN that Mexican authorities called U.S. authorities and called the incident a “mistake,” saying shots were fired from the helicopter after it accidentally crossed the border.
