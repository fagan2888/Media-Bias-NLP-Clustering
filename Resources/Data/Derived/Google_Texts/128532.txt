A contractor working on a house in the Westminster Heights subdivision ruptured a two-inch underground gas line Thursday. The resulting leak caused St. Landry Parish Fire District 3 to encourage occupants of that house and three others to leave.

"They were very nice about it," district chief Ray Mendenhall said at the scene. "We appreciate that because it's about their safety."

Nobody was injured. The fire department sent two trucks and four hazardous materials technicians to the neighborhood just south of Opelousas.

Centerpoint Energy, which controls the gas in that location, sent its own team to repair the rupture.

About the homeowners, Mendenhall said, "We told 'em to give us a few hours. They were very understanding."
