Procured is working with U.S. hospital systems like Hoag Hospital, Asante Health, St. Charles Health, and about two dozen others to bring some much-needed transparency to medical-device pricing.\n\nEditors\u2019 Note: Procured Health was a finalist at the \u201cGrand Rounds Innovation Showdown\u201d at VentureBeat\u2019s inaugural HealthBeat conference.\n\nIt\u2019s hardly sexy technology, but Procured is angling for a piece of a huge market. Spending on medical devices reached an estimated $150 billion in 2010. Medical device manufacturers like Medtronic and Stryker have reported gross margins that far outstrip tech behemoths of Silicon Valley, Apple, and Google.\n\nGross margins are so high, according to Procured\u2019s chief executive Hani Elias, due to the \u201creally high price points\u201d that regularly go unchecked. It\u2019s a common practice for medical-device manufacturers to require that purchasing departments keep prices confidential.\n\nThis means that manufacturers can charge some hospitals more than others for the same product. A 2012 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report found that the average cost hospitals paid for knee implants ranged from $3,408 to $10,830, and the average price paid for implantable cardioverter-defibrillators ranged from $19,578 to $35,916.\n\n\u201cHospitals have not been sophisticated evaluators of medical devices or new technology,\u201d said Procured chief operating officer Eric Meizlish in an interview with VentureBeat.\n\nThe company is building subscription-based software for hospital systems to make more informed purchasing decisions and avoid being ripped off. On the Procured Health system, doctors can leave detailed feedback and recommendations about medical devices. Before making a purchasing decision, hospital admins can use the software to pull up a variety of products, which range in quality and price. It\u2019s a timely service, with hospitals under pressure to manage their costs in the wake of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nProcured makes money but charging hospitals a fee. Pricing varies depending on the size of the system and its customer support requirements.\n\nProcured isn\u2019t the only startup bringing transparency to insurance providers and health care systems. HealthSparq is building an online shopping site for health care services, and WellPoint recently announced it will work more closely with health providers to avoid costly problems.\n\nWith Castlight Health recently experiencing a soaring IPO, venture capital firms are investing heavily in transparency. A recent report from the financial analysis firm CB Insights estimated that investors have poured $400 million into health care price-transparency companies since 2010.\n\nFacebook Get more stories like this on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"bt": {"pubDate": "2014-03-20T21:02:23+00:00", "author": "christina-farr", "modDate": "2014-03-20T21:02:23+00:00", "keywords": "health-it,hospital-system,medical-device,procured-health,transparency", "type": "news", "id": 1182213}, "og": {"site_name": "VentureBeat", "description": "Procured is working with U.S. hospital systems to bring some much-needed transparency to medical device pricing.", "title": "Procured Health gets $4M to find out why an artificial knee can cost $3,500 or\u00a0$10K", "url": "http://venturebeat.com/2014/03/20/procured-health-gets-4m-to-find-out-why-an-artificial-knee-can-cost-3500-or-10k/", "image": "http://1u88jj3r4db2x4txp44yqfj1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/procured-health-780x655.png", "type": "article"}, "description": "Procured is working with U.S. hospital systems to bring some much-needed transparency to medical device\u00a0pricing.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd86ec\"", "article_summary": "A small startup called Procured Health just secured $4 million in series A funding from health care-focused firm FCA Venture Partners.\nEditors\u2019 Note: Procured Health was a finalist at the \u201cGrand Rounds Innovation Showdown\u201d at VentureBeat\u2019s inaugural HealthBeat conference.\nA recent report from the financial analysis firm CB Insights estimated that investors have poured $400 million into health care price-transparency companies since 2010.\nHealthSparq is building an online shopping site for health care services, and WellPoint recently announced it will work more closely with health providers to avoid costly problems.\nProcured is working with U.S. hospital systems like Hoag Hospital, Asante Health, St. Charles Health, and about two dozen others to bring some much-needed transparency to medical-device pricing."}
