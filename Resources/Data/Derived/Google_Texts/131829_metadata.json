Scarlett Johansson Caught In Global Branding Firestorm\n\nOxfam publicly raised concerns after she agreed to become the commercial face of Sodastream, made in an occupied Israeli-West Bank settlement.\n\nThe international aid organization Oxfam chastised Hollywood actress Scarlett Johansson in a statement this week over her new contract with a controversial Israeli company, leaving the starlette in the crosshairs of a worldwide ethical debate.\n\nThe firm, SodaStream \u2014 a business that offers at-home, soda-making products, is based in the occupied West Bank territory and has publicly made Johansson its global brand representative. Its website prominently features several images and a glossy video of Johansson enjoying the company\u2019s products.\n\nAlthough Oxfam, based in the U.K., praised her previous work, they said it conflicted with its stance on the Israeli settlements in Gaza and the West Bank, making it difficult to further the relationship with Johansson. However, it reportedly did not ask her to sever her deal with Sodastream either.\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\nIn a statement earlier this week, the aid group said it \u201crespects the independence of our ambassadors. However, Oxfam believes that businesses that operate in settlements further the ongoing poverty and denial of rights of the Palestinian communities that we work to support. Oxfam is opposed to all trade from Israeli settlements, which are illegal under international law.\u201d\n\nThe statement goes on to say the organization had made its concerns known to Johansson but were still \u201cengaged in a dialogue on these important issues,\u201d leaving open the door that there still may be an outlet here.\n\nAn article by the Palestinian-run website ElectronicIntifada.net, a website founded by the Palestinian-American activist Ali Abunimah, on Thursday said, \u201cClearly it would be preferable if Johansson would learn the lesson and walk away from SodaStream. Either way, it is now apparent that no matter how much money you get, doing business with firms that exploit Palestinian workersand profit from Israeli crimes carries, at least, a mounting reputational cost.\u201d\n\nBy Friday, there was no official word as to whether Johansson would back out of the SodaStream deal.\n\nIn the Jewish Daily Forward, Elisheva Goldberg wrote that the factory\u2019s location is in an area \u201cwhich will likely be incorporated into Israel in any future deal,\u201d but she added, \u201cit does exploit the commercial benefits of its location, essentially profiting from occupation.\u201d\n\nAs noted by The New York Times blog The Lede, the Israeli news outlet Haaretz said that the settlement\u2019s industrial zone, in which SodaStream is located, sits \u201con the seam line between Israel and the Palestinian territories, putting it in Area C, which is under Israeli military and civil control. This means that the Palestinians need permits to work there. As far as the employers are concerned, though, they\u2019re outside the law.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for the Palestinian labor organization said in the same Haaretz article that, \u201cThis is a no-man\u2019s land. Industry, Trade and Labor Ministry inspectors don\u2019t enter Area C since it\u2019s not under Israeli sovereignty, but they\u2019re the only ones who can enforce labor laws.\u201d\n\nConfusing?\n\nLet\u2019s put it this way: if Johansson doesn\u2019t distance herself from SodaStream, she risks being rebranded \u2014 and it\u2019s a tightrope she probably didn\u2019t bank on when she signed the big contract with the sleek soda company, which she has described as a healthy and environmentally-friendly product.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Oxfam publicly raised concerns after she agreed to become the commercial face of Sodastream, made in an occupied Israeli-West Bank settlement.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Les Neuhaus", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "Oxfam publicly raised concerns after she agreed to become the commercial face of Sodastream, made in an occupied Israeli-West Bank settlement.", "title": "Gaffe Or Greed?
