The company, based in Utica and with stores in Ann Arbor, Cedar Springs, Clarkston and Farmington Hills as well, was the second in the nation to secure a federal injunction against the Obamacare contraception mandate in October 2012.\n\nCompany president Dan Weingartz is a member of an Ann Arbor-based nonprofit, Legatus, which has ties to Tom Monaghan and consists of more than 4,000 devout Catholic business owners and executives across the nation. Legatus, the Latin word for ambassador, seeks to spread the tenets of the Catholic faith.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMonaghan, former owner of Domino\u0092s Pizza and the Detroit Tigers, put the Thomas More Law School that he helped form in charge of the lawsuit filed by Weingartz, one of five Michigan companies with cases still pending that could eventually hone the Hobby Lobby decision.\n\nAs the Weingartz case sits dormant in Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati, the company\u0092s attorney remains a bit coy about the legal strategy that might be followed next.\n\nErin Mersino asserts the details of the Supreme Court\u0092s ruling in the case brought by Hobby Lobby, an arts and crafts chain with 575 stores nationwide, have been misinterpreted.\n\nHobby Lobby already provides full coverage for 16 forms of birth control, according to numerous news reports, but the court upheld the company\u0092s right to block four types of \u0093morning after\u0094 pills and Intra-Uterine Devices that violate the Catholic belief that life begins at conception.\n\nMersino suggested her client believes that the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 exempts Weingartz from providing insurance coverage for any form of contraception.\n\n\u0093My client\u0092s beliefs conform with the teachings of the Catholic church,\u0094 she said.\n\nDan Weingartz, who could not be reached for comment, carries on a family business formed in 1945. They have 170 employees who receive health care benefits but have never received any form of insurance coverage for birth control.\n\nCases pending across the nation that challenge the Obamacare mandate could shape the Hobby Lobby precedent in the future because the Supreme Court justices did not define the \u0093closely held\u0094 corporations with \u0093sincere\u0094 religious beliefs that can avoid contraception coverage.\n\nThe religious freedom law of 21 years ago requires the federal government to impose new rules and regulation by the \u0093least restrictive means\u0094 when confronting religious freedom issues cited by an employer. Mersino said the high court should have considered that employees can receive birth control products from community health clinics for an inexpensive price, rather than relying upon employer-provided benefits.\n\nMersino also said the federal fines that would be imposed upon Weingartz for failing to heed the Obamacare mandate \u0096 amounting to $100 per day, per employee \u0096 would soon add up to $6.2 million.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "National courts, National courts news, Macomb National courts news, MI National courts news, US National courts news, world National courts news.", "title": "Macomb company continues Hobby Lobby fight against contraception", "og": {"url": "http://www.macombdaily.com/article/MD/20140711/NEWS/140719904", "image": {"width": "1500px", "identifier": "http://www.macombdaily.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/MD/20140711/NEWS/140719904/AR/0/AR-140719904.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "994px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Macomb company continues Hobby Lobby fight against contraception"}, "twitter": {"domain": "macombdaily.com", "description": "In the wake of a landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision in the so-called Hobby Lobby case, Macomb County-based Weingartz Supply Company may be poised to push the envelope a bit further in allowing businesses the freedom to ban all forms of contraception", "title": "Macomb company continues Hobby Lobby fight against contraception", "url": "http://www.macombdaily.com/article/MD/20140711/NEWS/140719904", "image": {"src": "http://www.macombdaily.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/MD/20140711/NEWS/140719904/AR/0/AR-140719904.jpg?Maxh=900&Maxw=900"}, "site": "@macombdaily", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id551763849", "iphone": "id520209090", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.macombdaily"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "National courts, National courts news, Macomb National courts news, MI National courts news, US National courts news, world National courts news.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "In the wake of a landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision in the so-called Hobby Lobby case, Macomb County-based Weingartz Supply Company may be poised to push the envelope a bit further in allowing businesses the freedom to ban all forms of contraception"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf674\"", "article_summary": "Erin Mersino asserts the details of the Supreme Court\u0092s ruling in the case brought by Hobby Lobby, an arts and crafts chain with 575 stores nationwide, have been misinterpreted.\nMersino suggested her client believes that the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 exempts Weingartz from providing insurance coverage for any form of contraception.\nThe religious freedom law of 21 years ago requires the federal government to impose new rules and regulation by the \u0093least restrictive means\u0094 when confronting religious freedom issues cited by an employer.\nIn the wake of a landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision in the so-called Hobby Lobby case, Macomb County-based Weingartz Supply Company may be poised to push the envelope a bit further in allowing businesses the freedom to ban all forms of contraception from their employee health care benefits.\nCases pending across the nation that challenge the Obamacare mandate could shape the Hobby Lobby precedent in the future because the Supreme Court justices did not define the \u0093closely held\u0094 corporations with \u0093sincere\u0094 religious beliefs that can avoid contraception coverage."}
