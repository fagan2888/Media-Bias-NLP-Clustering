Among these were the need for vulnerability assessments to be conducted for all critical facilities and appropriate measures taken to mitigate potential threats,\u201d the report stated. \u201cStorm surge and flood models should also be prepared for all key facilities for more accurate projections of flooding in future storms. Also identified was the need for more emphasis on the importance of timely, accurate communications with the public during an emergency and consideration should be given to dedicating additional resources to the emergency public information effort during future crisis of this nature.\u201d\n\nRegarding the need for places to keep the trains high and dry during the next Sandy, TEEX was preaching to a choir of converts.\n\nNJ Transit earlier this year secured rail yards in Linden and Garwood to shepherd trains from flooding and falling trees.\n\nAnd NJ Transit has already addressed another suggestion in the report by putting up sandbag flood barriers to serve as a 6-foot-tall dam at its Kearny rail yard and maintenance facility, and is looking for an alternate location for its Rail Operations Center.\n\nIn a response to suggestions made by TEEX, NJ Transit said today that it has contracted with \"a private weather service to provide modeling and flooding projections, and an outside engineering firm has developed storm surge maps for critical facilities. In addition, NJ Transit has collaborated with Stevens Institute on real-time, site-specific surge modeling for use during significant weather events.\"\n\nOf the 72 damaged locomotives, 55 have returned to service and 17 are awaiting repair, including nine \"dual-power\" locomotives capable of operating in diesel or electrified territory, four electric locomotives and four diesel locomotives.\n\nOf the 248 damaged rail cars, 226 have returned to service and 22 are awaiting repair, including 14 single-level coach cars and eight multilevel coaches, informally referred to as \"double deckers.\"\n\nNJ Transit is operating 697 trains a day, close to the 700 a day offered before Sandy. The Main/Bergen Line is down three runs, while the North Jersey Coast and Morris-Essex lines are down one each and the Montclair-Boonton Line is up two trains over 14 months ago.\n\nRELATED COVERAGE\n\n\u2022 NJ Transit boss defends decision to leave trains in area hit hard by Sandy flooding\n\n\u2022 NJ Transit boss vows: Mistake that led to flooded trains won't happen again", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "'@bergen-county','@hurricane-sandy','@pm-newsletter','@river','essex-county','hoboken','hudson-county','middlesex-county','monmouth-county','morris-county','nj-transportation','ocean-county','passaic-county','union-county','warren-county'", "title": "Review of NJ Transit's response to Sandy finds need for more coordination, places to shelter trains", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Review of NJ Transit\\u0027s response to Sandy finds need for more coordination, places to shelter trains\", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2013/12/review_of_nj_transits_response_to_sandy_finds_need_for_better_coordination_more_places_to_store_trai.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/ledgerupdates_impact/photo/2013/12/ga0829storm-11-munsonjpg-6d16b600fac59e44.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"11814299\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-12-24T14:23:24Z\", \"author\": \"Mike Frassinelli/The Star-Ledger\", \"tags\": [\"@bergen-county\",\"@hurricane-sandy\",\"@pm-newsletter\",\"@river\",\"essex-county\",\"hoboken\",\"hudson-county\",\"middlesex-county\",\"monmouth-county\",\"morris-county\",\"nj-transportation\",\"ocean-county\",\"passaic-county\",\"union-county\",\"warren-county\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.nj.com/ledgerupdates_impact/photo/2013/12/13928493-thumb_square_large.jpg", "creator": "@MikeFrassinelli", "site": "@njdotcom", "card": "summary", "description": "Flooding to trains in Kearny and Hoboken caused $120 million in damage"}, "article_date_updated": "Tuesday, December 24, 2013, 11:02 AM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.nj.com/ledgerupdates_impact/photo/2013/12/ga0829storm-11-munsonjpg-6d16b600fac59e44.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"mfrassin\", \"author_nickname\": \"Mike Frassinelli/The Star-Ledger\", \"author_id\": \"5099\", \"source_blog_name\": \"New Jersey Real-Time News\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "NJ.com", "description": "Flooding to trains in Kearny and Hoboken caused $120 million in damage", "title": "Review of NJ Transit's response to Sandy finds need for more coordination, places to shelter trains", "url": "http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2013/12/review_of_nj_transits_response_to_sandy_finds_need_for_better_coordination_more_places_to_store_trai.html", "image": "http://media.nj.com/design/alpha/img/logo_njo.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NJ.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Tuesday, December 24, 2013,  9:20 AM", "article_author": "Mike Frassinelli/The Star-Ledger", "Description": "Flooding to trains in Kearny and Hoboken caused $120 million in damage"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca825\"", "article_summary": "RELATED COVERAGE\u2022 NJ Transit boss defends decision to leave trains in area hit hard by Sandy flooding\u2022 NJ Transit boss vows: Mistake that led to flooded trains won't happen again\nIn addition, NJ Transit has collaborated with Stevens Institute on real-time, site-specific surge modeling for use during significant weather events.\"\nNJ Transit is operating 697 trains a day, close to the 700 a day offered before Sandy.\nNJ Transit earlier this year secured rail yards in Linden and Garwood to shepherd trains from flooding and falling trees.\nA long-awaited independent review of NJ Transit's performance during Hurricane Sandy has found a glaring need for better coordination and more places to store trains in the event of another monster storm."}
