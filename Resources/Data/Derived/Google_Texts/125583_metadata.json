And all but one of the 13 insurers selling individual and small-group plans in the state are raising rates.\n\nThe approved increases, which are averages among the plans each insurer offers in Kentucky, are nearly identical to insurance company requests made to the state\u2019s Department of Insurance in June. Most are between 5 and 15 percent.\n\nThe highest increase, by far, comes from the carrier designed to provide the most affordable plans. The Kentucky Health Co-Operative, a nonprofit governed by its members, will see a 25.1 percent rate increase for individual plans this year. Last year, the co-op implemented a 20 percent rate hike.\n\nThe co-op was part of a government push to increase competition among insurers. Funded by a federal loan made available through the Affordable Care Act, its massive back-to-back rate increases suggest things aren\u2019t working as planned.\n\n\u201cThey got more population than they determined. They had set their rates fairly low, and they had a lot of high-cost claims. So, those three scenarios ends up in losses,\u201d said Kentucky Insurance Commissioner Sharon Clark.\n\nA recent report from the Department of Health and Human Services said the co-op had lost $50.4 million by the end of 2014.\n\nOverall, only one insurance company \u2014 WellCare Health Plans of Kentucky \u2014 requested a rate decrease.\n\nState insurance regulators approved all but two of the increases requested by insurers. Among the highest is CareSource KY, which will raise rates nearly 12 percent for individual plans it offers both on and off Kynect, the state\u2019s insurance marketplace. Golden Rule Insurance Company was granted the 11.5 percent increase it requested for plans it sells outside Kynect.\n\nSix insurers will also begin selling individual policies in Kentucky, among them Anthem and UnitedHealthCare, two of the biggest insurers in the country.\n\nRegulators slightly reduced the increase requested by Anthem Health Plans of Kentucky, granting a 12.2 percent hike for its individual plans. And the state is permitting Louisville-based Humana to raise rates for its small-group plans by 7.77 percent.\n\nSee the full list here.\n\nClark said the fluctuations are in part the result of the Affordable Care Act, which requires insurers to issue policies regardless of a person\u2019s health status or history.\n\nSoon after the law\u2019s inception, insurers had to make educated guesses about potential policyholders and rates. She said rates for 2014 and 2015 were based on only a few months of data, which didn\u2019t give insurers the knowledge needed to set realistic rates.\n\nBut the 2016 rates were based on 15 months of data, which gave carriers a better perspective on what usage had been and what they could anticipate going forward.\n\n\u201cThe market is kind of evening out to reflect that actual experience, and it usually takes three to four years for a health insurance company to really get a good understanding of who their policyholders are (and) what\u2019s been their claim experience so that the rates can become more stable and finalized,\u201d she said.\n\nClark said there was a lot of demand for knee and hip replacements, and prescriptions for diabetes and hypertension within the first few months of open enrollment. That new demand also contributed to an increase in premiums.\n\n\u201cIt will have a negative impact on consumers, but we also know that in the long run, having the needed health insurance and having the ability to get the services they need could also save them money,\u201d she said.\n\nWith rates increasing, the impact of federal subsidies provided under ACA could be diluted depending on the quality of the plan a customer chooses. Those subsidies will still be based on an individual\u2019s income.\n\n\u201cIf they elect to chose a gold plan, which is what we call a rich plan with richer benefits, their subsidy will remain the same, but their out-of-pocket will be more,\u201d Clark said.\n\nAfter insurers made their requests in June, Gov. Steve Beshear \u2014 a strong proponent of the federal health care reform law \u2014 said customers should pay attention to rate changes for their own plans, not rate increases in the system as a whole.\n\n\u201cWhen open enrollment begins this fall, Kentuckians should seek information about their individual plans, not average costs,\u201d he said. \u201cSystem-wide averages don\u2019t give a good picture of what an individual\u2019s out-of-pocket costs may be.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The highest increase, by far, comes from the carrier designed to provide the most affordable plans.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "89.3 WFPL", "description": "The highest increase, by far, comes from the carrier designed to provide the most affordable plans.", "title": "Kentuckians, Get Ready For Health Insurance Rate Hikes", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1600, "identifier": "http://wfpl.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/4927466850_0f231ee608_o-e1441850166507.jpg", "height": 656}, "updated_time": "2015-08-12T13:47:40-04:00", "url": "http://wfpl.org/kentuckians-get-ready-health-insurance-rate-hikes/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The highest increase, by far, comes from the carrier designed to provide the most affordable plans.", "creator": "@JaNelSJohnson", "image": "http://wfpl.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/4927466850_0f231ee608_o-e1441850166507.jpg", "title": "Kentuckians, Get Ready For Health Insurance Rate Hikes", "site": "@WFPLNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100006229511236, "pages": 33077174555, "app_id": 1539400482939529}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wfpllouisville", "section": "Health", "tag": "affordable care act", "published_time": "2015-08-12T08:10:05-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-12T13:47:40-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd42a5\"", "article_summary": "The Kentucky Health Co-Operative, a nonprofit governed by its members, will see a 25.1 percent rate increase for individual plans this year.\nOverall, only one insurance company \u2014 WellCare Health Plans of Kentucky \u2014 requested a rate decrease.\n\u201cWhen open enrollment begins this fall, Kentuckians should seek information about their individual plans, not average costs,\u201d he said.\nRegulators slightly reduced the increase requested by Anthem Health Plans of Kentucky, granting a 12.2 percent hike for its individual plans.\nSo, those three scenarios ends up in losses,\u201d said Kentucky Insurance Commissioner Sharon Clark."}
