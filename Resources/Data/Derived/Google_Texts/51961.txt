The Greenwood area has seen some of the highest rain totals throughout the weekend storm. On Sunday, they received nearly 4 inches of rain. All that water has caused rivers and streams to spill their banks, and roads to be covered, or even washed out.

For the second time in two years, a part of Mathis Road in Greenwood collapsed onto itself. As of Sunday night, it remained closed. It had washed out in July of 2013, and was repaired, but it happened once again in this current storm.

The Emergency Management Coordinator for Greenwood County told us, they are getting a look at the storm damage on Sunday, and will get a full damage assessment on Monday. George McKinney said, it's been a busy weekend. In fact, on Sunday morning, they had to rescue residents from two flooded neighborhoods. One in the northern part of the county, and one in the Wilson Creek Mobile Village.

"What we had to do was bring in swift water rescue boats. The DNR came in and supported us. We had to pull people out because the water was waist high."

One of the families that had to be rescued was the Moran family. Moran, his wife and their five kids had to stay at a shelter for part of Sunday. Now, they're not sure what they'll do next, since their trailer was heavily damaged by the flood waters. "I don't have no family, no friends, i don't know what to do now, no food, nothing," said Moran.

McKinney said families in this situation can get temporary help from the Red Cross and Emergency Management Department, but long term help won't be in place until the damage assessment is done. That process will start on Monday.
