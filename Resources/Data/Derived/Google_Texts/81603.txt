A group of 183 Hollywood celebrities have come together to condemn Hamas’ ideology of “hate and genocide” that has led to a “devastating loss of life” in Israel, according to Israel Hayom.

Hollywood has become more known for vocal Israel haters such as Penelope Cruz, Javier Bardem, and Mark Ruffalo, but stars such as Jon Voight and Joan Rivers have come out to defend Israel during the most recent conflict.

Now we can add the stars of Expendables 3 to the list of Israel defenders.
