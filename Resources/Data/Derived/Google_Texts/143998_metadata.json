(Photo: Paul Kieu, The Advertiser)\n\nChad Haviland and his 9-year-old son, Sam, enjoy backpacking along the Longleaf Trail, part of Kisatchie National Forest northwest of Alexandria. The wilderness sometimes makes the Havilands unreachable by cell phone and the outside world.\n\nThat\u2019s until Sam and Chad became amateur radio operators a little over a year ago. Now, the Havilands and their hand-held ham radios not only keep them connected to each other, but also to people on the other side of the globe.\n\n\u201cYou get to meet so many friends,\u201d said Sam, whose ham radio call sign is KG5AYI. \u201cI talked to India. I talked to people a couple of times in Canada. I talked to the same guy two or three times. He\u2019s cool.\u201d\n\nThe Havilands and members of the Acadiana Amateur Radio Association participated this weekend during Field Day. Hams, who set up radio stations outdoors and run them on generators, competed to contact as many stations as possible during a 24-hour period.\n\nWhile the event is a fun competition, Field Day is also an annual exercise that demonstrates how ham radio keeps worldwide communications going during emergency situations. When cell phones, the Internet and other systems fail during hurricanes, earthquakes and floods, ham operators can keep messages flowing in and out of the affected areas.\n\nThe Field Day is the first for the Havilands. Sam is ready to camp out and get on the air.\n\nSam is the youngest member of the AARA. To get their licenses, he and his dad had to pass exams on radio theory, operating practices and regulations from the Federal Communications Commission.\n\nChad, whose call is KG5AYJ, has enjoyed sharing the radio hobby with his son.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot more fun doing it with him, than just getting my technician (license) by myself,\u201d said Chad, a computer network administrator at Abbeville General Hospital. \u201cStudying with him was a lot of fun.\n\n\u201cThe (FCC) Part 97 rules were written by lawyers. So it was a real stretch with grammar and learning what the question is asking, and the math and science behind it.\n\n\u201cTo get him to pass his test and understand what we were talking about, it has pushed him way ahead in school.\u201d\n\nHam radio may soon become a family affair for the Havilands. Owen, Sam\u2019s 7-year-old brother, and his mom, Sonya, have studied for their licenses, sometimes called tickets.\n\nChad said the family\u2019s new friends through radio have been rewarding.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really enjoying being members of the (AARA) club. That\u2019s something we really hadn\u2019t thought about in advance. It\u2019s really neat to go to those meetings. A lot of those guys are older than his grandparents, but not all of them.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good to see him interact. I don\u2019t know if they took him seriously at first. They\u2019re really proud to have him in there.\u201d\n\nWant to go?\n\nField Day with the Acadiana Amateur Radio Association\n\nStars 1 p.m. Saturday\n\nThe Horse Farm, 2913 Johnston St.\n\nInformation: W5DDL.org\n\nRead or Share this story: http://www.dailyworld.com/story/news/local/2015/06/27/father-son-communicate-world/29403183/", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Local ham radio operators part of national emergency exercise Saturday.", "og": {"site_name": "DailyWorld.com", "description": "Local ham radio operators part of national emergency exercise Saturday.", "title": "Father, son communicate with the world", "url": "http://www.dailyworld.com/story/news/local/2015/06/27/father-son-communicate-world/29403183/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/dailyworld.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Local ham radio operators part of national emergency exercise Saturday.", "title": "Father, son communicate with the world", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/49c2cf3614166c10381c16da792ea23bab2b2c72/c=622-0-3880-3258&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/06/27/Opelousas/B9317878369Z.1_20150627174532_000_GEUB65CMJ.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@", "site": "@", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=898315311", "fb": {"app_id": 164724483570611}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "Sam Haviland, 9, speaks about the amateur radio, or ham radio, equipment on Wednesday at Abbeville General Hospital in Abbeville.\nField Day with the Acadiana Amateur Radio AssociationStars 1 p.m. SaturdayThe Horse Farm, 2913 Johnston St.Information: W5DDL.orgRead or Share this story: http://www.dailyworld.com/story/news/local/2015/06/27/father-son-communicate-world/29403183/\n\u201cYou get to meet so many friends,\u201d said Sam, whose ham radio call sign is KG5AYI.\nThat\u2019s until Sam and Chad became amateur radio operators a little over a year ago.\nHe\u2019s cool.\u201dThe Havilands and members of the Acadiana Amateur Radio Association participated this weekend during Field Day."}
