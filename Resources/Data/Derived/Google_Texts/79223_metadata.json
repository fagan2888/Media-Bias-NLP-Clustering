They were the result of four generations from grandparents who were brother and sister.\n\nAs well as the attempted abduction charges Ms Colt is accused of recruiting another son to commit a criminal act. Police allege she wanted the son, named \u2018Bobby\u2019 by the court, to help her abduct his siblings.\n\nShe is also alleged to have smuggled two of the children a mobile phone and charger to open a secret line of communication.\n\nProsecutors alleged in Moss Vale Local Court today Ms Colt planned to take her children to South Australia and have them work as fruit pickers to earn money.\n\nThey alleged she was not only trying to use them for financial gain but influence them in relation to the ongoing investigation.\n\nThe court heard Ms Colt was alleged to have told her son Bobby \u201cnot to talk to anyone\u201d and that they \u201cdon\u2019t know who your father is\u201d, The Daily Telegraph reported.\n\nMs Colt\u2019s lawyer Phil Carey argued the plan wasn\u2019t kidnapping as the boy didn\u2019t voice a clear lack of consent.\n\nIn 2012 after the Colt family were discovered some children were placed with foster families, others put in treatment programs for sexualised behaviour and psychological trauma. They have had some contact with their parents and siblings.\n\nThe public first became aware of the shocking case when the Children\u2019s Court, in a rare move, released its findings that led to 12 children being placed in care.\n\nDespite several at-risk reports by authorities into the family it wasn\u2019t until the teacher came forward that action was taken.\n\nWhen the raid occurred Betty Colt was found sharing a marital bed with her brother Charlie and her children, same only as young as 10, were the result of sex between Ms Colt and her brother, father or another close male relative.\n\nThe five family groups comprised of sisters, Rhonda, 47, Martha, 33, and Betty Colt, 46, who slept every night with her brother, Charlie, and two of Betty\u2019s daughters who each had children who proved to be from unions of related parents.\n\nCharlie Colt fled to the UK in June after fearing he would never get a fair trial in Australia. In an exclusive interview he told the Daily Telegraph he\u2019d never abused anyone in his life.\n\n\u201cI love my whole family dearly, but not sexually. I think it\u2019s absolutely disgusting, it\u2019s wrong, it\u2019s against everything we were brought up with.\u201d\n\nDespite genetic testing revealing at least 14 Colt children had parents who were related, Charlie dismissed that as \u201cabsolute rubbish\u201d.\n\nThe Daily Telegraph reported the Children\u2019s Court was told that the sister, given the pseudonym Tammy Colt, 29, gave birth to her baby Sally, who died within two months from a fatal genetic disorder known as Zellweger Syndrome. Sally was born \u201cextremely dysmorphic\u201d with the thick short neck and lowset ears typical of the syndrome.\n\nThe father was not named on the birth certificate but Tammy has since told counsellors she had been having a relationship for three years with a younger brother.\n\nGenetic testing on the baby girl showed the genetic abnormalities existed as a result of incest and it is believed both parents are carriers of the genetic disease.\n\nA doctor made an appointment for Tammy and her mother, Betty Colt, to see her to warn them of the dangers but neither of them turned up.\n\nAUSTRALIA\u2019S WORST INCEST CASE\n\nEight of the Colt children have parents who were either brother and sister, mother and son or father and daughter.\n\nA further six have parents who were either aunt and nephew, uncle and niece, half siblings or grandparents and grandchild.\n\nInterviews with the Colts revealed the family saga began back in New Zealand, in the first half of last century when June Colt was born to parents who were brother and sister.\n\nJune married Tim and in the 1970s the couple emigrated to Australia.\n\nThe family would then move, several times, between South Australia, Western Australia, and Victoria, usually living in remote rural communities, shying away from public knowledge about the truth.\n\nTim and June gave birth to four daughters and two sons.\n\nThree of the daughters \u2014 Rhonda, 47, Betty, 46, and Martha, 33, and at least one of the sons, Charlie, form the elder members of the family group in the NSW bush camp.\n\nBetty had 13 children.\n\nShe contended their father was a man called Phil Walton, now dead, who was known to the family as Tim.\n\nBut genetics show one of her children, Bobby, 15, was fathered either by her father, whose name was Tim, or the brother she was sleeping with.\n\nFour more of Betty\u2019s children were fathered by a close family member.\n\nBetty\u2019s eldest child, Raylene, now aged 30, has a 13-year-old daughter, Kimberly.\n\nRaylene insists Kimberly\u2019s father is a man called Sven, from Sweden or Switzerland.\n\nTesting identifies Kimberly\u2019s father as either her half brother, an uncle or a grandfather.\n\nBetty\u2019s second oldest child, Tammy, now aged 27, has given birth to three daughters, one of whom died from a rare genetic disorder, and all of whom, she eventually admitted, were fathered by her closest brother, Derek, 25.\n\nBetty\u2019s younger sister, Martha Colt, 33, has five children, four of whom were fathered by her own father, Tim, or by her brother, and another who is the product of a union with a close relation.\n\nIt was the 10 youngest of Betty and Martha\u2019s children, and Raylene\u2019s daughter, Kimberly, 13, who ran wild in a sexual spree about the property.\n\nBetty\u2019s children, Bobby, 15, Billy, 14, Brian, 12, Dwayne, 9, and Carmen, 8, all have parents who are close family members.\n\nMartha\u2019s children, Albert, 15, Jed, 14, Ruth, 9, and Nadia, 7, are also the product of closely-related parents.\n\nDEPRAVED SECRETS\n\nCourt documents obtained by news.com.aurevealed the shocking extent of the conditions the family lived in although a court order forbids news.com.au saying exactly where the family lived in.\n\n-Exposed electric wires, bags of rubbish and chainsaws lay about.\n\n-There were no toilets, showers or baths.\n\n-The children were unwashed and wore dirty clothes.\n\n-They were shy and made little eye contact.\n\n-Few were capable of intelligible speech; almost all had fungal infections in their feet.\n\n-Some had oddly-formed features, which scientific tests would later reveal was a result of \u201chomozygosity\u201d or identical gene patterns of both of the children\u2019s parents.\n\nThe children were sexually involved with each other and only one, the youngest, a five-year-old girl, had parents who weren\u2019t related.\n\nPolice and welfare officers saw a social time bomb exploding before their eyes with one officer reportedly saying she would never get over it or forget it.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://resources.newscdn.com.au/cs/nca/latest/public/img/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "news.com.au", "description": "A WOMAN at the centre of one of Australia\u2019s most infamous incest cases faced court this afternoon on charges she tried to abduct two of her children.", "generator": "tcog", "og": {"site_name": "NewsComAu", "description": "A WOMAN at the centre of one of Australia\u2019s most infamous incest cases faced court this afternoon on charges she tried to abduct two of her children.", "title": "\u2018Incest\u2019 mum to face court", "url": "http://www.news.com.au/national/incest-mum-betty-colt-faces-court-over-alleged-kidnap-attempt/news-story/d74619f12e677ef4c16d803eea8e2f48", "image": "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/9aa1d56f70af0ebe9b9c3d53ed47322a", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@newscomauHQ", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "\u2018Incest\u2019 mum to face court"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "robots": "noarchive", "fb": {"admins": "1533025129,653135158,737988273", "app_id": 113758722003364}, "articleid": "d74619f12e677ef4c16d803eea8e2f48", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://resources.newscdn.com.au/cs/nca/latest/public/img/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "application-name": "news.com.au", "article": {"publisher": "News Limited", "published_time": "2014-09-01T06:08:00.000Z", "publicationdate": "01/09/2014", "modified_time": "2014-09-01T08:43:45.000Z", "author": "STAFF WRITER"}, "keywords": "Colt family,incest family,foster care,genetic testing,close family,social services raid,genetic disorder,Incest case,infamous incest cases,close family members,identical gene patterns,WORST INCEST CASE,police investigation,faces court,birth certificate,treatment programs,family home,court order,family groups,family saga,eye contact,STAFF WRITER,baby girl,mobile phone,close male relative,eldest child,secret line,Exposed electric wires,real identity,welfare officers,elder members,teenage sons,exclusive interview,intelligible speech,lowset ears,absolute rubbish,fair trial,rare genetic disorder,remote rural communities,fatal genetic disorder,incestuous relationships,closest brother,New Zealand,South Australia,Australia,Western Australia,New South Wales,Sweden,Switzerland,Daily Telegraph,Department of Family and Community,Raylene,Charlie Colt,Derek,Phil Walton,Rhonda,Albert,Jed,Kimberly,Billy,Brian,Sally,Bobby", "google-site-verification": "GWTbDFKaKnGKyk3q0Na5jIbWHZ4qXn-ibcfMayjSQA0", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf5ec\"", "article_summary": "Police raided the Colt family home in rural south-western New South Wales in July 2012 after a teacher alerted authorities to a conversation overheard in the playground that detailed the incest.\nBetty Colt, 48, was expected to have learned her fate at Moss Vale Local Court today, however a court spokesman told news.com.au the case had been adjourned until September 12 for a decision.\nAUSTRALIA\u2019S WORST INCEST CASEEight of the Colt children have parents who were either brother and sister, mother and son or father and daughter.\nA doctor made an appointment for Tammy and her mother, Betty Colt, to see her to warn them of the dangers but neither of them turned up.\nSTAFF WRITER news.com.auA WOMAN at the centre of one of Australia\u2019s most infamous incest cases faced court this afternoon on charges she tried to abduct two of her children."}
