Manning signed the ball.\n\n\u201cI was shaking,\u201d Ysais said as he showed the ball to his father. \u201cI said, \u2018Thank you.\u2019 \u201c\n\nWATCH: Broncos roundtable with Jake Plummer, Rod Smith and Ed McCaffrey\n\nThe Ysias family, all Broncos fans, traveled Sunday from Alberquerque, N.M., for the big game. Win or lose, though, Ysias had a treasure to take home.\n\nFans arrived early for the showdown against Green Bay, and the area around the stadium was brimming with the hoopla one would expect when two undefeated teams with legendary quarterbacks meet near the mid-point of the season.\n\nThe NBC Sunday Night Football bus boasted a long line of fans waiting for a chance to get a peek inside. Galeth Bolanos of Denver was hired by a marketing company to work with the bus\u2019s crew for the weekend. Bolanos was thrilled to have the gig. But he had to temper his Broncos loyalty since Sunday Night Football is non-partisan.\n\n\u201cWith Packers fans, I\u2019m being neutral,\u201d he said. \u201cIn my heart, I\u2019m a Broncos fan.\u201d\n\nBronco orange and blue was everywhere in the parking lot but Green Bay fans were making themselves known, too.\n\nChrystal Rhea, a Wisconsin native who lives in Denver, organized a Green Bay tailgate outside the stadium and word spread among the Packer faithful in Denver who were fired up for a rare chance to see their team in their new hometown.\n\n\u201cThis is like a Super Bowl for us,\u201d Rhea said. \u201cThis only happens every eight years. We\u2019re going all out.\u201d\n\nRhea was decked head-to-toe in yellow and green. She wore a silver belt like those worn by WWE champions except she had glued a Packers logo on it, and attached Aaron Rogers name to it.\n\nShe also was wearing a \u201ccheese bra,\u201d a play on the famous Green Bay cheese wedge fans wear on their heads.\n\n\u201cThis is the highlight of my year,\u201d she said.\n\nRich Lucero, a Broncos fan from Aurora, had another use for cheese \u2013 cooking it.\n\nHe was making cheese quesadillas at his tailgate party on the west side of the stadium. And he wasn\u2019t shy about offering cheese to Packer fans, \u201csince we\u2019re going to melt their cheese tonight.\u201d\n\nLucero had arrived before dawn so he could be first in line for tailgating. His family has held season tickets for 35 years, and his father insists they party in the same spot before every game. Sunday\u2019s game was among the biggest in the history of the franchise.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Super Bowl-Ish,\u201d Lucero said. \u201cWe\u2019re playing for 7 and 0. We want to smash these guys!\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Excitement builds as Broncos-Packers kickoff nears at Sports Authority Field", "title": "Excitement builds as Broncos-Packers kickoff nears at Sports Authority Field", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/11/01/excitement-builds-as-broncos-packers-kickoff-nears-at-sports-authority-field/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151101_050426_broncos-fans.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151101_050426_broncos-fans.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-01T17:00:14+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-20T03:02:25+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "She also was wearing a \u201ccheese bra,\u201d a play on the famous Green Bay cheese wedge fans wear on their heads.\nIt was Peyton Manning, and he reached for the football Ysias was holding.\nFor 12-year-old Ysias Lucero, it was hard to contain his emotions as his hero walked toward the stadium.\nIt was nearly four hours before kickoff but the air was filled with excitement outside Sports Authority Field.\n\u201cIn my heart, I\u2019m a Broncos fan.\u201dBronco orange and blue was everywhere in the parking lot but Green Bay fans were making themselves known, too."}
