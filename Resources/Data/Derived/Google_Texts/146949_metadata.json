The police have registered cases under section 406 (criminal breach of trust) and section 420 (cheating) of Indian Penal Code.\n\nOf the 4,244 gold loan accounts in the branch, the verification of documents related to 785 accounts has been completed. According to sources in the DCIB, the loan was issued to 486 persons against fake gold and 183 persons without mortgaging the gold. According to the existing rules, 75 percent of the value of the gold mortgaged should be issued as loan. The amount of loan issued for 76 persons has exceeded this limit. The police would soon complete the process of verification of the remaining 3,459 gold loan accounts in the branch.\n\nFollowing these developments, hundreds of customers thronged the branches of DCC Bank in Gopala and Vinobha Nagar localities in the city on Friday and Saturday to withdraw the amount they had parked in the bank as term deposit and the gold they had deposited in safe lockers. An official of DCC Bank, on condition of anonymity, said that more than Rs. 50 lakh was withdrawn from these branches on Friday and Saturday. The police were deployed here to avoid untoward incidents.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Based on the complaint, the police on Thursday arrested Ravindra, a cashier, Shashidhar, joint custodian of gold loan section, Malathesh, a \u2018D\u2019 group employee, and Sundar Shet, a jeweller who used to", "application-name": "The Hindu", "author": "Staff Correspondent", "og": {"site_name": "The Hindu", "description": "Based on the complaint, the police on Thursday arrested Ravindra, a cashier, Shashidhar, joint custodian of gold loan section, Malathesh, a \u2018D\u2019 group employee, and Sundar Shet, a jeweller who used to", "title": "Five arrested in DCC gold loan scam", "url": "http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/five-arrested-in-dcc-gold-loan-scam/article6252843.ece", "image": {"width": 300, "identifier": "http://www.thehindu.com/template/1-0-1/gfx/oghindunew1.jpg", "height": 300}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "thehindu.com", "description": "Based on the complaint, the police on Thursday arrested Ravindra, a cashier, Shashidhar, joint custodian of gold loan section, Malathesh, a \u2018D\u2019 group employee, and Sundar Shet, a jeweller who used to", "title": "Five arrested in DCC gold loan scam", "url": "http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/five-arrested-in-dcc-gold-loan-scam/article6252843.ece", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "The Hindu", "iphone": "The Hindu for iPhone", "googleplay": "The Hindu (Official App)"}, "id": {"ipad": 584786636, "iphone": 771672321, "googleplay": "com.mobstac.thehindu"}}, "site": "@The_Hindu", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": ",Karnataka, Bangalore", "DC.date.issued": "2014-07-26", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=584786636", "fb": {"app_id": 137450626398044}, "google-play-app": "app-id=com.mobstac.thehindu", "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.thehindu.com/", "google-site-verification": "F3yyKM72R91NorcXieBJf3tFVoXfRS6J4lvlrLLx_80", "msvalidate.01": "F7E9CC8B958E58DDD2CFA99A12CA48DF", "article": {"section": "Karnataka", "published_time": "2014-07-26T21:54:37+05:30", "modified_time": "2014-07-26T21:54:37+05:30"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe to RSS; action-uri=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/?service=rss; icon-uri=http://www.thehindu.com/favicon.ico", "news_keywords": ",Karnataka, Bangalore"}, "article_summary": "Of the 4,244 gold loan accounts in the branch, the verification of documents related to 785 accounts has been completed.\nBased on the complaint, the police on Thursday arrested Ravindra, a cashier, Shashidhar, joint custodian of gold loan section, Malathesh, a \u2018D\u2019 group employee, and Sundar Shet, a jeweller who used to assess the value of gold.\nThe police would soon complete the process of verification of the remaining 3,459 gold loan accounts in the branch.\nAccording to sources in the DCIB, the loan was issued to 486 persons against fake gold and 183 persons without mortgaging the gold.\nAn official of DCC Bank, on condition of anonymity, said that more than Rs."}
