Or it could be that Brady's fingers have weakened with age.\n\nJe suis Tom! Je suis Bill!\n\n\"Je n'aime pas les balles degonfles!\"\n\nThe French might even join us, to show we're friends, and French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius might bring Gallic musical entertainment, perhaps 90-year-old Charles Aznavour opening for French rappers IAM or Supreme NTM.\n\nAnd after all this hype about what Brady and Belichick did with the balls, you know what's going to happen, don't you?\n\nThey'll serve up a head.\n\nOr rather, the Brady-hating sports media will be given a head, and they might as well stick it up on the walls of ESPN, kind of like what they did to the honorable Ned Stark on \"Game of Thrones\"\n\nBut the head of some nondescript ball boy for the New England Patriots.\n\nOnly weeks ago, the NFL story involved running backs either knocking their fiancees out with one punch or whipping their children with sticks.
