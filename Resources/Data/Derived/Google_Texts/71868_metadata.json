It\u2019s a dubious mission that could ultimately cause more harm than good \u2014 a mission David said \u201chas a ready-shoot-aim quality to it.\u201d\n\nPresident Barack Obama is using American troops to combat Ebola to show the world he cares enough to send our very best. But our soldiers aren\u2019t Hallmark greeting cards.\n\nDavid's argument against sending American military forces to Africa was distributed by McClatchy, one of the nation\u2019s premier news services. So far, David\u2019s work is known to have appeared in at least 56 different newspapers across the country and even around the world \u2014 including the Pittsburgh Tribune Review, Honolulu Star-Advertiser, Omaha World-Herald, Salt Lake City Deseret News, Fresno Bee, Gulf Today (United Arab Emirates) and Canada Free Press.\n\nIt\u2019s even been published in Stars and Stripes, the newspaper of the American military!\n\nIn his commentary, David listed four reasons why the American military should not be deployed to Africa to fight Ebola:\n\n\u201cOur military is already overextended.\u201d Pentagon estimates suggest American forces are already strained while facing still more planned reductions.\n\n\u201cMilitary intervention in West Africa risks a quagmire.\u201d Things are likely to get worse in Ebola-afflicted Africa, and that would likely mean an escalation in the American presence there.\n\n\u201cThe Centers for Disease Control isn\u2019t ready.\u201d Health care workers were found to be unprepared for the few cases of Ebola that already hit American soil, and the problem could soon be amplified by thousands of troops cycling in and out of the infected region.\n\n\u201cMilitarization of humanitarian aid risks involvement in internal disputes.\u201d Ebola-afflicted African countries already had unstable leadership before the outbreak, and an American presence could be seen as taking sides with those governments in their internal disputes.\n\nEven though David was supposed to be part of a debate, it seemed that James Jay Carafano of The Heritage Foundation \u2014 meant to provide an opposing viewpoint \u2014 was more in agreement that David with concerns about the mission and the safety of American forces than not.\n\nFor example, Carafano wrote that \u201c[h]elping West Africa deal with Ebola is a humanitarian mission \u2014 not a national security deployment.\u201d He also wondered, \u201c[I]s the president simply throwing some troops at the problem so he can say he\u2019s done something?\u201d\n\nAnd both specifically agreed that a travel ban placed on infected areas, something Obama has opposed, would be a better step to take before sending in the troops.\n\nAs David pointed out:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://www.conservativeblog.org/storage/paper111314.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1415896581831", "description": "Despite the fact that Ebola no longer dominates the news as it once did, the National Center&r...", "title": "Ridenour Op-Ed against U.S. Troops in Ebola Hot Zone Published in 56 Papers and\u00a0Counting - Amy Ridenour's National Center Blog - A Conservative Blog"}, "blogburst-verify": "B9EORVLmLdD0z2JKwETUEmoZ", "Robots": "index,follow"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf1ba\"", "article_summary": "David's argument against sending American military forces to Africa was distributed by McClatchy, one of the nation\u2019s premier news services.\nIt\u2019s even been published in Stars and Stripes, the newspaper of the American military!\nObama ordered our brave troops into the \u201chot zone\u201d in Africa.\n\u201cMilitary intervention in West Africa risks a quagmire.\u201d Things are likely to get worse in Ebola-afflicted Africa, and that would likely mean an escalation in the American presence there.\nIt\u2019s a dubious mission that could ultimately cause more harm than good \u2014 a mission David said \u201chas a ready-shoot-aim quality to it.\u201dPresident Barack Obama is using American troops to combat Ebola to show the world he cares enough to send our very best."}
