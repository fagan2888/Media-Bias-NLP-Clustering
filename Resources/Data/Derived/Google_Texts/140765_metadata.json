Rick Perry on Friday told a national audience of conservatives that it\u2019s time for a rebellion against a \u201cpower-hungry, oppressive\u201d Barack Obama.\n\nHours later, fellow Texan and tea party firebrand Sen. Ted Cruz edged closer to confirming that he too may mount a 2016 White House run, saying that as many as 15 Republicans are mulling one and hinting that he soon could be one of them. Cruz had largely ducked such questions previously, saying only that his focus was \u201c100 percent on the U.S. Senate.\u201d\n\nBoth Perry and Cruz landed plum speaking slots at the RedState Gathering in Fort Worth, with the governor helping open the influential conservative blog\u2019s annual conference and the senator keynoting an evening session. The pair eventually could find themselves competing for the same slice of the GOP electorate, religious and social conservatives energized by an intense mistrust of Obama.\n\n\u201cThomas Jefferson was right when he said, \u2018A little rebellion now and then is a good thing,\u2019 \u201d Perry said told the RedState crowd to cries of \u201cAmen!\u201d \u201cAnd now, faced with another power-hungry, oppressive ruler in a faraway place, it\u2019s time for us to start a little rebellion.\u201d\n\nBut the reception from hundreds of attendees was far more raucous for Cruz, who RedState founder Erick Erickson introduced as \u201cthe leader of the conservative movement in the United States of America\u201d and who got a standing ovation before his speech started. Cruz also was later compared to all four Beatles rolled into one, and to one of America\u2019s Founding Fathers.\n\nIn 2011, Perry used RedState\u2019s national convention to kick off his presidential campaign \u2013 and Cruz, at the time just an underdog Senate candidate, was among the undercard speakers.", "article_metadata": {"description": "FORT WORTH, Texas \u2013 Sounding like he\u2019s almost made up his mind to run again for president, Texas Gov.
