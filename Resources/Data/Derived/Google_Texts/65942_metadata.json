Bob McDermott\n\nA middle school sex ed program will only be taught to Hawaii students if parents explicitly opt-in, the state Department of Education said today. The announcement was the culmination of a long campaign by a virulently anti-gay state legislator who objected that the program was \u201cnormalizing\u201d homosexuality.\n\nHawaii State Rep. Bob McDermott considers gay sex \u201caberrant behavior\u201d and has been fighting to eliminate the sex ed program, called Pono Choices, for months. McDermott believes that men should \u201cnot have anal sex\u201d and \u201calso has problems with oral sex.\u201d\n\nIn January, McDermott produced an 18-page report lambasting the program. In the report, McDermott complained the sex ed curriculum was \u201csimultaneously normalizing anal sex and homosexual behavior\u201d and after taking the course students \u201cmight be under the impression that homosexuality and lesbianism are quite common.\u201d He objected to the programs \u201cimplicit endorsement of homosexuality\u201d and the presentation of \u201chomosexual behavior as the equivalent of male-to-female relationships.\u201d\n\nAfter McDermott\u2019s initial complaints, the state suspended the program for ten days last December. Following an internal review, the state said that the \u201cthe curriculum meets department standards\u201d and \u201cis a culturally responsive curriculum that has resulted in positive outcomes for students.\u201d The program was reinstated.\n\nLater, in response to McDermott\u2019s continued complaints, the state created \u201ca volunteer working group of parents, educators, religious leaders and health professionals to evaluate the curriculum\u2019s appropriateness.\u201d The panel largely affirmed the curriculum\u2019s medical accuracy and age-appropriateness but recommended a few small changes. Nevertheless, simultaneous with the report of the volunteer panel, the state announced the program would only be offered on an \u201copt-in\u201d basis. Previously, parents were given the option to \u201copt-out\u201d of the program.\n\nMcDermott was particuarly fixated on the fact that curriculum included \u201canus\u201d in the category of \u201cgenitalia.\u201d (The Hawaii Civil Beat reported that McDermott was \u201cobsessed with anuses.\u201d ) The medical professionals on the volunteer panel noted that classification was common in certain areas of medicine, such as dermatology. The panel did, however, suggest some clarifying language.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t appear to be a good time for Hawaii to be cutting back on sex education. The state has a significant teen pregnancy issue, with nearly 10% of girls becoming pregnant between the ages of 15 and 19. Just \u201c54 percent of Hawaii\u2019s high school students reported using condoms the last time they had intercourse,\u201d the lowest rate in the nation.\n\nMcDermott has also sued to overturn marriage equality in Hawaii and objected to teachers participating in a tolerance program created by the Southern Poverty Law Center.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Pandering to intolerance.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Pandering to intolerance.", "title": "This Lawmaker Complained Sex Education Was \u2018Normalizing\u2019 Homosexuality And His State Took Action", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/06/07/3446261/hawaii-makes-sex-ed-curriculum-opt-in-after-lawmaker-complained-it-was-promoting-homosexuality/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/AP714394122937-1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Pandering to intolerance.", "creator": "@JuddLegum", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/AP714394122937-1-321x214.jpg", "title": "This Lawmaker Complained Sex Education Was \u2018Normalizing\u2019 Homosexuality And His State Took Action", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/AP714394122937-1.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/AP714394122937-1.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-07T20:20:17+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/juddcooperlegum"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Health This Lawmaker Complained Sex Education Was \u2018Normalizing\u2019 Homosexuality And His State Took Action CREDIT: AP Hawaii state Rep.
