The American political system is held together by shared adherence to a set of political norms, and Donald Trump has found unanticipated electoral success by promising to trample over many of them. He\u2019s going to ban members of entire religion from entering the United States, he\u2019s going to coerce one of our neighbors and primary trading partners to funding an unrealistic infrastructure project, and he\u2019s going to do all of this through sheer will and determination on his part. The Trump vision of government is \u201cTrump\u2019s will be done.\u201d\n\nIn the precious few days since he forced his last remaining competitors from the Republican primary, we\u2019ve seen Trump\u2019s authoritarianism evolve still further. Trump is no longer simply promising to get things done; he\u2019s threatening political retribution against non-governmental entities who might hinder the realization of Trump\u2019s agenda.\n\nThe New York Times reported last week on a series of interviews Trump gave describing what his first 100 days in office would look like, and per the nominee, his first day as president would be spent on the phone threatening the heads of major corporations to alter their business models or face punitive tariffs:\n\nOn his first day in office, he said, he would meet with Homeland Security officials, generals, and others \u2013 he did not mention diplomats \u2013 to take steps to seal the southern border and assign more security agents along it. He would also call the heads of companies like Pfizer, the Carrier Corporation, Ford and Nabisco and warn them that their products face 35 percent tariffs because they are moving jobs out of the country.\n\nAnd just Thursday night, Trump went on Sean Hannity\u2019s Fox News program and strongly suggested that, as president, he\u2019d go after Amazon \u2013 and its owner Jeff Bezos \u2013 on anti-trust grounds as payback for critical Trump reporting from the Washington Post, which Bezos also owns.\n\n\u201cAmazon is controlling so much of what they\u2019re doing,\u201d Trump said of the Post. \u201cAnd what they\u2019ve done is he bought this paper for practically nothing and he\u2019s using that as a tool for political power against me and against other people and, I\u2019ll tell you what, we can\u2019t let him get away with it.\u201d\n\nSet aside the thorny question of whether Amazon actually does represent a monopoly, because that\u2019s not really what is at issue here. What we\u2019re seeing in Trump is a would-be president who proudly and openly maintains a list of enemies, and who seems pretty eager to use the considerable powers of the presidency to inflict retribution on people who he believes have wronged him or are behaving in ways that are contrary to his political agenda. That\u2019s a frightening prospect, and it would represent a flagrant deviation from accepted political norms.\n\nOne irony in all this is that conservatives who are both pro- and anti-Trump describe his rise as a reaction to alleged abuses of the Obama era \u2013 the use of executive orders to direct immigration policy, the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, and, notably, the (unfounded) accusation that the administration used the IRS to target political enemies. And after years of howling over the \u201ctyranny\u201d they spied in the Obama administration\u2019s every move, the GOP has gone and nominated a candidate who openly aspires to be a tyrant.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Trump seems hell-bent on inflicting retribution on people who he believes have wronged him.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Alternet", "description": "Trump seems hell-bent on inflicting retribution on people who he believes have wronged him.", "title": "Will Donald Trump Reinvent the Enemies List If Elected?", "url": "http://www.alternet.org/video/will-donald-trump-reinvent-enemies-list-if-elected", "image": "http://www.alternet.org/files/story_images/5440384453_4669d0096b_b.jpg", "type": "article"}, "dc": {"title": "Will Donald Trump Reinvent the Enemies List If Elected?"}, "fb": {"page_id": 17108852506, "pages": 17108852506}, "google-site-verification": "-yUzdOYz6i2iShII0x_PYzsvnhQUG2f751funoPlCNM", "article": {"published_time": "2016-05-13T16:58:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.1, maximum-scale=10.0"}, "article_summary": "He\u2019s going to ban members of entire religion from entering the United States, he\u2019s going to coerce one of our neighbors and primary trading partners to funding an unrealistic infrastructure project, and he\u2019s going to do all of this through sheer will and determination on his part.\nWill Donald Trump Reinvent the Enemies List If Elected?\nTrump is no longer simply promising to get things done; he\u2019s threatening political retribution against non-governmental entities who might hinder the realization of Trump\u2019s agenda.\nThe American political system is held together by shared adherence to a set of political norms, and Donald Trump has found unanticipated electoral success by promising to trample over many of them.\n\u201cAmazon is controlling so much of what they\u2019re doing,\u201d Trump said of the Post."}
