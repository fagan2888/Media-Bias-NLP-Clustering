The Shapiro Undergraduate Library cleared away some dusty and disposable books on the first floor and six cots were installed, offering weary students \u201ca safe place for brief spells of restorative sleep,\u201d or \u201cnaps,\u201d as they are known in campus shorthand.\n\nThese brief spells have been limited to 30 minutes, and the space, in a well-trafficked area on the first floor of Shapiro, was equipped with vinyl cots, disinfecting wipes, disposable pillowcases, and lockers.\n\nRelated: The One Quick Way to Boost Worker Productivity\n\nThis development was greeted with much joy on campus, as can be seen at @UmichNaps, a wrenching site showing the many odd places and ways that exhausted Michigan students had been falling asleep on campus, due to studying all night, or perhaps overcommitting to mid-week beer pong marathons.\n\nLibrary assistants say sleeping in the library is so common that they regularly have to tour the premises, checking on curled-up students to make sure they haven\u2019t passed out or passed on.\n\nDetractors observed that throwing out all those books so that students could sleep during the day was an unfortunate bit of symbolism, particularly since most students on this massive campus (though not commuters) already had safe places for brief spells of restorative sleep, usually known as \u201cdorms.\u201d Some wags argued that a restorative nap might be accompanied by a restorative snack next to each cot, and one student, not entirely serious, asked for a nearby pool for a restorative swim.\n\nRelated: 4 Really Strange Sleep Problems (You Could Have One)\n\nLast month, the university library started testing a MetroNaps EnergyPod (in English: a nap machine) that looks like a dental chair encased in a plastic egg and sells for just under $13,000. It can vibrate gently and wake you up slowly to soothing music.\n\nGoogle and several colleges have them. St. Leo College in Florida has installed them in dorms so commuters can use them and dorm-dwellers don\u2019t have to go all the way upstairs to take a nap.\n\nAfter all, what is college without a $13,000 vibrating nap machine?\n\nThis article originally appeared in Minding the Campus.\n\nRead more at Minding the Campus:\n\nGoucher to Students: No High School Transcript - No Problem!\n\nUVA Needs More Transparency on Affirmative Action\n\nStudents Must Agree \"Why\" They Had Sex - or It's Sexual Assault", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "This has been a big year for sleep at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.", "title": "Can You Get a Degree in Power Napping?", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/09/17/Can-You-Get-Degree-Power-Napping", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/06092014_Alarm_Wake_Up_Morning.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/09/17/Can-You-Get-Degree-Power-Napping", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/06092014_Alarm_Wake_Up_Morning.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "This has been a big year for sleep at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "These brief spells have been limited to 30 minutes, and the space, in a well-trafficked area on the first floor of Shapiro, was equipped with vinyl cots, disinfecting wipes, disposable pillowcases, and lockers.\nThis has been a big year for sleep at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.\nUVA Needs More Transparency on Affirmative ActionStudents Must Agree \"Why\" They Had Sex - or It's Sexual Assault\nRead more at Minding the Campus:Goucher to Students: No High School Transcript - No Problem!\nSt. Leo College in Florida has installed them in dorms so commuters can use them and dorm-dwellers don\u2019t have to go all the way upstairs to take a nap."}
