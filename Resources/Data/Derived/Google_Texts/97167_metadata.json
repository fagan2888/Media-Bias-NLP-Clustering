Does this figure include taxes and insurance too?\n\nYes, it does. Your housing payment should not exceed 25 percent of your monthly take-home pay on a 15-year, fixed-rate mortgage.\n\nWhen it comes to buying a house, the goal is not to live in the Taj Mahal or have something so expensive you end up being \u201chouse poor.\u201d When buying a home, especially for first-time homebuyers, you should look for something nice \u2014 in a decent area \u2014 that you can get paid off as quickly as possible.\n\nIt\u2019s really not a big deal if you cheat a couple of percentage points one way or the other. But 25 percent is a good rule of thumb to ensure you\u2019ll still have money left over to live on, save and invest.\n\nMy mom and dad took out a whole life insurance policy for me when I was born. The cash value is $2,500, and my husband and I want to cash it out and put the money toward paying off debt. We already have larger term life insurance policies in place, but I\u2019m worried that doing this will offend my parents. What should I do?\n\nI think the real question is how many toxic things will you do because you\u2019re afraid you might offend them. Whole life policies are financially toxic. They\u2019re a bad product, and keeping it for no better reason than it might hurt their feelings a little bit isn\u2019t much of a reason \u2014 especially when the alternative is paying down debt and getting your financial life in order.\n\nI know this is mom and dad we\u2019re talking about, so you\u2019ll have to be nice about everything. But at the same time, your parents have to realize it\u2019s your life and you make the decisions.\n\nTry sitting down with them and gently explaining that while you appreciate and love them for their generosity, you\u2019re going to cash it out and use it to get out of debt. Let them know you\u2019re not wasting their gift, and that you\u2019re using it to make a positive impact on your lives.\n\nYou\u2019re not doing anything disrespectful. Just be very clear about the reason and loving with your explanation. Then, if they choose to become a little emotional or resentful, that\u2019s on them.\n\nIf they get really upset and want the money back, you can do that too. But getting your financial house in order is much more important than hanging on to a bad financial product you don\u2019t need in the first place.\n\nDave Ramsey is a personal money management expert, author and national radio personality.
