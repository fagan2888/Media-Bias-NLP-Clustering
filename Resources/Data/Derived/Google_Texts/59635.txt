In this photo by Bullit Marquez, Aileen Tatualia hugs her only child, Prinz Leenbert, 5, whom she has not seen since he was 10 months old, shortly after she arrived home in the Philippines from Yemen. She was among 90 Filipinos in the first group of overseas workers repatriated from Yemen, hit by Saudi-led airstrikes the past two weeks. Millions of Filipinos work abroad, many in the Middle East, and the Philippine government often hails the workers as "new heroes." Hundreds more Filipinos are awaiting repatriation from Yemen.
