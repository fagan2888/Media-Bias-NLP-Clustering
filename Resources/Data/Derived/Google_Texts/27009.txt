The Montgomery County Sheriff Office says a 2-year-old Dearing, Kansas girl has died after she was discovered floating in a swimming pool late Sunday.

In a news release, Sheriff Robert Dierks says emergency services were notified at about 10 p.m. that the toddler was found in a pool near her home northwest of Coffeyville.

He stated Amber Santorella was discovered missing from her bedroom and after a search around her home, her family found the toddler in the pool.

Sheriff's deputies as well as Coffeyville EMS and Dearing firefighters responded to the scene and attempted to resuscitate the child. Amber was first taken to a Coffeyville hospital, then flown by medical helicopter to a Tulsa hospital.

The sheriff says Amber Santorella died Wednesday. He says his office is treating the drowning death as an accident.
