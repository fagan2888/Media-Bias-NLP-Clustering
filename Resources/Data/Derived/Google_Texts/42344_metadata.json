No, wait, I mean egos. After Andrea Smith was outed for the second time as being non-Native, several Native academics leapt to save her from scrutiny. \u201cFocus on more positive things,\u201d they said. \u201cLet\u2019s not criticize her, because she\u2019s done so much good for the community.\u201d I\u2019m done with that discourse. It\u2019s time to be upset. White people can all-to-easily say they\u2019re Indian, while claiming to be black is a cultural anomaly, ala Rachel Dolezal. It is with this in mind that I can say Andrea Smith is far more insidious a character than Dolezal.\n\nFor years Smith has been conjuring her fake spirit animal to cry wolf, acting like she\u2019s one of the many Indian women who face violence and subjugation. It\u2019s a little too generous to say Smith was lead to believe she was Indian. I mean, good lord, nobody told me I was an Indian. When my mom found out we were part Irish, she read a bunch of Irish literature, we made soda bread, and then called it a day. We couldn\u2019t get in touch with our Irish roots, because by lineage, blood, and community, we were too Indian. So Indian my mother put the Irish flag on regalia. So Indian, my mother argued Irish people should be called Indigenous because, just like us, they were exploited by the Europeans. How was Smith lead to believe she was Indian? Did she grow up in an Indian community? Nope. Are either of her parents Indian? Nope. She, like most white people who think they\u2019re Indian, was told she was part Indian. She took that and ran with it. Ran hard. Like, took that loose mouthed claim to lineage, and made a career out of it.\n\nTrust me, I empathize with people removed from their culture. The sixties scoop is a real issue for many Native people throughout North America. If you\u2019re unfamiliar, it was a period in which the government could scoop up Indian children from their communities, then place them up for adoption in Canada and the US. That\u2019s real: for the people disconnected from their cultures, and for the people who could not find their real parents. I empathize with Native people shut out from their culture, but don\u2019t confuse their stories with that of Smith. She\u2019s hella white, and she tried to save us. Can we call her what she is: a white savior.\n\nNative academic communities are far too kind. I\u2019ve seen endless blog posts and editorials empathizing with Smith. Even defending her, saying she\u2019s done so much good. No. Her deceit affected the ethos of every institution she worked for. Her criticism of government funding was coming from a dangerous space, where she never had to rely on government funding to feed her children or protect her sisters. She\u2019s a fake. Her work was based around her identity, and scholars have the audacity to say how she identifies isn\u2019t worth noting.\n\nSmith was a real spitfire and a hell-raiser. She wielded theory and residential school accounts verbatim. Her work was nothing more than the compiling of information, coupled with the intellect to unpack it. Her ideas aren\u2019t original. Lee Maracle, among other Native women, have been talking about environmental racism and the Indigenous female body for years. Smith is a smart lady. She can defend herself, even from the indefensible. See, white academics are really good at twisting words around, until Indians start doubting themselves. I\u2019m not trying to hear whatever argument defends her character.\n\nAndrea Smith doesn\u2019t know the struggle. She invented her own. Once a white professor took me aside to ask me how I felt about the stereotypes against Native women. I said, \u201cWhat stereotypes,\u201d because, up until then, I was happy to think I was an equal among my peers. He said, \u201cThe stereotype that you\u2019re wild women in bed. The \u2018Squaw\u2019 stereotype.\u201d I was shocked and speechless. I was never alone again with him. That\u2019s the struggle. Real threat. Real pain. Real discrimination.\n\nTerese Marie Mailhot is from Seabird Island, a place bound by the Mariah Slough and the Fraser River. She studies at the Institute of American Indian Arts.
