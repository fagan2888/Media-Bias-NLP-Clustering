Assemblyman John Wisniewski (D-19), chairman of Sanders\u2019 New Jersey campaign, and Democratic Vice-Chairwoman Lizette Delgado-Pelanco, a surrogate for Clinton, spoke at the kick-off. Delgado-Pelanco came out strong for both Norcross and the former Secretary of State.\n\n\u201cHillary Clinton will help build upon the legacy that President Obama has left, and she will also stop Republicans from undoing all of this president\u2019s wonderful accomplishments,\u201d Delgado-Pelanco said. \u201cShe will also protect and build our Obamacare.\u201d\n\nNorcross, for his part, said he would be just as happy with Clinton or Sanders as the nominee.\n\n\u201cOn the Democrat side what you see is, there\u2019s healthy debate. I think that\u2019s good, and we need to debate the issues,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are many times different solutions to the same problem, and that\u2019s what I think you\u2019re hearing both from Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton. I think each of them in their own right would make an excellent president.\u201d\n\nWisniewski did not mention Sanders in his remarks, instead praising Norcross\u2019 record as a former Assembly colleague and labor leader. Asked about Sanders\u2019 coalition in New Jersey and which county-level candidates might help get the word out before June\u2019s primary, Wisniewski said that many of those candidacies are formalities to get Sanders a more prominent position on county ballots. Sanders has his work cut out for him in New Jersey, where Clinton leads with 55 percent of respondents to Sanders\u2019 32 percent in the latest Rutgers-Eagleton poll.\n\n\u201cYou have to have a slate of county officers, so in nineteen counties, the Sanders campaign has individuals running as freeholders or in some cases as constitutional officers. But only for the purpose of being eligible to get a position on the ballot.\u201d\n\nNorcross\u2019 opponent, 25 year-old Sanders supporter Alex Law, criticized Wisniewski for treating county candidates as an afterthought by phone that same day. Law has latched on to Sanders\u2019 momentum among young voters and white progressives in his bid against Norcross for the CD1 seat. Law argued that the Sanders campaign here, under Wisniewski\u2019s leadership, has too often shied away from evaluating Norcross\u2019 record as a centrist with as many ties to the business community as the labor movement.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at how organized and how well Bernie\u2019s ground game has been in other states, I think it\u2019s been disappointing for a lot of folks here in New Jersey who want to see him do well in our state,\u201d Law said.\n\nSanders will need a radical reconfiguration in congress in order for ambitious plans for single-payer healthcare, student debt relief and re-regulation of banks to become more than campaign promises. That change, Wisniewski said, will come by eroding Republicans\u2019 majority to prevent obstruction in the House and Senate \u2014 not by pitting Democrats against one another.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think Donald Norcross is a problem for Senator Sanders, I think Scott Garret is and Frank LoBiondo and a lot of Republicans who really don\u2019t even see the benefit of considering other points of view,\u201d Wisniewski said. \u201cThose are the problems. And when we talk about President Sanders and we talk about him moving an agenda through, the problem isn\u2019t going to be because of any of our incumbent Democrats whether it\u2019s Frank Pallone, Bill Pascrell or Donald Norcross.\n\nClinton\u2019s recent charge that Sanders lacks Democratic bona fides as a former independent, he continued, \u201csmacks of desperation.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe has caucused with the Democrats for 30 or 35 years,\u201d Wisniewski said. \u201cWhen the Senate had a narrow margin, it was Senator Sanders as an independent caucusing with the Democrats that made a lot of the Democratic policy achievements possible.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "https://nyopolitickernj.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/screen-shot-2016-04-06-at-2-25-47-pm.png?w=50", "description": "At Norcross\u2019 campaign kick-off, Clinton dominates the discussion.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "New Jersey News, Politics, Opinion, and Analysis", "description": "At Norcross\u2019 campaign kick-off, Clinton dominates the discussion.", "title": "As Primary Rages, Clinton and Sanders Camps Come Out for Norcross", "url": "http://politickernj.com/2016/04/as-primary-rages-clinton-and-sanders-camps-come-out-for-norcross/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "https://nyopolitickernj.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/screen-shot-2016-04-06-at-2-25-47-pm.png?w=1200", "height": 887}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://nyopolitickernj.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/screen-shot-2016-04-06-at-2-25-47-pm.png?w=640"}, "site": "@PolitickerNJ", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@PolitickerNJ"}, "sailthru.date": "2016-04-06 13:35:18", "sailthru.title": "As Primary Rages, Clinton and Sanders Camps Come Out for Norcross", "fb": {"app_id": 710865528969413}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://politickernj.com/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico", "application-name": "New Jersey News, Politics, Opinion, and Analysis", "keywords": "donald norcross, alex law, john wisniewski, hillary clinton, bernie sanders", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PolitickerNJ", "published_time": "2016-04-06T18:35:18+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-06T18:35:18+00:00", "author": "http://wordpress.com/author/jt-aregood"}, "sailthru.description": "At Norcross\u2019 campaign kick-off, Clinton dominates the discussion.", "sailthru.image.full": "https://nyopolitickernj.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/screen-shot-2016-04-06-at-2-25-47-pm.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0", "news_keywords": "Donald Norcross, Alex Law, John Wisniewski, Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders"}, "article_summary": "Assemblyman John Wisniewski (D-19), chairman of Sanders\u2019 New Jersey campaign, and Democratic Vice-Chairwoman Lizette Delgado-Pelanco, a surrogate for Clinton, spoke at the kick-off.\n\u201cYou have to have a slate of county officers, so in nineteen counties, the Sanders campaign has individuals running as freeholders or in some cases as constitutional officers.\nCHERRY HILL \u2014 With Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders still fighting it out in the Democratic presidential primary, U.S. Representative Donald Norcross was still undeclared as his reelection campaign kicked off Wednesday.\n\u201cShe will also protect and build our Obamacare.\u201dNorcross, for his part, said he would be just as happy with Clinton or Sanders as the nominee.\nSanders has his work cut out for him in New Jersey, where Clinton leads with 55 percent of respondents to Sanders\u2019 32 percent in the latest Rutgers-Eagleton poll."}
