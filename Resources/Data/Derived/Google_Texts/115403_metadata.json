Marco Rubio (R-FL) and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (R) recently announced their plans for how they would repeal and replace Obamacare, joining Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal (R) as the only candidates in a crowded Republican field to provide specific policy proposals for replacing the Affordable Care Act.\n\nIn August, Rubio and Walker released their plans, which they say will return free-market principles to the health care industry by placing decision-making and spending powers in the hands of patients and their doctors.\n\nBoth plans propose to offer refundable tax credits to purchase health insurance, would allow consumers to purchase insurance across state lines, and would expand health savings accounts (HSA).\n\nRubio says he wants to create a refundable tax credit that would allow consumers to purchase insurance on the individual market, and he wants to reduce the employer-based tax exclusion gradually over a period of 10 years, until its value is equal to that of the tax credit.\n\nWalker\u2019s plan also proposes significant federal tax credits that would help people pay for insurance policies on the private market if they don\u2019t have employer-provided health insurance.\n\nPlans Follow Market Principles\n\nPeter Ferrara, a senior fellow for The Heartland Institute, says what he likes most about the two plans is they would provide freedom and choice for working people.\n\n\u201cThey get rid of the individual mandate and the employer mandate, under which the government tells people what insurance they have to buy, and they let people choose the health insurance they want in the marketplace,\u201d Ferrara said. \u201cPlus, the plans both help the uninsured with a universal health insurance tax credit that working people can use to buy whatever [plans] they prefer in the free market.\n\n\u201cThe plans also make health insurance a lot less expensive by getting rid of unnecessary Obamacare overregulation, including the mandates, and [they allow] health insurance to be sold across state lines, increasing competition,\u201d Ferrara said. \u201cOf course, I also like that both plans get rid of the Obamacare taxes.\u201d\n\nMerrill Matthews, a resident scholar with the Institute for Policy Innovation, says Walker\u2019s plan is a little more detailed than Rubio\u2019s and focuses on people without employer-based plans.\n\n\u201cRubio wants to give everyone a tax credit, which is similar to what John McCain\u2019s plan would have done, and it\u2019s the right thing to do,\u201d Matthews said. \u201cHowever, it\u2019s very difficult to explain to the public.\n\n\u201cRubio\u2019s plan also talks about expanding Medicare, but his problem is, how do you expand Medicare and pay for it?\u201d Matthews said.\n\nDefects in the Candidates\u2019 Plans\n\nTwila Brase, president and cofounder of the Citizens\u2019 Council for Health Freedom, says she likes that both candidates want to repeal Obamacare, but any replacement bill will have problems.\n\n\u201cA straight repeal of the law is relatively easy compared to the huge target that replacement presents,\u201d Brase said. \u201cThe only reason Obamacare passed is because there was one party in power with a presidential champion, to the point that the party in power didn\u2019t even read the bill, but a replacement plan would be carefully read, special interests would weigh in on every word, and in a divided Congress, the repeal might never happen because of disagreements among members of both parties and their donors.\u201d\n\nMatthews says it will take a lot of political courage to follow through on a campaign promise to repeal and replace Obamacare.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to say it on the campaign trail and another to actually do it, especially if they have to make a decision that will take away the Obamacare subsidies [currently given to] roughly seven million people and receive a lashing from the media and Democrats,\u201d Matthews said.\n\nBrase says Rubio\u2019s plan would retain too much government control over health care.\n\n\u201cRubio wants to strengthen Medicare and Medicaid,\u201d said Brase. \u201cHowever, if we want health freedom in our future, keeping Medicare in play will be an obstacle.\n\n\u201cMedicare and its 132,000 pages of regulations controls much of what happens in every exam room and at every beside,\u201d Brase said. \u201cI envision a Medicare-free society where we keep private health insurance or health sharing for a lifetime and charity retakes its vaunted place as part of the mission of medicine.\u201d\n\nProposing Block Grants\n\nMedicaid is addressed in both candidates\u2019 plans, Brase says.\n\n\u201cWalker has three block grants to states, which is interesting, and Rubio also has a per-capita block grant,\u201d Brase said. \u201cThat\u2019s a start, but the goal should be to get the federal government out of health care, to reduce federal taxes and controls as a result, and to open up real and competitive markets for health insurance, not just a cabal of federally endorsed or state-endorsed managed care corporations for all.\u201d\n\nJohn C. Goodman, a senior fellow at the Independent Institute and president of the Goodman Institute for Public Policy, says the biggest defect of the Walker plan is it\u2019s not really paid for.\n\n\u201c[Walker] abolishes Obamacare, which abolishes the revenues for Obamacare, then he wants to have a tax credit for people to buy their own insurance, but he has no way of paying for that,\u201d Goodman said.\n\nKenneth Artz (iamkenartz@hotmail.com) is managing editor of Health Care News.", "article_metadata": {}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd31ac\"", "article_summary": "Scott Walker (R) recently announced their plans for how they would repeal and replace Obamacare, joining Louisiana Gov.\n\u201cPlus, the plans both help the uninsured with a universal health insurance tax credit that working people can use to buy whatever [plans] they prefer in the free market.\nIn August, Rubio and Walker released their plans, which they say will return free-market principles to the health care industry by placing decision-making and spending powers in the hands of patients and their doctors.\nKenneth Artz (iamkenartz@hotmail.com) is managing editor of Health Care News.\n\u201cThe plans also make health insurance a lot less expensive by getting rid of unnecessary Obamacare overregulation, including the mandates, and [they allow] health insurance to be sold across state lines, increasing competition,\u201d Ferrara said."}
