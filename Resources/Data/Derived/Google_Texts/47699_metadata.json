And last year, the court ruled 9-0 in the case of a Lutheran Church employee that the Constitution bars the government from enforcing employment laws on behalf of anyone the church considers a minister.\n\nAt one time, conservatives on the court tended to side with the government in free-exercise fights. \u201cSome of the conservatives \u2014 including, especially Justice Scalia\u2026have not been sympathetic to religious exemptions from general laws,\u201d noted Cornell Law Professor Michael Dorf.\n\nScalia\u2019s 1990 opinion upholding the government\u2019s power to penalize an individual for using peyote \u2014 even when used in a religious ritual \u2014 triggered a strongly negative political reaction from the right and the left. That led to the passage in 1993 of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, a federal law that made it tougher for the government to take actions that intrude on religious practice.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Full health care policy coverage)\n\nThe left-right coalition persists to this day and can now be seen from time to time on the high court.\n\n\u201cDemocrats like minority religions because they\u2019re minorities and Republicans like them because they\u2019re religions,\u201d Dorf said. \u201cThe problem is when you\u2019re not asking for a small exception to a law nobody really cares about anyway, like one forbidding peyote use, but one about people paying their taxes.\u201d\n\nSince the passage of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, Scalia and some of the other conservative justices have seemed more open to religious claims. \u201cHe thinks the Constitution doesn\u2019t require a religious exemption of its own force, but all of them seem perfectly happy to find exemptions based on RFRA,\u201d Dorf added.\n\nWith scant indications of how relative newcomers to the court like Elena Kagan think about these issues, some are looking for clues earlier in the justices\u2019 lives and careers.\n\nWhen Kagan worked in the Clinton White House, she wrote an internal memo decrying the California Supreme Court\u2019s narrow interpretation of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. She called \u201cquite outrageous\u201d an opinion denying a landlord\u2019s claim that her religious beliefs were burdened by a state law that forced her to rent apartments to unmarried couples. \u201cTaken seriously, this kind of reasoning could strip RFRA of any real meaning,\u201d she warned.\n\n\u201cIt does suggest she is not likely to accept the government\u2019s argument that for-profit businesses are categorically unable to raise a free-exercise claim,\u201d McConnell said, while noting that the 1996 memo might not correctly capture her present views on the subject.\n\nMcConnell also remembers Kagan being receptive to religious freedom arguments in her days as lawyer and domestic policy adviser for President Bill Clinton. \u201cI do recall that those of us interested in enforcement of RFRA had reason to believe she was our friend and advocate within the White House,\u201d said McConnell, now a professor at Stanford Law School.\n\nCORRECTION: Corrected by: Kourtney Geers @ 01/04/2014 09:12 AM Correction: A previous version of this story misidentified David Gans.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "The cases could yield a broad left-right coalition of justices.", "title": "W.H. faces tough contraception fight", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/01/barack-obama-white-house-contraception-cases-obamacare-affordable-care-act-supreme-court-101740.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/01/03/140103_sotomayor_obama_kagan_aps_6052.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Barack Obama,Obamacare,Supreme Court,Contraception,White House,Affordable Care Act", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "The cases could yield a broad left-right coalition of justices.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "McConnell also remembers Kagan being receptive to religious freedom arguments in her days as lawyer and domestic policy adviser for President Bill Clinton.\nExperts pointed to two religious freedom cases the court has decided in the past decade, both of which wound up as abject defeats for the government.\nfaces tough contraception fightAs a new round of religion-based challenges to President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law head to the Supreme Court, advocates on both sides of the issue say the administration\u2019s arguments are likely facing a chilly reception.\nWhen Kagan worked in the Clinton White House, she wrote an internal memo decrying the California Supreme Court\u2019s narrow interpretation of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.\nStory Continued BelowAlready, the Supreme Court is preparing to hear two cases filed by private companies who say contraception provisions in the law violate their firms\u2019 rights to religious freedom."}
