Just try and stop her.\n\nThe screwball-comedy-meets-assassination-caper has become a flashpoint in debates about self-censorship, cybersecurity and corporate backbone ever since Sony Pictures seemingly put the movie on ice after hackers stole troves of confidential data and later threatened violence if the movie was released.\n\nMarinelli, whose parents emigrated from Russia to escape communism, said she wanted to see the movie as an act of defiance against the Sony hackers, who are believed to be acting on behalf of the communist government of North Korea.\n\n\"That's why my parents came to America in the first place,\" the Farmingdale woman said.\n\nMarinelli attended with Michael Kazmierczak and their son, also named Michael, who explained that the family also was big fans of the brand of comedy found in the movies of Seth Rogen and James Franco, the film's stars.\n\n\"Everything kind of fits together,\" he said.\n\nOnly 299 theaters nationwide agreed to show The Interview, well below the 3,000-screen threshold that marks a big studio movie's wide release. Marinelli went to the 5:10 p.m. showing at the Cine Grand Middlebrook 10, a newly refurbished first-run theater tucked behind a carpet and flooring store on Route 35 in Ocean.\n\nRelated: Where to see \"The Interview\" in New Jersey\n\nThe first two showings of the day were well attended, according to General manager Maurice Zuniga, who said they were \"not selling out, but close to it.\"\n\nZuniga told the Asbury Park Press that his theater sensed an opportunity to fill a void when the bigger chains announced they wouldn't be screening the film.\n\n\"We knew that a lot customers wanted to see it,\" he said. \"We're a company that's committed to attracting movies that our customers want to see.\"\n\nBuy Photo Cine Grand Middlebrook 10 in Ocean is one of just 299 theaters nationwide that agreed to screen the controversial comedy \u201cThe Interview\u201d on Christmas Day.

The cinema is scheduled to show the film five times per day through the weekend: 11:50 a.m., 2:35 p.m., 5:10 p.m., 7:45 p.m. and 10:20 p.m.\n\nRelated: Rogen, Franco celebrate the release of \"The Interview\"\n\nIn the movie, Franco and Rogen star as a talk show host and a producer, respectively, who are enlisted by the CIA to assassinate North Korea dictator Kim Jong Un.\n\nThe Interview was supposed to be the R-rated comedy option for moviegoers this holiday season, but it's place in history became something else when a group calling itself the \"Guardians of Peace\" infiltrated sensitive Sony data \u2014 which turned out to be anything from employees' Social Security numbers to embarassing emails to unreleased screenplays \u2014 on November 24.\n\nAt first, it was not publicly known what the hackers' motivation was until the group blamed the attack on \"the movie of terrorism\" \u2014 presumably referring to The Interview.\n\nSony pledged to push forward with a wide release until the hackers posted a threat online on Dec. 16 warning potential viewers to keep their distance from theaters that show the movie, invoking the memory of the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001 to make their point. Sony allowed theater owners to decide individually whether or not they would screen the movie, and the four largest chains elected not to.\n\nIn this photo illustration two tickets for the movie \"The Interview\" are seen in front of the Los Feliz 3 Cinema in Los Angeles, California on December 23, 2014, where \"The Interview\" is scheduled to be shown December 25, 2014. Some US independent cinemas said they will show the Sony Pictures film on Christmas Day, a dramatic U-turn after its decision to cancel the film following a cyber-assault blamed on North Korea.

Then on Tuesday, the film's stars announced that the film would still debut on Christmas Day, though on a much smaller scale than originally planned.\n\nThe 299 theaters that took a chance on The Interview were likely undercut somewhat by the deal Sony consumated Wednesday to make the film available for online streaming \u2014 for a fee \u2014 through certain websites.\n\nVideo: Sony made a mistake in pulling \"The Interview,\" Obama says\n\nRuss Zimmer: 732-557-5748, razimmer@app.com\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.app.com/1AOHNbr", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "The Cine Grand Middlebrook 10 in Ocean was one of only 299 theaters, and the only one in Monmouth and Ocean counties, to screen the controversial comedy The Interview on Christmas Day.", "og": {"site_name": "Asbury Park Press", "description": "The Cine Grand Middlebrook 10 in Ocean was one of only 299 theaters, and the only one in Monmouth and Ocean counties, to screen the controversial comedy The Interview on Christmas Day.", "title": "Local showings of", "url": "http://www.app.com/story/news/2014/12/25/ocean-theater-interview/20900399/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/app.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Cine Grand Middlebrook 10 in Ocean was one of only 299 theaters, and the only one in Monmouth and Ocean counties, to screen the controversial comedy The Interview on Christmas Day.", "title": "The Interview at CineGrand Middlebrook 10", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/dab110de8f479ee44c40dfe25f326b42ecc2566c/c=408-0-2856-2448&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/AsburyPark/2014/12/25/B9315638772Z.1_20141225191756_000_G9S9GUOPH.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@AsburyParkPress", "site": "@AsburyParkPress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600068887", "fb": {"app_id": 116172675120111}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/russ.zimmer.3"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "The Interview, interview, movies, new jersey, nj, middlebrook 10, movie theater"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc354\"", "article_summary": "(Photo: Staff photo/Russ Zimmer)Buy PhotoNatalie Marinelli was determined to see \"The Interview,\" a comedy that's been surrounded by sobering conversation.\nBuy Photo Cine Grand Middlebrook 10 in Ocean is one of just 299 theaters nationwide that agreed to screen the controversial comedy \u201cThe Interview\u201d on Christmas Day.\nThe Cine Grand Middlebrook 10 in Ocean is one of just 299 theaters nationwide to show the movie on Christmas Day.\nVideo: Sony made a mistake in pulling \"The Interview,\" Obama saysRuss Zimmer: 732-557-5748, razimmer@app.comRead or Share this story: http://on.app.com/1AOHNbr\nOnly 299 theaters nationwide agreed to show The Interview, well below the 3,000-screen threshold that marks a big studio movie's wide release."}
