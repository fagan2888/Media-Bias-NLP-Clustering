At home in their districts, you can imagine hearing, \u201cour democracy is strong because it reflects the interests of the people! Our government in Washington is responsive and accountable to you!\u201d\n\n\n\nWhat these members of Congress do not say out loud is: \u201cunless you are an African American or Latina woman, qualified and enrolled in Medicaid, living in the District of Columbia,\u201d - in that case the rules are different.\n\n\n\nFor a woman living in D.C. struggling to get by and considering ending a pregnancy, then it\u2019s not about her being able to make the decision that is best for her and her family. It\u2019s not about her being able to access all possible options so she can best guarantee her health, safety, and dignity.\n\n\n\n\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHer ability and freedom to make important, life-altering medical decisions are no longer personal ones, but instead political \u2013 decisions some politicians in Congress want to - and in fact do - control.Every year, Congress passes the Hyde Amendment and withholds federal funding for insurance coverage of abortion for low-income women. Thankfully, each of the fifty states can decide to use state funds to cover this important care\u2014but things work differently in the District of Columbia.Even though the District, with its more than 600,000 residents, is supposed to have home rule, Congress prevents D.C.\u2019s locally elected officials from making internal decisions about how to spend their health care funds.And so in the national political struggle over abortion, those in Congress frustrated by their inability to limit every woman\u2019s personal health care decisions have made an example of women in the District of Columbia by denying them Medicaid coverage for abortion services. It doesn\u2019t matter that D.C. officials and residents have fought to cover these services.It\u2019s the worst kind of governance, playing politics with something as important as a woman\u2019s personal decision-making.Just as disturbing as politicians\u2019 willingness to interfere in our personal decision-making is the disproportionate impact on women of color. In fact, a whopping 94 percent of Washingtonians who are affected by the Congressional ban on abortion coverage are people of color.In his recent budget, President Obama showed his commitment to ending the District of Columbia\u2019s abortion ban. It\u2019s now up to Congress to act. Our optimism mostly lies in the Senate, as the House Appropriations Committee this week voted down an amendment to remove the ban. Hopefully this year, we can put national politics aside, focus on the best interests of the low-income women in the District of Columbia and bring an end to the D.C. Medicaid abortion ban.Living in our nation\u2019s capital should mean that a woman can have access to what she needs for critical pregnancy-related health care, however much money she makes. We must stand with D.C. women and demand a government that is accountable and responsive.It\u2019s time for politicians in Congress to bring their lofty promises of freedom, and democracy, and human dignity beyond the marble halls of Congress and into the communities outside.That\u2019s a principle we should all be able to embrace.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Many members of Congress have a well-worn stump speech on the importance of individual liberty and the greatness of our American representational government.", "description": "Many members of Congress have a well-worn stump speech on the importance of individual liberty and the greatness of our American representational government.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Congress Blog"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Many members of Congress have a well-worn stump speech on the importance of individual liberty and the greatness of our American representational government.", "title": "End the DC abortion ban", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/healthcare/319705-end-the-dc-abortion-ban", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-03T01:12:04-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-03T01:12-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/healthcare/319705-end-the-dc-abortion-ban", "dcterms.date": "2013-09-02T16:00-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Joe Picard", "author": "Eleanor Hinton Hoytt and Jessica Gonz\u00e1lez-Rojas", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-02T16:00:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-03T01:12:04-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/healthcare/319705-end-the-dc-abortion-ban", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Many members of Congress have a well-worn stump speech on the importance of individual liberty and the greatness of our American representational government.", "card": "summary", "title": "End the DC abortion ban"}, "dcterms.title": "End the DC abortion ban"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcac84\"", "article_summary": "In fact, a whopping 94 percent of Washingtonians who are affected by the Congressional ban on abortion coverage are people of color.In his recent budget, President Obama showed his commitment to ending the District of Columbia\u2019s abortion ban.\nOur optimism mostly lies in the Senate, as the House Appropriations Committee this week voted down an amendment to remove the ban.\nAt home in their districts, you can imagine hearing, \u201cour democracy is strong because it reflects the interests of the people!\nIt\u2019s not about her being able to access all possible options so she can best guarantee her health, safety, and dignity.\nTheir constituents no doubt hear their proclamations during town hall meetings, ribbon cuttings, and every-other-year campaign events."}
