The site reportedly partnered with the progressive foreign policy-related nonprofit New Security Action and liberal advocacy organization MoveOn to produce the bit.\n\nThe reason for going to a comedy website to promote a nuclear deal seems obvious: \u201cThe question was: How can we reach as many people as possible, beyond the so-called Beltway?\u201d New Security Action co-founder Tom Andrews told the Daily Beast. \u201cSo we talked to the Funny or Die people, and we talked about what the options might be. How could they use humor, something to get traction on social media.\u201d\n\nFunny or Die was also behind the now-infamous \u201cBetween Two Ferns\u201d interview with President Obama, in which comedian and Hangover star Zach Galifianakis poked and prodded the president over the Affordable Care Act, which was struggling to attract sign-ups shortly after its disastrous rollout.\n\nMike Farah, president of production at Funny or Die, told the Daily Beast that the website\u2019s D.C. outpost was a direct result of its work in Washington with political groups, and the success of the Obama skit prompted him to think about the bigger picture.\n\n\u201cOur biggest branded entertainment client of all time was the White House,\u201d Farah told the outlet. \u201cSo I started daydreaming about what if we did try to make this an official thing. Not for the White House, because the White House has no money. But for people in the world of politics, especially with the election coming up, I felt it was a natural evolution.\u201d\n\nWhile Bush communications director Miller stressed that there are currently \u201cno plans on the books\u201d to work with the site, the candidate could probably stand to benefit from some social/new/online/\u201dcool\u201d media exposure; Bush\u2019s raffling off of free Late Show tickets prompted some not-so-good-natured ribbing from host Stephen Colbert earlier this month.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jeb Bush's presidential campaign has explored partnering with the traditionally GOP-hostile comedy website Funny or Die.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Jeb Bush's presidential campaign has explored partnering with the traditionally GOP-hostile comedy website Funny or Die.", "title": "Jeb Bush Open to Working with GOP Haters 'Funny or Die' - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/09/Jeb-Getty2.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-hollywood/2015/09/20/jeb-bush-open-working-gop-haters-funny-die/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Jeb Bush's presidential campaign has explored partnering with the traditionally GOP-hostile comedy website Funny or Die.", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/09/Jeb-Getty2.jpg", "title": "Jeb Bush Open to Working with GOP Haters 'Funny or Die' - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Between Two Ferns, Funny or Die, Jeb Bush, Prop 8: The Musical, The Dealbreakers, Will Ferrell,2016 Presidential Race, Big Hollywood,Funny", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "Will Ferrell", "published_time": "2015-09-20T13:44:18-07:00", "categories": "Big Hollywood,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfb07\"", "article_summary": "Not for the White House, because the White House has no money.\n\u201cOur biggest branded entertainment client of all time was the White House,\u201d Farah told the outlet.\n\u201cSo we talked to the Funny or Die people, and we talked about what the options might be.\nThe site reportedly partnered with the progressive foreign policy-related nonprofit New Security Action and liberal advocacy organization MoveOn to produce the bit.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve definitely gotten interest from groups and campaigns that are not progressive,\u201d Jenkins said."}
