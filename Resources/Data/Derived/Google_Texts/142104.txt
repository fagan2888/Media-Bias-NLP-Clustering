2 transported to NCMC with serious injuries

A 19-year-old Cheyenne, Wyo., man died Sunday morning in an accident on Colo. 61 that seriously injured two others.

The driver of a 2003 Pontiac Grand Am, identified by the Colorado State Patrol as Austin W. Robertson, died at the scene of the collision with a horse, according to the accident report. The accident occurred at 2:45 a.m. as the vehicle was traveling south on the highway approaching County Road 12; the horse was standing in the southbound lane.

After the collision, the car ran off the left side of the road and continued south across C.R. 12, coming to a stop on its wheels facing south in a dirt field on the southeast corner of the intersection.

The two passengers in vehicle suffered serious injuries in the accident, the CSP report stated. Jonathan Waller, 20, of Sterling, was transported to Sterling Regional MedCenter by ambulance, then airlifted to North Colorado Medical Center in Greeley. Nineteen-year-old Sharaika Clawson of Yuma was also flown to NCMC.

The horse initially laid in the northbound lane, then stumbled off the roadway and into the grassy ditch on the east side of the highway. It was euthanized due to its injuries.

The accident report says neither speed nor the use of alcohol or drugs is suspected in the accident. No one in the vehicle was using a seat belt.
