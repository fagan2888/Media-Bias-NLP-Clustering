The wife of a Kansas bail bondsman charged with abusing his missing 7-year-old son said she suspected her husband was plotting to kill her and the other children living in the home.

In interviews with The Associated Press, Heather Jones alleged that her husband abused her and the boy, Adrian, who is now missing. She also said he was armed with several assault weapons when he was arrested.

The remains of a juvenile were found at a barn on the property when police went there last week to investigate a domestic disturbance. Six girls from age 10 to less than 2 were taken from the home and are in state custody.

Michael A. Jones was charged Monday with child abuse, aggravated battery and aggravated assault with a firearm.
