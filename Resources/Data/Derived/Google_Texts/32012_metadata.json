And his foot appears fine.\n\nLast season, the middle linebacker led the Broncos in tackles with 113 despite hobbling to the finish line. He sat out the last two games but returned for the Broncos\u2019 divisional playoff loss to the Indianapolis Colts.\n\nHe now has two screws in his foot \u2014 and some minor pain that comes with them \u2014 and will have to leave the screws in for the remainder of this season. But he was ahead of schedule with his rehab during training camp and is back on the field, playing a crucial role in Wade Phillips\u2019 3-4 defense.\n\nAlthough Jack Del Rio\u2019s 4-3 alignment last season implemented some principles of the 3-4, Marshall\u2019s duties as the strongside linebacker changed.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still trying to learn all the ins and outs, but I think I have a pretty decent grasp on it,\u201d Marshall said. \u201cOnce I do (get more reps), I\u2019ll be able to make plays.\u201d\n\nThis is only the preseason, but for Marshall, Saturday\u2019s showing offered a measuring stick of his physical progress. It was a show of his comfort in Phillips\u2019 system. And it was a message of his comfort in the system.\n\n\u201cI felt good,\u201d he said after the game. \u201cObviously you want to improve on everything or some things each week. I thought I could have played against the run a little better, but I thought I did well against the pass. I just want to keep getting better, and as my foot keeps feeling better, I think I\u2019ll play better.\u201d\n\nIt also was a sign that the fourth-year pro is back where he feels most at home. On the field. Racking up tackles.\n\nNicki Jhabvala: njhabvala@denverpost.com or twitter.com/nickijhabvala", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Brandon Marshall gets his foot back in the door with Broncos", "title": "Brandon Marshall gets his foot back in the door with Broncos", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/08/22/brandon-marshall-gets-his-foot-back-in-the-door-with-broncos/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150822_084351_brandon-marshall.jpg", "height": 470}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150822_084351_brandon-marshall.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-22T20:42:04+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T05:12:02+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda3c2\"", "article_summary": "HOUSTON \u2014 Brandon Marshall was not among the Broncos\u2019 contingent who experienced a Houston homecoming Saturday night.\nLast season, the middle linebacker led the Broncos in tackles with 113 despite hobbling to the finish line.\nHe was undoubtedly the brightest spot in an otherwise sloppy first quarter for Denver, wreaking havoc quickly and efficiently.\nI thought I could have played against the run a little better, but I thought I did well against the pass.\nHe sat out the last two games but returned for the Broncos\u2019 divisional playoff loss to the Indianapolis Colts."}
