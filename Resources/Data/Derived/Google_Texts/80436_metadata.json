So I think that undercuts the assertion that that is not a meaningful development.\"\n\nCarney went on to cite the American Legion nine times during the briefing.\n\nThe White House explained that Carney was directly quoting from newspaper accounts citing the commander of the American Legion's reaction to Petzel's resignation.\n\nBut the American Legion put out a statement on Friday about Dr. Petzel's resignation saying almost exactly the opposite of what Carney suggested.\n\n\"This move by VA is not a corrective action, but a continuation of business as usual,\" American Legion National Commander Daniel M. Dellinger said in a statement. \"Dr. Petzel was already scheduled to retire this year, so his resignation now really won't make that much of a difference.\"\n\nThe statement - which can be found on the at the top of the American Legion's website - goes on to say the real problem is at the top of VA. \"Secretary [Eric] Shinseki and Under Secretary [Allison] Hickey remain on the job. They are both part of VA's leadership problem, and we want them to resign as soon as possible.\"\n\nWhen asked about the discrepancy, the White House pointed ABC News to articles in the Washington Times and USA Today that posted on Friday and quoted American Legion officials calling the resignation a \"step towards addressing the leadership problem at the VA.\"\n\nThe official quoted, spokesman John Raughter, acknowledged saying it was a step forward but not much of a step.\n\n\"It was a small a step,\" Raughter told ABC News. \"It was going to happen anyway. So, I suppose it was better than if he had stayed on the job.\"\n\nWas Raughter suggesting the problems at the VA had been addressed in a significant way?\n\n\"Not at all,\" he said. \"We feel there is a cultural change that needs to be made.\"\n\nAs for the way the White House has cited the group, American Legion spokesman Peter Gayton told ABC News, \"We hope they read the commander's full release on Dr. Petzel's resignation.\"", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "White House Distorts American Legion Statement on Veterans Controversy", "description": "White House Distorts American Legion Statement on Veterans Controversy", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 ABC News Internet Ventures", "author": "ABC News", "og": {"url": "http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2014/05/white-house-distorts-american-legion-statement-on-veterans-controversy/", "site_name": "ABC News", "description": "Press secretary repeatedly suggested the group praised a recent VA resignation.", "title": "White House Distorts American Legion Statement on Veterans Controversy"}, "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"admins": 704409894, "app_id": 4942312939}, "keywords": "politics news, election news, political news, political news articles", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde60d\"", "article_summary": "The White House explained that Carney was directly quoting from newspaper accounts citing the commander of the American Legion's reaction to Petzel's resignation.\nCarney went on to cite the American Legion nine times during the briefing.\nIt turns out, however, the American legion had issued a statement dismissing the resignation as \"business as usual.\"\nAs for the way the White House has cited the group, American Legion spokesman Peter Gayton told ABC News, \"We hope they read the commander's full release on Dr. Petzel's resignation.\"\nBut the American Legion put out a statement on Friday about Dr. Petzel's resignation saying almost exactly the opposite of what Carney suggested."}
