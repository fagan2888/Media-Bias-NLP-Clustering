Speaking at the 16th annual Not-for-Profit Health Care Investor Conference yesterday, Gary Brock, president and chief operating officer of the North Texas division, said that quality and population health efforts yielded $21 million in savings.\n\nAll of the executives presenting at this meeting, which is sponsored by Citi, the American Hospital Association and the Healthcare Financial Management Association, detailed their efforts to advance population health management strategies. Universally, they said that they couldn\u2019t afford to sit on their heels as the world rapidly changes.\n\n\u201cWe are striving to be the disrupters, not to be disrupted,\u201d said Joel Allison, CEO of Baylor Scott & White, adding that the organization is \u201call in on population health.\u201d\n\nEven at institutions that don\u2019t posses the enviable balance sheets of an Ascension or Advocate Health Care, population health is seen as a necessary investment. Leaders from Temple University Health System, located in the heart of Philadelphia and challenged to meet the needs of a high-acuity patient base, described how they\u2019ve instituted a variety of population health initiatives aimed at better connecting with patients and advancing healthier outcomes. Among the strategies: care management and risk stratification, medical neighborhoods, network alliances and partnerships and a robust health IT system.\n\nI had the chance to catch up with Charles Kennedy, M.D., chief population health officer, Healthagen, a subsidiary of insurance company Aetna, who offered his perspective on how providers and insurers can effectively move closer to population health management.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Some of the nations most forward-thinking leaders shared thoughts on moving toward population health and responding to consumerism at the Not-for-Profit Health Care Investor Conference.", "csrf-token": "PUif/55QIjBy4jW9qEWB1pjPRuGD85BGGgzUg+t2Q7Q=", "twitter": {"image": "http://www.hhnmag.com/ext/resources/inc-hhn/img/articles/article_images/2015/June/pophealth_190x127.jpg?1448315759", "description": "Some of the nation's most forward-thinking leaders shared thoughts on moving toward population health and responding to consumerism at the Not-for-Profit Health Care Investor Conference.", "card": "summary", "title": "Health Systems Are Jumping into Population Health"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "og": {"image": "http://www.hhnmag.com/ext/resources/inc-hhn/img/articles/article_images/2015/June/pophealth_190x127.jpg?1448315759", "type": "Article", "description": "Some of the nation's most forward-thinking leaders shared thoughts on moving toward population health and responding to consumerism at the Not-for-Profit Health Care Investor Conference.", "title": "Health Systems Are Jumping into Population Health"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/images/favicons/favicon-144.png", "keywords": "citi, not-for-profit health care, health care investors, rating agencies, Moodies, S&P, hospital finances", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "I had the chance to catch up with Charles Kennedy, M.D., chief population health officer, Healthagen, a subsidiary of insurance company Aetna, who offered his perspective on how providers and insurers can effectively move closer to population health management.\nSpeaking at the 16th annual Not-for-Profit Health Care Investor Conference yesterday, Gary Brock, president and chief operating officer of the North Texas division, said that quality and population health efforts yielded $21 million in savings.\nAmong the strategies: care management and risk stratification, medical neighborhoods, network alliances and partnerships and a robust health IT system.\nAll of the executives presenting at this meeting, which is sponsored by Citi, the American Hospital Association and the Healthcare Financial Management Association, detailed their efforts to advance population health management strategies.\nLeaders from Temple University Health System, located in the heart of Philadelphia and challenged to meet the needs of a high-acuity patient base, described how they\u2019ve instituted a variety of population health initiatives aimed at better connecting with patients and advancing healthier outcomes."}
