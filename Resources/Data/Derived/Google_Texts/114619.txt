Like weekends? Thank a liberal (Photo: Creative Commons )

EDITOR: When did the term liberal become a pejorative?

What have liberals ever done for us?

To start, our country was started by liberals. If the conservatives had had their way, it would have been the American revolt instead of the American Revolution and we would have continued to be a part of England.

The first 10 Amendments to our Constitution which enumerate the liberties we hold so dear is also something we can thank liberals for.

In addition, liberals have been responsible for many other liberties which the conservatives were against. Such things as child labor laws; the right of women to vote; trust busting; equal rights for the sexes and races; Social Security and on and on.

The purpose of this is not to say that everything liberals espouse is good and what the conservative are for is not good. The purpose is to point out that people should not be swayed by politicians who use labels in a way to demean their opposition. Look beyond the labels to see which candidate you prefer. You will find that you will not agree with everything which any candidate is for and you need to determine which issues are the ones that are more important to the country.
