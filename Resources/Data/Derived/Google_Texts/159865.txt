‘Netanyahu Has Announced A War On Al-Aqsa’

Raed Saleh, leader of the Islamic Movement in Israel, blamed the Israeli occupation for its “aggressive” measures as it keeps provoking Palestinians and Muslims. He described what the Jerusalemites are doing at Al-Aqsa Mosque as a “duty” towards the holy city, calling for all to join them.

Middle East Monitor– Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had declared a war on Al-Aqsa Mosque, and his desecration of the Islamic holy site is the start of the last phase of his plan to partition it, Al-Resalah reported the leader of the Islamist Movement in Israel Sheikh Raed Salah saying yesterday.

Salah told the paper that Al-Aqsa Mosque is witnessing a “real state of war” launched by the Israeli occupation in order to demolish it, stressing that Israel is finalising the partitioning plan, which was imposed on the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron decades ago.

He described this as a “dangerous indication” that puts the Islamic and Arabic identity of the city at stake. “This also undermines the existence of the mosque,” he added.

“There is a widespread tension at Al-Aqsa Mosque and its surroundings. This will not be limited to the holy city, but it will affect the whole world,” he warned. This situation ushers in a new “real intifada” that will undermine the security of the whole region.
