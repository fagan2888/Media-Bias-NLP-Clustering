The good news: It’s raining, and we do need the rain. The better news: It’s not icing, at least in most of the Dallas-Fort Worth area.

Now, way out west — in Comanche, Cooke, Eastland and Jack counties — there are reports of icing on bridges and overpasses. But west of Dallas-Fort Worth, temperatures are a few degrees colder — in the upper 20s, as opposed to the low to mid-30s being reported west of Interstate 35, the wintry-weather dividing line this New Year’s Day.

“It seems we’re seeing more impact when it’s 28 or lower, and that’s far to the west of the metro,” says Amanda Schroeder, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Fort Worth. “We’ve got a very stout, thick warm layer above the surface, which has helped keep temperatures a little warmer, which has helped keep things liquid.”

And it’s not going to get any colder — today or tonight.

“The temperature should remain fairly steady this morning and climb a little this afternoon,” she says, “and we’re not expecting freezing temperatures here during the overnight hours.” In fact, we’re not supposed to dip below freezing again until Saturday night, when lows are projected to drop into the low 30s as another shot of cold air arrives just in time for Cowboys-Lions. Says Schroeder, “You may have a little freezing rain mixed in there this morning in Dallas, but it shouldn’t be enough to cause any impacts.”

The rain’s likely to stick around until Saturday morning — the first small hint of good news in the new year, as we struggle to make a dent in a drought now entering its sixth year. As of 9 this morning, Dallas/Fort Worth International has received almost a quarter of an inch of the wet stuff.

Says Schroder, “A good way to start the year.”
