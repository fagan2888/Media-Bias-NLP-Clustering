Yet we hate umbrellas and stubbornly never carry them. The rain inevitably comes, so many of us get wet.\n\nAs I travel the country attending health care conferences, the mere mention of high-deductible health plans (HDHPs) raises hackles. People instantly start opining that HDHPs are a terrible idea, or a great idea, or both. These debates, while interesting, divert attention from an unalterable fact: HDHPs are rapidly becoming the plans of choice \u2014 for employers, for other purchasers of health benefits, and for public sector plans offered through state exchanges under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). In short, HDHPs have unleashed forces that will compel stakeholders to adjust to new realities \u2014 and everyone will get wet.\n\nA Primer on High-Deductible Plans\n\nHDHPs are typically defined as plans with deductibles that exceed $1,200 for individuals or $2,400 for families. Employers often pair HDHPs with a tax-protected health savings account (HSA) that helps employees meet the deductible or, if they remain healthy, pocket the money as savings. According to the 2014 Employer Benefits Survey from the Kaiser Family Foundation/Health Research & Educational Trust (HRET), the average deductible for individual coverage paired with an HSA is $2,098 \u2014 but 18% of workers have a deductible of $3,000 or more. For family coverage, deductibles average $4,059, and almost a third of covered workers have an aggregate deductible of at least $5,000. People enrolled in HDHPs pay for every dime of their care until they reach the deductible (with the exception of certain preventive services that plans are required to cover). That means the whole price for the MRI, the entire emergency room visit, and so on.\n\nThis makes for a potentially dramatic shift in patient behavior and thinking. In traditional plans, even if you have a deductible, you skim to the section of the bill that says \u201cpatient responsibility.\u201d It\u2019s usually a nice, round copay like $25 or $50 \u2014 the same predictable amount regardless of which services you received. In contrast, with an HDHP, the whole bill is yours to pay.\n\nHDHPs are not a new idea. Research by Harvard Business School\u2019s Regina Herzlinger and others began decades ago, and the George W. Bush administration fought successfully for employers to offer this option. Although the Bush policy was decidedly GOP-led, the Democrat-inspired ACA greatly accelerated the adoption of HDHPs, as new state exchanges usually feature high-deductible options.\n\nEven more influential is the so-called \u201cCadillac tax,\u201d set to take effect in 2018, which imposes a 40% excise tax on the value of health insurance benefits that exceed a certain threshold, starting with $10,200 for individuals and $27,500 for families. Employers are determined to avoid that tax, but that means slowing growth now, or risk blowing the cap by 2018. Employers used to hesitate to launch unpopular cost-cutting strategies like HDHPs so that they would remain competitive with plans offered by other employers. But pressure from the looming Cadillac tax is felt by all employers equally, so taking a risk on cost-cutting strategies now has less of a competitive disadvantage.\n\nAccording to the Kaiser HRET survey\u2014 the definitive source on plans and options offered by purchasers \u2014 one in five workers had an HDHP in 2013, up from nearly zero in 2006. Half of all firms with more than 5,000 workers now offer HDHPs.\n\nThe Economic Impact of HDHPs\n\nIn January 2014, federal actuaries released their annual report on U.S. health spending; it documented relatively slow, stable increases in 2012. This may sound boring, but it should be shocking, in light of our nation\u2019s history of \u201ccrisis level\u201d cost escalations. The actuaries state that the ACA had nothing to do with this slowdown in cost growth \u2014 they specifically credit the influence of HDHPs. And hospitals are feeling the pinch. An August report from Moody\u2019s shows a slowdown in hospital revenue, which it attributes to the popularity of HDHPs.\n\nDespite this finger-pointing at high-deductible health plans, it\u2019s generally rare for analysts to cite them as culprits in emerging health trends. But hospital leaders have told me that the well-documented growth of hospital debt is, in part, explained by the phenomenon of patients exhausting their unaffordable deductibles soon after being admitted for care. In many cases, the patient is still responsible for a portion of the remaining bill and cannot afford the out-of-pocket maximums, so the hospital doesn\u2019t get fully paid.\n\nThis bleeding from the hospitals\u2019 bottom lines will prompt uncomfortable changes in the way they do business, far beyond beefing up collections processes. Hospitals will need to incorporate pricing into conversations with patients about treatment options. And price-conscious patients, questioning the expensive inefficiencies that are rampant in health care, will not tolerate absurdly opaque and confusing hospitals bills for much longer. In effect, hospital CFOs will increasingly find themselves involved in clinical operations.\n\nThere\u2019s also an unprecedented national movement afoot for price transparency. The state of Massachusetts has passed legislation requiring providers to disclose prices to patients in advance of delivering services. So, as patients pay more of their bills themselves, ensuring their satisfaction is no longer a soft PR strategy, but a hardcore financial growth industry for providers. Accordingly, health systems are increasing their focus on patient- and family-centered care, creating new positions like \u201cchief experience officer.\u201d\n\nHow to Weather the Storms of Change\n\nHigh-deductible health plans are clearly setting big changes in motion. Here\u2019s how various stakeholders can cope with new realities instead of turning a blind eye:\n\nProviders need to prioritize transparency by giving newly activated consumers the information on price and quality that they demand. They also need to keep up the good work on shifting to patient-centered care models. Once and for all, fix those confusing hospital bills!\n\nneed to prioritize transparency by giving newly activated consumers the information on price and quality that they demand.

Policymakers must move beyond old partisan truisms and take a cold, hard look at the emerging evidence. For instance, policymakers must remove laws that impose rigid barriers to transparency, such as those that protect Joint Commission and other accreditation reports from public scrutiny. Contrary to conventional wisdom, these laws were never handed down from Mt. Sinai and have little justification.\n\nmust move beyond old partisan truisms and take a cold, hard look at the emerging evidence. For instance, policymakers must remove laws that impose rigid barriers to transparency, such as those that protect Joint Commission and other accreditation reports from public scrutiny. Contrary to conventional wisdom, these laws were never handed down from Mt. Sinai and have little justification. Employers need to adopt innovative strategies that empower workers to use information about price and quality to safely navigate the health system. Many health plans and companies, such as Castlight, have used online tools to enable consumers to easily find out what a particular service costs at a variety of providers. Still, these tools are not nearly as sophisticated as search engines that consumers use for other goods and services, in part because significant chunks of information on cost remain unavailable.\n\nFortunately, some leaders are already taking action. An executive at a successful, large company recently told me how her firm adapted its HDHP to fully cover pharmaceuticals and certain kinds of ongoing care, such as diabetes support. And they are seeing good results even at this early stage, including better use of primary care instead of emergency rooms by people with diabetes.\n\nThe Business Roundtable, representing Fortune 1000 CEOs, has issued a much-discussed report on corporations\u2019 innovations to improve transparency about provider quality and pricing. In addition to offering toolkits, videos, and personalized support for employees, some go farther. For instance, Honeywell\u2019s second-opinion service, called Surgery Decision Support, gives employees access to information and expertise to help them weigh their options related to possible surgical treatment. Honeywell finds that one in five participants in the service opt not to undergo surgery, and 98% of employees are satisfied with the program.\n\nHDHPs represent one of the most significant changes in our health care system since Medicare. They may not be perfect, but complaining about them won\u2019t change the realities we\u2019re already facing and those that are coming soon. It\u2019s time that leaders embraced the facts, the opportunities, and the hazards of high-deductible health plans.", "article_metadata": {"page-category-name": "Innovation", "msapplication-config": "none", "viewport": "initial-scale=1,width=device-width", "description": "How to adjust to a new reality.", "og": {"site_name": "Harvard Business Review", "description": "How to adjust to a new reality.", "title": "Don\u2019t Bother Complaining About High-Deductible Health Plans", "url": "https://hbr.org/2014/11/dont-bother-complaining-about-high-deductible-health-plans", "image": "https://hbr.org/resources/images/hbr_opengraph_940x490.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2014/11/2014NOV14-11.jpg", "site": "@harvardbiz", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@harvardbiz"}, "ox-group": 537063787, "item-name": "Don\u2019t Bother Complaining About High-Deductible Health Plans", "page-id": 300, "article-content-type": "Digital Article", "rr-placements": "item_page.articles,item_page.top_right,item_page.bottom,item_page.red_strip,item_page.subscribe_now,item_page.topbar_subscribe,item_page.mag_cover,item_page.subscribe,item_page.article_slider,item_page.exit_popup_slider", "page-category-id": 1565, "shopper-attributes": "state:guest", "sid": "07715F3D0A987242F294150304B08CDF", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/HBR", "published_time": "2014-11-13T15:57:52Z", "author": "Leah Binder", "section": "Innovation", "modified_time": "2014-12-19T23:56:51Z", "tag": "Health"}, "page-type": "ITEM", "item-id": "tag:blogs.harvardbusiness.org,2007-03-31:999.46908", "uid": "eda3825441070ed2f2ed693b069eb7e4"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe340c\"", "article_summary": "As I travel the country attending health care conferences, the mere mention of high-deductible health plans (HDHPs) raises hackles.\nDespite this finger-pointing at high-deductible health plans, it\u2019s generally rare for analysts to cite them as culprits in emerging health trends.\nIt\u2019s time that leaders embraced the facts, the opportunities, and the hazards of high-deductible health plans.\nMany health plans and companies, such as Castlight, have used online tools to enable consumers to easily find out what a particular service costs at a variety of providers.\nAnd price-conscious patients, questioning the expensive inefficiencies that are rampant in health care, will not tolerate absurdly opaque and confusing hospitals bills for much longer."}
