Richard Burr (R). Reelected in 2010 with 55% of the vote, Burr has become an influential lawmaker of the center right. His committee assignments include Finance and Health, Education, Labor and Pensions. He also chairs the Select Committee on Intelligence.\n\nNevertheless, Burr has three challengers running against him in the Republican Primary, and while he is heavily favored, he cannot take renomination for granted.\n\n\u201cA lot depends on the presidential election in North Carolina,\u201d says the journalist. The Senate primary coincides with the presidential primary and the turnout is likely to be larger than usual. If Donald Trump is still riding high, his voters could give a significant boost to Burr\u2019s opponents. Or if the turnout is large across the GOP\u2019s ideological spectrum, it could help Burr, who is easily the best known of the four GOPers in the race. Burr could also be helped by a large turnout of business and professional voters supporting Gov. Pat McCrory\u2019s (R) bond issue for education and transportation.\n\nBurr\u2019s voting record puts him on the right, but not as conservative as some GOPers prefer. The National Journal rates him 80% conservative/15% liberal; the American Conservative Union rated him 88% \u201cright\u201d in 2014, with a 91% lifetime rating. According to redstate.com, Burr \u201chas alienated many GOP activists with a voting record that has been rapidly trending left, leading to his earning the nickname \u2018Tricky Dick\u201d on conservative blogs.\u201d And several North Carolina Republican congressional district committees passed resolutions critical of his votes.\n\nAlthough Burr has been a vocal critic of Obamacare, the Senate Conservatives Fund named Burr one of its targets for 2016. In 2013, the group spent $40,000 on radio ads criticizing Burr for his comment that defunding the Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare, was the \u201cdumbest idea I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d\n\nHard-right activists in North Carolina tried to persuade US Rep. Mark Meadows (R) to oppose Burr, but he declined. The three other Republicans, all to Burr\u2019s right, who have filed to run against him in the primary have limited political heft.\n\nGreg Brannon, an obstetrician from Cary, is making his second US Senate bid. In 2014, Brannon, a Tea Party ally, garnered 27% in the Republican Primary, which now-US Sen. Thom Tillis (R) won. In announcing his Senate bid in December, Brannon said, \u201cNow is not the time for go-along-to-get-along Republicans.\u201d This month, he denounced President Obama\u2019s executive actions on gun control as \u201cegregious and illegal.\u201d Brannon, though better known than Burr\u2019s other two Republican challengers, still has a name ID of only 21%, says Elon University Poll director Ken Fernandez.\n\nLarry Holmquist, 61, moved from Illinois to Greensboro, NC, in 1989, where he ran a direct mail business. He has been an active Republican and in 2014, was a campaign manager for a congressional campaign in the 6th District. He decided to run against Burr when the incumbent voted against defunding Obamacare. On his website, he notes that he received 58% of the votes at nine Tea Party caucuses held in October, 2015.\n\nPaul Wright is a retired Superior Court Judge who ran against US Rep. David Price (D) in 2014, garnering 25% in that Democratic district. He was first a prosecutor, and then served 22 years as a judge, both on the state District Court and the Superior Court.\n\nBrannon is \u201cthe only significant opponent,\u201d opines a journalist. He adds, \u201cIt used to be that nobody was to the right of [Burr]. Now, everybody\u2019s to the right of him.\u201d\n\nTo win a primary in North Carolina without a runoff, a candidate must receive at least 40% of the vote and Burr is considered a likely winner in the first vote. For starters, he is in good shape financially, with $4,474,000 cash on hand as of Sept. 30, 2015. Burr, however, is not a political fixture in the state, such as the late US Sen. Jesse Helms (R).\n\n\u201cBurr\u2019s numbers have never been fantastic,\u201d says Fernandez, estimating the Senator\u2019s performance ratings as \u201cone-third approve, one-third disapprove and one-third don\u2019t know or undecided.\u201d\n\nWhile noting that Burr \u201cis not as well known as some other political figures in the state\u201d and that \u201cvoters are not passionate\u201d about him, Fernandez adds, \u201cNo political experts are saying that Burr could lose the primary, or get in a runoff.\u201d While no polls have been taken of the GOP\u2019s upcoming Senate primary, in General Election matchups, he leads likely Democratic nominee Deborah Ross, a former state representatives, by a ten-point margin.\n\nBut in this year of turmoil among Republican voters, with outsiders like Trump, Ted Cruz and Ben Carson attracting major support, Burr is not entirely out of the woods.
