In my column on May 28, I discussed the Senate Armed Services Committee’s consideration of the Pentagon policy bill for fiscal year 2015. I noted missed opportunities to make policy changes that would help to make the Pentagon budget sustainable in these times of fiscal restraint.

Last week the House of Representatives passed its version of the Pentagon appropriations bill. Unlike the authorization bill, which sets policy, the appropriations bill is where the fiscal rubber meets the road. Once the president signs the appropriations bill (after Senate action and then a meeting to resolve differences between the House and Senate versions), checks can be cut by the U.S. Treasury and money begins to flow. So this is the legislation that needs to be shaped if you want to affect the federal deficit and ensure smart use of the taxpayers’ money.

As a first step before the checks can be written, the House Appropriations Committee acted on the president’s budget request for the Pentagon. Briefly, the House committee added four additional F-35 aircraft, for an additional $479 million. The committee also added close to $1 billion for 12 additional EA-18G “Growler” aircraft for the Navy. While the Growler and other aircraft currently in our inventory can fulfill many of the F-35 missions at a fraction of the cost, the only way we can achieve those savings is by not buying the hugely expensive F-35.

The committee also prohibited the Pentagon from taking even the smallest step toward saving some of the money spent on the nuclear “triad” (the three different ways the U.S. can deliver nuclear weapons) by saying the Air Force cannot conduct a study of the environmental impact of placing some missile silos into an “inactive” status.

During consideration of this massive spending bill in the full House of Representatives, several lawmakers offered fiscally sound amendments. Among them:
