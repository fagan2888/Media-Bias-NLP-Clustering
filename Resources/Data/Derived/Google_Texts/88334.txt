Maryland transfer Connor Cannizzaro is off to an extraordinary start for the No. 1-ranked University of Denver men’s lacrosse team. The sophomore attack had another eight-point performance Saturday in the Pioneers’ 16-6, home-opening victory over Air Force at Peter Barton Lacrosse Stadium.

Cannizzaro had six goals and two assists against the Falcons, making him the first DU player to ever produce eight points twice during the same season. In last weekend’s season-opening, 17-13 win against defending NCAA champion Duke, Cannizzaro had three goals and five assists.

Another impact newcomer, true freshman faceoff specialist Trevor Baptiste, was again dominant too. He won 17-of-21 draws against Air Force and is now 42-of-55 in his two-game career.

Denver used a 6-2 run to begin the game and a dominant 7-2 stretch to finish it. Sophomore attack Zach Miller, who beat out Cannizzaro for the NCAA’s freshman of the year award last season, produced four points against Air Force on three assists and a goal. Senior goalie Ryan LaPlante made five saves in 55 minutes of action.

Because of the Front Range snowstorm, Denver will play Furman at 1 p.m. Sunday at Air Force’s indoor Holaday Athletic Center. Facility restrictions will prevent fans and media from attending the game.
