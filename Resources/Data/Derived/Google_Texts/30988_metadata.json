We are appreciative. There is a new chapter opened post-inauguration of the Afghan unity government. The true spirit of partnership was revived after a few years of missed opportunities.\u201d\n\nWrapping up a nearly week-long visit to Washington, D.C., with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, Abdullah spoke with The Daily Signal before a speech at The Heritage Foundation Thursday morning.\n\n\u201cThe true spirit of partnership was revived after a few years of missed opportunities,\u201d says @DrAAbdullah of U.S.-Afghanistan relations\n\nThough Abdullah\u2019s official authority in the Afghanistan government is not well-defined, he technically shares executive authority with Ghani, his opponent in last year\u2019s election.\n\nFlashing humor and resolve, Abdullah tried to show that Afghanistan\u2019s new leaders are different than former President Hamid Karzai, who was known for using anti-American rhetoric and being resistant to the enduring presence of U.S. troops in the country.\n\nAbdullah, often using words like \u201cgrateful\u201d and \u201cpartnership,\u201d thanked President Obama for his announcement this week that the United States will maintain its current force of 9,800 American troops in Afghanistan until at least the end of the year.\n\nLast year, Obama had said that by the end of 2015, U.S. forces in Afghanistan would be reduced to about half of the current levels.\n\nMore than 2,300 Americans have been killed fighting in Afghanistan since 2001.\n\nThough he declared that Afghanistan \u201chas to\u201d eventually be able to stand alone, Abdullah said a continued American presence in the country is necessary to help confront an expected springtime resurgence of Taliban fighting and to continue training the Afghan security forces.\n\nAt the height of the war, there were more than 130,000 international troops in Afghanistan, Abdullah said. Now there are about 12,000, he said.\n\nAbdullah told The Daily Signal that Afghanistan\u2019s leaders want to avoid the fate of Iraq, where a hasty American exit from that country helped contribute to the rise of ISIS terrorists.\n\nISIS, also known as the Islamic State or ISIL, does not present an \u201cimminent threat\u201d to Afghanistan, Abdullah said, but the country is prepared for that possibility considering the insecurity in the broader region.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s [ISIS] something nobody can ignore in the region or beyond the region,\u201d Abdullah said. \u201cWe have to keep our eye on it.\u201d\n\nBut Abdullah preferred to frame challenges as opportunities.\n\nHe said Afghanistan would keep an \u201copen door\u201d to potential peace talks with the Taliban and \u201cmake inroads\u201d to improve its relationship\u2014and cooperation against terrorism\u2014with neighboring Pakistan.\n\nHe said the country will work to improve human rights conditions and root out corruption.\n\nThough Abdullah cannot match the Western background of Ghani\u2014who lived in the United States for more than 20 years\u2014he showcases a suave, smooth-talking style.\n\nWhen an audience member questioned his country\u2019s sincerity in tackling human rights, Abdullah calmly, but firmly, shot back.\n\n\u201cHuman rights is a top priority,\u201d said Abdullah, a politician of Tajik-Pashtun ethnicity who began his career as an eye surgeon. \u201cWithout addressing human rights and women\u2019s rights, we cannot survive. Of course there will be resistance. But I can assure you it is a top priority. I don\u2019t recall a conversation [with American leaders this week] where this issue was not raised.\u201d\n\nThough there have been reports that Ghani has tried to consolidate power and weaken Abdullah, the chief executive insists the relationship \u201cis working.\u201d\n\nHe smiled when he said that as chief executive, \u201cI tend to have more insight into the country than most, with the exception of the president of course.\u201d\n\nVoicing a sentiment that isn\u2019t always a reality in Washington, Abdullah vowed to work with his former opponent for the betterment of Afghanistan\u2014and for the sake of America\u2019s sacrifice.\n\n\u201cWe are on the same page,\u201d Abdullah said. \u201cWe come from different backgrounds and at times disagree and are strong in defending our views. You consider that normal. I will never underestimate the challenges ahead of us. But also look at the opportunities. The opportunities are endless. For the two of us, the opportunities can never be better.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "In an exclusive interview with The Daily Signal, Afghanistan\u2019s chief executive promised a \u201cnew chapter\u201d in relations with the United States.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "In an exclusive interview with The Daily Signal, Afghanistan\u2019s chief executive promised a \u201cnew chapter\u201d in relations with the United States.", "title": "Afghanistan CEO: US \u2018Blood and Treasure\u2019 Won\u2019t Be Wasted", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/Unknown7.jpeg", "updated_time": "2015-03-26T18:59:45+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1yeQ0Sw"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "In an exclusive interview with The Daily Signal, Afghanistan\u2019s chief executive promised a \u201cnew chapter\u201d in relations with the United States.", "title": "Afghanistan CEO: US \u2018Blood and Treasure\u2019 Won\u2019t Be Wasted", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/Unknown7.jpeg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Evergreen Topics", "tag": "middle east", "published_time": "2015-03-26T19:02:33+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-26T18:59:45+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Afghanistan, Abdullah Abdullah, President Ghani, ISIS, terrorism, Taliban, Pakistan"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb957\"", "article_summary": "When an audience member questioned his country\u2019s sincerity in tackling human rights, Abdullah calmly, but firmly, shot back.\nAt the height of the war, there were more than 130,000 international troops in Afghanistan, Abdullah said.\n\u201cIn Afghanistan, the U.S. has invested a lot in blood and treasure and it\u2019s important that those investments are preserved,\u201d said Abdullah Abdullah, chief executive of Afghanistan, a role created as part of an American-brokered deal to end a political crisis ignited by election fraud in the nation\u2019s presidential election last year.\n\u201cHuman rights is a top priority,\u201d said Abdullah, a politician of Tajik-Pashtun ethnicity who began his career as an eye surgeon.\nISIS, also known as the Islamic State or ISIL, does not present an \u201cimminent threat\u201d to Afghanistan, Abdullah said, but the country is prepared for that possibility considering the insecurity in the broader region."}
