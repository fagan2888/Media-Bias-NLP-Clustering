As the mounting panic surrounding the drought suggests, the Golden State, once renowned for meeting human and geographic challenges, is losing its ability to cope with crises. As a result, the great American land of opportunity is devolving into something that resembles feudalism, a society dominated by rich and poor, with little opportunity for upward mobility for the state\u2019s middle- and working classes\u2026.\n\nIndeed, if you look at California\u2019s greatest achievements as a society, the Pat Brown legacy stands at the core. The California Aqueduct turned vast stretches of the Central Valley into one of the most productive farming regions in the world. The freeway system, now in often shocking disrepair, allowed for the construction of mass suburbia that offered millions a quality of life never experienced by previous generations. At the same time the development of energy resources\u2014California still boasts the nation\u2019s third-largest oil production\u2014helped create a huge industrial base that included aerospace, semiconductors, and a host of specialized industries, from logistics to garment manufacturing.\n\nIn contrast, Jerry Brown has waged a kind of Oedipal struggle against his father\u2019s legacy\u2026\n\n[P]rogressive narcissism is, as some conservatives assert, not the main problem. California greens are, to be sure, active, articulate, well-organized, and well-financed. What they lack is an effective counterpoint from the business class, who would be expected to challenge some of their policies. But the business leadership often seems to be more concerned with how to adjust the status quo to serve privileged large businesses, including some in agriculture, than boosting the overall economy. The greens, and their public-sector allies, can dominate not because they are so effective as that their potential opposition is weak, intimidated, and self-obsessed.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Kotkin: Jerry Brown is a Disaster--and California Business Elite Won't Stop Him", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Kotkin: Jerry Brown is a Disaster--and California Business Elite Won't Stop Him", "title": "Kotkin: Jerry Brown is a Disaster-and California Business Elite Won't Stop Him - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 937, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/Jerry-Brown-Rich-Pedroncelli-Associated-Press.png", "height": 702}, "updated_time": "2015-04-19T08:48:15-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/california/2015/04/19/kotkin-jerry-brown-is-a-disaster-and-corporations-are-cowards/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Kotkin: Jerry Brown is a Disaster--and California Business Elite Won't Stop Him", "creator": "@joelpollak", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/Jerry-Brown-Rich-Pedroncelli-Associated-Press.png", "title": "Kotkin: Jerry Brown is a Disaster-and California Business Elite Won't Stop Him - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "business, environmentalists, greens, Jerry Brown, joel kotkin, opposition, pat brown,Breitbart California, Environment,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2015-04-19T11:00:22-07:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/joelpollak", "section": "Breitbart California", "modified_time": "2015-04-19T08:48:15-07:00", "tag": "pat brown", "categories": "Breitbart California,Environment"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "California greens are, to be sure, active, articulate, well-organized, and well-financed.\nIndeed, if you look at California\u2019s greatest achievements as a society, the Pat Brown legacy stands at the core.\nWhat they lack is an effective counterpoint from the business class, who would be expected to challenge some of their policies.\nThe California Aqueduct turned vast stretches of the Central Valley into one of the most productive farming regions in the world.\nIn contrast, Jerry Brown has waged a kind of Oedipal struggle against his father\u2019s legacy\u2026[P]rogressive narcissism is, as some conservatives assert, not the main problem."}
