Grunenthal is a European pharmaceutical company that entered into a collaboration with AcelRx to commercialize Zalviso in Europe.For the full year ended Dec. 31, 2014, AcelRx reported a net loss of $33.4 million, or 91 cents per share. This compares to a net loss of $23.4 million, or 59 cents per share for 2013.On average, analysts predict that AcelRx Pharmaceuticals will report a loss of 95 cents per share for the current fiscal year.Increased expenses in the recent quarter were also attributed to potential commercialization of the company\u2019s key Zalviso product.\n\nZalviso is a patient-activated, handheld device which allows a hospital patient to self-administer pain medication, bypassing the invasive procedure of having to using an IV.\n\nThe product \u2014 which had already successfully undergone three phases of clinical trials \u2014 was rejected by the FDA in July. In a Complete Response Letter, the FDA asked for the completion of more bench testing and a human factor study.After fulfilling these requests over the past six months, the company hoped to resubmit Zalviso for approval later this March. But last Friday \u2014 before the Monday earnings announcement \u2014 the FDA made an additional request for yet another clinical trial to assess the device\u2019s dispensing risks, pushing back the resubmission date.On the earnings call with analysts, AcelRx Chief Executive Richard King said the company will not resubmit the Zalviso New Drug Application (NDA) this quarter.King said last week\u2019s correspondence from the FDA was \u201cunexpected.\u201d He said the company had been \u201cdiligently working with the [FDA] and conducting their requested studies to resubmit the NDA and preparation for that resubmission was on schedule.\u201dFounder and Chief Marketing Officer Dr. Pamela Palmer said she remains confident that the Zalviso product will trump the trials and eventually get FDA approval.The company\u2019s latest testing to date has shown a low rate of dispensing errors, Palmer said, and the completed human factors study has demonstrated proper use of product by both patients and healthcare professionals.Palmer said, \u201cWe are optimistic that discussions with the FDA will lead to a path forward for this much-needed patient-controlled analgesia system.\u201dGuggenheim Securities Senior Analyst Louise Chen also said he was optimistic, noting that Zalviso may have longer-than-expected brand exclusivity. Because it\u2019s so difficult for a drug-and-device combination, such as Zalviso, to get FDA approval in the first place, it will be hard to make it a generic in the future, and thus lose value.\u201cWe are exceptionally difficult as a product because we\u2019re a drug-device combination,\u201d Palmer added. \u201cWe have all the hurdles with the drug, we have all the hurdles with the device.\u201d\u201cDespite the delay in Zalvio\u2019s NDA resubmission given the FDA\u2019s request for an additional clinical trial to assess the risk of dispensing issues, our investment thesis remains intact,\u201d Chen said. \u201cWe continue to believe Zalviso and the rest of ACRX\u2019s pipeline have the potential to drive billions of dollars in sales while the Street only expects several hundred million dollars of peak sales for these assets.\u201dAnalysts at Mizuho downgraded shares to a \u201cneutral\u201d rating and lowered their price target for the stock by 60 percent from $14 to $5.59 in a research note Monday.At the close of trading on Monday on the NASDAQ Stock Exchange, shares of AcelRx closed at $5.51, down almost 39 percent from the previous day close of $9.01. That was a 59 percent drop from the 52-week high of $13.40. The stock has continued to fall since, closing on Thursday at $4.15.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Peninsula Press", "description": "The specialty pharmaceutical company suffered an almost 40 percent drop in stock price, after an unanticipated FDA request was made right before the company announced its fourth quarter earnings.", "title": "AcelRx stock takes hard hit after unexpected FDA request  - Peninsula Press", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://peninsulapress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ACRX_photo2.png", "updated_time": "2015-03-12T17:01:38+00:00", "url": "http://peninsulapress.com/2015/03/12/acelrx-stock-takes-hard-hit-after-fda-request/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PeninsuPress", "section": "Business + Tech", "tag": "Stock", "published_time": "2015-03-12T16:48:14+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-12T17:01:38+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "The specialty pharmaceutical company suffered an almost 40 percent drop in stock price, after an unanticipated FDA request was made right before the company announced its fourth quarter earnings.", "creator": "@PeninsuPress", "image": "http://peninsulapress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ACRX_photo2.png", "title": "AcelRx stock takes hard hit after unexpected FDA request  - Peninsula Press", "site": "@PeninsuPress", "card": "summary"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.2.4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe64ee\"", "article_summary": "The product \u2014 which had already successfully undergone three phases of clinical trials \u2014 was rejected by the FDA in July.\nThe stock has continued to fall since, closing on Thursday at $4.15.\nAcelRx Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative therapies for the treatment of pain, suffered an almost 40 percent drop in stock price, due to an unanticipated FDA request made right before the company announced its fourth quarter earnings on Monday.\nGrunenthal is a European pharmaceutical company that entered into a collaboration with AcelRx to commercialize Zalviso in Europe.For the full year ended Dec. 31, 2014, AcelRx reported a net loss of $33.4 million, or 91 cents per share.\nZalviso is a patient-activated, handheld device which allows a hospital patient to self-administer pain medication, bypassing the invasive procedure of having to using an IV."}
