While campaigning in Iowa last Saturday, Ted Cruz left his supporters at Darrell's Place in Hamlin, Iowa with a little religious advice.

"Just one minute a day. That you simply say father God please, continue this awakening. Continue the spirit of revival. Awaken the body of Christ, that we might pull back from the abyss," Cruz preached.

Ted Cruz is certainly feeling the need to build a stronger relationship with Christians in Iowa as they will play a major roll in Monday's republican primary. The relationship between evangelicals and the republican winner from Iowa almost always correlates.
