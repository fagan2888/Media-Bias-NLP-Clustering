But now he says he\u2019ll have to find another supplier.\n\n\u201cWith the Obamacare it just will affect the businesses too much so that was their main reason for shutting down the ice cream plant at this time,\u201d he said.\n\nThe CFO confirmed with Fox28 that Obamacare played a large role in the decision to shut down the plant:\n\nFox 28: South Bend, Elkhart IN News, Weather, Sports\n\n\u201cOur businesses have been concerned, kind of wondering \u2018how much is this going to cost? How is it going to impact us?\u201d said Kyle Hannon, Elkhart Chamber of Commerce President.\n\n\u201cCompanies that were right on the edge of hiring more employees have held back because they don\u2019t want to go over that magic 50 employee number,\u201d he said, adding that he doesn\u2019t expect there to be more shutdowns like the Bonnie Doon plant.\n\nUncertainty dominates the conversation.\n\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s just kind of uncertain about what\u2019s going to happen and what it all entails,\u201d said Carroll.\n\nFor now, the small business owner, he will do his best to keep his store running.\n\n(H/T: The Right Scoop)\n\n\u2013\n\nFollow Becket Adams (@BecketAdams) on Twitter\n\nFeatured image Fox28.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "gplus-count": 7, "twitter": {"description": "An ice cream plant in Elkhart, Ind., was reportedly forced to close its doors last Friday after its owners decided that it would cost too much to comply with Obamacare, President Obama's massive health care law.
