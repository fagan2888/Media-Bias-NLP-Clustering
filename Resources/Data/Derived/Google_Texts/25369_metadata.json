They\u2019re inconsistent with one another,\u201d says David Chase, California director of the Small Business Majority advocacy organization.\n\nMany of the affected businesses are family-run establishments that don\u2019t have human resources departments, says Liliana Salazar, a senior vice president at Wells Fargo Insurance who advises employers on their benefits packages.\n\n\u201cMany are completely oblivious to what they\u2019re facing,\u201d she says.\n\nAdam Rochon, an insurance agent in the Central Valley city of Exeter, confirms employers\u2019 frustrations. Many of his small business clients are farmers and owners of blue-collar companies who are \u201cscared and frustrated.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese guys are great truck drivers and farm workers, but not human resources guys,\u201d he says. \u201cNow they\u2019re forced with paying a ton of money to outsource this or do it themselves.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, the cost of not complying could also be dear.\n\nQ: I am a business owner with 78 full-time workers. Is there anything I need to know about health insurance changes next year?\n\nA: Oh yes.\n\nI\u2019m going to focus on two, and I\u2019m going to simplify for your sanity \u2013 and mine.\n\nIf you think you might be subject to these changes, I highly recommend you seek expert guidance. More on that later.\n\nEMPLOYER MANDATE\n\nObamacare\u2019s employer mandate requires \u201clarge\u201d businesses to provide \u201caffordable\u201d health coverage to their employees or face financial penalties. (That\u2019s affordable as defined by the law.)\n\nStarting Jan. 1, the mandate will expand to include businesses with at least 50 full-time equivalent workers, compared with 100 this year.\n\nIn other words, businesses with 50 to 100 workers will be considered large and will be required to offer insurance to their employees.\n\nThis year, 89 percent of firms with between 50 and 99 workers offered benefits to at least some workers, according to the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF).\n\nRestaurants, retail establishments and construction firms are among the employers in this category that are least likely to offer insurance, says Larry Levitt, a senior vice president at KFF.\n\nNext year, they\u2019ll face a penalty if they don\u2019t.\n\nMore specifically, a business will be dinged if it doesn\u2019t offer insurance to at least 95 percent of its full-time employees and their children, or if the coverage it offers doesn\u2019t meet Obamacare\u2019s standards. (Businesses don\u2019t necessarily have to provide coverage to spouses, Levitt says.)\n\nUnder the law, a full-time employee is someone who works an average of at least 30 hours a week.\n\nThe penalties kick in if at least one of the business\u2019 employees signs up for a plan from a health insurance exchange such as Covered California and receives tax credits to reduce the cost of the plan.\n\nThe penalties can easily climb into the tens of thousands of dollars.\n\n\u201cA small business can\u2019t afford a penalty,\u201d Salazar says.\n\nBecause this can be complicated, the federal government is giving businesses that are newly subject to the mandate until April 1, 2016 to comply, she says.\n\nSMALL BUSINESS DEFINITION\n\nIn addition to the requirement that these business offer insurance, California is among a handful of states that next year will change the definition of \u201csmall\u201d business to include them.\n\nThis Obamacare-related change will define small businesses as those with up to 100 full-time equivalent employees, up from 50 now.\n\nBy being classified as small businesses instead of a large business, these employers must offer health insurance that complies with a different and expanded set of Obamacare rules.\n\nAs a result, most of these businesses will have to purchase new plans that meet the requirements.\n\n\u201cThe insurance carriers and products are different,\u201d Chase says. \u201cThe way they calculate the premiums is different.\u201d\n\nFor instance, under the new rules, the health plans must contain standard designs \u2013 think of those bronze, silver, gold and platinum coverage tiers offered by Covered California \u2013 and cover specific medical benefits. They also limit how much more insurers can charge employers for older workers than younger ones.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019ve got a young and healthy workforce, you might see a premium increase,\u201d Levitt says. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got an older, sicker workforce, you might see a premium decrease.\u201d\n\nOverall, Salazar predicts that both employers and workers will see higher premium costs.\n\nCovered California, the state\u2019s health insurance exchange, is opening its small business exchange to businesses in this category and has \u201cexperienced a noticeable surge in enrollment\u201d in the past few months, says spokesman Larry Hicks.\n\nCaliforniaChoice, a private health insurance exchange for small businesses, also is opening to these employers and has seen a jump in enrollments, says CEO Ron Goldstein.\n\nFinally, you\u2019ll recall from the \u201cemployer mandate\u201d section that businesses with under 50 full-time equivalent employees are not required to offer insurance to their employees. However, if they do, their plans also must meet Obamacare requirements for small businesses.\n\nGET HELP\n\nIf you\u2019re a business in this category, seek guidance. The details are incredibly complex.\n\nReach out to your local or state chamber of commerce, which can help you figure out where you stand.\n\nConsider hiring an employee benefits consultant, who can advise you on how to comply with Obamacare requirements.\n\nA licensed insurance broker can help you find the right health plan for your business, and there\u2019s no extra cost for the help.\n\nCHANGE FOR ASK EMILY\n\n\n\nStarting in January, Ask Emily is moving to a new home with Kaiser Health News.
