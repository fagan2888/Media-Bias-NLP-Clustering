In response to conservative criticism of President Barack Obama in the wake of the tragic Malaysian airliner crash, MSNBC hosts and contributors have used their airtime to support Obama’s lack of action and to attack his detractors.

Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) has been the most prominent detractor, appearing on multiple broadcasts Thursday.

“It’s just been cowardly,” McCain said Fox News’ “Hannity.” “It’s a cowardly administration that failed to give the Ukrainians weapons with which to defend themselves.”

“This is what we used to call in the military AWOL,” he added.

Salon columnist Joan Walsh took issue with these statements on MSNBC’s “PoliticsNation” with Al Sharpton Friday evening. Unfortunately, she didn’t have much to criticize McCain with except for his failed 2008 presidential campaign.

“You don’t say that about the commander-in-chief,” Walsh said. “This is a man, I respect him for his service, but if we’re going to talk cowardly, somebody tried to put Sarah Palin a heartbeat away from the presidency so that he hoped to hold onto his right-wing base. Somebody that has a lot to atone for and a lot to think about shouldn’t be tossing around words like cowardly.”

Guess she couldn’t rely on the merits of Obama’s action — or lack there of — to speak for her.
