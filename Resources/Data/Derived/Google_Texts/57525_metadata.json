Sarah Palin (R-AK) took a jab at Obama and his senior adviser Valerie Jarrett.\n\n\n\nPalin said, \u201cYou don\u2019t lift sanctions. You crack down on their assets. You cut off their oil and drill, baby, drill for our own. We don\u2019t retreat. We reload against any foe daring to test us. And that is what Iran just did. So, Congress, you got to kill the deal. The president is playing you. He so disrespects you, Congress, and our Constitution, that he won\u2019t even bring you the treaty.\u201d\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nShe continued, \u201cSo as Obama leads from behind the skirt of his right-hand man, Valerie Jarrett, then it\u2019s up to Congress to close that window. He may propose. You dispose, Congress. You got to be in it to win it, because we want peace with unapologetic mighty red, white and blue. We\u2019ll have peace. Because war is hell, yet as in all other things, this administration loves conflict so much that they\u2019ll take pressure off the bad guys that reward bad behavior. Yeah, that\u2019s an Obama world with borders wide open, IRS harassing, servers a wiping, where his bad actors are rewarded, while a Christian clerk goes to jail. So the call to action, friends, is take action. Do not play small. It does us no good to play small. That\u2019s not why you were created. And we have not enough time to play small. You be empowered, and render a biased lap-dog media powerless. Hey, media, they\u2019re onto ya! Your role is played out and you\u2019re relegated to the ash heap of history. Look around, friends, you\u2019re not alone. There are more of us than there are of them. Take action! And don\u2019t let your praying knees get lazy! God bless you. God bless Israel. God bless the United States of America.\u201d\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN", "article_metadata": {"description": "Palin: Obama Leads From Behind the Skirt of his Right Hand Man Valerie Jarrett", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Palin: Obama Leads From Behind the Skirt of his Right Hand Man Valerie Jarrett", "title": "Palin: Obama Leads From Behind the Skirt of His Right-Hand Man, Valerie Jarrett - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/09/palin1.jpg", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2015-09-09T15:23:33-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2015/09/09/palin-obama-leads-from-behind-the-skirt-of-his-right-hand-man-valerie-jarrett/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Palin: Obama Leads From Behind the Skirt of his Right Hand Man Valerie Jarrett", "creator": "@pamkeyNEN", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/09/palin1.jpg", "title": "Palin: Obama Leads From Behind the Skirt of His Right-Hand Man, Valerie Jarrett - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "President Obama, Sarah Palin, Valerie Jarrett,Breitbart TV, Middle East, Sarah Palin,Palin", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2015-09-09T15:22:12-07:00", "section": "Breitbart TV", "modified_time": "2015-09-09T15:23:33-07:00", "tag": "Valerie Jarrett", "categories": "Breitbart TV,Middle East,Sarah Palin"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce088\"", "article_summary": "God bless Israel.\nGod bless you.\nGod bless the United States of America.\u201dFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN\nSarah Palin (R-AK) took a jab at Obama and his senior adviser Valerie Jarrett.\nDo not play small."}
