I don\u2019t want to go to school in the summer,\u2019\u201d said Misty Freeman, assistant principal at the Ninth Grade Center. \u201cBut now they\u2019ve seen what we\u2019re doing and have a taste of what high school is like. And they\u2019re really having fun.\u201d\n\nThe orientation included an introduction Monday with \u201cfreshman facts,\u201d about grades, graduation requirements, student clubs, school calendars and more. On Tuesday, students began with a scavenger hunt across the entire high school campus, from the ninth grade center \u2014 formerly the Academy at Wood\u2019s Mill \u2014 to the high school buildings.\n\n\u201cThis campus is huge, and especially to an eighth-grader at the middle school who\u2019s been in just one building,\u201d Freeman said. \u201cSo we wanted them to see the whole campus.\u201d\n\nMonday and Tuesday also included three hours of \u201ccreation station,\u201d a time for students to experience some of the fun things the high school has to offer.\n\nSome students participated in robotics lessons, a movie-making course or a 3D printing class.\n\nDarrell Lucas, construction teacher at the high school, helped teams of students build their own tables in the construction lab.\n\n\u201cThis has been fantastic,\u201d Lucas said. \u201cThese kids are honestly ready to go to high school. I think they\u2019ve had a long summer.\u201d\n\nSocial studies teacher Rich Elsarelli led the students in a \u201cmoney maker\u201d course, which allows the students to make their own brands and then print the brands on T-shirts, coasters, stickers and more.\n\n\u201cThey start from scratch, brainstorming what exactly represents them,\u201d Elsarelli said. \u201c\u2026 We have a marketing and a business course, so this really goes with that. But this will also all be at the Ninth Grade Center. So, I teach social studies, and I can bring my class in to make propaganda posters, to make brands or learn about globalization.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s endless, what you can do with this.\u201d\n\nCulinary arts instructor Whittney McPherson teamed up with physical science teacher Ernie Osborne for a twofold course.\n\n\u201cThis might be the best integration of academics and career that I have seen,\u201d Freeman said. \u201cThey got together and said, \u2018What can we do with culinary arts and science to combine them?\u2019\u201d\n\nStudents spent the day making cheesecakes, while studying the physical properties of the ingredients.\n\nToday, students will practice walking their class schedules, which may include walking from the ninth grade center to the high school gymnasium for physical education classes. There are seven minutes between classes, and Freeman said the school wants to ensure students can get from one class to another.\n\n\u201cTheir content will be offered at the ninth grade center,\u201d Freeman said. \u201cEven for our students who are ninth-graders but taking 10th-grade math, we\u2019ll just offer it there. It\u2019s that whole concept of ninth-graders staying together.\u201d\n\nFreshman Focus was funded by a career tech education grant to purchase supplies including the filament for the 3D printer, the wood and supplies for the construction course and the T-shirts for the screen printing class, as well as paying the teachers\u2019 supplements.\n\nApproximately 600 freshmen will be enrolled at the center, but Freeman said she was pleased with the 125 attending Freshman Focus.\n\n\u201cWhile I would have loved to have all 600 children here, I probably would have been overwhelmed,\u201d she said. \u201cSo starting this year with 20 percent, yes, has been great. I hope next year, after we\u2019ve worked out a few little kinks, to do even better.\u201d\n\nFreeman said they want students to understand and appreciate how the new ninth-grade experience is tailored to the needs of first-time high school students.\n\n\u201cIn every class, we\u2019re really trying to focus so our kids can see the application of academics and careers,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re preparing them for in four years, and that\u2019s our focus at the ninth grade center.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.gainesvilletimes.com/archives/111125/", "image": "http://media.morristechnology.com/webmedia/upload/gainesville/article/2015/07/28/0729NINTH_0001.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The transition from middle school to high school can be a challenge.", "title": "Gainesville High program aims to ease transition for freshmen"}, "twitter": {"site": "@gtimes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "title": "Gainesville High program aims to ease transition for freshmen"}, "article_summary": "Take a look inside the new Gainesville High School Ninth Grade Center.\nThe transition from middle school to high school can be a challenge.\nThis week, rising Gainesville High School ninth-graders are getting their bearings at the new GHS Ninth Grade Center.\n\u201cBut now they\u2019ve seen what we\u2019re doing and have a taste of what high school is like.\nOn Tuesday, students began with a scavenger hunt across the entire high school campus, from the ninth grade center \u2014 formerly the Academy at Wood\u2019s Mill \u2014 to the high school buildings."}
