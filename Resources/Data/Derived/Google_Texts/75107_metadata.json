Avalere also concluded that 60 percent of silver plan formularies placed all medications for multiple sclerosis, Crohn\u2019s disease, cancer and other illnesses in the plan\u2019s highest formulary tier. That means patients who need these medicines would face the highest coinsurance percentage.\n\nPhRMA President John Castellani called on HHS to limit insurers\u2019 ability to structure drug coverage in a way that subjects patients with these types of chronic and severe illnesses from these type of high out-of-pocket costs.\n\n\u201cPlacing all medicines in the highest cost-sharing tier makes the best treatments for patient outcomes and overall value the most expensive and undermines the goal of the ACA. Cost to the patient is determined by the insurance market,\u201d Castellani said during the event.\n\nInsurers are currently submitting exchange premium rates for 2015, and Castellani said HHS could take action before those rates are finalized.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "PhRMA, Advocates: Specialty Drug Costs For Patients Too High", "og": {"site_name": "WebMD", "description": "PhRMA, Advocates: Specialty Drug Costs For Patients Too High", "title": "PhRMA, Advocates: Specialty Drug Costs Too High", "url": "http://www.webmd.com/health-insurance/20140612/phrma-advocates-specialty-drug-costs-for-patients-too-high", "image": "http://img.webmd.com/dtmcms/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/logos/webmd/web/webmd-logo-fb.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"pages": 11736558481, "app_id": 385978254785998}, "description": "PhRMA, Advocates: Specialty Drug Costs For Patients Too High", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WebMD", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/WebMD"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf5e5\"", "article_summary": "PhRMA President John Castellani called on HHS to limit insurers\u2019 ability to structure drug coverage in a way that subjects patients with these types of chronic and severe illnesses from these type of high out-of-pocket costs.\nInsurers are currently submitting exchange premium rates for 2015, and Castellani said HHS could take action before those rates are finalized.\nSpecialty drugs are most often prescribed for complex, chronic and often costly health conditions like rheumatoid arthritis and hepatitis C that require continuous monitoring by a health care provider.\nCost to the patient is determined by the insurance market,\u201d Castellani said during the event.\nAvalere also concluded that 60 percent of silver plan formularies placed all medications for multiple sclerosis, Crohn\u2019s disease, cancer and other illnesses in the plan\u2019s highest formulary tier."}
