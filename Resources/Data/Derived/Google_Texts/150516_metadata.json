He was a persistent thorn in the side of law-enforcement in northern Kentucky, picking up a new charge about every six months as an adult for a variety of minor misdeeds.\n\nHe didn\u2019t kill anyone, didn\u2019t ever seriously injure anyone. But in the end, as the 25-year-old Rose hanged from a blue bed sheet attached to a ceiling vent in cell D5 at the Grant County Detention Center, it was the criminal-justice system that had wronged him.\n\nA Kentucky State Police investigation concluded that there was \u201cno indication of foul play\u201d in connection with Rose\u2019s death on Sept. 20, 2010. But an inquiry by the Kentucky Center for Investigative Reporting into the circumstances surrounding Rose\u2019s death found the following missteps:\n\nThe court system contrived and imposed a sentence that illegally banished Rose from a three-county area, a punishment meted out barely four months after a Kentucky Court of Appeals decision referred to a probation order including banishment as \u201cinvalid\u201d and \u201cvoid.\u201d\n\nThe corrections system ignored Rose\u2019s alleged threat of self harm when he was jailed for violating the banishment order, and then placed him alone in a maximum-security cell with the bed sheet.\n\nAnd employees at the jail failed to properly watch over Rose in isolation, thus violating its own rules requiring a cell check every 30 minutes. After about an hour had elapsed with no observation, a deputy found Rose hanging from the ceiling.\n\nCourt and corrections officials involved in the events leading to Rose\u2019s death case either refused to discuss their decisions with KyCIR or else denied wrongdoing.\n\nBut this much is clear: Rose\u2019s banishment and the jail\u2019s missteps set in motion the events that led to his death.\n\n----\n\nThis article was produced by the Kentucky Center for Investigative Reporting, a new nonprofit newsroom from Louisville Public Media. Read more at http://kycir.org.\n\n----\n\nDavid Harris, a University of Pittsburgh School of Law professor and nationally recognized criminal-justice expert, was harshly critical of the handling of Rose\u2019s case.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a cascade of failures, it really is,\u201d Harris said after reviewing documents and the facts of the case. \u201cIt simply isn\u2019t right.\u201d\n\nPrior to his last arrest, Derrick Rose had tried to repair his broken-down car so he could comply with the court\u2019s directive and leave Carrollton, according to his brother, Chris, and other family members. But the repairs didn\u2019t get done in time, and Rose was taken into custody for violating the court order.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t understand why he was back there (in jail), because he was just trying to get his car fixed and get out of town,\u201d said his mother, Kathy Richards, who spoke to Rose by telephone shortly after his arrest.\n\nKentucky law prohibiting banishment in cases like Rose\u2019s appears clear and has been for nearly a half-century. In December 1965, the state Court of Appeals held that it is \u201cbeyond the power of a court to inflict banishment as an alternative to imprisonment.\u201d A Kentucky Supreme Court decision just last May reaffirmed that position.\n\nYet, the little-discussed practice persists as a tool used by police, prosecutors and judges to rid their jurisdictions of characters they deem unsavory -- and troublesome.\n\nA recent KyCIR investigation detailed the journey of Adam Horine, a mentally ill man banished from Carroll County by police who took him out of jail in violation of a court order and put him on a bus to Florida with a one-way ticket and a few dollars in his pocket.\n\nHorine\u2019s case provoked a furor across the state, and the two Carrollton police officials allegedly behind his expulsion have been indicted. But Horine at least survived his travail.\n\nDerrick Rose did not.\n\nChris Rose at his brother Derrick's gravesite in Carrollton.

Derrick Rose, in handcuffs and dressed in a black-and-white-striped jail jumpsuit, had been there before and knew the routine. His latest charges: stealing a laptop computer, trespassing and punching a woman in the face for betraying his girlfriend.\n\nThe crimes, all misdemeanors, carried the possibility of up to a year in jail. Rose didn\u2019t want to be incarcerated for another lengthy stretch. Agreeing to get out and stay out of town -- banishment -- had more appeal.\n\nUnder this deal, proposed by Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney James Crawford and defense lawyer Edward Bourne, Rose would serve no more than 90 days in jail, then leave the area for the next two years.\n\nBates rattled off the charges and Rose\u2019s rights with machine-gun speed and efficiency; he\u2019d done this drill thousands of times during his 25 years on the bench. The entire proceeding lasted barely five minutes, including a snide dig by Bates at the state\u2019s \u201cfeel-good parole board that wants to let everybody out of jail.\u201d\n\nThe last of the 10 conditions in Rose\u2019s plea agreement was mentioned only in passing during the five-minute hearing, but it would have by far the most profound impact. Condition # 10 was this:\n\n\u201cDefendant shall not be in Carroll, Grant or Owen counties during the term of his conditional discharge.\u201d\n\nNobody -- not the long-time judge, not the veteran prosecutor, not the seasoned defense attorney -- and certainly not Rose -- seized on that point, discussed it, questioned it, objected to it.\n\nRose quickly agreed to the offer. Bates just as quickly accepted it. The deal was done.\n\nBut it shouldn\u2019t have been, according to state court rulings and in the opinion of Harris and other legal authorities.\n\nLess than five months earlier, the state Court of Appeals had ruled on the case of Lakinda Sharee Butler, who had been banished from Fayette County for two years as part of a probated sentence after pleading guilty to possessing marijuana. Butler later returned to support a friend at a court hearing, was arrested and ordered to serve a year in jail.\n\nThe banishment was wrong, the appellate court held, citing the 1965 ruling. The 2010 Court of Appeals ruling also referred to the probation including banishment as \u201cinvalid\u201d and \u201cvoid.\u201d\n\nTen weeks after agreeing to the illegal plea deal, Rose had served his time and walked out of the Grant County Detention Center. His next move should have been to get out of town, fast.\n\nKathy Richards discussing her son Derrick's death. (Photo: Tyler Franklin / KyCIR)\n\nHis mother and stepfather had already moved Rose\u2019s personal belongings to Cabot, Arkansas, where they lived.\n\nThey thought he might be able to turn his life around there.\n\nRose never completed high school. His first arrest as an adult came at age 18. He toiled at various jobs when he wasn\u2019t locked up. He acknowledged drug and alcohol problems. And his rap sheet, rife with mostly minor offenses, grew and grew.\n\nHis family believed this time might be different. But then his car broke down.\n\nCarrollton police picked Rose up on the evening of Sept. 16, 2010, after an officer said he saw Rose while attempting to serve a warrant at a local residence. Rose\u2019s mere presence in town was a violation of the banishment order.\n\nHe was transferred to the Grant County jail a day later and deputies there placed him in solitary confinement. Richards said that when Rose called her from jail, he was upset about being incarcerated again.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018Derrick, it\u2019s Friday afternoon, we can\u2019t do anything, I\u2019ll look at it Monday, we\u2019ll sort it out on Monday,\u2019\u201d Richards recalled.\n\nState police records offer contradictory accounts of why Rose was in solitary. At least one jail deputy said he requested it. But another, Edward Hirst, said Rose was \u201cwanting to know why he was in \u2018Max,\u2019\u201d or maximum security, and why he had been arrested.\n\nRose was \u201cagitated but otherwise fine\u201d when Hirst spoke with him at 9:30 a.m. on Sept. 18, 2010, according to the records. After that check, another inmate later told state police, Rose was kicking his cell door, as if trying to \u201cget someone\u2019s attention.\u201d\n\nDeputies are supposed to observe inmates in solitary confinement every 30 minutes, according to jail protocol. But the cell next check did not occur at 10 a.m. as required. An incident involving another inmate delayed the scheduled watch tour. So it was not until about an hour after Rose was last observed that Hirst found him suspended from the ceiling.\n\nThe sheet was knotted in front of him, with a foot of excess cloth draped across his chest. His body was still warm, but he had no pulse and was not breathing. Two days later, at a local hospital, the petty criminal\u2019s life ended with premature death.\n\nHis family members don\u2019t think Rose really wanted to die, but rather that he was frustrated over being in jail again and was crying out for help.\n\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t wanting to commit suicide, I can tell you that,\u201d said his brother, Chris Rose, a utility-company superintendent in neighboring Carroll County. \u201cHe was wanting attention, he was wanting to get out of jail.\u201d\n\nThe state police investigation into his death didn\u2019t uncover any evidence that Rose appeared suicidal, and he left no note. Deputy Hirst told state police he never heard Rose speak of wanting to kill himself.\n\nMoreover, the jail\u2019s own inquiry found \u201cno violation of Grant County Detention Center rules and regulations or operational procedures,\u201d even though it acknowledged that Rose was not checked in a timely manner. \u201cAll deputies performed their duties in a responsible and professional manner,\u201d jail officials concluded.\n\nBut the U.S. Justice Department reached a very different bottom line about the circumstances surrounding Rose\u2019s death.\n\nIn 2005, the department had issued a scathing report identifying an array of constitutional violations at the jail, including \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d to inmates\u2019 serious medical and mental-health needs. None of those instances had involved fatalities, however. Now, DOJ had found what it decided were new -- and fatal -- examples of that neglect.\n\nIn a Feb. 6, 2013, letter to Grant County, the department blamed \u201cserious breakdowns in jail medical care\u201d for Rose\u2019s death and that of Carl Lewis, another inmate who committed suicide earlier in 2010.\n\nWithout identifying Rose by name, the department\u2019s letter stated that \u201cin September 2010, a new prisoner arrived and told staff that he was going to kill himself.\u201d The jail\u2019s response, according to the letter, \u201cessentially consisted of putting the prisoner in a segregation cell. The jail staff left the prisoner with a sheet, and the prisoner hung himself.\u201d\n\nThe Justice Department refused repeated requests from KyCIR to discuss the letter or to provide documents supporting it.\n\nSteve Kellam, who was Grant County\u2019s elected jailer when Rose died, refused a request from KyCIR to discuss the jail\u2019s investigation or circumstances surrounding Rose\u2019s death. Kellam initially said he was declining \u201cout of respect for\u201d Rose\u2019s family. Told that family members were willing to have the facts of the case aired, Kellam responded:\n\n\u201cI want no part of your agenda. Negative comments and issues that were dealt with in the past are just that, the past.\u201d\n\nThe defense attorney and the judge involved in Rose\u2019s banishment also were unwilling to talk about it.\n\nBourne, who represented Rose and who signed off on the banishment deal, initially told KyCIR that he opposes the extrajudicial practice. \u201cI don\u2019t think it should be done. Period,\u201d he said.\n\nBourne, a criminal defense attorney for more than 20 years, currently represents Horine, the mentally ill man banished to Florida by Carrollton police. And Bourne acknowledged that he\u2019ll likely file a lawsuit over Horine\u2019s banishment.\n\nAsked about the apparent contradiction in his approach to the two cases, Bourne refused to discuss them, citing attorney-client privilege. He also was unwilling to talk about his handling of Rose\u2019s case \u201cin any way, shape or form.\u201d\n\nJudge Bates -- who is now retired -- said he had no interest in \u201ctalking about any of this.\u201d\n\nWhen Crawford, the commonwealth\u2019s attorney who prosecuted Rose, was asked by KyCIR about banishment in general, he distanced himself from it, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t know that I\u2019ve ever seen it actually done. If it has been done in recent years, I have no recollection of it.\u201d\n\nReminded of the facts of Rose\u2019s case, Crawford aggressively defended his handling of it.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t force the man (Rose) out of the county,\u201d Crawford insisted. \u201cIt was a negotiated condition.\u201d Crawford also contended that Rose\u2019s guilty plea and jail sentence were \u201cclearly legal.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the two Court of Appeals rulings holding that banishment clearly is illegal, a decision last May by the Kentucky Supreme Court also rejected banishment.\n\nThat case involved a juvenile who had avoided prosecution by agreeing to move to Oklahoma to live with his father. About five months later, he rejoined his mother in Kentucky, and the charge against him was renewed.\n\nThe justices voted unanimously to reverse the judgment in the case, noting that among other legal missteps, the lower court had ordered \u201cthe literal banishment of the child from Kentucky.\u201d The supreme court added: \u201cBanishment is not a legal disposition under Kentucky law, even as a condition of probation or alternative to imprisonment for adults.\u201d\n\nFamily photo of Derrick Rose (Photo: Tyler Franklin / KyCIR)\n\nTwo veteran Kentucky defense attorneys who reviewed the disposition of Rose\u2019s case at KyCIR\u2019s request agreed with Professor Harris that it constituted illegal banishment.\n\n\u201cProhibiting someone from entering three entire counties constitutes banishment by any definition,\u201d said Dan Goyette, a former prosecutor and the longtime head of the Louisville Metro Public Defender\u2019s office. \u201cI don\u2019t know how else it could be interpreted.\u201d\n\nKentucky Public Advocate Edward Monahan agreed,saying: \u201cKentucky case law is clear, banishment is not a legal condition to place on a defendant.\u201d\n\nHarris, the University of Pittsburgh law professor, said courts \u201cshould not be in the business of imposing unconstitutional penalties even if the defendant for one reason or another would accept those.\u201d\n\nIn Rose\u2019s case, Harris said, the banishment condition was \u201cflat-out unconstitutional and should never have happened in the first place. If it\u2019s not right for the court to impose it, whether it\u2019s agreed upon or not.\u201d\n\nHarris also asked rhetorically: \u201cCould the defendant, as a way of cementing the plea agreement, accept 20 lashes? No, you can\u2019t do that. We don\u2019t do that anymore. Can the defendant say, \u2018I\u2019ll accept a certain amount of time with the thumb screws?\u2019 No, we don\u2019t do that. That\u2019s beyond the pale. It\u2019s simply wrong. And it puts the law on the wrong side of common sense.\u201d\n\nRichards said she and her family did not contest Rose\u2019s banishment because they could not find a lawyer who would file suit.\n\nShe said she takes some comfort in the fact that her son\u2019s donated organs saved at least two lives and improved several others. But she and other family members still harbor anger and frustration, because they think Rose\u2019s banishment was wrong, because they think the jail was negligent and because no one was held accountable.\n\n\u201cCould they have saved him? Absolutely,\u201d Chris Rose said.\n\nThat is why it is \u201creally important\u201d that the circumstances surrounding his death be explored, even now, Richards said. \u201cIf it saves one life in the future, then it is all worth it.\u201d\n\nThis story was produced by the Kentucky Center for Investigative Reporting, a nonprofit news organization.
