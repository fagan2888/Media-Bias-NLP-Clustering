Getty Images\n\nFor unemployed workers or young people looking to get a foothold in the labor market, finding a job isn\u2019t just about looking at fields where new jobs are being added.\n\n(Though last week\u2019s payroll report showed that companies are creating positions at a nice clip).\n\nA much better source of jobs is existing positions that are vacated by current workers who found a better opportunity at the company across town. That kind of turnover makes up the bulk of what economists call \u201cchurn,\u201d and it generally dwarfs job creation and destruction, as millions of people quit their jobs and are replaced.\n\nAs we note today, the national rate of churn has dropped dramatically over the last decade and still remains far below prerecession levels, according to new research from Economic Modeling Specialists International and its parent company, CareerBuilder.\n\nBut the picture becomes much more variable when examined on a local level, thanks to the industry mix and economic conditions of different regions.\n\n\u201cA high churn economy\u2026is like a body with healthy circulation,\u201d notes EMSI\u2019s report, and some cities are looking quite hearty.\n\nWhile nationally, churn declined by about one-fifth between 2003 and 2013, in Boston it rose 1.5%, the only large metro area to experience an increase over the decade. EMSI, which looked at churn by region and occupational group, found that high turnover in information-technology jobs pushed the overall churn rate up.\n\nOther metros that have been resilient, seeing only single-digit declines, were Worcester, Mass.; Raleigh, N.C.; and New Haven, Conn.\n\nNot surprisingly, higher turnover is frequently associated with rising wages and in-demand skills, as desperate employers lure workers away from their current jobs with the promise of raises, or workers with valuable expertise negotiate better compensation.\n\nFor example, the churn rate for Web developers in San Jose, Calif., doubled between 2003 and 2013. The average salary for a Silicon Valley developer is about $109,000, according to job board Indeed. That\u2019s up from $101,000 a year ago, which, at the time, was about one and a half times the national average.\n\nBut mobility is down in some regions, reflecting not just the pain of the recession but also some of the factors that are reducing geographic mobility. Americans are simply not moving around as much as they used to. They\u2019re tied down by things like dual-career considerations, homes that were and maybe still are financially underwater, and a lack of cash or credit to pay the upfront costs of moving.\n\nCities in Florida were hit the hardest. The Sarasota, Fla., area had the largest decline, followed by Norfolk, Va.; Tampa, Fla.; and Jacksonville, Fla. All of those cities had churn rates above 100% in 2003\u2014meaning that on average, workers were unlikely to stay in their job for a full year\u2014and by 2013, all were below Boston\u2019s rate of 88.3%. (Churn rates can be over 100% thanks to the presence of many high-turnover, low-wage jobs, such as retail and fast-food positions).\n\nRelated coverage:\n\nNew Jobs Worry: Workers Staying Put\n\nNumber of People Starting and Quitting Jobs Climbs to Highest in More Than Six Years", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "For unemployed workers or young people looking to get a foothold in the labor market, finding a job isn\u2019t just about looking at fields where new jobs are being added.", "title": "Do People Quit Their Jobs in Your Community?
