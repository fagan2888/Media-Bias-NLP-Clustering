Ottawa also had a pair of empty-net goals in the third when the Bruins pulled Gustavsson to create a two-man advantage on the power play.\n\nDavid Pastrnak scored for Boston, and Gustavsson stopped 30 shots. The loss left Boston tied with Detroit with 93 points but trailing the Red Wings, who lost to the New York Rangers on Saturday, in the tiebreaker.\n\nThe Bruins could have still made the playoffs if the Flyers earned no more than one point in their last two games. The victory over Pittsburgh gave Philadelphia 94 points and left Boston in ninth place in the East.\n\n\u201cWe could have controlled our own fate,\u201d Bruins coach Claude Julien said before Philadelphia\u2019s victory. \u201cRight now, all we can do is cross our fingers and hope for a miracle.\u201d\n\nThe Bruins\u2019 chances of avoiding a second consecutive missed postseason were damaged when Rask, the 2014 Vezina Trophy winner, was scratched from the starting lineup with what the team said was an \u201cillness.\u201d Rask was with the team for the pregame warmup, but he spent most of it near the bench while Gustavsson took practice shots in the net.\n\nGustavsson, who hadn\u2019t started since March 18, stopped all 17 shots he faced in the first period and was spotted a 1-0 lead when Pastrnak received Brad Marchand\u2019s lofted pass over the blue line and beat Hammond just 5 minutes into the game. Pastrnak appeared to be offside, but the referee couldn\u2019t find a replay angle that was conclusive.\n\nIn the second, the Senators quickly turned things around.\n\nNeil scored 1:42 into the period, swiping twice at a rebound before it skittered under Gustavsson. Four minutes later Smith deflected Erik Karlsson\u2019s shot into the net; three minutes after that, Phil Varone slid a backhand into the slot and Puempel tapped it between Gustavsson\u2019s legs; at 10 minutes even, Zibanejad deflected another one into the net to make it 4-1.\n\nFans who had chanted \u201cWe want playoffs!\u201d earlier in the game were now booing the hometown team. Julien called a timeout and the Bruins mustered some good chances later in the period but couldn\u2019t close the gap.\n\nSenators coach Dave Cameron said he was less interested in playing spoiler than just seeing his team finish the season well.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t about Boston today,\u201d he said. \u201cWe knew what was at stake for Boston and we knew if we had any advantage in the game today, all the pressure was on them.\u201d\n\nTwice in the third period, the Senators picked up penalties and Julien pulled the goalie to create a two-man advantage. Both times, Ottawa scored empty-net goals, the first by Jean-Gabriel Pageau and the second by Smith.\n\nJulien was retained last year after general manager Peter Chiarelli was fired and replaced by Don Sweeney. The Bruins have not retained a coach after missing the playoffs two years in a row in 50 years, since Milt Schmidt was given a third season in 1965-66 before giving way to Harry Sinden.\n\nNOTES: With 85 points, the Senators finished 11th in the Eastern Conference and missed the playoffs for the second time in three seasons. \u2026 The Bruins announced team awards before the game: F Matt Beleskey was given the Eddie Shore Award for exceptional hustle and determination; F Loui Eriksson was given the Elizabeth Dufresne Trophy for outstanding performance during home games; F Jimmy Hayes earned the John P.
