I\u2019m going to work out immediately to knock out ObamaCare and start taking care of our vets and military \u2026 our vets have been absolutely treated horribly and we\u2019re going to take care of our vets. That\u2019s been a very, very big part of my campaign, the vets.\u201d\n\nStephanopoulos pressed Trump on specifics, to which Trump offered some of his ideas on health care.\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ve been specific in terms of the wall,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been very specific in terms of ObamaCare, what I\u2019m doing is very specific, whether we use health care savings accounts and that could happen because a lot of people are liking it a lot. ObamaCare is falling out under its own weight. It\u2019s going to be dead by 2017. People are not signing up for it. It\u2019s a disaster. The rates and premiums going up by 45, 55, 65 percent. And we\u2019re going to have great health care. We\u2019re going to make it a fraction of the cost and I\u2019m very specific on it, George. I\u2019m a very specific person, believe me.\u201d\n\nFollow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor", "article_metadata": {"description": "Trump Lays Out Day One Presidential Priorities --- Roll Back Obama Exec Orders, 'Knock Out' ObamaCare, Take Care of Vets", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Trump Lays Out Day One Presidential Priorities --- Roll Back Obama Exec Orders, 'Knock Out' ObamaCare, Take Care of Vets", "title": "Trump Lays Out Day One Presidential Priorities - Roll Back Obama Exec Orders, 'Knock Out' ObamaCare, Take Care of Vets - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 532, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/02/Trump224.jpg", "height": 399}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2016/02/24/trump-lays-out-day-one-presidential-priorities-roll-back-obama-exec-orders-border-obamacare-repeal-take-care-of-vets/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Trump Lays Out Day One Presidential Priorities --- Roll Back Obama Exec Orders, 'Knock Out' ObamaCare, Take Care of Vets", "creator": "@jeff_poor", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/02/Trump224.jpg", "title": "Trump Lays Out Day One Presidential Priorities - Roll Back Obama Exec Orders, 'Knock Out' ObamaCare, Take Care of Vets - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Donald Trump, George Stephanopoulos, Good Morning America,2016 Presidential Race, Breitbart TV,Trump", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "Good Morning America", "published_time": "2016-02-24T10:31:35-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart TV,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "\u201cWell, the first thing I\u2019d do is knock out some of the executive orders signed by our president,\u201d Trump said.\nI\u2019m going to work out immediately to knock out ObamaCare and start taking care of our vets and military \u2026 our vets have been absolutely treated horribly and we\u2019re going to take care of our vets.\nThat\u2019s been a very, very big part of my campaign, the vets.\u201dStephanopoulos pressed Trump on specifics, to which Trump offered some of his ideas on health care.\nAnd we\u2019re going to have great health care.\nWe\u2019re going to make it a fraction of the cost and I\u2019m very specific on it, George."}
