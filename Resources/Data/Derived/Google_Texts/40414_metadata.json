(AP) \u2014 Miriam Uribe enrolled in Medi-Cal, California\u2019s low-income health insurance program, last November. But 10 months later, she still hasn\u2019t found a primary care doctor who can see her.\n\n\u201cOnce you have (insurance), you actually still don\u2019t have it because it\u2019s still a struggle to find someone,\u201d the 20-year-old college student from Bellflower said.\n\nUribe isn\u2019t alone. Even though Latinos make up nearly half of California\u2019s 12.5 million Medi-Cal enrollees, a report by the independent California HealthCare Foundation found that 36 percent of the Spanish-speaking Medi-Cal population has been told that a physician won\u2019t take them, compared to 7 percent of the overall Medi-Cal population. Even those who speak both English and Spanish reported similar difficulty accessing doctors.\n\n\u201cThe numbers are very, very shocking,\u201d said Sarah de Guia, executive director of the California Pan-Ethnic Health Network, a multicultural health advocacy group.\n\nDe Guia said the study doesn\u2019t explain why Latinos \u2014 whether they speak English or Spanish \u2014 are being turned away at higher rates, but public policy officials say the biggest obstacle is finding doctors who are willing to take the lower payments offered by Medi-Cal. Language barriers also play a role.\n\nThe study, which compared people on Medi-Cal to those with employer-sponsored health insurance, found Latinos and Asian-Americans reported the highest rate of needing language assistance to understand their doctor. Specifically, 28 percent of Asian-Americans said their doctor does not listen carefully, compared to 15 percent of all Medi-Cal enrollees.\n\nShana Alex Charles, a research scientist at the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research who helped conduct the study, said there may not be enough providers who speak Spanish \u2014 or there could be an overall shortage of providers in communities of color.\n\nMiriam Lagos, 53, a recent Medi-Cal enrollee who lives in Sherman Oaks, said she was told she has to wait a year just to see a specialist for hearing trouble in her right ear.\n\n\u201cWe are not well-regarded by the doctors. They don\u2019t want to see us,\u201d Lagos said in an interview in Spanish.\n\nMedi-Cal, which is California\u2019s version of Medicaid, has grown rapidly in recent years as the state embraced an optional expansion under the Affordable Care Act. That surge has already led to widespread complaints about delays in patients being able to see doctors, specialists and dentists.\n\nDoctors and hospitals say the state pays much less for medical services than private insurance or Medicare, which means fewer primary care doctors and specialists are willing to treat Medi-Cal patients. Lawmakers have convened a special legislative session to discuss increasing provider payments but there is no agreement yet on how to pay for them.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s regulators says the state is committed to giving Medi-Cal recipients full and equal access to health care. The Department of Health Care Services says it works with health plans to monitor and reduce disparities in health care, and Medi-Cal provides materials and offers hotline assistance in 13 spoken and 12 written languages.\n\nThe California Medical Association, which represents the state\u2019s doctors, encourages its members to be sensitive to language and cultural differences as millions more residents gain access to health care, said spokeswoman Molly Weedn. The group is part of a coalition pushing for higher Medi-Cal provider payments and supports a bill by Assembly Speaker Toni Atkins, D-San Diego, seeking federal funding for medical interpreters in Medi-Cal.\n\nThe industry could also do more to train a more diverse medical and clinical workforce, said Xavier Morales, executive director of the Latino Coalition for A Healthy California. A 2014 review by the California HealthCare Foundation found Latinos are underrepresented in the physician workforce: 38 percent of the state\u2019s population is Latino but only 4 percent of physicians were Latino.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at graduates from medical schools, they don\u2019t really match the population,\u201d Morales said.\n\nAndrea Castillo, 21, a Medi-Cal recipient from McFarland, said it would be nice to see more Latino doctors. Growing up the oldest daughter of farm laborers, Castillo recalls driving long distances to translate for relatives at the doctor\u2019s office.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t often see a provider who looks like you, who understands you,\u201d Castillo said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "36 percent of the Spanish-speaking Medi-Cal population has been told that a physician won't take them, compared to 7 percent of the overall Medi-Cal population.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"For Latinos, Medi-Cal Offers Insurance, But Few Doctors\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2015\\/08\\/10\\/for-latinos-medi-cal-offers-insurance-but-few-doctors\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-08-10 14:59:15\",\"mod_date\":\"2015-08-10 17:04:10\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":59811,\"author_id\":\"240\",\"author_name\":\"Lisa Aliferis\",\"author_display_name\":\"Lisa Aliferis\",\"tags\":[\"Health Disparities\",\"Latino Health\",\"Medi-Cal\"],\"categories\":[\"Community Health\",\"Health Insurance\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2015\\/08\\/iStock_000045052098_Large-2-e1439243922277.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "36 percent of the Spanish-speaking Medi-Cal population has been told that a physician won't take them, compared to 7 percent of the overall Medi-Cal population.", "title": "For Latinos, Medi-Cal Offers Insurance, But Few Doctors", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2015/08/10/for-latinos-medi-cal-offers-insurance-but-few-doctors/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2015/08/iStock_000045052098_Large-2-1440x960.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "health disparities,latino health,medi-cal", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc715\"", "article_summary": "Doctors and hospitals say the state pays much less for medical services than private insurance or Medicare, which means fewer primary care doctors and specialists are willing to treat Medi-Cal patients.\nSACRAMENTO, Calif.
