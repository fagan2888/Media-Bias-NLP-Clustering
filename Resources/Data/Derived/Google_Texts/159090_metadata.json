The tax amounts to 40 percent of the cost of health coverage that exceeds federal limits, which were set at $10,200 for individual coverage, and $27,500 for family coverage. New Jersey\u2019s public employees\u2019 plans often exceed the threshold, with the tax having to be paid by their employer \u2013 the taxpayers.\n\nThe Brick Township council this week unanimously voted for a resolution requesting Congress to repeal the tax, which will cost taxpayers about $600,000 above and beyond the millions of dollars already budgeted for employee health care packages.\n\n\u201cWe believe that the legislature did not intent to negatively impact towns or taxpayers with this provision, so we\u2019re asking the state and federal governments to repeal that portion,\u201d said Mayor John Ducey.\n\nThe revelation that Brick\u2019s municipal employees\u2019 plans would fall above the Cadillac tax threshold elicited anger among several residents at the council meeting, who argued that public employees\u2019 plans were out of sync with private industry, and should be reduced.\n\n\u201cMy taxes are going to go up because of someone\u2019s Cadillac benefits,\u201d said resident Vic Fanneli, addressing township council members. \u201cYou can\u2019t afford it, the state can\u2019t afford it, and I can\u2019t afford it. But they\u2019re going to get them anyway. They want you to get rid of Cadillac benefits because nobody can afford them anymore. You have to change that. You have to go into negotiations and say, \u2018this is what we can do, and this is what we can\u2019t.\u2019\u201d\n\nBrick is self-insured for major medical insurance, meaning that medical claims up to $6.9 million are directly paid by the municipality before being sent to a secondary insurance provider, said Chief Financial Officer Scott Pezarras. But a value is still calculated for the various plans offered to employees based on the actual cost and the value of benefits they include.\n\nThe full package of employee benefits, including dental and vision care, is worth between $34,162 and $34,652 for family coverage and between $12,627 and $12,842 for individual coverage. The Cadillac tax threshold is based on major medical premiums and prescription premiums \u2013 not vision or dental care \u2013 however those costs would also be above the federal limits. For medical and prescription coverage alone, township employee plans range from $29,032 to $33,124 for family coverage and $10,779 and $12,254 for individual plans. There are also plans for two adults, one parent and one child, and parents and multiple children, all of which are over the limit.\n\nPezarras said though there are estimates available, the exact impact of the Cadillac tax is yet to be known, since the Affordable Care Act includes language that bases limits on the consumer price index.\n\nDucey said the township recently asked employees if they would be interested in taking lower-cost plans to reduce their own contributions to their medical insurance as well as the town\u2019s cost, and no employees took the offer.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no more free lunch, the township can\u2019t afford it,\u201d said resident George Scott.\n\n\u201cFor us to try to offer something less than what we offer now is something that would have to be negotiated,\u201d said Business Administrator Joanne Bergin.\n\nThis year, Brick\u2019s medical insurance costs are rising by 9 percent and prescription costs are rising by a staggering 34 percent.\n\nLarry Reid, who as a member of the school board until 2015 was able to spearhead a reduction to the district\u2019s health insurance premiums, suggested the township get tougher in negotiations with union bargaining units. Currently, the township\u2019s negotiating team consists of township employees, which he feels is a conflict of interest.\n\n\u201cYou have town employees negotiating with town employees,\u201d said Reid. \u201cYou really don\u2019t have a fair negotiation. When we had negotiations on the school board, we had school board members negotiating against the unions.\u201d\n\n\u201cI believe in keeping promises, but the promises made on health care in these towns across the state are unaffordable and unsustainable,\u201d Reid continued. \u201cThe union people vote out anybody who doesn\u2019t give them everything they want. To negotiate hard against them is difficult.\u201d\n\nNo one spoke in favor of maintaining the benefits packages. Public employee unions have often argued that their members contribute to the cost of their health care packages and have made concessions to pay larger percentages in recent years. Union leaders have also said that private employees should be protesting cuts to their own insurance rather than favoring expanded cuts to public employees\u2019 insurance plans. Under the state\u2019s 2011 benefits reform law, public employees contribute a set percentage toward theirs benefits\u2019 cost, depending on their salary. The contributions range from 3 percent for employees who make less than $20,000 to 35 percent for employees who earn over $90,000.\n\nThe $600,000 figure represents only the municipal impact of the Cadillac tax. It is likely that school employees\u2019 plans also exceed the threshold.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Residents angered by cost of employee benefits packages, speak out at township council meeting...", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Daniel Nee", "og": {"site_name": "Brick, NJ Shorebeat -- News, Real Estate, Events, Community, Sports, Business", "description": "Residents angered by cost of employee benefits packages, speak out at township council meeting...", "title": "Brick Residents Could Face $600K Tax For 'Cadillac' Employee Benefits", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://brick.shorebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/DSC_0129.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-25T04:46:34+00:00", "url": "http://brick.shorebeat.com/2016/02/brick-residents-could-face-600k-tax-for-cadillac-employee-benefits/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Brick Residents Could Face $600K Tax For 'Cadillac' Employee Benefits"}, "fb": {"admins": 28806488}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/brickshorebeat", "section": "Government", "published_time": "2016-02-25T01:36:38+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-25T04:46:34+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/daniel.nee.92"}, "viewport": "width=1045"}, "article_summary": "They want you to get rid of Cadillac benefits because nobody can afford them anymore.\n\u201cMy taxes are going to go up because of someone\u2019s Cadillac benefits,\u201d said resident Vic Fanneli, addressing township council members.\nUnion leaders have also said that private employees should be protesting cuts to their own insurance rather than favoring expanded cuts to public employees\u2019 insurance plans.\nThe $600,000 figure represents only the municipal impact of the Cadillac tax.\nThis year, Brick\u2019s medical insurance costs are rising by 9 percent and prescription costs are rising by a staggering 34 percent."}
