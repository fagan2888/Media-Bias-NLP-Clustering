In Pew\u2019s survey, just 19 percent said they can trust the government \u201calways or most of the time.\u201d And 55 percent said that \u201cordinary Americans\u201d would do a better job of solving national problems than elected officials.\n\nA new Gallup survey out this week found that just four in 10 Americans rate the \u201ccurrent situation\u201d in the U.S. as positive, which is well below historical averages.\n\nGallup for decades has been asking Americans to assess how things were going in general, on a scale from one to 10. What they found this time is that Americans are feeling just a tad better than they did just before President Richard M. Nixon resigned in the Watergate scandal in 1974.\n\nRelated: Trump vs. Sanders? Get Ready for a Populist Disaster\n\nGallup speculates that this has to do with Americans\u2019 rampant dissatisfaction with their government and continued concerns about the uneven economic recovery and the threat of terrorism.\n\nSlightly over half of Americans disapprove of President Obama\u2019s job performance, but approval for Congress is just 11 percent. And as Gallup noted, Democrats are \u201csharply more positive\u201d than Republicans and independents in assessing the current state of things.\n\nIt has become a clich\u00e9 of the 2016 presidential campaign that billionaire Donald Trump has tapped into voter discontent and revulsion with the political status quo \u2014 and into some voters\u2019 hatred of immigrants and others they view as a threat to their economic well being \u2014 and that Trump may ride that wave all the way to the Republican National Convention this summer.\n\nThere is plenty of polling data to back up that scenario.\n\nRelated: 20 Picks For Trump's Vice President\n\nA Washington Post/ABC News poll out this week found Republicans in a substantially sour mood and predisposed to vote for Trump beginning with next Monday\u2019s Iowa caucuses.\n\nNearly 90 percent of the Republicans surveyed nationwide said the country is \u201cpretty seriously off on the wrong track\u201d and are dissatisfied with the way the government works. They believe Trump when he castigates government officials as \u201cstupid\u201d \u2014 and that includes the president and congressional leaders.\n\nMore importantly, two-thirds of the Republicans surveyed fret about maintaining their current standard of living, and a majority said that people with similar values to their own are losing influence. About half say the country\u2019s best days are behind it.\n\nRelated: If Michael Bloomberg Enters the Race, He Could Help Trump\n\nTrump now receives the support of 37 percent of registered Republicans, putting him far ahead of his nearest rival, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, who has just 21 percent, and Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, who garnered 11 percent of the vote.\n\nTrump also is ahead with practically all demographic groups, including white evangelical Christians, those with incomes below $50,000 a year and those lacking a college degree.\n\nBut notably, the bombastic former reality TV host scores best among those voters \u201cdissatisfied with government and the country\u2019s direction,\u201d according to The Post.\n\nIn short, these are the best of times for Trump.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "By now you probably know that Americans \u2014 especially Republicans \u2014 are in a lousy mood", "title": "Trump Is Up in the Polls Because Americans Are Down in the Dumps", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/01/28/Trump-Polls-Because-Americans-Are-Down-Dumps", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-election-trump_4.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/01/28/Trump-Polls-Because-Americans-Are-Down-Dumps", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-election-trump_4.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "By now you probably know that Americans \u2014 especially Republicans \u2014 are in a lousy mood", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Slightly over half of Americans disapprove of President Obama\u2019s job performance, but approval for Congress is just 11 percent.\nThey believe Trump when he castigates government officials as \u201cstupid\u201d \u2014 and that includes the president and congressional leaders.\nGallup for decades has been asking Americans to assess how things were going in general, on a scale from one to 10.\nIn short, these are the best of times for Trump.\nTrump also is ahead with practically all demographic groups, including white evangelical Christians, those with incomes below $50,000 a year and those lacking a college degree."}
