When I get on an airplane, the last thing I want to hear from the pilot is, 'I really don't have a plan, I've never flown an airplane before, so just bear with me and trust me,\" said Stenehjem.\n\nThe North Dakota Republican Party trusts Stenehjem, as he was elected to be the party's endorsed candidate for governor at the convention in April.\n\n\"Those are the people who are the volunteers, who are the most active in the Republican party, who decided that I was worthy of their endorsement and of course I'm very proud to have it,\" said Stenehjem.\n\nThe party wants Stenehjem to lead them through this period of low oil and low agriculture prices.\n\n\"This gives us a perfect opportunity to really build on diversifying our economy so we're not just reliant on ag and energy, though they're critically important,\" said Stenehjem.\n\nDespite the downturn, Stenehjem remains optimistic.\n\n\"The situation remains really good and there's never been a better time to live here than right here, right now,\" said Stenehjem.\n\nWith the challenge of establishment versus outsider in June, the primary may well be a referendum on that very statement.\n\nStenehjem says that North Dakota must continue marketing its agriculture to a global market to stay competitive.\n\nOn health care, Stenehjem says he opposes Obamacare, however, he said he is in favor of guaranteed insurability and letting kids stay on their parent's coverage until they're 26. He says congress missed the boat by failing to address the overall cost of the country's health care system.\u200b", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "On June 14, North Dakota Republicans will go to the polls to decide who will represent them in November's election for governor.", "language": "english", "author": "Max Grossfeld", "og": {"description": "On June 14, North Dakota Republicans will go to the polls to decide who will represent them in November's election for governor.", "title": "Stenehjem Pitches Why He Deserves Your Vote for ND Governor", "url": "http://www.kfyrtv.com/home/headlines/Stenejhem-Striving-for-Republican-Gubernatorial--380569801.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/D8E/81E/D8E81E6ED4374C9B9F27CC6C2FF7D4BE", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/7F3/9A7/7F39A7573D784C4DB6D8AE859C5584E7.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kfyrtv.com", "description": "On June 14, North Dakota Republicans will go to the polls to decide who will represent them in November's election for governor.", "title": "Stenehjem Pitches Why He Deserves Your Vote for ND Governor", "url": "http://www.kfyrtv.com/home/headlines/Stenejhem-Striving-for-Republican-Gubernatorial--380569801.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/Stenehjem1.png", "creator": "@KFYRTV", "site": "@KFYRTV", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Stenehjem Pitches Why He Deserves Your Vote for ND Governor", "google-site-verification": "7X3c07pzYBm0VR8bvx_HRCZFSOo-xfwVVm9pthNDsMM", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Stenehjem Pitches Why He Deserves, Your Vote for ND Governor"}, "article_summary": "On June 14, North Dakota Republicans will go to the polls to decide who will represent them in November's election for governor.\nThe North Dakota Republican Party trusts Stenehjem, as he was elected to be the party's endorsed candidate for governor at the convention in April.\nStenehjem says that North Dakota must continue marketing its agriculture to a global market to stay competitive.\nAfter 40 years of experience at the Capitol, The Memorial Hall of the People is Wayne Stenehjem's home turf.\nNow, we get Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem's take."}
