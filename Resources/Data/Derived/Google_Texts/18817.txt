Everywhere you look, old shows are coming back to televisions.

"Boy Meets World" has been updated to "Girl Meets World."

Then there was the recent "X Files" announcement.

Now, Uncle Jessie, Danny Tanner and Joey will be back, at least according to rumors reported by TVline.com.

The entertainment site quoted sources, that Netflix will bring back the family sitcom "Full House" as "Fuller House," a 13 episode series starring Candace Cameron Bure reprising her role as DJ and Andrea Barber as her best friend Kimmy.

John Stamos, Bob Saget and Dave Coulier may make guest shots in the show. Stamos is expected to have a producer role also.

Warner Bros. and Netflix have not confirmed the show's return.

Access Hollywood said this is not the first time there has been a "Full House" reunion. In 2014, Stamos, Saget and Coulier reprised their roles for a Dannon Oikos Super Bowl ad. They also appeared on Jimmy Fallon's show for a reunion skit.

Cameron Bure and Barber have stayed friends since the series ended. They recently competed in a "Tough Mudder" event together.

Meanwhile, John Stamos posted this possibly cryptic post on his Twitter account after the rumors came out. Was he referring to the Netflix plans?
