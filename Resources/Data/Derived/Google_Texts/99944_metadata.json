(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)\n\n3857152\n\nBankrupting America has made a six-figure online ad buy slamming Congress\u2019 Obamacare exemption, concluding that lawmakers are \u201cjust like you, unless it\u2019s inconvenient.\u201d\n\nThe national online ad campaign, titled \u201cInconvenient,\u201d argues that Congress \u201cshould live with the laws it passes.\u201d\n\nBankrupting America, an educational project of spending-hawk nonprofit Public Notice, released the ad Monday and will air it as a pre-roll video on sites like YouTube, Facebook and Pandora.\n\nThe group\u2019s executive director, Gretchen Hamel, charged that \u201cwe elected our leaders in Washington to represent us and our best interests, but right now it appears they\u2019re only concerned about their own pocketbooks.\u201d\n\nLouisiana Republican Sen. David Vitter has proposed an amendment to an unrelated energy bill that would end the subsidies for lawmakers and their staffers. Members of Congress and Hill staffers were forced to participate in the Obamacare exchanges in the first place by an amendment to the Affordable Care Act by Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley.\n\nMany of the people affected by the amendment make too much money to receive subsidies already available under Obamacare, so their costs would have risen compared to their previous coverage. The White House Office of Personnel Management ruled members of Congress and their staff would receive their own subsidies after Congress began to panic about a \u201cbrain drain\u201d of staffer resources as a result.\n\nPublic Notice spokesman Bill Riggs told The Daily Caller News Foundation that though Congress allowed Grassley\u2019s amendment to pass, \u201conce they realized how the law impacted them \u2014 like many Americans \u2014 they wanted no part of it.\u201d\n\nVitter has had to fight just to get a vote on his proposal. Meanwhile, Democrats have offered several vindictive counter-amendments, including one banning the subsidies to any member found to have visited a prostitute \u2014 a jab at Vitter\u2019s 2007 D.C. madam controversy \u2014 or to anyone who votes for Vitter\u2019s amendment, even if it fails.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid has denied that Congress is getting any special treatment that the average consumer won\u2019t.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing unique that employers help pay for health care,\u201d Reid said at a press conference Thursday.\n\nCritics maintain that Congress will be more open to Obamacare reforms if lawmakers and their employees are forced to experience the full costs.\n\nPublic Notice says it is launching its advertising campaign because it just wants Congress subjected to the same laws as the rest of us. \u201cAmericans will pay the price for this ill-conceived law and deserve to know whether their representatives will as well,\u201d Hamel concluded.\n\nFollow Sarah on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
