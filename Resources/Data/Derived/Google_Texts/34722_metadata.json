But there is one problem: Trump helped finance the Democratic takeover of Congress in 2006 \u2014 which put in place the liberal majority that passed Obamacare over the objections of congressional Republicans. And he continued to support a Democratic Senate majority after Obamacare.\n\nAs Trump knows, money talks \u2014 and Trump has given more than $100,000 to the Democratic House and Senate campaign committees. In 2006 \u2014 the year Democrats took back Congress \u2014 he gave $25,000 to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (while his son Donald Trump Jr. gave $22,500). They gave Republican committees just $1,000 that year.\n\nIn other words, Trump wanted Nancy Pelosi to be speaker of the House and Harry Reid the Senate majority leader.\n\nWhich is not surprising. At the time he made those contributions, from August 2001 to September 2009, Trump was a registered Democrat. (He had been registered in New York first as a Republican, then a member of the Independence Party, then a Democrat, then a Republican again, and then became unaffiliated.)\n\nSo maybe he came to regret it after Reid and Pelosi rammed through Obamacare? Apparently not. In 2010 \u2014 immediately after the passage of Obamacare \u2014 Trump continued to donate to Reid. Trump has donated at least $10,400 to Reid, including $4,800 for his 2010 race against Sharron Angle \u2014 a victory that helped keep the Senate in Democratic hands and Reid as majority leader. So Trump continued to support Reid as majority leader in the election immediately after the passage of Obamacare.\n\nIn his home state of New York, Trump also donated disproportionately to Democrats. The Post reported in 2011 that \u201cThe biggest recipient of all has been the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee of New York, which has taken in more than $125,000 from Trump and his companies. Overall, Trump has given nearly $600,000 to New York state campaigns, with more than two-thirds going to Democrats.\u201d He even boasted of it. \u201cSo, what am I going to do, contribute to Republicans?\u201d he told Fox News\u2019S Sean Hannity. \u201cI mean, one thing I\u2019m not stupid. Am I going to contribute to a Republican for my whole life when they get, they run against some Democrat. And the most they can get is one percent of the vote?\u201d\n\nTrump also gave $50,000 to another Obamacare architect, Rahm Emanuel \u2014 the former Obama White House chief of staff \u2014 for his campaign to become mayor of Chicago. He gave $5,500 to John Kerry and $7,000 to the late liberal icon of the Senate, Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.). Other Democrats who have benefited from Trump\u2019s largesse include Sen. Charles Schumer (N.Y.), Sen. Frank Lautenberg (N.J.), Rep. Charlie Rangel (N.Y.) and Sen. Hillary Clinton (N.Y.). A major issue in the 2016 election will be allegations of corruption surrounding donations to the Clinton Foundation. But it will also be hard for Trump to make an issue of that since he gave at least $100,000 to the Clinton Foundation.\n\nYes, Trump has given to Republicans, too, especially since he started toying with the idea of running for the Republican nomination. But Trump expresses disdain for the GOP field. He told Bill O\u2019Reilly last week, \u201cWell , I don\u2019t have a lot of respect for many of them.\u201d\n\nWith all his past support for Democrats, Trump ought to be asked: Will he commit to supporting whoever is the eventual Republican nominee? After all, why should he be welcomed into the Republican fold if he is going to end up throwing his support to Clinton?\n\nThe fact is, Trump isn\u2019t a Democrat or a Republican \u2014 he is an opportunist. He\u2019s less a candidate than a brand. And running for president is great for the Trump brand, an opportunity for Donald Trump to take the national stage and tell us all how great he is. He pretty much admitted as much during his announcement speech, when he pointed out that some questioned whether he was really as successful as he claimed. \u201cSo I said to myself, you know, nobody\u2019s ever going to know unless I run, because I\u2019m really proud of my success,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI really am.\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t say.\n\nRead more from Marc Thiessen\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.", "article_metadata": {"description": "He\u2019s an opportunist, not a candidate.", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/marcthiessen", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "He\u2019s an opportunist, not a candidate.", "title": "How Donald Trump helped Democrats pass Obamacare", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/how-donald-trump-helped-democrats-pass-obamacare/2015/06/22/002f4c7c-18ea-11e5-ab92-c75ae6ab94b5_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/06/22/Editorial-Opinion/Images/GOP_2016_Trump-0b10d.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@marcthiessen"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/how-donald-trump-helped-democrats-pass-obamacare/2015/06/22/002f4c7c-18ea-11e5-ab92-c75ae6ab94b5_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Marc Thiessen, donald trump, donald trump 2016, donald trump donations to democrats, donald trump donations, donald trump democrats", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/marcthiessen"}, "eomportal-uuid": "002f4c7c-18ea-11e5-ab92-c75ae6ab94b5", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "Marc Thiessen, donald trump, donald trump 2016, donald trump donations to democrats, donald trump donations, donald trump democrats"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbee3\"", "article_summary": "As Trump knows, money talks \u2014 and Trump has given more than $100,000 to the Democratic House and Senate campaign committees.\n\u201cWe have a disaster called the big lie: Obamacare,\u201d Trump declared.\nAnd he continued to support a Democratic Senate majority after Obamacare.\nIn 2010 \u2014 immediately after the passage of Obamacare \u2014 Trump continued to donate to Reid.\nIn other words, Trump wanted Nancy Pelosi to be speaker of the House and Harry Reid the Senate majority leader."}
