Mark Dayton and U.S. Sen. All Franken.\n\n\u2013 More than half of Minnesotans say first-term Democratic U.S. Sen. Al Franken is doing a good job, according to a new Star Tribune Minnesota Poll.\n\nThe 55 percent approval rating for the satirist-turned-senator matches a high-water mark reached last June, but the latest results also show a growing dissatisfaction with his job performance.\n\nFranken\u2019s job disapproval rating has climbed to 34 percent, up from 29 percent last June.\n\nThe election that put Franken in office in 2008 was one of the tightest in the nation, with a victory margin of just several hundred votes over former U.S. Sen. Norm Coleman.\n\nSince then, Franken has cultivated a low profile on Capitol Hill, opting not to capitalize on his fame from his days as a \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d star and liberal radio host.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s already famous. He\u2019s not in it for that,\u201d said Jane Masterman, 49, a Woodbury Democrat who works as an administrative assistant for a Twin Cities nonprofit. \u201cHe\u2019s committed. He works hard. He listens to the little guys.\u201d\n\nSen. Al Franken\n\nNot all Minnesotans agree, and some still harbor resentment from the 2008 election.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t stand him. He got into office with a fake election,\u201d said Cheryl Kop, 62, a Moose Lake Republican and small-business owner. She considers him an out-of-touch liberal. \u201cIt\u2019s just a joke this state elected him,\u201d she said.\n\nThe poll, conducted by Mason-Dixon Polling and Research Inc., interviewed 800 Minnesota adults Feb. 10-12, by land line and cellphones, and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.\n\nFranken\u2019s job approval numbers are highest in the Democratic strongholds of Hennepin and Ramsey counties, where 68 percent approve of the work he has done in Congress.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not treated this comically in any way,\u201d said Judy Parkin, 67, a St. Paul Democrat and social worker. \u201cHe has not been involved in the silliness of trying to shut down the government.\u201d\n\nIn the metro suburbs, Franken\u2019s approval stands at 58 percent. Outstate, however, his approval rating dips sharply to 42 percent.\n\nFranken remains a polarizing figure, with job approval ratings of 97 percent from Democrats, but a 71 percent disapproval from Republicans. Both numbers have spiked since the last poll.\n\nIndependents are divided, but leaning against him, with 42 percent disapproving of the job he\u2019s done and 38 percent approving.\n\nBill Conlin, 47, is a Shoreview independent who voted for Franken in 2008 and is among the 38 percent of independents approving of Franken\u2019s work. \u201cHe\u2019s done a good job of trying to get himself in a position where he knows the issues,\u201d said Conlin, a business administrator.\n\nDivergent paths\n\nFranken was among the eight Democrats who captured Senate seats that had been in Republican hands when President Obama swept to election in 2008. Those senators are now defending themselves from attacks based on their support for the Affordable Care Act, Obama\u2019s health care law.\n\nObama and Franken\u2019s in-state political fortunes have diverged. Since a Minnesota Poll conducted in fall 2009, Franken\u2019s job approval rating has shot up 14 percentage points to 55 percent, while Obama\u2019s has fallen 7 points to 44 percent.\n\n\u201cSen. Franken promised Minnesotans he would work hard for them every day, and that\u2019s what he\u2019s done,\u201d said Franken campaign spokeswoman Alexandra Fetissoff. \u201cMinnesotans know he\u2019s kept his word and that he\u2019s going to keep fighting on their behalf.\u201d\n\nCambridge Democrat Christine Burlingame, 61, said Franken\u2019s push to restore emergency federal unemployment benefits has impressed her. She can relate to the thousands of Minnesotans whose benefits expired at the end of 2013. Burlingame now works in credit collections, but went through a 27-month period when she couldn\u2019t find a job.\n\n\u201c[Franken] just strikes me as being honest, and that can be a rare thing for politicians,\u201d Burlingame said.\n\nNicole Monaghan, 44, a Carver Republican, considers Franken an opportunist.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about Al, and isn\u2019t always about the people,\u201d said Monaghan, a homemaker and former social studies teacher.\n\nAsked whether they had a favorable or unfavorable opinion of him, 38 percent of poll respondents view him favorably, but 30 percent view him negatively. Nearly a third are neutral.\n\nCharles Shreffler, 58, a Bloomington Republican, has followed Franken\u2019s work on privacy issues.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been a good advocate for citizens,\u201d said Shreffler, an attorney.\n\nBut Franken hasn\u2019t done enough to win over Shreffler, whose vote will to go one of four Republicans vying for the GOP nomination to take on Franken. \u201cThe Republican candidate is going to be closer to my fundamental beliefs,\u201d Shreffler said.\n\nConlin, the independent voter from Shoreview, said he faced a difficult choice between Franken and Coleman in 2008 and may encounter a similar dilemma this fall.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know who the Republicans are running against [Franken],\u201d Conlin said. \u201cI\u2019ll have to weigh my options. He\u2019s not a slam dunk.\u201d\n\nCorey Mitchell is a correspondent in the Star Tribune Washington Bureau.
