It\u2019s inescapable; the ads even come up on Google searches and the Words with Friends app. Indeed, it\u2019s such a barrage of rhetoric that one would think abortion, an issue the U.S. Supreme Court decided in 1973, is on the ballot.\n\nNot quite.\n\nAbortion, birth control and \u201cpersonhood\u201d \u2014 another way of saying life begins at conception \u2014 are indeed front and center in Colorado\u2019s U.S. Senate race between incumbent Mark Udall, a Democrat, and challenger Cory Gardner, a Republican who gave up his seat in Congress to run.\n\nAnd, since the abortion debate rarely takes a time out, there\u2019s a ballot measure seeking to change Colorado\u2019s criminal code to allow prosecutors to file homicide charges in cases involving the deaths of pregnant women \u2014 and their unborn children.\n\nIntimate topics usually shared only with a gynecologist have become so much a part of this campaign that pundits have dubbed Udall \u201cMark Uterus.\u201d A spoof \u201cMark Uterus\u201d Twitter account boasts 324 followers.\n\nVajayjay politics has some women in Colorado fired up. Others are fed up.\n\nThe reaction depends on whether the fight is seen through a baby boomer\u2019s eyes, or a millennial\u2019s. A boomer remembers when abortion was illegal and her contemporaries marched and burned their bras; a millennial isn\u2019t interested in ancient \u201cherstory.\u201d\n\nWhat so far seems to have eluded both Senate campaigns is that there are other issues of concern to women: Good schools and jobs, equal pay for performing the same work as men, the ability to set a little money aside for the future, decent opportunities for the kids and grandkids. Most want to see the next generation live as well as they do but question whether that\u2019s possible.\n\nNowhere is that more evident than in suburban Lakewood, a sprawling mashup of gated subdivisions, office parks and working-class ranch houses in the heart of Jefferson County, just west of Denver. There\u2019s prosperity here, with few outwardly visible signs of hard times. One might not find a cutesy-pie village, but the city\u2019s Belmar Center boasts a Whole Foods Market with its own multilevel parking deck.\n\nJeffCo, as it is locally known, has become ground zero for the U.S. Senate. Half a million people live here, including 181,303 active female voters who are of no small significance because in past elections, they always showed up.\n\nThe Colorado Senate race is now a dead heat, making JeffCo the biggest swing county in the biggest swing state in the nation. This place could actually decide whether Democrats or Republicans control the Senate.\n\n\u201cThe classic logic has always been as goes JeffCo, so goes Colorado and as goes Colorado, so goes the nation,\u201d says Kelly Maher, a 31-year-old political consultant from Denver. She went to high school in Jefferson County, leans to the right, and sparred with \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d host Jon Stewart and survived.\n\nMaher invited me to The University Club, a members-only haunt a block or two from the state Capitol in Denver, for some tea and spin. She is convinced that Jefferson County could be The Decider.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an interesting place to be,\u201d she said between sips.\n\nPerhaps, but I didn\u2019t see hide nor hair of either Senate candidate last week in Lakewood. Battleground, schmattleground. Time to get out there and meet these swing state women for myself.\n\nAs I plotted my visit, Udall, with his entourage of Planned Parenthood and other abortion rights supporters, played to his base; he mainly stuck to Boulder and Denver, including an event on Tuesday with Hillary Clinton.\n\nGardner also tended his base in conservative western Colorado, with the occasional appearance in Denver. But at least Gardner, who favors over-the-counter birth control but opposes abortion, had plans to go to a Jefferson County event.\n\nUdall handily won JeffCo when he last ran in 2008. That year, 73% of the women eligible to vote in Colorado registered, and 69% actually went to the polls. Two years later, JeffCo also went for another Democrat, Mike Bennet, Colorado\u2019s junior senator.\n\nAh, but is change in the air?\n\nRepublicans are hoping to gain traction from what Maher and others see as an \u201cObama backlash\u201d and a second-term president\u2019s declining popularity. They also hope to capitalize on dissatisfaction with the sluggish economy and jitters over the Ebola virus and a volatile situation in the Mideast.\n\nIndeed, the Republican and unaffiliated female voters I met cited Ebola and ISIS as top among their concerns, while the Democrats talked about the environment and sustainability. The issues of education and the economy crossed party lines.\n\nJeffCo: Colorado in microcosm\n\nIn many ways JeffCo is Colorado in microcosm. Its voters are 37% unaffiliated, 32% Republican and 30% Democrat. The county has voted for every U.S. Senate winner since 1992.\n\nThe quest to learn what Jefferson County\u2019s women really want began with get-out-the-vote worker Natalie Menten. You want to take the pulse of the suburbs? Go to the dog park, she advised.\n\nThere, along with the bulldogs, Labrador retrievers and huskies, I found Mary Lovit, 39, an unaffiliated voter who favors Udall, and Ammorette Trujillo, 21, a single mom and Democrat who says she\u2019s so turned off by the ob-gyn nature of the ads invading the morning shows that she won\u2019t be voting.\n\nMenten isn\u2019t your stereotypical country club Republican. She drives an older red compact festooned with libertarian bumper stickers. So it comes as no surprise that the women she knows aren\u2019t suburban Stepford wives. Her next stop was a candidate meet-and-greet night for Jane Barnes, a former JeffCo school board chair who\u2019s running for state representative on the Republican ticket.\n\nColorado leads the nation in electing women to the statehouse, with 41%. But the state has never seen a woman serve as governor or U.S. senator.\n\nMenten, Barnes and three of her supporters huddled around a table and talked long after the event at the restaurant ended. Barnes was the only Republican; the others were defecting Democrats who don\u2019t always toe the party line. They\u2019d recruited a newly registered voter with no party affiliation.\n\nAll in their 50s and 60s, they called themselves \u201cthe Saturday night bridge club\u201d because the restaurant stood in the shadow of what locals call the Sixth Avenue Freeway.\n\nTheir \u201cbridge\u201d was an overpass.\n\nAmong them, they have five kids, all grown. Two of the women are newly retired and have been counting pennies for too long. They expected to enjoy the fruits of a lifetime of hard work by now. But things keep getting harder. This isn\u2019t what they signed up for.\n\nLois Florkey, who runs a pest control company with her husband, and Susan McConnell, a retired middle school secretary, voted for Barack Obama and Mark Udall the first time around. They say they\u2019ve been disappointed.\n\nMcConnell was the first to defect and cross the party line as the recession kicked everyone in the teeth. She voted for Mitt Romney in 2012. Now she\u2019s bringing her friends with her to Gardner.\n\n\u201cI want grandkids. I want security. I don\u2019t want to worry about paying the bills,\u201d she said. She remembers being inspired by Gloria Steinem and the feminists of the 1970s and counts herself among them. But, she says, Udall is \u201cpandering on the choice issue, trying to scare women. I don\u2019t scare anymore. I\u2019m beyond that.\u201d\n\nFlorkey also considers herself a feminist, but that is no longer her primary issue.\n\n\u201cI am a pro-choice woman,\u201d she said. \u201cPerhaps at a point in my life, that was a No. 1 issue for me. But in the last 20 years it has become more and more about the economy and education.\u201d\n\nAbortion: The new civil rights issue?\n\nA few days later, I came across another gathering of JeffCo women, this time on the back porch of state Rep. Brittany Pettersen. At 32, she is the youngest woman in Colorado\u2019s statehouse. She worked her way up, practically raising herself with help from her teachers and grandmother. She put herself though college by working as a cocktail waitress.\n\nHer first campaign cost close to $1 million, but she beat a popular male candidate. She\u2019s seeking a second term in a swing-prone district heavy with older voters.\n\nThe group of loyal Dems assembled on her patio ranged in age from 30 to 70. All favored a woman\u2019s right to choose whether to have an abortion.\n\nChristine Laursen, a 51-year-old teacher with a master\u2019s degree, is single but feels like she works nonstop just to pay the bills. She\u2019s always looking to pick up freelance projects to earn a little extra cash. Statewide statistics might help explain why she always feels like she\u2019s about to slip underwater: Women make 20% less than men doing the same work.\n\nWomen make up half of Colorado\u2019s work force, but a third of them would qualify as working poor.\n\nSeated next to her was Cindy Lay, 66, a hospital emergency room trainer who represents another of Colorado\u2019s grim statistics: One in four women over 18 has been raped.\n\nWhen she was 36, Lay says, several men abducted her, kept her in a closet for days and repeatedly raped her at knifepoint. She never saw their faces, and police never brought charges. But afterward, she became a fierce advocate for Planned Parenthood and other groups fighting for abortion rights.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the next civil rights issue in this country \u2014 women getting and continuing our rights and not having them be jeopardized every time somebody wants to make a political point,\u201d she declared, before leaving to make more cold calls to voters.\n\nAnd then there was Kathy Tolman, 70, a retired nurse who worked two jobs to raise four kids on her own after her husband died. The statistics say she supported those kids on 63% of what she would have earned if she were a single dad.\n\nNot surprisingly, her political concerns focused on survival \u2014 economically, environmentally and geo-politically. She is horrified by what she views as the racism that dogged President Obama and wonders whether the country is ready for a woman at the helm. \u201cHillary, what would she be up against? Would it be insurmountable?\u201d\n\nShe is disgusted by the Senate commercials and the focus on abortion. \u201cThis is so ignorant, it just drives me crazy,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s none of their business. That should be between a woman and her doctor.\u201d\n\nA different kind of Democrat\n\nWhere were the Republican women who opposed abortion?\n\nThe search took me to a leafy section of Denver and the very calm, likable 30-year-old Meghan Marsden. We met for conversation and cucumber bubbly water at the uber-cool Denver Bicycle Caf\u00e9.\n\nOriginally from Minnesota, Marsden hails from a long line of Democrats going back to FDR and JFK. \u201cI think that is a different Democrat than it is today,\u201d she says, opening my eyes to a millennial reality. Where are today\u2019s inspirational figures?\n\nHailing as I reluctantly do from the South, where highway billboards feature cute babies and aborted fetuses, I relaxed immediately in Marsden\u2019s calming presence. Yes, she is a Christian and her faith is a big part of her life. That was no secret, given the tiny gold chain that circled her neck with the word \u201cblessed\u201d in a graceful gold script.\n\nShe is a Republican, believes life begins at conception, and opposes abortion.\n\nBut Marsden says she came to her position after lots of thought. It\u2019s personal, not dogmatic. It\u2019s also not her only issue, although she\u2019s firmly in Gardner\u2019s camp. She also likes what he has to say about small businesses.\n\nThe first member of her family to graduate college, Marsden still believes in the up-by-your-bootstraps dream. It is her family\u2019s story.\n\n\u201cMy parents worked up from nothing to be upper middle class people, and that\u2019s why I am who I am,\u201d she says. \u201cI believe in the American dream, small business, if you keep your head down and work hard, it will happen.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s still possible, but it\u2019s harder than it has ever been. It\u2019s not the 1980s.\u201d\n\nAsk Marsden about feminism, and it\u2019s not the 1970s, either. Like many women her age, she thinks the word is outdated and carries too much baggage.\n\n\u201cWhen I think of the word \u2018feminist,\u2019 I think of the \u201970s. I think of textbook history,\u201d she says. \u201cI think being a strong woman is more descriptive than being a feminist. I think there are strong negative connotations to being a feminist, still, that it was this bra-burning movement that happened before my time. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a modern equivalent for what that word is meant to mean. I don\u2019t think that word exists yet.\u201d\n\nShe also thinks women are unnecessarily competitive.\n\n\u201cThere is no old girls\u2019 network,\u201d she says. \u201cI think a lot of it is based on fear, fear that there is only one spot for a woman. I\u2019m competing against that one woman, instead of saying, \u2018That\u2019s awesome you got there; teach me how you got there.\u2019\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still a man\u2019s game, you just can\u2019t say it. I think it might even be harder today.\u201d\n\nTurning blue\n\nKelly Maher, the 31-year-old political consultant, moves easily along the corridors of male power and considers herself a feminist, although she doesn\u2019t dwell on it.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t wake up every morning and think, \u2018I am woman, hear me roar,'\u201d she says. \u201cI believe I\u2019m equal to a man and as good as a man at doing the same things. And I\u2019m disappointed that the term feminist has been taken over by people who want to inherently weaken my gender.\u201d\n\nSister, say what?\n\nIt\u2019s Maher\u2019s opinion that the Udall campaign\u2019s focus on women\u2019s issues is actually condescending to women. She thinks it\u2019s pandering, a page ripped from a two-year-old campaign playbook.\n\nClearly, I needed to learn more about the millennial mindset. It was just the two of us, liberal boomer and conservative millennial, sharing a bottomless pitcher of iced tea on the terrace of a members-only club that used to cater to Denver\u2019s old boys\u2019 network. The sun was shining and golden leaves were falling from the trees. It was the perfect afternoon for a primer on Millennial She-Politics.\n\nOnce upon a time, not so long ago, Maher explained, Colorado was as red as a state could be. Then came the backlash after the two terms of the second President Bush; by 2010 both U.S. Senate seats, the governor\u2019s office and five of the seven representatives in Congress were Dems.\n\nAlmost overnight, Colorado wasn\u2019t even purple; it was blue.\n\nWomen\u2019s issues played a huge role in the 2010 Senate race, with Republican Ken Buck, a Princeton grad and former prosecutor and abortion opponent, portrayed as \u201ctoo extreme for Colorado.\u201d Dem Michael Bennet won big with women and Team Blue got a page for its playbook.\n\nUdall has always received support from women\u2019s and abortion rights groups. When Gardner, who had backed \u201cpersonhood\u201d bills in the past, tried to distance himself from the issue, Udall\u2019s campaign zeroed in with laser-like focus on women\u2019s issues and hasn\u2019t let up. Maher believes that strategy may ultimately backfire.\n\nIndeed, The Denver Post endorsed Gardner and slammed Udall over an \u201cobnoxious one-issue campaign\u201d that the newspaper called \u201d an insult to those he seeks to convince.\u201d The Post received dozens of letters from readers; liberal, women\u2019s and abortion rights groups pressured the paper to reconsider, and other pundits poked fun.\n\n\u201cEveryone is just running on the uterus issues, if you will,\u201d Maher says. \u201cThe Senate race is going to be a really good litmus test for whether or not that has jumped the shark. I believe it has, especially with millennial women.\u201d\n\nShe explains a key millennial tenet: \u201cTrying to carve out special rights and look for some kind of special consideration by virtue of your gender is inherently anti-feminist.\u201d\n\nShe also explained why Meghan Marsden so surprised me. She was thoroughly modern Meghan. There was absolutely nothing backward about her.\n\n\u201cMillennial women are more pro-life than our parents,\u201d Maher explained. \u201cYou can\u2019t look at a girl who always had access to birth control, who grew up with a mother who was on the pill and say, \u2018XYZ is going to come and take away your birth control.'\u201d\n\nWhoa! Boom. In the blink of an eye, the spin of a Senate race switched from abortion to the pill.\n\nIt\u2019s no longer 1973. It\u2019s, like, 1960.\n\nAs Yogi Berra once said: It\u2019s d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu all over again.", "article_metadata": {"description": "LAKEWOOD, Colo. -- It's election season here at the golden gateway to the Rockies, and the political talk is all lady parts, all the time.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "p": {"domain_verify": "5873d9988d745234e5abf9cff7ed939d"}, "og": {"site_name": "FOX31 Denver", "description": "LAKEWOOD, Colo. \u2014 It\u2019s election season here at the golden gateway to the Rockies, and the political talk is all lady parts, all the time.", "title": "In Colorado, \u2018vajayjay politics\u2019 aren\u2019t your mother\u2019s women\u2019s lib", "url": "http://kdvr.com/2014/11/01/in-colorado-womens-rights-a-key-but-shifting-issue/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "https://localtvkdvr.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/moms.jpg", "height": 338}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://localtvkdvr.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/moms.jpg?w=640"}, "site": "@kdvr", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@kdvr"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CC50DB4C5614EA88B5CFA75E33AAB02", "msapplication-tooltip": "Denver, Colorado News, Weather, Sports and more", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=334627011", "fb": {"pages": 90018331599}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://kdvr.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/17e52d5bd05a36821dc7d1d5f90e105c?s=16", "application-name": "FOX31 Denver", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/fox31denver", "published_time": "2014-11-01T21:16:31+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-01T21:33:11+00:00", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/fox31denver"}, "keywords": "copolitics,", "google-site-verification": "AmrqnQj74ngNWI1vn6WwMZyy9IWy4ZqooGuxLtd7lIs", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "The Colorado Senate race is now a dead heat, making JeffCo the biggest swing county in the biggest swing state in the nation.\nTime to get out there and meet these swing state women for myself.\nIndeed, it\u2019s such a barrage of rhetoric that one would think abortion, an issue the U.S. Supreme Court decided in 1973, is on the ballot.\n\u00d7 In Colorado, \u2018vajayjay politics\u2019 aren\u2019t your mother\u2019s women\u2019s libby Ann O\u2019NeillLAKEWOOD, Colo. \u2014 It\u2019s election season here at the golden gateway to the Rockies, and the political talk is all lady parts, all the time.\nVajayjay politics has some women in Colorado fired up."}
