STAR Flight did not release any information about why or how far she fell. The company uses four helicopters for rescues and emergency transport in Travis County.\n\nWoodland Park School District Re-2 confirmed on Wednesday morning with The Gazette that McClain was a 1987 graduate from Woodland Park High School in Colorado.\n\nLisa Block, a spokeswoman for Travis County Emergency Services, had few details on the circumstances of McLain\u2019s death. She said the hoist is an arm that extends off the helicopter that allows rescuers to direct a carrier to a patient and that \u201ctypically a rescuer will go with that carrier.\u201d\n\nThe helicopters usually carry three emergency personnel \u2014 a pilot, a hoist operator and a nurse or other rescuer, Block said. The nurse typically would use a harness system, she said.\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board will investigate the accident. The Associated Press has left a message with the NTSB seeking comment.\n\n\u201cSafety comes first with STAR Flight,\u201d Block said. \u201cSo of course we will be looking at everything that happened, all of our equipment, the processes to see what needs to be improved. That will also be part of the investigation. Right now our thoughts are with the family and her friends.\u201d\n\nBlock said the company has voluntarily ceased operations but could not say how long the fleet would be grounded.\n\nSTAR Flight did not identify the rescued woman but said she was taken to University Medical Center-Brackenridge in Austin with injuries that were not life-threatening. Barton Creek Greenbelt has trails for biking, running, rock climbing, swimming and hiking.\n\nWeather conditions at about the time of the rescue were clear, with temperatures in the mid-70s and winds of less than 5 mph, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nMcLain had worked for STAR Flight for seven years, was single and originally from Colorado, Block said.\n\n\u201cA lot of times STAR Flight will go to community groups and talk about what they do. She was always smiling and telling people about what she does. She was very passionate about her job,\u201d Block said.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Nurse killed in fall from Texas medical helicopter was a Colorado high school grad", "title": "Nurse killed in fall from Texas medical helicopter was a Colorado high school grad", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/04/29/nurse-killed-in-fall-from-texas-medical-helicopter-was-a-colorado-high-school-grad/", "image": {"width": 413, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150429__kristin-mcclainp1.jpg", "height": 550}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150429__kristin-mcclainp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-29T12:38:23+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-24T22:32:33+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbe4e\"", "article_summary": "\u201cA lot of times STAR Flight will go to community groups and talk about what they do.\nSTAR Flight did not release any information about why or how far she fell.\n\u201cSafety comes first with STAR Flight,\u201d Block said.\nThe nurse typically would use a harness system, she said.\nMcLain had worked for STAR Flight for seven years, was single and originally from Colorado, Block said."}
