Attorney Rick Dumas said today that he won’t campaign for a Davidson County General Sessions Court judgeship, though his name will appear on the August ballot as the Republican nominee.

Dumas, who was unopposed in last week’s GOP primary, said he’ll support Judge Rachel Bell, the Democratic nominee after winning her party’s contested primary by a 13,000-vote margin.

“After much hard thought and deliberation and discussions with Ashley, I have decided not to run for General Sessions judge,” Dumas wrote on Facebook. “There are a number of reasons, but primarily, the main reason is, is that my heart simply isn't in it. I think to make this happen, you have to be fully committed and you have to desire it greatly, and I just don’t.

“I am so grateful to everyone who has encouraged me and the offers of help I have been given. Thank you so much. Unfortunately, I don’t think I can remove my name from the ballot, so my name will still be on it in August, but I would urge you to vote for my friend Rachel Bell. I look forward to working with her over the next 8 years.”

Dumas confirmed his plans in a text message.
