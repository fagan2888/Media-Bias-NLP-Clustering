We\u2019re here to be the best health solutions company in the United States, Geraghty said. \u201cOur goal is big. It\u2019s bold. And we\u2019ve been very outspoken about it since word one.\u201d\n\nFlorida Blue, established in 1944, remains the company\u2019s main product, he said. A desire to make new investments and partner with entrepreneurial startups led to the move of $1.6 billion in capital from Florida Blue to create GuideWell, he said.\n\nAnd the company\u2019s clearly redirecting its message and branding toward GuideWell, which it quietly introduced earlier this year and describes as \u201ca family of forward-thinking companies focused on helping people and communities achieve better health.\u201d\n\nSigns, nametags and introductions of staff at the three-day Medifuture conference highlighted GuideWell and made very little mention of Florida Blue. Instead, conference participants saw GuideWell\u2019s social media team livestream interviews from a pop-up TV studio. A massive GuideWell exhibit offered tours of products it and outside partners have created for the home, office and retail clinics.\n\n\u201cInnovation at Guidewell is at the top of the list,\u201d Geraghty said. \u201cThis is what we are focused on in so many ways. And we do it through lots of partnerships.\u201d\n\nGeraghty, one of the event\u2019s keynote speakers, says GuideWell\u2019s recent growth can be attributed another of its interests: Diversified Service Options Inc. into 12 states. The company serves as an administrator for government Medicare and Medicaid contracts in Florida and 12 other states.\n\n\u201cPretty quietly, we now have a customer base of 15.5 million people, even though people think about us as Florida Blue,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s ok by us. We don\u2019t have to have the big notice around that. But we are growing dramatically.\u201d\n\nThough much of Geraghty\u2019s 20-minute speech focused on the future, he was clear that the company wants to retain its hold as Florida\u2019s largest health insurance company. But, he said, that will be done using less-traditional approaches.\n\nFor example, reaching consumers through the company\u2019s retail centers is behind the signup of an addition 339,000 Floridians in health plans offered as part of the Affordable Care Act, he said. In three years, the number of Florida Blue retail locations has grown from four to 18.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about engagement. It\u2019s about the customer,\u201d he said of the focus on brick-and- mortar stores. \u201cAnd what we have is a product that\u2019s been historically complex and impersonal. And this is a time of retail.\u201d\n\nAlong the same lines, Geraghty said the company will continue creating its own health care facilities, such as a GuideWell emergency medicine practice in Orlando, he said. It\u2019s also made a significant investment at the Lake Nona medical community near Orlando.\n\n\u201cWe have a full docket of tough issues to be addressed in health care that we\u2019re going\u2026 We\u2019ll be inviting people from around the country to be part of that as well as we go forward,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy? Because we want to be a thought leader in health and health care.\u201d\n\n--Health News Florida is part of WUSF Public Media.
