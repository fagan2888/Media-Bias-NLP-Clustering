But just who plans to rescue the system is still a big unknown.\n\nSeveral for-profit or even regional health systems could take over Daughters of Charity after for-profit chain Prime Healthcare Services declined to pursue an $843 million takeover of the system after the California attorney general added 300 requirements to the sale, among them that all six hospitals are kept open for 10 years.\n\n[Also: Daughters of Charity lays off staff]\n\nDaughters of Charity executives have said they are actvely looking for a buyer, a list that could include several of the original bidders who made a short list from 133 interested buyers.\n\nProspect Medical Holdings\n\nOne potential buyer California-based hospital operator Prospect Medical Holdings, a network of 13 acute care and behavioral hospitals and 40 clinics. Founded in 1996 as a medical group and operating hospitals since 2007, Prospect has been expanding from its West Coast base since it was acquired in 2011 by Leonard Green & Partners, a Los Angeles-based private equity firm, under the leadership of private equity veteran Samuel Lee.\n\nIn 2012, Prospect acquired the Nix Health hospital system in San Antonio, Texas, and bought another facility 70 miles away the next year. Last summer, Prospect entered into what it calls \u201ca unique and innovative partnership\u201d in Rhode Island, a joint venture where it became the majority owner of CharterCARE Health Partners\u2019 two hospitals, Roger Williams Medical Center and Our Lady of Fatima Hospital.\n\nPending regulatory approval in New Jersey, Prospect is also set to acquire the East Orange General Hospital, just west of Newark, for $84 million. Early in May, Prospect signed a tentative deal to buy the Waterbury Hospital, in Connecticut, on financial terms that were not disclosed.\n\n[Also: Daughters only has 20 days cash on hand, inks union deal]\n\nProspect Medical scored second behind Prime in the DCHS bid assessment, based on long-term viability and certainty of closing. The estimated value of Prospect\u2019s bid, including the assumption of debt, was $831 million, tied with Prime\u2019s initial bid, though about $12 million below the final one.\n\nProspect is an \u201cexperienced California hospital operator,\u201d and \u201cbacked by large investment fund capable of providing necessary resources,\u201d said Daughters of Charity in a board presentation. Prospect also promised $300 million in capital improvements over five years. (Prime\u2019s bid pledged $150 million in capital improvements, pension coverage for about 17,000 workers and retirees, and a commitment to honor union contracts.)\n\nAmong Prospects\u2019 weakness were that it \u201crequires the Church Plan to remain with DCHS,\u201d meaning the Daughters\u2019 pension plan would be \u201cfunded by a TBD payment from Prospect\u201d at the close of the deal, the board presentation said. It would also have to obtain a capital commitment.\n\nStrategic Global Management\n\nThe other runner-up bidder is Strategic Global Management, a California-based for-profit hospital operator whose bid was pegged at $851 million.\n\nStrategic Global operates seven hospitals in Riverside, San Bernardino and Orange County, and is led by the main investor Kali Chaudhuri, MD, an orthopedic surgeon. Chaudhuri, also known as \u201cDoctor C,\u201d is an American immigrant physician from India who became a healthcare entrepreneur, much like Prime founder and CEO Prem Reddy, MD, who was born in rural India, settled in LA\u2019s Inland empire, became a prolific cardiologist and then started running hospitals in the 1990s.\n\nChaudhuri, through his KPC Group and Strategic Global, has led a number of healthcare and real estate business ventures through various takeovers, including a large medical practice group in California, the hospitals and what in 2003 was the first private medical college in West Bengal, India, the KPC Medical College & Hospital.\n\n[Also: Prime backs out of Daughters deal]\n\nIn the past five years, Strategic Global has made $350 million in takeover deals. In 2010, it acquired the Hemet Valley Medical Center and Menifee Valley Medical Center, and in 2012 it purchased the Victor Valley Community Hospital \u2014 the same hospital, located in the longtime residence of Reddy, that Prime unsuccessfully tried to acquire in 2011. Prime saw that deal thwarted by a state attorney general too.\n\nDCHS has called Strategic Global an \u201cexperienced California hospital operator,\u201d having survived state regulatory review in a number of acquisitions, despite skirmishes with labor unions. It also promised $200 million in capital improvements over five years.\n\nAmong Strategic\u2019s weakness were the same two concerns about Prospect \u2014 financing the pensions plus capitalization \u2014 along with the fact that it has \u201cdemonstrated limited experience with transactions of this scale,\u201d DCHS said.\n\nBlue Wolf Capital Partners\n\nOne of the other top bidders, Blue Wolf Capital Partners, failed to impress DCHA but is much preferred by labor unions SEIU-Healthcare Workers West and United Nurses Associations of California \u2014 partly because it proposed keeping Daughters nonprofit.\n\nA 10-year-old New York-based private equity firm, Blue Wolf is led by co-founder and managing partner Adam Blumenthal, former CFO for New York City\u2019s comptroller office and chairman of the investment committee of the United Auto Worker\u2019s $55 billion retiree health benefit fund. Blue Wolf submitted a bid valued at $803 million, with the added benefits of union support, a $300 million capital improvement investment, likely regulatory approval and financing from GE Capital (although GE Capital is now up for sale).\n\nIt scored weaker largely because its ability to maintain the 501(c)(3) status was unclear, it would have \u201cminimal capital invested into operations,\u201d and leave DCHS \u201cthinly capitalized\u201d post-closing absent a deposit,\u201d executives told the DCHS board. As Daughters CEO Robert Issai has said, Blue Wolf also has \u201czero experience operating hospitals.\u201d\n\nFollow Healthcare Finance on Twitter and LinkedIn.\n\nThe extent of Blue Wolf\u2019s healthcare experience include the operation of Healthcare Laundry Systems, the largest healthcare laundry provider in North America, a controlling stake held in an independent pharmacy benefits consulting firm, and a nonprofit joint venture with a struggling NYC hospital launched last year. Blue Wolf partnered with the Mount Sinai-affiliated Brooklyn Hospital Center to set up a nonprofit joint venture to help capitalize a network of urgent care centers throughout the hospital\u2019s service area. A Blue Wolf joint venture also tried unsuccessfully to acquire Long Island College Hospital.\n\nOther privately-held healthcare companies made DCHS\u2019 short list, but decided not to pursue full bids, among them Integrity Health Care, Inc. and Paladin Healthcare Capital.\n\nThe others\n\nThen there are a number of large nonprofit health systems that could buy all or some of the Daughters of Charity hospitals and clinics. California systems like Kaiser Permanente, Dignity Health or Providence Health & Services could be suitors, as well as large faith-based networks like Catholic Health Initiatives or Trinity Health. The Santa Clara County government has also proposed the idea of buying the O'Connor and St. Louise hospitals and running them as public facilities.\n\nBut as DCHS leaders see it, the health system ideally needs be acquired as a whole, including $400 million in tax-exempt bond and other debt, plus some $300 million in estimated pension needs.\n\n\u201cThe liabilities make it difficult to buy individual facilities,\u201d said David Miller, the SEIU-UHW\u2019s assistant to the president for strategic campaigns. \u201cDCHS can\u2019t be pulled apart without triggering the bond debt collateralization and the employee pension obligations.\u201d That would require bankruptcy \u2014 exactly what Daughters leaders have long wanted to avoid.\n\nTwitter: @AnthonyBrino", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/who-will-buy-daughters-charity-breaking-down-suitors", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/OConnor-Hospital-Daughters-of-Charity-feature_5.gif", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "With Prime's deal dead, and bankruptcy on the horizon, Daughters of Charity executives have several options for possible new deals, including many of the original bidders.", "title": "Who will buy Daughters of Charity?
