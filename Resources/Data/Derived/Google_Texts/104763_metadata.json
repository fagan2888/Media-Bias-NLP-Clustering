Rand Paul \u201cThe Most Interesting Man in Politics\u201d in a cover story, but the publication might have more accurately called him \u201cThe Most Conflicted Man in Politics.\u201d\n\nIn his quest for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination, the freshman Tea Party conservative from Kentucky has been reaching out to minorities and young people to try to remake his image. Some political analysts and policy makers warn, however, that Paul may encounter stiff headwinds on the campaign trail for straddling or flip-flopping on sensitive issues \u2013 issues that include the war against ISIS, immigration reform and privacy issues.\n\nRelated: Rand Paul\u2019s Tactic for Winning Over a Nervous GOP: Invoke Reagan\n\n\u201cTrying to have it both ways is fairly common in politics, but there\u2019s a cost,\u201d said Larry J. Sabato, a prominent University of Virginia political scientist. \u201cHis likely presidential opponents in the GOP are already taking note. The opposition research reports on Rand Paul will be substantial. The TV ads write themselves: \u2018Which Rand Paul are you voting for?\u2019\u201d\n\nWHY THIS MATTERS\n\nRand Paul, a new Republican maverick with an eye on the future, doesn\u2019t hesitate to break the rules of his club. He wants the GOP to be the party for Latinos and blacks, and to champion the middle class. That accounts for some of his split personality in terms of immigration reform. But he also brings a strong following among young people\u2014a group coveted by politicos\u2014and necessary for a win in 2016.\n\nSabato added, \u201cFlip-flopping is a standard topic for negative political spots.\u201d\n\nPaul and his admirers insist he\u2019s not flip-flopping so much as taking nuanced or highly principled stands.\n\nOnce labeled an isolationist on military and foreign policy matters, Paul reluctantly bought into the Obama administration\u2019s airstrikes against ISIS jihadists in Iraq and Syria and even argued more recently that Congress should formally declare war.\n\nHe also warned that President Obama and many of his own Republican colleagues, including Sen. John McCain of Arizona, are on \u201ca fool\u2019s mission\u201d if they believe they can arm and train \u201cmoderate\u201d Free Syrian Army rebels to help combat ISIS, as part of the overall strategy.\n\nRelated: Romney Tops the List of 2016 GOP Presidential Hopefuls\n\nThe former ophthalmologist, who radiates unbridled presidential ambitions and self-confidence, has urged GOP leaders to reach out more to Hispanics and blacks to broaden the party\u2019s predominantly white political base.\n\nIn an April speech, he strongly argued against the deportation of undocumented immigrants. But after Obama\u2019s executive order last week temporarily granting nearly five million illegal immigrants protection from deportation, Paul declared he \u201cwill not sit idly by\u201d and let Obama bypass Congress and the Constitution.\n\nThen there was his startling vote last week that helped torpedoed a Senate Democratic drive to rein in the National Security Agency\u2019s surveillance of bulk telephone data \u2013 a practice Paul once denounced as \u201can all-out assault on the Constitution.\u201d\n\nRelated: Rand Paul Waffles Over Further Action Against ISIS\n\nThat legislation, the USA Freedom Act, sponsored by Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-VT), offered what many viewed as the best chance for Congress to respond to public outrage over the gross government intrusion on their lives first divulged by renegade U.S. intelligence consultant Edward Snowden.\n\nPaul said that after the vote he believed he had struck a blow for liberty because the bill would have extended several provisions of the Patriot Act, the post-9/11 measure that enhances the government\u2019s spying authority. Paul argued that by killing Leahy\u2019s bill, he could likely get a better deal next year when the deadline for renewing the majority of the Patriot Act provisions would loom.\n\nThe legislation\u2019s supporters said Paul did a major disservice to the cause. Once Republicans control the Senate in January, many will be unwilling to approve anything that reduces the NSA\u2019s powers.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know anyone who thinks -- given the changes in leadership in the next session -- that anything better from a civil liberties perspective than USA Freedom has any chance of making it to the floor,\u201d said Julian Sanchez, an intelligence policy expert at the libertarian Cato Institute. \u201cLiterally no one I can think of believes that more substantial reforms than USA Freedom is now somehow more likely.\u201d\n\nRelated: Rand Paul Reinvents Himself for the 2016 Campaign\n\nThis is not the first time Paul has left observers unclear about where he stands.\n\nHe sparked a furor during his 2010 Senate campaign by questioning the section of the 1964 Civil Rights Act that prohibits private businesses from discriminating based on race. He\u2019s since evolved into a born-again advocate for minorities\u2019 rights.\n\nHe joined with Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) in railing against the injustice of federal drug sentencing laws, favors restoring voting rights for some non-violent convicts, highlights inequality in education, and champions inner-city economic revival.\n\nAs for views on the Middle East, Paul has gone from condemning foreign aid to Israel as \u201cwelfare to a wealthy nation\u201d \u2013 a no-no as far as most conservatives are concerned \u2013 to support for that country. Now he\u2019s calling for cutting off all aid to the Palestinian National Authority.\n\nRelated: Rand Paul Leads Attack on Hillary Over Lewinsky Affair\n\nOnce the campaign heats up, experts say Paul may have to spend time at candidates\u2019 forums explaining and reconciling these and other conflicting positions.\n\n\u201cSen. Paul will have to be ready to answer charges from his opponents that he is playing it too cute on the issues,\u201d said Ron Bonjean, a political strategist and former congressional GOP spokesperson. \u201cThere are a number of issues Rand Paul will have to answer for, on stage in front of Republican primary voters.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from the Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Time recently called Sen.
