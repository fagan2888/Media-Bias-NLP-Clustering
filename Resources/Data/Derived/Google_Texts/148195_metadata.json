But supporters realize that legislative leaders don't want another fight over the issue this year.\n\n\"You could bang your head against the wall and try to get it passed this year, when you know leadership is not with you,\" he said.\n\nTaking the year to work on educational efforts will also allow more time for the governor's administration to negotiate a better deal for the stat, Becker said.\n\n\"This is a front-burner item for us. It's not gone away, we're not going dark,\" Becker said. \"But we also understand the political realities, and we're going to abide by them and make the best of it.\"\n\nThe new nonprofit is searching for an executive director and plans to hire two or three staffers to work in the field.", "article_metadata": {"description": "<p>NASHVILLE, Tenn.
