The main question, though, is whether America has finally stumbled upon its \u201clibertarian moment.\u201d And boy, do I wish the answer was yes.\n\nHere\u2019s how Robert Draper lays out the case:\n\nBut today, for perhaps the first time, the libertarian movement appears to have genuine political momentum on its side. An estimated 54 percent of Americans now favor extending marriage rights to gay couples. Decriminalizing marijuana has become a mainstream position, while the drive to reduce sentences for minor drug offenders has led to the wondrous spectacle of Rick Perry \u2014 the governor of Texas, where more inmates are executed than in any other state \u2014 telling a Washington audience: \u201cYou want to talk about real conservative governance? Shut prisons down. Save that money.\u201d The appetite for foreign intervention is at low ebb, with calls by Republicans to rein in federal profligacy now increasingly extending to the once-sacrosanct military budget.\n\nWithout getting into policy specifics, there are a few problems with this narrative.\n\nAgreeing with a libertarian on occasion doesn\u2019t make you a libertarian A libertarian \u2013 according to the dictionary, at least \u2013 is a person who \u201cupholds the principles of individual liberty especially of thought and action.\u201d And there is simply no evidence that Americans are any more inclined to support policy that furthers individual freedom or shrinks government.\n\nTake two of the most frequently cited issues that herald the libertarian renaissance: legalized pot and gay marriage. Both of them, I would argue, are only inadvertently aligned with libertarian values. These are victories in a culture war. Both issues have rapidly gained acceptance in the United States, but support for them does not equate to any newfound longing to \u201cuphold the principles of individual liberty.\u201d\n\nMany supporters of pot legalization are, for example, probably just as sympathetic to nanny-state prohibitions on products they find insalubrious or environmentally unfriendly. More seriously, many of the most passionate proponents of same-sex marriage are also the most passionate proponents of the government forcing Christian bakers and florists to participate in gay marriages and impelling religious business owners to subsidize contraception for their employees.\n\nBeating back people who stand in the way of gay marriage to make room for people who stand in the way of religious freedom and free association doesn\u2019t exactly feel like a victory on the liberty front.\n\nWho is championing libertarian ideas? Politics is always tough on libertarians as partisanship usually trumps principle. You don\u2019t have to further than polling on NSA spying programs, where parties switch positions depending on who\u2019s president, or the endless attempts by liberal pundits to justify Obama\u2019s executive abuse \u2013 during the Bush-era a portend to fascism; today, a necessity brought on by \u201cobstructionism\u201d \u2013 to understand the pitfalls libertarians face.\n\nSo where do they turn?\n\nEmily Ekins, a pollster for the Reason Foundation, had this to say in the New York Times piece:\n\nUnlike with previous generations, we\u2019re seeing a newer dimension emerge where they agree with Democrats on social issues, and on economic issues lean more to the right. It\u2019s possible that Democrats will have to shift to the right on economic issues. But the Republicans will definitely have to move to the left on social issues. They just don\u2019t have the numbers otherwise.\n\nThough I\u2019m somewhat sympathetic to this conventional wisdom, I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s true.\n\nThe case for libertarian political success always seems to hinge on the idea of pleasing the left on social issues \u2013 namely, on abortion. So why is that the most successful libertarians \u2013 and really we\u2019re talking about Republicans like Justin Amash and Rand Paul \u2013 rarely focus on the issues that allegedly define the \u201clibertarian moment.\u201d Paul has taken a moderate, incremental approach on gay marriage. He\u2019s strongly pro-life. And he\u2019s the most successful libertarian politician in America. Many social conservatives are giving Paul\u2019s libertarian views on foreign policy, the NSA, and sentencing reform a fair hearing. Which would not have happened if he had moved strongly to the left on social issues.\n\nDemocrats will never be able to accept libertarian fiscal policy. It\u2019s far more likely that conservatives will end up adopting a more laissez faire, let-the-states-decide outlook out of necessity. So maybe the more apt political question should be: how do libertarians and social conservatives coexist? That hasn\u2019t happened yet. Until it does there is no libertarian moment in American politics.\n\nThere is no \u2018libertarian moment\u2019 without libertarian economic reform It\u2019s odd that stories about the impending libertarian ascension always treat economics as an addendum to the itinerary. Especially when one considers some of the greatest thinkers of classical liberalism were (and are) economists. It\u2019s yet to be seen if grassroots conservatives will maintain their libertarian economic outlook should they ever find themselves in power. But at least some in GOP have embraced an agenda driven by actual idealism.\n\nNow, with all that said, most Americans want nothing to do with libertarian economic policy. As Kevin Williamson pointed out not long ago in Politco, the love Americans show for their expensive and inefficient programs makes a libertarian moment in the near future unlikely. No matter how often voters tell pollsters they crave more choice, limited governments and free market solutions, elections tell us that they\u2019re lying.\n\nMillennials aren\u2019t libertarians. They\u2019re socialists who want to buy legal pot Thing change, of course. I\u2019ve been hearing for a while that the next generation of voter will be skeptical of big institutions and government, and alter the political dynamic. Draper calls Millennials a \u201cwildcard,\u201d unwedded to any party. A recent Pew Research Center survey finds that half of Millennials describe themselves as political independents and about three-in-ten say they are not affiliated with religion, they prefer fewer government programs. And I don\u2019t buy it.\n\nHere\u2019s Pew:\n\nAt the same time, however, Millennials stand out for voting heavily Democratic and for liberal views on many political and social issues, ranging from a belief in an activist government to support for same-sex marriage and marijuana legalization.\n\nWhen you take a deeper dive, on almost every issue Millennials are basically liberal in big numbers.\n\nVia Hot Air:\n\n74 percent of millennials say government has a responsibility to guarantee every citizen has a place to sleep and enough to eat\u2026\n\n\n\n69 percent say it is government\u2019s responsibility to guarantee everyone access to health care and 51 percent have a favorable view of the Affordable Care Act\n\n\n\n68 percent say government should ensure everyone makes a living wage\n\n\n\n66 percent say raising taxes on the wealthy would help the economy\u2026\n\n\n\n58 percent say the government should spend more on assistance to the poor even it means higher taxes", "article_metadata": {"item-publish-date": "Fri, 08 Aug 2014 07:36:55 EDT", "og": {"site_name": "The Federalist", "description": "Has America finally stumbled upon its libertarian moment?
