He has asserted that the killing was done mistakenly in self-defense because he erroneously believed an intruder was in his home when he fired four shots through a locked bathroom door.\n\nSelf-defense is an \u201caffirmative defense,\u201d or what in South Africa is called a \u201cground of justification,\u201d which means that the defendant admits to the act of killing but not the crime of murder because he or she lacked the required intent.\n\nUsing an affirmative defense can be a risky move because the defendant must actually admit to the act. However, at the same time, it does eliminate the need for the defendant to explain incriminating evidence that usually places him or her at the scene of the crime.\n\nIn U.S. criminal cases, a defendant pleads not guilty and asserts self-defense. The prosecution would still retain the burden of proof to prove the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, but the \u201cburden of production\u201d would shift to the defendant to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that he or she had a \u201creasonable belief\u201d his or her life was in danger.\n\nFile: In this Tuesday, Feb. 19, 2013 file photo a mourner holds ... more >\n\nThis commonly requires that the defendant prove the alleged victim threatened them, creating the appearance that \u201cthe victim is being put on trial.\u201d That is not the case in the Pistorious trial since the issue is the defendant\u2019s mistaken belief an intruder invaded his home.\n\nIn South Africa, juries were abolished along with the apartheid system. As a result, Pistorious faces the challenge of convincing an experienced judge that he made an honest mistake in believing that he was firing at an intruder.\n\nBut even if Pistorious passes the subjective test of convincing the judge that his mistake was honest \u2014 that he personally believed he was firing at an intruder \u2014 and he is acquitted of murder, the Paralympic star must overcome a higher burden, the objective test of convincing the judge that his mistake was reasonable \u2014 one that an ordinary person would also make.\n\nIf Pistorious fails to prove that his mistake was reasonable, he faces a possible \u201cculpable homicide,\u201d conviction, which is the equivalent of manslaughter under U.S. law.\n\nJeffrey Scott Shapiro is a legal analyst for The Washington Times.", "article_metadata": {"description": "An acquittal in Oscar Pistorius' murder trial could still result in a homicide conviction because of the vagaries of South African law.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "An acquittal in Oscar Pistorius\u2019 murder trial could still result in a homicide conviction because of the vagaries of South African law.", "title": "SHAPIRO: Pistorius and South African law", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/apr/12/shapiro-pistorius-and-south-african-law/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/04/07/6326a1f9ab78ac0d500f6a70670024a4.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/04/07/6326a1f9ab78ac0d500f6a70670024a4.jpg", "description": "An acquittal in Oscar Pistorius' murder trial could still result in a homicide conviction because of the vagaries of South African law.", "card": "summary", "title": "SHAPIRO: Pistorius and South African law"}, "Author": "Jeffrey Scott Shapiro", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Law Crime, Oscar Pistorious"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcae7d\"", "article_summary": "Oscar Pistorious, the South African Paralympic runner accused of murdering his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp, faces a second charge of \u201cculpable homicide\u201d under South African law even if he is acquitted of murder.\nIf Pistorious fails to prove that his mistake was reasonable, he faces a possible \u201cculpable homicide,\u201d conviction, which is the equivalent of manslaughter under U.S. law.\nPistorious currently faces a possible mandatory life sentence for premeditated, deliberate murder \u2014 up to 25 years unless there are extraordinary circumstances \u2014 for killing Steenkamp.\nAs a result, Pistorious faces the challenge of convincing an experienced judge that he made an honest mistake in believing that he was firing at an intruder.\nUsing an affirmative defense can be a risky move because the defendant must actually admit to the act."}
