Customers who have these so-called \u201cgrandfathered plans\u201d can keep them for however long the insurance company continues to offer it.\n\nFor customers who don\u2019t have \u201cgrandfathered plans,\u201d things are a little different. Their insurance providers must comply with Obamacare\u2019s more robust benefit requirements. Some companies have been canceling millions of individual policies either in an effort to meet those new requirements, or because they want to change the plans in a way that would make them illegal under the health law. Most customers who shop for new individual policies under Obamacare will be eligible for tax subsidies to help them afford their coverage.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s Anthem Blue Cross may have convinced their customers that they fall into the second category \u2014 even though they\u2019re actually in the first.\n\n\u201cBlue Cross successfully enticed tens of thousands of its individual policyholders to switch out of their grandfathered health plans and forever lose their protected grandfathered status,\u201d states the lawsuit. \u201cBlue Cross concealed information about the consequences of switching plans and intentionally misled its policyholders to encourage the replacement of grandfathered policies.\u201d\n\nThe plaintiffs, Paul Simon, 39, and Catherine Corker, 63, of California say that they are among the customers that Anthem Blue Cross pressured to drop their grandfathered policies in 2011 without giving them all the facts about new Obamacare requirements that could raise the price of their plans in an effort to cut its own costs. Simon and Corker would have preferred to remain on the grandfathered plans permitted by the law, and are now asking the courts to block Anthem from canceling any more policies unless the company allows consumers to switch back into their grandfathered plans.\n\n\u201cThis is about an insurance company manipulating the situation and concealing the facts,\u201d said William Shernoff, an attorney for both the plaintiffs, in an interview with the Los Angeles Times. \u201cWe are asking the court to give our clients and everybody else in the same situation the option of going back to their grandfathered policies.\u201d\n\nCalifornia\u2019s Anthem Blue Cross has regularly come under fire for shoddy business practices. Last year, the company requested a double-digit rate hike on customers\u2019 premiums despite the fact that employers and other health insurers said that only modest adjustments were necessary in order to keep up with health care inflation.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Two angry consumers are suing one of the country's largest insurers for allegedly tricking them into dropping their insurance policies.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Two angry consumers are suing one of the country's largest insurers for allegedly tricking them into dropping their insurance policies.", "title": "Major Insurance Company Faces Lawsuit For Allegedly Tricking Customers Into Canceling Their Policies", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2013/11/07/2906861/major-insurance-company-lawsuit/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/la-fi-employer-health-costs-20120912-0011-e1370379540503.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Two angry consumers are suing one of the country's largest insurers for allegedly tricking them into dropping their insurance policies.", "creator": "@the_sy_guy", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/la-fi-employer-health-costs-20120912-0011-e1370379540503-321x214.jpg", "title": "Major Insurance Company Faces Lawsuit For Allegedly Tricking Customers Into Canceling Their Policies", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/la-fi-employer-health-costs-20120912-0011-e1370379540503.jpeg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/la-fi-employer-health-costs-20120912-0011-e1370379540503.jpeg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2013-11-07T11:08:27+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Customers who have these so-called \u201cgrandfathered plans\u201d can keep them for however long the insurance company continues to offer it.\nHealth Major Insurance Company Faces Lawsuit For Allegedly Tricking Customers Into Canceling Their Policies CREDIT: AP ImagesA major California insurance company is being sued by two consumers alleging that they were tricked into dropping their health coverage when they could have remained on their preferred plans under Obamacare, the Los Angeles Times reports.\nCalifornia\u2019s Anthem Blue Cross may have convinced their customers that they fall into the second category \u2014 even though they\u2019re actually in the first.\n\u201cThis is about an insurance company manipulating the situation and concealing the facts,\u201d said William Shernoff, an attorney for both the plaintiffs, in an interview with the Los Angeles Times.\n\u201cBlue Cross successfully enticed tens of thousands of its individual policyholders to switch out of their grandfathered health plans and forever lose their protected grandfathered status,\u201d states the lawsuit."}
