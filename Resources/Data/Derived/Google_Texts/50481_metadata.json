Those are only half measures,\u201d he told Crowley. \u201cIf we are really serious about stopping Obamacare, we\u2019ll destroy the entire planet.\u201d\n\nExplaining his proposal to a visibly alarmed Crowley, Senator Cruz said, \u201cObamacare is like a parasite that needs a host to feed on. If you want to kill the parasite you kill the host, and in this case that means killing this planet. As long as there\u2019s a planet Earth, the nightmare of Obamacare could always come screaming back to life.\u201d\n\nWhile he was not specific about how he would go about destroying the planet, Cruz said, \u201cThis is something that my colleagues and I have been working on for some time.\u201d\n\nThe Texas senator refused to speculate on whether there were enough votes in Congress to support his proposal of obliterating Earth, but he ended his interview on a personal note: \u201cCandy, I don\u2019t want my children and my children\u2019s children to live in a world with Obamacare. And the best way to guarantee that is by destroying the world.\u201d\n\nGet the Borowitz Report delivered to your inbox.\n\nPhotograph by Alex Wong/Getty", "article_metadata": {"cache-version": 20160520163214, "description": "WASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)\u2014Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas) raised the ante in the battle over the Affordable Care Act on Sunday, telling CNN\u2019s Candy \u2026", "account-url": "https://account.newyorker.com", "wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "og": {"site_name": "The New Yorker", "description": "WASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)\u2014Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas) raised the ante in the battle over the Affordable Care Act on Sunday, telling CNN\u2019s Candy \u2026", "title": "Ted Cruz: Destroying Entire Planet Best Way to Stop Obamacare - The New Yorker", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 580, "identifier": "http://www.newyorker.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/ted-cruz-senate-580.jpg", "height": 376}, "updated_time": "2014-07-16T16:53:04-04:00", "url": "http://www.newyorker.com/humor/borowitz-report/ted-cruz-destroying-entire-planet-best-way-to-stop-obamacare", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "WASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)\u2014Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas) raised the ante in the battle over the Affordable Care Act on Sunday, telling CNN\u2019s Candy \u2026", "creator": "@BorowitzReport", "image": "http://www.newyorker.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/ted-cruz-senate-580.jpg", "title": "Ted Cruz: Destroying Entire Planet Best Way to Stop Obamacare - The New Yorker", "site": "@newyorker", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The New Yorker", "robots": "noodp", "parsely-metadata": "{\"id\":\"1693441\",\"title_alt\":\"Ted Cruz: Destroying Entire Planet Best Way to Stop Obamacare\",\"featured_image_url\":\"http:\\/\\/www.newyorker.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2013\\/10\\/ted-cruz-senate-580-580-375.jpg\"}", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "environment": "prod", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1081530898", "fb": {"admins": 757909316}, "article": {"section": "Borowitz Report", "tag": "Satire", "published_time": "2013-10-07T08:21:49-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-16T16:53:04-04:00"}, "google-site-verification": "_jvLA9pRQom0-f6587wRKrNwfRtqyKzjfYWvwcZ5fxc", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "id": 1693441, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0", "news_keywords": "Satire"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd643\"", "article_summary": "And the best way to guarantee that is by destroying the world.\u201dGet the Borowitz Report delivered to your inbox.\n\u201cIf we are really serious about stopping Obamacare, we\u2019ll destroy the entire planet.\u201dExplaining his proposal to a visibly alarmed Crowley, Senator Cruz said, \u201cObamacare is like a parasite that needs a host to feed on.\nIf you want to kill the parasite you kill the host, and in this case that means killing this planet.\nWASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)\u2014Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas) raised the ante in the battle over the Affordable Care Act on Sunday, telling CNN\u2019s Candy Crowley that \u201cdestroying the entire planet is really the best and only way to stop Obamacare.\u201d\u201cLook, I\u2019m in favor of shutting down the government and not raising the debt ceiling, but let\u2019s not kid ourselves.\nThose are only half measures,\u201d he told Crowley."}
