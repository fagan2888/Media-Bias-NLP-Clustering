They already are wearing LFA buttons and dressing in black on Fridays to show support for the union effort.\n\nadvertisement | advertise on newsday\n\n\"Our teachers have dedicated their lives to teach at these [Diocese of] Rockville Centre schools, knowing their salaries would never equal those of the public sector,\" Quattrocchi said. \"However, the dignity of every teacher is at stake. How much more do the teachers have to sacrifice? Our teachers have families to support and bills to pay too.\"\n\nDolan said the diocese is trying to be fair to the teachers, but that it does not have the resources of public school districts.\n\n\"We're in a different environment than the public schools,\" he said. \"We don't have a tax base we can call upon to fund needed increases in salaries or capital expenses.\"\n\nThe high schools are funded primarily through tuition, which generally is about $9,500 a year per student.\n\nDiocesan high school teachers earn an average starting salary of $38,000 a year and top out at about $75,000, Quattrocchi said.\n\nThat compares with a starting salary of $48,693 and a top salary of $123,518 in Islip, which Superintendent Susan A. Schnebel described as a midlevel district. Schnebel is president of the Suffolk County School Superintendents Association.\n\nThe Catholic school teachers are asking for a 6 percent increase per year for three years. The diocese countered with a proposed increase of 1.5 percent for the first two years and 2 percent the third year, according to Quattrocchi.\n\nWhile the 6 percent might seem high, Quattrocchi said, the teachers have had many \"givebacks\" in prior contracts.\n\nadvertisement | advertise on newsday\n\nFor instance, unlike in public schools, they no longer have annual \"step increases\" in which a teacher's salary automatically goes up with each year of experience. Pension contributions by the diocese have dropped from 12 percent to 4 percent, he said, while the health care costs that teachers pay have increased.\n\nDolan said he could not comment on specifics of the negotiations.\n\nBishop William Murphy, he said, \"has to balance what is equitable and fair with what is reasonable and not overly burdensome upon the supporters of the schools.\"", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.date": "Sat, 14 Nov 2015 20:36:31 -0500", "sailthru.author": "BART JONES", "description": "The union leader for 216 teachers at three Catholic high schools in the Diocese of Rockville Centre says negotiations with the diocese on a new", "application-name": "Newsday", "pinterest": "http://cdn.newsday.com/polopoly_fs/1.7439102.1438614078!/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/display_600/image.JPG", "og": {"site_name": "Newsday", "description": "The union leader for 216 teachers at three Catholic high schools in the Diocese of Rockville Centre says negotiations with the diocese on a new", "title": "Union: Catholic school negotiations at impasse", "url": "http://www.newsday.com/long-island/union-leader-for-st-john-the-baptist-holy-trinity-bishop-mcgann-mercy-negotiations-at-impasse-1.11123238", "image": "http://cdn.newsday.com/polopoly_fs/1.7439102.1438614078!/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/display_600/image.JPG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The union leader for 216 teachers at three Catholic high schools in the Diocese of Rockville Centre says negotiations with the diocese on a new", "title": "Union: Catholic school negotiations at impasse", "app": {"id": {"ipad": 358571317, "iphone": 358571317, "googleplay": "com.pagesuite.newsday"}}, "site": "@Newsday", "image": "http://cdn.newsday.com/polopoly_fs/1.7439102.1438614078!/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/display_600/image.JPG", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#1B3664", "msvalidate.01": "AC41EB10D1EC6B5358F0ECA0E861CCAA", "sailthru.title": "Union: Catholic school negotiations at impasse", "p": {"domain_verify": "b22f651177478af415d53d6eb00b8167"}, "fb": {"pages": 19175874448, "app_id": 147686468041}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/newsday/nd-win8-icon.png", "keywords": "local long island hicksville riverhead rockville centre west islip article newsday hold", "google-site-verification": "o-9vlp-b_yaYN8wXq9FvnnetTEfKCHqJghR7f_DOTf4", "sailthru.tags": "local long island hicksville riverhead rockville centre west islip article newsday hold", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "The high schools are funded primarily through tuition, which generally is about $9,500 a year per student.\nThe Catholic school teachers are asking for a 6 percent increase per year for three years.\nDiocesan high school teachers earn an average starting salary of $38,000 a year and top out at about $75,000, Quattrocchi said.\nWhile the 6 percent might seem high, Quattrocchi said, the teachers have had many \"givebacks\" in prior contracts.\n\"We're in a different environment than the public schools,\" he said."}
