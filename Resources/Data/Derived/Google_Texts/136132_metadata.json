Myers sell the expansive Hunterdon County home where he plans to retire.\n\nMembers of the group, Faithful America, contend Myers should follow the example of Atlanta\u2019s archbishop, Wilton Gregory, who recently apologized to parishioners for using church funds to build a 6,100-square-foot, $2.2 million residence in an exclusive neighborhood.\n\nGregory announced earlier this week he would sell the home, with the proceeds going toward \"the needs of the Catholic community.\"\n\nIn Newark, the parishioners will seek to hand the petition to Myers after the noon Mass at the Cathedral Basilica of the Sacred Heart on Ridge Street. Myers is scheduled to say the Mass, his spokesman, Jim Goodness, confirmed Friday.\n\nRELATED DOCUMENTS \u2022 Read Faithful America's letter to its members\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Pope Francis has called for a church that is of the poor and for the poor, and even other bishops have responded to that,\" said Michael Sherrard, Faithful America\u2019s executive director. \"Archbishop Myers seems not to have gotten the memo.\"\n\nFaithful America, headquartered in Washington D.C., has a nationwide membership of 280,000, Sherrard said. The group\u2019s mission is to \"advance Christianity as a cause for common good,\" he said.\n\nMyers has come under sharp criticism since The Star-Ledger disclosed in February he was building a 3,000-square-foot addition on the 4,500-square-foot home he has used as a weekend retreat.\n\nThe original structure, situated on 8.2 acres in Franklin Township, has five bedrooms, three bathrooms, a three-car garage and an elevator. A large outdoor pool lies out back. The archdiocese bought the home for $700,000 in 2002, a year after Myers arrived in Newark. The property is now valued at nearly $800,000 records show.\n\nThe three-story addition, already well underway, will cost a minimum of $500,000, not including design fees and furnishings, according to documents and blueprints in the local planning office.\n\nThe new wing will contain an office with an attached library, an additional bedroom with a sitting area, an indoor exercise pool, a Whirlpool tub, three fireplaces and a second elevator. The entire third floor is identified on blueprints as a gallery.\n\nGoodness, the spokesman, said the construction is being funded through the sale of other properties and through a small number of private donations.\n\nThe recent criticism over the addition has not changed the archbishop\u2019s plan to move into the residence full time when he retires in 2016, Goodness said.\n\nHe added that the archdiocese\u2019s finance council, a lay panel that assists the archbishop on financial issues, discussed the home with Myers at a regular meeting recently and found no fault with the expansion.\n\n\"The end result was, \u2018This makes sense. It\u2019s appropriate,\u2019\" Goodness said. \"They were very supportive of it.\"\n\nRELATED COVERAGE\n\n\u2022 Newark Archbishop's pricey retirement home spurs backlash as parishioners withhold donations\n\n\u2022 Newark archbishop's future retirement home undergoing a $500K addition\n\n\u2022 Newark Archdiocese fails to pay state taxes in for-profit headstone, mausoleum business", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "'@bergen-county','@river','essex-county','hudson-county','newark','religion','union-county'", "title": "Angry about archbishop's pricey retirement home, parishioners to deliver 17,000 signatures Sunday", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Angry about archbishop\\u0027s pricey retirement home, parishioners to deliver 17,000 signatures Sunday\", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2014/04/angry_about_archbishops_pricey_retirement_home_parishioners_to_deliver_17000_signatures_sunday.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/ledgerupdates_impact/photo/2014/02/14282202-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"12641813\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-04-12T12:02:43Z\", \"author\": \"Mark Mueller | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com\", \"tags\": [\"@bergen-county\",\"@river\",\"essex-county\",\"hudson-county\",\"newark\",\"religion\",\"union-county\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.nj.com/ledgerupdates_impact/photo/2014/02/14282202-thumb_square_large.jpg", "creator": "@MarkJMueller", "site": "@njdotcom", "card": "summary", "description": "The petition urges Archbishop Myers to sell his future retirement home in Hunterdon County"}, "article_date_updated": "Saturday, April 12, 2014,  8:02 AM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.nj.com/ledgerupdates_impact/photo/2014/02/img-2384jpg-ead1a1d19d16fa02.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"mjmuelle\", \"author_nickname\": \"Mark Mueller | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com\", \"author_id\": \"2112\", \"source_blog_name\": \"New Jersey Real-Time News\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "NJ.com", "description": "The petition urges Archbishop Myers to sell his future retirement home in Hunterdon County", "title": "Angry about archbishop's pricey retirement home, parishioners to deliver 17,000 signatures Sunday", "url": "http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2014/04/angry_about_archbishops_pricey_retirement_home_parishioners_to_deliver_17000_signatures_sunday.html", "image": "http://media.nj.com/design/alpha/img/logo_njo.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NJ.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Saturday, April 12, 2014,  8:00 AM", "article_author": "Mark Mueller | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com", "Description": "The petition urges Archbishop Myers to sell his future retirement home in Hunterdon County"}, "article_summary": "RELATED COVERAGE\u2022 Newark Archbishop's pricey retirement home spurs backlash as parishioners withhold donations\u2022 Newark archbishop's future retirement home undergoing a $500K addition\u2022 Newark Archdiocese fails to pay state taxes in for-profit headstone, mausoleum business\n\"Archbishop Myers seems not to have gotten the memo.\"\nIn Newark, the parishioners will seek to hand the petition to Myers after the noon Mass at the Cathedral Basilica of the Sacred Heart on Ridge Street.\nGoodness, the spokesman, said the construction is being funded through the sale of other properties and through a small number of private donations.\nGregory announced earlier this week he would sell the home, with the proceeds going toward \"the needs of the Catholic community.\""}
