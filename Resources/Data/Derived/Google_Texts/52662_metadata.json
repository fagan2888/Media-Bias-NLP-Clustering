Bush made passage of No Child Left Behind one of his first priorities. Now, his brother Jeb Bush is speaking out in favor of reauthorizing the law as he plots his own run for the White House.\n\n\u201cThe goal of conservatives should be to limit federal intervention in education by restoring state and local control of education,\u201d says @lindseymburke\n\nWriting for The Washington Post, the former Florida governor blamed President Obama for failing to improve the legislation. Instead, Bush said the current administration has issued \u201ca patchwork of waivers and side deals, given out by fiat and without consistency.\u201d\n\nClaiming that \u201cmost states had no accountability system\u201d prior to No Child Left Behind, Bush said the 2002 law created \u201ca common yardstick.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow, all states participate in the National Assessment of Educational Progress, a series of high-quality tests known as the Nation\u2019s Report Card,\u201d Bush wrote. \u201cThe results give us an apples-to-apples comparison among states. Annual testing and reporting also force states to confront their failures, especially the substandard education often offered to disadvantaged children.\u201d\n\nBush acknowledged \u201cNCLB is far from perfect,\u201d but said its flaws \u201ccan be fixed in the reauthorization process.\u201d He said changes should put \u201clocal districts in control of making vital decisions about standards, curriculum and academic content.\u201d\n\nReauthorization Debate in Congress\n\nLast month, as the House prepared to vote on the law\u2019s reauthorization, GOP leaders quietly pulled the bill after a backlash from conservative lawmakers who said the proposal didn\u2019t go far enough in scaling back the federal government\u2019s role in education. Senators are reportedly close to reaching a bipartisan deal on their own version of the bill.\n\nLindsey Burke, the Will Skillman fellow in education policy at The Heritage Foundation, said reauthorizing No Child Left Behind without significant changes would be settling for the status quo.\n\n\u201cIf we really want states to \u2018take the lead on education,\u2019 as Gov. Bush proposed in his op-ed,\u201d Burke told The Daily Signal, \u201cthe best option on the table for doing so isn\u2019t a reauthorization of a 620-page No Child Left Behind rewrite.\u201d\n\nBurke has championed the Academic Partnerships Lead Us to Success (A-PLUS) legislation that would let states completely opt out of the programs and mandates authorized under education law. They could then direct funding to their education priorities as opposed to mandates from Washington.\n\n\u201cThe goal of conservatives should be to limit federal intervention in education by restoring state and local control of education, not reauthorizing the nation\u2019s largest K-12 education law in a way that codifies four decades of ineffective policy,\u201d she said.\n\nBurke added that Florida\u2019s recent improvements to its own educational system are proof of what the states can accomplish when they are free from excessive intrusion from the federal government.\n\n\u201cGov. Bush is correct in saying the federal government \u2018should be subservient to the role of states,\u2019\u201d Burke said. \u201cIn order to get there, however, we need to stop the federal education spending spree, and begin eliminating the dozens upon dozens of grant programs that have accumulated at the U.S. Department of Education over the decades.\u201d\n\nAs governor of Florida from 1999 to 2007, Bush spearheaded several education reforms in the Sunshine State, leading it to make some of the greatest education gains in the country, Burke said.\n\n\u201cGov. Bush is in a good position to recognize that the best path forward is to allow states to completely free themselves from large scale federal directives like No Child Left Behind,\u201d she said.\n\nConflict Over Common Core\n\nIn the op-ed, Bush also addressed the hot-button issue of Common Core education standards, which many conservatives oppose.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen more than 40 states voluntarily work together to create the Common Core standards for language arts and math,\u201d Bush wrote. \u201cI support such rigorous, state-driven academic standards. Some states would rather set their own standards, and that\u2019s appropriate, provided they are high standards. But no matter what, no state should be forced to adopt standards mandated by the federal government.\u201d\n\n\u201cCommon Core grows federal intervention in education by putting federal fingerprints on the content taught in local schools across the country,\u201d says @BrittanyLCorona\n\nBrittany Corona, a research assistant in domestic policy studies at The Heritage Foundation, said the creators and early supporters of Common Core\u2014Achieve Inc., National Governors Association, and Chief Council for State School Officers\u2014had a different idea in mind. They called for federal incentives to be attached to the adoption of the standards in their 2008 report, \u201cBenchmarking for Success.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom the beginning,\u201d Corona said, \u201cthe effort has been incentivized by federal funding. Common Core can largely be described as an extension of the same failed logic of No Child Left Behind: all that\u2019s missing in education is more centralization.\u201d\n\nCommon Core supporters maintain there\u2019s nothing nefarious about the standards. Michael Brickman, national policy director at the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, recently told The Daily Signal that Common Core is just a \u201cset of goals and expectations\u201d to standardize what students across the nation know when they graduate from high school.\n\n\u201cIn many cases, it\u2019s the exact things that conservatives have been calling for for a long time,\u201d said Brickman, \u201cmainly, a back-to-basics approach of focus on reading, writing and arithmetic.\u201d\n\nBrickman said everyone should know \u201cwhat\u2019s actually in the standards.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet me be clear, I\u2019ve seen some of the posts on Facebook about confusing math, I\u2019ve seen the posts about what they don\u2019t like about indoctrinating curriculum in schools. \u2026 They\u2019re right. The parents who are out there concerned about those things are absolutely right. But they need to know that these things have nothing to do with Common Core.\u201d\n\nBrickman said that Common Core is often blamed for decisions made at the local level. He said that parents should remain engaged with their local school districts.\n\nHeritage\u2019s Corona, however, maintains that Common Core is the wrong approach to education reform.\n\n\u201cCommon Core grows federal intervention in education by putting federal fingerprints on the content taught in local schools across the country,\u201d she told The Daily Signal. \u201cStates should also \u2018take the lead\u2019 in their own standards writing and test creation, ensuring state autonomy over decisions about what is taught.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jeb Bush is speaking out in favor of reauthorizing No Child Left Behind as a way to give states more freedom while also maintaining accountability.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Jeb Bush is speaking out in favor of reauthorizing No Child Left Behind as a way to give states more freedom while also maintaining accountability.", "title": "What Jeb Bush Thinks About No Child Left Behind and Common Core", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150510_JebBush.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-03-10T23:09:52+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1Bko9ov"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Jeb Bush is speaking out in favor of reauthorizing No Child Left Behind as a way to give states more freedom while also maintaining accountability.", "title": "Conservatives Critique Jeb Bush's Stance on No Child Left Behind, Common Core", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150510_JebBush.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Education", "tag": "common core,k-12", "published_time": "2015-03-11T03:01:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-10T23:09:52+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Jeb Bush, NCLB, No Child Left Behind, Elementary and Secondary Education Act, Common Core, 2016, GOP presidential candidates"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc2d6\"", "article_summary": "Conflict Over Common CoreIn the op-ed, Bush also addressed the hot-button issue of Common Core education standards, which many conservatives oppose.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen more than 40 states voluntarily work together to create the Common Core standards for language arts and math,\u201d Bush wrote.\nHeritage\u2019s Corona, however, maintains that Common Core is the wrong approach to education reform.\n\u201cCommon Core grows federal intervention in education by putting federal fingerprints on the content taught in local schools across the country,\u201d she told The Daily Signal.\nBut they need to know that these things have nothing to do with Common Core.\u201dBrickman said that Common Core is often blamed for decisions made at the local level."}
