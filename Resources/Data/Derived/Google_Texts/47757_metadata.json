There is no third lane planned for the westbound approach.\n\nBut before crews can start the blasting that will widen the existing westbound bore, traffic must be rerouted from the west into the eastbound bore. Crews will put down temporary pavement in the center median on both sides of the tunnel to transition westbound traffic into and out of the eastbound lanes, CDOT says.\n\nThis center median work will take about a month to complete and requires closing the far left lane of eastbound I-70 during off-peak travel hours.\n\n\u201cWith this year\u2019s record snowfall in the mountains, we realize how important it is to keep traffic moving during the spring-break ski season, so we will only close lanes during off-peak travel times and we will monitor traffic flow so we can make adjustments as needed,\u201d said CDOT project manager Benjamin Acimovic.\n\nOther prep work in the westbound tunnel bore requires putting I-70 traffic in head-to-head configuration through the eastbound tunnel for overnight work. This will be done several nights through March and will involve maintaining two eastbound lanes and one westbound lane.\n\nMonte Whaley: 720-929-0907, mwhaley@denverpost.com or twitter.com/montewhaley", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Traffic rerouting starts for westbound Twin Tunnels approach", "title": "Traffic rerouting starts for westbound Twin Tunnels approach", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/03/08/traffic-rerouting-starts-for-westbound-twin-tunnels-approach/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140308__EB-tunnel-i-70p1.jpg", "height": 415}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140308__EB-tunnel-i-70p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-03-08T14:56:24+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T23:13:09+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbb59\"", "article_summary": "Traffic rerouting starts Monday on westbound Interstate 70 as the Colorado Department of Transportation begins widening the westbound bore of the Twin Tunnels in Idaho Springs.\nOther prep work in the westbound tunnel bore requires putting I-70 traffic in head-to-head configuration through the eastbound tunnel for overnight work.\nBut before crews can start the blasting that will widen the existing westbound bore, traffic must be rerouted from the west into the eastbound bore.\nThis will be done several nights through March and will involve maintaining two eastbound lanes and one westbound lane.\nLast year, crews expanded the eastbound approach to the Twin Tunnels to three lanes."}
