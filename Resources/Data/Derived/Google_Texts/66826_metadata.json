Rozsa said she did.\n\n\u201cYou had her escorted out of your office?\u201d Seay asked.\n\n\u201cI did,\u201d Rozsa said, adding that the woman came without documentation showing she had authority to look around the office.\n\nBoth Gamino and Seay made multiple objections throughout the hearing.\n\nSeay showed a photograph of Rozsa sitting in a wheelchair in her office with blankets over her, her prescription pad in her lap.\n\nSeay said Rozsa lived in her office, sleeping on an air mattress.\n\nRozsa said that wasn\u2019t true and that her home was being remodeled, has mold and was burglarized and trashed.\n\n\u201cIt just seems, to some extent, unbelievable,\u201d said Dr. J. Andy Sullivan, a longtime board member. \u201cYou were living in your office in a wheelchair.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Oklahoma Board of Medical Licensure and Supervision voted unanimously Thursday to keep an emergency suspension in place on the medical license of Dr. Tamerlane Rozsa, a Tulsa-based family medicine physician.", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 NewsOK.com.
