And a dead body.\n\nIf breast is best, as we\u2019re so often told by our Aunt Phyllis and random strangers, then you\u2019d think companies would do everything they could to support the efforts of working mothers who want to breast-feed for as long as possible, right?\n\nHa.\n\nSince 2010, the Affordable Care Act has required that employers provide women with a private space with a locking door to pump; a bathroom does not count.\n\nBut a brilliant piece with an accompanying photo gallery by Isolde Raftery, an online editor at Seattle public radio station KUOW, indicates that many employers are falling short of this requirement, using former shower stalls, crowded supply closets, and even folding screens (in the middle of a larger room) for working mothers who wish to pump.\n\nWhile Virginia Woolf wrote of the need for women to have money and a room of their own, many modern working mothers who choose to breast-feed their babies would settle for money (after the cost of child-care is deducted, obviously) and a clean room of their own in which to pump breast milk.\n\nMany companies are to be commended for the spaces they provide: Some photos in the slideshow depict dimly lit, private rooms with comfortable glider chairs and hospital-grade pump stations.\n\nOther companies provide spaces that are shameful.\n\nA brief word of explanation for the uninitiated (WARNING: the following passage will discuss bodily functions): To breast-feed successfully, mothers need to pump every few hours or else their milk supply will decrease or dry up entirely (this can happen within a few days). To get a good supply of milk, you need to be relaxed \u2014 stress and breast-feeding do not go well together.

Many Americans would prefer that women stayed home to raise their children. But if those women \u201cinsist\u201d on working, whether out of pure financial need or because they love their jobs, then they should feel very bad about it.\n\nRetreat to your dark corner and produce that liquid gold, woman!\n\nWorking women need to start making more noise about the need for acceptable lactation rooms at work.
