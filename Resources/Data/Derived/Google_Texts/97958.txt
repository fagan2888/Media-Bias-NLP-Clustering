Just past the mannequins in the phony waiting room at the Center for Nursing Excellence, there's a real, high tech classroom, with lifelike patient mannequins that help students at the Henry Predolin School of Nursing at Edgewood College learn the tricks of the trade.

Edgewood College School of Nursing Prof. Barb Gallogly says using the simulation mannequins, "We can mimic just about everything that we do in a clinical or hospital setting, which makes it very real to the students."

The $75,000 mannequins have laptops embedded in their chests to make them do things people do--like blink, breathe, cough, lose blood pressure, or have low pulse rates. Students can administer drugs into the "arms" of the mannequins.

A professor watches student nurses' actions with the mannequins and with actors pretending to be relatives. The professor provides feedback at a debriefing on what went well and what needs improvement.
