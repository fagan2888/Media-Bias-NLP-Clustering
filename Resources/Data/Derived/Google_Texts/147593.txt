The number of Americans failing to pay back their student loans is growing, even as overall delinquencies are in decline, according to a new report.

New data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York released Thursday found that 11.5 percent of student loan borrowers were delinquent on their debt in the second quarter of the year, up from 11.1 percent in the first quarter.

That 0.4 percent increase in delinquencies was twice as much as any other form of consumer credit, and comes as student loan debt has emerged as the largest form of non-housing consumer debt.

Delinquencies were defined as payments past due by more than 90 days, and climbed as the overall amount of student loan debt held steady at $1.19 trillion.

Student loans overtook auto loans and credit card debt as the nation’s largest pile of non-mortgage consumer debt in 2012.

The rapid growth of debt facing college graduates has emerged as a major political issue. Presidential candidates have discussed the matter on the campaign trail, and lawmakers in Washington have put forward proposals aimed at providing relief from that sector.

But the latest data show that even with an economy on the mend, more and more borrowers are finding the debt too much to handle.

While more and more borrowers aren’t paying back student loans, the New York Fed found that just 95,000 Americans added a foreclosure to their credit reports, the lowest ever level in the 16-year survey.

Climbing delinquencies in student loan debt came even as overall delinquencies fell in the second quarter to 5.6 percent, down slightly from 5.7 percent in the first quarter of the year.
