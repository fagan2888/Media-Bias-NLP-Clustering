LAKELAND, Fla. - A man was hospitalized in critical condition Monday night after an officer-involved shooting in Florida.

Sgt. Gary Gross told news outlets 46-year-old Paul Dunn of the Lakeland Police Department shot a man who was armed with a handgun.



Gross said officers had received a call from a woman seeking assistance in getting personal items out of a house. She said she wanted to avoid and altercation with a male.



When officers arrived, they knocked on the door to make contact with the male. One officer could see through a window that the man appeared to have a gun. Officers commanded him to drop the weapon. When he came out, he was still armed. Dunn then shot the man, who was later taken to a hospital where he was listed in critical condition.



Dunn, who had been with the agency 2Â½ years, will be placed on administrative leave pending an investigation.
