For a minute or so, they went over bits of on-ice strategy.\n\nTourigny is French-Canadian. French is his first language. Hejda is Czech. During this session, they spoke English. It was their common ground.\n\nFourteen of the 25 Avs are English-speaking-first Americans or Canadians. Most have minimal or no knowledge of French \u2014 or any language other than their own.\n\nColorado\u2019s seven French-Canadian players all are conversant in English. Team captain Gabe Landeskog, a native Swede, is so proficient in English he could pass for being raised in Kansas. Hejda, 35, picked up English after arriving in North America at age 28. Russian goalie Semyon Varlamov, at times uneasy communicating in English, is getting better at it as time passes. And the Avalanche added another language \u2014 Finnish \u2014 when goalie Sami Aittokallio, who speaks English well, was recalled Friday from the Lake Erie Monsters.\n\nFor reasons of practicality, English is the team language in discussing everything from strategy to itineraries. Yes, that\u2019s the case even though coach Patrick Roy and several members of his staff are French-Canadian.\n\n\u201cOf course, sometimes I\u2019m going to talk French, if it\u2019s a one-on-one,\u201d Roy said. \u201cAs much as possible, when I talk to the team, it\u2019s always in English. \u2026 English is the one most of the team is comfortable in.\u201d\n\nRoy stepped up his study of English after he was traded from Montreal to Colorado in December 1995.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still not that good,\u201d Roy said.\n\nHe noted that after each of his post- practice news conferences, Avs official Jean Martineau \u201cis giving me a lesson. I guess I\u2019m still a student.\u201d He recalled taking English in school when he was 13 in Quebec City in a class that included Martineau\u2019s future wife, Brigitte. Roy said he \u201ccheated \u2026 and I should not have done that. I might have been better today.\u201d\n\nHe said Brigitte gave him foot signals, signifying each multiple-choice answer.\n\n\u201cI was missing three or four just to make sure I didn\u2019t have the same score she had,\u201d he said. \u201cI was happy with 70 percent.\u201d\n\nIn the past, the Avs have had players of many other nationalities and languages.\n\nLandeskog, 21, made sure it was clear he was joking, but he said that sometimes he wished players didn\u2019t speak French with each other in the dressing room.\n\n\u201cAll of us English-speaking guys try to let them know to speak English, so we can all understand,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they\u2019re all good in English and speak it very well. The language is absolutely English.\u201d\n\nLandeskog studied English intensively in school, beginning in the third grade, and also came over to Canada at age 16 to play major junior hockey.\n\n\u201cAlready at that point I was fairly determined to learn the language, and my goal was to play in the NHL,\u201d he said. \u201cI knew if I could speak the language fairly well, it would make it so much easier for me.\u201d\n\nVarlamov came to the U.S. in 2008 at age 20.\n\n\u201cI definitely think English is the toughest language in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cI was pretty lazy on English my first three years because I had five Russian players on my team at Washington, and I would always speak Russian when I was hanging out with the Russian guys.\n\n\u201cWhen I came to Denver, I started picking up more words, and I am more comfortable in English now, for sure.\u201d\n\nVarlamov doesn\u2019t have any Russian teammates here, but Hejda played three seasons in Russia.\n\n\u201cLearning English was hard for me, even more so because I spent those years in Russia and I speak Russian, also,\u201d Hejda said. \u201cI had just basic English, and at first over here when someone asked me a question, my first response in my head was in the Russian language and then I would tell myself I must use English. It was a tough few years, but I learned it the same as the Russian language. I learned it in the locker room. This is the first year I do not have any Czechs with me.\u201d\n\nGoalie Jean-Sebastien Giguere, from Montreal, didn\u2019t begin learning English in earnest until he joined major junior\u2019s Halifax Mooseheads at age 17.\n\n\u201cThat was my first experience in English, and I lived with an English family,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was the only way to communicate.\u201d\n\nGiguere\u2019s wife, Kristen, is from Nova Scotia and speaks English and French. The Avalanche is Giguere\u2019s fifth NHL team. He said English \u201chas to be\u201d the language of team communication, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s the international language of business, and if we all need to know what\u2019s going on, we need to communicate all in one language. Everybody communicates in English very well. The communication on the ice is usually very simple, one word or two words so you don\u2019t get confused in what you\u2019re saying, so everything is in English. It\u2019s just easier that way.\u201d\n\nTerry Frei: tfrei@denverpost.com\n\nAvs\u2019 first languages\n\nENGLISH\n\nTim Army (assistant coach), Tyson Barrie, Matt Duchene, Adam Foote (defense consultant), Nate Guenin, Nick Holden, Erik Johnson, Nathan MacKinnon, Jamie McGinn, Cody McLeod, John Mitchell, Ryan O\u2019Reilly, Cory Sarich, Paul Stastny, David Van Der Gulik and Ryan Wilson.\n\nFRENCH\n\nFrancois Allaire (goaltending coach), Andre Benoit, Patrick Bordeleau, Marc-Andre Cliche, Mario Duhamel (video coach), Jean-Sebastien Giguere, P.A.
