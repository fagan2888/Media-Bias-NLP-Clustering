Is Sen. Ted Cruz, son of a Cuban immigrant, a candidate who can make a breakthrough with that crucial segment of the electorate?\n\nTexas, Cruz noted at a forum with the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, \u201cis the only majority-minority state in the country that is solidly Republican.\u201d And he added, \u201cIt\u2019s not rocket science that if Republicans continue to get clobbered in the Hispanic community it won\u2019t stay solidly Republican.\u201d\n\nJavier Palomarez, president and chief executive of the chamber, teed up the issue by noting that President Barack Obama won 72 percent of the Hispanic vote, and asserting that no future president will be elected without courting \u2014 and winning a substantial share of \u2014 that segment of the population.\n\nCruz said faith, family, patriotism and hard work are core values both for Hispanics and for Republicans.\n\n\u201cWhen was the last time you saw an Hispanic panhandler?\u201d Cruz said, emphasizing the work ethic. \u201cIn our community, it would be shameful to be begging on the street.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a line Cruz has used many times before, but now that he\u2019s running for president, it caught some attention and drew some gasps from the pundit class in his quest to paint Hispanics as \u201cfundamentally conservative\u201d and ripe for courting by the GOP.\n\nCruz asserted that Mitt Romney, the party\u2019s 2012 nominee, drew an anemic 27 percent support among Hispanics nationally because he didn\u2019t project empathy with working families.\n\n\u201cWhere he got clobbered was \u201847 percent,\u2019\u201d Cruz said, referring to Romney\u2019s estimate of the number of Americans who depend on government handouts and would never vote Republican. \u201cI cannot think of a statement in all of politics that I disagree with more strongly. \u2026 Republicans are and should be the party of the 47 percent.\u201d\n\nHe accused Democrats of holding out for unacceptable \u201camnesty\u201d provisions in the immigration fight, in order to keep using the issue as a \u201cpolitical cudgel\u201d to scare Hispanics into voting against Republicans.\n\nHe shrugged off the idea that his Spanish-language ads were tailored to airbrush stances that are unpopular with Hispanic voters. Palomarez noted that his first such ad omitted any reference to his fight against Obama\u2019s health care law, which his first English ads emphasized.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have lots of ads,\u201d Cruz said, adding that his views are no secret. \u201cI\u2019m not sure there is a voter, Hispanic or non-Hispanic, who is confused about my views on Obamacare because I have not been ambiguous. \u2026 I intend to make 2016 a referendum on repealing Obamacare.\u201d\n\nAnd, he added, \u201cI give the same speech down in the Valley that I give anywhere else in Texas.\u201d\n\nIn more than two years as a senator, Cruz has visited the Rio Grande Valley three times.\n\nCruz on Sanders\n\nOn Bloomberg Politics on Thursday, host Mark Halperin asked Cruz what he thought of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who is challenging Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton.\n\nCruz professed respect for Sanders \u2014 a self-proclaimed socialist \u2014 because he embraces a label other Democrats with similar views run from. The challenge, Cruz said, will force that party to choose \u201cwhat degree of socialism they\u2019re willing to embrace.\u201d After all, he said, \u201cHillary\u2019s economic policies often end up close to Bernie Sanders\u2019.\u201d\n\nHalperin later prodded Cruz to welcome Sanders into the race en espa\u00f1ol.\n\nThe senator declined; his Spanish skills are minimal, and apart from a few words here and there he never speaks Spanish in public.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to stick to English, se\u00f1or,\u201d Cruz said.\n\nCruz acknowledged that when he applied to Princeton and to law school at Harvard, he identified himself as Hispanic.\n\n\u201cOh sure. I\u2019ve listed myself as Cuban American,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s my heritage and my background.\u201d\n\nHalperin pressed him repeatedly to say whether he would repeal Obama\u2019s orders allowing \u201cdreamers\u201d \u2014 immigrants who were brought to the United States illegally as children \u2014 to avoid deportation.\n\nHe couldn\u2019t get a direct answer. But it sure sounded as though the answer was yes.\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m elected president, on the first day I intend to rescind \u2026 every executive action the president has taken that exceeds his constitutional authority,\u201d Cruz said.\n\nHalperin tried again. And again, Cruz argued that progress on immigration requires focusing not on divisive policies but on areas ripe for consensus, such as border security.\n\n\u201cI understand you want to talk about that, but I\u2019m telling you what I want to talk about,\u201d Cruz shot back.\n\nFollow Washington Bureau chief Todd J.
