At least 29 Hazm fighters and six Nusra Front militants were killed in the clashes, it said.\n\nAn Aleppo-based activist who goes by the name Abu al-Hassan confirmed the clashes, but put the death toll at around 20 Hazm fighters. He didn\u2019t have any information on Nusra casualties.\n\nAbu al-Hassan said by telephone that the two groups have had \u201cnumerous disagreements\u201d in recent weeks.\n\nIn November, the Nusra Front expelled a once-powerful mainstream rebel group from Syria\u2019s northern Idlib province. The al-Qaida group frequently cooperates with more-moderate rebel factions, but has turned more hard-line since the U.S. targeted Nusra Front fighters with airstrikes.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Activists say al-Qaida fighters overrun Syrian rebel bases", "title": "Activists say al-Qaida fighters overrun Syrian rebel bases", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Activists say al-Qaida fighters overrun Syrian rebel bases", "title": "Activists say al-Qaida fighters overrun Syrian rebel bases", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/02/28/activists_say_al_qaida_fighters_overrun_syrian_rebel_bases/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/02/mideast-lebanon-islamic-state-assyrians.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Activists say al-Qaida fighters overrun Syrian rebel bases", "title": "Activists say al-Qaida fighters overrun Syrian rebel bases", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/02/mideast-lebanon-islamic-state-assyrians.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Ashraf Khalil", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fceaea\"", "article_summary": "In November, the Nusra Front expelled a once-powerful mainstream rebel group from Syria\u2019s northern Idlib province.\nTopics: From the Wires, NewsBEIRUT (AP) \u2014 Syria\u2019s al-Qaida affiliate overran bases belonging to a Western-backed rebel group near the northern city of Aleppo after heavy clashes that killed at least 20 fighters, activists said Saturday.\nThe al-Qaida group frequently cooperates with more-moderate rebel factions, but has turned more hard-line since the U.S. targeted Nusra Front fighters with airstrikes.\nThe Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Nusra Front fighters seized control of several Hazm bases.\nAn Aleppo-based activist who goes by the name Abu al-Hassan confirmed the clashes, but put the death toll at around 20 Hazm fighters."}
