He perfected it in the lead-up to the Vancouver Olympics and landed it on his second run there.\n\nHe said he\u2019s pleased with the 1440 and has no problem showing the competition what he has up his sleeve.\n\n\u201cJust because you can see the trick doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s easy to duplicate,\u201d he said.\n\nWhite hurt his left ankle during a halfpipe run at the Dew Tour in Breckenridge. He ended up finishing second, then pulled out of the halfpipe the next week at Copper Mountain so he could focus on slopestyle.\n\nThe next selection event starts Jan. 8 in Breckenridge, giving White a few weeks to heal. Through the first two halfpipe qualifiers, few competitors have tried anything more than a double-cork 1080, meaning there may not be any pressure on White to unveil either of his two biggest tricks.\n\nOf course, the two-time defending Olympic champion doesn\u2019t always see things that way.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to just do those tricks,\u201d he said a few days before he hurt his ankle. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to do them, do them now. It\u2019s a new one I\u2019m hoping to slide into the run.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Shaun White has new trick up his sleeve \u2014 with a twist", "title": "Shaun White has new trick up his sleeve \u2014 with a twist", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/12/26/shaun-white-has-new-trick-up-his-sleeve-with-a-twist/", "image": {"width": 446, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131226__20131227_B2_SP27SHELFp1.jpg", "height": 654}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131226__20131227_B2_SP27SHELFp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-12-26T22:14:23+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-29T09:41:18+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7f63\"", "article_summary": "On a video posted to a sponsor\u2019s YouTube site Thursday, White shows the world the trick he\u2019s been working on for the upcoming Olympics.\nWhite hurt his left ankle during a halfpipe run at the Dew Tour in Breckenridge.\nHe perfected it in the lead-up to the Vancouver Olympics and landed it on his second run there.\n\u201cJust that subtle a change, it throws the whole axis of the trick off,\u201d White told The Associated Press recently.\nIt\u2019s a frontside double-cork 1440, which resembles his Double McTwist 1260 but adds another half revolution of twist inside the two head-over-heels flips."}
