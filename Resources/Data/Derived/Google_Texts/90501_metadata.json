Out of 418 injuries, only 164 were serious enough to require the women to stop participating in gymnastics for more than a day.\n\nEquipment changes, such as shock-absorbing mats to soften landings and a new vaulting table with a larger, cushioned push-off surface may have helped limit serious injuries, said lead author Zachary Kerr of the Datalys Center for Sports Injury Research and Prevention in Indianapolis, Indiana.\n\nAthletic trainers can also minimize the risk of serious injuries, Kerr added.\n\n\u201cBy having athletic trainers on site, organizations may be able to reduce the severity of injury because diagnosis and management of the injuries occur almost immediately,\u201d Kerr said by email.\n\nBy separating out injuries that forced athletes to sit out practices and competitions, Kerr and colleagues found injury rates that were lower than earlier data from the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) might suggest, they report in the Journal of Athletic Training.\n\nThe researchers measured injury rates against what\u2019s known as athletic exposures (AEs), which occur each time one athlete participates in one practice or game that has the potential to result in an injury.\n\nOver the course of the study, the overall injury rate was 9.22 per 1,000 AEs. But looking only at injuries serious enough for women to miss more than a day of practice, the injury rate fell to 3.62 per 1,000 AEs.\n\nPractices didn\u2019t appear as dangerous as competitions. The practice injury rate was 8.69 per 1,000 AEs, compared with 14.49 per 1,000 AEs for competitions.\n\nMost injuries involved ankles, lower legs, Achilles tendon, trunk or foot, the study found.\n\nFloor exercises accounted for about 42 percent of the 291 injuries reported while athletes were using an apparatus, followed by the uneven bars, which were tied to 29 percent of these injuries.\n\nThe researchers didn't have data on all college teams, theyacknowledge. They also didn't know the duration of practices and competitions, making it impossible to determine how the amount of time doing gymnastics might relate to risk of injury.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that some injuries were averted altogether or less severe because coaches have gotten smarter about avoiding overtraining and excessive repetition of the most dangerous skills, said Dr. John O\u2019Kane, intercollegiate athletics medical director at the University of Washington in Seattle.\n\n\u201cCollege gymnastics teams have small rosters and the loss of two or three key competitors can doom a season,\u201d O\u2019Kane, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study, said by email. \u201cI think coaches have become smarter about this and work harder to avoid injuries, particularly those involving significant time loss.\u201d\n\nEven when injuries don\u2019t require time off, there is a downside to getting back into the swing of things less than a day after an injury, said Randy Cohen, an athletic trainer and associate athletics director for medical services at the University of Arizona in Tucson.\n\n\u201cTime-loss injuries do prevent athletes from participating in practice and competitions, however, when they are out they can focus on rest, treatments, rehabilitation and getting better,\u201d Cohen, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study, said by email. \u201cWhen you have non-time loss injuries they require treatment and rehabilitation while continuing to practice and compete.\u201d\n\n(Reporting by Lisa Rapaport)", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "most, womens, gymnastics, injuries, dont, sideline, college, athletes", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Fewer than half of injuries in women\u2019s collegiate gymnastics are serious enough to sideline athletes for more than one day, a U.S. study suggests.", "title": "Most Women\u2019s Gymnastics Injuries Don\u2019t Sideline College Athletes", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/most-womens-gymnastics-injuries-dont-sideline-college-athletes-348832", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/08/20/gymnastics.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Fewer than half of injuries in women\u2019s collegiate gymnastics are serious enough to sideline athletes for more than one day, a U.S. study suggests.", "title": "Most Women\u2019s Gymnastics Injuries Don\u2019t Sideline College Athletes", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/most-womens-gymnastics-injuries-dont-sideline-college-athletes-348832", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/08/20/gymnastics.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/08/20/gymnastics.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-08-20T16:36:28-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-20T16:36:27-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Fewer than half of injuries in women\u2019s collegiate gymnastics are serious enough to sideline athletes for more than one day, a U.S. study suggests."}, "article_summary": "(Reuters Health) - Fewer than half of injuries in women\u2019s collegiate gymnastics are serious enough to sideline athletes for more than one day, a U.S. study suggests.\nAthletic trainers can also minimize the risk of serious injuries, Kerr added.\nOut of 418 injuries, only 164 were serious enough to require the women to stop participating in gymnastics for more than a day.\nThe practice injury rate was 8.69 per 1,000 AEs, compared with 14.49 per 1,000 AEs for competitions.\nBut looking only at injuries serious enough for women to miss more than a day of practice, the injury rate fell to 3.62 per 1,000 AEs."}
