John Barrow decries how much Congress sucks, and emphasizes how he turned down congressional perks. There are a billion ads by incumbent members of Congress like this, but Barrow's spot still favorably stands out.

Bill Enyart as someone who votes against the middle class.\n\n\u2022 LA-05: The Club for Growth goes after Republican Rep.
