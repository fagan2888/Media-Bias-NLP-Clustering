It doesn\u2019t make for a very coherent lineup, but maybe a slate of shows that logically lead into one another matters far less than a bunch of attention-grabbing gambits.\n\nAnd so it is that a western movie produced by Nicholas Sparks, the writer\u2019s TV debut, ended up on Lifetime\u2019s air. Sparks is the novelist whose works (\u201cThe Notebook,\u201d \u201cDear John,\u201d \u201cThe Lucky One,\u201d \u201cSafe Haven\u201d) are unusually easy to adapt into films. The Nicholas Sparks movie, at this point a genre all its own, stars inexpensive actors and features a plot that\u2019s heavy on sentiment if a bit light on reason. (\u201cSafe Haven,\u201d his most recent film, revealed at its end that a central character had been a protective ghost the whole time.) Each novel basically feels like a blueprint for an eventual movie. Cutting out the middleman, as Lifetime has done, would seem more efficient \u2014 Sparks is the executive producer of \u201cDeliverance Creek,\u201d but it\u2019s not based on any existing material.\n\nThis would certainly seem to be Sparks\u2019 B-material, had he written it \u2014 it\u2019s airing on TV rather than hitting theaters timed to Valentine\u2019s Day, and the logline is about a widow protecting her family, rather than getting into a torrid affair that heals her broken heart. (The movie is intended as a \u201cbackdoor pilot\u201d to test the waters for a potential series.)", "article_metadata": {"description": "The \"Notebook\" author is a perfect fit for the least pretentious cable network ever", "author": "Daniel D'Addario", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The \"Notebook\" author is a perfect fit for the least pretentious cable network ever", "title": "Nicholas Sparks makes his first foray into television", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/09/11/nicholas_sparks_makes_his_first_foray_into_television/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/deliverance_creek.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The \"Notebook\" author is a perfect fit for the least pretentious cable network ever", "creator": "@dpd_", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/deliverance_creek.jpg", "title": "Nicholas Sparks makes his first foray into television", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Nicholas Sparks makes his first foray into television", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, lifetime, nicholas sparks, TV", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The Nicholas Sparks movie, at this point a genre all its own, stars inexpensive actors and features a plot that\u2019s heavy on sentiment if a bit light on reason.\nAnd so it is that a western movie produced by Nicholas Sparks, the writer\u2019s TV debut, ended up on Lifetime\u2019s air.\nSparks is the novelist whose works (\u201cThe Notebook,\u201d \u201cDear John,\u201d \u201cThe Lucky One,\u201d \u201cSafe Haven\u201d) are unusually easy to adapt into films.\n(\u201cSafe Haven,\u201d his most recent film, revealed at its end that a central character had been a protective ghost the whole time.)\n(The movie is intended as a \u201cbackdoor pilot\u201d to test the waters for a potential series.)"}
