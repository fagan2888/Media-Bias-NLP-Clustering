Ackman\u2019s actions deprived shareholders who sold stock to him of $1.2 billion in value gains, the lawsuit says.\n\nValeant made its initial bid for Allergan on April 22 for $48 billion. It has since upped that to $53 billion.\n\nThe complaint is asking the court to declare that Valeant and Ackman violated securities laws and that it order rescinding of Pershing\u2019s purchase of the Allergan shares.\n\nThe lawsuit appears to be an attempt to thwart a coming shareholder vote on the merger by forcing Ackman to sell his stake in Allergan. Ackman\u2019s shares, plus his influence among investors, is considered critical in bringing the matter to a vote.\n\nLater on Friday, Valeant and Ackman countered that the Allergan lawsuit was \u201cfrivolous\u201d and \u201cbaseless.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a shameless attempt by Allergan to delay the shareholders\u2019 fundamental right to call a special meeting and vote their shares,\u201d Ackman said in a prepared statement. \u201cAllergan is threatened by our progress toward calling the special meeting. This scorched-earth approach is further evidence of the board\u2019s and management\u2019s entrenchment.\u201d\n\nValeant Chairman and Chief Executive J. Michael Pearson added: \u201cWe are disappointed that Allergan continues to stand in the way of its shareholders\u2019 right to voice their views on a transaction with Valeant. Despite Allergan\u2019s attempted roadblocks, we remain committed to pursuing this compelling combination, which will create an unrivaled platform for growth and value creation.\u201d\n\nAllergan, meanwhile, says in its complaint that debt-laden Valeant \u2014 which it has accused of being a \u201cserial acquirer\u201d \u2014 did not have the cash to buy Allergan and so it sought the help of Ackman. Valeant also took several steps to make a tender offer for Allergan prior to reaching an agreement with Pershing Square, the suit alleges.\n\nShares of both Allergan and Valeant were off marginally in afternoon trades.\n\nFollow @russbrittmktw\n\nFollow @MWHealthBlog\n\nMore must-read health coverage from MarketWatch:\n\nObamacare rate hikes to average 4% in California in 2015\n\nHow health care has swallowed the U.S. economy, in one map\n\nKhosla: Your cell phone may soon be your doctor", "article_metadata": {"article.created": "2014-08-01T12:38:38-04:00", "application-name": "MarketWatch.com", "twitter": {"domain": "Marketwatch.com", "description": "The takeover battle between suitor Valeant Pharmaceuticals and Allergan Inc. has spilled over into the courts with Allergan filing a federal lawsuit Friday against Valeant.", "title": "Allergan files suit, accuses Valeant and Ackman of insider trading", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2014/08/01/allergan-files-suit-accuses-valeant-and-ackman-of-insider-trading/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-CL573_allerg_MG_20140707131009.jpg"}, "site": "MarketWatch", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.author": "Russ Britt", "article.section": "Markets", "keywords": "Allergan Inc.,federal lawsuit,insider trading allegations,mergers and acquisitions,Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc.", "article.headline": "Allergan files suit, accuses Valeant and Ackman of insider trading", "msapplication-task": "name=SmartMoney;action-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/;icon-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/favicon.ico", "news_keywords": "Allergan Inc.,federal lawsuit,insider trading allegations,mergers and acquisitions,Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc.", "author": "Russ Britt", "article.page": "Health Exchange Blog", "description": "The takeover battle between suitor Valeant Pharmaceuticals and Allergan Inc. has spilled over into the courts with Allergan filing a federal lawsuit Friday against Valeant.", "article.published": "2014-08-01T12:38:38-04:00", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "msapplication-tooltip": "MarketWatch", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2014/08/01/allergan-files-suit-accuses-valeant-and-ackman-of-insider-trading/", "app_id": 283204329838}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch", "image_count": 2}, "og": {"site_name": "Marketwatch", "description": "The takeover battle between suitor Valeant Pharmaceuticals and Allergan Inc. has spilled over into the courts with Allergan filing a federal lawsuit Friday against Valeant.", "title": "Allergan files suit, accuses Valeant and Ackman of insider trading", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2014/08/01/allergan-files-suit-accuses-valeant-and-ackman-of-insider-trading/", "image": {"width": 569, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-CL573_allerg_MG_20140707131009.jpg", "height": 398}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Health Exchange", "article.id": "BL-MW243B-2901", "article.updated": "2014-08-01T16:02:14-04:00"}, "article_summary": "Allergan /quotes/zigman/217110/delayed /quotes/nls/agn AGN names activist investor William Ackman, whose Pershing Square Capital Management hedge fund owns nearly 10% of Allergan, in the lawsuit.\nAllergan charges that Pershing Square bought $3.2 billion in Allergan shares between February and April of this year while fully aware of Valeant\u2019s takeover intentions.\nValeant also took several steps to make a tender offer for Allergan prior to reaching an agreement with Pershing Square, the suit alleges.\nThe takeover battle between suitor Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. and acquisition target Allergan Inc. has spilled over into the courts with Allergan filing a federal lawsuit Friday against Valeant, alleging insider trading and other offenses.\nThe complaint is asking the court to declare that Valeant and Ackman violated securities laws and that it order rescinding of Pershing\u2019s purchase of the Allergan shares."}
