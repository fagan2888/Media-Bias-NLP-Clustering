Long the place for Gospel quotes and Christmas Eve sermon hours, now the signs are often clever, pithy or funny. But pastors are finding that joking about religion is a serious business, and it\u2019s easy to cross a line.\n\n****\n\nWhen Darrin Lee launched his suburban Detroit church six years ago, he had just 11 members, a rickety old building and a plywood board marquee. The sign was replaced, thanks to a benefactor\u2019s $5,000 donation, with a roadside one Lee now uses for slogans he credits for helping his Cornerstone Baptist Church flock grow to more than 100.\n\n\u201cI think that sign added life to this church, saying, \u2018Hey, we\u2019re up to date. We\u2019re not some old relic church,\u2019 \u201d he said from his church, which is passed daily by about 45,000 vehicles. \u201cWhen you look at other churches with marquees that don\u2019t put up messages, I think they\u2019re missing the boat.\u201d\n\nHe has hit a few bumps, though. One of his slogans \u2014 \u201cDon\u2019t Let Worry Kill You. Let The Church Help\u201d \u2014 made the rounds on Facebook and Twitter, leaving him to offer the obligatory confirmation that \u201cobviously we\u2019re not in the killing business.\u201d\n\nOne caller wanted to chat about evolution after his marquee read: \u201cIf Man Came From Apes, Why Do We Still Have Apes.\u201d\n\nDozens of websites and social media sites collect pictures of church signage, celebrating those that seem to work \u2014 \u201cMany Who Seek God at the Eleventh Hour Die at 10:30\u201d \u2014 or panning others, such as, \u201cStop, Drop and Roll Doesn\u2019t Work in Hell.\u201d\n\nSome even inspired books. Pam Paulson and her husband, Steve, took a four-year, 122,000-mile trek through all 50 states to chronicle interesting church marquees after noticing the changing signs at two churches near their Florida home. With a van full of hundreds of maps, it was a slow go after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, with churches seldom straying from patriotic themes. But around the middle of the decade, Pam Paulson said, cleverer messages began emerging.\n\n\u201cA lot of people we talked to thought it was just a good way to get people to at least acknowledge their church. It was true,\u201d the 59-year-old Methodist said. \u201cWe weren\u2019t looking for the humorous, but they were always the ones that caught our attention.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s the point, according to Wes Henson, pastor at the Walnut Street Baptist Church in the southern Illinois city of Carbondale. He admitted he once drew an earful from a woman angry about the potential sexual innuendo when his marquee read, \u201cWaking up and shouting, \u2018Oh God\u2019 is not the same as being in church.\u201d\n\n\u201cI guess I did that on a day I felt bold and confident,\u201d Henson said. \u201cBut when you have something on there that catches attention, at least for a moment, it means at least they\u2019re thinking about your church.\u201d\n\nChurches largely are left on their own when it comes to marquees. The 13 million-member United Methodist Church doesn\u2019t tell its congregations what to write, said Larry Holland, the church\u2019s global communications chief. But it offers a big suggestion: Make them welcoming, nonjudgmental and theologically accurate.\n\n\u201cWe do take them seriously because they are a communications level. We consider them to be grassroots,\u201d Holland said.\n\n****\n\nBut the messages should be fresh and avoid negative slogans, such as \u201c \u2018hell\u2019s waiting for you\u2019 kinda thing,\u201d said Woody Murray, a former advertising agency worker who in recent years wrote a column about church signs.\n\n\u201cA clever message wears old in a few days, like television commercials that have a joke,\u201d said Murray, a suburban Nashville Baptist now working for Gideons International. \u201cOnce you see it, you don\u2019t wanna see it again.\u201d\n\nSources of the signage run the gamut, from sermons to pithy themes found on road trips. At West Salem Trinity United Methodist Church in southern Illinois\u2019 Mount Vernon, Brad Henson gets much of his guidance from the Internet \u2014 making the task far easier than when he used a 3-inch-thick book of illustrations.\n\nHenson, whose church sign has sported such messages as \u201cA closed mouth gathers no foot\u201d and \u201cDairy Queen is not the only place that has awesome Sundays,\u201d acknowledged that motorists who see his signs may never come into his church.\n\nBut that\u2019s not his goal. Henson said it\u2019s simply about preaching in a different, sometimes softer, way with messages that provoke thought or provide comfort to those passing by.", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Wed, 25 Dec 2013 22:58:38 -0400", "Description": "Pastor Mike Butzberger insists he only had holiday spirit in mind when his North Palm Beach church\u2019s marquee read: \u201cChristmas \u2014 Easier to spell than Hanukkah.\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "Pastor Mike Butzberger insists he only had holiday spirit in mind when his North Palm Beach church\u2019s marquee read: \u201cChristmas \u2014 Easier to spell than Hanukkah.\u201d", "title": "Pastors tread fine line with church marquee messages", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/faith/pastors-tread-fine-line-with-church-marquee-messages-20131225/", "image": {"width": 3460, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20131225/ARTICLE/131229621/EP/1/2/EP-131229621.jpg", "height": 2160}, "updated_time": "2013-12-25T23:15:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "Pastor Mike Butzberger insists he only had holiday spirit in mind when his North Palm Beach church\u2019s marquee read: \u201cChristmas \u2014 Easier to spell than Hanukkah.\u201d", "title": "Pastors tread fine line with church marquee messages", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20131225/ARTICLE/131229621/AR/0/AR-131229621.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2013-12-25T22:58:38Z-04", "modified_time": "2013-12-25T23:15:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "We\u2019re not some old relic church,\u2019 \u201d he said from his church, which is passed daily by about 45,000 vehicles.\nBut pastors are finding that joking about religion is a serious business, and it\u2019s easy to cross a line.\n****When Darrin Lee launched his suburban Detroit church six years ago, he had just 11 members, a rickety old building and a plywood board marquee.\nPam Paulson and her husband, Steve, took a four-year, 122,000-mile trek through all 50 states to chronicle interesting church marquees after noticing the changing signs at two churches near their Florida home.\nHenson, whose church sign has sported such messages as \u201cA closed mouth gathers no foot\u201d and \u201cDairy Queen is not the only place that has awesome Sundays,\u201d acknowledged that motorists who see his signs may never come into his church."}
