Would Draghi\u2019s plans to implement an ambitious policy of monetary stimulus get bulldozed by German inflation hawks and others favoring continued austerity across the Continent?\n\nEven a week ago there seemed little reason to ask such questions. Not anymore. Draghi appears set to leave Frankfurt and return to his native Italy the first chance he gets.\n\nThis could be as soon as January, depending on a variety of circumstances in Frankfurt and Rome, according to well-placed sources who include a prominent private investor and a senior journalist in Rome. \u201cDraghi wants out, fed up and stymied by Berlin,\u201d one of these sources wrote in a note just before the weekend. In a subsequent message: \u201cI am hearing from several [official] sources that he is entirely fed up with the monetary politics he confronts.\u201d\n\nRelated: Germans Resist ECB Money-Printing Move\n\nDraghi, indeed, has been in an intensifying battle with the austerian camp for months. Notable among his adversaries is the hyper-hawkish Jens Weidman, president of the Bundesbank, who seems never to miss a chance to strike via public comment against Draghi\u2019s proposal to extend the ECB\u2019s asset-purchasing program, launched earlier this year, to include government bonds as well as asset-backed securities.\n\nWhether Draghi remains the European Union\u2019s central banker now appears to depend on the political future of a man widely noted for his ambition. \u201cThe issue now is to engineer Draghi\u2019s transition to the post of president in Italy,\u201d as one of my sources tells me\u2014and as all of them agree. \u201cHe would leave the ECB only if they [Draghi\u2019s supporters] can get the transition from Frankfurt to Rome in place.\u201d\n\nQuestions arise instantly.\n\nWhy would \u201cMr. Whatever It Takes,\u201d who has proven a determined and effective builder of consensus in favor of a Keynesian recovery strategy, walk off the field before the game\u2019s over?\n\nIt is indeed a little surprising that Draghi wants to step down now. While his war with German-led austerians has been a slog, Draghi has gradually shifted opinion in his direction. As noted in this space last week, a victory on the question of government-bond purchases now appears in the offing.\n\nItalian sources, moreover, dismiss the thought that Draghi is succumbing to the Bundesbank\u2019s relentless resistance in what amounts to a war of attrition. \u201cFatigue doesn\u2019t explain this,\u201d the editor in Rome says. \u201cThere are a lot of people in Germany who\u2019d be happy if Draghi were no longer in Frankfurt, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a question of being tired.\u201d\n\nRelated: ECB\u2019s Draghi Concerned About Oil Price on Eurozone Economy\n\nSome observers in Italy reckon that Draghi thinks he has done all he can at the ECB. But it\u2019s some and some on this point.\n\n\u201cThere are others here who say Italy now needs a president who can reassure Europe as to the direction of Italian reform policies,\u201d my journalist colleague in Rome tells me. \u201cDraghi rates high in this respect.\u201d\n\nWhy would Draghi cash in a position of considerable international influence to take up the figurehead presidency of a mid-sized European power?\n\nAgain, no simple answers. Contrary to appearances, Draghi may have concluded recently that he won\u2019t prevail against his austerian adversaries, some sources suggest. It is more likely that, as everyone has already concluded, he recognizes that there are no promising alternatives to succeed Giorgio Napolitano, who is expected to step down as president early next year. \u201cDraghi\u2019s a last resort for Italian politicians,\u201d in the estimation of one informed source.\n\nFor his part, Draghi denies that he has any presidential ambitions\u2014or any plans to pack up in Frankfurt, for that matter. But my sources advise that we assign these assertions zero credibility. Draghi went home in mid-November to deliver a speech on ECB policy to students at the University of Rome, and the occasion was widely taken to be a toe in the water prior to a full-dress presidential candidacy.\n\nWhat are the chances Draghi will find the post-ECB berth he wants in Italy?\n\nMore complications. Reflecting discontent over cutbacks in funding for Italian universities and public services, the university speech bombed, provoking street protests, arrests, and a smattering of violence. While the president is elected by deputies in the two legislative chambers and heads of Italy\u2019s regional governments, that scene was damaging.\n\nRelated: Failure to Reform Threatens Eurozone, ECB\u2019s Draghi Warns\n\n\u201cHe has to be \u2018sellable\u2019 in a broader sense to the Italian public, so the address to the University of Roma was not a plus,\u201d a source writes in a note. \u201cHe gave a political speech, and the students gave him, shall we say, a political reception.\u201d\n\nAnother factor evident here is Prime Minister Matteo Renzi. One, sources say he appears to think he can make more use of Draghi in Frankfurt than at home. Two, there are indications he doesn\u2019t want a figure of Draghi\u2019s weight and international stature crowding into his picture frame.\n\nThe weakness of other candidates\u2014Romano Prodi, a former prime minister, and Giuliano Amato, a former interior minister and now a member of the constitutional court\u2014again comes into play. Even with the failed speech and Renzi\u2019s probable resistance in view, a source in Rome concludes, \u201cIf Draghi opens the door it won\u2019t be difficult to reach the needed consensus. He\u2019ll get it if he wants it.\u201d\n\nRelated: As Deflation Looms, It\u2019s Europe\u2019s Moment of Truth\n\nDoes, he, truly?\n\nIt appears he does, although nobody has a map of either Draghi\u2019s heart or mind. In any case, we\u2019ll know more soon. Presidents customarily deliver end-of-year speeches, and Napolitano is expected to say more as to when he\u2019ll step down in the one due shortly.\n\n\u201cThe probability now is he\u2019ll leave in the second half of January, in which case the voting will start at the end of January,\u201d the Roman editor says. Watch this space. Draghi\u2019s hat will be in or out in little more than a month.\n\nWhat if he goes for it? What of ECB policy then?\n\nThis is another of Draghi\u2019s considerations, according to a source plugged into the Frankfurt institution. Tired or not, he is hardly likely to walk away from what he has so far achieved, and the indications given this columnist are that ECB policy would be instantly vulnerable to hard-line inflation hawks were he to drop the guard abruptly.\n\n\u201cMaking sure that austerity Europe doesn\u2019t grab hold of the ECB presidency,\u201d as this source puts it, could thus have a lot to do with Draghi\u2019s timing\u2014if not, indeed, with the decision itself.\n\nThis last is reassuring. Europe needs big, ambitious stimulus measures badly, and for the moment it follows that Europe needs Draghi. \u201cFor a lot of us here,\u201d the Italian editor said by telephone the other day, \u201cDraghi is much more useful in Frankfurt than he would be here.\u201d\n\nI second the thought. Mr. Whatever It Takes, you\u2019ve chosen a hell of a time for a career crisis, it must be said. Best for the global economy altogether if you live up to the expression you made famous when the chips were down a couple of years back, please.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "What would happen to Europe\u2019s prospects for recovery if Mario Draghi left his job as p", "title": "Why the Hell Does Mario Draghi Want to Leave the ECB Now!?", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2014/12/08/Why-Hell-Does-Mario-Draghi-Want-Leave-ECB-Now", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/wpid-2012-08-29T111439Z_1_CBRE87S0V8K00_RTROPTP_2_ECB-RATES-DRAGHI.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2014/12/08/Why-Hell-Does-Mario-Draghi-Want-Leave-ECB-Now", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/wpid-2012-08-29T111439Z_1_CBRE87S0V8K00_RTROPTP_2_ECB-RATES-DRAGHI.jpg", "creator": "@psmith7600", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "What would happen to Europe\u2019s prospects for recovery if Mario Draghi left his job as p", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Draghi appears set to leave Frankfurt and return to his native Italy the first chance he gets.\n\u201cDraghi wants out, fed up and stymied by Berlin,\u201d one of these sources wrote in a note just before the weekend.\nIt is indeed a little surprising that Draghi wants to step down now.\n\u201cHe would leave the ECB only if they [Draghi\u2019s supporters] can get the transition from Frankfurt to Rome in place.\u201dQuestions arise instantly.\nItalian sources, moreover, dismiss the thought that Draghi is succumbing to the Bundesbank\u2019s relentless resistance in what amounts to a war of attrition."}
