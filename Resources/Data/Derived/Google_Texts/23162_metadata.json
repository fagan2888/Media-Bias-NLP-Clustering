Land of the free, home of the brave, and the greatest country on the face of the planet, right? A country with seemingly limitless natural resources, and according to many politicians, anointed by God herself to lead the world out of the wilderness and into a bright new age of liberty and justice for all. Too bad the road to that vision is pockmarked with so many potholes, because we haven\u2019t raised enough taxes on people who can afford to pay to fill them.\n\nAmericans, maybe more than anyone on Earth, are guilty of the sin of hubris and excessive pride. As the great Greek poets of the ancient world have taught us, hubris can lead to some really bad outcomes.The reality is that a good portion of the rest of the world has far outpaced the United States in things like healthcare. While the U.S. has painstakingly cobbled together a convoluted insurance-friendly monster called Obamacare (remarkable mostly for how much better it is than what we had), the rest of the developed world enjoys one-payer government healthcare that outperforms the U.S. in both cost and quality of care. The proof is in the pudding; they live longer than Americans.\n\nBut healthcare is not the only way America lags behind the rest of the world. Here are 11 things other countries do better than us.\n\n1. Food waste reduction.\n\nIn a country as bountiful as the United States, it is remarkable how many people are hungry. Almost 50 million Americans, present to some degree in every single county of the country, live in a food-insecure household. Meanwhile, while children go to bed on empty stomachs, up to 40% of the food supply, more than 20 pounds of food per person per month, is wasted. That\u2019s $165 billion worth of food thrown out. Factor in all the water, energy and land used to produce this waste and it borders on criminal.\n\nFrance has a better way. This year, national French law banned the disposal of unsold food. Instead, the food must be donated to charity or used as animal feed. Food-related businesses are now required to sign up with a charity and donate unsold food. The food must be in a state ready for consumption (to save the charities the time and money to prepare it). The law also incorporates an education program to inform schools, businesses and the general public about the food waste problem. The goal is to cut food waste in France in half by 2025.\n\n2. College loans.\n\nThe cost of a college education in the United States has skyrocketed in recent years, as any debt-ridden college grad can tell you. A political frenzy of tax-cutting fever has hobbled monetary support for public universities, especially at the state government level, and private college tuition has reached unaffordable heights mostly due to reckless spending and administrative bloat. Caught in this upward spiral are lower- and middle-class students who now leave school with college debt approaching $30,000 on average, crippling their ability to accept lower paying but attractive jobs, relocate, or even move out of their parents\u2019 homes.\n\nMost developed countries scratch their heads at the idea that we must burden our children with debt in order to educate them and strengthen the nation. In countries like Germany, Iceland, Brazil, Norway, even Panama, public university tuition is free. Even in the United Kingdom, although education isn\u2019t free, the government allows students to pay loans back based on their income, reducing the pressure of debt and allowing more freedom of choice upon completion of college. Additionally, the UK writes off the debt after 30 years if it has not been paid back. Compare that to the US, where nothing, not even bankruptcy, erases college debt.\n\n3. Maternity leave.\n\nWe hear a lot of wistful nostalgia from the right-wing political establishment about the good ol\u2019 days, when mothers were home taking care of their children and parents were ever-present in their lives. Yet the same politicians gnash their teeth at any hint of government help that would go a long way to realizing their nostalgic dreams. Maternity leave policy in the United States is left entirely to the whims of individual states, and in many cases, to the whims of individual employers. The federal government guarantees only unpaid leave. Meanwhile, the burden of paying bills forces many mothers to get back to work as soon as they are able.\n\nIn many other countries, maternity leave is guaranteed and even paid for. Denmark guarantees a full year of paid maternity leave, to be split between mother and father, for all public sector employees. France, Spain, the Netherlands and Austria offer four months fully paid leave. Croatia, a year. Russia, 20 weeks. Serbia, a year. And on it goes.\n\n4. The rights of the Earth.\n\nThe recent Supreme Court decision struck a blow against clean air, allowing coal-fired power plants to emit minimal amounts of mercury and other poisonous pollutants into the atmosphere. The Environmental Protection Agency is in a constant battle against conservatives who are tirelessly working to cripple the agency\u2019s power to limit air, water and ground pollution.\n\nIn Ecuador, they have a different perspective. In 2008, Ecuadoreans rewrote their constitution and became the first country to recognize the rights of natureto defend itself against humankind. The constitution recognized nature\u2019s right to \u201cexist, persist, maintain and regenerate its vital cycles.\u201d Citizens have the right, by law, to enforce nature\u2019s rights, and nature itself can be named as the defendant in Ecuador\u2019s court system. Nature is acknowledged not as the property of humans to do with as we please, but as an equal partner in the protection and health of the planet.\n\n5. Wi-Fi service.\n\nIn the United States, as in much of the developed world, Wi-Fi access to the Internet is considered a private service for which we pay to use. And we pay dearly. Not only is Wi-Fi service slower in America, we also pay twice as much or more than our world counterparts. The reason for this is pretty clear. In the U.S., most of our Wi-Fi infrastructure is controlled by a very few monopolistic companies, like Time Warner and Comcast. No competition equals high prices and lousy service.\n\nIn the tiny country of Estonia, Wi-Fi access is free to all. In Estonia, you can walk outside for miles and never lose your Internet connection. And 97% of schools have Internet. Compare that to only half the schools in the United States, a country infinitely richer. Ninety-four percent of tax returns in Estonia are done online. Voting can be done online. Doctor\u2019s prescriptions are issued online. Access to information. Banking. All this and more in a country where half the citizens literally had no phones 20 years ago.", "article_metadata": {"description": "When it comes to food waste, vacation time and student loans, the U.S. is anything but a beacon for the free world", "title": "11 things the rest of the world does so much better than America", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "When it comes to food waste, vacation time and student loans, the U.S. is anything but a beacon for the free world", "title": "11 things the rest of the world does so much better than America", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/07/10/11_things_the_rest_of_the_world_does_so_much_better_than_america_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/shutterstock_150161552.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "When it comes to food waste, vacation time and student loans, the U.S. is anything but a beacon for the free world", "title": "11 things the rest of the world does so much better than America", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/shutterstock_150161552.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Larry Schwartz", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, AlterNet, College loans, Maternity leave, student loans", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd96b8\"", "article_summary": "Maternity leave.\nDenmark guarantees a full year of paid maternity leave, to be split between mother and father, for all public sector employees.\nIn a country as bountiful as the United States, it is remarkable how many people are hungry.\nTopics: AlterNet, College loans, Maternity leave, student loans, Politics NewsThis article originally appeared on AlterNetAmerica!\nCompare that to only half the schools in the United States, a country infinitely richer."}
