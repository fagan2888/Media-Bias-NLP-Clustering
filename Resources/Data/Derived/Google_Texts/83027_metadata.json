Additionally, many of those donors are sharing information about their largesse on social websites, prompting others to make contributions, the report said.\n\n\u201cI would say social media is a great supplement to our traditional fundraising,\u201d said Linda Biller, regional chief development officer with the Tampa Bay chapter of the American Red Cross. \u201cSocial media\u2019s large presence today reaches so many individuals, it allows us to spread the word and help folks identify with our organization and to make a gift.\n\nThe organization uses social media to get the word out when it responds to disasters and helps people, she said, and that in turn coaxes potential donors to immediately pledge money.\n\nThe online survey of 1,021 adults done in October found that 71 percent of those active on online social networks donated to a charity over the previous year. Of those, six in 10 made their donations online. The poll also found that personal appeals from friends matter more than trending topics.\n\nSeven in 10 social media users said they would take some kind of action, including sharing the post, in response to a friend posting a story on social media about making a charitable donation. While only 3 percent of respondents said social media was the most effective way for a charity to solicit donations, 19 percent said they would likely donate money to a charity if they saw a friend post about a recent donation.\n\nThe survey also found that:\n\n\u2666 while trends online and in the media draw attention to a charity, 72 percent said a charity\u2019s popularity makes no difference in a donor\u2019s decision to contribute;\n\n\u2666 social media users are interested in giving \u2014 not receiving \u2014 as 51 percent said that receiving a memento in exchange for a charitable donation would not increase their likelihood to give.\n\nMost large nonprofits rely on regular contributions from businesses and corporations, and social media donors typically are individuals. Social media increasingly is a way to connect with those individuals.\n\nThe ALS Association, which supports a cure for Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease, turned a few non-profit heads this year when a fundraising effort exploded across social media. The \u201cIce Bucket Challenge\u201d swept Facebook and Twitter this summer and raised millions for the cause.\n\n\u201cSocial media plays an important role in building philanthropic support because it allows us to build relationships with donors on their terms,\u201d said Kim Hanna, president and CEO of the ALS Association Florida Chapter.\n\n\u201cWe have tweaked our strategies after lessons learned from the \u2018Ice Bucket Challenge,\u2019 she said. \u201cSocial media has replaced traditional email as a desired form of receiving communications, so we let donors know how their donation made an impact through social media instead of just email or mail.\u201d\n\nkmorelli@tampatrib.com\n\n(813) 259-7760", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sun, 14 Dec 2014 14:25:55 -0400", "Description": "TAMPA \u2014 A recent survey commissioned by the American Red Cross suggests that social media may be the new frontier for fundraising, though officials stopped short in saying it will take over tr", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "TAMPA \u2014 A recent survey commissioned by the American Red Cross suggests that social media may be the new frontier for fundraising, though officials stopped short in saying it will take over tr", "title": "Charities learning importance of social media in fundraising", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/news/breaking-news/charities-learning-importance-of-social-media-in-fundraising-20141214/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20141214/ARTICLE/141219589/AR/0/AR-141219589.jpg", "height": 340}, "updated_time": "2014-12-15T09:09:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "TAMPA \u2014 A recent survey commissioned by the American Red Cross suggests that social media may be the new frontier for fundraising, though officials stopped short in saying it will take over", "title": "Charities learning importance of social media in fundraising", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20141214/ARTICLE/141219589/AR/0/AR-141219589.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2014-12-14T14:25:55Z-04", "modified_time": "2014-12-15T09:09:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcffbd\"", "article_summary": "Seven in 10 social media users said they would take some kind of action, including sharing the post, in response to a friend posting a story on social media about making a charitable donation.\nMost large nonprofits rely on regular contributions from businesses and corporations, and social media donors typically are individuals.\nThe ALS Association, which supports a cure for Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease, turned a few non-profit heads this year when a fundraising effort exploded across social media.\n\u201cSocial media has replaced traditional email as a desired form of receiving communications, so we let donors know how their donation made an impact through social media instead of just email or mail.\u201dkmorelli@tampatrib.com(813) 259-7760\nSocial media increasingly is a way to connect with those individuals."}
