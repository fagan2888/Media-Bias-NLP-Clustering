The death of a student-athlete has shaken the Canadian County town of Union City. Friends and family are remembering 8th grader Preston Williams, who was killed in a car crash Friday.

On Sunday, a candlelight vigil was held at the Union City baseball diamond, where Preston spent a lot of time. Second base is now painted neon -- Preston's favorite color.

"It's definitely hard," teacher Emily Hogland said. "The whole community really had to come together. Friday was definitely a rough time."

Preston was killed in a single-car wreck near Highway 152 Friday. Money is now being collected throughout Union City to help the boy's family pay for funeral expenses. As the sun set in Union City Sunday, candles were lit and prayers were sent all for a boy whose life was cut much too short.

"[He was] really a joy to have in class and all the other kids loved him," said Hogland.

For such a small town, such a large crowd shows just how much Preston is loved. On Tuesday, students and staff say they will be wearing neon at school in Preston's honor. For information on a fundraiser supporting the Williams family, call Tammi Gravitt at 405-483-5263 or email tgravitt31@tds.net.
