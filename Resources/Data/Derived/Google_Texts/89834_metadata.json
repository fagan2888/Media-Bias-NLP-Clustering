Pat McCrory recently announced increasing teacher pay as part of his 2014 agenda, vowing to push the issue during the upcoming legislative session. Pay raises have already been authorized for employees in high-demand professions such as medicine, accounting, auditing and information technology. About 1,200 nurses and 600 law enforcement employees will receive increases ranging from 4 to 10 percent.\n\n\u201cTeachers in North Carolina had one raise in the last five or six years, and that is unacceptable to me, and unacceptable to the Legislature and unacceptable to the people of North Carolina,\u201d McCrory said.\n\nEducation professionals have taken a \u201cwait and see\u201d approach to McCrory\u2019s promise.\n\n\u201cTeachers remain skeptical about how we\u2019re going to get there, when we\u2019re going to get there and what it will look like,\u201d said Rodney Ellis, president of the North Carolina Association of Educators during a recent appearance on WRAL\u2019s On the Record. \u201cWe\u2019re anxious to see what the governor has in mind.\u201d\n\nTeacher pay\n\nTeacher pay has been a hot issue in recent years and was highlighted during a number of protests last year. Thousands of teachers sporting red shirts traveled from across the state to Raleigh in July for one of the weekly \u201cMoral Monday\u201d protests. Their presence created one of the largest such protests of the year as educators rallied for increased teacher pay among other educational topics.\n\nMelissa Russell-Ausley didn\u2019t attend that rally but the Johnston County high school teacher wore red in support.\n\n\u201cIt is alarming and shameful the number of teachers whose children are on free and reduced lunch,\u201d she said.\n\nRussell-Ausley isn\u2019t surprised by the Virginia recruiting effort.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re poaching the best and brightest of our talent, and right now it\u2019s prime picking because they know we\u2019re unhappy,\u201d she said.\n\nState education leaders have cited pay as a reason why teachers are either working in other states or leaving the profession. North Carolina\u2019s teacher turnover rate was 14.33 percent in 2012-13, an increase from 12.13 percent in 2011-12, according to a North Carolina Department of Public Instruction report.\n\n\"The statistics that trouble me are the hundreds of educators who left their jobs in 2012-13 to teach in another state or resigned because they were dissatisfied with teaching or wanted a career change,\u201d state Superintendent June Atkinson said in December. \u201cI am concerned that if changes are not made, low pay and a lack of support will push even more educators out of North Carolina classrooms and the teaching profession.\"\n\nNorth Carolina teacher salaries ranked 49th in the nation in 2011-12 with an average pay of $45,947, according to the National Education Association. Virginia ranked 31st with an average pay of $50,574.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s very strategic and very targeted,\u201d said Mark Jewell, NCAE vice-president, of the ads.\n\nA similar ad lured Jewell to North Carolina nearly 17 years ago.\n\n\u201cBottom line, teachers do have to pay their bills,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30;polling-uri=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=1;polling-uri2=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=2;polling-uri3=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=3;polling-uri4=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=4;polling-uri5=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=5;cycle=1", "dcterms.created": "2014-01-26 16:10:00", "description": "The Western Virginia Public Education Consortium has placed classified ads in community newspaper across the state advertising an upcoming teacher fair.
