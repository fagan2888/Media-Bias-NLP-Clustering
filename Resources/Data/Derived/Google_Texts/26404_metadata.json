The company plans to use the new their latest round of funding to bolster their products and services, and expand their team.\n\nLed by their existing investor Sequoia, they are joined by Matrix Partners, True Ventures, and Greenspring Associates. In addition to the new venture funding, Namely is expanding to Austin, Texas where they will house a new sales team. The company already has a presence in both New York and San Francisco.\n\nNamely is an HR platform that allows companies to have an external HR team, manage payroll, offer benefits, and manage candidates. The company currently processes more than $2.5 billion in annual payroll for their clients, which are mid-market sized organizations. In the past year Namely reportedly doubled their client roster, and improved their core technology to align with increasingly strict compliance rules and regulations.\n\n\u201cThe amount of regulatory complexity facing HR has grown tremendously in the last year, and we expect that trend to continue in 2016,\u201d said Namely Founder and CEO Matt Straz. \u201cAt Namely, we make it much easier for HR leaders to manage compliance, so they can spend their time on strategy, engagement, and developing people\u2014the things they love to do.\u201d\n\nThe Affordable Care Act continues to affect regulations across the board, which is where organizations like Namely shine. On top of their platform, they also focus heavily on compliance changes.\n\n\u201cNamely frees people from the shackles of back-office HR administration and enables them to become strategic drivers of employee culture and engagement, which are the foundation on which great companies are built,\u201d said Sequoia Partner Pat Grady. \u201cNamely\u2019s growth is a reflection of its maniacal focus on customer success. We\u2019re thrilled to deepen our commitment to Namely, and to support the team in taking HR into the 21st century.\u201d\n\nTo date, Namely has raised a total of $107.8 million in outside funding. Their latest round closed last June and was also led by Sequoia.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nLinkedIn\n\nReddit\n\nGoogle\n\nTumblr\n\nEmail\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "New York based Namely has announced the successful raise of $30M.
