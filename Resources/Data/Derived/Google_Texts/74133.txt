Owensboro leaders are facing a substantial budget deficit. City officials say a property tax raise will be needed to help cover a $1.6 million deficit.

City Manager Bill Parrish says Owensboro has to keep its financial house in order, and be aggressive in finding new revenues, and that could include higher property taxes.

"We're on solid ground, but we have to be cautious for the future," he says.

The future for Owenbsoro home owners could include an increase of 21 cents a month per $100,000 value in their houses, a total of $2.52 a year. Rates haven't gone up in nearly seven years.

"Sounds like a reasonable amount," says Paul Dornburg of Owenbsoro.

"Some people in Owensboro I know live on a limited budget income, so that may be harder for those people, but people still in the work force, probably can handle that," adds Mark Mattingly of Owensboro.

Parrish says it comes as costs are estimated to go from nearly $48 million to more than $54 million by 2020, but revenues only increasing by more $2 million.

"Our health care costs are up $340,000 this year. $340,000. Most of that is attributed to the Affordable Care Act. Whether you like it or don't like it, it came from that. We've got to pay that," says Parrish.

Parrish also says the rate increase would add more than $300,000 a year. State law limits them from having property tax revenue grow more than 4%.

"Every year in September, after the budget brief, the city commission has declined to take that budget brief. So every year, there's a hole in the budget of over $300,000 when we start the fiscal year because the property tax increase wasn't there," says Parrish.

Parrish adds the budget deficit has no effect on the icemen's move to owensboro for the 2017-18 season, adding removing the Sportscenter from its budget gets them out of a significant deficit.

City commissioners won't be voting on a proposed property tax increase until September.
