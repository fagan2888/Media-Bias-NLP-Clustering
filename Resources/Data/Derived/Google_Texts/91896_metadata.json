Shawn Glans of the Saratoga County sheriff\u2019s department.\n\nAs the Daily Gazette noted, Glans has wrought violence on civilians before: In 1996, he lost control of his squad car while driving three times the speed limit, slamming into 45-year-old Douglas McEachron.\n\nMcEachron was paralyzed in the crash, and the Albany Times Union reported that in the ensuing court battle, Glans was found to be negligent and McEachron was awarded $6 million \u2014 which Saratoga County, not Glans himself, had to pay.\n\nWhile the Saratoga County sheriff did not identify Glans as the officer in the Friday video \u2014 the investigation is an internal matter for now \u2014 he did condemn the deputy\u2019s action.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m kind of very disturbed with what I saw in the video,\u201d Sheriff Michael Zurlo said in a statement. \u201cI\u2019m not going to condone this type of activity as the video portrayed. I\u2019m going to look into this and I\u2019m going to act accordingly \u2014 quickly and swiftly \u2014 with regards to this.\u201d\n\nThe deputy has been suspended without pay as the investigation proceeds, the Daily Gazette reported.\n\nUPDATE: The Albany Times Union got in touch with Glans.\n\nThe deputy said he would have done the same thing over again, unless he knew he was being filmed.\n\n\u201cYou saw the video. It doesn\u2019t look good,\u201d Glans told the Times Union. \u201cI\u2019m all about doing the right thing. I had to go to that point because of the factors that came into play. There was a gun that was involved (that) I spotted in the vehicle.\u201d\n\nGlans said he didn\u2019t know he was being recorded.\n\n\u201cI was concerned. It was a public safety issue,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I had to do it all over again \u2026 I\u2019d probably do the same thing. If I knew the camera was there, no, because it does look bad.\u201d\n\n\u2014\n\nFollow Zach Noble (@thezachnoble) on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "gplus-count": 19, "twitter": {"description": "Curses, a slap and threats of deadly violence \u2014 that's what a police officer was caught on camera doing to an apparently innocent man.
