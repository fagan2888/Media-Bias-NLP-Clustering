In 2012 Gallup had predicted a narrow Mitt Romney win, instead of the comfortable Barack Obama victory that was actually achieved, but a serious post-mortem seemingly ensured it would continue its long tradition, dating back to 1936, of polling presidential races.\n\nLess than a month later, on Nov. 4, the Louisville Courier-Journal and Lexington Herald-Leader announced major changes after their pollster, SurveyUSA, missed Matt Bevin\u2019s surprisingly strong win in the Kentucky governor\u2019s race. SUSA was hardly alone in getting the outcome wrong, however \u2014 as shown by the polling trend averages at both Huffington Post and Real Clear Politics. But it did not help that the poll also found Mitch McConnell in a much closer race for his Senate seat in 2014, and he rolled to re-election over Alison Lundergan Grimes.\n\n\u201cIt feels like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu all over again,\u201d Harry Enten wrote at Five Thirty Eight, linking back to a Nate Silver live update as last May\u2019s British election results showed pre-election polls had been far off. \u201cThe World May Have A Polling Problem,\u201d Silver\u2019s update was titled, pointing to the Scottish independence vote, the Israeli legislative election, David Cameron\u2019s relative landslide and last year\u2019s U.S. midterms. \u201cIt\u2019s become harder to find an election in which the polls did all that well,\u201d Silver wrote at the time.\n\nAs recently as August 2014, Silver had written about the problems facing pollsters, primarily driven by falling response rates (down from 36 percent in 1997 to 9 percent today, according to Pew Research), but still could say, \u201cWe have seen no widespread decline in the accuracy of election polls, at least not yet.\u201d Fifteen months later, that no longer seems to be true.\n\nEven when Silver wrote, there was Gallup\u2019s black eye to consider, but Gallup had been an outlier. Most pollsters correctly predicted Obama\u2019s victory, though they did under-estimate it overall. Now, the difficulties have become more widespread, as if the problems driven by falling response rates have finally reached a tipping point. In the case of Kentucky, Huffington Pollster\u2019s weekly roundup pointed to a number of factors:\n\nAlthough it\u2019s difficult to know for sure, evidence points to the timing of the polls, the partisan composition of likely voters in the polls and the presence of an independent candidate. None of these alone explains the wide discrepancy between the polls and the result, but combined, they contributed to the miss.\n\nIt went on to add the sparsity of polling as well: \u201conly six publicly released polls between August and Election Day.\u201d\n\nThe proliferation of these problems points to an even broader phenomena than the falling response rate \u2014 an ongoing dissolution of political trust, coherence and order. Low-turnout elections in and of themselves reflect such a general democratic decay, while third-party candidates tend to signal systemic problem-solving failures and voter disaffection. Pollster Charles Franklin also highlighted how pollsters matched party registration, but not identification \u2014 a divergence that further underscores the process of dissolution.\n\nOver on center stage, in the GOP presidential primary, there are a multitude of other ways in which this dissolution plays out, starting with the deep distrust of the political establishment reflected in the success of Donald Trump and Ben Carson, but also extending to the difficulties of polling \u2014 much less covering \u2014 such an enormous primary field. The RNC\u2019s decision to let media hosts set the criteria, coupled with media decisions to use national poll aggregates and a two-tier debate format, actually empowers some of the worst fragmenting potentials that public polling can have.\n\nBut what about their potential for good?\n\nPolling And Deliberation\n\nBack in 2004, Gallup\u2019s Newport published a strong defense of what Gallup then did, \u201cThe Pluses of Pre-Election Horse Race Polls.\u201d In it, he took note of Stanford professor James Fishkin and his advocacy of deliberative polling, centered on \u201cdeliberative forums in which citizens meet and talk in a modern-day town-hall setting, based on his belief that citizens involved in such discussions might arrive at better, more informed decisions\u201d \u2014 only to quickly dismiss him.\n\n\u201cBut just how much does this in-person deliberating differ from the broader input from friends and neighbors provided by polls? I think not much,\u201d Newport wrote. \u201cPolls, in fact, are in many ways an extension of a town-hall, deliberative process. Polling simply distills the opinions of all of one\u2019s neighbors (across the state or across the nation) in an accurate fashion \u2014 an expanded version of what the voter would find out by asking neighbors in the community where they stand on the issues of the day.\u201d\n\nThis carelessly overlooks the very essence of the deliberative process \u2014 considering different alternatives in light of different information, and discussing the various pluses and minuses that emerge. Nothing remotely like this happens in the course of most horse race polling. But Gallup\u2019s more recent decision to refocus on \u201cunderstanding the issues and priorities\u201d could potentially signal a move in that direction, a strategy for responding to the dissolution described above by finding another footing for the deliberative process. It\u2019s clearly a reactive response to the most obvious symptoms \u2014 problems with predicting the horse race outcome \u2014 but if Gallup is really serious, then it needs to go much farther, and confront some deeper problems.\n\nFor one thing, issues and priorities are not at all similar for all potential voters. As I noted here in late September, Philip Converse presented evidence in 1964 that \u201cThose with low political knowledge have little to organize their political views. They respond mostly to the ephemeral nature of the times. Then, as voters become more knowledgeable, groups become very salient, to be replaced by ideological thinking among only the most informed.\u201d\n\nThis is not to say that public opinion is meaningless, or that public deliberation is impossible \u2014 but it is tricky. You can\u2019t just assume that everyone responds to political questions in similar ways, which can produce coherent deliberation. They don\u2019t. This is also a significant problem with with Fishkin\u2019s approach. As described on his web site, the process begins with polling a random representative sample of the public, just like a normal poll, but then moves into a phase where participants are recruited for an in-person deliberative process. This process is extremely unlikely to engage the sorts of low-information citizens Converse identified as making up a substantial portion of the electorate. So how truly representative can it actually be?\n\nThe Public Interest Polling Model\n\nFortunately, another pollster has taken important steps in the direction of showing how deliberation can be made possible, without asking anyone to do much more than an ordinary poll would. In 1986, shortly before Fishkin began his work, Alan F. Kay launched his model of \u201cpublic interest polling.\u201d The Americans Talk Issues Foundation\u2019s series of more than 30 polls continued over the next decade and a half.\n\nAs Kay explained the concept in 1999, \u201cPublic-interest polling is about issues \u2014 resolving community, regional, state, national and international problems. What is needed is governance that will help make the world, or our part of it, work with consensus support as easily realizable as a small town-meeting can find a consensus should it wish to.\u201d Although it doesn\u2019t engage participants in back-and-forth discussions with one another, it does include methods for exposing people to different arguments and discovering if they significantly change people\u2019s views. And it doesn\u2019t require any higher levels of political sophistication or commitment. Like the jury system, it\u2019s open to one and all.\n\n\u201cPublic-interest polling requires a healthy mixture of common sense and the knowledge of experts,\u201d Kay wrote. \u201cQuestions must be fair,\u201d they should not \u201clead the witness,\u201d as lawyers would say. \u201cQuestion-sets (not necessarily every question) should be balanced. The survey design team, consisting of polling and issue experts, should collectively represent a wide range of backgrounds and points of view.\u201d And they should be willing to work through any confusions that arise, using \u201cfollow-on questions,\u201d or split samples to pose slightly different versions for comparison, as well as serial surveys.\n\n\u201cOnce you\u2019ve gotten the hang of it, you can clear up all the ambiguities in one or two additional surveys,\u201d Kay writes. \u201cIn 33 surveys, over and over again, it worked every time for my company, ATI, from 1987 to 1999.\u201d Kay\u2019s findings are collected in his book, Locating Consensus for Democracy \u2013 A Ten-Year U.S. Experiment.\n\nPerhaps what\u2019s most striking about Kay\u2019s approach is the way he has surfaced consensus positions on a wide range of issues that most pollsters never even ask about and that few political elites ever consider. The unexpected consensus revealed should not be surprising, given the findings reported by Martin Gilens and Benjamin Page about the powerlessness of the general public. Based on a data set covering 1,779 policy issues, they reported:\n\nMultivariate analysis indicates that economic elites and organized groups representing business interests have substantial independent impacts on U.S. government policy, while average citizens and mass-based interest groups have little or no independent influence.\n\nIn this situation, all manner of popular policies are simply ignored, unless they happen to coincide with what some powerful interest group also wants.\n\nKay\u2019s results also call to mind the \u201cBig Ideas\u201d poll commissioned by the Progressive Change Institute in January, which I wrote about last summer. \u201cPCI first solicited ideas online through an open submission process (more than 2,600 specific proposals were submitted) and then let people vote on them (more than a million votes were cast),\u201d I explained. \u201cThis bottom-up process was then tested out in a national poll.\u201d\n\nIt was a very different sort of process than Kay\u2019s but, like his approach, it tapped into neglected sources of strong public consensus. Ideas receiving 70 percent support or more included:\n\nAllow Government to Negotiate Drug Prices (79 percent)\n\nGive Students the Same Low Interest Rates as Big Banks (78 percent)\n\nUniversal Pre-Kindergarten (77 percent)\n\nFair Trade that Protect Workers, the Environment, and Jobs (75 percent)\n\nEnd Tax Loopholes for Corporations that Ship Jobs Overseas (74 percent)\n\nEnd Gerrymandering (73 percent)\n\nLet Homeowners Pay Down Mortgage With 401k (72 percent)\n\nDebt-Free College at All Public Universities (Message A) (71 percent)\n\nInfrastructure Jobs Program \u2014 $400 Billion / Year (71 percent)\n\nRequire NSA to Get Warrants (71 percent)\n\nDisclose Corporate Spending on Politics/Lobbying (71 percent)\n\nMedicare Buy-In for All (71 percent)\n\nClose Offshore Corporate Tax Loopholes (70 percent)\n\nGreen New Deal \u2014 Millions Of Clean-Energy Jobs (70percent)\n\nFull Employment Act (70 percent)\n\nExpand Social Security Benefits (70 percent)\n\nHowever, these ideas were all developed from a self-selected progressive base, and were not subject to winnowing through exposure to counter-arguments. What\u2019s fascinating about Kay\u2019s approach is that it also produced robustly popular proposals that political elites rarely considered, and the greater diversity among them has important lessons for us today, several decades after they were first uncovered.\n\nKay also wrote that ATI found \u201coverwhelming evidence that the legislation and policy choices most supported by Americans are characterized by four key adjectives: stable, consistent, pragmatic and principled.\u201d They vary only slowly over time, except in response to some major event; levels of support vary only slightly when questions are presented in different ways; solutions are pragmatic, rather than ideological, often encompassing \u201cother dimensions\u201d that aren\u2019t addressed by different party proposals and \u201cthey want solutions that are good for everybody and comprehensive,\u201d rather than simply doing what\u2019s best for themselves alone.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The polls are revolting.
