That is an improvement of 2 percentage points from 2013 and the first time the number has dipped below 1 million in the past five years, Stringer said.\n\nWEB EXTRA: View The Data\n\nStringer noted that neighborhoods with large immigrant and younger populations \u2014 such as Sunnyside, Jackson Heights and Corona in Queens and Bushwich in Brooklyn \u2014 saw much higher rates, with more than 22 percent of residents lacking coverage.\n\n\u201cClose to a million New Yorkers do not have the basic health care coverage that they\u2019re entitled to have,\u201d Stringer told 1010 WINS. \u201cObamacare is for everyone.\u201d\n\nThe report was issued to coincide with the Affordable Care Act open enrollment period, which runs from Nov. 1 to Dec. 15 for coverage beginning Jan. 1.\n\n\u201cBeing uninsured can have real economic and health consequences for you and your family,\u201d Stringer said. \u201cSo my message today is this: The open enrollment period for Obamacare has just begun. We have just a few weeks to get moving, find these New Yorkers and get them signed up for health insurance. Now is the time to take action.\u201d\n\nThe state health care exchange can be accessed at nystateofhealth.ny.gov.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Stringer noted that neighborhoods with large immigrant and younger populations saw much higher rates, with more than 22 percent of residents lacking coverage.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2015/11/09/comptroller-scott-stringer-health-insurance/", "image": {"width": 625, "secure_url": "https://cbsnewyork.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/health.jpg?w=625", "identifier": "https://cbsnewyork.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/health.jpg?w=625", "height": 352}, "type": "article", "description": "Stringer noted that neighborhoods with large immigrant and younger populations saw much higher rates, with more than 22 percent of residents lacking coverage.", "title": "Comptroller: Nearly 1 Million New Yorkers Lack Health Insurance"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://cbsnewyork.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/health.jpg?w=625", "description": "Stringer noted that neighborhoods with large immigrant and younger populations saw much higher rates, with more than 22 percent of residents lacking coverage.", "site": "/CBSnewyork", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Comptroller: Nearly 1 Million New Yorkers Lack Health Insurance"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Breaking News, Sports, Weather, Traffic And The Best of NY", "fb": {"app_id": 148100721870411}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://newyork.cbslocal.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/50e3ae7b1a37ec6f5f022661f15b5473?s=16", "application-name": "CBS New York", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/CBSNewYork", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/CBSNewYork"}, "keywords": "new york city, comptroller scott stringer, health care insurance, analysis, report, affordable care act, obamacare", "google-site-verification": "44caXBf4kjHeKKAT7ZZ89NaCX25utL_yRSa-qGpwIhY", "bitly-verification": "98ab9c1eda26", "news_keywords": "affordable care act, health care, health insurance, obamacare, scott stringer"}, "article_summary": "The comptroller released an analysis that found that more than 962,000 New Yorkers, or 11.4 percent of the population, lack health insurance.\nWe have just a few weeks to get moving, find these New Yorkers and get them signed up for health insurance.\nNow is the time to take action.\u201dThe state health care exchange can be accessed at nystateofhealth.ny.gov.\n\u201cClose to a million New Yorkers do not have the basic health care coverage that they\u2019re entitled to have,\u201d Stringer told 1010 WINS.\nNEW YORK (CBSNewYork) \u2014 The Affordable Care Act has helped more New Yorkers gain access to health care, but still more than one in 10 residents are not insured, city Comptroller Scott Stringer said Monday."}
