Mitt Romney and his vice presidential running mate, Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., get ready to order as they make an unscheduled stop at a Wendy's restaurant in Richmond Heights, Ohio, on Election Day, Tuesday, Nov. 6, 2012.\n\nRepublicans have consistently claimed that President Obama\u2019s policies will kill jobs. Today, the Department of Labor announced that 271,000 jobs had been created. Overall, there have been 68 straight months of job growth creating 13.5 million new jobs. It is the longest streak of job growth on record in American history.\n\nHere are some predictions Republicans made that are pretty embarrassing in light of the new data.\n\n1. Obamacare will \u201cdestroy our economy\u2026 It\u2019s going to push us into a total economic collapse.\u201d\n\nThese are the words of Rep. Paul Broun (R-GA), in 2013, just before the official start of the health care exchanges.\n\nThe notion that Obamacare is a job-killer has become a rallying for Republicans from the moment it became law. In 2011, former Speaker John Boehner predicted that Obamacare \u201cwill bankrupt our nation, and it will ruin our economy\u201d during a press conference where he used the phrase \u201cjob-killing\u201d once every two minutes.\n\nThe entire Republican leadership in the House, including current Speaker Paul Ryan, signed onto this report:\n\nOn Twitter, columnist Dan Diamond charted the trend:\n\n\n\nObamacare was signed into law in March 2010.

Wall Street reform is \u201ca symbol of government overreach that is killing jobs.\u201d\n\nOn the campaign trail in 2011, Mitt Romney and other top Republicans blasted Dodd-Frank, a Wall Street reform bill signed by Obama, as \u201ca symbol of government overreach that is killing jobs.\u201d The legislation was signed into law in July 2010.\n\nRepublicans say Dodd-Frank is the root of some of today\u2019s economic problems. It has stopped banks from lending to \u201cjob creators,\u201d they contend, and is a direct cause of high unemployment. \u201cIt created such uncertainty that the bankers, instead of making loans, pulled back,\u201d said Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor, speaking at a South Carolina rally over Labor Day weekend where he again called for the law\u2019s repeal.\n\nOther candidates who called for the immediate repeal of Dodd-Frank, blaming it for high unemployment, include Rick Perry, Newt Gingrich and Michele Bachmann.\n\n3. \u201cBurdensome and ineffective\u201d EPA regulations are \u201ccreating barriers for needed capital investment and job growth.\u201d\n\nIn his 2012 budget, Rep. Paul Ryan wrote that the EPA\u2019s \u201c[b]urdensome and ineffective regulations on businesses in the service of dubious environmental goals have driven up the prices of many products and services, while creating barriers for needed capital investment and job creation.\u201d\n\nThe inflation rate in 2015 is near zero.\n\nRyan\u2019s running mate in 2012, Mitt Romney, blasted the \u201cthe job-crushing over-regulation of the EPA.\u201d\n\n4. The 2009 stimulus bill is \u201caffirmatively job killing\u201d and \u201cabout to get worse.\u201d\n\nFormer House Speaker Newt Gingrich, also a candidate for President in 2012, blasted the 2009 stimulus bill \u2014 a package designed to save the American economy when it was losing 750,000 jobs per month \u2014 as an example of \u201cthe Obama administration\u2019s job-killing policies [that] are hurting America.\u201d\n\nRomney described the stimulus as a \u201cbill that gave us Solyndra but left us with record unemployment.\u201d\n\nThe White House estimated that the stimulus \u201csaved or created an average of 1.6 million jobs a year for four years through the end of 2012.\u201d\n\n****\n\nMitt Romney claimed that by rolling back these policies \u2014 repealing Obamacare, replacing Dodd-Frank, reining in the EPA, cutting government spending \u2014 he could reduce unemployment to 6 percent by January 2017.\n\nThe unemployment rate currently stands at 5 percent.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "We're in the middle of the longest streak of job growth on record in American history.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "We're in the middle of the longest streak of job growth on record in American history.", "title": "4 Predictions Republicans Made About The Economy That Are Really Embarrassing Now", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2015/11/06/3719972/jobs-republicans-embarrassing-predictions/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/06103328/AP_258013998599-600x315.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "We're in the middle of the longest streak of job growth on record in American history.", "creator": "@JuddLegum", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/06103328/AP_258013998599-321x214.jpg", "title": "4 Predictions Republicans Made About The Economy That Are Really Embarrassing Now", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-economy", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/06103328/AP_258013998599-540x303.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/06103328/AP_258013998599-99x66.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-06T10:48:23+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/juddcooperlegum"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Economy 4 Predictions Republicans Made About The Economy That Are Really Embarrassing Now CREDIT: AP Photo/Charles Dharapak Republican presidential candidate, former Massachusetts Gov.\nHere are some predictions Republicans made that are pretty embarrassing in light of the new data.\nThe notion that Obamacare is a job-killer has become a rallying for Republicans from the moment it became law.\nRepublicans have consistently claimed that President Obama\u2019s policies will kill jobs.\nIt has stopped banks from lending to \u201cjob creators,\u201d they contend, and is a direct cause of high unemployment."}
