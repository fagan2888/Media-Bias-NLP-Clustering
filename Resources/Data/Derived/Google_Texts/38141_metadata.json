Rick Perry on two felony counts, he and United States Sen. Ted Cruz were in friendlier territory, speaking at a conference hosted by a conservative blog here in the largest reliably Republican community in Texas.\n\nMr. Perry walked onto the stage of the RedState Gathering to warm applause, his regard among conservative activists having been bolstered by his recent activity related to the border, particularly his decision to send National Guard troops there in response to an influx of migrants.\n\n\u201cIf Washington won\u2019t act to secure the border, as governor of Texas, I will,\u201d Mr. Perry said.\n\nEight hours later, Senator Ted Cruz walked into the same hotel ballroom, greeted with the kind of rapturous cheers fitting a military commander returning home from a combat victory.\n\n\u201cThe grass roots are winning fight after fight after fight,\u201d Mr. Cruz said, adding later, \u201cI believe we have laid the foundation for winning the war to repeal Obamacare.\u201d\n\nMr. Perry\u2019s presidential ambitions have since been overshadowed by the news Friday of his indictment related to a 2013 veto of funding for the state\u2019s anti-corruption prosecutors. Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, who oversees the public integrity unit, refused Mr. Perry\u2019s calls to resign after she pleaded guilty to drunken driving, prompting the governor\u2019s veto.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Perry was indicted on counts of abuse of official capacity and coercion of a public servant. His office has said he has only acted within his authority as governor, and Mr. Cruz called the indictment politically motivated.\n\nEven before his recent legal troubles, Mr. Perry was already operating in Mr. Cruz\u2019s shadow, as most conservative activists in attendance made clear they would rather see the freshman senator vie for the White House in two years than the three-term governor.\n\n\u201cWhen I look at you, I imagine you would be just like one of the founding fathers of this country,\u201d a female attendee told Mr. Cruz after his speech.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe dynamic underscored a growing tension in Texas politics. As the state\u2019s two highest-profile Republicans are contemplating bids for the White House, Mr. Cruz and Mr. Perry are at the start of a period where they are likely to be constantly jockeying for favor among the same audiences.\n\nThe legal troubles that have surfaced for Mr. Perry could scuttle his hopes of running again for president before they gain traction.\n\n\u201cThis will \u2014 depending on how it plays out and how long it lasts \u2014 will certainly be detrimental to that nascent campaign for the presidential nomination in 2016,\u201d said Cal Jillson, a political-science professor at Southern Methodist University said. (S.M.U. is a corporate sponsor of The Texas Tribune.)\n\nWhile Mr. Cruz is vying for the favor of Tea Party voters, Mr. Perry could still be a powerful draw to a segment of conservatives more interested in a candidate with executive experience, Mr. Jillson said.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going as an experienced executive, governor of the second largest state in the country with an economic success story to tell,\u201d Mr. Jillson said. \u201cAnd the immigration issue brings him to attention among conservatives.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn Mr. Cruz\u2019s speech, he promoted recent conservative victories in Washington, including the Democrats\u2019 failure to pass gun control legislation after the mass shooting at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn., as signs of a shift in the relationship between grass-roots conservatives and elected officials.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m convinced the biggest divide we\u2019ve got in politics in this country is not between Republicans and Democrats,\u201d Mr. Cruz said. \u201cIt is between entrenched politicians in both parties and the American people.\u201d\n\nMr. Perry\u2019s speech was reminiscent of ones he gave during his 2012 bid for president in the way it focused on the robust Texas economy, and his belief that the federal government should follow the lead of Texas and other conservative states by lowering taxes and balancing budgets.\n\n\u201cYou all know I brag a lot about Texas,\u201d Mr. Perry said. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of been part of my job description for the last 13-plus years. But frankly, we have a lot to be proud of.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nBob Guzzardi, a conservative activist from Ardmore, Pa., told Mr. Perry after his speech that he hoped a man with his message would run for president. Asked about it a day later, Mr. Guzzardi stopped short of saying he would support Mr. Perry in a second presidential run.\n\n\u201cI liked the emphasis of what he is talking about, but frankly, I\u2019m more of a Ted Cruz guy,\u201d Mr. Guzzardi said.\n\nKathleen Wazny of Denton echoed a similar sentiment, praising Mr. Perry\u2019s record and noticing an improvement in his delivery from his first presidential run. Yet there was no question whom she hopes to support in 2016.\n\n\u201cCruz has been in Washington, and he\u2019s seen the petty politics there,\u201d Ms. Wazny said. \u201cRunning the chessboard in Washington is very different from running the chessboard in Austin.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe enthusiasm gap even extended to Erick Erickson, editor in chief of RedState.com and the conference M.C., who seemed to favor Mr. Cruz in his introductions. While he praised Mr. Perry as \u201ca man who, while the president is at the golf course, is leading the nation at the border,\u201d he compared the excitement around Mr. Cruz to that of the Beatles and introduced him as \u201cthe leader of the conservative movement in the United States of America.\u201d\n\nAs Jeff Tucker of Round Rock and Michael Pemberton of Radcliff, Ky., poured themselves cups of coffee ahead of another day of RedState panel discussions and speeches, they compared impressions of the day before. Mr. Pemberton described Mr. Perry as more passionate but said that Mr. Cruz\u2019s arguments were sharper.\n\n\u201cI think of the two of them, together, they make one great politician,\u201d Mr. Pemberton said.\n\nHe then wondered aloud: Could the two Texas leaders possibly run on the same ticket?\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve thought a lot about that,\u201d Mr. Tucker admitted.\n\nBut who should be at the top of the ticket?\n\nThe two men considered the question for a moment. \u201cProbably Ted Cruz,\u201d Mr. Tucker said, his friend nodding in agreement. \u201cHe fights those guys. He doesn\u2019t back down.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140816113150, "twitter": {"description": "Gov.
