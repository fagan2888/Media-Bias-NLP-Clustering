This isn\u2019t real, is it?\n\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency is making it tougher for governors to deny man-made climate change. Starting next year, the agency will approve disaster-preparedness funds only for states whose governors approve hazard-mitigation plans that address climate change\u2026 The policy doesn\u2019t affect federal money for relief after a hurricane, flood, or other disaster. Specifically, beginning in March 2016, states seeking preparedness money will have to assess how climate change threatens their communities. Governors will have to sign off on hazard-mitigation plans. While some states, including New York, have already started incorporating climate risks in their plans, most haven\u2019t because FEMA\u2019s 2008 guidelines didn\u2019t require it\u2026 Among those who could face a difficult decision are New Jersey\u2019s Gov. Christie and fellow Republican Govs. Rick Scott of Florida, Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, Greg Abbott of Texas, and Pat McCrory of North Carolina \u2013 all of whom have denied man-made climate change or refused to take action. The states they lead face immediate threats from climate change.\n\nSo, good news \u2014 if your state gets leveled by an earthquake, you get help from the feds after everything\u2019s been reduced to rubble. What you don\u2019t get is help beforehand to mitigate the effects of earthquakes unless you\u2019re willing to swear your oath of allegiance to the warmist cause. The biggest recipient of preparedness funds is Louisiana, so if a new hurricane ends up killing a few hundred people there, we\u2019re all set for the mother of all blame games between Obama on the one hand and the state government on the other over whose fault it is that Louisiana didn\u2019t get the money it needed up front to save lives. Bobby Jindal will play this to the hilt in the GOP primaries, using it as evidence of how he refuses to bow to Obama\u2019s agenda even when big bucks are on the line.\n\n\u201cThis story really brings together all the elements of Obamaism,\u201d tweets Dan McLaughlin. which is true. It\u2019s legally dubious; it ignores Congress, which might constitutionally have the power to let FEMA make this judgment but hasn\u2019t been consulted; it\u2019s an obvious political pander to the left with a bonus of putting right-wingers in a spot, even at the expense of placing citizens at risk; and it craps all over state autonomy. Basically, it\u2019s the environmental equivalent of executive amnesty. All that\u2019s missing is 18-24 months of Obama statements denying that he\u2019d ever do something like this before turning around and doing it.\n\nJindal\u2019s sure to give FEMA a middle finger on it but I wonder what Chris Christie will do. He\u2019s got to resist too, right? Jerseyans will hate him for it, but they already hate him and he doesn\u2019t much care what they think anymore. Besides, he\u2019s already started to get right with national primary voters on the issue. The next time he yells at someone for not giving New Jersey the FEMA money it needs, bet that he\u2019ll be yelling at the White House, not House Republicans.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "\u201cThis could potentially become a major conflict for several Republican governors.\u201d", "title": "Report: FEMA to withhold disaster-preparedness funds from states that don\u2019t plan for climate change", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2015/03/23/report-fema-to-withhold-disaster-preparedness-funds-from-states-that-dont-plan-for-climate-change/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@allahpundit"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "keywords": "climate change, disaster preparedness, Federal Emergency Management Agency, global warming,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-23T20:41:16+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-23T20:13:13+00:00"}, "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0866\"", "article_summary": "Report: FEMA to withhold disaster-preparedness funds from states that don\u2019t plan for climate changeposted at 4:41 pm on March 23, 2015 by AllahpunditC\u2019mon.\nSpecifically, beginning in March 2016, states seeking preparedness money will have to assess how climate change threatens their communities.\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency is making it tougher for governors to deny man-made climate change.\nThe states they lead face immediate threats from climate change.\nThe next time he yells at someone for not giving New Jersey the FEMA money it needs, bet that he\u2019ll be yelling at the White House, not House Republicans."}
