Denver (and other counties) will mail out ballots the week of Oct. 14 for the Nov. 4 election, and in-person voter service and polling centers begin opening Oct. 20.\n\n\u201cThe DenverVotes app will put a variety of useful information right at the voter\u2019s fingertips,\u201d Denver Clerk and Recorder Debra Johnson said in a news release.\n\nPotential voters can register using the new app if they have a Colorado driver\u2019s license. Or registered voters can check their current listing. Division spokesman Alton Dillard urged voters to check to make sure their address is up to date now to ensure they get their ballots.\n\nAccording to the app, as of Friday, Denver had 466,390 registered voters, nearly 343,000 of them active. The split in affiliations among active voters: 48 percent Democratic, 16 percent Republican and 35 percent unaffiliated.\n\nJon Murray: 303-954-1405, jmurray@denverpost.com or twitter.com/JonMurray", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "New app allows Denver voters to register, see info on smart phones", "title": "New app allows Denver voters to register, see info on smart phones", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/09/08/new-app-allows-denver-voters-to-register-see-info-on-smart-phones/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-08T16:48:33+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-08T16:48:33+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The split in affiliations among active voters: 48 percent Democratic, 16 percent Republican and 35 percent unaffiliated.\nAccording to the app, as of Friday, Denver had 466,390 registered voters, nearly 343,000 of them active.\nThe app \u2014 called \u201cDenver Votes!\u201d \u2014 is available on the Android and Apple app stores.\nOr registered voters can check their current listing.\nPotential voters can register using the new app if they have a Colorado driver\u2019s license."}
