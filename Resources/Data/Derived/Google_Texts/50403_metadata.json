Susan Collins COLLINS AND BELLOWS ON THE ISSUES Sen. Susan Collins, a Republican who has represented Maine for 18 years in Washington, is facing an energetic challenge by Democrat Shenna Bellows, the former executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Maine. Following is a synopsis of where the candidates stand on several key issues: MINIMUM WAGE COLLINS: Collins has opposed President Obama\u2019s and Democrats\u2019 proposal of increasing the federal minimum wage from $7.25 an hour to $10.10 an hour, citing one federal study that predicted such a large increase could result in up to 500,000 layoffs. She has signaled a willingness to support an unspecified lower amount, however, and in the spring tried unsuccessfully to build a bipartisan compromise on a lower threshold. BELLOWS: Bellows supports a $10.10 minimum wage and, like other Democrats, has made this a major platform in her campaign, arguing that the richest Americans are getting richer while the poorest are falling deeper into poverty. She has accused Republicans \u2013 including Collins \u2013 of turning their backs on low-income workers. AFFORDABLE CARE ACT COLLINS: The Republican voted against President Obama\u2019s health care reform bill in 2009 and has consistently voted in favor of Republican attempts to repeal or defund the law. But Collins has also sponsored or co-sponsored bills to change individual aspects of the law without repealing it, such as to change the definition of full-time work back to 40 hours from the law\u2019s current 30 hours. BELLOWS: The Democrat supports the law and has called on Gov. Paul LePage to expand Medicaid \u2013 or MaineCare \u2013 as allowed under the law, to cover an additional 70,000 people. ENVIRONMENT COLLINS: Collins supports the proposed Keystone XL pipeline that would carry crude oil from the tar sands region of Canada to the Gulf Coast. She voted twice against Republican attempts to block the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency from regulating greenhouse gas emissions. However, she has yet to specify where she stands on the Obama administration\u2019s most recent proposal to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from power plants. Collins has supported federal efforts to reduce cross-state pollution from coal-burning power plants. BELLOWS: Bellows opposes the Keystone XL pipeline. She supports the Obama administration\u2019s proposal to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from power plants and has criticized Collins for not taking a clear stance on the proposal to date. She also supports other federal efforts to reduce cross-state pollution from coal-burning power plants. ABORTION COLLINS: Collins is pro-choice and considered to be a fairly reliable Republican vote on issues of protecting women\u2019s rights to obtain an abortion. Planned Parenthood gave her an 85 percent rating in 2014. BELLOWS: Bellows is pro-choice and often fought bills considered to be anti-abortion in the Maine Legislature as the executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Maine. \u2014 Kevin Miller Search photos available for purchase: Photo Store \u2192\n\n\u201cHi, I\u2019m Susan,\u201d she says again as she moves to the next group.\n\nFrom the bare-bones website to the senator\u2019s first-name-only greeting, Collins\u2019 campaign for another six-year term in the U.S. Senate is geared toward simplicity, reassurance \u2013 and familiarity. It\u2019s an incumbent defense strategy against an energetic Democratic challenger, Shenna Bellows, who contends that Collins\u2019 portrayal of herself as a moderate Republican willing to buck her party falls well short of the truth when she is in Washington.\n\nPolls suggest the strategy, combined with Collins\u2019 popularity, is holding its own against Bellows\u2019 increasingly aggressive campaign.\n\n\u201cWe like her personality and the kind of demeanor that she has,\u201d said Gordon Corbett, who along with his wife, Ruth, strolled over from their nearby home to greet and personally thank Collins during a stop at Ames Farm Center in North Yarmouth. Both Corbetts identified themselves as unenrolled or independent voters \u2013 a demographic Bellows desperately needs to win.\n\nCollins, 61, is a Republican in a state that has not voted for one of her party\u2019s presidential picks since the 1980s. As one of the few remaining representatives of the \u201cshrinking center\u201d in Washington, she is often courted by both parties as a swing vote on major issues \u2013 and often holds the attention of both her colleagues and the D.C. media by not stating her position publicly until voting day.\n\nShe is a pro-choice, anti-Obamacare defense hawk who supports the Keystone XL pipeline but has resisted her party\u2019s attempts to derail President Obama\u2019s plans to regulate carbon pollution.\n\nCollins is also popular at a time when the approval rating for Congress as a whole consistently hovers in the low teens and even dips into the single digits in some polls. A 2013 survey conducted by the Democratic-leaning firm Public Policy Polling said Collins had one of the highest approval ratings for a sitting senator in the country.\n\nThe Bellows campaign argues that Collins\u2019 star has dimmed among Democrats and independents because of her opposition to, among other things, a $10.10 minimum wage, the Democrats\u2019 Veterans Affairs bill and an \u201cequal pay\u201d measure. To underscore that contention, the challenger\u2019s campaign is airing ads with former Collins voters now backing Bellows.\n\nThe Collins campaign counters that Maine voters don\u2019t have to take its word about the senator\u2019s record of cross-aisle collaboration. Maine\u2019s senior senator was recently ranked as the most middle-of-the-road member of her party in the National Journal\u2019s annual measure of partisanship in Congress.\n\nShe was in the national headlines last October for leading a \u201ctri-partisan\u201d group of senators \u2013 Republicans, Democrats and Sen. Angus King, I-Maine \u2013 that tried to broker a compromise to end the 16-day federal government shutdown. In April, as Collins talked with colleagues about a minimum-wage deal that never came to fruition, The Washington Post ran an analysis titled \u201cHow Susan Collins Became the Senate\u2019s Key Deal-maker.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times, meanwhile, published a vote analysis in August that ranked Collins and Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, respectively, as the most likely Republicans to buck their party on votes in the current congressional session (Collins voted with Republicans 58 percent of the time).\n\n\u201cTo say I vote in lockstep with anyone is provably false,\u201d Collins said recently. \u201cI think it is very disappointing that my opponent is trying to spread that myth.\u201d\n\nBellows\u2019 most frequent criticisms of Collins focus on her opposition to a $10.10 minimum wage (Collins and other Republicans contend it will harm businesses and squash jobs), her opposition to the Affordable Care Act and for her votes against the Paycheck Fairness Act. That Democrat-sponsored bill would have, among other things, required employers to justify paying men and women different wages for the same job and allowed punitive lawsuits for wage discrimination. Critics argued the bill would pose a paperwork nightmare for businesses by requiring them to report confidential wage data to the government and would create a windfall for trial lawyers.\n\nThe Bellows camp also accused Collins of glossing over her votes with Republicans leading up to the government shutdown.\n\n\u201cThe question for Democrats and independents who supported Susan Collins in the past is, whose side will she be on the next time these votes will be taken?\u201d Bellows said recently.\n\nCollins said she was disappointed by Bellows\u2019 \u201cnegative campaign\u201d and called it \u201cludicrous\u201d for Bellows to suggest that she opposed paying women the same as men, noting that President Obama invited her to the White House for the 2009 signing of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which extended the window for equal-pay lawsuits. Collins also pointed out that both former Sen. Olympia Snowe and later King, who caucuses with the Democrats, opposed the bill.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t the right answer to the problem of pay discrimination in the workplace, and that is why I opposed the bill,\u201d Collins said.\n\nBorn into a politically active family in the Aroostook County city of Caribou, Collins credits her parents and the late Maine Sen. Margaret Chase Smith with inspiring her to pursue public service.\n\nCollins was elected to the Senate in 1996 and served many of the years since alongside Snowe, another moderate Republican. Snowe\u2019s retirement at the end of 2012 because of Washington\u2019s hyper-partisanship elevated Collins\u2019 status.\n\nShe currently ranks No. 24 in the 100-seat Senate\u2019s seniority list but is the highest-ranking Republican woman. If Republicans win control of the Senate, as some observers are predicting, Collins would be in line (although not guaranteed) to take over as chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, as well as chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging.\n\n\u201cSeniority really counts in Washington,\u201d Collins said. In addition to working with other senators, veteran lawmakers build relationships with \u2013 and have access to \u2013 senior officials in presidential administrations, she said.\n\nIncumbency brings with it a host of benefits in congressional races, among them national fundraising ability, party support and, perhaps most of all, name recognition. Collins has outraised Bellows by more than a 2-to-1 margin.\n\nIt was clear during Collins\u2019 recent campaign swing through Gray, Yarmouth and North Yarmouth that many Mainers know her.\n\nSome, like the Corbetts, came to meet her for the first time while others, like Caroline Sweeney of Yarmouth, came to greet her again. Sweeney testified before Congress eight years ago at Collins\u2019 request about the importance of improved, continuous monitoring for the Type I diabetes afflicting her then 4-year-old son, Aiden. Sweeney partly credits Collins for helping bring attention, then research dollars to the issue.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a supporter because I\u2019ve seen the impact, personally, that she has had on my son,\u201d Sweeney said.\n\nIn the Gray pizzeria, Collins heard from one woman still seeking help from her office with navigating the Department of Veterans Affairs bureaucracy for her husband\u2019s benefits. Another talked about her challenges acquiring health care.\n\nIn downtown Yarmouth, an international student \u2013 and his adviser who saw the bus \u2013 stopped to thank Collins for her office\u2019s work to help him secure a visa to study in Maine. Another woman, Colombia native Maria Lopez who is now a U.S. citizen, asked Collins to do something to speed up the processing of would-be immigrants, like her son, waiting for years for authorization to come to the U.S.\n\nBellows, meanwhile, continues to hound Collins on votes she believes are inconsistent with the Republican\u2019s moderate self-portrayal. She also paints a much different picture of the implications of a Collins win \u2013 namely, that Maine could help give Republicans the Senate.\n\n\u201cSusan\u2019s first vote will be for Mitch McConnell,\u201d Bellows said in reference to the conservative Kentucky senator likely to be elected majority leader of a Republican-controlled Senate. \u201cThe stakes in this race are very high.\u201d\n\nBack on her rolling campaign bus, the incumbent was more reassuring.\n\n\u201cRegardless of whether Republicans or Democrats win, I believe I will continue to play a pivotal role building coalitions and continuing to tackle issues,\u201d Collins said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Susan Collins, Maine's longtime Republican senator, keeps her message simple and reaps the benefits of incumbency.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "description": "Susan Collins, Maine's longtime Republican senator, keeps her message simple and reaps the benefits of incumbency.", "title": "Race for the U.S. Senate: The veteran - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 999, "identifier": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/517757_165972-20140930_sencollin5.jpg", "height": 666}, "updated_time": "2014-10-23T12:55:55-04:00", "url": "http://www.pressherald.com/2014/10/12/race-for-the-u-s-senate-the-veteran/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Susan Collins, Maine's longtime Republican senator, keeps her message simple and reaps the benefits of incumbency.", "creator": "@pressherald", "image": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/517757_165972-20140930_sencollin5.jpg", "title": "Race for the U.S. Senate: The veteran - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "site": "@pressherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=951845858", "fb": {"admins": 769488179, "app_id": 178078215650057}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pressherald", "section": "Local & State", "tag": "National Senate race", "published_time": "2014-10-12T04:00:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-23T12:55:55-04:00"}, "google-site-verification": "QWs9pxQP8fwo2-nR5mWopc6qCK2D3920f7bl-U-zkso", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc788\"", "article_summary": "ENVIRONMENT COLLINS: Collins supports the proposed Keystone XL pipeline that would carry crude oil from the tar sands region of Canada to the Gulf Coast.\nBELLOWS: Bellows opposes the Keystone XL pipeline.\nBELLOWS: Bellows is pro-choice and often fought bills considered to be anti-abortion in the Maine Legislature as the executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Maine.\nThe Collins campaign counters that Maine voters don\u2019t have to take its word about the senator\u2019s record of cross-aisle collaboration.\nABORTION COLLINS: Collins is pro-choice and considered to be a fairly reliable Republican vote on issues of protecting women\u2019s rights to obtain an abortion."}
