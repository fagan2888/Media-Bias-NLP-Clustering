This announcement was controversial because, as The Washington Post reports, an audit by his department\u2019s own inspector general found \u201cthat the agency has done a poor job of overseeing federal dollars sent to charter schools.\u201d\n\nPost reporter Lynsey Layton notes, \u201cThe agency\u2019s inspector general issued a scathing report in 2012 that found deficiencies in how the department handled federal grants to charter schools between 2008 and 2011\u2033 \u2013 in other words, during Duncan\u2019s watch.\n\nEven more perplexing is that the largest grant of $71 million ($32.5 the first year) is going to Ohio, the state that has the worst reputation for allowing low-performing charter schools to divert tax money away from educational purposes and do little to raise the achievement of students.\n\nA number of Ohio officials were shocked by the news.\n\nAs a different article from The Post reports, Democratic Party Representative Tim Ryan \u201cwas alarmed\u201d by the Education Department\u2019s decision. Ryan called his state\u2019s charter school sector \u201cbroken and dysfunctional.\u201d\n\nTed Strickland, an ex-Governor and now Democratic candidate for a US Senate seat in Ohio, wrote Duncan a letter telling him to reconsider the Ohio grant. \u201cToo many of Ohio\u2019s charter schools are an embarrassment,\u201d he states. Strickland quotes from a recent study showing charters in his state perform significantly worse than public schools. He points to a recent scandal in which the person in the state\u2019s department of education responsible for oversight of charters had to resign because he was caught \u201crigging the books.\u201d\n\nEven Ohio Republicans are disturbed about Secretary Duncan\u2019s generosity to charter schools in the Buckeye State. Like a parent who sees a visiting relative doling out chocolate bars to an already stimulated child, State Auditor Dave Yost quickly stated his concerns about the new charter school largesse to the media and his intention to track how the money is spent. Yost should know. An audit he conducted earlier this year found charter schools in the state misspend millions of tax dollars.\n\n\u201cWhy is the Department rewarding this unacceptable behavior,\u201d Strickland asked in his letter.\n\nMoney For What?\n\nCertainly throwing unaccounted for federal tax money at charter schools is nothing new.\n\nA recent report from the Center for Media and Democracy found that over the past 20 years the federal government has sent over $3.3 billion to the charter school industry with virtually no accountability. That report notes \u201cthe federal government maintains no comprehensive list of the charter schools that have received and spent these funds or even a full list of the private or quasi-public entities that have been approved by states to \u2018authorize\u2019 charters that receive federal funds.\u201d\n\nBut Secretary Duncan has been particularly generous to charter schools. One of the conditions states had to meet to win a Race to the Top grant, his signature program, was to raise any caps they may have had on the number of charter schools allowed to operate in the state. His department warned states receiving waivers to the onerous provisions of No child Left Behind not to do enact any new policies that would undermine charter schools\u2019 \u201cautonomy.\u201d\n\nCongress has done its part too, raising the amount of federal money going to charter schools through the Charter School Grants program.\n\nThe CMD report cited above calculated that the feds are expected to increase charter school funding by 48 percent in FY 2016, which would have been Duncan\u2019s last year on the job. That\u2019s about $375 million more for charters estimates journalist Juan Gonzalez.\n\nYet at the same time federal support for charter schools continues to grow, revelations increasingly show the results of that spending are frequently disastrous.\n\nDollars For Disaster\n\nA recent report from the Center for Popular Democracy and the Alliance to Reclaim Our Schools (AROS) uncovered over $200 million in \u201calleged and confirmed financial fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement\u201d committed by charter schools around the country.\n\nThe report follows a similar report released a year ago by the same groups that detailed $136 million in fraud and waste and mismanagement in 15 of the 42 states that operate charter schools. The 2015 report cites $203 million, including the 2014 total plus $23 million in new cases, and $44 million in earlier cases not included in the previous year\u2019s report.\n\nAuthors of the report called $200-plus million the \u201ctip of the iceberg,\u201d because much of the fraud \u201cwill go undetected because the federal government, the states, and local charter authorizers lack the oversight necessary to detect the fraud.\u201d\n\nAdding to concerns over how federal funds for charter schools are used, state audits, like the one conducted in Ohio, have also found widespread financial fraud and abuse committed by these schools.\n\nAlthough the CPD-AROS report made policy recommendations for mandatory audits of charters and increased transparency and accountability for these schools, none of those recommendations seem to have gotten any attention, much less action, from Duncan and his staff.\n\nA Process Cloaked In Mystery\n\nBoth the ends and the means of federal grants to charter schools remain mostly a mystery. Not only do we not know what happens to most of the money; we don\u2019t know how recipients for the money are chosen.\n\nAs CMD\u2019s Jonas Persson writes on that organization\u2019s PR Watch blog, \u201cThe public is being kept in the dark about which states have applied for the lucrative grants, and what their actual track records are when it comes to preventing fraud and misuse \u2026 The U.S Department of Education has repeatedly refused to honor a CMD request under the Freedom of Information Act for the grant applications, even though public information about which states have applied would not chill deliberation and might even help better assess which applicants should receive federal money.\u201d\n\nAlso unknown are the names of the \u201cpeers\u201d who review applications for the grant money.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Officials are raising questions about a $249 million grant to charter schools announced the day of his resignation", "title": "The ugly charter school scandal Arne Duncan is leaving behind", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Officials are raising questions about a $249 million grant to charter schools announced the day of his resignation", "title": "The ugly charter school scandal Arne Duncan is leaving behind", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/10/11/the_ugly_charter_school_scandal_arne_duncan_is_leaving_behind_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/arne_duncan.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Officials are raising questions about a $249 million grant to charter schools announced the day of his resignation", "title": "The ugly charter school scandal Arne Duncan is leaving behind", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/arne_duncan.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Jeff Bryant", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Arne Duncan, Charter schools, Education, Education Opportunity Network", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Ryan called his state\u2019s charter school sector \u201cbroken and dysfunctional.\u201dTed Strickland, an ex-Governor and now Democratic candidate for a US Senate seat in Ohio, wrote Duncan a letter telling him to reconsider the Ohio grant.\nA Process Cloaked In MysteryBoth the ends and the means of federal grants to charter schools remain mostly a mystery.\nTopics: Arne Duncan, Charter schools, Education, Education Opportunity Network, Politics NewsThis piece originally appeared on Education Opportunity NetworkUS Secretary of Education Arne Duncan\u2019s surprise announcement to leave his position in December is making headlines and driving lots of commentary, but an important story lost in the media clutter happened three days before he gave notice.\nOn that day, Duncan rattled the education policy world with news of a controversial grant of $249 million ($157 the first year) to the charter school industry.\nAn audit he conducted earlier this year found charter schools in the state misspend millions of tax dollars."}
