Tyler Cowen wonders why Republicans have chosen to go after the food stamp program, which he concedes is actually pretty good. He suggests that it’s a sign of weakness, because the GOP isn’t willing or able to go after the big items like Medicare. But this begs the question, why does the inability to go after programs that really are problems (although the disability story isn’t nearly as problematic as he thinks) mean that you should go after a program that isn’t a problem? There’s no significant money to be saved — if and when the economy recovers, SNAP will be back down to something like 0.25 percent of GDP.

Well, I have a theory. Republicans know, just know, that there has been a huge expansion of government under Obama; witness Rand Paul’s flabbergastedness (flabbergastnicity?) when I told him that public employment was down. The trouble is that the data don’t say what they know must be true. Here’s federal spending as a percentage of potential GDP:

So here’s the thing about SNAP: it’s one federal program that really has exploded in size in recent years, with the number of beneficiaries rising around 80 percent. Of course, it’s exploded for a very good reason, namely a once-in-three-generations economic crisis, and the program has stayed large because our so-called recovery hasn’t trickled down to the bottom half of the income distribution. But the right doesn’t care about any of that; in food stamps, it gets to see what it wants to see — surging government spending! Millions of takers! And so food stamps become public enemy #2.

Number 1 is, of course, Obamacare, which really does represent a major expansion of the government’s role. And that, perhaps, is where Cowen’s weakness theory may come in: Republicans, frantic over their inability to kill health reform, may be trying to make themselves feel better by lashing out at the poor.
