With that in mind, I want to spotlight health disparities in the black community and how we can stay healthier and live longer.\n\nAccording to the CDC Health Disparities and Inequalities Report \u2014 United States, 2013, here are some of the disparities:\n\nAfrican American adults develop diabetes at twice the rate of white adults.\n\nAfrican Americans had \u201cthe largest incidence and death rates\u201d from colorectal cancer compared with all other racial and ethnic populations.\n\nAfrican Americans die more often from heart disease and strokes.\n\nAfrican American adults have \u201cthe largest prevalence of hypertension\u2026diabetes, obesity, or a disability.\u201d\n\nAfrican American and Hispanic adults tend to experience high blood pressure at higher rates than white adults.\n\n>> Visit AARP Black Community\n\nThe good news is that the health disparities gap is closing. Louis Sullivan, M.D., founding president of the Morehouse School of Medicine and former secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, says that at the start of the 20th century, the disparity in life expectancy between blacks and whites was 15 to 17 years; now the gap is five to eight years.\n\nBut that\u2019s still a significant gap. Besides healthy eating and exercise, Sullivan offers three lifesaving strategies to help close the gap:\n\nFirst, if you\u2019re having symptoms that you know are strange, see a doctor \u2014 now. African Americans tend to hope that a symptom or condition will eventually disappear instead of spending money to see a doctor. But it\u2019s best to not \u201cwait until a minor condition becomes a major one,\u201d Sullivan says. If necessary, get Medicaid or affordable health insurance. Plus, by seeing a doctor immediately, you might prevent a major, even more costly or deadly health situation later.\n\nSecond, educate yourself on health issues so you will know the questions to ask your doctors. Sullivan says doctors sometimes have unconscious and conscious biases. He points out that a doctor may assume that an African American patient can\u2019t afford certain treatments; therefore in the case of diabetes, for example, amputation may be recommended when another, more costly treatment might be available.\n\nFinally, encourage family members and loved ones to see a doctor regularly. For example, sometimes pregnant African American and Latina women see an obstetrician for the first time once they\u2019re in labor, when they should have started regular checkups in the first trimester. Sullivan stresses that this contributes to the disparate infant mortality and premature birth rates.\n\nGet discounts on prescriptions, health exams, eye care and more \u2014 AARP Member Advantages. \u00bb\n\nThe CDC\u2019s theme for Minority Health Month 2015 is \u201cPrevention Is Power: Taking Action for Health Equity!\u201d We agree. If you\u2019re having symptoms, don\u2019t wait. See a doctor.\n\nAARP helps people turn their goals and dreams into real possibilities, strengthens communities and fights for and equips Americans 50 and older to live their best lives.
