Consumers who already have individually purchased policies are likely to face limited access to doctors and hospitals throughout the region, and some could face marked changes in access to the health care providers they\u2019ve become accustomed to using.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act has stripped insurers of a number of tools they historically have used to manage financial risk. Benefits must be standardized, there are limits on out-of-pocket costs and medical underwriting is a thing of the past.\n\n\u201cWhen you put all that in the blender and try to make it affordable what\u2019s left to control cost is the network itself,\u201d said Patrick Johnston, president and CEO of the California Association of Health Plans.\n\nSix insurers are selling individual policies through Covered California in San Diego:\n\nAnthem;\n\nBlue Shield;\n\nHealthNet;\n\nKaiser Permanente;\n\nMolina; and\n\nSharp.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to quantify just how narrow some of the provider networks are compared with those being sold outside of Covered California, and the networks remain in flux. But, a Los Angeles Times analysis of insurance data conducted prior to Covered California\u2019s Oct. 1 launch found that Health Net\u2019s exchange plans have provider networks one-third the size of those available through its employer policies. In San Diego for example, the company included only 204 primary care doctors to serve patients. Statewide, the Times reported that Blue Shield of California would provide exchange customers with access to about 50% of its regular physician network.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my understanding that 30 to 35% of all San Diego doctors will be in Covered California plans,\u201d said Craig Gussin, principle of San Diego-based Auerbach & Gussin Insurance and Financial Services.\n\nIt\u2019s not hard to see why. According to Theodore Mazer, a San Diego otolaryngologist and speaker of the California Medical Association\u2019s House of Delegates, in some cases insurers in San Diego have offered doctors reimbursement rates as low as 56% of what Medicare reimburses. \u201cThat\u2019s just basically above Medicaid, and pretty un-survivable,\u201d he said. As a general rule, according to Mazer, typical PPO physician reimbursement rates in San Diego range from 95% to 120% of Medicare rates.\n\nThis new landscape has fundamentally altered the way insurance agents approach their work with clients looking to purchase a new health insurance policy, according to Gussin. \u201cIn the old days, I\u2019d say, tell me what plan you\u2019re looking for and we\u2019ll figure it out. Now I say, tell me who your doctors are. Once we know what plans they\u2019re in, then I\u2019m going to come back and tell you, here are your options, unless you want to change doctors,\u201d he said.\n\nConfusion Is Widespread\n\nEven guiding one\u2019s health plan selection process by first looking for preferred doctors and hospitals and the plans with which they participate may not prevent patients from facing surprises when they go to make an appointment after the first of the year.\n\nAttempts to determine which plan a physician accepts might end up ultimately being wrong, experts say.\n\nNew partnerships created for Covered California plans are likely to cause confusion. For example, Blue Cross in San Diego has contracted with Sharp and UC-San Diego, so members signing on with one of the Blue Cross plans being sold through Covered California will face new limits on the physicians and hospitals they can use. \u201cSo if you\u2019re a Scripps person, you\u2019re not going to be having Blue Cross. Blue Shield only takes Scripps, Palomar and Pomerado,\u201d Gussin said.\n\nIn addition, the product offerings have changed \u2014 a critical detail that may escape notice even among participating physicians.\n\n\u201cWe call the doctor\u2019s office and they say, \u2018Oh, yeah, we take Blue Cross PPO.\u2019 Well, they do today, but they don\u2019t realize that starting in January, it\u2019s not a PPO, it\u2019s an EPO. So now there\u2019s no out-of-network coverage, and Blue Cross in San Diego only takes Sharp and UCSD doctors and hospitals,\u201d Gussin said.\n\nMany consumers in San Diego who have Blue Cross coverage now are accustomed to using another of the region\u2019s large providers \u2014 Scripps \u2014 but they will no longer be able to access Scripps depending on which plan they pick. And in many cases, physicians can\u2019t help their patients sort out the details.\n\n\u201cDoctors\u2019 offices have no idea. We have insurance companies\u2019 websites that we think are right. But we have no idea if once a doctor realizes how little they\u2019re going to get paid, are they going to say, \u2018No, we\u2019re not going to be taking that Covered California plan,'\u201d Gussin said. \u201cIn my opinion now it\u2019s a total mess because no one really knows which doctors are in the network.\u201d\n\nMazer acknowledged that he and many of his colleagues remain unclear about the makeup of the provider networks, even at this late date. \u201cWhen [insurers] let these products out earlier this year, they sent memorandums of understanding and asked, \u2018Are you willing to participate in the exchange product without rates being listed?\u2019 Well, most docs are bad businessmen, but we\u2019re not that bad that we\u2019re going to sign a contract where we don\u2019t know what we\u2019re going to get paid,\u201d he said.\n\nMazer added that he is concerned about whether patients really understand what products they\u2019re signing up for and how their access to physicians may be altered. \u201cDo they understand when they call us in January and they say, \u2018I have Blue Cross,\u2019 and we say, \u2018Which Blue Cross product? Sorry, you can\u2019t come here anymore, you\u2019re in the exchange and you have a limited network.\u2019 That\u2019s a big issue.\u201d\n\nNot a New Idea\n\nThe concept of tight provider networks is hardly new. Early HMO models relied on them and in recent years employers have been toying with bringing these models back into play, according to John Bagley, a Southern California-based senior health and group benefits consultant with Towers Watson, an employee benefits consulting firm.\n\n\u201cIn light of trying to focus on both quality and cost, the narrow network is one of several tools in the shed that employers and carriers are developing and promoting,\u201d he said.\n\nBut they also exist and thrive in the San Diego market primarily through two leading HMOs operating in the region \u2014 Sharp Healthcare and Kaiser Permanente.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re using existing commercial networks that we already use within our market,\u201d said Melissa Cook, CEO of Sharp Health Plan. \u201cWe have current clients that are utilizing them, and we did not create any new networks. We felt that was very important so that we could maintain high quality and high service levels,\u201d she said.\n\nKaiser Permanente members have access to the same network of doctors and hospitals whether they\u2019re covered by Medicaid or a platinum-level policy, according to Gussin.\n\nAlthough limiting choice is often perceived negatively, particularly when it comes to consumers\u2019 access to their doctors and hospitals, stakeholders agree narrow networks have real advantages when they are employed effectively.\n\n\u201cWhen you have a narrow network, especially one that is built around an integrated delivery system, you really have improved and enhanced coordination of care,\u201d Cook said. \u201cIt really allows you to establish very strong relationships with your patients and your members. So, that allows us to improve quality, it allows us to improve service and member satisfaction.\u201d\n\nWill Consumers Choose Plans With Narrow Networks?\n\nIn the end, the success or failure of narrow networks will depend on how they\u2019re used, and whether they\u2019ll be able to perform to the standards health care consumers in San Diego expect.\n\nExperts say the exchange environment\u2019s inherent competition, regulatory requirements to provide adequate networks and consumers\u2019 ability to switch plans each year at open enrollment time will put pressure on insurers to maintain network adequacy.\n\nIf they can\u2019t, Johnston said, \u201c[Consumers] have the power every year at open enrollment to vote with their feet and to go to a different plan without the fear that a pre-existing medical condition will prohibit them.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "<p style=\"margin:0 0 10pt;\">Insurers selling health plans through Covered California are limiting access to providers to hold down the cost of premiums.
