The opening of the new Ravenswood Family Health Clinic may be at least a year away, but the groundbreaking is expected to take place this week on Wednesday, Jan. 22.

The upcoming 38,000-square-foot, two-floor primary care facility at 1885 Bay Road in East Palo Alto is expected to double the number of patients the clinic can see annually, to 22,000, and add services, including mammography, integrated mental health care and an on-site pharmacy.

The $29 million project received an initial $5 million grant from the U.S. Health Resources and Services Administration in May 2012; funding became available through a provision of the Affordable Care Act that provided for increasing the capacity of community health centers, according to a press release.
