If she averages 10 wins this season and next in downhill and super-G, which she is very capable of doing if she remains healthy, she will break his record.\n\nIn a career spanning 1975 to 1989, Stenmark won 46 giant slalom races and 40 slalom races. The great Swede captured the final victory of his amazing career at Aspen in 1989. Vonn long ago surpassed the No. 2 man on the wins list, Hermann Maier (54).\n\nVonn, 31, is committed to racing three more seasons because she intends to compete in the 2018 Olympics in South Korea.\n\nSunday\u2019s race in Lake Louise was notable for another Vail Valley athlete, too. Slalom phenom Mikaela Shiffrin made her World Cup debut in a speed discipline \u2014 speed races being downhill and super-G \u2014 and finished a highly respectable 15th. Shiffrin\u2019s brother, Taylor, was a forerunner in the men\u2019s giant slalom Sunday at Beaver Creek.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a very technical sound skier,\u201d Taylor said before Mikaela\u2019s race. \u201cShe\u2019s very strong, powerful. I think she\u2019s going to go for it, but I think since it\u2019s her first speed event on the World Cup circuit, she\u2019s going to feel it out, see how it goes. I think she\u2019s going to be smart about it, to break the ice.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "All Things Olympics", "description": "For more than 20 years, Ingemar Stenmark's record of 86 World Cup wins was thought to be unbeatable, but Vail's Lindsey Vonn is becoming a real threat to surpass him.
