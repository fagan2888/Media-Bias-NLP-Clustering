One of the most popular goals every year is to get in better shape.\n\nLocal gyms in Wichita say they've seen between dozens to hundreds join over the past week with hopes to either trim fat or gain muscle.\n\n\"I'd sure like to lose weight and get some cardiovascular done,\" said David Doleshal.\n\n\"There's a bunch of people in here I've never seen before,\" Eli Copeland said while working out at Genesis Health Club.\n\nBut most years, it doesn't stay that way for long.\n\n\"There's a falloff because it takes time and people today want immediate results,\" said Genesis personal trainer Michael Wood.\n\nWood says a good portion of the New Year's resolution crowd stops visiting after about a month.\n\nHe shares a few tips to stick with your goal: First, find a workout partner to hold you accountable.\n\n\"It's really easy to not show up to the gym when it's just you so if you get a friend or a family member who's already working out it will actually help you show up more,\" said Wood.\n\nNext, learn how to properly use the equipment.\n\n\"Your joints can tear, you can hurt yourself really bad,\" he said. \"It's smart to take it slow.\"\n\nWood says most gyms offer a free opening tour to show you what will help you reach your resolution. Also, spread out your goal over a period of time. Say you want to lose ten pounds, shoot for a couple pounds a month.\n\n\"It takes consistency and time to get to what they want to do,\" Wood said.\n\nLastly, Wood says have beginners something to work for, maybe better self confidence or swimsuit season that's now just months away.\n\n\"If it's your new years resolution, just do you, don't listen to what anyone else says,\" added Copeland. Don't fall off the wagon, stay in it.\"\n\nGenesis Health Club managers tell KAKE News that they've already had more than a thousand people join their gyms across Kansas since the holiday.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "For many, a New Year's resolution is an annual tradition.
