The Broncos on Monday signed running back Kapri Bibbs to their active roster and waived linebacker Shaquil Barrett, the NFL team announced.

Bibbs (5-foot-11, 203 pounds) is a rookie who spent the first seven weeks of the season on Denverâ€™s practice squad after signing with the team as a college free agent from Colorado State University.

He rushed for 84 yards and a team-high three touchdowns on 19 carries during the preseason while seeing action in all four contests with Denver.

The Broncos added Bibbs as other teams began expressing interest in plucking him from their practice squad. Running back Juwan Thompson has been dealing with a sore knee, but this move reflects outside interest in Bibbs more than adding reinforcements for Thompson. Thompson, who beat out Bibbs for a final roster spot because of his acumen on special teams, practiced on Monday.

If Barrett clears waivers, the Broncos can add him back to their practice squad.
