A Kansas man and woman are charged after authorities say sheriff’s deputies found a 1-year-old baby and an improvised explosive device in a stolen van.

The Topeka Capital-Journal reports that Jackson County authorities arrested 34-year-old Christopher Dollen of Valley Falls and 28-year-old Cassandra Reveles of Denison on Friday.

Sheriff Tim Morse says deputies made the arrests after responding to a report Friday night of a suspicious vehicle parked near a pasture in Hoyt.

Morse says authorities found the baby, the explosive device, methamphetamine, marijuana and drug paraphernalia inside the van, which had been reported stolen in Shawnee County.

Dollen and Reveles are charged with various felonies including drug counts, child endangerment and trespassing. It’s unclear if they have attorneys.
