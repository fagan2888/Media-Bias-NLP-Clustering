That will allow the U.S. to maintain a division\u2019s worth of equipment in Europe and an additional combat brigade in central and eastern Europe.\n\n\u201cThose who claim our trans-Atlantic partnership is unraveling - or those who hope it might unravel - could not be more wrong,\u201d Kerry said.\n\nMedvedev\u2019s comments came shortly after Stoltenberg told the group that in response to a \u201cmore assertive Russia\u2026 which is destabilizing the European security order,\u201d the alliance does \u201cnot want a new Cold War but at the same time our response has to be firm.\u201d\n\nStoltenberg stressed the need for dialogue, but also defended NATO\u2019s move to strengthen defenses, including moving more troops and equipment to countries bordering Russia, and said at an upcoming summer summit in Warsaw he expected member countries \u201cto decide to further strengthen the alliance\u2019s defense and deterrence.\u201d\n\nHe underlined that NATO\u2019s deterrent also included nuclear weapons, saying \u201cno one should think that nuclear weapons can be used as part of a conventional conflict - it would change the nature of any conflict fundamentally.\u201d\n\nMedvedev scoffed at what he said was a suggestion that Russia may use nuclear weapons in a first strike. \u201cSometimes I wonder if it\u2019s 2016 or if we live in 1962,\u201d he said, referring to the year of the Cuban missile crisis.\n\nHe called for sanctions on Russia imposed after it annexed Crimea from Ukraine in March 2014 to be lifted, saying they were \u201ca road that leads nowhere.\u201d\n\nEarlier in the day, Medvedev suggested the West would harm itself if it did not lift the sanctions soon.\n\n\u201cThe longer the sanctions continue, chances for the Europeans to keep their position at the Russian market as investors and suppliers are fading,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why one has to act quickly.\u201d\n\nKerry said if Russia wants an end to sanctions, it has the \u201csimple choice\u201d to fully implement the Minsk peace accord agreed upon last year.\n\n\u201cRussia can prove by its actions that it will respect Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty, just as it insists on respect for its own,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also called upon Russia to strive for a peace deal in Syria, saying that its continued support of President Bashar Assad would just increase \u201cthe call to jihad\u201d and complicate the fight against the Islamic State group.\n\nHe said Russia and Assad are wrong if they think \u201cindiscriminate bombing\u201d will win the war.\n\n\u201cThe Syrians who have rejected Assad have endured four years of shelling, barrel bombs, gas, Scud missiles, chemical attacks, torture,\u201d Kerry said. \u201cThey may be pushed back here or there, but they are not going to surrender.\u201d\n\nUkraine\u2019s President Petro Poroshenko blasted Russia\u2019s actions in both Ukraine and Syria, saying they are \u201ca demonstration that we live in a completely different universe with Russia.\u201d\n\nHe said that the main danger to Europeans now is an \u201calternative Europe with alternative values\u201d such as isolation, intolerance and disrespect of human rights. Poroshenko added: \u201cThis alternative Europe has its own leader. His name is Mr. Putin.\u201d\n\n_____\n\nGeir Moulson contributed to this story.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Russia's prime minister accused the West on Saturday of rekindling the Cold War, telling a meeting of top defense officials, diplomats and national leaders that sanctions imposed after the annexation of Crimea and new moves by the NATO alliance \"only aggravate\" tensions.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Russia\u2019s prime minister accused the West on Saturday of rekindling the Cold War, telling a meeting of top defense officials, diplomats and national leaders that sanctions imposed after the annexation of Crimea and new moves by the NATO alliance \u201conly aggravate\u201d tensions.", "title": "Russian PM: West rekindling the Cold War", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/feb/13/russian-pm-west-rekindling-the-cold-war/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/02/12/germany_security_conference.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/02/12/germany_security_conference.jpeg", "description": "Russia's prime minister accused the West on Saturday of rekindling the Cold War, telling a meeting of top defense officials, diplomats and national leaders that sanctions imposed after the annexation", "card": "summary", "title": "Russian PM: West rekindling the Cold War"}, "Author": "DAVID RISING", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "MUNICH (AP) - Russia\u2019s prime minister accused the West on Saturday of rekindling the Cold War, telling a meeting of top defense officials, diplomats and national leaders that sanctions imposed after the annexation of Crimea and new moves by the NATO alliance \u201conly aggravate\u201d tensions.\nPresident Dalia Grybauskaite of Russia\u2019s neighbor Lithuania said Moscow \u201cis demonstrating open military aggression in Ukraine, open military aggression in Syria.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing about cold,\u201d she said.\nHe said Russia and Assad are wrong if they think \u201cindiscriminate bombing\u201d will win the war.\n\u201cRussia\u2019s rhetoric, posture and exercises of its nuclear forces are aimed at intimidating its neighbors, undermining trust and stability in Europe,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe longer the sanctions continue, chances for the Europeans to keep their position at the Russian market as investors and suppliers are fading,\u201d he said."}
