Chris Christie\u2019s office orchestrating the now-infamous George Washington Bridge lane closings, I\u2019ve had at least four different reactions.\n\nListed in chronological order, they were: He\u2019s dead; maybe not so bad if he didn\u2019t know anything; OMG, an elderly woman died! He\u2019s gone. Latest and hardly least, Christie may emerge relatively unscathed as the media displace him as villains.\n\nTo stipulate, we recognize that Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) made the sanest observation when asked Thursday to comment. \u201cI think the right approach is to be a bit prudent here and not jump to conclusions,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about this. So for me to comment beyond that would just not be, you know, appropriate.\u201d\n\nAhem, well, fine. There you have the difference between a senator in line to replace Christie as the leading Republican presidential candidate and \u2014 everybody else.\n\nOn the train from New York to Washington on Thursday, two words continuously rose above the din: Chris Christie. The best summation of how the scandal is playing politically came from two high-profile consultants who happened to be on the same train \u2014 Republican Mary Matalin and Democrat James Carville.\n\n\u201cBFD,\u201d said Matalin when I asked her thoughts.\n\n\u201cMay I quote you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\nCarville, somewhat less concise, said he gave Christie a C-minus on his nearly two-hour news conference, down from an initial B-plus. The lower grade followed further consideration that revealed contradictions and fuzzy details that didn\u2019t add up, he said. As just one example, also notably mentioned by Rush Limbaugh, Christie said he hadn\u2019t slept for a couple of days, but he had just found out about his staff\u2019s involvement the day before.\n\nSlip of the tongue, or vagueness in the service of subterfuge? Perhaps more to the point of Christie\u2019s future, Carville noted that Limbaugh and other high-profile conservatives aren\u2019t defending the governor.\n\nEven so, many Republicans in the Matalin camp see this as much ado about little, especially compared to, for instance, President Obama\u2019s repeated falsehoods about people keeping the health insurance they like under the Affordable Care Act. Democrats see this as the inevitable ruin of a bully run amok.\n\nBut another consequential feature of this controversy is an emerging narrative that, barring the unforeseen, could shift focus from Christie\u2019s administration to the greater villain \u2014 the media. Judging from my overflowing inbox, there\u2019s a growing sense on the right that Christie is being unfairly battered by a media all too eager to help defrock the Republican front-runner.\n\nNeedless to say, one bad deed (Obama\u2019s falsehoods) does not excuse another (misusing power to punish a political foe). The bridge scandal is compelling precisely because it fits the well-documented bullying image of Christie, notwithstanding his denials during the news conference. \u201cI am not a bully,\u201d he said, reminding us mostly of \u201cI am not a witch.\u201d Or \u201cI am not a crook.\u201d\n\nChristie\u2019s style was always going to be problematic for him in the primaries, especially in the polite South. But now he also can be viewed as a victim not only of malignant, malicious and mind-bendingly stupid staffers but also of a two-faced, pro-Democratic media.\n\nThe media are not monolithic, as we like to remind people. But we do have a tendency to focus on the latest scandal. And it does seem that we tend to treat Republican scandals as more delicious than others. This is owing less to the sins committed than to the greater sin of hypocrisy. The higher the bar, the harder they fall.\n\nBut Christie isn\u2019t a strong exhibit in the mean-media argument. More than a Republican, he is a colorful, larger-than-life character who speaks loudly and carries a big stick. Cameras will always find the most interesting landscape, and Christie has that turf covered. More to the salient point, as the leading Republican presidential candidate, he can hardly be ignored. Coverage of this fiasco isn\u2019t disproportionate to the man, even if it may be to the event.\n\nIf, indeed, Christie had no knowledge of the lane closings and if, in fact, he was betrayed by idiots \u2014 even though he hired and trusted those idiots \u2014 then he could survive.\n\nThose are big ifs. What is certain is that the only thing the Republican base hates more than a liar and a bully is a bullying media. Once that common enemy is established, the perceived victim often becomes the victor.\n\nRead more from Kathleen Parker\u2019s archive, follow her on Twitter or find her on Facebook.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The hate of a bullying media could save the bullying governor.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/kathleenparker", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The hate of a bullying media could save the bullying governor.", "title": "Kathleen Parker: Finding a new villain in the Chris Christie drama", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/kathleen-parker-finding-a-new-villain-in-the-chris-christie-drama/2014/01/10/5c1603de-7a38-11e3-b1c5-739e63e9c9a7_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/01/10/Editorial-Opinion/Images/2014-01-08T180158Z_01_TOR611_RTRIDSP_3_USA-NEWJERSEY-BRIDGE.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@kathleenparker"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/kathleen-parker-finding-a-new-villain-in-the-chris-christie-drama/2014/01/10/5c1603de-7a38-11e3-b1c5-739e63e9c9a7_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Kathleen Parker, Kathleen Parker column, Kathleen Parker washington post, bridgegate, bridge-gate, media chris christie, media republicans, media gop, chris christie press conference, chris christie news conference, chris christie bully, chris christie new jersey, george washington bridge, chris christie george washington bridge, chris christie fort lee,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/kathleenparker"}, "eomportal-uuid": "5c1603de-7a38-11e3-b1c5-739e63e9c9a7", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "Kathleen Parker, Kathleen Parker column, Kathleen Parker washington post, bridgegate, bridge-gate, media chris christie, media republicans, media gop, chris christie press conference, chris christie news conference, chris christie bully, chris christie new jersey, george washington bridge, chris christie george washington bridge, chris christie fort lee,"}, "article_summary": "On the train from New York to Washington on Thursday, two words continuously rose above the din: Chris Christie.\nChris Christie\u2019s office orchestrating the now-infamous George Washington Bridge lane closings, I\u2019ve had at least four different reactions.\nThere you have the difference between a senator in line to replace Christie as the leading Republican presidential candidate and \u2014 everybody else.\nLatest and hardly least, Christie may emerge relatively unscathed as the media displace him as villains.\nThe bridge scandal is compelling precisely because it fits the well-documented bullying image of Christie, notwithstanding his denials during the news conference."}
