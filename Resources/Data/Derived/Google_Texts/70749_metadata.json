A uterus transplant involves putting a healthy uterus in the place of one that is diseased or isn\u2019t there at all. A woman who doesn\u2019t have a uterus is unable to experience embryonic implantation, which essentially means she\u2019s infertile. But the Swedish mother, who wished to remain anonymous, was given a chance to have her own child thanks to the implanted uterus.\n\nThe baby was born prematurely but healthy, according to The Lancet, and weighed about 3.9 pounds. The child is \"amazing,\" the father said, according to the BBC. \"It was a pretty tough journey over the years, but we now have the most amazing baby,\" he said. \"He\u2019s no different from any other child, but he will have a good story to tell.\"\n\nThe replacement womb was from a 61-year-old woman, a family friend who had already undergone menopause years earlier. During a 10-hour operation last year, doctors implanted the donated organ into the to-be mother. She also underwent in vitro fertilization, had her eggs harvested and fertilized, then had an early-stage embryo inserted into her womb.\n\nProfessor Mats Brannstrom led the transplant team, and said that it was a miracle moment to see the first baby born in a transplanted womb. \u201cThat was a fantastic happiness for me and the whole team, but it was an unreal sensation also because we really could not believe we had reached this moment,\u201d he said. \u201cOur success is based on more than 10 years of intensive animal research and surgical training by our team, and opens up the possibility of treating many young females worldwide that suffer from uterine infertility.\u201d\n\nThough exciting, womb transplants can still be dangerous to a woman\u2019s health, especially since the drugs the woman took to prevent organ rejection have been linked to cancer. After giving birth to the child, it\u2019s likely that the Swedish mother will have to have the womb removed in order to prevent long-term damage from the drugs, or her body rejecting the organ.\n\nDoctors, meanwhile, hope to continue working on making it safer and better so that other women with womb transplants can also give birth to children. \u201cI think it is brilliant and revolutionary, and opens the door to many infertile women,\u201d Dr. Allan Pacey, the chairman of the British Fertility Society, told the BBC. \u201cThe scale of it feels a bit like [in vitro fertilization]. It feels like a step change. The question is can it be done repeatedly, reliably, and safely.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt gives hope to those women and men that thought they would never have a child, that thought they were out of hope,\u201dsaid Liza Johannesson, a gynaecological surgeon on the team.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "uterus transplant, baby born to womb transplant, womb", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Doctors in Sweden are rejoicing after a woman successfully gave birth to a child in a transplanted womb.", "title": "A Medical First: Woman With Transplanted Womb Gives Birth", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/womb-transplant-woman-transplanted-womb-successfully-gives-birth-baby-boy-medical-first-306254", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/04/infant.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Doctors in Sweden are rejoicing after a woman successfully gave birth to a child in a transplanted womb.", "title": "A Medical First: Woman With Transplanted Womb Gives Birth", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/womb-transplant-woman-transplanted-womb-successfully-gives-birth-baby-boy-medical-first-306254", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/04/infant.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/04/infant.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-10-04T16:07:09-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-06T08:58:13-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Doctors in Sweden are rejoicing after a woman successfully gave birth to a child in a transplanted womb."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd85ad\"", "article_summary": "Doctors in Sweden have reported the first baby to be successfully delivered in a transplanted womb, calling the feat a medical first.\nProfessor Mats Brannstrom led the transplant team, and said that it was a miracle moment to see the first baby born in a transplanted womb.\nThe baby was born prematurely but healthy, according to The Lancet, and weighed about 3.9 pounds.\nA woman who doesn\u2019t have a uterus is unable to experience embryonic implantation, which essentially means she\u2019s infertile.\nThe mother, 36, had been born without a uterus, but received a donated womb from a friend who was already in her 60s."}
