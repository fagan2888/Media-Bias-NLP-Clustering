NEW YORK–(BUSINESS WIRE)–BeneStream today announced additional investment from BlueCross BlueShield Venture Partners and Sandbox Advantage Fund, closing out its Series A Round of financing.

“This investment by BlueCross BlueShield Venture Partners and Sandbox Advantage Fund demonstrates that health insurance companies understand the importance of Medicaid enrollment as a strategy for managing the overall cost of health insurance for businesses while increasing employee access to health benefits,” said Ben Geyerhahn, CEO and Co-Founder. “We look forward to working with the Blue Cross Blue Shield Venture Partners and its limited partners to support our efforts to seek distribution at national scale.”

BeneStream’s process informs employees if they qualify for government sponsored health insurance and is proven to deliver cost savings as a component of a health insurance package for qualified companies. The process utilizes the Medicaid expansion portion of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) which makes access to healthcare coverage more affordable for many employees and their families who weren’t previously eligible.

“I am excited to join BeneStream’s board as the team is addressing a key piece of the benefits puzzle. The company is emerging as a market leader at informing employees of the benefits to which they are qualified. BeneStream is also well positioned to capitalize on opportunities that emerge from further expansion of Medicaid and the proliferation of Managed Medicaid,” said Anna Haghgooie, Managing Director of Sandbox Industries, who will represent BlueCross BlueShield Venture Partners on the Board.
