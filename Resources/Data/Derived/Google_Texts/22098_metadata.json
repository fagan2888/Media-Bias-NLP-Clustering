How do I explain when he asks where\u2019s Mommy?\u201d\n\nKarisa Bugal died Nov. 4, hours after giving birth the day before to the couple\u2019s second child, a son named Declan. She had developed a rare complication called amniotic fluid embolism, which causes protective fluids around a baby to escape into the mother\u2019s body, resulting in a breakdown of her organs.\n\nAfter medical staff informed Bugal of the danger the embolism posed, she had two options: undergo surgery that could save her life but endanger Declan, whose heart rate had begun to dip, or get a Caesarean section to save her unborn baby\u2019s life but put her own at risk.\n\nBugal chose the second option, a decision that a few hours later resulted in her death.\n\nFriends set up a fundraiser page to help Wes Bugal raise the couple\u2019s two children. In just one day, the site surpassed its goal of $20,000.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It was a decision that ultimately ended a mother's life while saving her seven-pound, four-ounce \u201cmiracle.\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "It was a decision that ultimately ended a mother's life while saving her seven-pound, four-ounce \u201cmiracle.\u201d", "title": "Putting the Life of Her Unborn Baby First, Mother Dies After Giving Birth", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/141124_UnbornSaved2.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-11-28T09:21:26+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1HG8P84"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "It was a decision that ultimately ended a mother's life while saving her seven-pound, four-ounce \u201cmiracle.\u201d", "title": "Putting the Life of Her Unborn Baby First, Mother Dies After Giving Birth", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/141124_UnbornSaved2.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "Marriage & Family", "published_time": "2014-11-28T03:01:17+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-28T09:21:26+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "protecting life, unborn children, Bugal, Karisa Bugal, mother, pro-life"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1619\"", "article_summary": "In a selfless act, a mother from Aurora, Colo., made a decision during childbirth that put the life of her unborn baby son before her own.\nFriends set up a fundraiser page to help Wes Bugal raise the couple\u2019s two children.\nHow do I explain when he asks where\u2019s Mommy?\u201dKarisa Bugal died Nov. 4, hours after giving birth the day before to the couple\u2019s second child, a son named Declan.\nBugal chose the second option, a decision that a few hours later resulted in her death.\nThat decision ultimately ended her life while saving her seven-pound, four-ounce \u201cmiracle.\u201d\u201cHow do I explain to him that his mom is gone giving birth to him?\u201d the woman\u2019s husband, Wes Bugal, asked in an interview with NBC 9 News in Aurora."}
