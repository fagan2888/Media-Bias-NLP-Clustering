And a plan needs to be in place, since Kennedy Metro is losing its location next school year to a new elementary school that is meant to ease crowding in the eastern part of the county.\n\nDistrict officials have repeatedly said they aren\u2019t planning to eliminate Kennedy Metro.\n\nSchool board member Chris Brady, whose district includes Kennedy Metro, said he\u2019s been told a proposal is forthcoming, but said he hasn\u2019t been given details on what JCPS may want to do with Kennedy and the other alternative schools.\n\n\u201cI would prefer to see it before April,\u201d Brady said. \u201cWe need to have an idea of what the proposal is. That needs to be presented to us with a good amount of time so everyone is on the same page.\u201d\n\nHensley said he laid out his ideas for restructuring the alternative schools to the schools\u2019 principals earlier this week, and asked them for ideas on steps that could be taken to improve the alternative programs.\n\nHensley said one idea he\u2019s looking at is creating \u201cacademies\u201d that are designed more around individual students\u2019 needs or ages than around their grade levels, although he\u2019s also brought up the idea of making the Kennedy/Buechel building a grade 6-10 school and moving grades 11 and 12 to Breckinridge Metro High.\n\n\u201cWe are creating a report soon (that) will allow us to look at ages of kids and other criteria for placements to see how that would shift enrollment,\u201d Hensley said.\n\nHe said he\u2019d like to potentially see one academy designed as a transition to quickly get students back into more traditional schools, and have another academy with special supports for students with mental and behavioral health needs. Hensley said he\u2019d like to see students placed in schools based more on needs than on the offenses they committed or their grades.\n\nThe idea of \u201csuccess pathway systems\u201d for the alternative schools is expected to be discussed during a work session with the school board Monday afternoon.\n\n\u201cReally, what we\u2019re doing is putting together a framework,\u201d Hensley said. \u201cI\u2019m asking the principals and the leadership teams to ... design an academy that could better differentiate the needs of kids.\u201d\n\nHensley said he\u2019s heard some who are concerned or upset about the idea of putting Kennedy middle students with the older grades at Buechel. But he said people knew that \u201cKennedy obviously had to go somewhere,\u201d and said the district is certainly \u201cserious about ensuring safety inside our schools.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: http://cjky.it/1D7FP7h", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "JCPS wants to revamp its alternative school system; needs to find a home for Kennedy", "og": {"site_name": "The Courier-Journal", "description": "JCPS wants to revamp its alternative school system; needs to find a home for Kennedy", "title": "JCPS considers moving Kennedy Metro to Buechel", "url": "http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/education/2015/02/07/jcps-considers-moving-kennedy-metro-buechel/23006805/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/courier-journal.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "JCPS wants to revamp its alternative school system; needs to find a home for Kennedy", "creator": "@courierjournal", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e5fb00021ca72c3ac07d57b471ebc9dd85d6aed8/c=0-0-225-225&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Louisville/2015/02/06/B9316154581Z.1_20150206181226_000_G0T96RGD5.7-0.jpg", "title": "JCPS considers moving Kennedy Metro to Buechel", "site": "@courierjournal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600030236", "fb": {"app_id": 128534137209813}, "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Subjects/Mental health", "gci-asset-type": "data", "gci-categories": "Subjects/Mental health", "title": "JCPS considers moving Kennedy Metro to Buechel", "author": "Allison Ross", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/education", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/fe43efb821ee703fc5d3445b2a27a8de75206c27/c=28-0-197-225/local/-/media/Louisville/2015/02/06/B9316154581Z.1_20150206181226_000_G0T96RGD5.7-0.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e5553d9ad29b3854d3fce8cebf38e7c107b8cfaf/c=0-0-225-225/local/-/media/Louisville/2015/02/06/B9316154581Z.1_20150206181226_000_G0T96RGD5.7-0.jpg", "contenttype": "data", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/01a1dfcf7202e44f64a7989838452cfeaa02389f/c=0-28-225-197/local/-/media/Louisville/2015/02/06/B9316154581Z.1_20150206181226_000_G0T96RGD5.7-0.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/fcf176860a8fcbe6ba7dc1982bc2fe2f162ede18/c=0-49-225-176&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/Louisville/2015/02/06/B9316154581Z.1_20150206181226_000_G0T96RGD5.7-0.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-02-07T07:00:42.277000-05:00", "shorthed": "JCPS considers moving Kennedy Metro", "articleid": 23006805, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1314a4352da0024ccfaf5f8756436b3092b525a5/c=0-49-225-176/local/-/media/Louisville/2015/02/06/B9316154581Z.1_20150206181226_000_G0T96RGD5.7-0.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d84916e8618fb5c825bdca439a3c0e4ec8c1633e/c=49-0-176-225/local/-/media/Louisville/2015/02/06/B9316154581Z.1_20150206181226_000_G0T96RGD5.7-0.jpg"}}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "JCPS, alternative schools, Kennedy Metro, Buechel, Allison Ross, Chris Brady, Dewey Hensley"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdeccc\"", "article_summary": "Jefferson County Public Schools officials are considering moving middle school students from the alternative school Kennedy Metro to a floor at Buechel Metropolitan High as part of a broader plan to make changes to the district\u2019s alternative schools structure next school year.\nJCPS chief academic officer Dewey Hensley stressed that no official decisions have been made, although he said he does at this point plan to recommend putting Kennedy at Buechel.\nSchool board member Chris Brady, whose district includes Kennedy Metro, said he\u2019s been told a proposal is forthcoming, but said he hasn\u2019t been given details on what JCPS may want to do with Kennedy and the other alternative schools.\nAnd a plan needs to be in place, since Kennedy Metro is losing its location next school year to a new elementary school that is meant to ease crowding in the eastern part of the county.\nThe idea of \u201csuccess pathway systems\u201d for the alternative schools is expected to be discussed during a work session with the school board Monday afternoon."}
