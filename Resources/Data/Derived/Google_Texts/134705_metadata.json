The editors then consider a series of questions, the first of which is pretty basic: \u201cHas the percentage of uninsured people been reduced?\u201d\n\nTheir answer: yes. So, problem solved, right? Not quite.\n\nThe devil, as they say, is in the details. And the details show that it\u2019s not as simple as getting more people insured. A new report from health care expert Ed Haislmaier \u2014 one based on actual enrollment data, not surveys \u2014 illustrates two facts that should give us pause.\n\nOne is that the decline in the number of people who are uninsured isn\u2019t as high as it may seem at first glance. The other is that more than two-thirds of the gain in coverage is a result of an increase in the number of people in Medicaid, the federal government\u2019s health care program for the vulnerable poor.\n\nThis isn\u2019t exactly what Americans were led to believe would happen when the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, often referred to as Obamacare, became law.\n\nLet\u2019s look a little closer at the first point. Why isn\u2019t the number of newly insured people as high as it might seem?\n\nProponents of Obamacare, after all, can point to the 6.2 million Americans who have been enrolled in individual-market coverage since Obamacare took effect. You have to take into account, though, the 3.8 million who lost their employer-based coverage during the same period. As a result, the number of Americans who gained private health insurance increased by a bit less than 2.5 million in the first half of 2014.\n\nIn short, Mr. Haislmaier shows, decline in employment-based coverage offset 61 percent of the increase in individual-market coverage.\n\nWhy would so many people be losing employer-based coverage? Because of the negative incentives built into Obamacare. It\u2019s cheaper for many employers (who might otherwise face steep rises in coverage costs or fines from Washington) to stop offering coverage altogether and let their employees fall into government-run programs.\n\nNow let\u2019s consider the second point. During this same period, enrollment in Medicaid and the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program increased by almost 6.1 million individuals. Of the 8.5 million total individuals who gained health insurance coverage, 71 percent of that net coverage gain was due to Obamacare\u2019s expansion of Medicaid to able-bodied, working-age adults.\n\n\u201cThe inescapable conclusion,\u201d writes Mr. Haislmaier, \u201cis that, when it comes to covering the uninsured, Obamacare so far is mainly an expansion of Medicaid.\u201d\n\nThis is hardly what Americans were promised. Or what they expected when President Obama last year said that Obamacare is \u201cdoing what it\u2019s designed to do \u2014 deliver more choices, better benefits, a check on rising costs.\u201d\n\nToday, the president touts the millions of Americans who have gained coverage. However, we don\u2019t hear much in the way of context. Left unsaid is that a large number of the 6.2 million cited above already had individual or employer-based coverage but were forced by Obamacare to get new coverage.\n\nAlso unmentioned is the fact that the 6.1 million new Medicaid enrollees include able-bodied, working-age adults who are being given substandard government coverage in lieu of what they really need: a job.\n\nWe certainly don\u2019t hear much to contradict the much-hyped \u201ccheck on rising costs.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn eleven states, premiums for twenty-seven-year-olds have more than doubled since 2013; in thirteen states, premiums for fifty-year-olds have increased more than 50 percent,\u201d writes health care expert Robert Moffit in a new report.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t take a medical degree to see that Obamacare is ailing. The sooner it\u2019s repealed, the better.\n\nEd Feulner is founder of the Heritage Foundation (heritage.org).", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"Is the Affordable Care Act Working?\" reads a recent headline in The New York Times.
