I steel myself for criticism. People are overt in their dislike of my profession, but I must politely refute a worrying amount of misinformation.\n\nI laugh off the accusation that fracking will inevitably poison the entire population. \u201cI really don\u2019t think anyone in Clapham is going to be setting fire to the water coming out of their taps,\u201d I tell you, adding, \u201cNo, your house isn\u2019t going to tumble into some newly created abyss.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with solar energy?\u201d you say, accusingly. But I don\u2019t see any solar panels on the roof of your house and I know the 4x4 in the driveway doesn\u2019t run off a wind turbine.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s the start of a slippery slope,\u201d you add, raising a glass to lipstick-red lips and flicking your glossy hair. I\u2019d like to point out that your creature comforts mostly stem from fossil fuels \u2013 toiletries and cosmetics as well as clothes and transport. But I still want to have a social life.\n\n\u201cYes, there are risks,\u201d I could say. \u201cBut there are risks to everything in life.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was an application to frack in the village where my mother lives,\u201d you tell me, as if it\u2019s a personal affront to your mother. And I could admit that nobody, not even the directors of energy companies who live in the leafy home counties, wants increased industrial activity in their back yard.\n\nIf the Russians decide to cut off the gas supply and the country is plunged into darkness, I wonder if people will still treat me like some sort of social pariah?\n\n\u2022 Tell us what you\u2019re really thinking at mind@theguardian.com", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#005689", "description": "\u2018\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with solar energy?\u201d you say, accusingly.
