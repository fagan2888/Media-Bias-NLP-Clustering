It\u2019s the bills.\n\n\u201cThink of those old horror flicks,\u201d she says. \u201cThe swamp creature \u2026 comes out and is kind of oozy, and it oozes over everything.\u201d\n\nKoller, who lives in the Cleveland suburb of Strongsville, just turned 65 years old. She is petite and sports a stylish auburn wig. When she was able to work, Koller was in the corporate world and safely middle-class, with health insurance and plenty of savings.\n\nBut when she got sick, her high deductible health plan soon became a burden. And her monthly premiums kept increasing, reaching nearly double her mortgage payment. She soon found herself unable to keep up with the bills. They piled up.\n\n\u201cYou start looking at these bills,\u201d Koller says, \u201cand, as much as you know it\u2019s expensive, the shock itself is like, \u2018What?'\u201d\n\nHer response was to begin asking her doctors about the cost of the treatments they recommended and whether there was a less expensive alternative.\n\nMiddle-income patients are \u2014 more than ever \u2014 feeling the pressure of that financial burden, says Dr. Neal Meropol, an oncologist at University Hospitals in Cleveland. He took over Koller\u2019s care a couple of years ago.\n\n\u201cPatients are weighing this in their calculus now,\u201d Meropol says.\n\n[Also: See where the Medicare Shared Savings Program ACOs are]\n\nHe blames high-deductible health plans and soaring prices for a new generation of drug therapies that came onto the market in the late 1990s.\n\n\u201cWe went from drugs that cost a few hundred dollars for a course of therapy that might be a month or six months or a year, to drugs that were costing $10,000 a month,\u201d Meropol says.\n\nTotal cost of cancer care in the United States is projected to reach more than $150 billion by 2020, according to the National Cancer Institute. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a study last year that found that, compared to people without a cancer diagnosis, cancer survivors are less likely to work and more likely to struggle financially. Another study, out of Washington state, found that the longer a cancer patient survived, the higher the rate of bankruptcy.\n\nUniversity of Chicago\u2019s Dr. Jonas de Souza argues that it\u2019s time for oncologists to begin considering the financial consequences as a real side effect to cancer care.\n\n\u201cWe talk about hair loss,\u201d de Souza says. \u201cWe talk about numbness and tingling in the hands and feet. We talk about, \u2018This chemotherapy will cause low blood counts.\u2019 Right. Should we also be talking about, \u2018Well, this chemotherapy is expensive?\u2019 \u201d\n\nHe and Meropol are part of a growing field of researchers studying the impact of costs for cancer patients.\n\nAnne Koller will tell you cancer does cause financial stress.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s what happens,\u201d Koller says. \u201cI was talking about that swamp thing \u2026 but you know, OK, you go to collections. You end up with a court thing. I had been talking to the hospital, asking for help \u2014 nothing, nothing. Finally, they went to a sliding payment scale.\u201d\n\nFollow Healthcare Finance on Twitter and LinkedIn.\n\nHer credit is ruined. So she continues to drive an old car. Small expenses, like an Internet connection, are out of the question. And there are other challenges.\n\n\u201cSocially, things change a lot,\u201d she says. \u201cYou talk to people and, if you dare, say, \u2018God, you know, I can\u2019t afford this,\u2019 for instance.\u201d And there is little money for niceties, she said. If someone suggests, \u201c\u2018Let\u2019s go out to lunch,\u2019 on the day you can eat. You \u2026 think twice about it.\u201d\n\nKoller says she wishes more financial information had been given earlier in her treatments. She is now using the very last of her savings to pay bills \u2014 and, still, some are going unpaid.\n\nThis story is part of a reporting partnership that includes WCPN/Ideastream, NPR and Kaiser Health News.\n\nKaiser Health News is a national health policy news service.
