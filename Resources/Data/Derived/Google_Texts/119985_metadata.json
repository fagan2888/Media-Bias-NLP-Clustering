She said Alonso abruptly resigned from the cast Friday after the backlash.Her removal comes after numerous Latino organizations criticized her involvement in the ad, which was released Monday, for reinforcing negative stereotypes, Fox News Latino reports Donnelly has long been a strong opponent of illegal immigration and founded a state chapter of the Minutemen, a group that patrols the border with Mexico to catch illegal immigrants.\u201cPoliticians and big government are killing our prosperity, pushing welfare costs through the roof and driving our schools into the ground,\u201d Donnelly said in the ad.Alonso, who is of Cuban and Venezuelan descent, is seen standing next to Donnelly as she translates his lines into Spanish.

Doing what she is doing is against what we believe.\u201d\u201cWe don\u2019t act like that. First of all, that is not a typical Latina,\u201d Jim Salinas, former president of the San Francisco Latino Democratic Club, told the TV station. He said there probably would have been boycotts if Alonso had stayed in the play\u2019s cast.\u201cThe Tim Donnelly ad with Maria Conchito Alonso ad is so bad it\u2019s almost laughable,\u201d said a statement by Latino Republican group Caf\u00e9 Con Leche, Fox reports, adding that it \u201cinsults the intelligence of many Hispanic voters.\u201dBut some felt Alonso was treated unfairly.\u201cIt was a political ad, it was a funny ad,\u201d said Leo Lacayo, a prominent San Francisco Latino Republican. \u201cThat anybody would lose employment over what their political leanings are is absurd.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "maria conchita alonso,tea,party,candidate", "pubdate": "2014-01-18T11:26:22", "og": {"site_name": "Newsmax", "description": "Actress Maria Conchita Alonso is out of the cast of a controversial play after publicly supporting a tea party candidate's campaign for governor of California.
