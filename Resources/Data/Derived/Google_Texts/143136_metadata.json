That combination was so powerful that he is still one of the world's highest-paid athletes more than a decade after playing in his last NBA game.\n\nWith his income from endorsement deals and royalties from his namesake Jordan brand, a subsidiary of Nike, Jordan made $100 million in 2014, according to Kurt Badenhausen of Forbes.\n\nThat is more than any other athlete, active or retired, makes in endorsements. It is also enough to rank Jordan as the third-highest-paid athlete in the world, behind only Floyd Mayweather Jr. and Manny Pacquiao.\n\nThis also means, as pointed out by ESPN's Patrick Dorsey, that Jordan now makes more in a single year than he did in his entire 15-year NBA career,according to Basketball Reference.\n\nRelated: How Michael Jordan Made His $1 Billion\n\nMichael Jordan's 2015 endorsement earnings: ~$100 million\n\nMichael Jordan's career earnings in the NBA: ~$94 million\n\nThings look a little different if we adjust Jordan's earnings for inflation, as his career NBA earnings would translate to about $145 million in 2015.
