Simon served as Vice President Al Gore's top domestic policy adviser in the 1990s and is a leukemia survivor.\n\n\u2014 Biden will be at Seattle's Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center today as part of his \"listening tour.\"\n\nGOOD MORNING, IT'S MONDAY PULSE \u2014 Where we're suffering withdrawal after four straight days of March Madness. Send tips and cures to ddiamond@politico.com or @ddiamond on Twitter.\n\nSIX YEARS AGO TODAY \u2026 The House of Representatives passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act by a 219-212 vote.\n\nSTATE WEEK: CALIFORNIA's EXCHANGE GETTING AGGRESSIVE ON PROVIDER NETWORKS \u2014 Covered California wants to drop hospitals from its networks based on poor performance or high costs, California Healthline reports. The move is being proposed as a way to improve the delivery system, Rachana Pradhan and Brianna Ehley report in the new edition of State Week: http://politico.pro/1T3VHk2\n\n\u2026 Meanwhile, Louisiana may inject some conservative elements \u2014 like copays and work referrals \u2014 into its Medicaid expansion. Louisiana lawmakers are exploring potential legislation for the current session but officials in Gov. John Bel Edwards' administration say expansion is still on track for a July 1 rollout.\n\nWE WATCHED; NO HEALTH POLICY ON SUNDAY \u2014 For the first time in weeks, perennial hot-button issues like Obamacare and Medicaid expansion were a non-topic on the Sunday shows. The most extended riff on health care? When Face the Nation host John Dickerson asked Sen. Lindsey Graham about his health, after Graham compared endorsing Sen. Ted Cruz to being poisoned.\n\nCOULD ZIKA BE AMERICA's SUMMER PANIC? \u2014 If the mosquito-borne virus linked to birth defects hits big - and that's a big if - it could stir a panic like Ebola, set off an epidemic of finger-pointing and create new fear and acrimony over reproductive rights, global warming and immigration, all at the height of a presidential campaign, Arthur Allen writes. The story for Pros: http://politico.pro/1PkTXfr\n\n\u2014 CDC on Saturday issued a travel advisory that Zika is now spreading to people in Cuba. The agency has repeatedly warned that the virus is spreading in the Caribbean; CDC previously said that it expects one-quarter of Puerto Rico residents to contract Zika.\n\n\u2014 The World Health Organization on Friday called for new pilots to test ways of tampering with Zika-carrying mosquitoes. Two proposals: Releasing males genetically modified to sire mosquitos that die young, and releasing insects that carry bacteria that cause eggs not to hatch.\n\nFAH CONCERNED ABOUT RISE OF 'SKINNY' PLANS \u2014 In a letter sent to the heads of CMS and the IRS, the Federation of American Hospitals says it's worried about the growth of health plans that exclude coverage for outpatient care.\n\n\"FAH brought the issue to the attention of the Obama Administration back in 2014 and today reiterated its call for patients to be protected by [ensuring] full access to hospital inpatient and outpatient services,\" an FAH blog post to be published today will say.\n\n\"If the proliferation of these plans continues it could mean troubling results for patients and for healthcare delivery in our nation.\"\n\n** A message from National Community Pharmacists Association (NCPA): More transparency is needed into generic drug pricing and reimbursement rates set by drug plan middlemen. Bipartisan legislation (H.R. 244) would enhance oversight of federal health programs and help ensure pharmacy reimbursement for generic drugs reflects market fluctuations.

Jan Schakowsky pushed an NFL executive to admit \u2014 for the first time \u2014 that there's a connection between playing football and suffering from brain disease. Schakowsky shared her strategy with me, and here's the story for Pros: politico.pro/1Rp5VMt\n\nSpeaking with PULSE, concussion advocates and researchers applauded how Schakowsky pinned down NFL executive Jeff Miller, after the league denied the link for nearly two decades. \"I don't think it was the plan of the NFL for the first time to admit the link when in front of Congress and live on C-SPAN,\" said Chris Nowinski, cofounder of the Concussion Legacy Foundation. \"The truth slipped out.\"\n\nON TAP TODAY \u2014 The National Coalition on Health Care is hosting a 10:30 a.m. briefing in the Russell building on the rising costs of health coverage, moderated by John Rother. In attendance: Paul Ginsburg of Brookings, Sara Collins of the Commonwealth Fund, AFL-CIO's Damon Silvers, and Milliman's Scott Weltz.\n\nWHAT WE'RE READING\n\nIndiana's alternate approach to Medicaid expansion imposes fees and other complexity on enrollees, but it's not clear if the experiment is working to save money or make participants healthier, Phil Galewitz reports. http://wapo.st/1SccMWG\n\nJohnson & Johnson has settled nearly 70 lawsuits or legal claims \u2014 with dozens more still in progress \u2014 that allege J&J's now-discontinued morcellators spread cancer. http://on.wsj.com/1R9gvVS\n\nWhat are the trade-offs of expanding Medicaid through Section 1115 waivers? Writing in Health Affairs, Rachel Sachs takes a look: http://bit.ly/1RvYJrU\n\nGeorgia's Piedmont Healthcare just got a $75 million donation \u2014 the second-largest gift ever given to a community hospital \u2014 with the goal of creating a regional heart center that rivals the Cleveland Clinic. http://bit.ly/1MiSQlR\n\nThe man who volunteered to run public relations for Martin Shkreli spills his secrets. http://bit.ly/1pW6KQF\n\n** A message from National Community Pharmacists Association (NCPA): While approximately 80 percent of prescription drugs dispensed are generic drugs, the reimbursement system for these medications is largely unregulated and a mystery to pharmacists and patients. The lack of transparency also raises questions as to whether drug plan middlemen, pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) corporations, are overpaid by Medicare and other federal health programs. Moreover, when generic drug prices spike, PBM corporations are slow to update reimbursement rates, leaving community pharmacies with payments that don\u2019t cover costs and unsustainable financial losses. H.R. 244 would increase transparency and facilitate timely payment updates.
