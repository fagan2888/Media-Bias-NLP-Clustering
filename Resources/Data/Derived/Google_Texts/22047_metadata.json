Moreover, in places where Obamacare is not succeeding, it\u2019s also clear that the right wing is to blame. Well, it\u2019s clear to any who look at the state-by-state numbers of the newly insured. A whole lot of Americans will have to look, however, for the program\u2019s success to redound to Democrats\u2019 advantage.\n\nCharles Gaba, an enterprising Web site designer, has taken it upon himself to track the number of Americans who have gained health insurance under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Tallying those who have signed up on the state and federal exchanges (2.1 million), those who have obtained Medicaid coverage (4.4 million) and those who gained coverage through the law\u2019s requirement that private plans allow parents to cover their children up to age 26 (3.1 million), he cites more than 9 million newly insured through Obamacare.\n\nThe meaning of that number is, to be sure, a little fuzzy. To begin, it\u2019s a gross, not a net, increase. Some of the 2.1 million who purchased insurance on exchanges did so after their previous plans were altered or canceled. In some states, the increase in those insured through Medicaid does not distinguish between those not eligible previously and those who are simply renewing coverage.\n\nAll that said, whether the total is 9 million or 7 million, it\u2019s a big number and it\u2019s rising rapidly: December sign-ups far exceeded those in November, and the number is expected to continue growing through 2014.\n\nWhether you can access the benefits of the ACA, however, depends on where you live. In states that set up their own exchanges and accepted federal funding for Medicaid expansion, the increase in the number of insured vastly exceeds that in states that declined to do either.\n\n1 of 42 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 Tom Toles on health care View Photos A collection of cartoons on the debate.

In the 23 states that refused to establish insurance exchanges, refused to cooperate in making the federal Web site easily accessible and declined to expand Medicaid, exchange purchases were just 5.6 percent of the projected increase and Medicaid enrollments just 1.5 percent. (The 13 states that partially embraced the programs generally had increases lower than the 14 full implementers but higher than the 23 refusniks.)\n\nWhich is to say, the ACA is working as planned, perhaps a little better, in the states where governors and legislatures chose to implement it, such as California and New York. It is barely working in those states where governors and legislators have refused to implement it, such as Texas. Although the number of states declining any participation probably will diminish over time, as the tea party\u2019s grip on the Republican Party wanes or as older white conservative voters die off, the resulting red-blue division between the states probably will be a feature of the nation\u2019s political economy for some time.\n\nConsider the implications: A larger share of Californians will be able to afford regular medical check-ups than Texans. A smaller share of Californians is likely to be bankrupted by the expense of major medical treatment than Texans. When the law\u2019s tax penalties take effect, a smaller share of Californians will be subject to the penalties that come with the individual mandates than will Texans. In the coming years, a smaller share of California hospitals will face financial risk for indigent care than hospitals in Texas, where fewer of the sick and poor will be covered by Medicaid.\n\nThe conservative argument that the ACA is a disaster is true only when it\u2019s a self-fulfilling prophecy: Most of the negative consequences that right-wingers have warned against have occurred only in those places where right-wingers have subverted implementation of the law. What supporters of the ACA must keep in mind, however, is that Americans who live in states where implementation has been stymied may continue to see the act as a failure and continue to blame President Obama and his party.\n\nOnly by publicizing the act\u2019s manifest success in states where it has been implemented can supporters begin to change the public\u2019s verdict.\n\nRead more from Harold Meyerson\u2019s archive or follow him on Twitter.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "harold meyerson, washington post meyerson, harold meyerson column, charles gaba, theda skocpol, harvard theda skocpol, how many americans have enrolled in obamacare, obamacare enrollees, state insurance exchanges, federal insurance exchanges, affordable care act implementation, red states obamacare, blue states obamacare, texas obamacare, california obamacare, affordable care act medicaid expansion, federal funding medicaid expansion, kaiser medicaid commission, congressional budget office affordable care act projections", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "And those who support Affordable Care Act need to make that clear.", "title": "Harold Meyerson: Despite the critics, Obamacare works", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/harold-meyerson-despite-the-critics-obamacare-works/2014/01/08/bad2227a-77d3-11e3-af7f-13bf0e9965f6_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/WashingtonPost/Content/Blogs/ezra-klein/Images/Health_Overhaul_Disparities-08b91-084.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@HaroldMeyerson"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/harold-meyerson-despite-the-critics-obamacare-works/2014/01/08/bad2227a-77d3-11e3-af7f-13bf0e9965f6_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "harold meyerson, washington post meyerson, harold meyerson column, charles gaba, theda skocpol, harvard theda skocpol, how many americans have enrolled in obamacare, obamacare enrollees, state insurance exchanges, federal insurance exchanges, affordable care act implementation, red states obamacare, blue states obamacare, texas obamacare, california obamacare, affordable care act medicaid expansion, federal funding medicaid expansion, kaiser medicaid commission, congressional budget office affordable care act projections", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "eomportal-uuid": "bad2227a-77d3-11e3-af7f-13bf0e9965f6", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "description": "And those who support Affordable Care Act need to make that clear."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd94f0\"", "article_summary": "Some of the 2.1 million who purchased insurance on exchanges did so after their previous plans were altered or canceled.\nDespite the treasured right-wing talking points, it\u2019s increasingly clear that Obamacare is a success.\nMoreover, in places where Obamacare is not succeeding, it\u2019s also clear that the right wing is to blame.\nIn some states, the increase in those insured through Medicaid does not distinguish between those not eligible previously and those who are simply renewing coverage.\nA whole lot of Americans will have to look, however, for the program\u2019s success to redound to Democrats\u2019 advantage."}
