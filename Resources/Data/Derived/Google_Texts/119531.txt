DES MOINES, Iowa â€” The man charged for arson that occured in Oskaloosa on Monday is now back in police custody.

An arrest warrant was issued for 23-year-old Danny Logan of Oskaloosa on Wednesday, after being charged with arson in the first degree, according to the Oskaloosa Police Department.

Logan was treated at an Oskaloosa hospital for burns following the incident, before being transferred to Iowa City. He was then allowed to check out of the hospital because police failed to issue the arrest warrant in time.

Logan was later picked up by authorities at about 8:30 p.m. on Wednesday in Des Moines.

The charges stem from an investigation into a fire that occurred around 2 a.m. on May 11 in the 200 Block of 1st Avenue East in Oskaloosa.
