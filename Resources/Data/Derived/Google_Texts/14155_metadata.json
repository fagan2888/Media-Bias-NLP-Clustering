One of the most powerful lobbying groups in the country, it was a strong backer of the president\u2019s signature health care law, the Affordable Care Act.\n\nPeople are eligible for AARP membership on their 50th birthday, even though most Americans do not retire until their mid-60s. But you do not need to be a retiree to join, and getting the group\u2019s membership offer, for some, triggers dark humor about the inexorable march of time and the ravages of age.\n\nThe first lady is an example of how youthful people still are at 50, said AARP chief executive Barry Rand.\n\n\u201cNot only is Mrs. Obama helping to change and reshape the way people look at aging in this country, but she\u2019s also showing folks how great 50 looks today,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re proud to be able to call her a member of the AARP family and know that she will continue to set a great example to all by showing that age sets no boundaries on what you can achieve in life,\u201d Rand said.\n\nThe group has not always been on the same page as the administration. It previously called one of the president\u2019s budget proposals to rein in the costs of retiree programs by linking benefit increases to a less generous measure of inflation \u201cirresponsible.\u201d\n\nMichelle Obama\u2019s 50th birthday has drawn additional public scrutiny to the first lady, previously a lawyer and a hospital executive, who has used her White House position to launch a campaign called \u201cLet\u2019s Move,\u201d to fight childhood obesity.\n\nIn an interview with People magazine, she said that she aspires to remain fit and active into her 70s and 80s.\n\nAsked what she thought about Botox or plastic surgery, she said she could not envision such procedures for herself, but that she has learned to \u201cnever say never.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Michelle Obama on Friday celebrated a rite of passage for Americans turning 50: getting a membership card to AARP, a national organization that promotes the interests of older people.
