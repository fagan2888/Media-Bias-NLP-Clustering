In spite of \u201call the king\u2019s horses\u201d (insurance brokers, insurance carrier experts, pharmacy benefit management professionals and even the State\u2019s oversight committee) and \u201call of the king\u2019s men\u201d (city and labor management) this mastermind team couldn\u2019t put Humpty together again.\n\nBut wait \u2013 Humpty doesn\u2019t have to fall off the metaphorical healthcare wall! What if Paterson could do it all over again? What if the King\u2019s horses actually applied best practice methods to its ways of managing a health plan? What if the taxpayer\u2019s actually had a say in the matter? Perhaps Humpty would never have fallen off the healthcare wall!\n\nIn spite of working with Horizon, a \u201cleading\u201d health insurance carrier; USI, a top-10 nationally-ranked health insurance broker; Citizen\u2019s Rx (a national pharmacy benefit manager), and the New Jersey Department of Community Affairs, this \u201cbest thinking\u201d approach produced a very unexpected $7.4M bill \u2013 a very bitter pill to swallow!\n\nIronically, this news coincides with Horizon\u2019s newest advertising campaign emphasizing how Horizon better understands the solution (to reduce costly insurance). In the spirit of Clara Peller (Wendy\u2019s commercial circa 1995), \u201cWhere\u2019s the cost savings beef?\u201d Well, wake up Paterson taxpayers \u2013 there is no beef! Beefy savings can only be realized when stakeholders do any combination of the following:\n\n1) Make the medical and pharmacy plans less generous by raising member out-of-pocket costs, eliminating the highest cost providers, encouraging members to use center-of excellence facilities, removing high-cost biotech drugs and emphasizing the usage of pricing transparency to name a few.\n\n2) Audit the medical and prescription drug claims to recapture overpayments\n\n3) Identify data-driven cost savings through claims-based analytics, and\n\n4) Verify the eligibility of each spouse, domestic partner and dependent child to eliminate the cost of erroneously paying for their claims.\n\nIf management truly wanted to plug the financial leak it could easily reduce costs by three to eight percent. In the case of Paterson\u2019s plan, this translates to $1.5 million to $4 million in annual savings. How is this possible? A few examples follow:\n\nSavings Example 1 \u2013 Simply by verifying the eligibility of all enrolled spouses, domestic partners and dependent children, this would likely remove about eight percent of the dependent population. Assuming 2,200 dependents, this translates to annual, recurring savings exceeding $800,000 (176 ineligible dependents times $5,000 per capita).\n\nSavings Example 2 \u2013 Simply by removing all working spouses that have other insurance available to them, the plan could enjoy annual recurring savings of $2.5 million. Not only does Obamacare permit this, but this is quickly becoming an industry accepted best practice.\n\nSavings Example 3 \u2013 Simply by identifying employee-based eligibility leaks, the plan could save an additional $500,000 or more. It is important to note most plans have leaks of at least one to two percent. This is often caused by untimely termination notifications or allowing employees to get benefits after their COBRA has expired.\n\nPaterson stakeholders have a genuine opportunity to re-write its story. Humpty Dumpty doesn\u2019t have to fall and give the tax payers a $7.4 million (and growing) bill. Not only can the Paterson health plan stay on the wall, but it has the opportunity to realize the $2 million in savings management originally hoped to realize after it implements some of these best practice health care cost management programs.\n\nHoward Gerver\n\nWayne, NJ\n\nGerver is the President of HR Best Practices, a NJ-based healthcare cost management firm formed in 2001.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "As we learn more about Paterson\u2019s health care budget problems the story of Humpty Dumpty comes to mind.
