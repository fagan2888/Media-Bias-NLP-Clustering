AP/Matilde Campodonico\n\nEvery week the Truthdig editorial staff selects a Truthdigger of the Week, a group or person worthy of recognition for speaking truth to power, breaking the story or blowing the whistle. It is not a lifetime achievement award. Rather, we\u2019re looking for newsmakers whose actions in a given week are worth celebrating.\n\nThe world\u2019s \u201chumblest\u201d president, the \u201cpoorest president\u201d in terms of personal wealth, the \u201cmost radical.\u201d How did one man earn so many superlative epithets?\n\nThe 79-year-old Uruguayan President Jos\u00e9 Mujica\u2014who leaves office at the end of next month\u2014is at first glance an unlikely head of state. In keeping with the approach he developed while imprisoned for 14 years as a leftist Tupamaro urban guerrilla, Mujica repudiates materialism. Although the Broad Front party leader has been president of the now booming Latin American country since 2010, you won\u2019t see him boasting the trappings of power that other world leaders embrace. His clothes are simple, his home is a \u201cramshackle\u201d flower farm he refused to leave for the fully staffed presidential palace. His car, which for a long time was his only physical asset, is a plain 1987 Volkswagen Beetle. But while these superficial facts may have indeed earned \u201cEl Pepe\u201d a superlative or two, it\u2019s what he\u2019s done during his five-year term that has won him the hearts of his people as well as other nations\u2019 respect.\n\nThe act that gained him the title \u201cthe poorest president in the world\u201d was his decision to donate 90 percent of his monthly $12,000 presidential salary to charities, largely organizations that assist single mothers. His donations, which have totaled $550,000, brought his salary down to the Uruguayan average of roughly $775 per month. Though there are ways Mujica could make a bit of spare change, such as charging rent to the 14 other people who live on his farmland, he\u2019s simply uninterested in doing so. \u201cI\u2019m called \u2018the poorest president,\u2019 \u201d he says, \u201cbut I don\u2019t feel poor. Poor people are those who only work to try to keep an expensive lifestyle, and always want more and more.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Square, Site wide\n\n\u201cThis is a matter of freedom,\u201d he continues. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have many possessions then you don\u2019t need to work all your life like a slave to sustain them, and therefore you have more time for yourself.\u201d And yet, the once revolutionary militant says he doesn\u2019t reject capitalism\u2014on the contrary, he \u201cneeds [it] to work.\u201d In a move that some of his former compa\u00f1eros on the left criticize him for, Mujica has become a democratic socialist. But his reason for embracing the economic system that has been blamed for growing wealth gaps across the globe is based on noble and pragmatic reasons in the president\u2019s mind. \u201cI have to levy taxes,\u201d Mujica told The Guardian in a recent interview, \u201cto attend to the serious problems we have. Trying to overcome it all too abruptly condemns the people you are fighting for to suffering, so that instead of more bread, you have less bread.\u201d\n\nUnder Mujica and his predecessor, Tabar\u00e9 V\u00e1squez, who not only also belongs to the Broad Front party but will replace Mujica when he finishes his term March 1, the nation has witnessed an economic boom fueled by the agricultural industry and a dramatic decrease in poverty from 40 to 12 percent in the past 10 years. The minimum wage has increased by 50 percent and the Uruguayan wealth gap has narrowed. Moreover, the 75 percent increase in the economy has allowed for social spending to expand, money that has gone in part toward funding education and has, for example, allowed every schoolchild to have his or her own laptop computer. Mujica has also focused on enacting environmentally friendly policies and limiting consumption, an approach consistent with the speech he gave at the 2012 Rio+20 Summit in which he stated, \u201cWe can almost recycle everything now. If we lived within our means\u2014by being prudent\u2014the 7 billion people in the world could have everything they needed. Global politics should be moving in that direction.\u201d\n\nBut not all of the Broad Front leader\u2019s policies have been as welcome as free laptops. Mujica has also approved controversial legislation, such as the legalization of gay marriage and of abortions during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. Perhaps most controversially, under his rule Uruguay became the first country to legalize the production and sale of marijuana. Mujica explains that in his view the true dangers of drugs lie in trafficking, not consumption. The quixotic president, who says he has never smoked cannabis, explains that the approach to narcotics in Latin America for the past 80 years has failed and that his government has instead decided to regulate marijuana sales, which \u201cnaturally, has to be done by the state.\u201d He adds, \u201cWe want to take users out of hiding and create a situation where we can say: \u2018You are overdoing it. You have to deal with that.\u2019 It is a question of limits.\u201d\n\nDespite the waves the marijuana law has caused in his own country, Mujica has pressed more developed nations to follow in Uruguay\u2019s footsteps and adjust their drug policies. This bold advice isn\u2019t the only instance in which the \u201cworld\u2019s most radical president,\u201d as he\u2019s been called, has stood up to his counterparts and demanded a sweeping change. Mujica, in fact, played a crucial role in the recent shift in relations between the United States and Cuba, having urged several times that President Barack Obama revise American policy toward Cuba; the Uruguayan has also offered to take in a number of detainees held in Guantanamo Bay to speed up the detention center\u2019s closure. Mujica doesn\u2019t stop at dealing forthrightly with fellow presidents. He has continued to be a vocal critic of tobacco, calling it a \u201ckiller,\u201d despite the fact that cigarette giant Philip Morris is suing Uruguay over its legislation requiring warning labels on tobacco products and prohibiting smoking in public areas. As far as other international disagreements go, despite his once militant approach to politics the Uruguayan president \u201cprofesses a hatred for modern war, but also scorns \u2018beatific pacifism.\u2019 \u201d In this sense, he has come a long way from the past that shaped him, although, evidenced by his sometimes colorful use of language and his propensity to stand up to bullies, he hasn\u2019t lost the revolutionary spunk that inspired him to join the Tupamaro guerrilla movement (also known as the Movimiento de Liberaci\u00f3n Nacional, or MLN) in the 1960s when his country was turning increasingly corrupt.\n\nThough Mujica says he avoided violence whenever possible, the MLN, once called \u201cRobin Hood guerrillas\u201d for their history of hijacking food delivery trucks to distribute their loot to slums, eventually became intensely violent when faced with an aggressive government response. The movement went from robbing banks to expose corruption to leading what was described as a terrorist campaign of kidnappings and even targeted bombings. Some critics have gone so far as to blame the rise of the Uruguayan dictatorship in the 1970s on the Tupamaros. In the eyes of these critics, it was the government\u2019s knee-jerk response to guerrilla violence that caused authorities to call on the military and ultimately led to a military coup. Today Mujica, who was shot six times by police, was tortured and spent the entire dictatorship in solitary confinement, has no regrets about his actions. He says he didn\u2019t hide his past during his presidential campaign nor does he turn away from it now, and though he says he wasn\u2019t elected for being a Tupamaro he also admits, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be the person I am if I hadn\u2019t lived through those years [in prison].\u201d He expresses a similarly philosophical sentiment about his torturers, saying he holds no hard feelings against them, because they were merely \u201cinstruments in other people\u2019s hands.\u201d\n\nUnder Uruguayan law presidents cannot serve a second consecutive five-year term, but Mujica says this limitation is no source of displeasure for him. After he leaves the presidency he plans to spend more time with his wife, former Tupamaro fighter Luc\u00eda Topolansky, and Manuela, his three-legged dog, while resuming his seat in the country\u2019s senate. After Mujica leaves office it will be easy for his admirers to give in to nostalgia and obsess about his plucky and progressive presidency, but that\u2019s not what the \u201cworld\u2019s humblest president\u201d wants. Just last week, after thousands of his fans planned to organize an homage to the outgoing president, \u201cEl Pepe\u201d publicly pleaded that they refrain because, in his words, this is a time to look \u201cforwards, not backwards.\u201d He asked his supporters to share their addresses with him via social media so he could arrange to meet with them under different circumstances; after all, he said, \u201cI like smaller reunions better.\u201d For his continued humility, his courageous efforts in the fight against inequality and his eccentric yet sincere approach to leadership, Jos\u00e9 Mujica is our Truthdigger of the Week.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "jose mujica, jos\u00e9 mujica, lucia topolansky, marijuana legalization, mujica, mujica cuba, mujica green policy, mujica marijuana, mujica politics, mujica poorest president, south america, tupamaro, uruguay, uruguay marijuana, uruguay mujica, uruguayan politics", "og": {"site_name": "Truthdig", "description": "The Uruguayan president, who will leave office soon, has an offbeat but sincere approach that has won the hearts of his people and the respect of foreigners.\n - 2015/01/18", "title": "Truthdigger of the Week: Jos\u00e9 Mujica: Natasha Hakimi", "url": "http://www.truthdig.com/report/item/truthdigger_of_the_week_jose_mujica_20150118", "image": {"width": 360, "identifier": "http://www.truthdig.com/images/eartothegrounduploads/eljosemujica_360.jpg", "height": 254}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Uruguayan president, who will leave office soon, has an offbeat but sincere approach that has won the hearts of his people and the respect of foreigners.", "title": "Truthdigger of the Week: Jos\u00e9 Mujica | Truthdig: Drilling Beneath the Headlines", "url": "http://www.truthdig.com/report/item/truthdigger_of_the_week_jose_mujica_20150118/", "image": {"width": 360, "identifier": "http://www.truthdig.com/images/eartothegrounduploads/eljosemujica_360.jpg", "height": 254}, "creator": "@truthdig", "site": "@truthdig"}, "fb": {"app_id": 319814091404244}, "keywords": "Truthdig, Truthdigger of the Week: Jos\u00e9 Mujica, jose mujica, jos\u00e9 mujica, lucia topolansky, marijuana legalization, mujica, mujica cuba, mujica green policy, mujica marijuana, mujica politics, mujica poorest president, south america, tupamaro, uruguay, uruguay marijuana, uruguay mujica, uruguayan politics", "article": {"tag": "jose mujica, jos\u00e9 mujica, lucia topolansky, marijuana legalization, mujica, mujica cuba, mujica green policy, mujica marijuana, mujica politics, mujica poorest president, south america, tupamaro, uruguay, uruguay marijuana, uruguay mujica, uruguayan politics", "published_time": "2015-01-18T06:58:49-08:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-18T17:00:50-08:00"}, "description": "The Uruguayan president, who will leave office soon, has an offbeat but sincere approach that has won the hearts of his people and the respect of foreigners.\n - 2015/01/18"}, "article_summary": "The 79-year-old Uruguayan President Jos\u00e9 Mujica\u2014who leaves office at the end of next month\u2014is at first glance an unlikely head of state.\nBy Natasha HakimiUruguay\u2019s President Jos\u00e9 Mujica is not your run-of-the-mill leader.\nIn keeping with the approach he developed while imprisoned for 14 years as a leftist Tupamaro urban guerrilla, Mujica repudiates materialism.\nThe world\u2019s \u201chumblest\u201d president, the \u201cpoorest president\u201d in terms of personal wealth, the \u201cmost radical.\u201d How did one man earn so many superlative epithets?\nAP/Matilde CampodonicoEvery week the Truthdig editorial staff selects a Truthdigger of the Week, a group or person worthy of recognition for speaking truth to power, breaking the story or blowing the whistle."}
