Crystal\u2019s medical condition is costing her more than $10,000 per year \u2013 about half of her salary \u2013 because she falls into a loophole where accepting Medicare would be unaffordable and she doesn\u2019t qualify for Affordable Care Act subsidies. Those interested in donating can contribute to the \u201cCrystal\u2019s Opportunity Fund\u201d at Evergreen Credit Union or call 650-4146.

The predicament threatens to bury her in debt while she fights for her life.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s fallen into this very unusual hole,\u201d said Dr. Marguerite Pennoyer, a Scarborough immunologist who is Goodwin\u2019s physician.\n\nGoodwin can\u2019t afford to accept Medicare because she takes numerous expensive, specialized medications that are either not covered or only partially covered by Medicare\u2019s prescription drug program. Because she\u2019s refusing Medicare, she\u2019s forbidden from obtaining subsidies on the Affordable Care Act\u2019s health insurance marketplace for which she would otherwise qualify.\n\nBoth the marketplace and Medicare are designed for those like Goodwin \u2013 low- to medium-income people who are ill and need insurance to help pay for their health care. Instead, Goodwin\u2019s health care costs will eat up \u2013 at a minimum \u2013 more than half of her annual $20,000 disability income. Faced with no other choice, she\u2019s using unsubsidized ACA marketplace insurance.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like I\u2019m in this doughnut hole,\u201d Goodwin said. \u201cNothing I do fits either program.\u201d\n\nEXPENSIVE COVERAGE OPTIONS\n\nHealth care experts say the case is puzzling, and there do not appear to be any immediate answers for Goodwin.\n\nA few months\u2019 worth of the pills, inhalers, liquid medicine and other treatments she needs filled up a laundry basket and about half of her bed when she showed them to the Press Herald recently. Those medications cost money, and she has no idea how she\u2019s going to pay her share of the price.\n\nShe\u2019s facing more than $10,000 in medical bills over the next three months, nearly half of her annual income. She needs the medications to live, and said she will soon start relying on credit card debt to avoid weekly trips to the hospital, or death. Goodwin has no way of paying the bills \u2013 she can\u2019t work because of her disability and can\u2019t obtain insurance that alleviates the costs.\n\nShe qualifies for Medicare and its prescription plan, but because her medications are so numerous and specialized, her co-pays and other shared costs would be more than $3,000 per month, according to documents she provided to the Press Herald. The $3,000 per month is only part of her costs, because while Medicare will help pay for about half of the 35 prescriptions she needs, it won\u2019t pay any costs for the other half, according to the documents.\n\n\u201cWe totaled everything up, and it came to more than $100,000 per year,\u201d said Goodwin, who was a children\u2019s mental-health worker before she qualified for disability insurance.\n\nWhen Medicare notified her in October that she qualified, she was originally \u201csuper excited.\u201d But when a letter detailed the prohibitive costs of her specialized medication, Goodwin had to decline the government program\u2019s prescription and insurance plans while maintaining Medicare\u2019s free hospitalization services.\n\nGoodwin had been receiving subsidized ACA marketplace coverage this year. Her premium was $120 per month, with a $1,500 out-of-pocket maximum.\n\nBut when she had to turn down Medicare in October, the ACA took her subsidies away, as required by law. Her premium skyrocketed to $270 per month, and on top of that she has to pay a $4,500 out-of-pocket maximum. She also pays about $200 per month for over-the-counter drugs that no insurance covers.\n\nAnnually, her total health care costs went from about $5,300 per year to $10,200 per year.\n\nTo add to her costs, when the ACA subsidized plan was canceled this fall, her unsubsidized plan was counted as new coverage, meaning she will have to immediately pay a $4,500 deductible and another one in January. Her prescription costs are so high that she meets her deductible almost immediately after insurance starts.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t pretend to understand this,\u201d said Pennoyer, Goodwin\u2019s physician. \u201cTypically, Medicare would cover these costs.\u201d\n\nGoodwin has reached out to U.S. Sen. Angus King\u2019s office for help, and King\u2019s office is in the early stages of trying to untangle the bureaucracy.\n\n\u201cWe have connected (Goodwin) with several organizations and resources, and we have also been in touch with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services on her behalf,\u201d King spokesman Scott Ogden wrote in an email. \u201cSenator King believes that every American, regardless of circumstance, deserves high-quality, affordable health insurance.\u201d\n\nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services spokeswoman Courtney Jenkins said the agency could not comment on individual cases.\n\nEmily Brostek, president of Consumers for Affordable Health Care, which also is helping Goodwin, said there is \u201cnot a lot of flexibility\u201d in the health insurance marketplace to provide subsidies for someone who declines Medicare because it\u2019s too expensive. In rare circumstances, such as a patient who needs specialized, expensive medication like Goodwin does, Medicare would be unaffordable, she said.\n\n\u201cIn a few cases, it\u2019s possible that the health insurance marketplace would provide better coverage than Medicare,\u201d said Brostek, who does not believe the current system allows for many exceptions.\n\nSUDDEN ONSET OF MANY ALLERGIES\n\nGoodwin was a healthy 26-year-old when she was hospitalized at Maine Medical Center one day in September 2011 for severe allergies, probably because of an unknown environmental trigger.\n\nAfter recovering, she kept suffering from sometimes life-threatening allergic reactions, and ended up in the hospital on average once every two weeks. Her allergic reactions range from hives to rashes to breathing difficulties to her lungs filling with fluid. She spent about a year visiting allergy specialists before being diagnosed in 2012 with mast cell activation syndrome, which has no known cure.\n\nGoodwin\u2019s allergies include latex, cigarette smoke, nuts, perfumes, household cleaners, gluten, processed food, shellfish, dust, lotions, pollen, sunlight and adhesives.\n\n\u201cIf you took out some duct tape right now, I would probably have to go to the hospital,\u201d Goodwin said. \u201cMy whole body turns red and itchy, and I can feel my lungs filling with fluid.\u201d\n\nHer condition has made it so that she can\u2019t work or do normal activities, such as go to movies or concerts or be around groups of friends. She has to avoid being near people who might unwittingly do something that could cause an allergic reaction.\n\nTreatment has reduced her hospitalizations from once every two weeks or so to about once every six weeks, but she still has to be very careful about where she goes.\n\nIt\u2019s an isolating life, Goodwin said.\n\nOne of the few places she can visit without fear is Snap Fitness in South Portland, which uses only unscented cleaners and is careful to keep potential allergens out of the 24-hour fitness facility.\n\n\u201cI treat it like my job,\u201d Goodwin said. \u201cI go here and work out for about an hour, socialize and go home. That\u2019s about all that I have energy for. I\u2019m wiped out the rest of the day.\u201d\n\nStill, the fitness center has improved Goodwin\u2019s health, from being unable to do one push-up, to cranking out 25 push-ups at one time in addition to cardiovascular and weight training.\n\nDarren Smith, a personal trainer at Snap Fitness who has become her friend, said Goodwin has become an inspiration to the staff and patrons at the fitness center.\n\n\u201cPeople are rallying behind her. Why wouldn\u2019t we help her?\u201d said Smith, who is coordinating a fundraising campaign to help pay Goodwin\u2019s medical bills.\n\nFEARFUL, RESILIENT, A FIGHTER\n\nDespite some improvements, Goodwin said her condition requires constant monitoring, and she lives in fear that she might die from one of the allergic reactions. Every time she\u2019s hospitalized, it takes her weeks to physically and mentally recover.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like every time I climb up this hill and I\u2019m partway up the hill, then this boulder comes down and I\u2019m struck down,\u201d Goodwin said. \u201cThere\u2019s still this grieving. I lost the life that I had. I\u2019m always measuring how close I am to Maine Med, because I can\u2019t be too far away.\u201d\n\nHer mother, Susan Goodwin, said Crystal is resilient and fights for her rights, medically and financially.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe we don\u2019t have a better system in place to help her,\u201d Susan Goodwin said, as her daughter made homemade applesauce, one of the few snacks she can eat. \u201cShe gets up every day with a smile on her face, doing what she has to do to be alive.\u201d\n\nCrystal Goodwin, who has saucer-shaped eyes and flashes a broad smile even when talking about difficult topics, said she\u2019s so immersed in her problems that she can\u2019t think about the future. She said finding a husband and having children, the life stages that her friends are going through, seem remote.\n\n\u201cI would be too much of a burden,\u201d Goodwin said. \u201cI don\u2019t know minute to minute how long I am going to live.\u201d\n\nGoodwin said her immediate goal now is to keep from going into debilitating debt.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a full-time job just to stay alive,\u201d she said. \u201cI am trying to be the healthiest sick person I can possibly be.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "She endures double nightmares \u2013 isolated by multiple allergies, her costly health care falls into a coverage gap that could break her financially.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "description": "She endures double nightmares \u2013 isolated by multiple allergies, her costly health care falls into a coverage gap that could break her financially.", "title": "South Portland woman with rare immune system disease struggling physically, financially - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 999, "identifier": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/536690_363294-20141023_mast-cell_5.jpg", "height": 763}, "updated_time": "2014-11-12T11:31:35-04:00", "url": "http://www.pressherald.com/2014/11/12/its-a-full-time-job-just-to-stay-alive-says-woman-with-rare-immune-system-disease/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "She endures double nightmares \u2013 isolated by multiple allergies, her costly health care falls into a coverage gap that could break her financially.", "creator": "@pressherald", "image": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/536690_363294-20141023_mast-cell_5.jpg", "title": "South Portland woman with rare immune system disease struggling physically, financially - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "site": "@pressherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=951845858", "fb": {"admins": 769488179, "app_id": 178078215650057}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pressherald", "section": "Health care", "published_time": "2014-11-12T04:00:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-12T11:31:35-04:00"}, "google-site-verification": "QWs9pxQP8fwo2-nR5mWopc6qCK2D3920f7bl-U-zkso", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb656\"", "article_summary": "Instead, Goodwin\u2019s health care costs will eat up \u2013 at a minimum \u2013 more than half of her annual $20,000 disability income.\nAnnually, her total health care costs went from about $5,300 per year to $10,200 per year.\nBecause she\u2019s refusing Medicare, she\u2019s forbidden from obtaining subsidies on the Affordable Care Act\u2019s health insurance marketplace for which she would otherwise qualify.\nFaced with no other choice, she\u2019s using unsubsidized ACA marketplace insurance.\nGoodwin can\u2019t afford to accept Medicare because she takes numerous expensive, specialized medications that are either not covered or only partially covered by Medicare\u2019s prescription drug program."}
