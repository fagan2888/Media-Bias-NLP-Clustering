And I hope there\u2019s no more,\u201d said Damgen, 88. \u201cBut it looks like it\u2019s starting up again.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe's referring to the conflicts in the Mideast, leaving Damgen worried his work will never be done.\n\nWhat James Damgen collects are news clips of the war dead. He has two shelves of binders in his West Orange apartment that contain every bit of print media information he has found on nearly a century\u2019s worth of men and women killed in action. Each person -- and there are hundreds -- has at least one memorial page.\n\nHis books covering World War I, World War II, Korea and Vietnam list and archive those from his native Montclair, with copies in the Montclair Public Library.\n\nBut he expanded his search to all New Jerseyans with the Gulf Wars, and the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts. He also has a book chronicling the people who died in the terror attacks of Sept. 11, and he plans to bequeath those binders to the New Jersey Historical Society.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s his way of expressing his patriotism,\u201d said his daughter, Jeanne Damgen. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t serve (in World War II), so this is how he does his part.\u201d\n\nHer father, known to everyone as \u201cDuke,\u201d was stricken by polio as a toddler. When the draft board called in 1943, he was all set to go, just like his brothers, a sister, friends and neighbors.\n\n\u201cBut they declared me 4-F,\u201d said Damgen. \u201cI said, \u2018Why? ' I was perfectly capable of doing a desk job. Then I tried to join the Coast Guard and they wouldn\u2019t let me in, either.\u201d\n\nIt bothered him then. And after he retired from a successful career with General Electric, selling its appliance line to retailers during the 1990s, it began to bug him all over again.\n\n\u201cHe read The Star-Ledger and Montclair Times religiously, and more and more, he saw the obituaries of his contemporaries, and how they all served in World War II,\u201d Jeanne Damgen said. \u201cHe always told us stories about his antics with his brothers, and how his polio never slowed him down. When the war came, he actually begged to serve. It always bothered him that they didn\u2019t let him.\u201d\n\nJames Damgen remembers feeling left out when he was denied entry into the military in 1943.\n\nHe also remembers when the war hit home.\n\nA cousin, Henry Damgen of Irvington, was killed in Germany. A friend, Marine Pvt. James Mulligan, died in the South Pacific.\n\nTwo of Damgen\u2019s neighbors from Montague Place in Montclair were killed days apart in the weeks after D-Day.\n\nArmy Sgt. Paul Duffy was in a tank battalion and died while fighting in France. Army Cpl. John Fikslin, a Montclair police officer who worked on the force with Damgen\u2019s father, was killed after he took part in the invasions of Sicily and Normandy.\n\n\u201cAll my friends were fighting. I felt bad I didn\u2019t go,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter Damgen left General Electric, he filled his days delving into the genealogy of his family and his wife's family. On the shelf next to the books of the war dead are binders marked Damgen, Walsh, McDermott, O\u2019Toole and Reilly, the surnames of the branches of his family tree.\n\n\u201cI started looking at newspapers back as far as 1890,\u201d Damgen said.\n\nWhen his research took him into the World War I years, he saw death notices and obituaries of Montclair men killed in action. He began to collect those clips.\n\nAt the Montclair Library, he found lists of all the service members from the town who were killed in World War I and World II, and searched its newspaper archives to collect whatever stories he could, no matter how small.\n\nSome of the death notices are brief; one paragraph with little more than name, age, rank and survivors. Others include delicate, mournful human touches that bring texture to the lives and last days of the dead service members.\n\nThe obituary for Fikslin says he was injured on July 24, 1944, and is followed by this paragraph:\n\n\u201cHis last letter home was dated July 23 and stated, \u2018I am writing this from a foxhole on the Cherbourg peninsula.\u2019 \u201d\n\nIt also notes that he was promoted to sergeant the day before he was hit.\n\nThe clip on Paul Duffy says he \u201clast wrote home on July 25, reporting \u2018the invasion was going okay.\u2019 \u201d\n\nWith the help of Montclair research librarians Kim Seltzer and William Fischer, Damgen was able to track down every bit of information on the hundreds of casualties from the town.\n\nIn his World War I binder and three World War II binders, page after page of black-and-white news clips and grainy service portraits are reminders of the tremendous loss of young life from Montclair. Part of a generation, and their future contributions to their hometown, lost forever.\n\nInformation Damgen couldn\u2019t find in Montclair, he found at the Newark Public Library and the New Jersey Historical Society.\n\n\u201cI also got a lot of help from Charles Cummings,\u201d Damgen said, remembering the late Newark historian and archivist at the city library.\n\nUtilizing the internet, Damgen also tracked down the gravesites of American soldiers buried in Europe, and included them in each person\u2019s profile.\n\nHis Montclair binders are now part of the library\u2019s permanent collection.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s such a lovely guy and has done such a great service,\u201d Seltzer said.\n\nAround Veterans Day and Memorial Day, the library displays them .\u201cI know people use them for their own family research,\u201d Demgen said.\n\nWhen he finished with Montclair books, Damgen turned his attention to the wars in the Mideast.\n\n\u201cMy father chronicled all 166 people killed in Iraq and Afghanistan,\u201d Jeanne Damgen said. \u201cHe went all over the state to track down information on them and has pictures of all but one. It\u2019s his way of honoring them.\u201d\n\nThese books have the same effect as his earlier ones: page after page of lost sons and daughters, husbands and wives, brothers and sisters -- reminders of the terrible destruction of young life in war.\n\nIn these books, though, the pictures are sharp and in color, the obituaries are more detailed and the history is modern, right up to Sept. 21 of last year, when Staff Sgt. Timothy McGill of Ramsey died in Afghanistan.\n\nHe is the last in Damgen's collection. For now.\n\n(Mark Di Ionno: (973) 392-1728 or mdiionno@starledger.com)", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "Description": "What James Damgen collects, he wishes he never had to gather. &#8220;I&#8217;ll keep working on it until there&#8217;s no more.
