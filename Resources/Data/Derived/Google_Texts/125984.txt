Review Your Current Health Insurance Plan

If you don’t have health insurance, Open Enrollment is the time to explore your options and find the best coverage. However, even if you do have coverage, it’s still important to review your current plan and reevaluate your health care needs. Your needs and your family’s needs may have changed since last year, and there may be a better plan available to you on the Marketplace.

If you’re one of the 7.1 million people who purchased coverage through the Marketplace last year, or you purchased coverage through your state-based marketplace or the GoHealth Marketplace, you may have the option to passively re-enroll by taking no action. Be warned, though: doing so might mean missing out on significant savings, ending up with a different plan that you don’t choose yourself, and even losing access to your current doctor. It’s important to evaluate your needs and browse plans before making your final decision.

Update Your Information

Enrolling through a private exchange like GoHealth means that you’ll have access to tax subsidies to reduce your monthly premiums. Tax subsidy eligibility is based on your household income and household size, so it’s important that all of your personal and household information is updated to get the most accurate estimate. Even the smallest of changes can affect the subsidy you receive.
