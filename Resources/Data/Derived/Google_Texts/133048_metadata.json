In addition, Article 2, Section 3, indicates that the president \u201cshall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed\u2026\u201d\n\nOn Saturday, Obama denied that amnesty was the result of his executive action. \u201cAmnesty is the immigration system we have today \u2014 millions of people living here without paying their taxes, or playing by the rules. And the actions I took this week will finally start fixing that,\u201d he said.\n\nIn an exchange with Fox contributor Chris Stirewalt on The Kelly File, a fired-up Megyn Kelly \u2014 who was a practicing lawyer before going into the media \u2014 posed the following rhetorical questions (see embed below) about the Obama amnesty order:\n\nHow is anybody supposed to believe anything he tells us from this point forward \u2026 Doesn\u2019t character matter, doesn\u2019t integrity matter? Honesty? I realize politicians have to spin, and they can\u2019t become president unless you\u2019re a spinner. But this is a matter of integrity. Twenty-five times on camera; either the president was knowingly misstating things for political reasons\u2013he knew he could do it but he wanted to stave off these folks who were pressuring him, so he just said he couldn\u2019t. Or he\u2019s done a complete 180 on his actual beliefs and just refuses to acknowledge that to the American people \u2026 Your word has to mean something, when you go back on it, you have to offer an explanation\u2026\u201d\n\nOn several recent broadcasts, Megyn Kelly has also blasted the administration over the Obamacare/GruberGate controversy in which one of the key architects of the Affordable Care Act repeatedly boasted on camera that the law passed in part due to the stupidity of the American public and lack of transparency in the way the measure was crafted.\n\nSeparately, when asked about the president\u2019s executive action, potential presidential candidate Ben Carson, a retired neurosurgeon, expressed support for an organized guest worker program, but noted that illegal immigration is exacerbated by the U.S. as a welfare magnet. \u201cYou have to reverse the polarity of the magnet that is attracting people here. All the goodies, you just turn those off. Then, you seal the border,\u201d Carson told Bloomberg Politics.\n\nWhether you deem it amnesty or not, do you agree or disagree with Megyn Kelly that integrity is an issue with the illegal immigration executive order given the president\u2019s past statements?\n\n[image via Debby Wong / Shutterstock.com]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Megyn Kelly slammed President Obama on Friday evening for going back on his word and granting amnesty from deportation for millions of illegal aliens.
