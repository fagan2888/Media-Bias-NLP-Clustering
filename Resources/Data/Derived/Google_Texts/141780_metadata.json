In all, the high court heard 67 cases. Many of the most significant rulings came out in just the past seven days. And some of the decisions showed surprise splits among the justices.\n\nJeffrey Brown looks at what we learned from and about the court.\n\nJEFFREY BROWN: The court\u2019s 2015 session took on a big and broad landscape, free speech, the rights of pregnant workers, housing discrimination, the use of lethal injection, and, of course, the fate of Obamacare, and the definition of marriage itself.\n\nWe take our own big and broad look with three of the country\u2019s top Supreme Court watchers, Joan Biskupic, legal affairs editor for Reuters and author of biographies of Justices Scalia and Sotomayor, Amy Howe, editor of SCOTUSblog, and, of course, our own regular contributor Marcia Coyle of \u201cThe National Law Journal,\u201d author of the book \u201cThe Roberts Court.\u201d\n\nWelcome to you all.\n\nJoan, you start us off.\n\nWas there a big theme that you saw emerge from this term?\n\nJOAN BISKUPIC, Reuters: Well, you know, we always try to isolate the courts for the one term.\n\nBut the court never sits still to just say, OK, just judge us by this term. So we have to step back a little bit. Of course, we had the upholding for the second time of President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act, which was big for so many of your viewers. We had this fundamental right to same-sex marriage declared.\n\nAnd those two sort of gave the court a little bit of liberal identification, but the truth is that this is still pretty much of a conservative court. They also upheld the lethal injection nationwide for death penalty. So I would say that we saw several things, but mostly what it comes down to is, it depends on the case, it depends on Anthony Kennedy, our traditional swing vote justice.\n\nAnd this time, he did go more with the liberals. And for the chief himself, we saw him going in both directions, but still being very consistent for himself.\n\nJEFFREY BROWN: OK, Amy, pick up on that. The chief, the key players, what do you see?\n\nAMY HOWE, SCOTUSblog.com: Well, I think it was interesting, because it\u2019s certainly true that the four liberal justices were in the majority in a lot of the important cases this term, including same-sex marriage, including Obamacare, housing discrimination.\n\nBut I wouldn\u2019t look at this as a term in which the law necessarily moved to the left, that these were actually liberal victories, as much as they were the liberals staving off efforts by the right to move the law to the right. And so same-sex marriage, undoubtedly, that was a decision that moved the law to the left.\n\nUntil last Friday, there was no nationwide right to same-sex marriage. Now there is. But when you look at a lot of the other big cases, whether you\u2019re talking about Obamacare, housing discrimination, a case involving whether or not Congress can order interest the executive branch to put Israel on the passport of U.S. citizens who were born in Jerusalem, these are all cases in which all that happened really was that the law stayed the same.\n\nJEFFREY BROWN: Status quo.\n\nAMY HOWE: Yes.\n\nJEFFREY BROWN: Marcia, you have, of course, worked us through, walked it through play by play throughout the term. Put a bigger hat on here.\n\nLet me show a couple of graphics that we have to show some of the alliances. So, the Affordable Care Act, here\u2019s the 6-3 decision in that. And then we will put up the gay marriage case, and you can see the shifts. What do you see in terms of the alliances that took place this term?\n\nMARCIA COYLE, The National Law Journal: Well, I think the alliances are what distinguished a lot of these cases.\n\nYou saw movement from justices on the right over to the left, and they were the reason that we had the victories in the same-sex marriage case, health care as well. I think we learned a lot about the court from this particular term. We learned a lot about the differences among the justices on the right and how they interpret the Constitution and how they interpret federal laws.\n\nJEFFREY BROWN: You mean the right as a bloc itself? It was interesting to watch.\n\nMARCIA COYLE: Yes.\n\nI think we \u2014 as we have said in the past, these justices on the left and the right are not monolithic blocs at all. And we saw in many of the big cases this term that the justices on the right don\u2019t march in lockstep when it comes to interpreting the Constitution.\n\nWe saw, for example, in same-sex marriage that Justice Kennedy has a broader conception of individual \u2014 individual liberty that is protected by the 14th Amendment than his \u2014 the colleagues to the right of him. And we saw in the health care case that the chief justice interprets statutes differently from Justice Scalia.\n\nJEFFREY BROWN: So, Joan, can we talk about a \u2014 we talk about a Roberts court, right? But we\u2019re saying here that that has meanings that change around.\n\nJOAN BISKUPIC: It does.\n\nAnd the chief himself was in the majority less this term than he has been in past terms. And that\u2019s another reason to remember that you judge a term by the particular cases that are up there for those nine months. And next year, we\u2019re going to have so many other different kinds of cases that, frankly, at this point might play more to the justices on the right wing.\n\nBut it\u2019s Roberts court in name. We informally give it that. In terms of winners and losers, we probably should say it\u2019s the Kennedy court, as we have said for many, many years. But just to pick up with what Marcia said about the justices on the left hanging together, Justice Ginsburg has a view that she will assign an opinion, she will write up an opinion, and they will sign it. Her colleagues will sign it.\n\nOnce you\u2019re \u2014 if you\u2019re in the dissent and you\u2019re on the right wing, they\u2019re going to naturally splinter even further than they already are. There is a lot of difference between Clarence Thomas, who is on the far right, and Anthony Kennedy, who is also on the right, much more of a difference than among at all those four justices on the liberal side.\n\nJEFFREY BROWN: I want to ask.\n\nI will start with you on this, Amy Howe, the question of the rhetoric, because it\u2019s something we all watch and you\u2019re all there in the court and reading the decisions. There\u2019s a lot of strong rhetoric this term, right? This is Glossip vs. Gross, the capital execution case, right?\n\nSo, we have Justice Scalia referring to some words by Justice Breyer as gobbledygook. Scalia is always good for\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nJEFFREY BROWN: Right.\n\nWas this unusual?\n\nAMY HOWE: It did seem a little bit unusual. Every term, by the end of the term \u2014 because, frequently, especially the last few years, that\u2019s when a lot of the high-profile cases have been coming down\n\nAnd so those are the cases on which the justices are more likely to be closely divided. They\u2019re tired of each other. They\u2019re ready for summer vacation.\n\nJEFFREY BROWN: They\u2019re normal people, like the rest of us.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nAMY HOWE: They\u2019re tired. They\u2019re tired, and they\u2019re tired of each other, because they\u2019re working so hard at the end of June.\n\nBut this session, when you had Justice Scalia in the same-sex marriage case saying that he would rather hide his head in a bag than sign on to an opinion that started the way that Justice Kennedy started his opinion in the same-sex marriage case, that\u2019s really kind of remarkable.\n\nAnd so I think there is a couple of things going on. I think that the conservatives this term were frustrated that they were on the losing side in some of these cases, particularly maybe the Obamacare, ACA subsidies case, that they probably expected to win.\n\nAnd it seemed, when I looked back at the rhetoric in some of the dissents, the rhetoric was particularly strong on the part of justices like Justices Scalia, Thomas and Alito, when it was directed at majority opinions, for example, in the same-sex marriage case, in the Obamacare case, that were written by conservatives.\n\nIt\u2019s one thing if you\u2019re Justice Scalia and you think Justice Ginsburg has written an end-driven opinion with no grounding in legal doctrine or anything like that. We kind of expect that from her, is the thinking on Justice Scalia\u2019s part.\n\nBut it\u2019s another thing when you have got Justice Kennedy or the chief justice changing sides in a case that he regards as fundamentally important.\n\nJEFFREY BROWN: What about, Marcia, now looking ahead? And Joan referred to some of these cases. There are some big cases coming.\n\nMARCIA COYLE: Yes.\n\nJEFFREY BROWN: I mean, there\u2019s always big ones, but there\u2019s big ones that could shift our whole perception again. Right?\n\nMARCIA COYLE: There are.\n\nAlready, the court has on its docket for next term a major case involving unions and agency shop fees that non-union members pay in order for the union to represent them during collective bargaining. There, it seems, sentiment on the court to find that they\u2019re unconstitutional under the First Amendment.\n\nThe court also has, once again, taken affirmative action in higher education, a case\u2026\n\nJEFFREY BROWN: Which has colleges worried again.\n\nMARCIA COYLE: Absolutely. And it\u2019s the second time for this particular case that they\u2019re going to be looking at it.\n\nThe court has a political case involving the meaning of one person, one vote, after all these years, in redistricting, and teeing up we\u2019re seeing coming now, because there have been a slew of emergency requests for stays in lower court cases involving abortion clinics, voting rights. And we may also see next term a challenge to President Obama\u2019s executive action on immigration.\n\nSo, it could be, as Joan said, an extremely different term.\n\nJEFFREY BROWN: Just a very brief last word on that? You see some real challenges?\n\nJOAN BISKUPIC: Yes. I think next year at this time, we could all be sitting around saying, what a swing to the right it was.\n\nAnd I will just mention one thing that the chief himself has said at this time of year. It\u2019s a very good thing we all get a break from each other.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nJEFFREY BROWN: All right, on that \u2014 not that I want to take a break from the three of you, but we will end there.\n\nJoan Biskupic, Amy Howe, Marcia Coyle, thanks very much.\n\nAMY HOWE: Thank you.\n\nMARCIA COYLE: Thanks, Jeff.\n\nJOAN BISKUPIC: Thanks, Jeff.", "article_metadata": {"description": "From legalizing gay marriage to upholding the Affordable Care Act, the Supreme Court has just finished up a momentous term.
