The question for today is how much are you planning to gobble-gobble? If you\u2019re hungrier for a healthier, happier, less stressful and more meaningful celebration this Thanksgiving holiday, I have some ideas to share:\n\nSense your stressors. Listen to your body \u2014 especially your gut, the seat of great wisdom. If thinking about Turkey Day makes you feel tense and weary, your body is speaking the truth: Something is wrong. Sit calmly and meditate upon the source of your stress. Painful memories? (The bird that never thawed.) Future fears? (Your son comes dressed as a zombie.) Let it all go, including your perfectionist need to model Martha Stewart. Those handcrafted John Smith meets Pocahontas centerpieces are so yesterday.\n\nReview your guest list. If you\u2019re hosting, know you can suspend tradition and eliminate toxic people from your table. But if you\u2019re stuck with guests whom are mean-spirited, self-centered or \u2014 my nemeses \u2014 gossip queens, see Thanksgiving as an opportunity to practice acceptance and compassion. Be thankful that you are evolved enough to handle their pathology. Or simply buy some pumpkin-scented place cards and seat them as far from you as possible.\n\nBe a conscious cook. This year ban the Butterball and feature a free-range turkey raised on organic feed and Mozart sonatas. Thanksgiving is a symbolic meal, and your typical farm-factory turkey \u2014 loaded with chemicals, hormones and antibiotics \u2014 represents all that is wrong with America\u2019s addiction to fake, tortured food. (None of this need be discussed at table.)\n\nTo express your own commitment to avoid processed foods, serve only real food: fresh veggies, wholesome grains and really good chocolate. But what about everyone\u2019s favorite Pepperidge Farm dressing with pork sausage? Here\u2019s what I know: If you cook with love and choose tasty, fresh ingredients, your family and friends will not be disappointed.\n\nHave a plan. Calm your nerves by getting your Thanksgiving to-do list going now. One by one, day by day, check off what needs to be done. Organizing calms the cluttered mind. Resist martyrdom. If you need help \u2014 with the cooking, the serving or the cleanup \u2014 ask for it. Schedule yourself for at least one non-kitchen activity that makes you feel good \u2014 a run, a yoga class or a call to an old friend you keep meaning to talk to.\n\nCreate a ritual. To shift the mood in the room and bring on the attitude of gratitude, welcome your guests with a clink of the glass. Be bold! Ask them to turn off their cellphones. No peeking, no texting, no distractions. Dim the lights, light a candle and pass it around asking everyone to say who or what they\u2019re grateful for. You may be surprised by how this simple ritual changes the energy and turns a bunch of soloists into a loving choir. Allow your guests to pass without speaking, but keep the candle moving, the spirit rising.\n\nDo something charitable. Make a double-portion of your favorite holiday dish and take it to a homeless shelter, write a check to a favorite nonprofit or extend your hospitality to someone who has nowhere else to go. Generosity, just like maple-glazed Brussels sprouts, is a great thing to pass around.\n\n\u2014Marilynn Preston is a fitness expert, personal trainer and speaker on healthy lifestyle issues.
