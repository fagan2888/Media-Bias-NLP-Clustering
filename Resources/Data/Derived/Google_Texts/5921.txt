The Indio Pow Wow will celebrate Native American heritage at the four-star Fantasy Springs Resort Casino during Thanksgiving weekend.

For 32 years, the Cabazon Band of Mission Indians have kept tradition alive by bringing thousands of tribal and non-tribal people together for a celebration of culture and customs.

The Bird Singers are scheduled to perform during the Grand Entry of the pow wow, according to a news release. The band made an appearance in 2011 at the Gathering of Nations in Albuquerque, New Mexico following their 2009 documentary, Sing Birds: Following the Path of Cahuilla Power.

The pow wow will also feature tribes across the U.S. and Canada who participate in dance and singing competitions.

Most of the events will take place inside the resort’s special events center where there’s enough space to socialize and honor feats of bravery and achievement. Attendees of the Indio Pow Wow will have an opportunity to taste Native American foods such as Indian fry bread and shop for jewelry, weavings and other types of Native American art.

The tribe’s fall gatherings have historically celebrated the successful harvest and brought people together to feast, dance, sing and hold ceremonies. The pow wow is a rich part of the tribe’s history and many come in decorated regalia to show their skill in dance and singing competitions.

All are welcome to attend. Festivities begin on November 29th at 5:00p.m.
