So naturally the Obama administration wants to put an end to them.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services, under a new 500-page rule, sidelines the high-deductible HSA plans in state health insurance exchanges. HSAs allow people in high-deductible plans to put aside money tax-free for their out-of-pocket health care expenses.\n\nOn average, enrollment in HSA plans has climbed 18 percent each year for the past seven years, totaling nearly 20 million people, according to Investor's Business Daily.\n\nEven the mavens of ObamaCare have acknowledged that these consumer-oriented plans have helped contain health care costs. And yet they're penalized: A financial education website survey found that only 19 percent of health plans currently available through the federal ObamaCare marketplace are eligible for HSAs.\n\n\u201cIt is only a matter of time before the HSA-qualified plans completely disappear,\u201d writes Roy J. Ramthun, president of HSA Consulting, for National Review.\n\nContrary to the collective lies of ObamaCare (you can keep your insurance and you'll pay less for health care), HSAs are delivering exactly what they promised and are drawing the public's support. Congress must see to it that they aren't euthanized.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Tribune-Review", "description": "Since 2005 Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) have provided consumers flexibility and some control over their health care dollars.
