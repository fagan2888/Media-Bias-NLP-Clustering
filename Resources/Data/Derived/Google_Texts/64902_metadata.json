The same holds true, when a family\u2019s primary bread winner dies, or a marriage fails.\n\nDuring the last Republican manufactured recession, millions of Americans went from middle class earners who saw their jobs and the economic stability that went with them disappear. Even if one makes all the \u201cright\u201d choices and works hard, expenses can exceed available financial resources.\n\nWhen there is a major loss of income or reduction in income, too often, it means people fall behind in paying their bills and that can have a negative effect on their credit scores.\n\nAs Senator Elizabeth Warren and Rep. Steve Cohen point out in an op-ed for Time, credit reporting companies pushed the narrative that there is a nexus between credit history and a person\u2019s character.\n\nCredit reporting companies that sell Americans\u2019 personal data to potential employers have pushed the narrative that a credit history somehow provides insight into someone\u2019s character. But, as even a representative from the TransUnion credit bureau admitted, they \u201cdon\u2019t have any research to show any statistical correlation between what\u2019s in somebody\u2019s credit report and their job performance.\u201d In fact, research has shown that an individual\u2019s credit has little to no correlation with his or her ability to succeed in the workplace. Credit reports are not a way to screen out bad potential employees; they are just a way to discriminate against people who have fallen on hard times.\u201d Despite facts, pushing this narrative isn\u2019t hard to do when corporate America is already predisposed to believing that financial status and character go hand in hand.\n\nThis belief goes hand in hand with wide support for a reality show star turned Republican Presidential Candidate. While bluster and breaking the \u201crules\u201d of politics play a role, conservatives also believe wealthy people are morally superior to people who are not. Therefore when Donald Trump says he\u2019s rich and therefore the best presidential candidate, people buy it.\n\nAccording to a 2012 survey, by the Society of Human Resources Management, 53% of employers said they don\u2019t do background checks on job candidates, while a whopping 87% said they do check the credit histories of job candidates.\n\nThe survey tells us that the companies that sell credit history information successfully pushed the myth that one\u2019s credit history provides more insight into their character than a background check does.\n\nAs if that wasn\u2019t enough, credit score information can be inaccurate and the companies who create that information then sell it to employers are notoriously slow to correct inaccuracies.\n\nIn 2013, the Federal Trade Commission reported that as many as 1 in 5 consumers identified at least one error in their credit reports.\n\nThe result is discrimination based on a myth and inaccurate information, that effectively shuts people out of the job market. As Senator Warren and Rep. Cohen pointed out in their op-ed, this practice which affects millions of Americans is fundamentally unfair.\n\nFor hardworking people struggling to make ends meet, the only way to get back on their feet is to find a good job and earn a paycheck. But even when they are able to sell their homes\u2014often at a loss\u2014or after they are forced to close their business\u2019 doors or find temporary work, that bad credit history continues to haunt them. And despite the often-desperate effort to find a job, many employers are unfairly shutting the door on applicants with less-than-stellar credit. We should call this what it is: discrimination.\n\nTaken in a broader context, the practice of using credit histories as a factor in hiring further rigs the system against people at the bottom.\n\nIt\u2019s a cruel and vicious cycle that Senator Warren and Rep. Cohen want to stop with a law called the Equal Employment for All Act. Make no mistake, this practice further rigs an already unfair system against hardworking and honest Americans who need a job, more than they need an Ayn Rand-style lecture on the culture of work.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Taken in a broader context, the practice of using credit histories as a factor in hiring further rigs the system against people at the bottom.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Adalia Woodbury", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "Taken in a broader context, the practice of using credit histories as a factor in hiring further rigs the system against people at the bottom.", "title": "Elizabeth Warren Calls For Ending The Use Of Credit Checks To Deny People Jobs", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2015/09/16/elizabeth-warren-calls-credit-checks-shut-people-job-market.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/cohen-warren-credit.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-09-16T13:03:27+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Featured News,U.S. Senate,Democratic Party,Elizabeth Warren,employment,Job Market,Republican-manufactured Recession,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "U.S. Senate", "published_time": "2015-09-16T13:03:23+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-16T13:03:27+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Democratic Party, Elizabeth Warren, employment, Job Market, Republican-manufactured Recession"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2d14\"", "article_summary": "The survey tells us that the companies that sell credit history information successfully pushed the myth that one\u2019s credit history provides more insight into their character than a background check does.\nCredit reporting companies that sell Americans\u2019 personal data to potential employers have pushed the narrative that a credit history somehow provides insight into someone\u2019s character.\nAs Senator Elizabeth Warren and Rep.
