They don\u2019t necessarily have plans for investment, but they do want the freedom to take action or to cooperate with private providers to enhance the economic vitality of their region.\n\nHowever, misguided legislation from a decade ago prohibited cities and counties from spending money on improving broadband service without a public vote. Senate Bill 152 in 2005 was supported by the industry to ensure private Internet providers wouldn\u2019t have to compete with government-funded data networks, according to The Denver Post\u2019s John Aguilar.\n\nIn general, we don\u2019t like the idea of government competing with private businesses that are already serving the market, either. Scarce public resources should be concentrated on programs and services that government really is uniquely qualified to provide.\n\nBut there are communities in Colorado, as critics point out, where customers\u2019 only choices for Internet service are slow and expensive \u2014 if they have any choice at all.\n\nAnd that is particularly true of rural Colorado.\n\nUntil this year, Internet providers poured money into local communities to try to defeat ballot initiatives that allowed local action on broadband. But this time they stood back, maybe realizing that voter approval is much easier to obtain than than was thought when SB 152 passed. Indeed, the referendums have become so automatic that they are clearly a waste of time and money. The legislature should simply lift the requirement.\n\nMost municipalities don\u2019t have the money or systems in place to create their own networks anyway. Most don\u2019t want to replace the private sector but to partner with it, said attorney Ken Fellman.\n\nCitizens should be able to rely on the judgment of their local elected officials to make the call on whether public money should go into broadband services.\n\nTo send a letter to the editor about this article, submit online or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado broadband Internet legislation should be retired", "title": "Colorado broadband Internet legislation should be retired", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/11/06/colorado-broadband-internet-legislation-should-be-retired/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151106__20151109_Z00_OP09E_BROADBANDp1-1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151106__20151109_Z00_OP09E_BROADBANDp1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-06T16:24:30+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-20T09:14:45+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Senate Bill 152 in 2005 was supported by the industry to ensure private Internet providers wouldn\u2019t have to compete with government-funded data networks, according to The Denver Post\u2019s John Aguilar.\nUntil this year, Internet providers poured money into local communities to try to defeat ballot initiatives that allowed local action on broadband.\nHowever, misguided legislation from a decade ago prohibited cities and counties from spending money on improving broadband service without a public vote.\nNearly 40 cities and counties around Colorado voted last Tuesday to reclaim local authority over broadband, which a 2005 law took away absent a public referendum.\nCitizens should be able to rely on the judgment of their local elected officials to make the call on whether public money should go into broadband services."}
