This suggests that the difference in spending is mostly attributable to higher prices of goods and services.\"\n\n\n\nTwelve years later, the evidence of that keeps rolling in. This month\u2019s issue of Health Affairs includes an article on how hospitals hiked the prices charged to private insurance plans for common outpatient procedures far faster than did surgery centers that were independent of hospitals.\n\n\n\nFrom 2007 to 2012, hospital outpatient departments raised prices for colonoscopies 32 percent, the price of cataract surgeries 33 percent and the price of knee arthroscopies 45 percent, according to data analyzed by Kathleen Carey, a Boston University professor of health policy.\n\nMeanwhile, general inflation during those years totaled 13.1 percent, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\n\n\nIndependent surgery centers, by comparison, eked out 5-year price increases of 16 percent for colonoscopies, 1 percent for cataract surgeries and 12 percent for knee arthroscopies.\n\n\n\nCarey\u2019s study used data from Truven Health Analytics, the same source of data that in 2013 showed hospital outpatient prices in Indianapolis were the highest among 13 Midwest metro areas\u2014and 264 percent higher than what the federal Medicare program pays.\n\n\n\nAlso on Thursday, the Workers Compensation Research Institute released its latest data comparing prices among 17 states, including Indiana. And guess what? Prices charged in Indiana were 57 percent higher for physicians and 35 percent higher for hospitals than the median in the study, which included data from 2008 to 2013.\n\n\n\nBut the funny thing is, it\u2019s really only drug prices that are going up right now. Prices for most other health care services are growing at record-low rates. And physician prices have even been moving backward.\n\n\n\nAccording to a report Thursday by the Altarum Institute, health care prices have grown just 1.2 percent over the past year\u2014holding near their lowest rate since data started being kept in 1990.\n\n\n\nHospital prices are up just 1 percent, nursing home prices just 1.6 percent and doctors\u2019 prices actually fell by 1 percent.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s really only prescription drugs that are rising fast\u20144.7 percent in the past year\u2014as drugmakers have rolled out a raft of exorbitantly-priced drugs for hepatitis C and cancer.\n\n\n\nA June survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation find that nearly three-fourths of all Americans think drug prices are unreasonably high.\n\n\n\nEven doctors have started to notice, and are saying no to high-priced \u201cme too\u201d drugs, according to a Thursday report from Reuters. The poster child identified by Reuters was Eli Lilly and Co.\u2019s latest cancer drug Cyramza.\n\n\n\nBut drug spending is one of the smallest pieces of health care costs\u2014less than 10 percent of all health care spending nationally.\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s really changing are health plan deductibles. As I wrote last month, the average size of deductibles on employer-sponsored health insurance grown nearly seven-fold over the past five years.\n\n\n\nAnd nowhere is that more true than in Indiana. In the state\u2019s employer market, 89 percent of participants now have deductibles of at least $1,500, according to a survey by United Benefit Advisors.\n\n\n\nThat trend is very likely playing a big role in holding down health care prices.\n\n\n\nAnd it\u2019s not likely to end, unless Republicans in Congress\u2014or a President Hillary Clinton\u2014repeals the Obamacare Cadillac tax (as both have vowed to do).\n\n\n\nSince President Obama won\u2019t go for that, expect the paradox of tepid price growth and boiling patient anger to continue until at least 2017.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Try out this paradox: &nbsp; Health care providers are holding down their prices better than at any time in the past 25 years. &nbsp; But patients are madder than ever about the high cost of health care.
