New York Times columnist and Nobel Prize winner Paul Krugman argued “there is a level of openness” to alternative points of view among liberals that is not shared by conservatives on Monday’s broadcast of MSNBC’s “All In with Chris Hayes.”

Krugman said, “There’s this hermetic universe of — where you only watch Fox News and you only listen to people, and if you — some information that doesn’t suit your world view comes along it’s because of the liberal bias of the media.”

After host Chris Hayes said that some people might accuse liberals of being “contained in their own liberal bubble too.” Krugman stated, “Yeah, but, I mean — certainly, people like people who are like you. You like people who share your opinions. But it’s just not — you know, people like me are aware of what’s on Fox News. I have a suspicion that the people on — who are Fox News watchers have no idea what’s on MSNBC, and we see that in lots of things. I mean, one of the kind of things we do in my professional circuits is we say that a liberal economist can imitate a conservative economist, can pretend, can, you know, what will one of those guys say? The reverse is not true. So, there is a level of openness to at least acknowledging that there are other viewpoints, not agreeing with them, but understanding them that is not symmetric.”

Krugman further pointed to conservatives who alleged that unemployment and Obamacare enrollment numbers were inaccurate.
