The FAA has shut down drone operations in the meantime by groups as varied as an Internet beer company and the Washington Nationals baseball team in recent months.\n\nThe technology originally was sought by police and other law enforcement groups. It has drawn criticism from privacy advocates like Markey who have raised concerns about increased surveillance, however.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The FAA is under pressure to approve the use of commercial drones quickly.", "description": "The FAA is under pressure to approve the use of commercial drones quickly.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Keith Laing", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The FAA is under pressure to approve the use of commercial drones quickly.", "title": "Move would ground domestic drones over privacy concerns", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/209962-markey-amendment-grounds-drones-until-privacy-is-addressed", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/amazondrone_120213amazon.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-06-19T15:23:03-04:00", "type": "article"}, "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2014-06-19T15:23-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/209962-markey-amendment-grounds-drones-until-privacy-is-addressed", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2014-06-19T14:24-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Keith Laing", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-19T14:24:51-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-19T15:23:03-04:00"}, "keywords": "Drone, Unmanned aerial vehicle, Privacy, Federal Aviation Administration,Ed Markey,", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/209962-markey-amendment-grounds-drones-until-privacy-is-addressed", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The FAA is under pressure to approve the use of commercial drones quickly.", "card": "summary", "title": "Move would ground domestic drones over privacy concerns"}, "dcterms.title": "Move would ground domestic drones over privacy concerns"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2c02\"", "article_summary": "Markey said that it was important to place a privacy check on commercial drones before their use becomes more widespread.\nIt has drawn criticism from privacy advocates like Markey who have raised concerns about increased surveillance, however.\nThe FAA is under pressure to approve the use of commercial drones quickly.\nmoved Thursday to prohibit the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) from approving the use of non-military drones unless the agency takes steps to protect U.S. residents' privacy.\nADVERTISEMENT\"We need to build in strong personal privacy protections and public transparency measures before commercial drones take off, which is exactly what my amendment will do,\" Markey said in a statement."}
