Downing, heavyweight Harris, lead Eagles to third-place finish at prestigious tourney

LAFAYETTE — Phil Downing has a flair for the dramatic.

With less than a month until he becomes the center of attention for the state of Colorado in his quest to become a four-time state champion, the Broomfield senior knows there is still plenty of work to be done.

Downing rallied from a 4-3 deficit in the final 10 seconds against Rio Rancho's Miguel Barreras to score a 6-4 victory and his second Top of the Rockies title at Centaurus High School.

"I knew it was going to be a dog fight the whole match," said Downing, who improved to 29-3 this season, "and those final 30 seconds, I knew that even if I didn't have it in me, I had to dig deep. I did not want to lose at all."

Barreras scored a takedown with 45 seconds remaining, much to the glee of the pro-underdog crowd rooting against Downing, to go up 4-3. The crowd was further worked into a fury when Barreras was called for penalty that ultimately was waved off.

"That just drives me more and makes me more pissed. It makes me want to win that much more and prove them wrong," said Downing of the crowd.

With 10 seconds to go and on the edge of the mat, Downing scored the much needed takedown and was awarded a penalty point for the eventual 6-4 win.

Broomfield, which finished third in the team race behind Arvada West (200) and Thomspon Valley (155.5) with 144 points, had one other champion on Saturday night. Heavyweight Austyn Harris beat Cheyenne East's Brett Schaeffer 3-1 in overtime.

"The match is never over until it's over," said Harris, who scored a huge 4-3 quarterfinal win of 5A No. 1 Jorge Rodriguez of Mountain Range in the quarterfinals. "It means a lot, but I still have to perform at state, because I'm not going to see any of these guys down there."

Zach Stodden drew three-time Nebraska state champion JaVaughn Perkins in the 182-pound final and didn't have his best day. Perkins was up 6-0 before eventually pinning the Eagles senior at 2:58.

"I wrestled hard in the semis and just didn't bring it to the finals," said Stodden, who beat defending 5A champion Dylan Gabel of Ponderosa to get to the title match.

Legacy's Ryan Deakin made a statement in the 113-pound final. The unbeaten Lightning senior, currently ranked No. 1 by On the Mat, methodically took out Cherry Creek's Matt Finesilver 7-0.

"That felt pretty good, but I've still got a bunch of stuff to work on," said Deakin, who ran his record to 32-0 after the win. "You're never satisfied. You just keep wrestling and keep improving."

Holy Family's Joseph Prieto won his third-place match against Rocky Mountain's top-seeded Danny Murphy 8-3.

"He had beaten my brother (Julian) earlier and I knew who he was, but I tried not to look at the bracket," said Prieto, who watch his brother match lose a match earlier in his third-place bout at 132 pounds.
