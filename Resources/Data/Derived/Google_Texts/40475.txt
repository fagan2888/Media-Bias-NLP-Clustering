One man is facing charges after a hit and run accident that shut down Powers Blvd. in Colorado Springs Sunday morning.

Police say the suspect, Dwayne Lujan, rear-ended another car while driving south on Powers Blvd. just north of Galley Rd. The second vehicle then hit a guardrail and the center median.

Police say Lujan and several passengers fled the scene in another vehicle. They were later located.

Lujan was arrested. Some of his passengers were taken to the hospital to be treated for minor injuries, according to police.

Lujan will face DUI and hit and run charges.

The driver in the other car was not hurt, according to police.

The crash happened just before 3 a.m. Sunday.

All lanes of Powers were closed while crews responded to the scene. Southbound Powers was later opened, followed by the northbound lanes.
