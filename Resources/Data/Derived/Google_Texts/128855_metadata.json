There's no such provision, however, preventing insurance companies from charging higher premiums to the 19 percent of Americans who smoke.\n\nSome states - including California, New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts - prohibit charging smokers higher premiums. The surcharge isn't banned in Alabama, however, and will vary state-to-state. The average surcharge, according to Businessweek, is 20 percent.\n\nAt its highest, the penalty fora 55-year-old smoker could reach nearly $4,250 a year. A 60-year-old could wind up paying nearly $5,100 on top of premiums, Fox Business reports.\n\nThe ACA also prohibits people from using government healthcare subsidies to pay for the additional costs related to tobacco usage.\n\nThe American Lung Association and American Cancer Society have both spoken out against the surcharge, saying the benefits from encouraging people to kick the habit will be outweighed if they opt not to seek healthcare due to the higher costs.\n\nSmoking claims about 443,000 Americans each year and costs the nation more than $193 billion in medical care and lost productivity, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "news", "title": "Obamacare's smoking surcharge could be as high as 50 percent: Reports", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Obamacare\\u0027s smoking surcharge could be as high as 50 percent: Reports\", \"link\": \"http://blog.al.com/breaking/2013/12/obamacares_smoking_surcharge_c.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://image.al.com/home/bama-media/width620/img/live/photo/13848923-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"11788322\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-12-08T16:52:46Z\", \"author\": \"Leada Gore | lgore@al.com\", \"tags\": [\"@river-all\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://image.al.com/home/bama-media/width620/img/live/photo/13848923-standard.jpg", "creator": "@LeadaGore", "site": "@aldotcom", "card": "summary", "description": "Smokers may find themselves paying as much as 50 percent higher than non-smokers under the Affordable Care Act, according to a Bloomberg/Businessweek report."}, "article_date_updated": "Sunday, December 08, 2013, 10:52 AM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"short_title\": \"\", \"image_url\": \"http://media.al.com/live/photo/smokingjpg-406bd42516886148.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"LeadaGore\", \"author_nickname\": \"Leada Gore | lgore@al.com\", \"author_id\": \"10449117\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Retired: Real-Time News from Huntsville\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://blog.al.com/breaking/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "AL.com", "description": "Smokers may find themselves paying as much as 50 percent higher than non-smokers under the Affordable Care Act, according to a Bloomberg/Businessweek report.", "title": "Obamacare's smoking surcharge could be as high as 50 percent: Reports", "url": "http://blog.al.com/breaking/2013/12/obamacares_smoking_surcharge_c.html", "image": "http://image.al.com/home/bama-media/width620/img/live/photo/13848923-standard.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "AL.com", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/leada.gore"}, "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Sunday, December 08, 2013, 10:52 AM", "article_author": "Leada Gore | lgore@al.com", "Description": "Smokers may find themselves paying as much as 50 percent higher than non-smokers under the Affordable Care Act, according to a Bloomberg/Businessweek report."}, "article_summary": "There's no such provision, however, preventing insurance companies from charging higher premiums to the 19 percent of Americans who smoke.\nSome states - including California, New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts - prohibit charging smokers higher premiums.\nThe ACA, commonly known as Obamacare, prohibits insurers from charging people higher premiums for preexisting conditions such as diabetes or cancer.\nThe average surcharge, according to Businessweek, is 20 percent.\nA 60-year-old could wind up paying nearly $5,100 on top of premiums, Fox Business reports."}
