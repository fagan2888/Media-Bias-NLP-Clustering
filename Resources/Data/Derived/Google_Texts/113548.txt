Linda Rolain passed away at her Las Vegas home on Monday after the Nevada resident but the Obamacare enrolleee died needlessly. Rolain’s family had joined two lawsuits against the State of Nevada and the company that set up its troubled online software, Xerox.

The Nevada resident tried to enroll in the state’s health exchange in November and after numerous issues, finally paid in January for coverage to start in March. But when she went to get treatment, there was no record of her name and she finally received an insurance card in May.

She underwent surgery in mid-May but struggled to recover.

When Congress approved and President Barack Obama signed Obamacare into law, pro-life advocates warned about rationing. This is one of the forms rationing takes — when government bureacracy fails to get it right and provide the lifesaving medical care and treatment patients need.
