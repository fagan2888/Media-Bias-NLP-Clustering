It is 25 miles or so from the nearest town that, with 609 residents, counts as the most populous in the county.\n\nThis remote section of Colorado ranch country and its dry creek reflect the stark beauty of such open places, but the blood spilled and dried on this ground 151 years ago bestowed a dark significance that echoes today.\n\nOn November 29, 1864, about 675 volunteer soldiers under Col. John Chivington descended here on the peaceful settlements of Cheyenne and Arapaho peoples, killing 160 to 200 mostly women, children and elderly men and later committing atrocities against even the lifeless bodies.\n\nThe land seems pastoral today, but the history it bears has weighed for eight years on a group of National Park Service personal, representatives of the Cheyenne and Arapaho peoples, and officials of the state of Colorado and Kiowa County as they considered the wisest management of the site commemorating the Sand Creek Massacre.\n\nThe public comment period on general management options and environmental assessment closed at the end of July, and the NPS likely will announce the adopted plan later this year.\n\n\u201cEvery process at Sand Creek is a very deliberate process,\u201d said site Superintendent Alexa Roberts, explaining that the site\u2019s mandate requires the maximum input by the tribes.\n\nAlthough the NPS and other planning partners preferred one alternative, the legal mandate for the NPS requires multiple options, said Tom Thomas, project manager in the NPS\u2019s Denver Service Center. Five alternatives were presented, from no change to extensive expansion of public access.\n\nCurrently the site has little development beyond a ranch road, a small parking area near a maintenance shed and temporary visitor contact station-office trailer, picnic tables and vault toilets. The on-site station allows little more than contact with a park ranger and pick up of brochures.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t have exhibits and that sort of thing,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a full visitor center where they can get orientation with exhibits\u2026 Under the (preferred) plan, we would move the visitor contact out of that little building\u2026 and make it a separate very small place where it would still contain the book sales, restrooms, interpretive plaza.\u201d\n\nThe mostly likely alternative, the plan preferred by the Park Service, tribal representatives and state and county officials, would expand on-site facilities with administrative and maintenance space, additional restrooms, a road and parking.\n\nIt would add a visitor orientation and research center, potentially in a historic main-street building in nearby Eads. \u201cThe intention is to gather Sand Creek materials from wherever they might be across the country,\u201d Roberts said.\n\nThe plan would also expand to 1.5 miles a trail that follows the ridgeline and would allow visitors to view from the ridgeline the killing field and former village sites. It would not allow direct access to that area.\n\n\u201cThe tribes by consensus liked it best,\u201d Thomas said, and state and county representatives also agreed to support that alternative.\n\n\u201cIt provides the perfect balance,\u201d Roberts said of that alternative. \u201cThe really successful thing about this trail and the interpretation is that it starts before the visitor even enters the park, it starts as the visitor approaches in the entrance.\u201d\n\nThe chosen general management plan will direct the physical site for the next 15 to 20 years, but it does not provide designated funding to accomplish the goals. It also does not determine the site\u2019s interpretive direction.\n\nInterpretive themes will be explored at a workshop in October with representatives of the NPS and the Northern Cheyenne Tribe, Northern Arapaho Tribe at Wind River, and the Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes based in Oklahoma.\n\nThe legislative mandate for the Sand Creek Massacre Historic Site, Roberts said, \u201cis to provide the public with an understanding of the massacre and its impact\u201d and thereby help \u201cto prevent such atrocities from ever occurring again.\u201d\n\nBut the NPS also is charged with preserving the site and maintaining it as a memorial, and since the historic site opened, there have been several ceremonies during which human remains\u2014often removed as \u201ctrophies\u201d by the soldiers that ended up in private and public collections\u2014have been buried at the site.\n\n\u201cThe landscape is defined,\u201d Roberts said, \u201cby the cultural value that the Cheyenne and Arapaho people place on it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Five alternatives were presented for changes to the Sand Creek Massacre Site\u2014no change to extensive expansion of public access\u2014what will happen?", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "leeanne", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/08/11/how-best-use-sand-creek-massacre-site-161296", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/default/files/uploads/sand-creek-massacre-plaque.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "How Best to Use the Sand Creek Massacre Site?"}, "abstract": "Five alternatives were presented for changes to the Sand Creek Massacre Site\u2014no change to extensive expansion of public access\u2014what will happen?", "keywords": "Konnie LeMay, National Parks Service, Sand Creek Massacre, Sand Creek Massacre National Historic Site, Native American History", "dc": {"title": "How Best to Use the Sand Creek Massacre Site?"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/08/11/how-best-use-sand-creek-massacre-site-161296", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "robots": "follow, index", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.date": "2015-08-11T10:00-04:00", "dcterms.title": "How Best to Use the Sand Creek Massacre Site?"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd747\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe intention is to gather Sand Creek materials from wherever they might be across the country,\u201d Roberts said.\n\u201cEvery process at Sand Creek is a very deliberate process,\u201d said site Superintendent Alexa Roberts, explaining that the site\u2019s mandate requires the maximum input by the tribes.\n\u201cThe landscape is defined,\u201d Roberts said, \u201cby the cultural value that the Cheyenne and Arapaho people place on it.\u201d\n\u201cThe tribes by consensus liked it best,\u201d Thomas said, and state and county representatives also agreed to support that alternative.\nThe nearly 2,400-acre stretch of grasslands is split by a waterless creek bed."}
