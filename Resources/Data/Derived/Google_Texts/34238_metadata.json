She easily brings smiles to the people around her.\n\nOn bad days, the 11-year-old wakes up in bloody sheets or lies down on the school floor and says nothing all day. When her seizures become particularly intense, she is rushed to the hospital.\n\nThe images of those extremes collected in a collage helped persuade Florida lawmakers to support a bill that will soon allow parents to treat their epileptic children with marijuana that has a low amount of THC, the chemical that causes intoxication. What seemed improbable a few months ago is now about to become a law with the help of a severely epileptic girl whose story melted hearts.\n\n\u201cWhen we first started this, people were like, \u2018Are you crazy? It\u2019s never going to pass,\u201d\u2019 said RayAnn\u2019s father, Peyton Moseley, who along with his wife, Holley, met with dozens of lawmakers showing them the photos of RayAnn. \u201cThey could see the difference when she\u2019s having good days as opposed to when she\u2019s having bad days. It helped to really put a face on it.\u201d\n\nEven Gov. Rick Scott, who has firmly opposed medical marijuana, welcomed RayAnn into his office, hugged her and assured her parents he would sign the bill.\n\nOnce Scott signs the bill, which passed the Legislature overwhelmingly on the last day of this year\u2019s legislative session, strains of marijuana with low amounts of THC and high amounts of cannabidiol, or CBD, which is used to treat seizures, will be legal in Florida for certain medical conditions.\n\nStill, a handful of House members raised concerns, including a lack of U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval for the drug\u2019s use and the possibility that the bill will open the door for wider spread use of marijuana.\n\n\u201cThis could be the rifle shot that starts a massive avalanche,\u201d Rep. Dennis Baxley, R-Ocala, said after the vote. \u201cWhen I look at that I simply can\u2019t pull the trigger.\u201d\n\nThe journey to passage began late last year when the Moseleys traveled from the Pensacola area to Colorado and talked to parents of epileptic children whose seizures have been reduced or eliminated after treating them with oil from a marijuana strain known as \u201cCharlotte\u2019s Web,\u201d named for the epileptic girl it originally helped in 2012. They also talked to the Stanley brothers, marijuana growers who developed the strain, which is legal in Colorado.\n\nThat\u2019s when they decided to seek the treatment\u2019s legalization in Florida, teaming up with two lobbyists and a publicist who donated their time. Simultaneously, conservative Panhandle Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz was being pressured by a Democratic colleague to support the idea of legalizing Charlotte\u2019s Web. He was skeptical, but willing to listen. He set up a phone call with the Stanley brothers, who told him about the Moseleys.\n\n\u201cI was not on fire for the issue until I got to meet the Moseleys,\u201d Gaetz said. \u201cSharing the Moseleys\u2019 story lit a fire in me that I couldn\u2019t find a way to put out until passing this bill.\u201d\n\nPart of that story is how RayAnn came into the Moseleys\u2019 lives. RayAnn\u2019s birth mother was a prostitute and drug user. She often didn\u2019t get the medication doctors prescribed to treat the seizures that have tormented her since birth. The state took custody of RayAnn when she was 2, but it\u2019s not easy finding foster parents for a child with cerebral palsy and intractable epilepsy. They placed her at a hospital where Holly Moseley, a pediatric nurse, saw her in a crib covered with netting.\n\n\u201cWe just connected. You just can\u2019t help but fall in love with those blue eyes,\u201d Moseley said. \u201cYou could just see inside of her that need for love.\u201d\n\nThree days later, Moseley was off but couldn\u2019t help thinking about RayAnn stuck in a crib that looked like a cage. Christmas was approaching and she got permission to have RayAnn join her family for the holidays.\n\n\u201cShe laughed the whole night - there was just a big smile on her face,\u201d Moseley said. Right after Christmas, the Moseleys hired a lawyer and started a three-year fight to adopt RayAnn, whose birth mother resisted giving her up. The same month Moseley gave birth to her first of two biological children, RayAnn became the couple\u2019s adoptive daughter.\n\n\u201cOn the good days, it\u2019s fabulous,\u201d said her teacher, Angela Pettus. \u201cShe is just so much fun, she is such a joy. She keeps us laughing, she keeps us entertained.\u201d\n\nBut on the bad days she can be angry and frustrated either by the side effects of her medications or when her seizures increase in intensity.\n\n\u201cShe will go through spurts of extreme growth where she\u2019s getting things, things are starting to click. She\u2019s doing great, she\u2019s reading, she\u2019s comprehending, she\u2019s doing math,\u201d Pettus said. \u201cThen she\u2019ll go through a period of seizures and she\u2019ll lose a lot of it and we\u2019re back to square one again. It\u2019s hard to watch that in a child.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s just a lot of intelligence in there, that if they could get her seizures under control and they could get her leveled out, her doors could be wide open,\u201d Pettus said.\n\nRayAnn\u2019s cerebral palsy affects her ability to speak and, while her parents understand her, most people have a difficult time communicating with her. The Moseleys hope that could change with help from Charlotte\u2019s Web.\n\n\u201cIn the state of Colorado we do know that 85 percent of children who are using non-euphoric marijuana to control seizures and spasms have seen a 50 to 100 percent reduction in those seizures,\u201d Gaetz said.\n\n\u201cI imagine that there\u2019s this whole other inner being in RayAnn that hasn\u2019t come out yet that wants to come out, that just hasn\u2019t physically been able to come out. I just look really look forward to meeting her for the first time pharmaceutical free,\u201d Peyton Moseley said. \u201cI don\u2019t think God has brought us this far for it not to work.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sun, 08 Jun 2014 15:08:55 -0400", "Description": "GULF BREEZE \u2013 On good days when her epileptic seizures aren\u2019t severe, RayAnn Moseley laughs, sings, dances, swims and practices with the children\u2019s choir at her church.
