The Broncos on Sunday night officially opened as 27.5 point favorites over Jacksonville next week. And it is now the highest point spread in NFL history.

The line — the Glantz-Culver line set by Keith Glantz and Russell Culver and syndicated to The Associated Press — is set every Sunday by halftime of the night game for the games the next week.

The full odds from multiple services for next week can be found here later Monday night.

The Broncos (5-0) are averaging 46.0 points this season and allowing 34.2.

The Jaguars (0-5) are scoring just 10.2 points per game allowing 32.6.

The previous record-high point spread in an NFL game came in 1976, when Pittsburgh was a 24-point favorite over expansion Tampa Bay on Dec. 5. Pittsburgh won that game 42-0.

The previous biggest line not involving an expansion team came in 2007, when New England was favored by 23.5 points over Philadelphia. But the Patriots squeaked that one out, winning just 31-28.
