It was part of Sonora Regional Medical Center\u2019s outreach program called Oak Plus.\n\nAmbulances in Tuolumne County responded to more than 8,000 calls in 2015, the highest number in the county\u2019s ambulance history, Caldera said.\n\nThis month, the ambulance calls are up 119 over last April, Caldera said.\n\nMuch of that can be attributed to increased insurance coverage of local residents through the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe number of people enrolled in Medi-Cal doubled from the rollout of the ACA in 2014 to the end of 2015 in Tuolumne County, according to the Tuolumne County Department of Social Services. About 23 percent of the county was enrolled in Medi-Cal at the end of 2015.\n\nThat is good news for the people getting medical coverage, but it means low reimbursement rates for service providers.\n\nAn ambulance ride typically gets covered by Medicare at 80 percent, Caldera said. People with supplemental insurance usually don\u2019t have to pay a balance, he said.\n\nFor a $3,000 ambulance ride, Medi-Cal will pay about $142. It\u2019s illegal to bill Medi-Cal recipients for the balance, so the rest has to be written off, Caldera said.\n\nAbout 20 percent of calls the ambulances in Tuolumne County respond to are \u201cdry runs,\u201d where the patient either doesn\u2019t need to go to the hospital, doesn\u2019t want to go to the hospital or is past the point of going.\n\nPeople aren\u2019t charged for \u201cdry runs,\u201d Caldera said.\n\nThis summer, the ambulance service will get another half-time ambulance. There are 11 ambulances in the fleet, and four of those are new Mercedes Benz ambulances under warranty. They arrived in 2015. The Mercedes ambulances were $2,000 cheaper than the Chevy one\u2019s, and the maintenance costs are 40 percent less, Caldera said.\n\nA new ambulance is $125,000; a gurney is $15,000; a heart machine is $36,000; and a medical bag with supplies is about $8,000.\n\nThe fleet drives an average of 259,000 miles a year.\n\nEMTs start out making $11 per hour and work their way up in salary. Paramedics make $20 an hour and can make more than $72,000 a year plus benefits and retirement, Caldera said.\n\nWhen Caldera started out as a paramedic in the late 1970s, he made $3.27 an hour.\n\nParamedics work 24-hour shifts.\n\nThere are five ambulances in service at any given time in Tuolumne County and, come July, there will be one more operating halftime. The ambulances serve a 2,200-mile area from the top of Sonora Pass to Knights Ferry, and from the Calaveras County line to Groveland.\n\nIn the 1970s, when formal ambulance services started, there was no state licensing, and paramedics in Tuolumne County were Search and Rescue members trained by a doctor.\n\nCaldera worked at the lumber mill before going to paramedic school in Modesto. Before private organizations took over ambulance services, the ambulances in Tuolumne County were driven by funeral home employees.\n\nThe funeral directors had first-aid training, and the hearses had a double-sided sign with one side that said \u201cAmbulance\u201d and the other side said \u201cFuneral home.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey never had a dry run. Everybody went somewhere,\u201d Caldera said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ambulance rides in Tuolumne County are expected to increase 18 percent this year.
