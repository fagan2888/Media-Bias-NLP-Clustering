Incumbent Senator Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and Democratic Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes are the two major party candidates currently on the ballot.\n\nPatterson\u2019s candidacy is a wild card in Minority Leader McConnell\u2019s effort to take over the reins as Majority Leader of the Senate in January 2015, should Republicans regain the majority there.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nA recent Bluegrass Poll of the Kentucky U.S. Senate race found McConnell ahead of Democrat Grimes in a two-way race with a 47%-to-45% lead, albeit within the poll\u2019s margin of error, making them statistically tied.\n\nThe same poll shows McConnell maintains a two-point margin (41% to 39%) over Grimes in a three-way race, with Patterson receiving the support of 7% of the voters. Patterson\u2019s entry increases the number of undecideds from 8% to 13%, adding uncertainty into the race for McConnell.\n\nThe Bluegrass Poll of 604 likely voters was conducted between July 18 and July 23.\n\nIn a tight general election where the margin of victory is expected to be less than 5% \u2013 or 75,000 votes out of an anticipated 1.5 million votes to be cast \u2013 embittered supporters of Matt Bevin, the Tea Party-endorsed challenger who was \u201ccrushed\u201d in the May 2014 Republican primary by McConnell 60% to 36%, could determine the outcome. It\u2019s conceivable that Grimes could ride pro-Bevin defectors to Patterson to victory.\n\nThe likelihood of such a dramatic switch by Republican primary voters, however, is uncertain.\n\nA week ago, before the Libertarian Patterson qualified for the ballot, United Kentucky Tea Party [UKTP] spokesperson Scott Hofstra told the Daily Beast the Mississippi GOP Senate primary, where incumbent Sen. Thad Cochran narrowly won by actively targeting Democratic voters, was a turning point for the group.\n\n\u201cIf there were some people [in the Tea Party] on the fence [about McConnell] after what happened in Kentucky, the Mississippi incident really put them over the edge.\u201d The UKTP is an informal coalition of more than a dozen of the largest local Tea Party groups in Kentucky. The group supported Bevin in his primary challenge of McConnell.\n\nBut for the Libertarian candidate to receive 75,000 to 125,000 votes from Tea Party supporters will require more than a mere endorsement from the UKTP. Such a result will require a boots-on-the-ground door-knocking effort, and despite the lingering hostility among Kentucky Tea Party members towards McConnell, that level of organization has not yet been reached.\n\nJohn Kemper, a leader in the UKTP who also worked on the Bevin campaign, told Breitbart News on Monday that the UKTP \u201chas not taken an official position on the US Senate race in Kentucky.\u201d Kemper added that \u201cDavid Patterson has the required 5,000 signatures to appear on the ballot in November,\u201d but how many Tea Party votes his candidacy will attract is uncertain.\n\n\u201cMy friends in the Libertarian party, including the state party chair, are urging David to reach out [to Tea Party members in Kentucky],\u201d Kemper said. \u201cUKTP members have varying positions in this race. I believe it would be difficult to arrive at an official position other than they really do not want McConnell. That feeling is growing stronger after Mississippi and other tactics used by the establishment.\u201d\n\nAs for Bevin, who was highly critical of McConnell\u2019s attacks on him in the immediate aftermath of his primary loss, his interest in a potential 2015 run for Governor on the Republican ticket suggests that he is at present unlikely to endorse McConnell\u2019s Libertarian challenger.\n\nAccording to Louisville public radio station WFPL, \u201cPatterson filed over 9,100 raw signatures with the Kentucky secretary of state\u2019s office Monday in his bid to make the ballot for the U.S. Senate election\u2026 Independent and third party candidates must collect a minimum of 5,000 signatures before the Aug. 12 deadline. Libertarian Party Chair Ken Moellman said they have verified approximately 5,700 signatures using a voter registration database.\u201d\n\nWFPL also reported, \u201cThe secretary of state\u2019s office will review Patterson\u2019s signatures and will announce if he met the criteria [to be placed on the ballot] within 24 hours.\u201d\n\nThis sets up an interesting scenario.\n\nThe Secretary of State \u2013 McConnell\u2019s Democratic opponent Grimes \u2013 stands to benefit politically if her subordinates verify Patterson\u2019s signatures and place his name on the ballot. While no one has yet suggested that this potential conflict of interest may influence the integrity of the signature verification process, it is likely that Senator McConnell\u2019s political team and attorneys are watching this process very closely.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Libertarian on Kentucky Senate Ballot Could Hurt Mitch McConnell", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Libertarian on Kentucky Senate Ballot Could Hurt Mitch McConnell", "title": "Libertarian on Kentucky Senate Ballot Could Hurt Mitch McConnell - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2013/Congress/Senate%20Republicans/mcconnell-standing-ap-640x480.jpg", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2014/08/11/libertarian-on-kentucky-senate-ballot-could-hurt-mcconnell/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Libertarian on Kentucky Senate Ballot Could Hurt Mitch McConnell", "title": "Libertarian on Kentucky Senate Ballot Could Hurt Mitch McConnell - Breitbart", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2013/Congress/Senate%20Republicans/mcconnell-standing-ap-640x480.jpg", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Mitch McConnell, Senate, Thad Cochran,Big Government,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "Thad Cochran", "published_time": "2014-08-11T19:41:18-07:00", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7e15\"", "article_summary": "\u201cMy friends in the Libertarian party, including the state party chair, are urging David to reach out [to Tea Party members in Kentucky],\u201d Kemper said.\nSuch a result will require a boots-on-the-ground door-knocking effort, and despite the lingering hostility among Kentucky Tea Party members towards McConnell, that level of organization has not yet been reached.\nIncumbent Senator Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and Democratic Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes are the two major party candidates currently on the ballot.\nBut for the Libertarian candidate to receive 75,000 to 125,000 votes from Tea Party supporters will require more than a mere endorsement from the UKTP.\nPatterson\u2019s entry increases the number of undecideds from 8% to 13%, adding uncertainty into the race for McConnell."}
