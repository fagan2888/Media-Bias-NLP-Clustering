He said Americans and their president could not be more thankful.\n\n\u201cBecause of the extraordinary service of the men and women in the American armed forces, Afghanistan has a chance to rebuild its own country,\u201d Obama said to applause from Marines and their families. \u201cWe are safer. It\u2019s not going to be a source of terrorist attacks again.\u201d\n\nThirteen years and $1 trillion later, the U.S. is preparing to pull the vast majority of its combat troops out of Afghanistan by year\u2019s end, as the U.S. and its partners seek to turn the page on a bloody chapter that started the day that al-Qaida militants struck American soil on Sept. 11, 2011. From a peak 140,000 troops in 2010, the U.S. and NATO plan to leave just 13,500 behind for training and battlefield support.\n\nAlthough there are reasons for cautious optimism, including a new Afghan president whose seriousness of effort has inspired U.S. confidence, the broader picture still looks glim.\n\nThe U.S. is shifting to a supporting role after the bloodiest year in Afghanistan since the 2001 U.S.-led invasion. Civilian casualties this year are on track to hit 10,000, and some 5,000 Afghan forces were also killed in 2014, a figure that has escalated as the country took on a greater role in its own security. Insurgents have seized territory across the country, raising fears that Islamic militants will successfully exploit the security vacuum formed as the U.S. pulls out.\n\nRoughly 2,200 U.S. troops were killed in Afghanistan over the last 13 years in a war that cost the U.S. $1 trillion, plus another $100 billion for reconstruction. A celebratory cheer of \u201chooah\u201d rang out from the hundreds of troops here when Obama affirmed that the combat mission was finally ending.\n\n\u201cWe still have some very difficult missions around the world - including in Iraq,\u201d Obama said. But, he added, \u201cthe world is better, it\u2019s safer, it\u2019s more peaceful, it\u2019s more prosperous and our homeland protected because of you.\u201d\n\nOn the U.S. mainland and across the globe, other prominent leaders were fanning out, echoing the president\u2019s message with their own Christmas visits and phone calls to American troops.\n\nVice President Joe Biden and his wife, Jill, visited Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, to spend time with wounded troops and their families and express gratitude for their service. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel called military members on deployment, the Pentagon said, including those in Afghanistan and others assigned to U.S. Central Command, which is running the U.S. mission to fight the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria.\n\nSen. John McCain, R-Ariz., was spending Christmas in Kabul, Afghanistan, where the former Navy pilot met Thursday with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and his chief executive officer, Abdullah Abdullah. A chief critic of Obama\u2019s foreign policy, McCain is set to lead the Senate Armed Services Committee next year.\n\nObama\u2019s visit to the Marine Corps base - where troops and their families had just finished a Christmas dinner of turkey, lobster and candied yams - came midway through his annual family vacation in Hawaii, where the president was spending the holiday unwinding from a turbulent year in Washington.\n\nAfter waking up their rented vacation home in Kailua, Obama, his wife and two daughters opened presents and sang carols before pulling up midday in their motorcade to Bellows Air Force Station, a waterfront post with picturesque views of Hawaii\u2019s lush green mountains. With a calm breeze rolling in over the ocean, the Obamas spent roughly two hours with friends on the beach looking out at the piercing aquamarine waters of the Pacific Ocean.\n\n___\n\nReach Josh Lederman on Twitter at http://twitter.com/joshledermanAP", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Barack Obama marked the end of more than a decade of combat in Afghanistan by paying tribute to America's military, telling troops on Christmas Day that their sacrifices have allowed for a more peaceful, prosperous world to emerge out of the ashes of 9/11.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "President Barack Obama marked the end of more than a decade of combat in Afghanistan by paying tribute to America\u2019s military, telling troops on Christmas Day that their sacrifices have allowed for a more peaceful, prosperous world to emerge out of the ashes of 9/11.", "title": "On Christmas, Obama marks end of Afghan combat", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/dec/25/obamas-christmas-in-hawaii-carols-calls-to-us-troo/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/25/5a750778926c4632690f6a7067003a73.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/25/5a750778926c4632690f6a7067003a73.jpg", "description": "President Barack Obama marked the end of more than a decade of combat in Afghanistan by paying tribute to America's military, telling troops on Christmas Day that their sacrifices have allowed for a m", "card": "summary", "title": "On Christmas, Obama marks end of Afghan combat"}, "Author": "JOSH LEDERMAN", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWe still have some very difficult missions around the world - including in Iraq,\u201d Obama said.\nA celebratory cheer of \u201chooah\u201d rang out from the hundreds of troops here when Obama affirmed that the combat mission was finally ending.\n\u201cBecause of the extraordinary service of the men and women in the American armed forces, Afghanistan has a chance to rebuild its own country,\u201d Obama said to applause from Marines and their families.\nSen.
