Blame the media? Check. Call for a cut on government spending? Check. Praise Reagan? Check.\n\nThe process has become so rote, you might as well automate the whole thing. Which is what we did.\n\nWe made a group of bots that attempt to simulate a fresh, never-seen-before debate transcript, generated from the debates that have already occurred.\n\nEach of the 11 bots is based on one of the main Republican contenders, with an extra bot that combines the moderators from CNN, Fox News, and CNBC. The bots mix and match together all the words and phrases candidates have said in previous debates, in attempts to form a complete sentence.\n\nWith the bots programmed, we launched our own debate. Here is the moderator\u2019s auto-generated introduction, as well as an opening statement from each of the candidates:\n\nMODERATOR: To viewers who are just joining us, welcome to the first debate night of the road. Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush.\n\nBUSH: We\u2019re going to show up?\n\nMODERATOR: Doctor Ben Carson.\n\nCARSON: I didn\u2019t say that I sound logical also.\n\nMODERATOR: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie.\n\nCHRISTIE: I don\u2019t have a better life.\n\nMODERATOR: Texas Senator Ted Cruz.\n\nCRUZ: Well, I\u2019ve been leading the fight in the Oval Office, and the Mensheviks.\n\nMODERATOR: Former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina.\n\nFIORINA: One has something to do anything to solve the problem.\n\nMODERATOR: Former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee.\n\nHUCKABEE: Just today \u2014 just today, there was a little kid, we eradicated it.\n\nMODERATOR: Ohio Governor John Kasich.\n\nKASICH: Now, let me respond.\n\nMODERATOR: Kentucky Senator Rand Paul.\n\nPAUL: He was asked whether or not Iran has complied.\n\nMODERATOR: Florida Senator Marco Rubio.\n\nRUBIO: It\u2019s called the mainstream media who every single time it\u2019s ever been tried.\n\nMODERATOR: And Mr. Donald Trump.\n\nTRUMP: Jeb said \u2014 was you\u2019re going to come in legally.\n\nFrom there, the moderator begins asking a series of questions to the candidates, giving them ample time to respond. These were some of the best exchanges that have come up so far.\n\nMODERATOR: Senator, the Tax Foundation says \u2014 it says \u2014 has looked at your competitors, if you were CEO of Hewlett Packard.\n\nRAND PAUL: Every time you did a case, you got a warrant from a position of strength, but I don\u2019t want to put poor people in jail!\n\nMODERATOR: You don\u2019t favor a constitutional shred of capacity for them to do that.\n\nTED CRUZ: We\u2019ll kill the terrorists, we\u2019ll repeal Obamacare, and we won a historic victory saying the World Court, and I give you my word, if I\u2019m elected president, let me say on that \u2014 Rand is exactly right.\n\nMODERATOR: I want to get business-related favors.\n\nMIKE HUCKABEE: And life would be a safe place, and there wouldn\u2019t be punished for their work, and for what they earn, whether it\u2019s the EPA, there is no controversy about the survival of Western civilization.\n\nMODERATOR: Dr. Carson, we know how she will come around the bend, I promise.\n\nBEN CARSON: Negotiate a reasonable minimum wage, and index that so that there is no question that some people go overboard when it comes to trying to divide us, when in fact our strength is in a fantasy world.\n\nMODERATOR: Dana, I want to turn\u2026 \u2026I want to give Mr. Trump\u2026 \u2026 Mr. Trump, 30 seconds.\n\nDONALD TRUMP: We want to go into Iraq, and I think maybe my greatest weakness is that if you look at what\u2019s going in this world by the way, this country from outside, and I think that where he was, and the drugs coming in.\n\nRelated What Cher taught Carrie Brownstein about glamour\n\nMODERATOR: Governor Bush, the tax reform bill that Ronald Reagan signed in 1986 cut the top issues they are talking about you, not surprisingly, come from your tax plan, are there specific steps you would call him left-wing.\n\nJEB BUSH: But we certainly have to make sure that the judgment that you would have thought would have thought would have made the clarity the important thing, and that\u2019s exactly what happened in the book, which is a Mexican-American.\n\nMODERATOR: You\u2019ve said that you \u2014 to the presidential debate starts now.\n\nCHRIS CHRISTIE: Senator Paul, you know, the hugs that I remember are the hugs I remember, and those had nothing to do \u2014 and I don\u2019t disagree with Senator Paul\u2019s position that we need to go at the time was right.\n\nMODERATOR: One minute for answers, 30 seconds to make peace with the logo over your shoulder. Does that sound to you in this campaign, you sat on the East Coast, and the veterans, which you will hear us asking the candidates for tonight\u2019s debate with Facebook.\n\nMARCO RUBIO: He understood what was so special about this for the safety and security of our country and said that you\u2019re going to authorize use of force if you\u2019re running for president because I know the Democrats have the ultimate super PAC, it\u2019s called the Constitution of the Soviet Union was the week that she got exposed as escaping Cuba.\n\nMODERATOR: I \u2026 I understand all of this.\n\nJOHN KASICH: The nominee of this country, some of whom having trouble, you know, when we think about how we respect human rights, because that we don\u2019t want this organization to get it done because I\u2019m realistic.\n\nMODERATOR: Yes, thank you very much.\n\nCARLY FIORINA: There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government should not talk to, because the head of the benefits of a presidential campaign is the highest calling of leadership is not the same as the marijuana that Jeb Bush smoked 40 years ago.\n\nFinally, the moderator wraps things up and gives the candidates an opportunity for one final statement.\n\nMODERATOR: Final statement from each of you. Governor Jeb Bush.\n\nBUSH: The government has tried it their way, and it will be peace through strength.\n\nMODERATOR: Doctor Carson.\n\nCARSON: Real leadership is what happens in our unity.\n\nMODERATOR: Governor Christie.\n\nCHRISTIE: But here\u2019s the news to the funerals.\n\nMODERATOR: Senator Cruz.\n\nCRUZ: The first thing I intend to do is audit the Fed.\n\nMODERATOR: Mrs. Fiorina.\n\nFIORINA: I cut the bureaucracy down to size and power of government.\n\nMODERATOR: Governor Huckabee.\n\nHUCKABEE: I think it is just a blob of tissue?\n\nMODERATOR: Governor Kasich.\n\nKASICH: There\u2019s a \u2014 to keep them in the beginning.\n\nMODERATOR: Senator Paul.\n\nPAUL: The Kurds deserve to be in good hands to be adults and govern and do all this.\n\nMODERATOR: Senator Rubio.\n\nRUBIO: I would go on to add reforms, not just increase the numbers, but add reforms.\n\nMODERATOR: And Mr. Trump.\n\nTRUMP: One of the people that you denied that, and I have opened have thrived.\n\nMODERATOR: Thank you all very much, and that will do it for the first time on October the 13th.\n\nThe algorithmic debate may not always make the most sense, but the gist of what the candidates stand for is there: cutting government spending, repealing Obamacare, and fighting terrorists. There\u2019s just an occasional bit of nonsense added about invading Kentucky and eradicating little kids.\n\nAs long as we keep the script running, these bots will continue to argue with each other and the moderator, generating fresh transcripts forever.\n\nIn that way, the bots are very unlike the real debates: Those only seem to go on forever.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://fusion.net/wp-content/themes/fusion-theme/assets/images/favicons/browserconfig.xml?v=1462067892199", "msapplication-TileColor": "#da532c", "description": "The bots mix together previous debate transcripts to randomly create new transcripts using the candidates' own words", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Fusion", "description": "\"I didn't say that I sound logical also.\" - Dr. Ben Carsonbot", "title": "Presidential Candidates Are Robots, So We Built 11 Bots and Held Our Own GOP Debate", "url": "http://fusion.net/story/228183/debate-bots-endless-transcript/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://i2.wp.com/fusion.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/gettyimages-137354238.jpg?resize=1200%2C630&quality=80&strip=all", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"I didn't say that I sound logical also.\" - Dr. Ben Carsonbot", "title": "Presidential candidates are robots, so we built 11 bots and held our", "url": "http://fusion.net/story/228183/debate-bots-endless-transcript/", "image": "http://i2.wp.com/fusion.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/gettyimages-137354238.jpg?resize=560%2C294&quality=80&strip=all", "site": "@fusion", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Fusion.net", "pocket-site-verification": "81a5587d6c56043280b2554922f43d", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6a5260d31ead375c331934cb6df4833"}, "fb": {"app_id": 796694167041552}, "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://fusion.net/wp-content/themes/fusion-theme/assets/images/favicons/mstile-144x144.png?v=1462067892199", "application-name": "Fusion.net", "article": {"author": "http://www.facebook.com/phogan"}, "msvalidate.01": "0EABD001D404EA9DDE2025E9E4F14CAF", "google-site-verification": "BKw_9qDU04u2w1WoNF53fplAwWXVK_DJ1b6rZDR5u-M", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "2016 presidential elections, debates, Markov chains, bots, transcript, fake debate, simulated debate"}, "article_summary": "We made a group of bots that attempt to simulate a fresh, never-seen-before debate transcript, generated from the debates that have already occurred.\nFormer Florida Governor Jeb Bush.\nGovernor Jeb Bush.\nWith the bots programmed, we launched our own debate.\nMODERATOR: Dana, I want to turn\u2026 \u2026I want to give Mr. Trump\u2026 \u2026 Mr. Trump, 30 seconds."}
