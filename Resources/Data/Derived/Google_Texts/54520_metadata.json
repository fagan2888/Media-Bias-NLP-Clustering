Before it left for Mercurial territory it observed something much closer to home: Earth. One year after its launch MESSENGER took this image.\n\nThough the red you see may suggest something more sinister, it is far from a representation of impending doom. In fact this red is actually growth, plant growth. According to NASA the image is of South America along with parts of Africa and North America, and was taken from the \u201cMercury Dual Imaging System\u2019s wide-angle camera.\u201d NASA explains why the camera\u2019s image shows up red:\n\n\u201c[IT] records light at eleven different wavelengths, including visible and infrared light. Combining blue, red, and green light results in a true-color image from the observations. The image substitutes infrared light for blue light in the three-band combination. The resulting image is crisper than the natural color version because our atmosphere scatters blue light. Infrared light, however, passes through the atmosphere with relatively little scattering and allows a clearer view.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Seeing red?
