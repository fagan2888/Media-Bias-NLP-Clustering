She said the chief message she took from Tuesday\u2019s election, which saw Democrats eviscerated at all levels, is that voter suppression was a problem.\n\n\u201cTo succeed, we must inspire, educate and remove obstacles to participation. Only by changing our political environment and broadening the universe of the electorate can we build a strong sense of community and an economy that works for everyone,\u201d she said. The Californian is likely to get her colleagues\u2019 support to remain as their leader, and Senate Democrats\u2019 leader, Sen. Harry Reid, has indicated he will stay on as they shift to the minority, meaning that despite devastating losses in both chambers, Democrats will keep their leadership team intact.\n\nReid will lose his post as Majority Leader to pro-life Sen. Mitch McConnell after Republicans won enough seats to take over the Senate, but he plans to stay on as the Minority Leader and top Democrat. However, one report indicates he may not have as much support as he had had int he past from his pro-abortion caucus.\n\nWhen Senate Democrats meet for the first time next week since Election Day, Harry Reid is expected to easily win reelection as their leader. He\u2019s raised millions of dollars for his colleagues, served as the public face of GOP disgust and tried, though failed, to protect some of his colleagues by blocking legislation from votes in the past year.

Reid (D-Nev.) still enjoys the support of his top three lieutenants, Sens. Richard Durbin (D-Ill.), Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Patty Murray (D-Wash.), who said through aides on Wednesday that they will back him again. Other rank-and-file Democrats are expected to close ranks. In the words of Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), \u201cIt\u2019s his \u2014 if he still wants it.\u201d But a small group of moderates who say they have a deeply principled, if naive belief that they\u2019re supposed to be legislating on a regular basis, will head into closed-door meetings with the hope of extracting assurances that Democrats will be more willing to cut deals with members of both parties and allow votes on all sorts of legislation. They have very little sway over operations of the Senate, but see the results of Tuesday\u2019s elections a signal that things must change quickly. Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.), a first-term senator who\u2019s clashed with top leaders before, declined twice during an interview on Wednesday to express support for Reid. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to have a discussion about how we move forward and I think until we have that discussion, I don\u2019t think anyone should be making any judgements about leadership,\u201d she said. Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W. Va.) was especially explicit, calling the Democratic defeat \u201ca real ass-whuppin.\u201d\n\nReid has done pro-abortion President Barack Obama\u2019s bidding and ensured that abortion-funding Obamacare was passed through on a party-line vote, with not a single Republican voting in favor of the legislation. Reid made sure that no pro-life bills received a vote in the Senate \u2014 including measures to stop taxpayer funding of abortions and a bill to ban abortions after 20 weeks, when unborn babies can feel pain.\n\nWith Republicans winning the Senate, pro-life advocates will have control of both the House and Senate and a real opportunity to pass pro-life bills or put pro-life language in must-pass legislation in a way that would force pro-abortion President Barack Obama to either sign the bills or veto them and face intense pro-life opposition.\n\nIf there is one main takeaway from Tuesday\u2019s mid-term elections, it\u2019s the fact that the phoney, baloney \u201cwar on women\u201d is over. Planned Parenthood, NARAL, and their pro-abortion allies have desperately tried to tag pro-life groups and candidates with the anti-woman tag by claiming the oppose women by virtue of the fact that they oppose abortion and being forced to pay for abortion-causing drugs.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Nancy Pelosi Vows to Stay Democratic Leader, Calls Pro-Life Victory \"Voter Suppression\"", "og": {"site_name": "LifeNews.com", "description": "House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi says she want to remain the top Democrat in the House, announcing she will run again for her leadership position.Her take o", "title": "Nancy Pelosi Vows to Stay Democratic Leader, Calls Pro-Life Victory \u201cVoter Suppression\u201d", "url": "http://www.lifenews.com/2014/11/06/nancy-pelosi-vows-to-stay-democratic-leader-calls-pro-life-victory-voter-suppression/", "image": "http://www.lifenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/nancypelosipic2-190x105.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 204509779594999}, "OBKey": "avejq02j7xRr+0owuq+Pcw==", "keywords": "nancy pelosi vows to stay democratic leader,calls pro-life victory \"voter suppression\",calls pro-life victory voter suppression", "google-site-verification": "PPPx-GD0i7nWjUFAYnFdOYorAAJLuNyKOl23JCeXyrQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb1ba\"", "article_summary": "When Senate Democrats meet for the first time next week since Election Day, Harry Reid is expected to easily win reelection as their leader.\nShe said the chief message she took from Tuesday\u2019s election, which saw Democrats eviscerated at all levels, is that voter suppression was a problem.\nReid will lose his post as Majority Leader to pro-life Sen.
