Slavitt is accused of misrepresenting the amount of money and implying the funds were returned because of improper spending by states.\n\n\u201cCMS did not recover any of the funds due to improper spending,\u201d the report states. \u201cInstead of recouping funds from the exchanges, CMS simply \u2018de-obligated\u2019 these funds because the time for the grant had expired or the funds were no longer needed.\u201d\n\nSome Republicans want the administration to recoup some of the money from the exchanges that were poorly run. Maryland gave back $32.5 million, along with its web contractor, Nordian, according to the Washington Times. The website crashed within minutes of its launch and experienced multiple problems afterward.\n\nEarlier this week three of President Obama\u2019s former speechwriters joked on the Charlie Rose Show about including in his speech the line about people being able to keep their healthcare.\n\n\u201cIf you like your healthcare plan, you can keep your health care plan,\u201d Obama said in a speech before The Affordable Health Act was implemented.\n\nBut, most policies were canceled due to the regulations.\n\nThis comes as insurers in some states are asking regulators for premium increases. In Virginia, Carefirst BlueCross BlueShield wants a 25 percent premium increase. Providence Health in Oregon is asking for almost 30 percent.\n\nMassive hikes are expected just a week before the November election, as reported by Breitbart. The cost of tax credits to subsidize insurers will go up also, and is expected to hit $105 billion by 2025.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The House Energy and Commerce Committee has accused a top official in the Obama Administration of misleading Congress about Obamacare.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "title": "Top official accused of misleading Congress regarding Obamacare", "og": {"site_name": "TRUNEWS with Rick Wiles", "description": "The House Energy and Commerce Committee has accused a top official in the Obama Administration of misleading Congress about Obamacare.", "title": "Top official accused of misleading Congress regarding Obamacare", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 593, "identifier": "http://www.trunews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/obamacare.jpg", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2016-05-11T11:59:20-04:00", "url": "http://www.trunews.com/top-official-accused-of-misleading-congress-regarding-obamacare/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "TRUNEWS with Rick Wiles", "description": "The House Energy and Commerce Committee has accused a top official in the Obama Administration of misleading Congress about Obamacare.", "card": "summary", "title": "Top official accused of misleading Congress regarding Obamacare"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 107546629279454, "app_id": 107546629279454}, "msvalidate.01": "F6797679D7E81DB3F5C960F7552EF745", "article": {"publisher": "http://facebook.com/trunews", "section": "Featured", "tag": "ticker", "published_time": "2016-05-11T11:51:40-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-11T11:59:20-04:00"}}, "article_summary": "(TRUNEWS) The House Energy and Commerce Committee has accused a top official in the Obama Administration of misleading Congress about Obamacare.\nAccording to the Washington Free Beacon, Slavitt testified that the exchanges returned over $200 million in grant money to the feds.\nIn December, Andy Slavitt the acting administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services was questioned about how state-based exchanges under Obamacare spent federal grant money.\nSlavitt is accused of misrepresenting the amount of money and implying the funds were returned because of improper spending by states.\nThe agency sent in documents requested by the committee and found the agency had only recovered $21.5 million from the state exchanges."}
