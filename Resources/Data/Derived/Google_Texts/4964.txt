ProCon.org President, Kamy Akhavan, said "Given the partisanship and emotion that seems to be feeding many discussions on Obamacare, we are happy to provide easy to read and free research on what is in Obamacare and whether or not it is good for America. Whether people love Obamacare or hate it, we believe that a nonpartisan review of Obamacare is important to many of the 300+ million residents of the United States."
