A two-time Cup with Colorado, Forsberg ranks among all-time NHL leaders in points per game (eighth at 1.25) and assists per game (fifth at .90). Few players in the game\u2019s history played with the Swede\u2019s combination of exceptional vision and physical style. Forsberg won the Hart Trophy in 2002-03, was a first-team all-star three times and also won the Art Ross and Calder trophies.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve said this before: Forsberg was the most talented player I ever saw in his prime \u2014 that I covered, in his prime, anyway.
