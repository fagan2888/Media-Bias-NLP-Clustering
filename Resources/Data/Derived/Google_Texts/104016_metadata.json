From Politico\u2019s profile of the president at the second midterm:\n\n\u201cObama, for so long the man with the bright future, has hated being relegated to a sidelined pariah in the midterms\u2014even if it is the inevitable lot of a second-termer with approval ratings hovering in the low 40s\u2014according to a dozen current and former Obama advisers we spoke with in recent days. He both resents the narrative that he\u2019s basically irrelevant and doesn\u2019t much relish the fact that many of his longest-serving staffers, the remnant core of his once-buzzing and brash White House, are strapping themselves to ejector seats. More than anything, Obama\u2019s loathing for Washington, an attitude that reads as ennui to outsiders, has hardened into a sullen resignation at being trapped in a broken system he failed to change, advisers told us.\u201d\n\nFor all the talk that this midterm election was about nothing, 2014 really was just about one thing: Barack Obama\u2019s failure to live up to his presidency\u2019s promise in almost every domestic and foreign policy arena. The incredible revisionism at the heart of the media coverage we should expect to see from now to the end of this presidency and beyond is that Obama even tried to deliver on the change he promised, to fix the brokenness of a nation and a political and economic scene. Looking back, Obama\u2019s delusion is readily apparent: he apparently believed not that he could change Washington, but that his mere presence would change Washington \u2013 that the fact of his election would roll back the waters and reveal a fundamental sea change in American history, such that the nation\u2019s politics and culture would have no choice but to change in response.\n\nWhen did President Obama ever attempt to govern as he preached? When did he ever put the effort into attempts at the grand bipartisan achievement? Where did he ever subjugate domestic political priorities to any decision about the future of the country? From Obamacare to Immigration to telling Eric Cantor Republicans would have no say in the stimulus because \u201cI won\u201d, his record is at odds with his promise. Obama\u2019s only bipartisan achievement of significance \u2013 the budget control act \u2013 was marked by a series of public temper tantrums attacking the deal, rather than using it as a demonstration of how he could bring people together.\n\nNow the president is full of resentment, fatalistic, irritated at being ignored or disrespected by his people and The People. But this doesn\u2019t come from long years of attempts to bring the parties together to forge compromise \u2013 it comes from his realization that he\u2019d rather golf than put up with the demands of the job. If Obama truly thought that politics only consists of getting elected, he was truly na\u00efve about the demands of the presidency \u2013 just as he has been na\u00efve about the nature of the Republican Party, conservatism and libertarianism, party and congressional politics, the public\u2019s desire for wage growth and job security, even middle eastern dictators\u2019 and terrorists\u2019 assessment of their own interests.\n\nThe stunning part is the nature of this na\u00efvet\u00e9. It is not that it is the high-minded academic view of a cloistered college professor \u2013 it\u2019s the na\u00efvet\u00e9 of a dim-witted screenwriter, an acceptance of an beau ideal of the American presidency that is most recognizable as an invention of Aaron Sorkin, not a reflection of history. The president who walks into the room, says \u201cI am the Lord your God\u201d, and wins the argument. Only in the world of Andrew Shepard or Jed Bartlet does the president demolish his adversaries and win major political battles merely by reading his lines. But no matter: after he leaves office, we\u2019ll be treated to an unprecedented revisionism tour, framing him as facing a political environment tougher than anything since Abraham Lincoln; how Republican opposition was all about racism, but he held back saying so to protect the American people from that fractious debate; how Hillary and the Clinton team was always working against him and key staffers were in cahoots with her all along. Get ready, because we\u2019ll be hearing this for years.", "article_metadata": {"item-publish-date": "Tue, 04 Nov 2014 08:49:46 EDT", "og": {"site_name": "The Federalist", "description": "2014 was about one thing: Barack Obama\u2019s failure to live up to his presidency\u2019s promise in almost every domestic and foreign policy arena.", "title": "This Was An Election About A Failed Presidency", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/3003122896_6fc69cb06e_o.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-11-04T09:53:49+00:00", "url": "http://thefederalist.com/2014/11/04/this-was-an-election-about-a-failed-presidency/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Federalist", "description": "2014 was about one thing: Barack Obama\u2019s failure to live up to his presidency\u2019s promise in almost every domestic and foreign policy arena.", "creator": "@bdomenech", "image": {"src": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/3003122896_6fc69cb06e_o.jpg"}, "title": "This Was An Election About A Failed Presidency", "site": "@FDRLST", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "2014,Aaron Sorkin,Barack Obama,Editors Picks,hope and change,Midterm Election", "published_time": "2014-11-04T08:49:46+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-04T09:53:49+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "2014 was about one thing: Barack Obama\u2019s failure to live up to his presidency\u2019s promise in almost every domestic and foreign policy arena."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1dbd\"", "article_summary": "As President Obama watches the returns this evening, it will be with the building resentment of an executive closer to the end than the beginning.\nWhen did President Obama ever attempt to govern as he preached?\nNow the president is full of resentment, fatalistic, irritated at being ignored or disrespected by his people and The People.\nIt is not that it is the high-minded academic view of a cloistered college professor \u2013 it\u2019s the na\u00efvet\u00e9 of a dim-witted screenwriter, an acceptance of an beau ideal of the American presidency that is most recognizable as an invention of Aaron Sorkin, not a reflection of history.\nThe president who walks into the room, says \u201cI am the Lord your God\u201d, and wins the argument."}
