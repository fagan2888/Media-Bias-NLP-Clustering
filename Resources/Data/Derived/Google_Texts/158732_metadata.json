Wolf\n\nFederal agencies have expanded workplace regulations significantly in recent years and now 70 percent of retailers say they feel overwhelmed, according to a survey published Monday.\n\nEmployers are faced with countless regulations that dictate how their business can be run. Regulations range from workplace safety to how they are allowed to sell products and services. The regulatory burden on businesses has also grown significantly over the years. The National Retail Federation found mostemployers feel overwhelmed by the large amount of regulations.\n\n\u201cSeven in 10 feel \u2018overwhelmed\u2019 by regulations, rules and mandates such as labor regulations, health care mandates, tax codes and safety guidelines,\u201d the survey noted. \u201cAs the compliance burden grows, they worry that employees will suffer. Two-thirds of retail small business owners fear they will have to cut benefits for workers because of the increasing costs of regulatory compliance.\u201d\n\nThe mountain of regulations has caused other problems for retailers as well. Employers feel they are forced to avert time and resources away from their primary business operations to make sure they are in compliance with the law. Additionally 66 percent say the regulations are not easy to understand.\n\n\u201cThe spread of regulations adds a new and growing burden to their workload,\u201d the survey continued. \u201cA majority of retail small business owners (79%) worry about maintaining compliance with regulation, and a quarter (24%) do not believe they are even aware of all the regulations affecting their business.\u201d\n\nThe Department of Labor (DOL), the Environmental Protection Agency and Health and Human Services all have major regulatory footprints. They also all issue regulations that impact how businesses function. The survey found retailers are most concerned about tax regulations, healthcare and workplace safety.\n\n\u201cNearly three in four (73%) cited concerns about complexities in the tax code,\u201d the survey noted. \u201cMore than half (64%) expressed concern about the Affordable Care Act and a majority (60%) cited safety and similar occupational regulations.\u201d\n\nRegulations come with an assortment of added costs. It requires increased paperwork, hours spent implementing and maintaining the new rule and enforcement. The costs are often very small but when added together can increase overall regulatory spending significantly.\n\nThe DOL did not respond to a request for comment by TheDCNF.\n\nFollow Connor on Twitter\n\nClick here for reuse options!
