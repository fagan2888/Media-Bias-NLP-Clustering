A New Delhi court has found four men guilty of rape and murder in the case of a 23-year-old woman assaulted on a bus as it drove through the Indian capital in December. Mukesh Singh, Vinay Sharma, Pawan Gupta and Akshay Kumar Singh face a possible death penalty when they are sentenced.\n\nJudge Yogesh Khanna\u2019s decision may help provide a sense of closure for the woman\u2019s family and friends. But for India, the struggle to stop violence against women is far from over.\n\nUnder Indian laws and court rulings in this case, we \u2013 and the rest of the media \u2013 aren\u2019t allowed to name the woman who died. But we shouldn\u2019t let her case, or those of thousands of other women raped here every year, be forgotten.\n\nFor India, much hard work remains to turn the world\u2019s largest democracy into a place that is not only safe for women, but where women are able to contribute fully to society and the economy. Nothing less than the country\u2019s ability to pull itself out of poverty hangs in the balance.\n\nIndia\u2019s daughters face systematic discrimination. They receive less schooling and have lower rates of literacy than men. They have fewer opportunities to work in the modern sectors of the economy. They have less freedom than men to make choices in their lives.\n\nChanging that will require serious rethinking in the halls of government, in courts, schools and police stations. It also means change in Indian homes.\n\nAs the mother of the woman who died after being raped in December put it: \u201cFirst, we have to change ourselves. Until we change the mindset in our homes, this will continue.\u201d\n\nThat is India\u2019s challenge.\n\nRead an extract of WSJ\u2019s e-book \u201cCrimes Against Women: Three Tragedies and the Call for Reform in India\u201dhere.
