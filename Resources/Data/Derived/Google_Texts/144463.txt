A high-speed chase on Thursday that led police, Choctaw County Deputies, tribal police and Oklahoma Highway Patrol Troopers to the Choctaw Casino in Grant, Oklahoma, ended in a shootout. According to NBC affiliate KTEN news, the suspect was pronounced dead at the scene.

At 2:45 p.m. on Thursday, police responded to a tip that the suspect, who was later identified as William Lee Honea of Yantis, Texas, and had warrants for his arrest, was at the Choctaw Casino, KTEN said. When the man learned that he was being pursued by authorities, he stole a truck in order to flee, police said. The chase led authorities up and down US-271 and on county roads.

No officers were injured, but officials said Honea had a rifle when he got out of the truck and shots were exchanged.

"The trooper engaged him, tactical vehicle intervention, the subject ran off the roadway to the right and crashed right here at the Choctaw Casino," said OHP Lt. Shawn Pierce told News 12 KXII.
