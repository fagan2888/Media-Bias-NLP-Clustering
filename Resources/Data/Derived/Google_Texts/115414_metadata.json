(It basically went down like this all over again.) More words on that to follow in our print pages, but for now, here\u2019s your beautiful weekend forecast, which includes reunions, education, and a trek to Astoria. (Where I\u2019ll be indulging in queer nightlife for the first time.) (I mean, I\u2019ve taken in lots of gay nightlife, clearly, just not on the coast.) (Should I be scared?) Let\u2019s get on with it:\n\nThursday\n\nClass is in Session! The Impact of Health Care Reform. Naughty substitute teacher Madame Anita DuMoore is going to take us to school in Miss Alexis Campbell Starr\u2019s gym class. Here\u2019s your chance to hear about the Affordable Care Act, and what it really means to the LGBTQ community, including how you can get enrolled for health care with assistance from Cascade AIDS Project\u2019s Cover Oregon team. Here\u2019s what you can expect: Confessional storytelling, guest speakers on a variety of LGBTQ health topics, musical numbers, prizes, free food, beer/wine available to purchase, and a Q&A where CAP answers all of your \u201cburning\u201d questions. Ouch! That burns. 6:30pm, Old Town Floyd\u2019s, 118 NW Couch.\n\nAfter class, you need to go see the very last Dragathon (and see who\u2019s crowned winner!) and catch karaoke with Gula Delgatto at Crush (see above).\n\nFriday\n\nPortland\u2019s rising stars Minden put on their hot as hell keyboard-spangled funk party followed by Magic Mouth\u2019s soulful, multi-hyphenate funk-punk, gospel-ish fervor set. This show isn\u2019t something to overlook. 9pm, White Owl Social Club, 1305 SE 8th. $6.\n\nCD release! Urban Wildlife will release their latest album \u201cStrangers\u201d at The Secret Society\u2013the wonderful Swansea will open. Please come out and celebrate with us\u2013and click the links to hear the bands\u2019 hauntingly pleasurable music. (And click on the CD release link to your left for more details.) 9pm, The Secret Society, 116 NE Russell. $5.\n\nSaturday\n\nShhh, this party is kind of a secret.\n\nAttn: Southern Oregon! Attn! Did you miss the last Caravan of Glam show? Here\u2019s your chance to catch it. Hosted by Portland\u2019s hottest and finest mistress of ceremonies, Ecstasy Inferno. Staring Maliena B ItchCock, Faye Kit-Knightly, The Late Night Delights Harem and special guests from out of town. Why don\u2019t you get yourself on out to the club and show them how Southern Oregon parties. (Portland\u2019s darlings include Artemis Chase and Isaiah Tillman, for starters.) 9pm, Taroko, Ashland. (I assume you locals know where the hell that is.) $10.\n\nThis though, locals, is pretty much everything. Blow Pony takes on Sissyboys and Booty. Oh, you\u2019re 23 and don\u2019t know what the hell that means? Let me enlighten you: \u201cFor those of you who have not heard of the infamous Booty nights at the old Porky\u2019s on Lombard, nights where queers gathered in a space with performance, beats, bodies\u2013so many homos it was elbow-to-elbow with sweaty hot madness. When Booty ended it was a huge moment for many of us who were used to the weekly North Portland homo hangout, a place where bears, dykes, gender benders, queens and kings, and pretty much everything else could be seen. There\u2019s never been anything like it since, and truth be told from the ashes of Booty rose Blow Pony. (And many a queer mixer/dance night.)\u201d\n\nSaturday will be hosted by Sissyboy, the legendary queer performance troupe. (Watch that trailer to your left if you\u2019re somehow unfamiliar.) These queens have been gone for awhile now, but their mark remains, and they\u2019re still referenced and revered\u2013and doing all kinds of great shit everywhere. If it seems like I\u2019m dedicating a lot of words to these people, it\u2019s because I am. This is our history. 9pm, Rotture, 315 SE 3rd. $5.\n\nMeanwhile, in Astoria, Dragalution. \u201cIt\u2019s that time to let our freak flags fly! Come join Daylight Cums and her sexy bastards as they put on a show guaranteed to excite\u2013there will be a dance party, Jell-O shots, lots of costumes and sexy, sexy times.\u201d Yay! Read all about what the hell is going on right here. I\u2019m going to be experiencing it for the first time and I couldn\u2019t be more excited. 9:30pm, Columbian Theater, 11th & Marine.\n\nSunday\n\nFirst off, there\u2019s the closing reception for Bury My Art at Wounded Knee: Blood & Guts in the Art School Industrial Complex:\n\nMoving along\u2026 Queens for Camp: As we wrap up the first month of this new year, join some of the finest queens in town (and singers and dancers too?) as we get together to raise funds for Cascade AIDS Project\u2018s Camp KC. Our end of the month deal for you is the very affordable $5 suggested donation. And with doors at 5 and show at 6, it\u2019s a great way to start your Sunday party. Plus, Poison Waters! You\u2019ve never beheld such glory. 5pm, Darcelle\u2019s, 208 NW Third.\n\nAnd after that show, head on over to see the Superstar Divas (where Honey Bea and Bolivia will wow and titillate you) and inch closer to finding out who\u2019ll be crowned Ginger Lee\u2019s replacement! (Gone but not forgotten.) The contestants from the weeks-long Drag Race Hunger Games will perform some group numbers\u2013and then it\u2019s: Oh my, look at this poster for next Sunday, the 2nd\u2013a night the Downtown Browns hijack the show for one evening of magic (then we find out the winner!):\n\nMaybe I already know who wins! (I don\u2019t.)\n\nTuesday\n\nWhatever, so I\u2019m cheating\u2013Tuesday isn\u2019t so much the weekend, but I do not want you to miss out on this Friends and Family night benefiting Camp KC. (Yes, we love Camp KC.) This night, McMenamins will be donating 50% of sales from the restaurants and bars inside the Crystal Hotel\u2013all of it goes to the kids camp. Hot damn! Plus, there\u2019s also a happy hour show. Check it out here.\n\nShare and Enjoy\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "article_metadata": {"description": "But for now, here's your beautiful weekend forecast, which includes reunions, education, and a trek to Astoria.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Proud Queer (PQ Monthly \u2013 Daily Online)", "description": "By Daniel Borgen, PQ Monthly I\u2019m a little behind because I was away on a homosexual retreat at the beautiful Horse Creek Lodge this ...", "title": "Sissyboy/Booty Invasion + Your Weekend Forecast!", "url": "http://www.pqmonthly.com/sissyboybooty-invasion-weekend-forecast/18216", "image": "http://www.pqmonthly.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/bp2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 498999850118547}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1b55\"", "article_summary": "More words on that to follow in our print pages, but for now, here\u2019s your beautiful weekend forecast, which includes reunions, education, and a trek to Astoria.\nThere\u2019s never been anything like it since, and truth be told from the ashes of Booty rose Blow Pony.\nTuesdayWhatever, so I\u2019m cheating\u2013Tuesday isn\u2019t so much the weekend, but I do not want you to miss out on this Friends and Family night benefiting Camp KC.\nBy Daniel Borgen, PQ MonthlyI\u2019m a little behind because I was away on a homosexual retreat at the beautiful Horse Creek Lodge this last holiday weekend.\nNaughty substitute teacher Madame Anita DuMoore is going to take us to school in Miss Alexis Campbell Starr\u2019s gym class."}
