The Citadel defense played well against an offense that featured a mixture of backfield combinations. Junior Dominique Allen, the returning starter at quarterback, played a limited role with a majority of snaps with both the first and second units being taken by redshirt freshman Jordan Black.\n\n\n\nAfter making it through 12 spring practices without major injury, head coach Brent Thompson used a format that invited competition without unnecessary risk. The Bulldogs played offense vs. defense and had live field goals but did not kick off or return punts. A running clock was used during the first half before normal clock operation in the second half with many starters on both sides of the ball watching from the sideline.\n\n\n\nThe spring game also was the beginning of the 2016 season ticket campaign, and it was announced that this year's season ticket holder gift is a commemorative replica Southern Conference championship ring. One ring will be included for every two season ticket packages purchased. To order season tickets or for more information, call The Citadel Athletic Ticket Office at 843-953-DOGS (3647).\n\n\n\nThe Bulldogs conclude spring practice next week by holding their final two practices Tuesday and Thursday.\n\n\n\nThe Citadel begins defense of its 2015 Southern Conference co-championship with two straight SoCon games, beginning at Mercer on Sept. 1 before the home opener Sept. 10 against Furman, which also is the Bulldogs' Military Appreciation game.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "Bulldogs complete 12 spring practices", "og": {"url": "http://www.live5news.com/story/31519362/the-citadel-holds-spring-football-game", "image": "http://wcsc.images.worldnow.com/images/10145021_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Bulldogs complete 12 spring practices", "title": "The Citadel holds Spring Football game"}, "twitter": {"account_id": 16813752, "title": "The Citadel holds Spring Football game", "image": "http://wcsc.images.worldnow.com/images/10145021_G.jpg", "creator": "@Live5News", "site": "@Live5News", "card": "summary", "description": "Bulldogs complete 12 spring practices"}, "wnreadableurl": "the-citadel-holds-spring-football-game", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "owner": "WCSC", "fb": {"admins": 644426401, "app_id": 739226082784217}, "date": "2016/03/19", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/live5news"}, "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS09"}, "article_summary": "The Citadel football team held its annual Spring Game, presented by Coke Zero, inside Johnson Hagood Stadium on Saturday afternoon.\nThe Citadel defense played well against an offense that featured a mixture of backfield combinations.\nThe spring game also was the beginning of the 2016 season ticket campaign, and it was announced that this year's season ticket holder gift is a commemorative replica Southern Conference championship ring.\nThe Bulldogs played offense vs. defense and had live field goals but did not kick off or return punts.\nOne ring will be included for every two season ticket packages purchased."}
