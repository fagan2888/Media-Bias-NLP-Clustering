SUGAR HOUSE, Utah (ABC 4 Utah) – Thirty-five families are learning their Christmas debts have disappeared. An anonymous donor paid off every remaining layaway balance at a local toy store.



About $600—that is the amount of Toys “R” Us merchandise 34 year-old Amy Floyd put on layaway this holiday season. The Sugar House mom is a single parent of three young children.



“... and I actually have two with autism with special needs,” Floyd told Good 4 Utah's Ali Monsen.



Floyd says it is always a struggle making ends meet, especially during Christmastime. She recently went to her local Toys “R” Us to pay off her remaining debt.



"I actually was thinking, on the way [there], of dropping some things off, because I couldn't afford the last amount that was due,” Floyd explained.



Floyd says she approached the casheirs and asked to adjust her order. That is when a manager handed her an unexpected recepit.



"It says, 'Paid in full,' and they're bringing out the boxes of everything...” she recalled.



An anonymous donor had paid off every remaining layaway balance at the store—a total of 35 accounts and more than $5,800 dollars.



“I can't believe it—that somebody else would do that for me... I just kept crying,” Floyd said.



Now, the grateful mother is heading back in to Toy's “R” Us, this time, shopping for someone else's kids.



"I've been lucky enough to have this money that I don't have to use anymore for my children. I need to find another family in need...” Floyd explained.



Floyd says she has no idea who this Secret Santa is, but that his/her generosity is a 'Christmas Miracle' she will never forget.



"Thank you so much, I can't believe it. Thank you, I appreciate it beyond any words I could express. Thank you,” Floyd reiterated.
