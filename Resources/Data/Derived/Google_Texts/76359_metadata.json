FBR made a comeback during the go-go real estate days, but faded again during the Great Recession.\n\nThe principals behind the firm\u2019s initials \u2014 Emanuel J. Friedman, Eric F. Billings and W. Russell Ramsey \u2014 are no longer involved in day-to-day operations. But after years of retrenchment that saw hundreds lose their jobs, FBR shows signs of rising again.\n\nAnd it seems to be following a familiar playbook. Last week, FBR announced that it had acquired a team of nearly 30 professionals from Lazard Capital Markets to make new inroads into the health-care sector, an industry very much in the spotlight with the advent of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nRichard J. Hendrix, FBR chairman and chief executive, said that adding health care strengthens the firm\u2019s investment business, both from a trading and underwriting standpoint, and broadens its areas of expertise. FBR focuses on providing investment banking, merger and acquisition, brokerage and research services to companies known as small-cap firms.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to be the best small-cap equities firm in the country, and I think this addition makes that a realistic target and goal,\u201d Hendrix said.\n\nThe move follows the September hiring of two merger-and-acquisition specialists to bolster FBR\u2019s investment banking group. In June, specialty and retail analyst Susan Anderson signed on as a vice president.\n\nThe Lazard Capital Markets team, which includes six senior research analysts, six sales traders, three position traders and four institutional salesmen, will work primarily in health care but also augment FBR\u2019s work in the media sector.\n\nRumors that Lazard Capital Markets was exploring a sale or other alternatives led FBR to enter into discussions with the closely held brokerage firm.\n\n\u201cWe have looked at other health-care opportunities over the last few years, but there just wasn\u2019t a good fit for a variety of reasons,\u201d Hendrix said. \u201cHealth care was clearly the biggest piece of [Lazard Capital Markets\u2019] business. It was a place they were really highly regarded and a place that we wanted to build from a franchise standpoint, so it was a very good fit.\u201d\n\nFBR had made forays into the health-care sector in the past without much success. In 2008, it laid off its 11-member health-care research staff and discontinued its coverage. At the time, Hendrix said the company had been unable to create revenue streams around the research to justify continuing the business.\n\nThe business outlook is improving, however. In the second quarter, FBR reported profit of $81.8 million, or $6.24 per share, for the first half of the year, a big jump from the $900,000, or six cents a share, it reported in the first half of 2012.\n\n\u201cThe company\u2019s in a really good place right now in terms of our earnings profile and the way our balance sheet is structured so that we can be opportunistic,\u201d Hendrix said. \u201cBut there\u2019s nothing in particular that we\u2019re out chasing right now. I think the most important thing is that we make sure that this team that we brought on, we do a good job getting them to become a core part of FBR, and that\u2019s what our focus is going to be for the next six to 12 months.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The world of investment banking can wax and wane with the fortunes of the stock markets, and few know that better than FBR.
