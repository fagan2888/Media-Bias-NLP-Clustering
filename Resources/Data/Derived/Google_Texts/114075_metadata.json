Here is who to watch.\n\nJonathan Ernst/Reuters Our government has failed us\u2014again. Given the debacle over the last 16 days, it\u2019s hard to praise anyone in Washington. Or anything. The shutdown cost the United States $24 billion, according to Standard and Poor\u2019s. Consumer confidence dropped by the largest amount since the 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers. Our partisanship is undermining our international standing and slowing our economy. Worst of all, it starts again in January. Unbowed by poll numbers that show their unpopularity, hard-line Tea Party conservatives are vowing to fight on. \u201cIf the American people continue to rise up,\u201d Texas Republican Ted Cruz declared in the Senate Wednesday after the deal was announced to avoid default and reopen the government. \u201cWe\u2019re going to stop the number-one job killer in this country that is Obamacare.\u201d We need to applaud the Republicans who stood up to Cruz this week: the so-called \u201csanity caucus.\u201d A civil war is underway in the Republican Party. Democrats can vilify Cruz and the Tea Party all they want, but it is only fellow conservatives who can undermine their legitimacy in crimson states and congressional districts.\n\nHere\u2019s a cheat sheet for the post-shutdown Republican party: The sanity caucus: Mitch McConnell, Lindsey Graham, and Lamar Alexander: Facing a Tea Party primary challenge, the Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell first stayed out of the fray. But his last-minute deal with Majority Leader Harry Reid prevented the nation\u2019s first default. Yes, McConnell could have acted sooner. But it was McConnell\u2014more than any other Republican\u2014who prevented a default and crushed Cruz\u2019s hopes for a Tea Party insurrection in the Senate. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Lamar Alexander of Tennessee also deserve credit for supporting a deal while facing Tea Party primary challenges. Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, and Kelly Ayotte: These three Republican senators who hail from states with strong Tea Party movements\u2014Maine, Alaska, and New Hampshire, respectively\u2014spearheaded the effort to embrace a compromise that reopened the government on largely Democratic terms. They are expected to be key players in the fiscal negotiations now scheduled for this fall\u2014and likely to fail. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce: In a rare moment of unity, the pro-business labor organization sent a joint letter with the AFL-CIO and United Way to President Obama and Congress urging an end to the shutdown and a possible default.

Next year\u2019s GOP congressional primaries could be just as interesting as the general election. Grover Norquist: A man loathed by liberals for his no-tax pledge turned on Cruz and his fellow \u201cdefunders\u201d with a vengeance. \u201cIt\u2019d be a good idea if they stopped referring to other Republicans as Hitler appeasers because they opposed the strategy they put forward which failed,\u201d Norquist told reporters on Wednesday. \u201cI think if you make a mistake as big as what they did, you owe your fellow senators and congressmen a big apology\u2014and your constituents, as well.\u201d\n\nCharles Krauthammer, Jennifer Rubin, and Jonah Goldberg: The conservative commentators for the Washington Post and National Review all openly criticized the tactic of shutting down the government to kill Obamacare. Krauthammer called the approach \u201cnuts\u201d and \u201creally dumb.\u201d Goldberg said the idea \u201cworks fantastically well for fundraising when you want to go and run in 2016 for president\u201d but called it a \u201cludicrous\u201d legislative strategy. Rubin called for the GOP\u2019s \u201csanity caucus\u201d to save the party. \u201cThe shutdown strategy\u2019s complete flop should demonstrate to all but those determined to create their own counter-reality that the shutdown squad doesn\u2019t represent the views of voters or even of GOP voters,\u201d she wrote on Tuesday. The kamikaze caucus: Rupert Murdoch and Roger Ailes:record-low approval ratings for the GOP should give Murdoch and Ailes pause. So far, there is little sign of this. Paul Ryan: In what turned out to be an exercise in wishful thinking, I wrote last week that the fiscal conservative might use the debt fight as a way to break from extreme conservatives. I was wrong. Instead, Ryan is trying to have it both ways. Last week, he was one of the first Republicans to drop the defunding of Obamacare as a condition for reopening the government. Yet on Wednesday night, he voted with House conservatives against the bipartisan deal to reopen the government and avoid a default. Ryan and Senator Patty Murray, a Washington Democrat, will co-chair the bipartisan panel of lawmakers charged with developing a long-term budget plan by December 13. Ryan\u2019s no vote on Wednesday suggests that chances of any agreement are low. Marco Rubio: The Florida senator who had courageously embraced immigration reform earlier this year continued the move back to his Tea Party roots during the shutdown. On Wednesday night, Rubio voted against the bipartisan deal. Clearly, Rubio is positioning himself for a 2016 presidential run against Cruz and Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, both of whom also voted against the deal.", "article_metadata": {"description": "With a budget conference forming and a new debt-ceiling hike coming early in 2014, there&#39;s more strife to come.
