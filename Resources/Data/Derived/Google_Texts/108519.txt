$15 Minimum Wage In Florida?

Bills started getting filed for the 2016 legislative session Wednesday, with Sen. Dwight Bullard, D-Miami, proposing a measure (SB 6) that would raise Florida’s minimum wage to $15 an hour.

Bullard filed a somewhat-similar proposal during the 2015 session to raise the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour, but the bill was never taken up in committees. The state’s minimum wage, which gradually increases each year, hit $8.05 in January.
