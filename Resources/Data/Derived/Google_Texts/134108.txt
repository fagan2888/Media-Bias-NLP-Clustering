The Temple Theater was filled with kids, parents and grandparents Saturday to see an adventure-filled movie.

A screening of the movie Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles was shown at the historic theater. This screening was a part of the kid’s zone initiative promoted by the mayor’s office. It's put on to get parents, grandparents and children together for some family fun.

"I think anytime you can come together with the children, and me being a grandmother, I love my grandchildren," grandmother Margie Dean says.

The next kid zone event is scheduled for June 27th and will be held at Magnolia Park.
