A Kansas City, Missouri, rally for Donald Trump has drawn a crowd of people hoping to attend the rally and scores who are there to protest the Republican presidential front-runner.

The line of people hoping to attend the rally at the downtown theater snaked around the block Saturday afternoon. Police officers and barricades in the street separated the rally participants from about 200 protesters on the other side.

Many protesters were chanting "Dump Trump" and "Black Lives Matter." Some Trump supporters responded with obscene gestures.

Trump's rallies in recent weeks have been marked by frequent clashes between his supporters and demonstrators.

Protesters who prompted Trump to call off his Chicago rally Friday night after fights broke out with his supporters are hoping the Kansas City event will be shut down before he takes the stage, too.
