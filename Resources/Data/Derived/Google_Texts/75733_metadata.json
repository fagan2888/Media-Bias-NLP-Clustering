Sort of.\n\n\"You are now a Navy SEAL,\" said Stephen Brown, a member of SEAL Swim Charities.\n\nBJ Correll, a 14-year-old with leukemia, was given quite a surprise when a group of retired SEALs came to his hospital room and made him an honorary member.\n\nAfter doing a middle school project about the SEALs, Correll dreamed of joining.\n\nBut in 2012, Correll was diagnosed with leukemia and began treatment immediately. And with just seven months of treatment left, Correll found out the cancer was back.\n\n\"He's having a hard time right now. We're at our last option,\" Correll's mother told WJZY.\n\nCorrell is now undergoing more chemo to get his second bone-marrow transplant. A GoFundMe campaign to help pay for his medical bills was set up and, as of Tuesday, had raised more than $6,000.\n\nThis video includes images from Getty Images and Facebook / Cure For BJ Round 2.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A 14-year-old battling leukemia for the second time becomes an honorary Navy SEAL.", "og": {"site_name": "Newsy", "description": "A 14-year-old battling leukemia for the second time becomes an honorary Navy SEAL.", "title": "Teen Cancer Survivor Becomes Honorary Navy SEAL", "url": "http://www.newsy.com/videos/teen-cancer-survivor-becomes-honorary-navy-seal/", "image": "http://newsymain.npgroup.netdna-cdn.com/images/videos/m/1450214304.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A 14-year-old battling leukemia for the second time becomes an honorary Navy SEAL.", "title": "Teen Cancer Survivor Becomes Honorary Navy SEAL", "url": "https://www.newsy.com/videos/teen-cancer-survivor-becomes-honorary-navy-seal/", "image": "https://newsymain-npgroup.netdna-ssl.com/images/videos/m/1450214304.jpg", "site": "@newsyvideos", "player": {"width": 400, "identifier": "https://player.ooyala.com/tframe.html?embedCode=tmOWdqeTpPTDAG6Ip_Mnr8S3F97tPMWx&pbid=54ea1c2f14ee44369ddf31ac887ffe7e", "height": 225}, "app": {"url": {"ipad": "newsy://54822", "iphone": "newsy://54822", "googleplay": "com.newsy"}, "name": {"ipad": "Newsy: Video News", "iphone": "Newsy: Video News", "googleplay": "Newsy: Multisource Video News"}, "id": {"ipad": 330879884, "iphone": 330879884, "googleplay": "com.newsy"}}, "card": "player"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "newsy://54822", "app_store_id": 330879884, "app_name": "Newsy: Video News"}}, "msvalidate.01": "675C8D40A5F1E0722AA2D3A33379E884", "fb": {"app_id": 380870506022, "pages": 49978948774}, "google-site-verification": "o36fft0HATmhbZ_GPX4YSOS3EmkTGkPrvNFxQwzcNbY", "keywords": "bj correll,kid with leukemia,navy seals,honorary navy seal,bj correll honorary navy seal,boy fighting cancer,honorary seal leukemia,cure for bj round 2,newsy", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newsyvideos"}, "thumbnail": "http://newsymain.npgroup.netdna-cdn.com/images/videos/m/1450214304.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "\"You are now a Navy SEAL,\" said Stephen Brown, a member of SEAL Swim Charities.\nA 14-year-old battling leukemia for the second time becomes an honorary Navy SEAL.\nThe Navy SEALs have just inducted their youngest member.\nAfter doing a middle school project about the SEALs, Correll dreamed of joining.\nThis video includes images from Getty Images and Facebook / Cure For BJ Round 2."}
