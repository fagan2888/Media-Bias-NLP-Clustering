It will be a long while before we know just how badly the GOP damaged itself by caving to the nativist wing of the party and voting to end President Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program (DACA), which would make the young undocumented immigrants currently protected by that program newly eligible for deportation. But judging by the early reactions, Republicans are going to be haunted by it for a long time.

To recap: Before the August recess, the House Republicans passed a bill to deal with the influx of unaccompanied immigrant minors at the southern border. To secure the conservative support they needed to get it passed, the leadership held a vote on a second bill to eliminate funding for DACA (conservatives argue that the program helped cause the border crisis, even though there’s little reason to believe that’s true).

Since then, Republicans have been catching it hot from immigration activists. This past weekend, Rep. Paul Ryan was at a book signing in Florida where he was confronted by several young people claiming to be beneficiaries of DACA. They wanted to know why Ryan had voted with Rep. Steve King and other hard-line anti-immigrant legislators to terminate the program. Ryan dodged the questions and instead urged them to read his book.

It was actually the second time in the past week that Ryan’s book tour was met by protests from immigration activists.

Paul Ryan’s run-in with DACA beneficiaries follows Steve King’s heated encounter from earlier this month in Iowa, in which a young undocumented immigrant invited King to tear up her identification card. Sen. Rand Paul famously fled the scene of that confrontation before it escalated, but last week he told reporters that he actually sides with King on the issue and supports the House bill.
