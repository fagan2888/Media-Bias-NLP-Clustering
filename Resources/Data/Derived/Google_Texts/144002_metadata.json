And by classier, of course, I mean more explicit, more ironic and with the bigotry more clearly articulated.\n\nMass deportation of undocumented immigrants? Sure, but let\u2019s not forget that Mexicans are, in general, rapists. And murderers.\n\nTraditional one man/one woman marriage? Sure, but let\u2019s not forget that I\u2019ve been married three times and see nothing ironic about this, at all.\n\nPresident Obama isn\u2019t doing enough to fight the Islamic State? Sure, and let\u2019s not forget that I have a secret plan to fight them. It\u2019s massive. It\u2019s brilliant. And I won\u2019t tell you what it is until after I\u2019m elected.\n\nSo it should have come as no surprise that Donald Trump\u2019s health care agenda is pretty much the same as the rest of the Republican field\u2019s, but with a little more flair:\n\nDonald Trump just outlined his health care plan live on @CNN: \"Repeal and replace with something terrific.\" \u2014 Chris Moody (@moody) July 29, 2015\n\nSomething terrific. Great. How had no one thought of that before?\n\nOf course, where Trump may break with his Republican opponents is that, for him, \u201csomething terrific\u201d may actually be more progressive than the health insurance law he says he wants to repeal and replace. As PolitiFact pointed out last week:\n\nThe billionaire\u2019s 2000 book The America We Deserve makes a strong pitch for universal health care. \u201cI\u2019m a conservative on most issues but a liberal on this one,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cWe should not hear so many stories of families ruined by health care expenses. We must not allow citizens with medical problems to go untreated because of financial problems or red tape.\u201d When he turned to how the country might achieve universal coverage, Trump focused like a laser beam on a Canadian-style, single-payer plan. He said it would eliminate many billions of dollars of overhead. \u201cThe Canadian plan also helps Canadians live longer and healthier than America,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe need, as a nation, to reexamine the single-payer plan, as many individual states are doing.\u201d\n\nIt remains to be seen if the rest of the Republican candidates are able to break through the ahistorical bubble Trump has created and call him out for the Marxist, Stalinist, fascist that they\u2019re supposed to think he is now.
