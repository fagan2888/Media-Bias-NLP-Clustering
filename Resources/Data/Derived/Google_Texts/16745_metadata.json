But there\u2019s hope, still, for content that keeps its head above water. Onward, my friends, or backward, perhaps: today marks the 20th anniversary of the White House\u2019s website launch. Elahi Izadi has an illuminating examination of that fateful day, and\u2014good lord\u2014how far we\u2019ve come. Although, I guess if you had to sign up for health care on the Affordable Care Act website\u2026maybe not.\n\nI vaguely remember watching Nightmare on Elm Street when I was about four or five (don\u2019t ask), and have, since then, been a big fat baby when it comes to horror films. At BuzzFeed, Louis Peitzman\u2019s piece on Wes Craven\u2019s New Nightmare, the seventh installment of the meta-fictional Freddy Krueger series, inspects star Heather Langenkamp and Craven\u2019s experience of the film, and the lasting effects of the series as a whole on the horror genre. \u201cWhen Craven wrote the first Nightmare on Elm Street film, critics and fans alike were loudly bemoaning that horror was dead,\u201d writes Peitzman. \u201cSo he gave them something new.\u201d New and memorable, if my dreams are any indication.\n\nAt The Billfold, Amanda Tomas has a terrifying piece about her recent job interview at Handybook. Tech startup interview processes are notoriously difficult, but this is a whole \u2018nother level of awful. Happy Halloween, indeed.\n\nI\u2019ve worked in the food industry for seven years, and I\u2019ve met a lot of incredible people and lasting friends. I\u2019ve also met a lot of jerks, and I\u2019m not unique in that experience. From sexual harassment to demeaning wages (in New York state, the minimum wage for tipped workers is five dollars), restaurant industry workers are definitely survivors. The Daily Dot has a great piece on how to make your waiter\u2019s life a little more pleasant/easy, with such tips as \u201cSay hello!\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t cut in line!\u201d You\u2019d be surprised how many people don\u2019t do those things.\n\nLast night the legendary fashion designer Oscar de la Renta passed away at the age of 82. ELLE has a roundup of 82 of his most heart-stopping looks; Vogue has tender odes by Anna Wintour and Andre Leon Talley, as well as a stunning collection of some of his most famous designs featured in the magazine; and, at Jezebel, Laia Garcia has written perhaps the most beautiful piece of them all, titled \u201cOscar de la Renta Was One of Us\u201d:\n\n\u201cOne of my earliest memories of his work is a picture that ran inVogue: three models sit on a bench in a secret garden that looks like something from the movie, in a world unto their own. They are all wearing matching Oscar gowns\u2014long, silk, and floral-printed, with skirts so big the fabric folds into itself at their feet many times over. Their shoulders are trimmed in matching fur. I am eight, I think, and I cannot stop staring at the picture, getting lost in the fabric, examining the differences between each dresses, ascribing characteristics to each girl, trying on each dress in my head, imagining an ideal version of me. The dresses are inspired by another time\u2014and yet their defiant attitude seems to me resolutely modern.\u201d\n\nThe Oscar de la Renta label will live on, but in a different form and with a different (and hopefully not lesser) magic.", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Today has been a difficult day on\u00a0the Internet, with people dissecting Renee Zellweger's face (LOL except\u00a0NOT), Adobe apparently pulling its ads from Gawker under pressure from #GamerGate, and this tragic mansplain-y piece about mansplaining.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "Flavorwire", "description": "Today has been a difficult day on\u00a0the Internet, with people dissecting Renee Zellweger\u2019s face (LOL except\u00a0NOT), Adobe apparently pulling its ads from Gawker under pressure from #GamerGate, an\u2026", "title": "The White House\u2019s First Website Looked Like It Was Made in the 90\u2019s (and It Was) : Links You Need to See", "url": "http://flavorwire.com/483889/the-white-houses-first-website-looked-like-it-was-made-in-the-90s-and-it-was-links-you-need-to-see", "image": {"width": 513, "identifier": "https://flavorwire.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/white-house.png", "height": 463}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://flavorwire.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/white-house.png?w=640"}, "site": "@flavorwire", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@flavorwire"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "p": {"domain_verify": "d14fb4bfdccbc45ec9b9cf467123426d"}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "application-name": "Flavorwire", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WordPresscom", "published_time": "2014-10-21T21:18:37+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-21T21:19:34+00:00"}, "keywords": "pop culture, food industry, freddy kreuger, halloween, handybook, mansplaining, nightmare on elm street, oscar de la renta, renee zellweger, startups, the internet, the white house, wes craven", "google-site-verification": "LEPlfEAe87ZYYO-w5cvjSSIHi6-qE8orVaxsi6TkE9Y", "news_keywords": "Food industry, Freddy Kreuger, Halloween, Handybook, Mansplaining, Nightmare on Elm Street, Oscar de la Renta, Renee Zellweger, Startups, The Internet, The White House, Wes Craven", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://flavorwire.com/feed;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/5af1ea63c8deb1c43404735fce2401ed?s=16", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/flavorwire-2016/img/ms-icon-144x144.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca3d1\"", "article_summary": "Onward, my friends, or backward, perhaps: today marks the 20th anniversary of the White House\u2019s website launch.\nLast night the legendary fashion designer Oscar de la Renta passed away at the age of 82.\n\u201cWhen Craven wrote the first Nightmare on Elm Street film, critics and fans alike were loudly bemoaning that horror was dead,\u201d writes Peitzman.\nAlthough, I guess if you had to sign up for health care on the Affordable Care Act website\u2026maybe not.\nI\u2019ve worked in the food industry for seven years, and I\u2019ve met a lot of incredible people and lasting friends."}
