But the facts are on their side. Columbus was not just a brutal slaver; he was a pioneer of slavery....\n\nCan you condemn a man just for being a slaver? Of course. It's almost as bad as you can get. And Columbus didn't even have the lame excuses of a Thomas Jefferson, like \"I grew up with it,\" or \"I couldn't afford not to do it.\"\n\nThe lamest excuse of all is that we have to judge Columbus by the standards of his time. For this is nothing but the cultural relativism that defenders of Western civilization so often decry. If some cultures and practices are better than others, then we can fairly hold up a mirror to Columbus and the Spanish conquerors, and find theirs to be among the worst.\n\nBut hasn't the European colonization of the New World been an improvement? Even if this were true, it would be no reason to have a special day to honor Columbus and his ilk. If Mengele had cured cancer, should we celebrate Mengele Day? In any case, you've got to ask: Compared to what? The benefits of Western culture would have spread at least as rapidly if the Europeans had arrived in the New World as traders and teachers instead of conquerors and slavers.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Economist Bryan Caplan, sometime Reason contributor and author of some great consensus-breaking books about voting and child-rearing, speaks up against", "title": "Columbus Day: Libertarian Economist Says the Left is Right to Condemn Columbus", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2014/10/13/columbus-day-libertarian-economist-says", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/mc/_external/2014_10/-20.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/mc/_external/2014_10/-20.jpg", "title": "Columbus Day: Libertarian Economist Says the Left is Right to Condemn Columbus", "description": "Economist Bryan Caplan, sometime Reason\ncontributor and author of some great consensus-breaking books\nabout \nvoting and \nchild-rearing, speaks\nup against that rat bastard Chrisopher Columbus on this\nnati", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@reason"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "article": {"tag": "Culture", "published_time": "2014-10-13T19:52:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/brian-doherty"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf703\"", "article_summary": "If Mengele had cured cancer, should we celebrate Mengele Day?\nEven if this were true, it would be no reason to have a special day to honor Columbus and his ilk.\nColumbus was not just a brutal slaver; he was a pioneer of slavery....Can you condemn a man just for being a slaver?\nThe lamest excuse of all is that we have to judge Columbus by the standards of his time.\nAnd Columbus didn't even have the lame excuses of a Thomas Jefferson, like \"I grew up with it,\" or \"I couldn't afford not to do it.\""}
