A second man was taken to the hospital with non-life threatening injuries.\n\nJohn Edgerton, who lives near Lyon Park, said he heard multiple gunshots.\n\n\"I heard what sounded like a bunch of firecrackers,\" he said. \"I counted at least six, but there could have been more. It happened really, really quickly.\"\n\nDespite the shooting, Edgerton said his neighborhood is a safe one.\n\n\"The neighborhood has been very good and very safe,\" he said. \"We have not had problems, but we do hear gunshots occasionally at night.\"\n\nEdgerton said when he arrived at the shooting scene he saw police focusing a lot of activity by a car with its doors open. He said it also looked like officers were searching for something inside the park.\n\nNo charges have been filed.\n\nAnyone with information is asked to call Durham Crime Stoppers at 919-683-1200.
