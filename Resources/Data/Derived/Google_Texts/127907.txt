The city of Denver on Monday said it signed on to a court brief by dozens of cities and counties in support of President Barack Obama’s immigration executive action.

A federal judge in February issued a preliminary injunction barring the government from carrying out immediate provisions of Obama’s executive action. Ultimately, the administration says his action could spare up to 5 million people from deportation for living in the United States illegally. The judge’s ruling came in a case brought by Texas and 25 other states that challenges Obama’s move as unconstitutional.

The Justice Department is preparing to argue for the court to lift its hold during a hearing April 17. Mayor Michael Hancock decided that Denver, a member of Cities United for Immigration Action, would join a friend-of-the-court brief in support of that argument.

It has been signed by 71 cities and counties as well as the National League of Cities and the U.S. Conference of Mayors.

While Texas and the other plaintiff states argue they could suffer economic harm if the court allows Obama’s executive action to take effect, the mayors of Denver and the other cities, including New York City, Chicago and Los Angeles, say they would benefit from the reforms.

The changes approved by Obama “will benefit cities and counties by providing work authorization to millions, increasing local tax revenue, stimulating local economies, facilitating the civic engagement of immigrants, keeping families together, and improving public safety by strengthening our neighborhoods and communities,” says a news release issued by the Denver mayor’s office and the other cities Monday.

“I add my voice to the chorus of mayors in cities large and small who say the safety, health and well-being of our economies and our neighborhoods require that hundreds of thousands of families be allowed to emerge from the shadows and help us build stronger communities,” Hancock said in the release.
