One man says that the foster care system is broken and some of the foster parents are only in the program for the money.

Gaberial McDonald says he was put in the system in the early 2000s and was abused.

McDonald says he was raped 17 times, beaten and starved. He claims that one of the men that raped him is now in jail on aggravated indecent liberties charges.

McDonald says he and his three siblings were taken out of their home after their mother could no longer afford utilities and the home had no electricity or water.

He thinks that many other children are place in homes that are worse than the home they were taken out of.

"They are just throwing us out there, taking us out of bad situations and putting us in worse," he said.

Executive Director of the Sedgwick County Court Appointed Special Advocate Program Ashley Thorne says that there are situations where the foster home is not a healthy environment.

"Sometimes the system itself will abuse the child and it may not be physical abuse where they actually have hands on the child, but simple things like not getting their medical needs met in a timely manner," Thorne said.

She says that there are around 1,200 children in foster care inside Sedgwick County and the CASA organization only has the staff to serve 150 children. Thorne wants people to volunteer their time because their organization gets results.

"If the CASA says this home environment is not healthy or they are being abused, the judge will remove that child on the spot in the courtroom," she said.

The Kansas Department of Health and Environment confirms that it used to take care of the training for foster parents, but as of July 1, 2015, that responsibility was handed over to the Department of Children and Families.

KAKE News made multiple requests to speak with the Department of Children and Families. It has not responded.
