Terry McAuliffe\u2019s deserted office suite one recent Sunday, on a mission from Republican House Speaker William J. Howell.\n\nWatergate it was not. The workers were escorted by the chief of Capitol Police. Their assignment: to drop off a copy of the state budget bill.\n\nYet the expedition was not entirely devoid of political intrigue. The sooner the budget arrived at the governor\u2019s office, the sooner McAuliffe (D) would have to act on it; the governor gets seven days from the moment it lands, to sign, veto or amend it.\n\nSo the delivery Howell engineered packed a bit of political punch by forcing the governor to hustle. The governor\u2019s office accused Howell and Capitol police of a breach of security.\n\nIt has come to this in a Capitol where civility and decorum were once high arts: It is not enough to fight over the state budget. The manner by which budget documents physically change hands is layered with scheming, suspicion and acrimony. The episode came to light this week as the legislature finally came together on a long-delayed state spending plan. Despite the budget detente, intense partisanship and distrust hang over Richmond as the fight over Medicaid expansion churns on.\n\nMcAuliffe is pushing ahead with plans to defy the GOP-led General Assembly and expand the health-care program for the poor under the Affordable Care Act. Republicans are determined to block him.\n\nOn Wednesday, the fight escalated again: House Republicans announced that one of the nation\u2019s most prominent lawyers had found that the governor lacked the authority to expand the program unilaterally. Former U.S. solicitor general Paul D. Clement said on a conference call with reporters that McAuliffe does not have that power in a state where all spending, even pass-through money from Washington, must be appropriated by the General Assembly. The House paid Clement a flat fee of $25,000 for his opinion.\n\nAlso Wednesday, Sen. Charles J. Colgan (D-Prince William), announced that he would not seek reelection next year. The move was not unexpected. Colgan, an 87-year-old World War II veteran first elected in 1975, had wanted to retire in 2011, but fellow Democrats coaxed him into running one last time in swing territory that now-former governor Robert F. McDonnell (R) won in 2009, but McAuliffe picked up last year.\n\nBut Colgan\u2019s announcement, first reported by the Prince William Times, gave Republicans hope that they could pick up one more seat in the Senate. The GOP has controlled the chamber by a one-seat margin since Democrat Phillip P. Puckett\u2019s surprise resignation earlier this month. The FBI is investigating the circumstances of Puckett\u2019s departure.\n\nThe flap over how the budget was delivered, first reported by the Richmond Times-Dispatch, emerged less than 24 hours after the legislature finalized the budget.\n\nOn June 12, a Thursday, the House and Senate approved the budget and the House clerk\u2019s office began preparing the document for delivery to the governor \u2014 a process that can take several days. State government could have shut down and the state could have lost its stellar bond rating if the new budget was not in place by the start of the fiscal year July 1, so House Appropriations Committee staff worked furiously to finish the job early. They were ready to hand the budget over by Sunday, June 15, which happened to be Father\u2019s Day.\n\nHouse Clerk G. Paul Nardo called the governor\u2019s legislative director, Felix Sarfo-Kantanka Jr. that morning to say his office was ready to drop the document off. But Sarfo-Kantanka was out of town celebrating the day with his father and said he could not accept it. He said no one else from the governor\u2019s office was available. He suggested that they bring it over on Monday. That would have given McAuliffe until the following Monday to act on the budget, instead of the following Sunday.\n\nHowell was eager to get the document to the governor\u2019s office given that the July 1 deadline was fast approaching, said Howell spokesman Matthew Moran. Nardo called Col. Anthony S. Pike, chief of Capitol Police, whose force is responsible for security at all Capitol Square buildings.\n\nPike got the call in the midst of his own Father\u2019s Day festivities. But he put that on hold to head for the Capitol, 20 minutes away.\n\n\u201cI came in to do what I considered my duty and my job to help get the budget moved along, took time away from my family,\u201d he said.\n\nHe escorted two House Clerk\u2019s Office staffers into the Patrick Henry Building, into the governor\u2019s third-floor offices and then into McAuliffe\u2019s private office suite \u2014 a trip that required him to swipe a security access card three times, according to the governor\u2019s office. They left the hefty budget bill on a chair outside of the governor\u2019s personal office, which Pike said they never entered.\n\n\u201cWhat occurred here Sunday is unacceptable,\u201d McAuliffe Chief of Staff Paul J. Reagan wrote in a June 18 letter to Pike. \u201cTwo employees of the Speaker of the House of Delegates were given access to an area of the Governor\u2019s office where sensitive files and materials are kept. For good reason, it is an area that is surrounded by three security perimeters.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cEven on a normal business day, very few people \u2014 including members of the Governor\u2019s cabinet \u2014 can gain access to this suite of offices. We certainly do not expect to have agents and employees of the General Assembly roaming through these offices on weekends.\u201d\n\nReagan\u2019s letter said that he had notified a separate law enforcement agency, Virginia State Police, of \u201cthis breach of security.\u201d Reagan did not ask for an investigation, and State Police spokeswoman Corinne Geller said there was none underway. But Pike said he was stung by the criticism.\n\n\u201cI think the part that alarmed me was the sentence that the state police have been notified of a breach of security, which [implies] that I did something unlawful,\u201d Pike said. \u201cThere was no sinister motive behind it. I had some of my employees come up to me today and say, \u2018Colonel, did you do something wrong?\u2019 It\u2019s bothersome.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Former U.S. solicitor general, hired as consultant, says governor must have legislature\u2019s approval.", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/laura.vozzella", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Former U.S. solicitor general, hired as consultant, says governor must have legislature\u2019s approval.", "title": "In Virginia, budget delivery spat reveals level of spite", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/va-house-republicans-tout-report-saying-medicaid-expansion-is-a-legislative-decision/2014/06/25/b8ede384-fc78-11e3-932c-0a55b81f48ce_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/03/06/Local-Enterprise/Images/Virginia_Legislature-03097.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@jennaportnoy"}, "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Medicaid, McAuliffe, Howell, Paul Clement, virginia, budget", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/laura.vozzella"}, "eomportal-uuid": "b8ede384-fc78-11e3-932c-0a55b81f48ce", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "Medicaid, McAuliffe, Howell, Paul Clement, virginia, budget"}, "article_summary": "Despite the budget detente, intense partisanship and distrust hang over Richmond as the fight over Medicaid expansion churns on.\nTheir assignment: to drop off a copy of the state budget bill.\nIt has come to this in a Capitol where civility and decorum were once high arts: It is not enough to fight over the state budget.\nHowell was eager to get the document to the governor\u2019s office given that the July 1 deadline was fast approaching, said Howell spokesman Matthew Moran.\nHe said no one else from the governor\u2019s office was available."}
