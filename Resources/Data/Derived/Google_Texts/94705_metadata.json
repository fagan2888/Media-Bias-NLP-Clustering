In his speech, Coburn reflected on his time as a congressman, explained his worldview, gave advice to colleagues and gave thanks to those that helped and supported him.\n\nCoburn, a three term Representative, was elected to the Senate in 2004 and then re-elected in 2010. However, at the beginning of 2014, he announced he would be retiring at the end of the year. His farewell address on Thursday would be his last speech on the Senate floor.\n\nThe speech started off with a sentimental thank you list to many of his staff members. Occasionally unable to hold back his emotion, Coburn thanked his staff members and his chief of staff saying, \u201cWe\u2019re only able to function because of all the people who enable us to do it.\u201d\n\nHe then began to reflect on his time in Congress. \u201cTo those of you, through the years, who I have offended,\u201d Corburn said, \u201cI truly apologize.\u201d He mentioned that no offense was intended; it was merely the result of his worldview that placed liberty and the constitution above all else.\n\n\u201cI believe our founders were absolutely brilliant. Far smarter than us,\u201d Coburn explained. He said we would not begin to solve our country\u2019s problems until we once again accept the instruction of the constitution and restore individual liberty to everyone. \u201cBut I don\u2019t believe we can if we continue to ignore the wisdom of our founding documents,\u201d said Coburn.\n\nToday, the state of the country is in bad shape, according to Coburn. He said the struggling economy and loss of freedom has created a country that his father would not recognize. Corburn attributes these problems to a centralized government that is too involved in decision-making instead of leaving it to the power of the free market.\n\nHe stops short of blaming his colleagues of opposition though when he said their intentions were not bad. \u201cThe intentions are great. The motivations of the people in this body are wonderful. But the perspective of how we do it, and what the long-term consequences of how we do it really do matter,\u201d said Coburn. These intentions don\u2019t prevent unintended consequences, however.\n\nTo prevent the occurrence of these unintended consequences, Coburn stands by specific principles. When reading legislation, Coburn determines if it may negatively impact life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. He then makes sure the bill is consistent with the oath congressmen take when sworn into office.\n\nWhile giving words of advice to his colleagues, the Senator took the time to read the oath in full. \u201cYour state is not mentioned one time in that oath,\u201d Coburn said to his fellow Senators. He told them their goal was to defend liberty and the constitution, not to pursue benefits for your individual state.\n\nAt the closing of his speech, Coburn began giving thanks again. He thanked his family for their sacrifice and he thanked his staff. He then gave thanks to his fellow Senators, who he said were \u201cworking for a better country for us all.\u201d The Senator then yielded the floor to a standing ovation.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://blog.heartland.org/2014/12/senator-coburns-farewell-address/", "site_name": "Somewhat Reasonable", "image": "http://blog.heartland.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/coburn.jpg", "type": "activity", "title": "Senator Coburn\u2019s Farewell Address"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf8cd\"", "article_summary": "On December 11th 2014, Senator Tom Coburn gave an emotional farewell address on the Senate floor.\nHis farewell address on Thursday would be his last speech on the Senate floor.\n\u201cYour state is not mentioned one time in that oath,\u201d Coburn said to his fellow Senators.\nIn his speech, Coburn reflected on his time as a congressman, explained his worldview, gave advice to colleagues and gave thanks to those that helped and supported him.\nHe then gave thanks to his fellow Senators, who he said were \u201cworking for a better country for us all.\u201d The Senator then yielded the floor to a standing ovation."}
