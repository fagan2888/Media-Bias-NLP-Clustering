His Holiness may be the only hope.\n\nThis, of course, is where the analogy crumbles.\n\nFor this particular Congress to cooperate and do something new would require a miracle on the order of loaves and fishes \u2014 perhaps Pope Francis can do something about that when he\u2019s on the Hill next week. His Holiness may be the only hope.\n\nWhat\u2019s happening is just the latest virulent iteration of the strategy with which the Republicans have infected Congress from the night Barack Obama became president. Make governing impossible (as the old P.J. O\u2019Rourke saying goes, \u201cThe Republicans are the party that says government doesn\u2019t work and then they get elected and prove it\u201d). Shut down democracy, if that\u2019s what it takes. Keep from happening anything that helps and protects the 99 percent or threatens the plutocracy.\n\nNo wonder J. David Cox, union president of the American Federation of Government Employees, told the publication Government Executive, \u201cI\u2019d like for them to stay out of town for the rest of the year. That would make my life more complete.\u201d\n\nThe House and Senate sprinted off to vacation a few weeks ago with much undone, and thus have returned to a series of difficult deadlines that need to be addressed before the end of the month. Once they\u2019ve put the Iran nuclear deal to bed, kicking and screaming all the way, there are a dozen spending bills that require resolution. But because of right wing GOP threats insisting on tying the defunding of Planned Parenthood to these appropriations measures, there\u2019s the real possibility \u2013 some say as high as 70 percent \u2014 of deadlock and yet another government shutdown. With that would come the delights of forced federal furloughs, delayed paychecks, closed national parks and monuments and all the other attendant joys with which we became too familiar just a couple of years ago.\n\nThe probable outcome of all this sturm und drang is passage of a yet another continuing resolution (CR) that would keep government running at its current funding levels until a solution is hammered out. Mike DeBonis and Kelsey Snell reported in The Washington Post, \u201cCongressional Democrats \u2026 [have] already named a price for backing a short-term funding extension: no unrelated policy riders or attempts to undo Obama policy initiatives in the stopgap measure, with long-term negotiations over increases in domestic spending to follow.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "After all the damage the last government shutdown wrought, our elected officials are gearing up for a sequel VIDEO", "title": "Congress is a confederacy of dunces \u2014 and its Republicans should be made to sit in the corner", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "After all the damage the last government shutdown wrought, our elected officials are gearing up for a sequel VIDEO", "title": "Congress is a confederacy of dunces \u2014 and its Republicans should be made to sit in the corner", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/09/20/a_confederacy_of_dunces_expect_more_of_the_same_from_congress_this_fall_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/mcconnell_boehner_capitol.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "After all the damage the last government shutdown wrought, our elected officials are gearing up for a sequel VIDEO", "title": "Congress is a confederacy of dunces \u2014 and its Republicans should be made to sit in the corner", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/mcconnell_boehner_capitol.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Michael Winship", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, BillMoyers.com, Congress, Government shutdown, John Boehner, Mitch McConnell", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: BillMoyers.com, Congress, Government shutdown, John Boehner, Mitch McConnell, Politics NewsThis piece originally appeared on BillMoyers.com.\nOnce they\u2019ve put the Iran nuclear deal to bed, kicking and screaming all the way, there are a dozen spending bills that require resolution.\nWhat\u2019s happening is just the latest virulent iteration of the strategy with which the Republicans have infected Congress from the night Barack Obama became president.\nO\u2019Rourke saying goes, \u201cThe Republicans are the party that says government doesn\u2019t work and then they get elected and prove it\u201d).\nKeep from happening anything that helps and protects the 99 percent or threatens the plutocracy."}
