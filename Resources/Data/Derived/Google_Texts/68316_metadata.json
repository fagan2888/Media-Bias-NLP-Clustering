Harry Reid blasted Boehner\u2019s suit as something not even worthy of her time.\n\n\u201cThis is a phony trial that will come up. It\u2019s a show trial. It\u2019s what Republicans want. I guess that\u2019s what they want, but if that\u2019s really what they want, they should go talk to Judge Judy,\u201d he said Monday on the Senate floor.\n\n\u201cI think she would throw this case out in a half a second. The United States Congress is no place for inane, politically motivated litigation. I think Judge Judy would agree.\u201d\n\nBut she won't say if she does agree.\n\nWho me? Judge Judy won\u2019t comment on Sen. Reid\u2019s claim that the TV judge would throw out House Speaker Boehner\u2019s lawsuit against Obama. (CBS)\n\nBoehner (R-Ohio) has said he will sue the President, challenging Obama\u2019s executive action in delaying the employer mandate in the Affordable Care Act.\n\nReid dragged the TV judge into the debate, even though it\u2019s not clear where she falls on the political spectrum.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t flaunt her political stripes and there is no record of political contributions under her name, Judge Judith Sheindlin.\n\nThe tough-as-nails judge did admit in 2013 that she has been let down after having \u201chigh hopes\u201d when Obama was elected.\n\nSome love from the bench. Obama looked cozy with Judith Sheindlin, host of 'Judge Judy,' at a gala dinner in Los Angeles in May. (BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP/Getty Images)\n\n\u201cThings of late haven\u2019t been going so well\u201d, she said in a Larry King interview, complaining of \u201cmediocre politicians \u2026 people I wouldn\u2019t let do mundane things in my house. Somehow they get elected to higher office.\u201d\n\nBut this May she was spotted getting friendly with Obama at a USC Shoah Foundation dinner in Los Angeles\n\n\u201cWho doesn\u2019t love \u2018Judge Judy\u2019?\u201d the President said about the infamous lady of the bench at the fundraising gala, according to The New York Times.\n\nThe White House previously expressed it was \u201cdisappointing\u201d that Boehner was proceeding with plans to file suit, calling it a \u201cwaste time and taxpayer dollars on a political stunt.\u201d\n\n\u201cRepublican leaders in Congress are playing Washington politics rather than working with the President on behalf of hardworking Americans. As the President said today, he is doing his job \u2014 lawsuit or not \u2014 and it\u2019s time Republicans in Congress did theirs.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "LESLIE LARSON", "twitter": {"description": "Judge Judy won\u2019t rule on House Speaker John Boehner\u2019s lawsuit against President Obama.", "title": "Judge Judy won\u2019t rule on Boehner\u2019s lawsuit against Obama", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/judge-judy-won-rule-boehner-lawsuit-obama-article-1.1867433", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1867431.1405440457!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/judy16n-2-web.jpg", "site": "@nydailynews", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-author": "Leslie Larson", "parsely-type": "article", "sailthru.credits": "NEW YORK DAILY NEWS", "nydn_tags": "john boehner, obamacare, judge judy, barack obama", "parsely-pub-date": "2014-07-15T16:13:30", "parsely-link": "http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/judge-judy-won-rule-boehner-lawsuit-obama-article-1.1867433", "parsely-title": "Judge Judy won\u2019t rule on Boehner\u2019s lawsuit against Obama", "sailthru.date": "2014-07-15T12:13:30-0400", "sailthru.title": "Judge Judy won\u2019t rule on Boehner\u2019s lawsuit against Obama", "nydn_section": "Politics", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1867431.1405440457!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/judy16n-2-web.jpg", "description": "Judge Judy won\u2019t rule on House Speaker John Boehner\u2019s lawsuit against President Obama.", "robots": "NOARCHIVE", "fb": {"admins": 1594068001, "app_id": 107464888913, "pages": 268914272540}, "msvalidate.01": "02916AAC0DA8B068EFE01D721E03ED7E", "parsely-section": "Politics", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NYDailyNews/"}, "sailthru.description": "Judge Judy won\u2019t rule on House Speaker John Boehner\u2019s lawsuit against President Obama.", "viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"site_name": "NY Daily News", "description": "Judge Judy won\u2019t rule on House Speaker John Boehner\u2019s lawsuit against President Obama.", "title": "Judge Judy won\u2019t rule on Boehner\u2019s lawsuit against Obama", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/judge-judy-won-rule-boehner-lawsuit-obama-article-1.1867433", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1867431.1405440457!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/judy16n-2-web.jpg", "type": "article"}, "parsely-tags": "john boehner, obamacare, judge judy, barack obama", "p": {"domain_verify": "78efe4f5c9935744af497772f68a0ee7"}, "nydn_byline": "LESLIE LARSON", "parsely-image-url": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1867431.1405440457!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/judy16n-2-web.jpg"}, "article_summary": "Judge Judy won\u2019t comment on Sen.
