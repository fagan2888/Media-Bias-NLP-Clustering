The company rolled out a smaller and less stunning model in Atlanta in 2013, and it plans to expand the concept to other cities, according to a report in The Tennessean.\n\nCustomers who have selected a vehicle online to test-drive or purchase place an oversized coin into the machine. It begins to spin before grabbing the car and delivering it to the consumer.\n\nWhile it may sound gimmicky, the online process cuts down on labor and real estate costs at the dealership, saving car buyers more than $1,500 per vehicle, Carvana co-founder Ryan Keeton told The Tennessean. Customers also have the option of having the car delivered to them.\n\nRelated: Car Sales Are on Pace to Do Something They Haven\u2019t Done in 50 Years\n\n\u201cI think what we\u2019re trying to create is a fun way to pick up your car that is also metaphorically representative of what we are as a brand,\u201d he told the paper. \u201cIt\u2019s fun, it\u2019s easy, it\u2019s automated, and the customer is in control.\u201d\n\nCarvana has promised $200 to out-of-town customers for airfare and transportation to and from the vending machine.\n\nWhile the vending machine may be grabbing headlines, Carvana\u2019s primary business model allows customers to quickly and easily purchase used vehicles online.
