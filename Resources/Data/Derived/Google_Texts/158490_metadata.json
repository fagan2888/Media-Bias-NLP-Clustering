Mike Huckabee\u2019s (R-Ark.) remarks about women, then they should give equal time to comedian Sarah Silverman\u2019s vaginal napkin stunt, according to Red Alert Politics editor Francesca Chambers.\n\nFrancesca appeared on Fox\u2019s Huckabee on Saturday, along with two other Millennial panelists, Kayleigh McEnany and Shaaya Ellis. Huckabee asked the young people to weigh in on his comments about Democrats trying to make women dependent on the government \u2014 comments that sparked a media firestorm. Francesca argued that the media shouldn\u2019t play favorites.\n\n\u201cWhen Sarah Silverman gets up and does a live telethon for abortion \u2014 she gets up there and she raffles off a vagina napkin, it barely makes a blip in the national media,\u201d Francesca said. \u201cBut you get up there and say the word \u2018libido\u2019 and all of a sudden, it\u2019s a national story. So I\u2019m continually frustrated by the hypocrisy of the media.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to income inequality, Francesca argued on behalf of education reforms, such as school choice and making colleges more affordable. She also pushed for transparency measures that would allow students to know more about their degrees before they choose them.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to go to a university, you should be able to see how many other people in that field got jobs, the percentages \u2014 how many in that field overall and how many people at your university were able to get jobs,\u201d she said.\n\nWatch Francesca\u2019s appearance below:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "If media outlets are going to make a big deal out of former Gov.
