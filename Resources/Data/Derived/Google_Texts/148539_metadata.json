The ads were developed through a partnership with Get Covered Illinois.\n\nIn a push to enroll more \u201cyoung invincibles,\u201d the state\u2019s official Affordable Care Act outreach vehicle, Get Covered Illinois, has forged a partnership with satircal news site The Onion to run a series of advertisements and marketing material online.\n\nUnder terms of the agreement, the state will pay Chicago-based Onion Inc. $150,000 for $300,000 worth of online banner ads, a video, an editorial and a custom news section that will feature Get Covered Illinois, said Mike Claffey, a Get Covered Illinois spokesman.\n\nThe Onion, via its creative agency Onion Labs, will develop and feature the content through March 31, the deadline to enroll in the new health plans offered on online marketplaces created by the law known as Obamacare.\n\nThe success of the marketplaces, a key pillar of the law, depends largely on whether enough young, healthy people sign up for coverage to help offset the cost of older, sicker customers.\n\nReaching and engaging younger consumers is particularly important in Illinois, where they comprise some 53 percent of the uninsured, according to state data.\n\nIllinois\u2019 decision to tap the satirical humorists at The Onion was a savvy move by the state, said Kelly Leonard, executive vice president at The Second City, the Chicago satire factory that also has a division that works with corporate clients on marketing and messaging.\n\n\u201cHumor is the great equalizer. It\u2019s a great way to deal with difficult and taboo subjects,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cI think it\u2019s brave and potentially will be quite effective. Funny works.\u201d\n\nThe Onion, which made its name as a hard-copy newspaper that skewered just about everything, printed its last newspapers in December, transforming into an all-digital media company.
