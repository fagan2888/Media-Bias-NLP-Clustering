CLEARWATER — A 52-year-old woman faces a slew of charges, including one for attempted murder, after she sprayed her estranged husband in the face with hair spray, and attacked him with a hammer, knives and a screwdriver, the Pinellas County Sheriff’s Office said.

Investigators said Madeline A. Cadigan-Lettre and Joseph Allen Lettre, 53, both of 2661 Feather Sound Dr., who are getting divorced, began arguing around 10 p.m. Saturday, when Joseph Lettre returned to the home and asked to be let into his bedroom.

That’s when Madeline Cadigan-Lettre came out of the bedroom with hair spray, a sheriff’s report said.

She sprayed Joseph Lettre in the face before using “an electronic control device” on him and attacking him with a hammer, the report said.

Joseph Lettre retreated down a hall, but his wife chased him and tackled him in the living room, where she stabbed and cut him with knives and a screwdriver, the report said.

Neighbors heard the fight and called 911. When deputies arrived, the couple was still struggling, the report said.

Both were taken to a local hospital for treatment of non-life threatening injuries, the report said.

Madeline Cadigan-Lettre was being held in the Pinellas County Jail on Sunday, records show. She is charged with one count of attempted murder and six counts related to domestic battery and aggravated battery with physical disfigurement, records show. A bond amount was not immediately available.

The sheriff’s office was investigating Sunday.
