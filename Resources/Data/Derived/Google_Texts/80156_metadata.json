No ordinary trio, the travelers are a pair of drag performers and a recently widowed transsexual on their way to a gig at a resort in Alice Springs. In their trek across Australia, they learn a lot about life and love.\n\nThe show features a hit parade of songs heavy on such disco-drag classics as \u201cIt\u2019s Raining Men\u201d and a bounty of colorful costumes to sashay in while dancing to them.\n\nTim Chappel and Lizzy Gardinerearned an Academy Award for the movie costumes and a Tony for the Broadway show, and for good reason. From the iconic flip-flop dress to the swirling cupcake outfits complete with candle headdresses, the show is a visual riot.\n\nAnd quite the challenge for the actors and crew, as we learned during a backstage tour earlier this week.\n\nBryan West, who plays Adam (his drag name is Felicia) said he needs the help of five people to get into the skintight outfit he wears for his \u201cSempre Libera\u201d operatic performance in a giant platform shoe atop the bus.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s more choreography behind the scenes at times than on stage,\u201d West said.\n\nThe show\u2019s outrageous footwear \u2014 swim flippers with heels, platform sneaker-socks that go with cheerleader outfits, marabu feather-topped boots \u2014 are among West\u2019s favorite costume pieces. (He was also happy to discover what women have long known \u2014 heels make your legs look longer!)\n\nBut like all great divas, West as Felicia has suffered for his wardrobe indulgences. \u201cSequins will cut you,\u201d he said knowingly. \u201cAnd it hurts when your skin gets caught in a zipper.\u201d\n\nSpeaking of zippers, Scott Willis, who plays transgender Bernadette, broke one earlier in the tour while wearing one of his favorite \u201cPriscilla\u201d costumes, the floral blue chiffon number with a six-layered skirt.\n\n\u201cThere wasn\u2019t time to even stitch it back together before I had to go on,\u201d said Willis. He was careful not to expose his back to the audience, and the next zipper that was installed was thick and sturdy.\n\nLike many of the costumes, the blue dress was originally worn in the Broadway show and is lovingly cared for and repaired when needed on the road. \u201cThere\u2019s no more of the fabric available, so we have to make it last,\u201d Willis said.\n\nGillian Austin, the wardrobe supervisor who travels with the show, said a crew of 15 attends to the costumes for each performance. A dozen people are hired locally to assist with the production, and additional artists work on wigs and makeup.\n\nWith all the singing, dancing, set changes and about 20 costume changes for the three principal actors and numerous ones for the other performers during the show, the pace is demanding, Austin said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like being shot out of a cannon,\u201d West said.\n\nTall canisters of oxygen stand at the ready backstage when performers need it, but the lead actors say it\u2019s not the altitude making them short of breath during shows.\n\nIt\u2019s the corsets.\n\nYes, like women of yore, the three male leads all wear torso-trimming corsets at various points in the show to give them svelte figures.\n\nAs West admitted, \u201cAt times, I\u2019m fighting for breath to squeeze out those notes.\u201d\n\nSuzanne S.
