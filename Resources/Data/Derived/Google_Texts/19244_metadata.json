It was completely a surprise to me and many others,\u201d said Brahm Verma, a retired faculty member of UGA\u2019s College of Engineering and president of the UGA Retirees Association.\n\nThe change, scheduled to go into effect Jan. 1, 2016, is the second part of a two-phase plan designed to slow down the climbing cost of retiree health care.\n\nThe first part, now completed, required employees eligible for Medicare to move to a federal health insurance program.\n\nIn this second change, retirees will no longer be able to get co-insurance - insurance that helps pay for expenses not paid by Medicare - through the university system.\n\nInstead, retirees will be given a set amount of money that they can use to buy co-insurance through a so-called health insurance exchange - an organization that\u2019s supposed to help people choose health insurance policies.\n\nThe exchange the university system plans to use is not the same as the exchanges set up by the federal Affordable Health Care Act, but a private one set up about a decade ago, said Marion Fedrick, the university system\u2019s vice chancellor for human resources. Some universities, including private Emory University and Duke University, have already moved to the health insurance exchange model, she said.\n\nRetirees won\u2019t lose coverage and could even get comparable coverage at lower cost, Fedrick said in a memo circulated to senior university system administrators and again last week via telephone.\n\n\u201cWith the health care exchange option, the retiree will be able to choose best-in-market plans (and) maximize the value of each dollar spent on health care premiums since the retiree will be able to choose coverage specific to their needs,\u201d according to Fedrick\u2019s memo.\n\nThe University System of Georgia is self-insured, paying medical bills with money allocated by the state and money paid by employees for health insurance, though the system contracts with an insurance company to administer it. The state picks up between 70 and 75 percent of the cost, while employees must come up with the rest, he said.\n\nEven though the move will mean less expense for the university system, retirees should benefit from having more choices in the kinds and levels of coverage they get, Fedrick said.\n\nAnd because risk will be spread among millions of customers rather than just among the university system\u2019s roughly 16,000 retirees, retiree costs in the private plans should increase at a slower rate than they are now \u2014 a larger risk pool spreads risk and also spreads the costs out more, she said.\n\n\u201cRetirees are not losing benefits,\u201d Fedrick said. \u201cWe think the majority will get better plans.\u201d\n\nBut the memo and an accompanying \u201cFrequently Asked Questions\u201d document leave some important questions unanswered, Verma said. University System officials haven\u2019t determined how much money they will put into the \u201cdefined contribution health care accounts\u201d that they\u2019ll establish for retirees. And the state also hasn\u2019t determined whether the state\u2019s contribution will be fixed or increase over time along with the cost of health insurance premiums.\n\n\u201cWe are still trying to figure these things out,\u201d Verma said. \u201cI think the mystery problem is causing greater anxiety that what (the plan) might be.\u201d\n\nRetirees should have been involved in discussions about changing their health insurance options, Verma said.\n\n\u201cThere should have been more of a discussion about this,\u201d he said. \u201cI guess if nothing else, it could have been handled better. If it was approved in 2013, there were plenty of opportunities to bring it to retirees\u2019 attention.\u201d\n\nThe plan is to get the word out beginning this month, including meeting with retirees at UGA and other public colleges and universities across the state, Fedrick said.\n\nFollow education reporter Lee Shearer at www.facebook.com/LeeShearerABH or https://twitter.com/LeeShearer.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Athens News, Athens Georgia, Athens Banner Herald, Athens, Georgia, Georgia Bulldogs, Dawgs, Bulldogs, Music, UGA, newspaper, 30601, Clarke County, Madison, Oconee, Oglethorpe, Dogs, 30602, 30603, 30604, 30605, Richt, SEC football, Jackson County, R.E.M., Widespread Panic, B-52s, Local News, Lee Shearer", "og": {"site_name": "Online Athens", "description": "A plan to move University System of Georgia retirees from a health insurance plan run by the university system to private coverage insurance companies could actually save money for retirees, but some of those retirees are not so sure.", "title": "University System changes in health insurance worries retirees", "url": "http://onlineathens.com/uga/2015-02-28/university-system-changes-health-insurance-worries-retirees", "image": "http://onlineathens.com/sites/default/files/north_campus_trees_0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "OnlineAthens.com is the daily online edition of The Athens (GA) Banner-Herald."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd32e2\"", "article_summary": "A plan to move University System of Georgia retirees from a health insurance plan run by the university system to private coverage insurance companies could actually save money for retirees, but some of those retirees are not so sure.\nSome universities, including private Emory University and Duke University, have already moved to the health insurance exchange model, she said.\nThe first part, now completed, required employees eligible for Medicare to move to a federal health insurance program.\nThe University System of Georgia is self-insured, paying medical bills with money allocated by the state and money paid by employees for health insurance, though the system contracts with an insurance company to administer it.\nInstead, retirees will be given a set amount of money that they can use to buy co-insurance through a so-called health insurance exchange - an organization that\u2019s supposed to help people choose health insurance policies."}
