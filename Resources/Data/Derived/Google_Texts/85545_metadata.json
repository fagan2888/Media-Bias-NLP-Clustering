At Life News, Rachel Cox summarizes:\n\nIn November, Erick Munoz\u2019s wife Marlise, who was 14 weeks pregnant, suffered a blood clot and is still in the hospital hooked up to machines. Doctors say she is brain dead and will never recover. Erick Munoz believes the baby will have defects and the baby\u2019s life won\u2019t be worth living. Her husband says his wife clearly stated she never wanted to be on life support. Erick Munoz wants to \u201chonor his wife\u2019s wishes\u201d and remove her from life support which would kill her and their unborn baby. However, Texas law prevents the removal of a pregnant woman from life support and Erick Munoz is publicly voicing his opposition.\n\nDoctors plan to assess the baby\u2019s viability and decide whether to attempt a cesarean section at 24 weeks.\n\nAs Newsbusters\u2019 Katie Yoder documents, pro-aborts far and wide are seething with rage over this. But curiously, that\u2019s despite the fact that almost none of their token justifications are present. Delivery will no longer affect Marlise\u2019s well-being, and as Cox points out, whatever end-of-life wishes she had told Erick almost certainly didn\u2019t account for the remote possibility that ending her life would also end her son or daughter\u2019s, in what is presumably a desired pregnancy.\n\nThat means a man is presuming to make a woman\u2019s reproductive decision for her\u2014with the full backing of the supposed \u201creproductive rights\u201d champions. Apparently the outcome of a dead baby is all that matters.\n\nAt RH Reality Check, Katherine Taylor and Lynn Paltrow tie themselves into logic pretzels to argue that the case is \u201cdehumanizing\u201d:\n\nRather than archaic sexist laws left on the books from earlier times, the pregnancy exclusions are of a recent vintage. They establish that while men are free to determine what will happen to them if they become sick and unable to communicate their health-care wishes, women who may become pregnant are not free to plan the course of their health care, lives, and deaths.\n\n*Sigh* for the millionth time, the sexes aren\u2019t unequal; the situations are. Women are perfectly \u201cfree to determine what will happen to them if they become sick and unable to communicate their health-care wishes\u201d in all cases except those where making that determination would kill someone else.\n\nFor that reason, pregnancy is fundamentally incomparable to a non-pregnant person\u2019s wishes to have his or her own feeding tube removed. (And in reality, the principle behind pregnancy exclusion laws very well could apply to men\u2014for instance, whether one conjoined twin exercising his rights would infringe on the rights of his brother.)\n\nI\u2019m sorry guys can\u2019t get pregnant, but your quarrel is with biology, not some patriarchal boogeyman. The fact that liberals have devolved feminism into a perpetual temper tantrum about nature\u2019s unequal distribution of reproductive processes isn\u2019t a good enough reason to ignore the unborn life at stake.\n\nIt is hard to imagine a more absolute denial of a woman\u2019s personhood than depriving her of the right to decide her own future, and then literally using her body without permission\u2014possibly for weeks or months\u2014as an object for a fetus to grow in.\n\nOops. So desperate are the authors to hijack pro-life language for themselves that they\u2019ve unwittingly conceded the legitimacy of some of our own principles.\n\nWhether you consider Marlise Munoz dead probably depends on whether you believe her soul passed on with brain death or she\u2019s still in there until the rest dies, but the pro-aborts are clearly going by the former (or a secular equivalent), so let\u2019s run with it. She\u2019s dead; she has no more earthly consciousness, sentience, pain sensitivity, desires, welfare, or future. What she \u201cwould not have wanted\u201d can only possibly matter if she has or had some intrinsic worth completely unrelated to those qualities\u2014a sanctity of her life as a human being.\n\nCLICK LIKE IF YOU\u2019RE PRO-LIFE!\n\nIf that\u2019s the case, then an unborn baby, from his or her earliest moments of existence, must also warrant intrinsic respect regardless of those qualities. A zygote can\u2019t think, feel, or want, but he or she is a living human being with an entire future ahead. If anything, shouldn\u2019t a full life waiting to be had outweigh a life that is fully over?\n\nAnd clearly, these laws interfere with the practice of medicine, substituting legislators\u2019 values for what should be decisions made by pregnant patients and their families in consultation with physicians.\n\nSo I take it that means we should repeal ObamaCare, then? (Sorry. I know that\u2019s off-topic. But hey, low-hanging fruit.)\n\nWhen you think about it, it\u2019s only natural that pro-aborts accidentally make the pro-life case from time to time. There are no great morals to be protected or enlightenment to be learned by championing a cause of pure selfishness, so when looking for actual principles to wrap it in, there are only so many places to look.\n\nLifeNews.com Note: Calvin Freiburger is a Live Action contributing writer.
