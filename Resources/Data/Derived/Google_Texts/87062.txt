Story highlights Cruz has at times been careful to avoid criticizing candidates harshly by name

But Cruz is indicating a fresh willingness to go after Bush

Memphis, Tennessee (CNN) Ted Cruz offered rare and most likely tongue-in-cheek praise to his ideological rival, Jeb Bush, for his "candor" in not backing down from his more moderate positions on immigration and Common Core.

Cruz, who has looked to position himself as the furthest-right candidate in the field, said in an interview with CNN on Tuesday that he appreciated that Bush, who may be the GOP's furthest to the left, was not changing his positions.

"There are candidates in the field who attempt to change their position to do better in primaries, and Jeb Bush has demonstrated a remarkable candor defending positions," said Cruz, a Texas senator. "Jeb Bush has been straightforward and consistent and candid about his embrace of amnesty and Common Core, and I respect that he is willing to stand for those principles."

"He will continue to stand on his principles," she said.
