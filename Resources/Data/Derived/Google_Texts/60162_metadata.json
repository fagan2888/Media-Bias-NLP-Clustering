By late October, the full report should include conclusions that explain what\u2019s working well, or what barriers are causing a disparity if there is one. Superintendent Tom Boasberg told the board that preliminary information indicates there is a disparity.\n\nIf so, later this year DPS would put together a diversity council made up of community professionals that would evaluate availability of contractors for each project, and determine a realistic goal for how much participation each project should have from minority or women-owned businesses.\n\nBusinesses would need to be certified as minority or women owned to count toward the district\u2019s quota.\n\nBoard members emphasized the need for public input on the plans before they vote.\n\n\u201cI would like to encourage that we just not hold a public meeting and invite people to it, that we need to be more proactive, that we actually go to groups and schedule updates to their group,\u201d said board member Landri Taylor.\n\nIn the meantime, the district is moving forward on other non-race based plans to broaden their pool of contractors, including hosting a mixer, increasing partnerships and requiring letters of intent from contractors to approve subcontractors.\n\nBeginning as early as next month, DPS is also planning to set some smaller projects aside that would only be up for bid by small businesses. The projects would be under $750,000.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s large enough to where it would be of help to the small businesses, but not too large to where they wouldn\u2019t be capable of performing,\u201d Deane said. \u201cThis is just a start. We would be re-evaluating how it works.\u201d\n\nYesenia Robles: 303-954-1372, yrobles@denverpost.com or twitter.com/yeseniarobles", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Denver schools wait for study of contractor diversity, plan for quotas", "title": "Denver schools wait for study of contractor diversity, plan for quotas", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/09/15/denver-schools-wait-for-study-of-contractor-diversity-plan-for-quotas/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140915__20140607__denverschoolsp1p1-1.jpg", "height": 456}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140915__20140607__denverschoolsp1p1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-15T17:48:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T08:03:52+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Denver Public Schools"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcdb2\"", "article_summary": "Preparing for the results of a study looking at the diversity of Denver Public Schools\u2019 contractors , the district is drafting a plan to implement diversity quotas for every project if the study shows a biased disparity.\n\u201cWe try to ensure that when we\u2019re contracting, it kind of mirrors our community,\u201d said Trena Deane, executive director of facility management for DPS.\nBoard members emphasized the need for public input on the plans before they vote.\nIf the study shows the program needs to be implemented, DPS could be the only school district in Colorado, and only among a handful in the country that sets diversity participation requirements.\nBusinesses would need to be certified as minority or women owned to count toward the district\u2019s quota."}
