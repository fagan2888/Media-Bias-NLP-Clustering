Horse racing and wagering is now legal on Palm Sunday.

Among a number of bills either signed or vetoed by Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Saturday was a piece of legislation lifting the ban on those activities on the Sunday before Easter.

The justification memo for Assemblyman Gary Pretlow’s bill is rather straightforward: “The inclusion of Palm Sunday as a date that Board is authorized to allow horse racing or licensing race meetings at which pari-mutuel betting is permitted affords the public more recreational opportunities to enjoy the excitement and relaxation of horse racing.”

By law, racing and pari-mutual wagering remains prohibited on Christmas and Easter.

The full list of new laws and vetoed bills is below. Be warned, it’s lengthy.

Below that are the approval and veto messages that accompany some of the legislation.
