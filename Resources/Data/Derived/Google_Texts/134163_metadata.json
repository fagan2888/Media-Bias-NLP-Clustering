The 31st annual Boulder Polar Plunge was held at the Boulder Reservoir on New Year s Day, organized by connectBCAP as a fundraiser for the Boulder County AIDS Project. ( Cliff Grassmick )\n\n\n\n\u201cYou don't expect how cold it will be,\u201d said Charlie, of Boulder, as he shivered after today's dip. \u201cYour legs start to turn numb and then you trip on the water.\u201d\n\n\n\nStill, he added, he has every intention of continuing the tradition for many more years to come.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt's just fun,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nHundreds line up each year for the for the New Year's Day Polar Plunge. While in year's past organizers had to break through a layer if ice, this year the water wasn't quite freezing, with a temperature of 37 degrees. Emerging from the water, participants had to dash through the 39-degree cold to get to a heated tent to thaw out.\n\n\n\nThe Boulder County AIDS Project took over the event this year after the previous organizers, the Young Professionals Alzheimer's Association of Colorado, cut ties with the fundraiser. The young professionals' fundraising arm of the Boulder County AIDS Project \u2014 connectBCAP \u2014 headed up the fundraiser this year.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt's a really fun and crazy event,\u201d said Katie Johnstone, co-chair of connectBCAP. \u201cWe had a lot of teams. It's a really fun way for people to connect and come together.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe event was founded in 1983 by Norwegian Trygve Bauge, grandson of Bredo Morstoel, whose frozen remains are celebrated at Nederland's annual Frozen Dead Guy Days festival each March.\n\n\n\nGolden's Kim Taha said she's taken a freezing dip on New Year's for the past 10 years. Her reason \u2014 or excuse, as her family termed it \u2014 is that she's Norwegian. And, she acknowledged, \u201ca little bit crazy.

She also sports a troll wig every year.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt's exhilarating, is what it is,\u201d she said. \u201cI love it.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnother long timer is 17-year-old Calla Dilli of Littleton, who's also on her 10th year. She said she can't remember exactly why she started the tradition, but continued it because her grandmother had Alzheimer's and she liked the idea of the fundraiser. The Boulder County AIDS Project also seems like a good cause, she said.\n\n\n\nThis year, she and a friend went in twice. The first time, they didn't go under \u2014 though her friend did manage a backstroke. So they went in a second time to dunk their heads, a move they to debate for a bit before committing.\n\n\n\nWhile it wasn't as cold as last year, Calla said, \u201cit was still really cold.\u201d\n\n\n\nScott Thompson, his wife and daughter all took their inaugural plunge today.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt's for a good cause, and everyone's in a happy mood,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nLongmont's Abby Crisafulli, who talked two friends into coming with her \u2014 one who had it on her \u201cbucket list\u201d and one who said she succumbed to peer pressure \u2014 was on her third plunge.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt's an adrenaline rush,\u201d she said. \u201cIt's cold enough that it doesn't really matter how cold it is.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter a wild run and dunk in the chilly water of the Boulder Reservoir for the second year, 12-year-old Charlie Springer warned that even experience isn't enough to fully prepare for the numbing cold.\u201cYou don't expect how cold it will be,\u201d said Charlie, of Boulder, as he shivered after today's dip. \u201cYour legs start to turn numb and then you trip on the water.\u201dStill, he added, he has every intention of continuing the tradition for many more years to come.\u201cIt's just fun,\u201d he said.Hundreds line up each year for the for the New Year's Day Polar Plunge.
