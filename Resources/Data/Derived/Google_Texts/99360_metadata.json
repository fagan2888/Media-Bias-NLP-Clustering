History still beckons, waiting to be made. The great unstated question of today: Can America come back, reclaim her old spirit, confidence and joy, can we make things again, build them, grow, create, push out into the new?\n\nAnd here I think: Oh dear.\n\nBecause when I imagine Barack Obama's State of the Union, I see a handsome, dignified man standing at the podium and behind him Joe Biden, sleeping. And next to him John Boehner, snoring. And arrayed before the president the members, napping.\n\nNo one's really listening to the president now. He has been for five years a nonstop wind-up talk machine. Most of it has been facile, bland, the same rounded words and rounded sentiments, the same soft accusations and excuses. I see him enjoying the sound of his voice as the network newsman leans forward eagerly, intently, nodding at the pearls, enacting interest, for this is the president and he is the anchorman and surely something important is being said with two such important men engaged.\n\nBut nothing interesting was being said! Looking back on this presidency, it has from the beginning been a 17,000 word New Yorker piece in which, calmly, sonorously, with his lovely intelligent voice, the president says nothing, or little that is helpful, insightful or believable. \"I'm not a particularly ideological person.\" \"It's hard to anticipate events over the next three years.\" \"I don't really even need George Kennan right now.\" \"I am comfortable with complexity.\" \"Our capacity to do some good . . . is unsurpassed, even if nobody is paying attention.\"\n\nNobody is!\n\nHe gave a speech on the National Security Agency, that bitterly contested issue, the other day. Pew Research found half of those polled didn't notice. National Journal's Dustin Volz wrote that Americans greeted the speech with \"collective indifference and broad skepticism.\" Of the 1 in 10 who'd followed it, more than 70% doubted his proposals would help protect privacy.\n\nThe bigger problem is that the president stands up there Tuesday night with ObamaCare not a hazy promise but a fact. People now know it was badly thought, badly written and disastrously executed. It was supposed to make life better by expanding coverage. It has made it worse, by throwing people off coverage. And\u2014as we all know now but did not last year\u2014the program was passed only with the aid of a giant lie. Now everyone knows if you liked your plan, your doctor, your deductible, you can't keep them.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.modified": "01-24-14", "dc.type": "Text.Article", "twitter": {"image": "http://nation.foxnews.com/sites/nation.foxnews.com/files/styles/story_624_300/public/not-listening.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.publisher": "Fox News", "parsely-metadata": "{\"title\":\"NOONAN: No One's Listening to President Obama Anymore\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/nation.foxnews.com\\/2014\\/01\\/24\\/noonan-no-ones-listening-president-obama-anymore\",\"image_url\":\"http:\\/\\/nation.foxnews.com\\/sites\\/nation.foxnews.com\\/files\\/styles\\/story_624_300\\/public\\/not-listening.jpg\",\"section\":\"nation\",\"author\":\"Fox News\",\"tags\":[],\"type\":\"article\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-01-24T08:56:08-05:00\",\"identifier\":\"60857\"}", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "prism.channel": "fnc", "dc.description": "From Peggy Noonan&#039;s &#039;The Sleepiness of a Hollow Legend&#039; in the Wall Street Journal:Well.
