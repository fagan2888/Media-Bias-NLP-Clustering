Two weeks later, responding to growing public criticism about the idea of neighbors informing on neighbors on the proposed health care bill, the White House announced it had deactivated the \u201cflag\u201d email.\n\nDid they? Despite the administration\u2019s announcement that the \u201cflag\u201d had been deactivated and removed, we have found that today, more than four years later, the email address still appears on the White House webpages (http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/Facts-Are-Stubborn-Things), accompanied by the same invitation to citizens to report anyone who is disseminating misinformation about Obamacare.\n\nOn the Whitehouse.gov website, visitors are still encouraged to \u201chelp end the disinformation\u201d about health-insurance reform:\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of disinformation about health-insurance reform out there, spanning from control of personal finances to end-of-life care. These rumors often travel just below the surface via chain emails or through casual conversation.\n\n\u201cSince we can\u2019t keep track of all of them here at the White House, we\u2019re asking for your help. If you get an email or see something on the Web about health-insurance reform that seems fishy, send it to flag@whitehouse.gov.\u201d\n\nIt is reasonable to think that the White House, like many other organizations, simply forgot to remove the Web pages. This is unlikely because the Web page that showcases the \u201cflag\u201d email inviting informants to report on others was updated as recently as November 2013. At the top of the Web page is an update featuring a recent interview with President Obama.\n\nOn Aug. 19, 2009, The Washington Post indicated that emails to the canceled \u201cflag\u201d email address now refer people to the White House\u2019s \u201cReality Check\u201d site, where they can report distortions through an online interface.\n\nIt is likely that to quell public criticism, the White House may have created a pass-through system by which someone who wants to report \u201cmisinformation\u201d that \u201ctraveled just below the surface via chain emails or through casual conversation\u201d about Obamacare can still do so.\n\nThe invitation is still there, and the platform for soliciting and gathering information is still very much in place. Citizens are still being invited to inform on their friends and neighbors\u2019 email or conversations.\n\nThis is a problem. From the first day the \u201cflag\u201d email site was announced, its creation symbolically signaled that the Obama administration intended to do everything it could to promote its social policies and suppress all dissent. Some worried whether the creation of the site to inform on dissenters from the president\u2019s policies was just a ploy to gather information about potential political enemies.\n\nLawmakers knew this. Even when the site was reported to have been removed, Sen. John Cornyn, Texas Republican, noted that \u201cquestions still remain about information that\u2019s already been collected over the past few weeks.\u201d\n\nOne pundit asked why there was such little hue and outcry from individuals otherwise vexed by President George W. Bush\u2019s \u201cTIPS\u201d program, which invited citizens to inform the government about potential terrorist threats in the wake of Sept. 11, 2001, and not an effort to collect information about persons exercising their First Amendment rights in dissenting from Obamacare.\n\nIt is still possible to report fellow citizens. For those adventurous enough to test it \u2014 those who want to report on those still spreading erroneous information about the act \u2014 all one has to do is to go to the whitehouse.gov site, find the \u201cflag\u201d link to the White House, and inform away.\n\nAnne Hendershott is director of the Veritas Center for Ethics in Public Life at Franciscan University in Steubenville, Ohio.
