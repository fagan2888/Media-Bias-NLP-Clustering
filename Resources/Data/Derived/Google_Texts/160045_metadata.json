It could fit in your hand,\" he said, adding he's never seen anything happen like this.\n\nThe umbilical cord was still attached, and there appeared to be no signs of trauma, he said.\n\n\"You wonder what happened,\" Estrada said. \"Did somebody abort the fetus? Did they have a miscarriage? You wonder what the mother is going through.\"\n\nThe grisly discovery won't affect water quality, he said.\n\nMeanwhile, the medical examiner's office is working to determine where it came from, possibly using DNA, he said. Authorities are hoping someone will come forward who knows what happened.\n\n\"It's a tragic situation, whether it's a fetus that was aborted or a miscarriage,\" Estrada said.\n\nCopyright 2016 Tucson News Now.
