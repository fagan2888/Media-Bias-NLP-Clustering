Essentially, the proposal would consolidate a number of departments, boards, and commissions under a single Director of Planning & Development, who would be a mayoral appointee. It would place the Planning Commission, the Zoning Board of Adjustment, and the Historical Commission into a Division of Planning & Zoning. It would also create a Housing Division with an Intergovernmental Housing Commission to administer the Housing Trust Fund.\n\nThe proposal would create a Division of Licenses, Inspections & Enforcement that would be responsible for most of the functions of the current Dept. of Licenses & Inspections.\n\nClarke said that his proposal had been in the works for more than a year, and that it had nothing to do with the report of the special advisory commission on L&I.\n\nAlan Greenberger, the deputy mayor for economic development, commended the Council President for taking on such a sweeping reorganization of the government and said he agreed with a number of its goals. But he said the Nutter Administration and various groups who could be impacted had concerns and needed more time to consider the proposal.\n\nClarke said he will work with the Administration and various stakeholder groups over the next few months and plan to amend the bill and get the charter amendment placed on the spring ballot.\n\n\u201cI think that our ability to get this moving and get it on the charter referendum in May gives us an opportunity to actually have something implemented in mid-2016,\u201d Clarke said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t do that, then you\u2019re pushing it back, possibly, to 2017. At some point, everybody acknowledges that there should be some things done. But we need to tee it up to have the appropriate program in place.\u201d\n\nSTACK ANNOUNCES $1M GRANT FOR AUTISM CENTER\n\nState Sen. Mike Stack (D-Northeast) lauded the announcement of a $1 million state grant to support renovations at the Center of Autism in Northeast Philadelphia.\n\n\u201cThe Center for Autism performs valuable services for hundreds of children and is a leader in addressing this public health puzzle,\u201d Stack said. \u201cProgress in evaluating and treating autism will have an impact not only on affected families, but also on our schools and society as a whole.\u201d\n\nThe Center, which receives as many as 500 calls for new services each month, is planning to renovate its Philadelphia facility to provide services to hundreds more children with autism and their families. The renovation will cost an estimated $3.2 million.\n\nThe grant will come from Pennsylvania\u2019s Redevelopment Assistance Capital Program.\n\nThe Center for Autism is a non-profit organization that was founded by renowned child psychiatrist Dr. Bertram A. Ruttenberg in 1955, and is the oldest autism treatment center in the country. As a leading provider of services in the Philadelphia region today, the Center serves over 1,000 individuals and families annually at its two Philadelphia locations.\n\nThe renovation project will also have a positive economic impact on the area, creating and impacting 230 jobs and generating additional local and state tax revenue. The total annual ongoing impact of the expansion project will exceed $4.2 million dollars.\n\nFARNESE ANNOUNCES $4 MILLION LANDMARK GRANTS\n\nState Sen. Larry Farnese (D-S. Phila.) reports the residents in the 1st Senatorial Dist. will soon be able to enjoy a more-exciting Gallery at Market East and a more-energy-efficient Academy of Music thanks to $4 million in grants from the Commonwealth.\n\n\n\nSEN. KITCHEN COUNSELING ON A.C.A. ON MONDAYS\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019ve recently walked east down Market Street, you can already see big changes, and thanks to a second phase of renovations the Gallery at Market East will continue to improve with the neighborhood. And just around the corner, the Academy of Music, from its chandelier to its roof, is being renovated and becoming more energy efficient,\u201d Farnese said. \u201cThese are two very-exciting projects and I\u2019d like to extend my congratulations to the Gallery at Market East and the Academy of Music on their grants.\u201d\n\nTo help more Philadelphians who need assistance in getting affordable health care insurance or Medicaid, State Sen. Shirley Kitchen (D-N. Phila.) said she will begin offering free counseling sessions every Monday morning at her Lehigh Avenue district office.\n\nThe sessions, beginning Dec. 22, are an extension of the seminars Kitchen began offering 3rd Senate District residents in November, and they will be designed to meet an immediate personal need for local residents.\n\n\u201cMany folks come to my office every day seeking answers and guidance as they consider Affordable Care Act insurance coverage or enrollment in Medicaid,\u201d Kitchen said. \u201cThe counseling sessions will help to make it more convenient for people who need help getting this done.\u201d\n\nSpecialists from the Pennsylvania Health Access Network will lead the counseling sessions, which will be held between 9:30 a.m. and noon on Mondays at her district office, 1701 Lehigh Avenue, Suite 104. People who are not enrolled in a health-care plan by Feb. 15 may have to pay a penalty.\n\nAppointments are required for each counseling session. No walk-in meetings will be allowed.\n\nTo schedule an appointment, call (877) 570-3642 or email helpline@pahealthaccess.org.\n\nBROWN HOSTS SENIOR CONCERT\n\nState Rep. Vanessa Lowery Brown (D-W.

I am also glad we are holding this event in a handicapped and wheelchair-accessible location so there are no barriers to sharing the holiday spirit.\u201d\n\nFor more information, please contact Brown\u2019s constituent service office at (215) 879-6615.\n\nPARKER AGAIN HEADS PHILLY DELEGATION\n\nState Rep. Cherelle L. Parker (D-Northwest) was reelected as the chairwoman of the Philadelphia Co. Delegation to the House of Representatives for the 2014-15 legislative session.\n\nParker, who was elected to her sixth term representing the 200th Legislative Dist., was voted back to the leadership post by fellow Philadelphia legislators from the Pennsylvania House.\n\n\u201cI am honored and humbled to have once again been elected by my colleagues to serve as the delegation chairwoman,\u201d Parker said. \u201cWe have 27 members representing Philadelphia, and while we each have issues unique to our individual districts, we are collectively working to advance effective public policy and enhance the quality of life of all Philadelphia, and Pennsylvania residents alike.\u201d\n\nState Reps. Kevin Boyle (D-Northeast), Jordan Harris (D-S. Phila.) and Steve Kinsey (D-N. Phila.) have been appointed to serve as the delegation\u2019s co-vice chairmen.\n\nUnder Parker\u2019s leadership, the delegation worked in a bipartisan, bicameral manner to enact the Philadelphia Tax Fairness Package; collectively advanced adequate investment in public transportation; and secured legislation to generate additional revenue for the grossly underfunded School District of Philadelphia. The delegation also continued to strengthen its working relationship with Mayor Nutter, Council President Darrell Clarke and all of Philadelphia City Council.\n\nPROGRESSIVE GROUP REELECTS GOODE\n\nCity Councilman at Large W. Wilson Goode, Jr., a Founding Board Member of Local Progress and National Chair of its Good Jobs Campaign, was reelected to the Board and participated in a plenary session on Fighting for Economic Justice & Workers\u2019 Rights held in New York City Hall.\n\nCouncilman Goode joined other officials to participate in the third national convening of Local Progress, a national municipal policy network of over 400 elected officials from over 40 states.\n\n\u201cThe third convening again brought public servants from around the country,\u201d Goode said. \u201cWe had an exciting exchange of progressive ideas on issues such as living-wage job creation.\u201d\n\nSABATINA WARNS ABOUT TELEPHONE SCAMMERS\n\nState Rep. John Sabatina (D-Northeast) is warning residents of Northeast Philadelphia to beware of a telephone scam currently operating in which taxpayers receive unsolicited calls from individuals claiming to be from the Internal Revenue Service and demanding payment.\n\n\u201cThis scam has been reported in multiple parts of the state, and now I\u2019ve received reports of it occurring to residents of the 174th Dist.,\u201d Sabatina said. \u201cPeople should always be cautious when giving out personal information over the phone, especially when the caller is aggressive and demanding payment on a supposed debt the call recipient didn\u2019t even know existed. The IRS always makes first contact through the mail, and would not make aggressive phone calls about payment.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, it is important for taxpayers to know that the IRS: Never asks for credit card, debit card or prepaid card information over the telephone; Never insists that taxpayers use a specific payment method to pay tax obligations and Never requests immediate payment over the telephone and will not take enforcement action immediately following a phone conversation. Taxpayers usually receive prior notification of IRS enforcement action involving IRS tax liens or levies.\n\nIf anyone believes they have been targeted by this scam, they should contact the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration to report the incident at 1 (800) 366-4484 or Sabatina\u2019s office at (215) 342-6204.\n\nCOUNCILMAN OH HOSTS YOUTH NONPROFIT SYMPOSIUM\n\nCouncilman at Large David Oh\u2019s 3rd annual Youth Non-Profit Symposium yesterday continues to connect and inspire more communication between non-profit youth organizations with corporations and foundations that provide funding.\n\n\u201cThe state of our economy and the budget cuts that our City faces has led to a shortage of governmental funding for many youth services. The need for youth nonprofit services is rising, but traditional government funding opportunities are shrinking,\u201d the Councilman stated. \u201cIt is often the case that non-profits do not know how or where to apply for funding from corporations and foundations. The vision of the Symposium is to create an open platform for discussion between nonprofits and funders.\u201d\n\nKeynote speaker was Sandra Baldino, chair and founder of Generocity.\n\nJOIN OUR NEWSPAPER Join over 3.000 visitors who are receiving our newsletter and learn how to optimize your blog for search engines, find free traffic, and monetize your website.
