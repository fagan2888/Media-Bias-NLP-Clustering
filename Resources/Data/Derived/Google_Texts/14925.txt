William Hilton Paul, 22, entered the plea in a Kentucky district court on Tuesday, according to The Daily Mail

William Paul had his driver’s license suspended for 45 days and was also billed $718 in penalties and court costs, it reported.

The University of Kentucky senior must additionally attend a safe-driving program as part of his sentencing, the publication added.

“Y’all have a good one,” William Paul reportedly told reporters upon leaving the courthouse Tuesday, declining any additional comments.

William Paul’s sentencing comes during his father’s 2016 GOP presidential campaign.

The Daily Mail said that the White House hopeful refused comment on Tuesday over “private family matters” such as his son’s legal woes.

Lexington police charged William Paul just before noon on April 19 after he crashed his 2006 Honda Ridgeline pickup into the back of a parked, unoccupied car.

William Paul allegedly smelled of alcohol and had “bloodshot, watery eyes” according to a police citation issued after the incident.

He was then transported to an area hospital for cuts on his face.

Once there, William Paul refused a breathalyzer and blood test.

William Paul’s citation in April was not his first for alcohol-related charges.

He was initially cited at age 19 with underage drinking and disorderly conduct after being arrested at a North Carolina airport in 2013.

Those charges were dropped once William Paul completed a diversion program.

William Paul would receive another citation that same year after his 20th birthday.

In that incident, William Paul was charged for possession of alcohol as a minor at a Kentucky racetrack.
