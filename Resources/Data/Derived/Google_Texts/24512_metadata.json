With the nation\u2019s landscape shifting to managing value-based risk, they\u2019re recognizing the value in extending care beyond the hospital and into the home.\n\n\u201cHealthcare delivery is being redefined,\u201d says Gregg Malkary, founder and managing director of the Spyglass Consulting Group, which conducted in-depth interviews with more than 100 health systems for its Trends in Remote Patient Monitoring 2015 report. \u201cThe whole dynamic is changing. Health systems are looking at how to take on population health, and they\u2019re (acquiring or teaming up with) home health systems to make that happen. Home health actually has a very important place at the table now.\u201d\n\nMalkary credits the passage of the Affordable Care Act with facilitating the move toward value-based care. As health systems assume more of the risk associated with caring for patients, they\u2019re recognizing the value of remote patient monitoring. They\u2019re also recognizing that they can\u2019t do it alone \u2013 at least not economically - and are either creating post-acute care networks or partnering with others in the health management chain to extend care into the home or other locations.\n\nThey\u2019re also recognizing the value of mHealth. A full 84 percent of those surveyed are using mobile devices \u2013 especially tablets \u2013 to support patients with chronic conditions at home or in a care facility. And a majority are looking to incorporate patient-owned devices like smartphones, or considering wearables like smartwatches and activity monitors.\n\nMalkary says those solutions have evolved beyond just collecting data and are now viable patient engagement platforms \u2013 a key component to moving beyond the post-discharge model of care and into the longer-term health management model. They\u2019re even taking a closer look at consumer-facing devices, the idea being that if it appeals to the patient, it will offer a platform through which the provider can have a voice and influence that patient\u2019s behavior.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a clear migration away from the solutions of yesteryear,\u201d said Malkary, referring to the more expensive, bulky and relatively stationary home monitoring platforms that dominated the marketplace just a few years ago. Today\u2019s solutions are smaller, less expensive and \u2013 most importantly \u2013 mobile, enabling provider and the patient to communicate and collaborate whenever and wherever both feel most comfortable.\n\nThose connections mean the providers are getting more data from different sources, and that\u2019s fueling yet another mHealth evolution: the rise of analytics. According to the Spyglass study, almost 80 percent of the health systems interviewed are embracing analytics and decision support tools that turn all that data into \u201cactionable knowledge and insights to help manage and monitor value based risk associated with population health.\u201d In other words, they\u2019re finding ways to take vital signs, diet and sleep patterns and activity measurements and convert them to quality metrics that facilitate improved outcomes and reduced hospitalizations.\n\nMalkary said he expects more and more health systems to launch remote patient monitoring programs, either by acquiring home health agencies or partnering with them. And he expects those programs to address not only chronic care, but seniors, post-discharge patients and others who could benefit from a platform that reaches outside the hospital and into the home. He also expects payers to either partner with health systems in these programs or even subsidize them altogether.\n\n\u201cThey can\u2019t afford not to explore what this means,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to want to experiment. It\u2019s a very bullish industry right now.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Health systems are bullish on remote patient monitoring", "author": "mHealthIntelligence", "og": {"url": "http://mhealthintelligence.com/news/new-study-is-bullish-on-remote-patient-monitoring", "type": "article", "image": "http://mhealthintelligence.com/images/site/articles/488001431.jpg", "site_name": "mHealthIntelligence", "title": "New Study is Bullish on Remote Patient Monitoring"}, "twitter": {"description": "Health systems are bullish on remote patient monitoring", "title": "New Study is Bullish on Remote Patient Monitoring", "image": {"src": "http://mhealthintelligence.com/images/site/articles/488001431.jpg"}, "creator": "@mHealthIntel", "site": "@mHealthIntel", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "As health systems assume more of the risk associated with caring for patients, they\u2019re recognizing the value of remote patient monitoring.\nMalkary said he expects more and more health systems to launch remote patient monitoring programs, either by acquiring home health agencies or partnering with them.\nHealth systems are looking at how to take on population health, and they\u2019re (acquiring or teaming up with) home health systems to make that happen.\n\u201cHealthcare delivery is being redefined,\u201d says Gregg Malkary, founder and managing director of the Spyglass Consulting Group, which conducted in-depth interviews with more than 100 health systems for its Trends in Remote Patient Monitoring 2015 report.\nHe also expects payers to either partner with health systems in these programs or even subsidize them altogether."}
