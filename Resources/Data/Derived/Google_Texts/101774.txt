A suspected drunk driver is accused of crashing into four vehicles and starting a brush fire.

The accident happened Friday night in Castle Rock.

State Patrol says someone reported a driver driving erratically north of Castle Rock on southbound I-25.

The driver exited the Interstate onto Meadows Founders Parkway and reportedly crashed into a vehicle in a parking lot. According to CBS Denver, State Patrol says the driver didn't stop and instead got back on the I-25 where he allegedly hit three other vehicles and kept going.

A grass fire started when the driver reportedly did a u-turn to get onto northbound I-25 at Tomah Road. The driver ran over stop sticks, blowing the truck's tires, but kept going. Sparks from the rims ignited dry grass along the side of the road.

The fire burned approximately a quarter acre and was quickly contained.

Deputies were finally able to stop the driver, identified as Garrett Neugebauer, 41 or Peyton, when he exited at Plum Creek in Castle Rock.

He was taken to the hospital with what law enforcement described as non-life-threatening injuries.

Two other crash victims were also taken to the hospital, but are expected to survive, according to CBS Denver.

Neugebauer is facing a long list of charges.
