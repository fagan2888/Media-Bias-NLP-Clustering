Junior offensive lineman Ted Field says he will stay at Garnet Valley instead of transferring to Cardinal O'Hara.

Ted Field, a rising junior offensive lineman and recent Rutgers commit, has decided to stay at Garnet Valley instead of transferring to Cardinal O'Hara.

The 6-foot-5, 325-pounder said Garnet Valley's block scheduling will allow him to achieve his goal of enrolling early at Rutgers in 2016.

Field said he was not returning to Garnet Valley because of the death of O'Hara head coach Algeo.

"Coach Algeo was a big inspiration to me and I'm glad I got the chance to meet him, but I still would have talked to him about staying at Garnet Valley and that being the best thing for me and my future."

Field, of Glen Mills, said he is "excited" about the opportunity to continue training under Garnet Valley offensive line coach and former NFL player Joe Valerio.
