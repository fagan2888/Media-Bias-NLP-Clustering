One of the most influential factors is a patient's perception of pain,\" Maher said in the research announcement. \"The universal unpleasantness and complicated nature of pain, especially in the post-operative setting, has the potential to negatively impact overall satisfaction if not optimally managed.\"\n\nPain scores and HCAHPS responses correlated far more closely for spinal surgery, non-spine orthopedics, and obstetrics and gynecology patients than other surgical patients, according to the announcement. These findings suggest patient satisfaction surveys, or more specifically their pain components, are not universally applicable enough to determine hospital reimbursements, Maher said.\n\nThe study results also suggest hospitals should explore anesthetic techniques that will improve their overall patient satisfaction (such as regional vs. general anesthesia), as well as preadmission, postoperative and intraoperative interventions, according to Maher.\n\nResearch conducted last year found that patient experience surveys can serve as a template for low-performing hospitals, as well as determine which care delivery areas should be their top priority, FierceHealthcare previously reported.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here's the study announcement (.pdf)\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nPatient experience surveys can guide low performers\n\nCosgrove: Patient experience key to healthcare quality", "article_metadata": {"description": "Postsurgical pain evaluations correlate with overall\u00a0patient satisfaction\u00a0scores during hospital stays,\u00a0according to\u00a0a new study presented at the American Academy of Pain Medicine's\u00a030th\u00a0Annual Meeting.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Postsurgical pain evaluations correlate with overall\u00a0patient satisfaction\u00a0scores during hospital stays,\u00a0according to\u00a0a new study presented at the American Academy of Pain Medicine's\u00a030th\u00a0Annual Meeting.", "title": "Pain control tied to patient satisfaction", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/pain-control-tied-patient-satisfaction/2014-03-07", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "American Academy of Pain Medicine,Care Delivery,HCAHPS Hospital Consumer Assessment Of Healthcare Providers,hospital reimbursement,Pain Management,Patient Care & Outcomes,patient satisfaction,patient satisfaction scores", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "article_summary": "Postsurgical pain evaluations correlate with overall patient satisfaction scores during hospital stays, according to a new study presented at the American Academy of Pain Medicine's 30th Annual Meeting.\nThese findings suggest patient satisfaction surveys, or more specifically their pain components, are not universally applicable enough to determine hospital reimbursements, Maher said.\n\"The universal unpleasantness and complicated nature of pain, especially in the post-operative setting, has the potential to negatively impact overall satisfaction if not optimally managed.\"\nOne of the most influential factors is a patient's perception of pain,\" Maher said in the research announcement.\nTo learn more:- here's the study announcement (.pdf)Related Articles:Patient experience surveys can guide low performersCosgrove: Patient experience key to healthcare quality"}
