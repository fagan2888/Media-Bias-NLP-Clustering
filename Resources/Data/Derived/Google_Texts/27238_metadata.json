Trey Gowdy laid waste to Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber\u2019s history of \u201cstupid\u201d comments at a House committee hearing Tuesday.\n\nGowdy asked Gruber about his comments on Obamacare and American voters one-by-one, asking the highly paid figure behind the law to explain what he meant in each instance. Consistently, Gruber responded by condemning his own remarks: \u201cinappropriate,\u201d \u201cinexcusable,\u201d \u201churtful,\u201d \u201cglib,\u201d \u201cinexcusable arrogance,\u201d and \u201coverstatement\u201d were the words and terms he used to describe his statements in retrospect.\n\n\u201cThe pervasiveness of your quotes is so much that it has to be \u2026 more than just an episodic mistake that you made,\u201d Gowdy said at one point, in-between his recitation of Gruber\u2019s many \u201cuninformed and glib comments.\u201d It got to the point at which the South Carolina rep stopped himself to ask the obvious.\n\n\u201cDo you see a trend developing here, Professor Gruber?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand the question,\u201d Gruber responded.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot of stupid quotes you\u2019ve made, that\u2019s the trend. You see them?\u201d\n\nThe grilling didn\u2019t stop there. Gowdy got Gruber to remark on his ego, a bare moment of such discomfort that it\u2019s almost advisable to hide your eyes and cover your ears.\n\n\u201cWhat is a non-politician doing talking about political advantages?\u201d Gowdy asked of one of Gruber\u2019s particular remarks.\n\n\u201cA non-politician is talking about political advantages to try to make himself seem smarter by conjecturing about something he doesn\u2019t really know about.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you\u2019re a professor at MIT and you\u2019re worried about not looking smart enough?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Gruber admitted uncomfortably.\n\n\u201cOK.
