The legislation, widely decried as a \u201crape insurance\u201d bill, incited fierce debate. One Democratic lawmaker shared her personal story of sexual assault on the floor, pointing out that women shouldn\u2019t be required to purchase a separate insurance rider in case they become pregnant from rape at some point in the future. Nonetheless, the bill passed along mostly party lines.\n\nSince the legislation was \u201ccitizen-initiated\u201d \u2014 the anti-choice community collected over 300,000 signatures to provoke a vote on the measure \u2014 it doesn\u2019t need the governor\u2019s signature, and will become law 90 days after lawmakers adjourn for the year. But reproductive rights activists still have options left. They could circulate a petition of their own to collect enough signatures for a public referendum, which would put the measure up for a statewide vote.\n\nPro-choice activists are already considering that type of ballot drive, according to the Associated Press. Democrats in the legislature are vowing to keep the pressure on this issue well into 2014. If they\u2019re successful, the insurance restriction will come up for a popular vote around the same time as next November\u2019s legislative elections.\n\nIn order to advance a referendum, Michigan state law requires activists to collect 161,305 signatures within 90 days of the legislature\u2019s adjournment. That\u2019s considerably fewer signatures than the anti-choice community needed to get this issue up for a vote. They were required to collect 258,088, a threshold which they ended up exceeding.\n\nWomen\u2019s health groups say there\u2019s plenty of evidence to suggest voters will reject the measure if it\u2019s subject to a popular vote. According to Michigan\u2019s chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), some of the lawmakers who voted for the bill represent districts where 60 to 70 percent of constituents are opposed to it. \u201cThey didn\u2019t see this as an abortion issue,\u201d ACLU lobbyist Shelli Weisberg explained to the AP. \u201cThey saw it as a coverage issue, as a privacy issue, as an issue that deals with commerce and not legislation. They didn\u2019t want the Legislature trying to interfere with medical decisions.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s the same reason that the state\u2019s Republican governor, Rick Snyder, vetoed the measure last year. Snyder pointed out that the legislation went too far to interfere in the private insurance market.\n\nOpponents are planning to gather on Monday morning to rally against the new law. \u201cThis is wrong. This is disgusting. We cannot let this prevail. Join us in the fight to repeal the Abortion Insurance Opt-Out Act,\u201d the Facebook event reads.\n\nNonetheless, Michigan is hardly the only state with this type of restriction on the books. Barring insurance coverage for abortion services is a popular method of attacking reproductive rights. Eight other states \u2014 Idaho, Kansas, Kentucky, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, and Utah \u2014 also restrict abortion coverage in all private insurance plans offered in the state. And nearly two dozen states bar Obamacare\u2019s new insurance marketplaces from including plans that cover abortion.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Michigan just approved a bill that forces women to purchase a separate insurance rider for abortion coverage.
