Ronald Zak/Associated Press\n\nOPEC REPORT WARNS ON DEPRESSED OIL PRICES\n\nAs the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC, starts its meeting, an internal report warns oil prices will remain low in the near future, even if the cartel cuts its production, Beno\u00eet Faucon reports. OPEC members are pessimistic about reaching an agreement to cut output.\n\nThe report warns \u201coverall the current surplus, while easing, should continue to cap the upside in oil prices for the coming quarters.\u201d Current OPEC production stands at 31.5 million barrels a day, and some members want to cut back to the group\u2019s production ceiling of 30 million barrels a day. But if OPEC scaled back to that level, it \u201cwould not be sufficient to completely clear the current supply overhang\u201d because of large amounts of oil in storage.\n\nBijan Zanganeh, Iran\u2019s oil minister, said there remained \u201clots of disagreements\u201d among ministers and the cartel was \u201cnot at all\u201d close to a deal on its output strategy. The group is expected to keep its production ceiling flat, without any increase for a new member it is expected to induct, Indonesia, which pumps 800,000 barrels a day.\n\nThe OPEC attempt to hang on to its market share by maintaining output levels is arguably failing in Asia, where countries like non-OPEC member Russia have been gaining market share, Jenny W. Hsu reports.\n\nThe oil-storage business is booming, Reuters writes. But crude shipping rates are set to fall next year because of new orders for oil tankers and tankers currently being used for storage expected to re-enter service transporting oil, Robbie Whelan reports. Coal-shipping lines will also have it rough.\n\nGOLDMAN TRIES A NEW COMMODITIES PLAY\n\nGoldman Sachs Group Inc. is taking a new lower-risk, lower-return approach to commodities, Christian Berthelsen and Justin Baer report. That includes providing operating cash and credit guarantees to Oahu\u2019s Hawaii Independent Energy, the state\u2019s largest supplier of jet and ship fuel, and a marketer of gasoline and diesel to retail outlets.\n\nJURY CONVICTS FORMER MASSEY CEO\n\nA jury convicted former Massey Energy Chief Executive Don Blankenship of conspiracy to violate federal mine-safety laws in connection with a 2010 coal mine explosion that killed 29 miners, Kris Maher reports. The jury acquitted him of lying to regulators and investors. Mr. Blankenship faces a maximum prison sentence of one year.\n\nMeanwhile, NRG Energy Inc. Chief Executive David Crane resigned amid investor dissatisfaction with his investments in renewable energy and the big drop so far this year in the power-generation company\u2019s share price, Rebecca Smith reports.\n\nMARKETS\n\nOil prices rose in volatile trading Friday with traders positioning as OPEC meeting got underway in Vienna. OPEC oil ministers are largely expected to stick to their year-old strategy of maintaining output in the face of a growing global glut and cheap oil.\n\nDespite vocal opposition from member countries such as Venezuela and Algeria that are suffering from the low oil prices, analysts see OPEC\u2019s most influential member Saudi Arabia remaining firm as it seeks to defend its share of the market.\n\n\u201cSome countries would like a production cut to spark higher prices, whilst other countries have a more long term agenda\u2014making sure, oil revenue is maximized over decades rather than years or months,\u201d said Michael Poulsen, oil analyst at Global Risk Management. \u201cOilmarket participants are on edge for whatever the outcome ends up being.\u201d\n\nRead our latest market report at wsj.com.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "As the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC, starts its meeting, an internal report warns oil prices will remain low in the near future, even if the cartel cuts its production.
