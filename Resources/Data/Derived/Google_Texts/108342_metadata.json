The museum was also a fitting host for the retrospective: As a young fashion student, McQueen studied its archives and once said it was \"the sort of place I'd like to be shut in overnight.\"\n\nThe exhibition is an expanded version of the 2011 show at New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art, which drew hundreds of thousands and became one of the most popular in the museum's history. The London show includes a new section focusing on McQueen's early London collections.\n\nThe highlight is the \"Cabinet of Curiosities,\" a darkened room lined floor-to-ceiling with some of his most dramatic designs: The monstrous, lobster claw \"armadillo shoe\" worn by Lady Gaga, a metal corset with a distorted animal-like spine, and many of his terrifying, tribal-inspired spiky headdresses.\n\nIn the middle of the room stands a rotating mannequin in a spray-painted dress, replicating the finale of a 1998 show in which a model revolved around a turntable while robots sprayed her with ink.\n\n\"We want to bring the sense of theater and spectacle that's associated with his catwalk shows,\" said researcher Kate Bethune. \"He was an incredible storyteller.\"\n\nBorn to a modest background \u2014 his father was a cab driver \u2014 McQueen trained as a tailor's apprentice in London's famed Savile Row before formally launching his career. He was celebrated for challenging conventional ideas of beauty, and often drew on macabre and violent themes for his runway displays, from Joan of Arc to English battles to mental asylums.\n\nThe exhibition gives visitors a chance to see his strange and beautiful creations up close, including clothes made entirely out of razor clam shells, hair, wood and glass. Bird feathers featured heavily \u2014 Bethune said he used to be a birdwatcher as a child.\n\nMcQueen fascinates people who normally take little interest in fashion, she added. The V&A said Thursday it has already sold more than 70,000 tickets.\n\n\"He made everything so real, he was so controversial and always had a strong point of view,\" she said. \"His imagination was completely limitless. I do believe he was an artist whose medium was fashion.\"\n\n\"Alexander McQueen: Savage Beauty\" opens Saturday and runs until Aug. 2.\n\n___\n\nOnline:\n\nwww.vam.ac.uk", "article_metadata": {"description": "'Homecoming' for McQueen as London stages blockbuster show - AP News: LONDON (AP) \u2014 \"Savage Beauty,\" the blockbuster Alexander McQueen exhibition .05/26/2016 0:45:35AM EST.", "author": "AP News", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "LONDON (AP) \u2014 \"Savage Beauty,\" the blockbuster Alexander McQueen exhibition first staged in New York,", "title": "AP News - 'Homecoming' for McQueen as London stages blockbuster show", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/world/2015/03/12/homecoming-for-mcqueen-as-london-stages-blockbuster-show-n1969643", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015\\71\\5a6c4048-ea8e-4efd-8ac9-02f41e555a7d.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "LONDON (AP) \u2014 \"Savage Beauty,\" the blockbuster Alexander McQueen exhibition first staged in New York,", "title": "AP News - 'Homecoming' for McQueen as London stages blockbuster show", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/world/2015/03/12/homecoming-for-mcqueen-as-london-stages-blockbuster-show-n1969643", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/71/5a6c4048-ea8e-4efd-8ac9-02f41e555a7d.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "'Homecoming' for McQueen as London stages blockbuster show, AP News, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2570\"", "article_summary": "LONDON (AP) \u2014 \"Savage Beauty,\" the blockbuster Alexander McQueen exhibition first staged in New York, is coming home to London.\n\"Alexander McQueen: Savage Beauty\" opens Saturday and runs until Aug. 2.\nBorn to a modest background \u2014 his father was a cab driver \u2014 McQueen trained as a tailor's apprentice in London's famed Savile Row before formally launching his career.\nThe V&A described the new show as a \"homecoming\" for the designer, who was born and trained in London and often took inspiration from the British capital.\nThe London show includes a new section focusing on McQueen's early London collections."}
