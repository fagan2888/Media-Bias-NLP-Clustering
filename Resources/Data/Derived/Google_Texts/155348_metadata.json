Having signed Granderson to a $60 million contract in the off-season, the Mets seemed to want to keep his bat in the middle of the order, where it could potentially do the most damage. Granderson had seldom batted leadoff for the Yankees, his previous team, with whom he hit 115 home runs in four seasons.\n\nBut with options running dry, Collins gambled, leaving David Wright a little less protected but putting some punch at the top of the order. Granderson rewarded the team by going 2 for 3 with a home run, two walks and a single in the Mets\u2019 3-1 win over the San Diego Padres at Citi Field.\n\n\u201cJust trying to get myself on base and get the team going,\u201d Granderson said. \u201cWe were able to keep things going and score another run in the first inning, and it ended up being enough.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nGranderson hit a deep home run to right to lead off the bottom of the first inning, a shot that \u2014 after the Mets were shut out, with only two hits, on Saturday \u2014 arrived a bit like a vending machine materializing in the middle of a desert.\n\n\u201cCurtis getting us out of the gate was huge for us,\u201d Collins said.\n\nGranderson is batting .375 in June, with three home runs and eight runs batted in, quietly stabilizing himself after a dreadful opening month. The Mets have treated him tenderly \u2014 he was recently held out of the lineup for three games because of calf soreness \u2014 while remaining confident in his potential for big swings of the bat.\n\nYet Collins left open the possibility that Granderson\u2019s move to the top of the order could start to look more permanent, even if Eric Young Jr., the team\u2019s regular leadoff hitter, returns from the disabled list on Monday. Collins, who certainly seemed pleased with what he saw, said reshaping the batting order to find ways to increase production remained a continuing effort.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of talk about who should hit where, or is he better off hitting in a different spot of the lineup where he can relax and do his thing,\u201d Collins said. \u201cObviously a lot of them haven\u2019t worked; I don\u2019t have to tell you that. But today getting out of the gate like that was a big lift for us.\u201d\n\nThe Mets sorely needed this win to close out their homestand, having lost nine of their previous 11 games. With the victory, they earned their first series win in June, and they now head to St. Louis tasked with measuring up against one of the best pitching staffs in baseball.\n\n\u201cThis was a big win for us, the way things have gone here lately,\u201d Collins said. \u201cTo win this game today is really a boost for everybody on the ball club.\u201d\n\nThings got off to an inauspicious start when, about 30 minutes before the first pitch, starter Daisuke Matsuzaka fell ill in the Mets\u2019 clubhouse. He took the mound regardless, but after his first pitch registered at only 84 miles per hour, Collins and the training staff quickly went to check on him.\n\n\u201cI just went out to ask him, \u2018Can he finish the inning?\u2019 \u201d Collins said. \u201cHe said, \u2018I have no strength, but I can finish the inning.\u2019 We had to get him out of there.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMatsuzaka lasted just that one inning, saying later that he felt fine until after he ate breakfast, the same breakfast his teammates had. He could not pinpoint the cause of the discomfort.\n\n\u201cI knew I wasn\u2019t physically fit to fulfill the starter\u2019s role,\u201d Matsuzaka said through an interpreter. \u201cBut I wanted to do as much as I could.\u201d\n\nBefore the game, Collins said he was looking for a long outing from Matsuzaka to spare the team\u2019s bullpen, so he might have felt a touch of illness upon Matsuzaka\u2019s abrupt exit as well.\n\nRegardless, long reliever Carlos Torres anchored the pitching staff for the rest of the afternoon, allowing one run in four innings, and Jenrry Mejia pitched two innings to close out the victory and earn his seventh save.\n\nINSIDE PITCH\n\nThe Mets announced that the left-hander Blake Taylor, a second-round pick by Pittsburgh in the 2013 draft, was the player named later in the trade that sent Ike Davis to the Pirates in April. Taylor will be assigned to the rookie-level Gulf Coast Mets.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140615174656, "twitter": {"description": "With a home run, two walks and a single, Curtis Granderson helped the Mets bounce back from a two-hit shutout loss, even as Daisuke Matsuzaka had to leave after an inning.", "title": "Batting Leadoff, Granderson Helps Mets Beat Padres", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/16/sports/baseball/granderson-batting-leadoff-helps-mets-beat-padres.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002941723"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/06/16/sports/METS/METS-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/16/sports/baseball/granderson-batting-leadoff-helps-mets-beat-padres.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002941723", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/16/sports/baseball/granderson-batting-leadoff-helps-mets-beat-padres.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "sports/baseball", "hdl_p": "Batting Leadoff, Granderson Helps Mets Beat Padres", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/sports/baseball/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "June 15, 2014", "edt": "NewYork", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/s/zach_schonbrun/index.html", "section": "Baseball", "modified": "2014-06-16", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/sports/baseball/index.jsonp", "tag": "Matsuzaka, Daisuke", "published": "2014-06-15", "section-taxonomy-id": "DE2B278B-2783-4506-AAD5-C15A5BB6DA1A"}, "keywords": "Baseball,New York Mets,San Diego Padres,Granderson  Curtis,Matsuzaka  Daisuke", "description": "With a home run, two walks and a single, Curtis Granderson helped the Mets bounce back from a two-hit shutout loss, even as Daisuke Matsuzaka had to leave after an inning.", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Zach Schonbrun", "SCG": "baseball", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Matsuzaka, Daisuke", "slug": "16mets", "byl": "By ZACH SCHONBRUN", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "With a home run, two walks and a single, Curtis Granderson helped the Mets bounce back from a two-hit shutout loss, even as Daisuke Matsuzaka had to leave after an inning.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/06/16/sports/METS/METS-thumbStandard.jpg", "news_keywords": "Baseball", "CG": "sports", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "June 15, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "org": "San Diego Padres", "thumbnail_height": 75, "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20140616133356, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/16/sports/baseball/granderson-batting-leadoff-helps-mets-beat-padres.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/06/16/sports/METS/METS-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "With a home run, two walks and a single, Curtis Granderson helped the Mets bounce back from a two-hit shutout loss, even as Daisuke Matsuzaka had to leave after an inning.", "title": "Batting Leadoff, Granderson Helps Mets Beat Padres"}, "pdate": 20140615, "des": "Baseball", "col": "Mets 3, Padres 1", "articleid": 100000002941723, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Batting Leadoff, Granderson Helps Mets Beat Padres", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/06/16/sports/METS/METS-thumbLarge.jpg", "PST": "News"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde6ca\"", "article_summary": "Granderson had seldom batted leadoff for the Yankees, his previous team, with whom he hit 115 home runs in four seasons.\n\u201cI just went out to ask him, \u2018Can he finish the inning?\u2019 \u201d Collins said.\nGranderson rewarded the team by going 2 for 3 with a home run, two walks and a single in the Mets\u2019 3-1 win over the San Diego Padres at Citi Field.\n\u201cJust trying to get myself on base and get the team going,\u201d Granderson said.\nGranderson is batting .375 in June, with three home runs and eight runs batted in, quietly stabilizing himself after a dreadful opening month."}
