Chris Christie video was nixed, will appear instead in Paramount Pictures \"Hercules.\" Photo courtesy of Paramount Pictures\n\nAdmit it, you tapped into this for the headline.\n\nWe promise not to disappoint in this week\u2019s takeaways from politics in New Jersey. Before we get to the really juicy stuff, let\u2019s start with a little business from Trenton involving the governor, a professional wrestler and a video camera.\n\nInterested? Read on.\n\nIf you care only about the naughty bits, they\u2019re at the end.\n\nLaying the smackdown on the gov\n\nA video released by Gov. Chris Christie\u2019s team this week apparently got a raised eyebrow from The Rock.\n\nThe professional wrestler and actor, whose given name is Dwayne Johnson, was featured in a little item the administration cooked up in advance of the governor\u2019s \u201cNo Pain, No Gain\u201d tour, in which he is planning to advocate for another round of pension reform.\n\nThe video was described this way by Asbury Park Press writer Dustin Racioppi:\n\n\u201cThe trailer was billed in an administration email as \u2018a must see\u2019 and an \u2018over-the-top summer action movie blockbuster.\u2019 It is something straight out of Michael Bay for beginners -- eerie tones, apocalyptic drum beats, a finale of explosions. Bay is best known for the Transformer movies.\u201d\n\nBut there was one small problem: The Rock didn\u2019t want to be in the video. So quietly and very quickly, the video was pulled down, edited and then put back up again, without Johnson.\n\nThe question, though, is how did this happen in the first place? The administration isn\u2019t really talking about it, but it seems like a slam dunk. When you put a video like this together, you get permission from public figures for their appearance in it.\n\nIt was an embarrassing mistake for an administration that supposedly wasn\u2019t going to make embarrassing mistakes. Not on the level of closing access lanes to the George Washington Bridge, but still\u2026\n\nEgea at the table\n\nSpeaking of the bridge scandal, Regina Egea, a key aide to Christie, had her time in the hot seat before the Legislature\u2019s special committee investigating the lane closings this week.\n\nThe biggest piece of information to come out of her testimony is that she spiked a text she sent to Christie about Bill Baroni\u2019s testimony before a legislative committee in December. The former deputy director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, at that hearing, gave a vigorous defense of what was then thought to be a traffic study.\n\nEgea said she didn\u2019t remember if Christie texted her back.\n\nThe key point of this revelation, however, was brought out by investigative panel co-chair John Wisniewski, a Demcratic assemblyman from Middlesex County. Gibson Dunn, the law firm that conducted the Christie administration\u2019s internal review of the involvement of the governor\u2019s office in the scandal, said its work was comprehensive. Christie has repeatedly echoed that assessment. Why, then, wasn\u2019t the spiked email caught?\n\n\"The fact that they imaged her phone, and we didn't get that document, is very disturbing, because it seems to me if they imaged her phone, and it had been deleted, they still would have had that data,\" Wisniewski said.\n\nAnd that casts even more doubt on the thoroughness of that $3 million report.\n\nA scandal not of our making\n\nNew Jersey has had its share of scandals. We don\u2019t need to mention them all, but from governors putting their lovers on the state payroll to closing traffic lanes to bridges (see above), there are plenty.\n\nBut sometimes, scandal visits us. Asbury Park Press writer Erik Larsen told the tale this week of President Warren Harding who set up his mistress and his daughter, whom he never met, in a house in Asbury Park.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine anything like this happening today. The mistress and child would likely be discovered, not unlike former Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards' paramour was found, and that would be that.\n\nHow would that have changed things? Harding likely would not have been elected. He died in office, so no Calvin Coolidge. What that might have meant for Herbert Hoover is anyone\u2019s guess.\n\nThe affair was never broadcast during Harding\u2019s lifetime. But his mistress, Nan Britton, did do something very 21st century four years after the president\u2019s death: She wrote a tell-all book, complete with the dirty details, as described in this Amazon.com entry:\n\n\u201cIn Chapter 18 she describes how on July 30, 1917 she finally lost her virginity to the future president after a long courtship, in a New York City hotel on 30th Street overlooking Broadway. Only moments after the intercourse had been completed, the New York City Vice Squad broke down the door. Harding was forced to identify himself. When the police realized that their target, Warren G. Harding, was a United States Senator (he was not yet president), the Vice Squad apologized and beat a hasty retreat.\u201d\n\nIf this happened now, she\u2019d be in a reality television show, challenging Kim Kardashian for cable supremacy. Alas, Britton died in 1991.\n\nRidiculous? It's the quote of the week\n\nWhen Christie, visiting Iowa, was asked what the next president needed to do to get the country and the economy back on track, he uttered this phrase:\n\n\"That's a little too broad and too ridiculous for me to address.\"\n\nOpinions and columns\n\nDid you miss some of our editorials and columns this week?
