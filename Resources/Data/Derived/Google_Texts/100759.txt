Pierre, SD

More Pierre teachers are taking the challenge.

"We challenge Buchanan," the teachers yelled as they poured ice water on themselves.

Last night we took you to Jefferson Elementary School, where teachers took the ice bucket challenge to raise money for the ALS Foundation.

Teachers across town at Buchanan responded to the challenge on Friday.

The fundraiser is spreading across the country. When people are challenged, they can donate to the association, dump ice water on their heads or they can do both.

ALS is also known as Lou Gehrig's disease and can affect a person's muscle control and movement.
