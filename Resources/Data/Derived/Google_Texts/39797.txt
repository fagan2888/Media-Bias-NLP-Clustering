The United Kingdom's Natural Environment Research Council announced a contest on Twitter to name its newest £200 million polar research vessel, and let's just say things aren't going according to plan.

We're building a new research ship and we need a name for her! #NameOurShip

Seems innocent enough, yes?

However, this is the internet age, and in an era where internet polls are easily and routinely hijacked for hilarious purposes, it should come as no surprise to anyone that the name leading the polls right now is..."Boaty McBoatface."

Steaming ahead of its rivals, RRS Boaty McBoatface is outstripping the likes of Endeavour, Henry Worsley, David Attenborough, Falcon and many more offerings. Some other tongue-in-cheek submissions include It’s bloody cold here, Usain Bolt, Ice Ice Baby and Notthetitanic. The £200 million polar research vessel, which will be operational in 2019, is set to sail the waters of Antarctica and the Arctic carrying a team of 90 scientists and support staff.

To NERC's credit, they're taking it in stride, and have been using the attention to promote the mission of its polar research vessels, as well as other information about the organization's mission.

Despite the overwhelming public response for the name, it's highly unlikely that the actual ship will be named the RRS Boaty McBoatface. The contest's fine print says that the name will actually be decided by NERC, regardless of public vote.

The ship will be launched in 2019.
