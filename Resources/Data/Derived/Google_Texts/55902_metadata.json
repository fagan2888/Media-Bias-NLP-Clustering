Experts say the battle's importance for health care in Western Pennsylvania will eclipse the other major developments in 2014: the implementation of the federal Affordable Care Act and a possible expansion of the state's Medicaid program.\n\n\u201cI think everybody is looking at Pittsburgh and saying, \u2018Wow. That's about as scary as it gets,' \u201d said Dave Matheson, a senior adviser at the Boston Consulting Group, who co-authored a study of the health care system in a November issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association.\n\nIn most health care markets, insurers and hospitals are able to hash out which entity will manage a patient's care \u2014 the company paying for it or the hospital providing it. But it didn't work out that way in Pittsburgh, Matheson said.\n\n\u201cBoth players saw themselves as sufficiently powerful and strong to be playing those roles \u2014 and they felt entitled to play those roles,\u201d Matheson said.\n\nState lawmakers could force the two to come to terms. State Reps. Dan Frankel, D-Squirrel Hill, and Jim Christiana, R-Beaver County, introduced a pair of bills that would require UPMC to negotiate a contract with Highmark, and force the two into arbitration if they can't come to terms.\n\n\u201cIf you listen to Highmark, they're betting on legislation that will be passed that will require UPMC to be a part of Highmark's network. If you talk to UPMC, they say that doesn't make sense for us,\u201d said Tom Tomczyk, a principal in the Downtown benefits consulting firm Buck Consultants.\n\nUPMC mounted a campaign against the bills, urging its employees to call lawmakers to voice opposition and distributing what Frankel and Christiana characterized as campaign-style fliers.\n\n\u201cWhen it gets in politicians' hands, you just never know what's going to happen,\u201d Tomczyk said.\n\nThe United States spends more on health care than any other country. A report by the International Federation of Health Plans found the average cost of a day in a U.S. hospital was $4,287, with some costing more than $12,000 a day. In Australia, the country with the next-highest average, it costs just $1,472 a day, the study found.\n\nThe recession helped slow the growth of health care costs.\n\n\u201cOver the last 10 years or so, we've had significantly lower increases in the total amount of health care expenditures,\u201d Matheson said.\n\nThe Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services found health care spending from 2009 to 2011 grew at the slowest rate \u2013 3.9 percent a year \u2013 since the federal government began tracking spending in 1960. The slow growth coincided with the broader economy's sluggish recovery from the worst downturn since the Great Depression.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act's effect on health care costs will become clearer as more provisions of the law are implemented in 2014.\n\n\u201cThe biggest thing we're looking at on our end is really the Medicaid expansion and what is going to happen in the next year,\u201d said Antoinette Kraus, director of the Pennsylvania Health Access Network, a public advocacy organization that focuses on access to health care.\n\nExpanding Medicaid, as authorized by the health care law, would bring billions of federal dollars to Pennsylvania, and cover 500,000 poor people. Corbett initially rejected the money, saying it would cost the state too much when federal support shrinks in future years.\n\nIn December, he asked the federal government for permission to use the Medicaid money for a hybrid program that would help the working poor buy private health insurance rather than insure them through the government program.\n\nThe issue is fraught with politics. Republican governors in 20 states, and Republican legislators in three others, have rejected Medicaid expansion, a move that's in line with the party's broader opposition to the Affordable Care Act.\n\nIf the Obama administration doesn't grant Corbett's request, \u201cthe question is, is the governor going to walk away and say, \u2018I tried. The federal government didn't approve it?' \u201d Kraus said.\n\nThe issue could influence the governor's race this year, she said. If the Medicaid expansion doesn't happen, Democrats could attack Corbett for \u201cleaving money on the table\u201d and failing to help the working poor get insurance. If Corbett gets approval for his hybrid expansion, he can tout \u201chow they were able to create this new, innovative Medicaid system,\u201d Kraus said.\n\nA larger test for the Affordable Care Act will be how many uninsured people sign up for coverage through the federal or state-run exchanges. Sixteen states and the District of Columbia built their own exchanges. Eight states run their exchanges in partnership with the federal government. The feds run the exchanges in 26 states, including Pennsylvania.\n\n\u201cThis is a particularly interesting year because you do have the implementations of the exchanges, which are a very big part of the Affordable Care Act, and I guess we will eventually know how many of those exchanges have begun to work and how many have fallen flat on their face,\u201d Matheson said.\n\nThe federal exchange got off to a rocky start, when its website, healthcare.gov, failed to work properly for the first couple of months.\n\n\u201cIt's almost inevitable that you will have some that fail pretty badly because there are a lot of them,\u201d Matheson said.\n\nThe mixed outcome likely will allow the political battles over the health care law to continue. Republicans will hold up the worst-performing insurance exchanges as proof that the law doesn't work, while Democrats will trumpet the successful ones to show they did the right thing, Matheson said.\n\n\u201cI think there's a lot of uncertainty,\u201d Tomczyk said. \u201cThere are going to be winners and losers.\u201d\n\nMike Wereschagin is a staff writer for Trib Total Media.
