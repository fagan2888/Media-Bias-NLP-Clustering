The co-director of Emory University\u2019s Center for AIDS Research Center, Dr. Carlos del Rio, was quoted as saying, \u201cDowntown Atlanta is as bad as Zimbabwe.\u201d\n\nRecently released studies show that HIV/AIDS in Atlanta, Georgia is so widespread, doctors and scientists are calling it an epidemic and comparing it to the outbreak in New York during the 1980s.\n\nA 2014 Emory University Center for AIDS report included the following statistics about the deadly disease:\n\nAtlanta ranks fifth in new infections\n\nThe southern region of the United States has the highest risk of contracting HIV\n\n1 in 6 men having sex with men risk infection\n\n1 in 473 heterosexual men risk infection\n\nA 2016 prediction from the CDC estimated that 1 in 51 Georgians will contract HIV in their lifetime, making Georgia only second in that regard to Louisiana.\n\nFactors contributing to the increase in HIV infections in the African-American community include racial disparities in health care, poverty, the lack of HIV education, and the lack of funding for education and prevention programs.\n\nOn Thursday\u2019s edition of NewsOne Now, Roland Martin spoke with an expert panel of guests about the shocking HIV/AIDS epidemic in Atlanta, why the disease seems to be spreading uncontrollably in the city, and what can be done to reverse the trend.\n\nDr. David Malebranche, a physician with expertise in men\u2019s health, LGBT health, and the clinical prevention and management of HIV and STIs (sexually transmitted infections), explained there is not a lot of mobilization taking place to confront the so-called epidemic in Atlanta.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll see certain churches, certain community organizations getting involved in things, but as far as this global outrage about what\u2019s going on in Atlanta, you don\u2019t see that as commonly as you would in other cases,\u201d he said.\n\nDr. Malebranche added that some of the statistics released about the epidemic are, in his opinion, \u201conly estimates.\u201d He said the problems highlighted by the recent reports have been \u201cgoing on with gay and bisexual men since 2001.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is absolutely nothing new, but people are going to act brand new as if this is something that they\u2019ve never heard about.\u201d\n\nMartin questioned whether the infection rates in Atlanta are comparable to Zimbabwe and inquired as to who should be leading the charge to reverse this alarming trend.\n\nMalebranche explained the response should be launched from a \u201cgroup level,\u201d in which the LGBT community and the medical community band together.\n\nWhile he believes this is viable solution to slowing infection rates, Dr. Malebranche also believes the medical community is at fault. \u201cWhen you look at the medical community, it\u2019s not going to be representative of the epidemic,\u201d he said. \u201cMost of the providers and researchers that are doing the work in treating and trying to prevent HIV infections are non-Black personnel, and so there\u2019s a disconnect sometimes with cultural competency.\u201d\n\nHe said many in the medical profession are not able to draw the parallel of looking at the person they are treating and saying \u201cThis could be my aunt, this could be my uncle, this could be my brother, this could be my father.\u201d\n\nBeing that Georgia is controlled by Republican legislators/lawmakers, the doctor said, \u201cYou keep seeing funding being slashed and cut for HIV services\u201d and \u201cGeorgia is one of those states that won\u2019t expand Medicaid so that it can participate in the Affordable Care Act\u202674 percent of people in Atlanta are going to fall into that kind of coverage gap, where they make too much money to get covered by things, but too little to get some of the services that they need.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome of these systematic forces, from a policy level, from an institutional level, and within the medical community itself, are part of the problem.\u201d\n\nWatch Roland Martin and the NewsOne Now panel discuss the alarming HIV infection rates in Atlanta in the video clip above, then watch part two of this important discussion below.\n\nMartin\u2019s panel of expert guests include:\n\nDr. David Malebranche: Physician working in the field of HIV/AIDS, both research and clinical.
