That was an approved ingredient in a drug called Meridia that was taken off the market in 2010 for causing heart problems and strokes.\n\nThe Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act does not require FDA approval for supplemental dietary drugs. Manufacturers are responsible for making sure the products are safe and that the claims made about their drugs are true.\n\nSlim-K, Slim-Vie, Bee Slim and V26 Slimming Coffee are among the products that the FDA has placed on its list of tainted weight loss products.\n\nFDA regulators say the warning signs that a product is tainted include promises of a quick fix and the use of the words \u201cguaranteed\u201d or \u201cscientific breakthrough. Consumers should also be wary, the agency said, if the product is marketed in a foreign language, through mass emails or as an herbal alternative to an FDA-approved drug.\n\nBefore taking any weight loss product, the FDA suggests checking with a healthcare professional.\n\nThough the administration has approved drugs like Belviq, Qsymia, and Contrave to help people manage long-term weight loss, Dr. James Smith, acting deputy director of the FDA\u2019s division of metabolism and endocrinology products, said the only natural way to lose weight is to burn more calories than you take in.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The agency said the weight loss products can cause \"serious harm.\"", "description": "The agency said the weight loss products can cause \"serious harm.\"", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Lydia Wheeler", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The agency said the weight loss products can cause \"serious harm.\"", "title": "'Miracle' weight loss?
