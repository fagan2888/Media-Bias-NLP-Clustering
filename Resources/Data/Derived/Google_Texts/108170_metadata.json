They also don\u2019t know how vitally important it is to the legislative process, especially where taxes, spending and entitlement reform are concerned. As Dan Mitchell, a well-respected economist with the libertarian Cato Institute, puts it in an email, the CBO \u201chas a number-crunching role that gives the bureaucracy a lot of power to aid or hinder legislation, so it is very important for Republicans to select a director who understands the economic consequences of excessive spending and punitive tax rates.\u201d\n\n\n\n[SEE: Political Cartoons on the Economy]\n\nIndeed, as Mitchell alludes, the change in the control of Congress suggests the CBO will shortly have a new director. Who it should be and what the new director will be asked to do is quietly being discussed on Capitol Hill and in the lobbying shops, law firms, trade associations and other groups inside the Beltway whose legislative initiatives may live or die based upon a single CBO number.\n\n\"First and foremost, the CBO director must be respected by both sides of the aisle. While he or she might have a bias one way or the other, the work must be credible enough to stand for itself, removed from partisanship as much as possible,\u201d says Chad Moutray, the chief economist at the National Association of Manufacturers, one on the city\u2019s most influent trade groups, in an email.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of major decisions that will be forthcoming in the next few years, including possible reforms to the tax code, entitlements and health care spending programs. We need a CBO director who can be an honest broker for each of these reforms for scoring purposes,\" Moutray says.\n\n\u201cCBO provides extensive evidence of a basic truth: Washington spends too much money. It should be led by an honest broker, because CBO's analysis should be rooted in reality, independent of political games. Our spending problems don\u2019t lie with the number crunchers at CBO, but Washington politicians addicted to wasting taxpayers\u2019 hard-earned paychecks,\u201d adds Brian Baker, the president of the non-profit group Ending Spending, in an email.\n\nAs established by Congress in the post-Watergate era, the CBO director \u2013 backed by a staff of close to 200 hundred employees \u2013 is responsible for determining how much proposed legislation will cost the government. That may not be a fair measure or even a necessary one, but that\u2019s currently its job. As such, the kind of economic models used to make such determinations are important.\n\n\n\n[READ: Paul Ryan's Dynamic Scoring Would Reveal Real Benefits of Tax Reform]\n\nAs one illustration, there is an oft-told tale among budget and tax policy wonks of a time at which CBO was asked to estimate the total amount of revenue that would flow into federal coffers if the income tax were increased to 100 percent. The point of the story is that any answer other than zero would be incorrect \u2013 at 100 percent the tax rate would be so high that no one would work, hence no revenue would be produced \u2013 but that the CBO instead came up with some number (it varies depending on who is telling the story) because the model it used to make its prediction didn\u2019t take into account the impact of the new rate on economic activity.\n\nThere are several names being bandied about for the job of CBO director, among them Bill Beach, who is currently the chief economist for the Senate Budget Committee, the Tax Foundation\u2019s Steve Entin, and J.D. Foster, an economist with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce who once was a top aide to former House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer, R-Texas. All understand well the difference between static and dynamic analysis \u2013 one method takes into account how changes in tax policy affect economic activity while the other does not \u2013 and have the economic chops to lead an effort to reform the CBO from within.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion]", "title": "Republicans Need to Make the Right Choice for CBO Director", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Republicans need to find the right person to set Congress' scorekeeper straight.", "title": "A New Direction for the CBO", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/peter-roff/2014/11/14/republicans-need-to-make-the-right-choice-for-cbo-director", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/d1/e2/a7babde94b9296a0c67173e1c464/141114-cbo-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Republicans need to find the right person to set Congress' scorekeeper straight.", "site": "@USNews", "card": "summary", "title": "Republicans Need to Make the Right Choice for CBO Director"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "opinion", "date_published": "Nov. 14, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Peter Roff,Congressional Budget Office,federal budget,tax cuts,Republican Party,Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion]", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Republicans need to find the right person to set Congress' scorekeeper straight."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0ec7\"", "article_summary": "We need a CBO director who can be an honest broker for each of these reforms for scoring purposes,\" Moutray says.\n\"First and foremost, the CBO director must be respected by both sides of the aisle.\nAs established by Congress in the post-Watergate era, the CBO director \u2013 backed by a staff of close to 200 hundred employees \u2013 is responsible for determining how much proposed legislation will cost the government.\nMost Americans don\u2019t know what the CBO is, how it was created or what it does.\nThere are several names being bandied about for the job of CBO director, among them Bill Beach, who is currently the chief economist for the Senate Budget Committee, the Tax Foundation\u2019s Steve Entin, and J.D."}
