He's been likened to Joe McCarthy, accused of behaving like a schoolyard bully, and smeared by senior members of his own party. Is this any way to get ahead in Washington? Well, Cruz is no dummy\u2014just ask him\u2014and his swift rise might prove that it's the only way\n\nIt\u2019s hard for Ted Cruz to be humble. Part of the challenge stems from his r\u00e9sum\u00e9, which the Texas senator wears like a sandwich board. There\u2019s the Princeton class ring that\u2019s always on his right hand and the crimson gown that, as a graduate of Harvard Law School, he donned when called upon to give a commencement speech earlier this year. (Cruz\u2019s fellow Harvard Law alums Barack Obama and Mitt Romney typically perform their graduation duties in whatever robes they\u2019re given.) Even Cruz\u2019s favorite footwear, a pair of black ostrich-skin cowboy boots, serves as an advertisement for his credentials and connections. \"These are my argument boots,\" he told me one morning this summer as we rode the subway car beneath the Capitol to a vote on the Senate floor. \"When I was Texas solicitor general, I did every argument in these boots. The one court that I was not willing to wear them in was the U.S. Supreme Court, and it was because my former boss and dear friend William Rehnquist was still chief justice. He and I were very close\u2014he was a wonderful man\u2014but he was very much a stickler for attire.\"\n\nIt was only after Rehnquist died that Cruz felt comfortable wearing his cowboy boots in the Supreme Court\u2014and only then because John Roberts (\"a friend for many years\") blessed it. \"I saw John shortly after his confirmation,\" Cruz said, \"and I guess I was feeling a little cheeky, because I took the opportunity to ask, \u2019Mr. Chief Justice, do you have any views on the appropriateness of boots as footwear at oral argument?\u2019 And Chief Justice Roberts chuckled and he said, \u2019You know, Ted, if you\u2019re representing the state of Texas, they\u2019re not only appropriate, they\u2019re required.\u2019 \"\n\nCruz, 42, arrived in Washington in January as the ultimate conservative purist, a hero to both salt-of-the-earth Tea Partiers and clubby GOP think-tankers, and since then he has come to the reluctant but unavoidable conclusion that he is simply more intelligent, more principled, more right\u2014in both senses of the word\u2014than pretty much everyone else in our nation\u2019s capital. That alone isn\u2019t so outrageous for the Senate. \"Every one of these guys thinks he\u2019s the smartest guy in the room,\" one senior Democratic aide told me. \"But Cruz is utterly incapable of cloaking it in any kind of collegiality. He\u2019s just so brazen.\"\n\nLittle more than a month after Cruz was sworn in, Senator Barbara Bo, a Democrat from California, likened him to Joe McCarthy for his conduct during Chuck Hagel\u2019s confirmation for secretary of defense. Without presenting a shred of evidence, Cruz insinuated that Hagel, a fellow Republican, was on the take from America\u2019s enemies. Because Hagel had declined to reveal the source of a $200,000 payment, Cruz suggested, how do we know it didn\u2019t come from the North Korean government? Or Saudi Arabia\u2019s? Even South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham, also a Republican, called Cruz\u2019s line of inquiry \"out of bounds.\"\n\nAnd then there was the moment, just a month later, when the Judiciary Committee was debating the assault--weapons ban: Cruz was trying to get it through Democratic senator Dianne Feinstein\u2019s thick skull that there was this thing called the Second Amendment and that it deserved the same respect as the rest of the Bill of Rights. He made his point by rattling off other amendments and the rights they protected until Feinstein bristled, \"I\u2019m not a sixth grader. I\u2019ve been on this committee for twenty years.... I\u2019ve studied the Constitution myself. I am reasonably well educated, and I thank you for the lecture.\"\n\nFor a while, veteran Republicans groused in private about the new guy. But it boiled over when Cruz joined Kentucky senator Rand Paul\u2019s filibuster of John Brennan\u2019s nomination to head the CIA\u2014an act of protest against Obama\u2019s drone program. John McCain, already seething over Cruz\u2019s treatment of Hagel, called them \"wacko birds.\" \"He fucking hates Cruz,\" one adviser of the Arizona senator told me. \"He\u2019s just offended by his style.\"\n\nThe \"wacko bird\" dig, however, has only endeared Cruz more to his party\u2019s purist wing. Already his fans are nudging him to think about a presidential run in 2016, and he\u2019s nudging right back, making trips to Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina. He\u2019s even embraced \"wacko bird,\" reclaiming McCain\u2019s knock as a badge of honor. Later on the day I visited him on Capitol Hill, Cruz was engaging in the kind of showing off that even his detractors might forgive: He was giving me a tour of his Senate office. \"A couple of things I keep,\" he said, picking up a red leather rectangle branded with the words IT CAN BE DONE\u2014a replica, he explained, of the sign that sat on President Reagan\u2019s desk in the Oval Office. The tchotchke he was most excited to show me, however, was a black baseball cap with a picture of Daffy Duck next to the words WACKO BIRD. Supporters back in Texas made it, Cruz said, grabbing the hat from its prominent perch on his bookshelf. \"Isn\u2019t it great?\"\n\nBut all along, what kept drawing my eye was a giant oil painting above the couch depicting Cruz as he delivered the first of his nine oral arguments before the Supreme Court. \"I was 32 years old,\" he recalled. \"It was abundantly clear we didn\u2019t have a prayer.... And I\u2019ve always enjoyed the fact that as I\u2019m sitting at my desk, I\u2019m looking at a giant painting of me getting my rear end whipped 9-0.\" He gazed at the wall. It is an unusual painting: From the artist\u2019s vantage point, we see three other courtroom artists, each also drawing Cruz\u2014so the painting actually features not one but four images of young Cruz before the bench. \"It is helpful,\" he explained to me, \"for keeping one grounded.\"\n\nTed Cruz doesn\u2019t look much like a wacko bird. With his pomaded black hair and trim suits\u2014the kind you might expect on a former partner at an international law firm, say, or the husband of a Goldman Sachs executive\u2014the more appropriate avian metaphor would seem to be a peacock. He doesn\u2019t sound much like a wacko bird, either. Cruz is a dazzling orator, speaking not merely in precise sentences but complete paragraphs\u2014no teleprompter, sometimes not even a podium\u2014and name-dropping everyone from Reagan to Rawls (as in John, the late Harvard philosopher).\n\nBut as Cruz and his supporters define it, \"wacko bird\" describes more of a state of mind. Or as Cruz put it on the Senate floor a few weeks before my visit, in the midst of yet another fight with McCain, this time over the rules for negotiating a budget: \"It has been suggested that those of us who are fighting to defend liberty\u2014fighting to turn around the out-of-control spending and out-of-control debt in this country, fighting to defend the Constitution, it has been suggested that we are wacko birds. Well, if that is the case, I will suggest to my friend from Arizona, there may be more wacko birds in the Senate than is suspected.\"\n\nHe might be right. This certainly feels like a wacko-bird moment in Washington, and maybe in America, too. It\u2019s a time when governmental breakdown and public antipathy for the profession of politics have combined to create a perverse incentive structure for congressional Republicans\u2014one that punishes politeness and cooperation and rewards antagonism and obstruction. So far Cruz has proposed no major legislation and has shown little interest in changing that. He seems content accomplishing nothing because, in Cruz\u2019s view of the federal government, nothing is the accomplishment.\n\nContrast this approach with the recent fate of that other precocious Republican in the Senate, Florida\u2019s Marco Rubio, who spent the first half of this year crafting bipartisan immigration reform\u2014the kind of grand, reach-across-the-aisle gesture that could serve as a springboard to a presidential campaign. And for his trouble, he wound up with no law (his bill passed the Senate but is seemingly DOA in the House) and a dented reputation among the very people who put him in office. Cruz, a second-generation Cuban-American with a story so singular that it verges on the novelistic, was one of the most outspoken opponents of Rubio\u2019s bill.\n\n\"Stopping bad things,\" Cruz told me, \"is a significant public service.\"\n\nAbout that family story: American voters have a hard time resisting politicians with a good one. Ted Cruz\u2019s is great, and he\u2019s even better at telling it.\n\nHe was born in Canada, in 1970, but his tale, as he likes to say, begins fourteen years earlier in a Cuban jail cell. His father, Rafael, had belonged to Castro\u2019s rebel forces fighting to overthrow the Batista dictatorship, and on the night of Rafael\u2019s seventeenth birthday in 1956, Batista\u2019s goons caught up with him. \"He got captured and he disappeared,\" Cruz told me one day over lunch at a Tex-Mex restaurant in Houston.\n\n\"My grandfather began searching for him, and he just began visiting the jails, going to one after the other after the other. And he eventually found him. He had been beaten so much that there was not a spot of white visible on his suit. It was all stained with mud and blood, and his teeth were dangling out of his mouth.\" After managing to get Rafael out of prison, Cruz\u2019s grandfather told his son that he needed to leave Cuba or the goon squad would find him again. \"He said, \u2019They know who you are. They\u2019re just going to hunt you down and kill you.\u2019 \"\n\nRafael applied to college in the United States and was admitted to the University of Texas. He secured a student visa, and in 1957 he arrived in Austin. \"He was 18, and he couldn\u2019t speak English, and he had a hundred dollars sewn into his underwear,\" Cruz said. \"The only possession he had was a slide rule in his pocket.\" (Parts of the elder Cruz\u2019s saga have an air of myth-making\u2014he got into the University of Texas without speaking a word of English? He got out of Batista\u2019s prison...how, exactly?)\n\nIn between bites of queso flameado, Cruz went on to explain how Rafael put himself through college by washing dishes for fifty cents an hour, learned English from math classes, met an American woman he would soon marry, and recognized the error of his ways in supporting Castro. \"He ended up graduating with a math degree and getting a job and eventually starting a small business and working toward the American Dream,\" Cruz said. \"I think it is an enormous blessing to be the child of an immigrant who fled oppression and came here seeking freedom, because there was an urgency in politics. Having principled men and women in office is how you protect yourself from tyranny, and that was something I learned from when I was 2, 3, 5 years old.\"\n\nCruz has been telling his father\u2019s story for decades. As a champion debater at Princeton, Cruz would frequently deploy it in competition. \"I heard that exact narrative about a hundred dollars sewn in his father\u2019s underwear,\" recalls Austan Goolsbee, a former Obama economic adviser who was Cruz\u2019s main rival on the college debate circuit in the early \u201990s. \"We all knew the story.\"\n\nToday, Cruz talks about his father so much that as his political star has risen, so has Rafael\u2019s. At the age of 74, the elder Cruz is now a Tea Party celebrity, a sought-out speaker who likens Obama to Castro (\"that old bearded friend I left behind in Cuba\") and whose words are often rebroadcast by Glenn Beck and Rush Limbaugh. For Ted, this recognition has been the most enjoyable by-product of his own political success. \"I\u2019ve really had two heroes in my life,\" he says. \"My father and Ronald Reagan.\"\n\nBut there\u2019s one part of Rafael\u2019s story that Cruz purposefully omits, and it might be the most affecting\u2014and offers perhaps the most revealing window into Ted\u2019s own youthful determination. Cruz\u2019s father had started an oil and gas exploration business, then moved with his wife to Calgary, where Ted was born. (Cruz\u2019s supporters say\u2014and most legal experts agree\u2014that his Canadian birth would not be an obstacle should he ever run for the White House, since, by dint of his mother\u2019s American citizenship, he qualifies as a natural-born American citizen.) In 1974 the family followed the oil business to the Houston suburbs, where Ted would enjoy a typical American adolescence. But then, in the \u201980s, when Ted was in high school, the oil industry briefly cratered, and his father\u2019s business tumbled down with it. He went bankrupt. Eventually his marriage crumbled as well.\n\nWhen I brought up the bankruptcy one afternoon in Cruz\u2019s office\u2014I had learned about it from one of his college friends\u2014his face fell and he grew quiet. After a moment, he let out a long sigh and acknowledged that this was true. \"My father poured all of my parents\u2019 personal assets into the company, and demand for oil and gas exploration just disappeared, because oil prices dropped so low. There\u2019s a whole generation of people in the energy industry at that time that just lost everything.\"\n\nInstead of derailing Cruz\u2019s sky-high ambitions, his father\u2019s financial calamity only intensified his drive. In the middle of his junior year, he persuaded his parents to take him out of the high school he was attending\u2014a small evangelical school that met in a former Handy Dan hardware store\u2014and send him to a more academically rigorous Baptist academy.\n\nBy then Cruz had already fallen under the spell of a conservative impresario named Rolland Storey, a onetime vaudevillian and retired natural-gas executive who ran a Houston-area think tank called the Free Enterprise Institute. At the institute, Cruz studied right-wing icons Friedrich Hayek, Ludwig von Mises, and Milton Friedman. He also mastered a mnemonic version of the Constitution, which he\u2019d recite, along with four other high school students, for Kiwanis, Rotary, and other civic clubs across Texas. They performed as a troupe called the Constitutional Corroborators.\n\nPrinceton turned out to be as alien to Cruz as Austin had been to his father some thirty years earlier: \"I did not know anybody there; I didn\u2019t know anybody who had gone there.\" Like his father, he needed to earn tuition money. Unlike his father, he didn\u2019t do it by washing dishes. He got a job with the Princeton Review, teaching test-prep classes.\n\nThe elite academic circles that Cruz was now traveling in began to rub off. As a law student at Harvard, he refused to study with anyone who hadn\u2019t been an undergrad at Harvard, Princeton, or Yale. Says Damon Watson, one of Cruz\u2019s law-school roommates: \"He said he didn\u2019t want anybody from \u2019minor Ivies\u2019 like Penn or Brown.\"*\n\nTed Cruz blew his first big shot in politics. Back in 2000, he had scored a plum assignment working in the policy shop of George W. Bush\u2019s Austin-based presidential campaign. He distinguished himself in the weeks after the election, serving on the legal team that helped Bush win the Florida recount and, by extension, the White House. He seemed destined for a meaty job in the new administration.\n\nBut Cruz\u2019s personal style earned him many detractors in BushWorld. He was infamous for firing off mundane work e-mails in the middle of the night\u2014it happened so often that some in the Bush campaign suspected him of writing them ahead of time and programming his computer to send while he was asleep. He was also known for dispatching regular updates on his accomplishments that one recipient likened to \"the cards people send about their families at Christmas, except Ted\u2019s were only about him and were more frequent.\" When it came time to divvy up the spoils of victory, many of Cruz\u2019s campaign colleagues headed to the White House; Cruz went to Washington, too\u2014but he was exiled to the outer Siberia of the Federal Trade Commission. Says one friend: \"He was pretty crushed.\"\n\nCruz lasted two years at the FTC, then returned to Austin and was appointed Texas\u2019s solicitor general. His new boss, the state\u2019s attorney general, wanted to use the office as a platform for advancing conservative legal theories on politically charged issues such as religion and state\u2019s rights. Cruz was the perfect instrument for such a mission. Although he lost that first Supreme Court case, he went on to win four of his next eight, including the landmark Medell\u00edn v. Texas, affirming\u2014in defiance of an international court ruling as well as an order from President Bush\u2014the state\u2019s right to execute a Mexican citizen who\u2019d participated in the gang rape and murder of two teenage girls in Houston. Legal publications hailed him as one of the finest appellate attorneys in America. He was being talked up for a federal judgeship, possibly even the Supreme Court one day.\n\nBut Cruz did not want to serve on the bench. In November 2010, he made a trip to Washington for an annual meeting of the Federalist Society, a conservative legal group whose confabs he\u2019d been attending since his first year at Harvard Law. Only now he was job hunting. He was about to turn 40, and he was at a professional crossroads. He\u2019d been out of government for two years and was looking for a way back in, this time via election. The only real opening in Texas, though, was a U.S. Senate seat\u2014an impossible reach for Cruz, who\u2019d never even held elected office.\n\nBut at the meeting, he met someone who had pulled off that exact feat: Utah senator-elect Mike Lee. Like Cruz, Lee had been a creature of the conservative legal movement, having clerked for Samuel Alito on the Supreme Court. Like Cruz, he had left Washington to become a government lawyer back home. And like Cruz, he had never before run for office. But he rode the Tea Party wave of 2010 into the Senate, ousting an incumbent Republican by running to his right. After the Federalist Society meeting, Lee and Cruz took a long walk around the Capitol. \"We talked about every conceivable political and constitutional issue,\" Lee recalls. \"I concluded we were kindred spirits.\"\n\nCruz launched his insurgent Senate campaign the following January, zeroing in on the GOP front-runner, David Dewhurst, who as Texas lieutenant governor had the party and business establishments lined up behind him. In classic Tea Party fashion, Cruz went after him from the right. In fact, his highfalutin legal career served as the centerpiece of his grassroots campaign, as he took his esoteric Supreme Court victories, from Medell\u00edn to his successful defense of a Ten Commandments statue on the grounds of the Texas State Capitol, and recast them as conservative crusades. \"He made the solicitor general\u2019s job sound like a combination of Rocky and Rambo,\" marvels the Texas GOP consultant Matt Mackowiak. With an influx of cash from national conservative groups and rousing speeches to whip up the grass roots, Cruz came out of nowhere to force a primary runoff with Dewhurst. He then trounced Dewhurst by fourteen points and cruised past his token Democratic opponent in the general election.\n\n\"I cannot tell you,\" Cruz says now, \"how many little old ladies clasped my shoulder and said, \u2019Ted, please don\u2019t go to Washington and become one of them.\u2019 \"\n\nThe little old ladies of Texas ought to be doing cartwheels. Instead of becoming one of them, Cruz has scorched almost all of them. He\u2019s reserved his most scathing criticism for his fellow Senate Republicans\u2014branding those who\u2019ve had the temerity to stake out not-far-right-enough positions as \"squishes\" and the \"surrender caucus.\" I asked one of Cruz\u2019s colleagues, Iowa Republican Chuck Grassley, if he could recall a freshman behaving as brashly as Cruz. Grassley has been in the Senate for thirty-three years. He was stumped. \"Not somebody I\u2019ve served with,\" he said finally. \"I think Barry Goldwater\u2014reading the history of Barry Goldwater, he made those sorts of impressions right away.\"\n\nIt\u2019s unclear exactly how many wacko birds are in the Senate right at this moment, but by Cruz\u2019s count there are at least three\u2014Rand Paul, Lee, and himself. And three, he says, is a lot. \"I do think the impact of a handful of principled leaders who are fearless in the Senate is significant, and I think it\u2019s significant even going from two to three. If you have three, you pretty quickly get to five or six. Five or six is over 10 percent of the Republican conference, and that\u2019s enough to move a conference and move the Senate.\"\n\nPerfect example, to hear Cruz tell it: gun-control legislation. After the Newtown school shootings, \"the conventional wisdom in Washington was that [it] was unstoppable, that it was going to get sixty-five, sixty-eight votes, that it was a done deal,\" he says. In Cruz\u2019s narrative, the turning point came when he, Lee, and Paul vowed to filibuster any legislation. The threat failed, but Cruz insists that was never the point: \"What we were able to do is, number one, slow things down and, number two, shine a spotlight on them and give time for the grass roots to get engaged.\"\n\nNot everyone agrees with this interpretation of the events. \"Cruz is the rooster taking credit for the sunrise,\" says Jim Kessler of the think tank Third Way, which lobbied for the bill. \"There was never a point in time where we could identify sixty yes votes.\" Cruz\u2019s view is also disputed by many Senate Republicans, who believed (correctly, as it turned out) that gun-control legislation would ultimately fail at the hands of skittish red-state Democrats. Cruz\u2019s blustering, these Republicans argued, was actually counterproductive, since it risked shifting the blame for the defeat of a broadly popular bill away from those Democrats and onto obstructionist Republicans.\n\nAll that bluster, though, has definitely had an impact in other ways. Some Republicans are so spooked about drawing a conservative primary challenger in next year\u2019s midterms\u2014or, as it\u2019s now called in Texas circles, \"being Ted Cruzed\"\u2014that they\u2019ve moved even farther to the right, paralyzing the Senate\u2019s GOP leadership. Exhibit A: John Cornyn, Cruz\u2019s fellow senator from Texas. \"He has Cornyn just frozen on everything,\" one senior Senate Republican aide grumbled to me. \"A member of our leadership just kind of takes his marching orders from this guy who\u2019s been here for a day!\"\n\nThat may be a problem for Republicans, but not necessarily for Cruz. \"We\u2019re in a moment when the combination of being hard-core and intelligent is really at a premium,\" says National Review writer Ramesh Ponnuru, who\u2019s been friends with Cruz since they went to Princeton together. \"Because the two things that conservatives are tired of are politicians who sell out and politicians who embarrass them by not being able to make an account of themselves.\" In this arithmetic, Mitt Romney is the sellout and Sarah Palin is the embarrassment\u2014and Cruz is the great new hope who brings the virtues of both without the liabilities of either.\n\nAnd yet when it comes to policy, the man hailed as the \"Tea Party intellectual\" has deployed that powerful intellect only sparingly since arriving in Washington. Cruz\u2019s most ambitious proposal to date has been his call to abolish the IRS\u2014something that, as one Cruz admirer lamented to me, \"he\u2019s smart enough to know is an entirely cynical thing to do.\" Meanwhile, his effort to shut down the federal government (remember how well that worked out for the GOP the last time they tried it?) unless Obamacare is defunded prompted North Carolina Republican senator Richard Burr to call it \"the dumbest idea I\u2019ve ever heard.\" In multiple conversations with people who know Cruz well, I kept hearing the same refrain: \"He\u2019s smart enough to know better.\"\n\nThen again, maybe Cruz does know better. For a party in the midst of some serious soul-searching, Cruz offers a simple, reassuring solution: Forget the blather about demographic tidal waves and pleas for modernization; all Republicans need to do is return to their small-government, anti-tax fundamentals. \"I don\u2019t know a conservative who didn\u2019t feel embarrassed voting in 2006 or 2008,\" Cruz told me\u2014a remark that\u2019s sure to endear him even more to McCain. \"I think the Republican Party lost its way. We didn\u2019t stand for the principles we\u2019re supposed to believe in.\"\n\nShould he run for president, in 2016 or beyond, Cruz\u2019s strategy will be to superglue himself to the conservative base and hope it carries him to the GOP nomination. It\u2019s been tried over and over since Reagan\u2014and it has failed every time. Just not enough wacko birds out there. Then again, the men who have tried it\u2014from Pat Robertson in 1988 to Rick Santorum in 2012\u2014possessed nowhere near Cruz\u2019s political acumen, not to mention his life story. Or, to put it the way Cruz himself might: None of them were Ted Cruz.\n\nOne Thursday evening in July, Cruz and Rand Paul\u2014ideological kissing cousins already sizing each other up as 2016 rivals\u2014caught the same flight from Washington to Des Moines for the Iowa Renewal Project, a summit for conservative Christian pastors held at the downtown Marriott. It was nearly two and a half years before the state\u2019s presidential caucuses.\n\nIn his speech to the pastors the following Friday, Paul evoked Billy Graham: \"America needs to revive the hope that springs eternal from the transcendent teachings of a humble carpenter who died on a cross.\" Cruz cited the book of Isaiah, Edmund Burke, and the prophet Ezekiel, and he regaled the pastors with tales of his Supreme Court battles, casting them in religious terms. Paul had arrived in Iowa with the bigger profile, but Cruz made the bigger splash. Countless pastors came up to him and laid their hands on his shoulders in a prayerful gesture. \"Remember when the devils tried to take the Ten Commandments out of the State Capitol there?\" I overheard one pastor breathlessly relay into his cell phone. \"That was his case, so he\u2019s really a fighter. He\u2019s a righteous man.\"\n\nLater in the afternoon, Cruz stopped by the Iowa Republican Party\u2019s annual summer picnic, where for $100 a head, about fifty GOP activists squeezed into a small brick building to eat barbecue and hear the Texas senator\u2019s pitch. But Cruz also drew another, less friendly crowd. Outside, a pack of immigration protestors had gathered on the front steps, and while he spoke, they banged on the door and chanted through bullhorns, \"Ted, Ted, come on out, see what Iowa\u2019s all about!\" At one point in his speech, Cruz got a laugh by acknowledging the ruckus: \"We obviously have some friends outside who have different views from those of us in here.\"\n\nAnd with that, Cruz launched into one of his humble-bragging stories\u2014about the time he had \"the curious opportunity\" to give the commencement address to the University of California Berkeley\u2019s political- science department. \"It so happened that that attracted protesters,\" he said, not trying to hide a smug grin. \"They were very, very upset that I had defended the Ten Commandments in Texas, and the Pledge of Allegiance.\" He paused, letting the virtue of his stand sink in with his audience. Then he went on: \"And my wife Heidi\u2019s comment upon hearing them, as she looked at me and she said, \u2019You know, you\u2019re not nearly important enough to protest.\u2019 \"\n\nJason Zengerle (@zengerle) is GQ contributing editor.", "article_metadata": {"description": "D.C.
