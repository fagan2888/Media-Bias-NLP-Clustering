The chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee inadvertently agreed with arguments by Republicans that President Barack Obama isn't doing his job properly."I'm going to go to the House floor and actually debate why we shouldn't be voting for the first time in American history to sue the president of the United States for doing his job, and doing his job actually less often and at a rate that is lower than any other president since Grover Cleveland," said Florida Democratic Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz on MSNBC Wednesday, the Daily Caller reported Wasserman Schultz was criticizing the GOP's measure to sue the president for executive overreach and added that it's the Republicans that "refuse to do anything."Her comments could be explained by a recent analysis by The Washington Post and The Brookings Institution which found that Obama had used executive action less often than any president since Grover Cleveland, who held two non-consecutive terms in office during the late 19th century.Despite the statistics, however, Obama has triggered Republican ire by taking executive action on major political issues, which the GOP says exceeds his constitutional authority.The implementation of Obamacare is at the top of their list, as is his decision to grant amnesty to nearly 600,000 illegal immigrants through the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals executive action policy.On Wednesday, the House voted 225-201 to sue Obama. The lawsuit will focus on Obama's unilateral decision to delay for one year Obamacare's employer insurance mandate, the Daily Caller reported.
