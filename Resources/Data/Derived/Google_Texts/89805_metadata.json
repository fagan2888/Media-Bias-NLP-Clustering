Just getting a little bit of the rust off. There\u2019s only so much you can do in the offseason,\u201d sid Skille, who played two years at the University of Wisconsin before turning pro. \u201cThose first two practices are always really hard. But I like the practices so far and I\u2019m ready to play some games.\u201d\n\nSkille, 28, is 6-foot-1 and 215 pounds. He was Chicago\u2019s first-round selection (seventh overall) in 2005. He played for the Blackhawks, Florida Panthers and Columbus Blue Jackets, but was unable to find a guaranteed contract in the off-season. Skille had six goals and eight points in 45 games for Columbus last season.\n\nHe is among a dozen or so NHL veterans on PTO contracts throughout the league during training camp. Among the others are former Avs defenseman Jan Hejda, who is trying out for the Blackhawks.\n\n\u201cI think the younger players coming up are closer to being ready sooner,\u201d Skille said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know. I really don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve been confused about it myself the last couple years, especially. But in the situation I\u2019m in right now I can\u2019t really think about that stuff. I\u2019ve just decided that these are the cards I\u2019ve been given and I have to deal with them and power through them. I just have to work hard and get it done.\u201d\n\nAndrej Meszaros is also on a PTO with the Avalanche. The 29-year-old defenseman made $4.125 million with the Buffalo Sabres last season. Meszaros does not look as good as Skille. In fact, Meszaros was a distant last in his group during every practice-ending conditioning session.\n\nGabe Landeskog did not participate in conditioning drill.\n\nAvs captain Gabe Landeskog did not participate in the conditioning drill, saying it was just a precaution. The left wing said he plans on playing in Sunday\u2019s Burgundy/White scrimmage at the University of Denver (1 p.m.). Landeskog has skated on a line with center Carl Soderberg in the two-day training camp. Both are from Sweden.\n\nIn the second session, Borna Rendulic was struck in the face by a stick or puck and returned to the ice in a full face cage.\n\nMike Chambers: mchambers@denverpost.com or twitter.com/mikechambers", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Jack Skille impresses at Avalanche training camp", "title": "Jack Skille impresses at Avalanche training camp", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/09/19/jack-skille-impresses-at-avalanche-training-camp/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150919__jack-skille-colorado-avalanche-DPp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150919__jack-skille-colorado-avalanche-DPp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-19T12:40:06+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T17:50:37+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Veterans kicked off the Avalanche\u2019s three-session training camp Saturday, and Jack Skille \u2014 who is on a professional tryout contract \u2014 was among the most impressive.\nHe is among a dozen or so NHL veterans on PTO contracts throughout the league during training camp.\nLandeskog has skated on a line with center Carl Soderberg in the two-day training camp.\nSkille played right wing on a line with center Nathan MacKinnon and Alex Tanguay, and used his size and speed to generate multiple offensive opportunities.\nThere\u2019s only so much you can do in the offseason,\u201d sid Skille, who played two years at the University of Wisconsin before turning pro."}
