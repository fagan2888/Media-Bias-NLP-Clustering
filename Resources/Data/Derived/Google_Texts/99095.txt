NBC Nightly News editor and anchor Brian Williams could be the next Sir Mix-A-Lot, at least according to Jimmy Fallon.

The comedian opened “The Tonight Show” Monday with a mash-up of news segment clips of Brian Williams that all add up to his “interpretation” of the 1992 hit “Baby Got Back.” The edited short proves that Fallon can not only make people laugh, but he can actually put words (or more accurately, verses) in people’s mouths.

In the edited short, Williams discusses the Iran nuclear deal, same-sex marriage, Netflix, Oreos and Kim Jong-un all while the tune flows perfectly from his mouth. The video even features a special female guest to sing the “me so horny” line.

This isn’t the first time that Williams has showcased his vocal talents on “The Tonight Show.” Back in April, Fallon had him rapping Snoop Dogg’s “Gin and Juice.”
