Now, with its release online at the same time it debuts in theaters, it has a new role: a test for a new kind of movie release.\n\n\u201cThe Interview\u201d stars Seth Rogen and James Franco as journalists tasked by the CIA with killing North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Its Christmas Day release was canceled by Sony after threats of violence by hackers linked to North Korea. But after an outcry, the release was reinstated in some independent theaters and now, through a few online video services.\n\nAlthough the circumstances surrounding \u201cThe Interview\u201d are unprecedented, experts say the release will be closely watched to see how moviegoers and theater chains react to a simultaneous debut. It\u2019s a challenge to the longstanding practice of \u201cwindowing\u201d \u2014 opening a movie first in theaters to maximize box-office revenue before making the movie available in other stages of home video, streaming and television.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t say that this is the future,\u201d said Jeff Bock, senior box office analyst for Exhibitor Relations Co. \u201cFor this film, in particular, it works because of the saga that goes along with it. But it\u2019s nice to have a film we can actually use as a guinea pig for a video-on-demand release.\u201d\n\nSony released \u201cThe Interview\u201d Wednesday on a variety of digital platforms - Google Play, YouTube Movies, Microsoft\u2019s Xbox Video and a separate Sony website. It costs $5.99 to rent for 48 hours and $14.99 to purchase. It also will open in more than 300 smaller theaters on Thursday, though major chains are still holding out.\n\nCarrying \u201cThe Interview\u201d marks another step in Google\u2019s efforts to establish YouTube as an entertainment hub that features major movies and trendy musical videos - not just cute clips of kitties. Google, though, primarily is providing outlets for the movie because it considers itself to be a guardian of free speech.\n\nDecisions by Google and Microsoft to show the movie could open their sites to hacking. Microsoft reported technical problems with its Xbox sign-in system Wednesday, though it wasn\u2019t known whether it was the result of hacking. Microsoft services appeared back to normal by Wednesday night. Microsoft declined comment.\n\nOnline availability of \u201cThe Interview\u201d comes as more people are choosing to stream video online, largely because of YouTube, Hulu and Netflix, which has been phasing out its original DVD-by-mail business over the past four years. During that time, the number of Netflix subscribers in the U.S. has nearly doubled to about 40 million in a reflection of Internet video\u2019s growing popularity.\n\nNonetheless, releasing a major motion picture in theaters and online simultaneously - known as a \u201cday-and-date\u201d release - has never been done by a major studio with a mainstream movie like \u201cThe Interview.\u201d It\u2019s been limited to some smaller indie and foreign movies. The upcoming \u201cCrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\u201d sequel will be released on Netflix and Imax theaters on the same day, but that isn\u2019t a studio production, despite the involvement of the Weinstein Co.\n\nTheater chains have been trying to preserve the traditional theatrical window. Regal Cinemas and Cinemark, for example, declined to screen Warner Bros.\u2019 day-and-date release \u201cVeronica Mars\u201d earlier this year. Warner Bros. instead rented from AMC Theaters most of the 270 screens the movie played in while it was also released on VOD.\n\nThis time, however, the four major theater chains can\u2019t really object, analysts said, as they all declined to show \u201cThe Interview,\u201d leaving Sony little choice.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t being done because Sony wants to do it regularly, but rather out of necessity prompted by the exhibitor boycott,\u201d Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter said. \u201cThe only guys showing it are independent chains.\u201d\n\nWith a modest budget of about $40 million, \u201cThe Interview\u201d had been predicted to gross about $30 million in its opening weekend. Bock estimates Sony could gross just a fraction of that - $3 million to $4 million - at this box office this weekend. As for streaming, Bock said the $5.99 price for rental is much lower than regular theater tickets, and that could drive demand. But Sony isn\u2019t likely to make up all of its costs, including the tens of millions in marketing costs already incurred.\n\nA best-case scenario for a video-on-demand release is the thriller \u201cSnowpiercer,\u201d which debuted on video on demand about two weeks after its theatrical release. It made nearly $11 million on VOD, more than double its theatrical revenue, and is considered one of the most successful VOD releases so far.\n\nIf \u201cThe Interview\u201d agreement is similar to other digital video deals, Google and Microsoft will get a 30 percent commission on all rentals and purchases of the movies made through their services. Yet even if the movie were to be wildly successful and generate $100 million in video-on-demand revenue, that would leave about $30 million for Google and Microsoft to divide - hardly anything for two of the world\u2019s most profitable companies. For instance, Google is expected to bring in revenue of about $66 billion this year, or about $30 million every four hours.\n\nBy including \u201cThe Interview\u201d in their libraries, both YouTube and Microsoft\u2019s Xbox can also make more people aware they rent and sell a wide range of videos. Although YouTube began renting movies nearly five years ago, many people think of the site as a destination for free clips lasting for a few minutes instead of place to watch full-length films.\n\nGitesh Pandya, editor of Box Office Guru, said all the media attention should lead to \u201cstrong averages from the limited theatrical release plus solid video-on-demand sales\u201d over the holidays, but he expects demand to fade in January because of the quality of the movie.\n\n\u201cIt is great that a freedom of speech debate is happening for Hollywood films,\u201d he said. \u201cI just wish it was centered around a better movie,\u201d he said.\n\n___\n\nAP Technology Writer Michael Liedtke in San Francisco and Film Writer Lindsey Bahr in Los Angeles contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sony's \"The Interview\" has been a hacking target, a punchline and a political lightning rod.
