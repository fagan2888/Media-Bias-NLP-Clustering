It\u2019s an intuitively pleasing result, Sperling admitted, because basic economics says that as the price of something increases, demand for it will fall.\n\nHowever, he added, \u201cThe best economic research is not the research that puts in an automatic elasticity,\u201d said Sperling, \u201cIt\u2019s what looks at actual human behavior.\u201d\n\nAs it turns out, numerous studies looking at \u201cnatural experiments\u201d in minimum wage increases \u2013 meaning actual events rather than academic models \u2013 find that moderate increases have \u201cno discernible effect\u201d on employment.\n\nRelated: CBO \u2013 Minimum Wage Hike Would Cost 500,000 Jobs\n\nThe first evidence that this might be the case arose in 1994, when economists David Card and Alan Krueger published a paper studying employment at fast food restaurants in neighboring parts of Pennsylvania and New Jersey after New Jersey raised its minimum wage and Pennsylvania kept its wage steady. The economists surveyed hundreds of restaurants on both sides of the border, and determined that the wage hike in New Jersey had no measurable effect on employment.\n\nSince then, according to Doug Hall, director of the Economic Analysis and Research Network at the Economic Policy Institute, other economists have done similar studies at the state and county level when a minimum wage change makes labor more expensive in one jurisdiction than in a neighboring one.\n\nThe chart above shows the results of more than 1,400 different studies. The x-axis shows the size of the employment effect, and the y-axis shows that statistical power of the analysis.\n\nThe results have clustered around the finding that a moderate wage increase \u2013 in line with the administration\u2019s proposal to increase the minimum rate in 95-cent increments \u2013 has zero effect on total employment. And the higher a study\u2019s statistical power, the more likely it is to fall on the line showing zero effect.\n\n\u201cI really think that\u2019s a very compelling takeaway,\u201d said Hall, who has testified before multiple state legislatures on the issue. \u201cIt puts the lie to the notion that it\u2019s going to be a tremendous job killer.\u201d\n\nRelated: White House Attacks CBO Over Minimum Wage Report\n\nRegardless of any academic consensus, it still appears highly unlikely that the administration will be able to push a minimum wage increase through Congress, as Republicans in control of the House of Representatives, have united behind the CBO finding that such a move would cost jobs.\n\nA recent editorial in the conservative National Review had this takeaway from the CBO finding:\n\n\u201cThe logical extension of this insight is not to lower the minimum wage, but to abolish it. The federal minimum wage is merely a statutory floor; the real minimum wage, which already is collected by our millions upon millions of unemployed and will be collected by a half-million more should the Democrats get their way, is $0.00. That\u2019s what unemployment pays.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The director of President Obama\u2019s National Economic Council on yesterday continued the", "title": "1,400 Real World Minimum Wage Increases Show No Impact on Employment", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/02/21/1400-Real-World-Minimum-Wage-Increases-Show-No-Impact-Employment", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/09172013_Striking_Fast_Food_Workers.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/02/21/1400-Real-World-Minimum-Wage-Increases-Show-No-Impact-Employment", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/09172013_Striking_Fast_Food_Workers.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The director of President Obama\u2019s National Economic Council on yesterday continued the", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9850\"", "article_summary": "The federal minimum wage is merely a statutory floor; the real minimum wage, which already is collected by our millions upon millions of unemployed and will be collected by a half-million more should the Democrats get their way, is $0.00.\nThe x-axis shows the size of the employment effect, and the y-axis shows that statistical power of the analysis.\nThe results have clustered around the finding that a moderate wage increase \u2013 in line with the administration\u2019s proposal to increase the minimum rate in 95-cent increments \u2013 has zero effect on total employment.\nRelated: CBO Finds Minimum Wage Research \u201cBiased\u201dThe primary argument between the two sides is over what economists refer to as the \u201celasticity\u201d of the employment rate in the face of changes to the minimum wage \u2013 that is, how sensitive the employment rate is to changes in the wages of the very lowest-paid workers.\nThe CBO studied the literature and, based on various studies done by economists in the past few decades, determined that the employment rate is moderately responsive to the wage rate."}
