Jesse Ventura, who has been toying with a White House run himself, is convinced that Americans should not have to pay taxes during the federal government shutdown.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s my big question. Since the government shut down, now let\u2019s keep track of the number of days we shouldn\u2019t have to pay taxes then, should we?\u201d Mr. Ventura tells Larry King \u2014 now host of \u201cPoliticking with Larry King\u201d on RT, the Russian-based news channel \u2014 in a broadcast airing on Thursday night.\n\n\u201cGood idea, Jesse,\u201d the ever-amendable Mr. King replies in the segment.\n\n\u201cIf they shut the government down, we should lose our tax obligation because what are we paying for then?\u201d Mr. Ventura declares. The former pro-wrestler also offers insight about his own presidential campaign.\n\n\u201cIf I run, I will offer the people of the United States the first opportunity to elect a president who does not belong to a political party since George Washington. He is our only president who did not belong to a political party at all, and this will give the American people the opportunity to make history again,\u201d Mr. Ventura adds.\n\n\u201cAnd we used to have multiple parties; we had the Whig, the Federalist,\u201d Mr. King began.\n\n\u201cWhy have any parties? They\u2019re nothing but gangs. That\u2019s all they are. I don\u2019t belong to any of them. Elect a president that belongs to no political party. And I believe, Larry, that you could win off that alone,\u201d Mr. Ventura said.\n\nD.C. DYSFUNCTION\n\nYes, it is this bad: \u201cThirty-three percent of Americans cite dissatisfaction with government and elected representatives as the nation\u2019s top issue, the highest such percentage in Gallup\u2019s trend dating back to 1939,\u201d reports Gallup director Frank Newport, upon analyzing the findings.\n\n\u201cDysfunctional government now eclipses the economy (19 percent), unemployment (12 percent), the deficit (12 percent) and health care (12 percent) as the nation\u2019s top problem.\n\nSAY AMEN SOMEBODY\n\n\u201cLord, when our federal shutdown delays payments of death benefits to the families of children dying on faraway battlefields, it\u2019s time for our lawmakers to say, \u2018Enough is enough.\u2019 Cover our shame with the robe of your righteousness. Forgive us, reform us and make us whole. Amen.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Prayer before the U.S. Senate by Chaplain Barry Black on Wednesday.\n\nMr. Black \u2014 who is a retired rear admiral, former Navy chaplain and a Seventh-day Adventist minister \u2014 prays each day for the Senate and the nation. His words are now tracked by several news organizations. He intends to be nonpartisan and nonsectarian, but not apolitical.\n\n\u201cPrayer can be so otherworldly that it is of no earthly good. If I am truly a pastor, I think there is going to be a political element to my prayer, and hopefully not a partisan element,\u201d the pastor told the New York Daily News.\n\nOBAMACARE BOTCHAPHOBIA\n\nThe Affordable Care Act is mired in operational woes and the huge chore of implementation \u2014 a phenomenon that has been predicted for months.\n\n\u201cBack in March, at an insurance industry conference in Washington, the problems were apparent. Henry Chao, chief information officer at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, openly fretted that the exchanges wouldn\u2019t be ready by October,\u201d recalls Avik Roy, a contributor to Forbes.\n\nWhat did Mr. Choo tell the crowd about the big launch?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty nervous. I don\u2019t know about you. Let\u2019s just make sure it\u2019s not a Third World experience,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAt the time, Chao\u2019s comment seemed like an attempt at dark humor. One week into the launch of Obamacare, however, it\u2019s not a joke. It\u2019s literally easier to blog from the Kenyan border than to sign up for insurance on Obamacare\u2019s federal exchange,\u201d Mr. Roy says. \u201cWhy is this happening? Politics. The Obama administration was more afraid of delaying the launch of Obamacare, than they were of botching it.\u201d\n\nPresident Obama even appears leery of the site. White House spokesman Jay Carney was unable to confirm or deny Wednesday whether his boss had gone online to the official \u201cHealthcare Marketplace\u201d for a test run.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know he\u2019s personally gone on the website,\u201d Mr. Carney said during the daily press briefing.\n\nTHE DOCTOR IS IN\n\nFox News continues to up the ante. Yes, they\u2019ve overhauled their prime-time scheduling and created a pair of new programs. Now comes the addition of columnist, author and humanitarian Dr. Ben Carson as a contributor; he debuted on the network\u2019s new \u201cThe Kelly File\u201d on Wednesday evening.\n\n\u201cDr. Carson is a brilliant neurosurgeon who has dedicated his life to healing others. He also has a broad perspective on what\u2019s going on in the country and his wisdom and provocative viewpoints will make a major contribution to our network,\u201d says Fox News CEO Roger Ailes.\n\nThe physician\u2019s frank and common-sense observations about politics and Obamacare have won him many fans; numerous \u201cBen Carson for President\u201d interest groups and websites have sprung up in the past 10 months.\n\nJohn Philip Sousa IV, the great-grandson of the famous composer, launched the super PAC \u201cNational Draft Ben Carson for President Committee\u201d in August, and it is now registered with the Federal Election Commission, complete with website RunBenRun.org.\n\nQUANTITATIVE UNEASINESS\n\nWill the public ponder terms like quantitative easing \u2014 or QE \u2014 now that Janet Yellen has been selected by President Obama to lead the Fed? Could be. She is said to be a \u201cdove\u201d in love with QE, more concerned with alleviating unemployment than holding the line on inflation, some observers say.\n\n\u201cJanet Yellen is the minimum-controversy, status quo choice most likely to leave the Fed on autopilot as it pursues its course of fiat currency destruction. It\u2019s a testament to the nature of our times that both leftists and Wall Street prefer not to have a Fed chief dedicated first and foremost to preserving the value of the dollar,\u201d points out Bill Frezza, a technology and entrepreneurship fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute.\n\n\u201cThis implies that the devastating impact of QE money printing and Zero Interest Rate Policy on savers, investors and pension funds will continue until the inevitable double-digit inflation becomes so severe even the Bureau of Economic Analysis can\u2019t hide it with its massaged figures,\u201d Mr. Frezza adds. \u201cPutting off the day of reckoning is always the first choice of our dysfunctional political system, which will only make the eventual crisis even worse.\u201d\n\nPOLL DU JOUR\n\n\u2022 47 percent of Americans say that it is \u201cabsolutely essential\u201d that the federal debt limit be raised to avoid economic crisis.\n\n\u2022 39 percent say the nation can go past the deadline without major economic problems.\n\n\u2022 43 percent of Americans say that to lower the federal debt, two-thirds of the money should come from spending cuts, and one-third from tax increases.\n\n\u2022 31 percent would like half to come from spending cuts, half from tax increases.\n\n\u2022 35 percent fear that reducing the deficit would cut too much from Medicare and Social Security.\n\n\u2022 25 percent are concerned it would raise their taxes.\n\n\u2022 17 percent are concerned that a deficit agreement will not meet its target.\n\n\u2022 14 percent are concerned it will allow for too much federal spending.\n\nSource: A National Journal survey of 1,000 U.S. adults conducted Oct. 3 to 6.\n\n\u2022 Uneasy commentary, snappy quips to jharper@washingtontimes.com.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Former Minnesota Gov.
