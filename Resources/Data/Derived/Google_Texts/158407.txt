Former Rep. Ron Paul is has relaunched his petition at Voices of Liberty urging clemency for NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden. Paul writes:

Mr. Snowden made headlines in late spring 2013 when he revealed in a videotaped interview with investigative journalists Glenn Greenwald and Laura Poitras that our federal government has been operating a massive spying program.

The revelations have and continue to open our minds to the truth and power of our government. We are being watched and recorded. And we don’t have to do anything wrong; individuals can be falsely attacked to derive suspicion.

Reflecting on Mr. Snowden’s sacrifices — his livelihood, citizenship and freedom — made to provide us with the disturbing scope of the National Security Agency (NSA) mass surveillance and data collection efforts, we at Voices of Liberty want to thank him for being a voice for freedom, liberty and truth.
