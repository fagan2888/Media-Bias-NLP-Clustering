The call will include technology and antitrust experts to argue against the merger.\n\nComcast downplayed the group\u2019s formation, saying it is composed of an existing band of opponents who are making \"refuted\" arguments.\n\n\u201cThe real facts remain the same: consumers don\u2019t lose choice in the broadband or video markets,\u201d according to a statement from the company. \u201cConsumers will see real benefits in faster broadband speeds and better video products, and a host of other benefits. And there are no transaction-specific harms to this merger.\u201d\n\nAll three groups have previously come out against the proposed merger and have called on the Federal Communications Commission and the Justice Department to deny the application.\n\nThe deal to merge the two largest U.S. cable companies must be approved by both government agencies before it can be finalized. Regulators must determine the deal is in the public interest and does not harm competition.\n\nThe FCC is 126 days into its informal 180-day review period.\n\n\u2014 Updated at 6:28 p.m.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The new group is made up of Comptel, NTCA-The Rural Broadband Association, and the Independent Telephone and Telecommunications Alliance.", "description": "The new group is made up of Comptel, NTCA-The Rural Broadband Association, and the Independent Telephone and Telecommunications Alliance.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Mario Trujillo", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The new group is made up of Comptel, NTCA-The Rural Broadband Association, and the Independent Telephone and Telecommunications Alliance.", "title": "Comptel, others launch campaign against Comcast merger", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/231450-comptel-others-launch-campaign-against-comcast-merger", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T03:59:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T03:59-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/231450-comptel-others-launch-campaign-against-comcast-merger", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2015-02-02T12:26-05:00", "dcterms.creator": "Mario Trujillo", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"published_time": "2015-02-02T12:26:36-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T03:59:59-05:00"}, "keywords": "Time Warner Cable, Comcast, merger,,", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/231450-comptel-others-launch-campaign-against-comcast-merger", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The new group is made up of Comptel, NTCA-The Rural Broadband Association, and the Independent Telephone and Telecommunications Alliance.", "card": "summary", "title": "Comptel, others launch campaign against Comcast merger"}, "dcterms.title": "Comptel, others launch campaign against Comcast merger"}, "article_summary": "Comptel, NTCA-The Rural Broadband Association, and the Independent Telephone and Telecommunications Alliance are launching the \u201cDon\u2019t Comcast the Internet\u201d campaign on Monday.\nThe groups are arguing the proposed $45 billion merger would seriously harm competition and innovation in the market.\nA group of trade organizations are teaming up to lobby against the proposed Comcast-Time Warner Cable merger.\nComcast downplayed the group\u2019s formation, saying it is composed of an existing band of opponents who are making \"refuted\" arguments.\n\u201cConsumers will see real benefits in faster broadband speeds and better video products, and a host of other benefits."}
