Remember in 2013 when internet racists threw a full-blown freak-out over Cheerios’ featuring an interracial family in one of its ads?

Well, Cheerios is rightly not backing down — in fact, the cereal company made a point of including the same family in their ad for this year’s Super Bowl, no small gesture when you consider just how expensive and coveted a Super Bowl ad spot can be.

It’s getting a great response on Twitter, too:

The little girl in the @cheerios ad? Absolutely ADORABLE!! #cheerios #superbowlads — Erica Stone Gilbert (@resplendentlyme) February 3, 2014

As a soon to be #daddy, I really like the #Cheerios commercial. If I have a little girl I could totally see myself giving her a puppy. — Joe Petri (@JoeyPetri) February 3, 2014
