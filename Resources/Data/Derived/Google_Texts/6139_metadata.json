However, he also voiced words of caution for Republicans on the heels of their big election night victory.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid that Republican leaders, like Mitch McConnell in the Senate and John Boehner and Kevin McCarthy in the House, I\u2019m afraid they did not hear the Republican voters,\u201d Viguerie said.\n\nThe conservative activist said he didn\u2019t hear party leaders on election night talk about the issues that conservative voters care most about, such as illegal immigration, Obamacare, major tax and spending cuts, and curbing Obama\u2019s abuses of power. He believes there also will be turmoil if Republicans ignore the wishes of their own voters.\n\n\u201cIf the Republican leaders conduct themselves in such a way that they\u2019re going to ignore the voters, they will hear loud and clear from the voters, and that fault line will be visible to the whole country. It\u2019ll make it very difficult for Republicans to govern effectively in the Congress,\u201d Viguerie said.\n\nLine up your copy of \u201cTakeover\u201d now, and find out what Richard Viguerie believes is a winning formula for conservatives, and the U.S., at a special price right now!\n\nViguerie wrote about the fault line between conservatives and establishment Republicans in his 2014 book \u201cTakeover: The 100-Year War for the Soul of the GOP and How Conservatives Can Finally Win It.\u201d\n\nHe believes the most important political battle in America today is actually inside the GOP.\n\n\u201cFor most of the past 102 years, while this civil war\u2019s been going on, conservatives have had their political guns pointed at the wrong target,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been focused on the Democrats when, actually, our main opponent is inside the Republican Party, the big-government Republicans, and that\u2019s coming to a head in the next couple of years.\u201d\n\nViguerie said he is discouraged that so many establishment Republicans abandon conservative Republicans in their time of need. This year in Kansas, for example, the establishment abandoned Gov. Sam Brownback when he was locked in a tight reelection race. Likewise, the national GOP establishment abandoned Ken Cuccinelli in his 2013 Virginia gubernatorial race when a little more support may have pushed him over the top.\n\n\u201cConservatives are staying in the Republican Party and supporting the Republican candidates,\u201d Viguerie said. \u201cWe are not seeing that with a lot of the big-government Republicans.\u201d\n\nAs for the Democrats, Viguerie believes they are alienating white working class voters by supporting amnesty for illegal immigrants, attacking religious freedoms, and attacking gun rights.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that the Democratic Party, the Democratic leaders at the national and state level are being seen more and more as being either hostile to working middle-class Americans, or not engaged in their problems,\u201d he said. \u201cThe working class, traditional-value voters are feeling that they\u2019re just not welcome in the Democratic Party. It\u2019s become more of an elite special interest party.\u201d\n\nEven though 2016 looks to be a tougher year in the Senate for Republicans, Viguerie is confident the party can build on this year\u2019s midterm victories \u2013 but only if Republicans run as conservatives, not watered-down Democrats.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m optimistic that if the Republicans continue to draw a bright-line distinction between their vision of the future and the Democrats\u2019 vision of the future, we can build on this,\u201d he said.\n\nLine up your copy of \u201cTakeover\u201d now, and find out what Richard Viguerie believes is a winning formula for conservatives, and the U.S., at a special price right now!", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "Barack Obama\u2019s famous observation about the 2008 election was, \u201cElections have consequences.\u201d But what if national leaders respond to an election by ignoring the will of the voters?
