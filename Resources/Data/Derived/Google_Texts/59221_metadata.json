A longtime lieutenant to both Clintons, Balderston, who called everyone \u201cbuddy,\u201d liked to talk in salesman\u2019s terms about Hillary\u2019s \u201cpower to convene\u201d and her commitment to making sure her partners could \u201cdo well by doing good.\u201d What he meant was that Hillary could use the Clinton Rolodex to focus private-sector money, government power, and the expertise at colleges and nonprofits to solve global problems. At best, they would do a public service and make a buck. At worst, they would make a powerful friend. Balderston became, for lack of a better term, Hillary\u2019s special ops guy at State.\n\nHe wrote Hillary the first memo on his concept for an office that would mirror Bill\u2019s Clinton Global Initiative on December 8, 2008, less than a week after she was named to her job and more than six weeks before she took office. Though she had to wait for some of her lieutenants to clear the Obama vetting process and a Senate confirmation vote, she had made it a priority to empower Balderston, the political fixer who could help her build unique networks connecting her State Department to other government agencies, the nonprofit sector, and the corporate world. While many Democrats believe that government is the answer to the world\u2019s problems, and many Republicans believe the same of the private sector, Balderston\u2019s office was the embodiment of Hillary\u2019s core Clintonian belief that government, business, and charitable organizations are all vital components of a thriving society.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more than raising money,\u201d said one source familiar with the concept. \u201cIt\u2019s networking other people\u2019s intellectual property, networks, lists, that sort of thing. You need somebody who does more than just raise money.\u201d Just like the Clinton Global Initiative.\n\nBut intellectual property and network expansion would have to wait\u2014Hillary needed cash. Balderston was still setting up the office when Hillary approached him at the end of February 2009. \u201cI have the first project for you,\u201d she said. The job: raise more than $60 million from the private sector in nine months. In an era of billion-dollar presidential campaigns, that might not sound like much jack. But the government generally doesn\u2019t raise money from the private sector, in large part because of the potential for corporate donors to give with the expectation that they will get specific government actions in return. Moreover, Congress and the Bush administration had shunned the very initiative Hillary wanted Balderston to execute.\n\nHillary had just returned from China, the anchor stop on her first trip overseas, where she had been surprised to find that the United States didn\u2019t have a plan to build a pavilion at the world\u2019s fair the following year, the Shanghai Expo. Chinese officials were incensed at the insensitivity to a major international showcase event in their country, and they gave Hillary an earful. They had been complaining to American businesses, too. From China\u2019s perspective, America\u2019s failure to build a pavilion would be a little less insulting than a boycott of the Olympics but not much. At the time, Hillary and Obama were touting an American \u201cpivot\u201d toward Asia, a shift of focus away from Europe and the Middle East and toward China, Japan, and their neighbors, as a central part of their foreign policy agenda. The elevation of State through the Strategic & Economic Dialogue was but one example of the new emphasis on building a more comprehensive relationship with China. After all, the world\u2019s two most powerful nations had common interests in issues ranging from the world economy to fighting terrorism. Certainly, snubbing China at the encore to the 2008 Beijing Olympics would complicate those efforts.\n\nSo the expo held outsize symbolic importance in the new partnership Obama wanted to build. \u201cIt became important to [Hillary] because it was made clear to her by the Chinese senior leadership that it was important to them,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Villarreal, a veteran Clinton fundraiser with ties to China. \u201cIt was inconceivable to the Chinese that they could have a world expo and not have the United States there, especially not have the United States [be] virtually the only country that was not going to participate.\u201d\n\nWhile she was in China, Hillary confessed that she hadn\u2019t been briefed on the fair\u2014few politicians fail to blame their staff when necessary\u2014and committed to looking into it when she got home. This impending diplomatic faux pas over the Shanghai Expo would be a serious affront to a country that the United States was in the process of courting. In addition to the downside risk, the expo offered Hillary two opportunities. First, she could draw a sharp contrast with the Bush administration, which had made clear that it wouldn\u2019t use government resources to raise money for a pavilion. \u201cThe Department of State is not now authorized, and does not in the future intend to seek authorization from the U.S. Congress, to provide funding for any aspect of the U.S. exhibition at the World Expo,\u201d the department wrote in a 2006 request-for-proposals for a private entity to try to build a pavilion on America\u2019s behalf. That effort had been going nowhere when the Chinese approached Hillary.\n\nThe U.S. government had soured on the world\u2019s fair idea after a scandal involving the American operation at the 1998 expo in Lisbon, and Congress had subsequently placed a nearly comprehensive ban on the State Department directly funding pavilions at future world\u2019s fairs. But lawmakers had left a loophole for staff to raise money from private donors, corporations, NGOs, and foreign governments. That loophole was just the right size for Balderston and his new shop to fit through. Under federal law and ethics regulations, Hillary could even express her support to potential donors without making a direct appeal for money\u2014a wrinkle in the law that would create great controversy when the secretary of health and human services, Kathleen Sebelius, helped raise private funds to promote Obamacare in 2013.\n\nAs a second bonus, setting up a fund-raising operation for the fair gave Hillary an invaluable early opportunity to strengthen and expand her network among top American business executives, a potential source of campaign contributions if she decided to run in 2016.\n\nBalderston was a political operative but not a fund-raiser per se, and Hillary turned to two longtime Clinton money bundlers, Elizabeth Bagley and Villarreal, to jump-start the capital campaign. Bagley, a former ambassador to Portugal and a million-dollar donor to the Clinton Foundation, was named as Hillary\u2019s special representative for global partnerships, a role that Balderston would later take over. A former adviser to both Clintons and the treasurer of Al Gore\u2019s 2000 campaign, Villareal had been a \u201cHillraiser,\u201d one of her big-time campaign cash bundlers. He was also a former member of the board of directors of Walmart Stores.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sometimes in D.C., the crime is what's legal: Inside the massive Clinton fundraising operation at State", "title": "\u201cThey made it crystal clear that the ask was from Hillary\u201d: Inside the Clinton fundraising machine \u2014 as secretary of state", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Sometimes in D.C., the crime is what's legal: Inside the massive Clinton fundraising operation at State", "title": "\u201cThey made it crystal clear that the ask was from Hillary\u201d: Inside the Clinton fundraising machine \u2014 as secretary of state", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/03/21/they_made_it_crystal_clear_that_the_ask_was_from_hillary_inside_the_clinton_fundraising_machine_as_secretary_of_state/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/hillary_bill_clinton.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Sometimes in D.C., the crime is what's legal: Inside the massive Clinton fundraising operation at State", "title": "\u201cThey made it crystal clear that the ask was from Hillary\u201d: Inside the Clinton fundraising machine \u2014 as secretary of state", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/hillary_bill_clinton.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Bill Clinton, Books, Clinton Foundation, Editor's Picks, fundraising, Hillary Clinton", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe4b3e\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Bill Clinton, Books, Clinton Foundation, Editor's Picks, fundraising, Hillary Clinton, Politics NewsHillary tapped Kris Balderston, the hit list author, to keep the Clinton political network humming at State.\nYou need somebody who does more than just raise money.\u201d Just like the Clinton Global Initiative.\nBut lawmakers had left a loophole for staff to raise money from private donors, corporations, NGOs, and foreign governments.\nFirst, she could draw a sharp contrast with the Bush administration, which had made clear that it wouldn\u2019t use government resources to raise money for a pavilion.\nBalderston was a political operative but not a fund-raiser per se, and Hillary turned to two longtime Clinton money bundlers, Elizabeth Bagley and Villarreal, to jump-start the capital campaign."}
