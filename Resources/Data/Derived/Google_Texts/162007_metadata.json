Mevlut Guvendik, chair of engineering programs at Eastern Florida; and Gary Koser, chair of engineering programs at Indian River.\n\nThe Florida Tech offices of Enrollment Management and Financial Aid, Career Management Services, Academic Support Center and Institutional Research also supported the project.\n\nTransfer students will be selected for the scholarship program based on a number of factors, including grade point average, financial need, memberships in student, organizations and honor societies, faculty recommendations, attendance at Florida Tech\u2019s special campus events, such as Laser Day and Discovery Day, and community service.\n\nThey will also be asked to write an essay highlighting career objectives and interest in STEM fields.\n\nStudents participating in this program will be provided with opportunities to conduct social and professional networking with peers, engage in student club activities, carry out multi-disciplinary, sustainability-related research and design projects, and receive enhanced academic support in advanced courses.\n\nClick here to contribute your news or announcements Free", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "florida tech,homepage,slider", "og": {"image": "http://spacecoastdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/NSF-FLORIDA-TECH-435.jpg"}, "fb": {"admins": 1204082483, "app_id": 644760862318465}, "description": "A Florida Institute of Technology proposal to use scholarships to boost the number of students studying the critical Science, Technology, Engineering and", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Florida Tech partnered with Eastern Florida State College and Indian River State College on the project.\nScience Foundation Funds Florida Tech-led ScholarshipsBy Adam Lowenstein, Florida Tech News Bureau // October 5, 2014National Science Foundation Grant Worth More Than $610,000 Over the Next Five YearsBREVARD COUNTY \u2022 MELBOURNE, FLORIDA \u2013 A Florida Institute of Technology proposal to use scholarships to boost the number of students studying the critical Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics discipline of engineering has received a National Science Foundation grant worth more than $610,000 over the next five years.\nThe Florida Tech offices of Enrollment Management and Financial Aid, Career Management Services, Academic Support Center and Institutional Research also supported the project.\nHe said the project also could help spur a push among community and state college students to enter STEM fields.\nCo-principal investigators are Manolis Tomadakis, professor and head of chemical engineering and John Windsor, professor and associate head of marine and environmental systems, both at Florida Tech;
