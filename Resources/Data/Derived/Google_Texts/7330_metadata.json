Scott Walker said after Obama smacked him for signing a right-to-work bill.\n\nObama, who believes that he should comment on anything and everything under the sun, issued a written statement condemning the law.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m deeply disappointed,\u201d he said, \u201cthat a new anti-worker law in Wisconsin will weaken, rather than strengthen, workers in the new economy.\u201d\n\nObama then claimed that Walker\u2019s action was part of an \u201cinexcusable assault on unions, led by powerful interests and their allies in government.\u201d\n\nClearly Obama needs to take a civics refresher course. After all, the bill that landed on Walker\u2019s desk was the result of the state\u2019s duly elected representatives\u2019 62-35 vote in favor of it \u2014 and that after 20 hours of debate. In other words, democracy at work.\n\nBut what\u2019s really interesting is how Walker responded to Obama\u2019s tantrum. Rather than meekly taking Obama\u2019s blows, as most Republicans seem wont to do, Walker punched back \u2014 hard.\n\n\u201cOn the heels of vetoing Keystone pipeline legislation, which would have paved the way to create thousands of quality, middle-class jobs, the president should be looking to states, like Wisconsin, as an example for how to grow our economy,\u201d Walker told National Review Online.\n\n\u201cDespite a stagnant national economy and a lack of leadership in Washington, since we took office, Wisconsin\u2019s unemployment rate is down to 5%, and more than 100,000 jobs and 30,000 businesses have been created.\u201d\n\nBam! In just two sentences, Walker shoved Obama\u2019s phony concern for workers back at him and pointed out that Wisconsin is growing its economy despite the flat recovery Obama\u2019s policies have produced nationwide.\n\nEarly in the Obama administration, when public anger over ObamaCare was rising at town hall meetings, Jim Messina, a top White House adviser at the time, reportedly offered Democrats this advice:\n\n\u201cIf you get hit, we will punch back twice as hard.\u201d\n\nObama himself said during his first presidential run that \u201cif they bring a knife to the fight, we bring a gun.\u201d\n\nThe problem is that Republicans too often pull their punches or just run away from the fight. It\u2019s unfortunate and unnecessary. When the GOP resolutely defends free-market principles as Walker has done, it wins. When they\u2019re defensive and apologetic, they lose.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Principles: If Republicans want to know how to respond to President Obama's barbs and attacks, they should pay close attention to what Gov.
