Last year, 7.1 percent of Americans' take-home pay went to health care expenses.\n\nIt's these high health care costs that are literally killing people. People like Charlene Dill.\n\nBack in March, Charlene Dill, a hardworking single mom who worked three jobs to help make ends meet, collapsed and died from an untreated heart condition.\n\nLike approximately 750,000 other Floridians stuck in the Red State doughnut-hole, Charlene knew she was sick and needed medication, but couldn't get it, because Florida's Republican governor, Rick Scott, refused to expand Medicaid under Obamacare, and she couldn't afford to pay out-of-pocket.\n\nMeanwhile, while the costs of health care, housing, education and other expenses have soared for middle class families over the past decade, median household income has fallen by 8 percent.\n\nSo, there you have it.\n\nThirty-four years of failed Reaganomics polices have decimated the American middle class, to the point where Americans can't even meet their most basic of needs.\n\nAmericans can't put roofs over their heads, put their kids through college, pay for life-saving healthcare or save up for retirement.\n\nThis is simply wrong.\n\nWe need to get the middle class back on track.\n\nThat starts by introducing trade policies that protect American jobs, tax policies that even the playing field, adopting policies that make life-saving health care more affordable and education policies that make a college education a reality instead of a pipe dream for millions of Americans.\n\nIt's time to repudiate Reaganomics, so the American middle class can make a comeback.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/templates/ja_teline_iv_t3/images/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Truthout sparks action by revealing systemic injustice and providing a platform for transformative ideas through investigative reporting and analysis.", "author": "The Daily Take Team", "og": {"site_name": "Truthout", "description": "It's time to repudiate Reaganomics, so the American middle class can make a comeback.", "title": "It's Time for the US Middle Class to Make a Comeback", "url": "http://www.truth-out.org/opinion/item/26443-it-s-time-for-the-us-middle-class-to-make-a-comeback", "image": "http://www.truth-out.org/images/images_2014_09/2014_925_mid_st.jpg", "type": "non_profit"}, "title": "It's Time for the US Middle Class to Make a Comeback", "twitter": {"image": "http://www.truth-out.org/images/images_2014_09/2014_925_mid_st.jpg", "title": "It&#039;s Time for the US Middle Class to Make a Comeback", "site": "@truthout", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@truthout"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "fb": {"app_id": 286391544774433}, "keywords": "Truthout, truth-out, truth out, independent news, nonprofit news, ad free news, progressive news, investigative reporting, critical analysis, BuzzFlash, headlines, commentary, fracking, Guantanamo, mass incarceration, prisons, new economy, police militarization, climate change", "google-site-verification": "EfgVxcdUDBF_Dd81ZBBw_J8FuRjGnvp9r2JAM9IhvUk", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "YES", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "It's time to repudiate Reaganomics, so the American middle class can make a comeback.\nWhile owning a house has become next to impossible for the American middle class, renting a house isn't exactly a bargain either.\nConservative economic policies are eating middle class Americans alive - and killing us, too.\nMiddle class Americans also have to use more and more of their take-home pay for medical expenses.\nRally to save the middle class at the Governor's Square in Iowa."}
