Access to healthcare is now available to all women through Obamacare. Planned Parenthood is nothing more than an abortion clinic.\n\nEd Holdgate said Monday, January 11, 2016 at 6:30 am\n\n\n\nPlanned Profit-hood and the hoodlum: a match made in he11 if ever there was one. One day, humanity will deprecate abortion just like virgin sacrifice, prostitution, genocide, slavery, and cannibalism. Abortion does not make you \"un-pregnant\" -- it makes you the mother of a dead child.\n\ndavid taylor said Monday, January 11, 2016 at 7:48 am\n\n\n\nThe only thing sicker than PP is the Republicans who fund it, as PP turns around and spends the money on Democrats.\n\nJoseph Brunoli said Monday, January 11, 2016 at 8:03 am\n\n\n\nPlanned Parenthood is in the tank for Hillary. No surprise because Hillary gave the daughter of Cecile Richards (in photo) a nice cushy well paid job with the Clinton Campaign in Iowa.Quid pro quo. Pay to play.

Bill has most likely sent many women to planned parenthood for abortions and they can't afford to lose that kind of business.\n\ndennis buckley said Monday, January 11, 2016 at 9:49 am\n\n\n\nWhen is Hillary finally going to admit she is a lesbian?\n\nLINDA HARRIS said Monday, January 11, 2016 at 9:51 am\n\n\n\nI knew when I logged into this article I would see the usual rampant ignorance and misogyny. Thanks for not disappointing me!\n\nBob Mulholland said Monday, January 11, 2016 at 10:10 am\n\n\n\nThere are many Republicans who believe, if a 16 year old girl is raped and impregnated and has an abortion should be prosecuted and sent to jail. I see some of them are posting comments here.\n\nGeorge LeMont said Monday, January 11, 2016 at 10:49 am\n\n\n\nBob Mulholland boy when it comes to telling lies and trying to scare the ignorant into voting for your party the lunatic left never disappoints. I'd say those who believe life is a precious gift would simply like the chance to offer an alternative to certain death without the lies being told about them. It's not surprising how the left will never talk about or put on a TV talk show all the women who go into depression after having an abortion. Then of course there's the selling of dead baby parts like a real barbaric society would do.\n\nThomas DePuy said Monday, January 11, 2016 at 10:51 am\n\n\n\nTo champion abortion is sick beyond words. Even if you are pro-abortion, it is a violent, horrendous surgical act, that ends your own child's life. To rally for that with the color pink (representative of a woman's vagina color) is an even greater insult. This right these feminists talk about is the right not to have to be inconvenienced with a 20 minute Dr appt to get on birth control, for girls who are unable to say no to what a man has. Abortion should be a last resort; the end result of many failings, not something celebrated. My level at disgust of this is off the charts. Sad, that the one cause that women seem to celebrate is the right to not have to make a 20 minute Dr appt, so that they can abort their child if they choose. Funny its supposed to he about women's health, what about a mans health? Prostate cancer, STDs and family planning? Well a man just is told- go to your Dr. Duh. A woman has the\"freedom\" to abort her child if she wants, but a man is liable financially at least to pay for 18 years support whether he wants or not. He's told \"you should have thought of that before\" . equality huh? Also, I'll support equal pay next time I see a team of women building a bridge in freezing rain at 3am. Unreal. Unreal. Unreal.\n\nkevin dumont said Monday, January 11, 2016 at 11:04 am\n\n\n\nLinda, This question is for you, Were we not told by King Obama that Obamacare would cover everything, So Linda why do we need Planned Parenthood?\n\nLINDA HARRIS said Monday, January 11, 2016 at 11:22 am\n\n\n\nWomen have been having abortions since time since time immemoriam. The only difference between the abortions now and the ones during Christ's time is that now they are legal and much safer. Get over it.\n\nkevin dumont said Monday, January 11, 2016 at 11:29 am\n\n\n\nLinda, Please answer the question, Didn't King Obama tell us peasants that Obamacare would cover everything, so why do we need planned parenthood? It's not a tough question!\n\nJim Peschke said Monday, January 11, 2016 at 12:21 pm\n\n\n\nIf we had Planned Parenthood and Obamacare during Christ's time we'd all be taxed to pay Judas' 40 pieces of silver, all in the name of \"Women's Rights\". Jesus would be kicked out of public school for using his own name.\n\nDavid McConville said Monday, January 11, 2016 at 12:34 pm\n\n\n\n*You will know them by the company they keep.* Hillary and PP, perfect.\n\nMatt Lulling said Monday, January 11, 2016 at 12:42 pm\n\n\n\nKevin Dumont, perhaps if you were a women instead of a misogynist right wing nut job, you'd know.\n\nLINDA HARRIS said Monday, January 11, 2016 at 1:09 pm\n\n\n\nDUMONT I'm not answering your question because I am not well versed in the Affordable Care Act. And because you sound like an ***** every time you say \"King Obama\". PESCHKE, are you saying women should have no rights?\n\nGeorge LeMont said Monday, January 11, 2016 at 1:10 pm\n\n\n\nLINDA HARRIS but only Nazi Germany would have sold the dead babies for experiments and money. What you don't like is Christians offering an alternative to abortion and seeking a true family structure complete with a mother and father and marriage. Single parent homes do tend to need to live off government and that plays right into your parties quest for power and control of society.\n\nMICHAEL LANE said Monday, January 11, 2016 at 1:12 pm\n\n\n\nLeMont \"when it comes to telling lies and trying to scare the ignorant into voting for your party the lunatic left never disappoints.\" I have seen far more lies coming from the far right. Death panels. PP selling fetal parts. Illegals voting in mass numbers. Mysterious deaths surround the Clintons. WMD. I don't need to go any further, people get the whole picture.\n\nkevin dumont said Monday, January 11, 2016 at 1:19 pm\n\n\n\nLiberal Lulling you truly are a freaking *****! Harris of course you cannot answer why does that not surprise me. Liberal \"independent voter\" Lame does Hillary Clinton come to mind the women has told more lies and is more corrupt than anyone else combined. So I killed 3 idiots with one stone!\n\nkevin dumont said Monday, January 11, 2016 at 1:25 pm\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton, Bought and Paid For! Yes she will represent everyday Americans well! LMAO!\n\nIrene Bean said Monday, January 11, 2016 at 1:27 pm\n\n\n\nMy name is Irene Bean and I am writing as a concerned citizen. Yesterday, Hillary Clinton gained the support and will receive money from Planned Parenthood. I was under the understanding that monies given to a non-profit group / organization are to be used solely for group, ie: the single mothers, families that cannot afford proper care, children and health issues. If this is so, then how is it that a non profit group, such as Planned Parenthood, is allowed to put their voice and give their money to a political group? Something is radically wrong with this picture. Does anyone else agree? Irene Bean\n\nThomas DePuy said Monday, January 11, 2016 at 1:42 pm\n\n\n\nIrene bean: its an excellent point/question. I am also confused. I am also interested in Kevin Dumont's question. I was under the impressions the ACA covered everyone. What now is the purpose of PP?\n\nThomas DePuy said Monday, January 11, 2016 at 1:50 pm\n\n\n\nTo Ms. Brown: there is quite a big difference now and the \" time of Christ\" of women aborting their own children. Women can simply abstain from sex for a day or so, ( if God forbid they can control themselves that long), then call their Dr. And make an appt to get on birth control- whichever method they choose.\n\nLINDA HARRIS said Monday, January 11, 2016 at 1:53 pm\n\n\n\nDEPUY: Ah, I see. It's up to the women to \"control themselves\".\n\nGeorge LeMont said Monday, January 11, 2016 at 1:56 pm\n\n\n\nLane it's bad enough democrat leaders lie right to our faces, but you lying about things I've said doesn't deserve a reply as I have no desire to defend things I've never said and playing your deceitful childish games. It's OK Lane most Americans are already tired of the lies and showed you in last years election. You better concentrate on trying to correct the lying habits of the democrat party because i think many citizens have had enough, even though the democrat party hasn't figured it out yet and keeps selling them more of the same. You really should be in some institution being studied.\n\nAnn Marr said Monday, January 11, 2016 at 2:17 pm\n\n\n\n\"I have noticed that everyone who is for abortion has already been born.\" - Ronald Reagan -\n\nPAUL LUNDWALL said Monday, January 11, 2016 at 2:19 pm\n\n\n\nOur tax dollars at work.\n\nThomas DePuy said Monday, January 11, 2016 at 2:19 pm\n\n\n\nLinda: yes, it is up to a woman to control herself. Would you prefer it be up to the man? If an abortion were a joint decision, than I would say it is up to both man and woman to control themselves. However, since the argument is that its a woman's body and its her choice, than yes,it is up to a woman to control herself, of course. I see that you have not responded to any questions, but with questions.\n\nkevin dumont said Monday, January 11, 2016 at 3:16 pm\n\n\n\nThomas, Linda and Lame never answer questions they are exempt from that, besides if you supply facts they will just dismiss it.\n\nGeorge LeMont said Monday, January 11, 2016 at 3:27 pm\n\n\n\nThomas DePuy what you touch on is an interesting discussion. Though the woman may be the child's host for 9 months, what she is carrying is not just hers. And honestly DNA testing could show the child to be more of the mans genetic makeup than the woman's. But in the end this discussion is really about being a responsible adult and frankly taking responsibility for ones actions and owning them is just one of the values society has thrown away in the name of political correctness where every bad behavior has an excuse.\n\nNORMAN LEBLOND said Monday, January 11, 2016 at 3:51 pm\n\n\n\nJust like a Clinton to stick a finger in the air to see which way the political winds are blowing to get elected. Scary that a group like this has any influence. Talk about far left fringe..... here it is. Planned Fetal Tissue Harvesthood.\n\nPam Smith said Monday, January 11, 2016 at 3:52 pm\n\n\n\nLINDA - Dear Lord your insanity never ceases to amaze me. FIRST, you want the \"govt out of your wombs/bodies\" right? Then why don't you sick abortion loving murderer's pay for your OWN birth control pills, abortions, morning after pills & take NOTHING in funds from the govt for ANY part of your disgusting bodies?! Better yet, don't be a pig & take responsibility if you are going to be a careless *****. You want the govt out of the picture unless it's forking over the blood money for killing babies in the womb. AND, it's easy to be pro-choice when YOU are NOT the one being KILLED. What a sick, sick, sick society. And PLEASE save us from your rape/incest GARBAGE - it accounts for less than 1% of the PP murdered babies.\n\nLINDA HARRIS said Monday, January 11, 2016 at 4:01 pm\n\n\n\nWoman's body, woman's choice. Men can certainly be snipped if they can't control themselves.\n\nJAMES MURRAY said Monday, January 11, 2016 at 4:10 pm\n\n\n\n@Linda HarrisAMEN!\n\nkevin dumont said Monday, January 11, 2016 at 4:27 pm\n\n\n\nLinda Harris, Please answer this question didn't Barack Obama tell the American People that with Obamacare it would cover everything , So please explain in your own words why the taxpayers still need to FUND Planned Parenthood. Thanks in Advance!\n\nLINDA HARRIS said Monday, January 11, 2016 at 4:33 pm\n\n\n\nAs I said, Kevin, I am not well versed enough on the Affordable Care Act to answer that.\n\nGeorge LeMont said Monday, January 11, 2016 at 4:57 pm\n\n\n\nLINDA HARRIS does it ever dawn on you that what you really offer is the division of society and more specifically the breakup of the family unit? You have everything so divided men getting women pregnant today and not being accountable to raising the child is but one more bad behavior getting out of control. but then your party does do very well with more and more needy people stuck in poverty so it does fit the plan I would imagine.\n\nkevin dumont said Monday, January 11, 2016 at 5:00 pm\n\n\n\nOne more thing long at these photos you think these women won the powerball. Pathetic bunch if you ask me!\n\nLINDA HARRIS said Monday, January 11, 2016 at 5:23 pm\n\n\n\nGEORGE, women are perfectly capable of taking care of themselves. To be honest, women don't really need men anymore.\n\njohn green said Monday, January 11, 2016 at 5:56 pm\n\n\n\nLets see, if a woman in child is murdered and the child dies in her womb,The one who committed the murder is charged with murder for both mother and baby. So how is it that a woman killing her baby in her womb is not murder.. You all cant have it both ways. Abortion is murder plain and simple. ABORTION IS MURDER\n\nPAUL LUNDWALL said Monday, January 11, 2016 at 6:50 pm\n\n\n\nLinda PP has nothing to do with woman's rights.\n\nPAUL LUNDWALL said Monday, January 11, 2016 at 6:55 pm\n\n\n\nHillary was working on UFOs and Area 51 last week. This sick wonan sure gets around trying to please every group possible. Two weeks ago she promised a cure for Alzheimer's. What is next? Perhaps giving refugees that right to vote?\n\nAlan Schwantz said Monday, January 11, 2016 at 8:32 pm\n\n\n\nHildabeast is down to her last few places that will endorse her.With the new FBI investigations against the Clinton foundation she is a sinking ship...\n\nLINDA HARRIS said Monday, January 11, 2016 at 9:54 pm\n\n\n\nJohn Green, you are comparing apples and oranges. Woman's body, woman's choice.\n\nGeorge LeMont said Tuesday, January 12, 2016 at 7:42 am\n\n\n\nLINDA HARRIS all I can say is Wow! Keep handing out the drugs to society Linda, maybe Sean Penn will help you.\n\nMICHAEL LANE said Tuesday, January 12, 2016 at 7:53 am\n\n\n\nLeMont there is a saying about a shoe fitting. Are you the only person on the far right? Did I name you as one of the many liars (although you do repeat some of the lies)? I would not hang my hat on the lowest voter turnout in 75 years as showing us anything. We shall see in November.\n\nThomas Daniels said Tuesday, January 12, 2016 at 10:14 am\n\n\n\nLinda Harris.. ..I believe that the information you claim that you do not have.. is readily available on the pp website... \"DUMONT I'm not answering your question because I am not well versed in the Affordable Care Act. \" Might I suggest that you go to the planned parenthood website.. www.plannedparenthood.org/about-us/newsroom/the-affordable-care-act....It takes about about thirty seconds to read.... After reading, you should be able to answer Mr DuMont's question... Glad I could be of assistance. I look forward to your response.\n\nkevin dumont said Tuesday, January 12, 2016 at 10:40 am\n\n\n\nThomas.. Cue The Crickets.\n\njohn green said Tuesday, January 12, 2016 at 1:46 pm\n\n\n\nLinda, no comparing apples and oranges. Im talking about a live baby in a womb . Murder is murder , you cant have it both ways\n\nPAUL LUNDWALL said Tuesday, January 12, 2016 at 2:00 pm\n\n\n\nJust remember Hillary was not the First Lady of the White House perhaps third or forth but not first.\n\nGeorge LeMont said Tuesday, January 12, 2016 at 2:59 pm\n\n\n\nLane Hillary is about to be indited, but only if Obama listens to the FBI and allows it and doesn't use his dictator like powers to brush Hillary's abuse of power under the rug. She might not make it to the election, but then being a felon or a pervert never seems to stop democrat voters from putting people into office.\n\nkevin dumont said Tuesday, January 12, 2016 at 3:50 pm\n\n\n\nGeorge, These are the people Liberals like Lame adore, come on now felons have rights too.\n\nMICHAEL LANE said Tuesday, January 12, 2016 at 4:36 pm\n\n\n\nLeMont says what right wing news outlet? FOX news is the only outlet reporting an expansion of the FBI investigation. And all you on the right wing have her convicted, sent to jail and charged.\n\nMICHAEL LANE said Tuesday, January 12, 2016 at 4:42 pm\n\n\n\ngreen can a \"baby in the womb\" breathe on its own? If not, it is a fetus.\n\nMICHAEL LANE said Tuesday, January 12, 2016 at 4:59 pm\n\n\n\nDePuy I take it that you are not currently married. A boyfriend or husband has no responsibility? You sound like most right wingers who seem to believe only single women seek out abortions. You seem to think that men are not involved in the decision (sometimes an abortion is demanded by the male partner). I think you are a misogynist.\n\nLINDA HARRIS said Tuesday, January 12, 2016 at 5:32 pm\n\n\n\nJohn Green, it is not a live baby. It is a fetus or a zygote.\n\nLINDA HARRIS said Tuesday, January 12, 2016 at 5:35 pm\n\n\n\nThomas Daniels, thanks for your help, hun.\n\nkevin dumont said Tuesday, January 12, 2016 at 7:00 pm\n\n\n\nLinda and Mike..
