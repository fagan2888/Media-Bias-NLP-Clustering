(AP) - Adrian Peterson burst through the line of scrimmage and veered toward the sideline as he headed up the field.\n\nSafety Robert Blanton had the Minnesota Vikings running back in his sights and eased off the throttle as he went in to \u201cthud\u201d Peterson, looking to deliver a cordial bump during the team\u2019s first training camp practice with players in pads. To Blanton\u2019s surprise, Peterson lowered his shoulder and delivered a jolt to the fourth-year defensive back.\n\nMost veterans dread the early days of camp and the first few hits that open the door to six months filled with jarring blows, aches and pains.\n\nNot Peterson. He hadn\u2019t felt the pop of the pads for more than 10 months, an exile brought on by child abuse allegations against him. With the case settled, his punishment over, his contract situation resolved and fans welcoming him back to the field, Peterson couldn\u2019t help but be a little eager to finally get back to the business of football.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been looking forward to it for a long time,\u201d said Peterson, who missed the final 15 games of last season. \u201cIt was good to get the first day down. I feel comfortable. I didn\u2019t feel sluggish or weighed down because of the pads. I felt pretty good.\u201d\n\nVikings owner Mark Wilf said he was only too happy to see Peterson back on the field with a smile on his face after so much drama surrounding the team and its star player.\n\n\u201cObviously he\u2019s a unique talent and a good person,\u201d Wilf said. \u201cWe\u2019re happy he\u2019s here playing for us. We can\u2019t wait for the season to get going here.\u201d\n\nThere were times in the offseason that it appeared like Peterson could be parting ways with the only NFL franchise for which he has played. A perceived lack of support from some in the organization, and the criticism that was heaped upon him by many fans and media when the allegations first surfaced, had Peterson thinking that it was time to move on.\n\nBut he was still under contract and the Vikings refused to entertain the idea of trading a player they believe can resume his role as the focal point of the offense, even as he passes the 30-year-old milestone that has spelled the beginning of the end for so many running backs before him.\n\nAs a show of faith, the Vikings also restructured Peterson\u2019s contract to guarantee him $7 million next season in case of injury. It was the last in a series of efforts by the organization to smooth things over heading into a season with high expectations.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s had a long history here with the Vikings and the community,\u201d Wilf said. \u201cWe know what kind of person he is. That\u2019s all in the rearview mirror as far as some of that stuff goes and we\u2019re looking forward to him being a big part of our team going forward.\u201d\n\nWhile Peterson occasionally had doubts about the support he had in the front office, his confidence in his teammates never wavered. Throughout the last 10 months, not one Vikings player has gone on the record to express any reservations about Peterson, which has allowed him to step right back into a leadership role on the team.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it ever left,\u201d Peterson said about his status in the locker room. \u201cThat\u2019s the thing about the family I\u2019m surrounded by. These guys, they\u2019ve been supporting me. Such an unfortunate situation.\n\n\u201cBut when it\u2019s family and they know you,\u201d he said, looking at a throng of media surrounding him, \u201csome of you guys, I don\u2019t know you so I wouldn\u2019t pass judgment based off what I\u2019ve heard or what I\u2019ve seen if I didn\u2019t know what type of person you are. That\u2019s just the type of world we live in. These guys, they know me. They know what I\u2019m made of.\u201d\n\n___\n\nOnline:\n\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and AP NFL Twitter feed: www.twitter.com/AP_NFL", "article_metadata": {"description": "Adrian Peterson burst through the line of scrimmage and veered toward the sideline as he headed up the field.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Adrian Peterson burst through the line of scrimmage and veered toward the sideline as he headed up the field.", "title": "Adrian Peterson back in pads and moving forward with Vikings", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jul/29/adrian-peterson-back-in-pads-and-moving-forward-wi/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/07/28/74bae74fa5ae7e217d0f6a7067004c26.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/07/28/74bae74fa5ae7e217d0f6a7067004c26.jpg", "description": "Adrian Peterson burst through the line of scrimmage and veered toward the sideline as he headed up the field.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Adrian Peterson back in pads and moving forward with Vikings"}, "Author": "JON KRAWCZYNSKI", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9cac\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI\u2019ve been looking forward to it for a long time,\u201d said Peterson, who missed the final 15 games of last season.\n\u201cObviously he\u2019s a unique talent and a good person,\u201d Wilf said.\nMANKATO, Minn.
