Other estimates range from roughly 60% becoming eligible for Medi-Cal and 30% for private health insurance based on income.\n\nCalifornia is the second-highest user of Ryan White funds behind New York, according to California officials. The budget for care in 2012 was $2.4 billion, behind Medicaid, which cost $5.3 billion, and Medicare, which cost $5.4 billion.\n\nConcerns Raised for Sensitive Population\n\nSome health experts and HIV advocates are worried that the transition will create problems for a sensitive population whose health relies on routine care from specialty providers.\n\nAdvocates said people living with HIV/AIDS could experience gaps in care as the ACA moves toward full implementation, face the possibility of having to change providers, be forced to pay for expensive antiretroviral medications and experience confusion about the changes that lie ahead.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re concerned that clients will not know that they\u2019ll have to transition,\u201d said Courtney Mulhern-Pearson, director for state and local affairs for the San Francisco AIDS Foundation. \u201cFor Medi-Cal managed care plans, we\u2019re also not clear whether or not the provider networks will be adequate, and we know that for someone with HIV, they have better health outcomes if they\u2019re treated by a provider with HIV experience.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur biggest concern is making sure that people have access to the appropriate level of care,\u201d Mulhern-Pearson added. \u201cThat means staying linked to their current provider, maintaining coordinated care without treatment interruptions and having access to HIV medications that aren\u2019t prohibitively expensive. There\u2019s a lot that we\u2019re worried about.\u201d\n\nHRSA spokesperson Elizabeth Senerchia pointed out that while thousands of California residents will move toward another model of health care, the Ryan White Program will remain in place to fill gaps in care.\n\n\u201cIt is important to note that the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program is and will continue to be the payer of last resort,\u201d Senerchia said, adding that individuals currently using Ryan White services will be \u201cexpected to vigorously pursue eligibility for all other funding sources.\u201d\n\nSan Francisco\u2019s Preparations\n\nIn San Francisco, roughly 7,700 uninsured people with HIV/AIDS use Ryan White funds for care, according to the San Francisco HIV Health Reform Task Force.\n\nThe task force, which includes Mulhern-Pearson, San Francisco Department of Public Health officials, providers and people with HIV/AIDS, last month released a set of goals and associated policy recommendations that underline the complex policies that must be aligned before Jan. 1. The goals include:\n\nPromoting successful community-based interventions aimed at outreach, testing and linkage to care;\n\nReducing barriers to timely, quality, affordable and patient-centered care;\n\nEnsuring culturally appropriate patient-centered care;\n\nPromoting continuity of coordinated care; and\n\nImproving individual and community health outcomes.\n\nAlthough other counties also are preparing, San Francisco appears to be ahead of the curve in thinking about how the ACA will affect its low-income residents currently served by Ryan White, according to Peter Lee, executive director of Covered California, the state\u2019s health insurance exchange.\n\n\u201cSan Francisco has been a leader in providing health care,\u201d Lee said at a recent Covered California town hall meeting at the University of California-San Francisco. He also noted that San Francisco\u2019s potential issues with transitioning its HIV/AIDS population are mirrored throughout the state.\n\nSan Francisco last year evaluated the transition of hundreds of residents to the Low Income Health Program and has experience treating the uninsured through the city\u2019s universal care system, Healthy San Francisco. The city plans to hold a series of meetings in October and November to assist people who are transitioning to Medi-Cal or to the exchange.\n\nMulhern-Pearson said the task force is contacting San Franciscans who will become eligible for Medi-Cal \u2014 individuals with incomes lower than $15,000 annually, or 138% of the federal poverty level \u2014 to offer application assistance. She said the task force also is beginning to evaluate the health plans that will be offered through Covered California and figure out who will qualify for subsidies.\n\n\u201cPatients with HIV may see charges that they\u2019ve never seen before,\u201d Mulhern-Pearson said. \u201cI think that has potential to worsen the problem because the fees under Covered California, while they are better than we expected them to be, I think they will still be a hardship for many clients who are very low income.\u201d\n\nAmong providers and patients, there are more questions than answers, Mulhern-Pearson said.\n\nThe response so far has been confusion, she said. \u201cI think people know that health care reform is really difficult \u2014 it\u2019s really complicated, and you lose people really early when you start to explain all the complexities. Here, I think it\u2019s really hard for people to understand how they fit into the bigger picture when we\u2019re doing our outreach.\u201d\n\nLos Angeles Concerns Similar to Those in North\n\nIn Los Angeles, county officials and advocates are also grappling with how to make the transition smooth.\n\nLast year, 19,915 of the estimated 59,500 people living with HIV/AIDS received care under Ryan White. L.A. officials and advocates have many of the same concerns as their counterparts in the north.\n\n\u201cThis is an enormous transition from one funding stream to another,\u201d said Philip Curtis, who oversees the policy and advocacy activities for AIDS Project Los Angeles. \u201cThis is only one of the transitions the state is trying to accomplish in the next year. That makes it even more challenging.\u201d\n\nCurtis said many of the potential problems with Ryan White patients experiencing gaps in care, or a loss of their primary care physician, are not yet apparent because the transition is in its beginning stages.\n\n\u201cIt will take years for the programs in the ACA to settle in, and we know from testimony from people who dealt with the Massachusetts transition, that these things are cumbersome and don\u2019t happen overnight,\u201d he said. \u201cSo in many ways, we won\u2019t know about any specific cases until years down the road. It\u2019s important for us to monitor that.\u201d\n\nLong-Term Benefits\n\nWhile hiccups in transitioning Ryan White patients could cost more and potentially create gaps in care, there are clear long-term benefits, Mulhern-Pearson said.\n\n\u201cThis is what we\u2019ve been fighting for, to have access to stable, comprehensive care for people with HIV,\u201d she said. \u201cSo in many ways, the ACA is a huge victory, and it has potential for people to access that more stable and comprehensive care. Ryan White will still be there to fill in the gaps.\u201d\n\nGovernment officials underscored Mulhern-Pearson\u2019s point that long-term benefits could outweigh some of the short-term problems.\n\n\u201cThe ACA is an historic opportunity for people living with HIV, including those currently receiving services through the Ryan White Program,\u201d Senerchia said. \u201cFull implementation of the ACA does not eliminate the need for the Ryan White Program. It will continue to provide the vitally needed services that constitute comprehensive care for people living with HIV/AIDS, which is proven to reduce transmission of the virus.\u201d\n\nProviders and others associated with health plans also said there is potential for long-term benefits for residents living with HIV/AIDS.\n\n\u201cHealth care reform will result in better access to care for many people \u2014 including those with HIV,\u201d said Mike Smith, executive director for the AIDS Emergency Fund and president of the HIV/AIDS Provider Network. \u201cBut it also includes major changes to the way HIV-related medical care and support services will be funded and delivered.\u201d\n\nAndrea Weddle, executive director of the HIV Medical Association, said the long-term benefits are clear, but his organization, which represents health researchers and providers, has significant concerns about the availability of doctors able to provide services.\n\n\u201cIn the short term, as people gain coverage under Medi-Cal managed care plans or under the exchange, our primary concern is that their current providers won\u2019t be in the new plan networks,\u201d Weddle said. \u201cThis is a huge evolving change to our health care system, and it\u2019s important, but from the provider\u2019s perspective, it\u2019s critical to maintain an effective comprehensive care model along the lines of a medical home. That\u2019s what we\u2019re focusing on.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "<p>The Affordable Care Act will bring changes for thousands of Californians with HIV/AIDS, including possible interruptions in care.
