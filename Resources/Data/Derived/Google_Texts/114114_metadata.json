Unlike, say, Blackberry, mentioning CGI Federal at a cocktail party hasn\u2019t tended to elicit strong opinions or emotional heat. After all, it\u2019s a Canadian IT company.\n\nThat shroud of gentle anonymity has dissipated, however. America is now officially pissed off at Montreal-based CGI, and the company is hunkering down under a barrage of questions \u2014 including the one asked on air by a CNBC host: \u201cShould we immediately go to war with Canada over the CGI thing?\u201d\n\nThe \u201cthing\u201d is the error-plagued national website for Obamacare, healthcare.gov, and the large sum of money CGI was paid to build it. Even ten days after going live, the site is, by most reports, still virtually inoperable. Users hit a wall of errors when they try to price plans or find out what subsidies they may qualify for. By pretty much all accounts, the launch of the website has been a complete fiasco.\n\nWhile the news media has stayed largely focused on the shutdown, the question of how much American taxpayers shelled out for the busted site has generated a fair amount of heat and speculation online. Was it $634 million, as one report suggested? A CGI official rejected that figure as too high in a comment to the Blaze, Glenn Beck\u2019s eclectic media property. The Washington Post reported that \u201cCGI has been awarded at least $88 million by CMS to build the federal exchange and provide related technical support.\u201d (CGI did not respond to our request for comment.)\n\nSeeking insight, Daily Intelligencer tracked down a senior official at the Department of Health and Human Services who, on the condition of anonymity, was willing to give us the skinny on CGI\u2019s Obamacare work \u2014 and how much the company was paid for it. The official, who did not have permission to speak to the press, is a contracting specialist at HHS who has managed more than $1 billion in purchases (although did not work directly with CGI).\n\nThe answer? All contracts between CGI and the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the arm of HHS that is charged with implementing the Affordable Care Act, inked since mid-2010 were for Obamacare IT work. The total value of the contracts meeting that description (they can be found here) is $515 million.\n\n\"It is safe to say that everything CGI has done for HHS since Obamacare passed is related in some way to Obamacare and preparations for the rollout of healthcare.gov,\u201d said the official. \u201cEven technological alterations to the Medicare and Medicaid systems were modifications required by Obamacare. None of it happens separately. It's all one massive system now.\"\n\nWhether this Obamacare broader IT ecosystem is of higher quality than the gateway website isn't clear. Certainly, there is already much concern. (Our HHS official opted not to comment on the matter.)\n\nObama, HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, and various pro-ACA pundits have said the site\u2019s woes are a result of overwhelming demand \u2014 but that argument is being batted away even by friendly witnesses.\n\n\u201cThere is no excuse for not withstanding that traffic,\u201d says digital political strategist Karl Frisch, a former spokesman for liberal think tank Media Matters for America and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. The tasks of the campaign and Obamacare websites are radically different and managed by different people, Frisch said, but \"if Obama for America was missing the opportunity to collect donations and e-mail addresses from the volume of people visiting the site, that would be unacceptable. One would hope that's the case in the government environment, but it\u2019s not.\u201d\n\nAnother politically friendly critic is Clay Johnson, co-founder of Blue State Digital, the agency that helped Obama win the technological ground game in two presidential elections. In mid-2012, Johnson left BSD to work at the White House as a presidential innovation fellow, a six-month gig in which he was assigned to design new, easy-to-use systems to encourage small businesses to bid on government contracts.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been three years and [hundreds of millions of dollars] for this level of poor performance?\u201d Johnson said, continuing a scathing assessment that began with a blog post entitled \"The Healthcare.gov Fiasco.\" \u201cI buy that lots of people are on the site and that causes problems. That excuse is valid for Day 1. We ought to be forgiving about that stuff. But now that we\u2019re out there a week later and \u2026 the site hasn\u2019t technically changed very much. It shows no signs of recovery.\u201d\n\nBut Johnson sees the healthcare.gov fiasco as more of a systemic crisis than a blunder by CGI or the Obama adminstration. The federal system for letting big contracts favors large, entrenched companies with a history of government contracts \u2014 typified by CGI, a $10 billion company \u2014 and excludes smaller, more innovative firms that could do the work better and cheaper, following the model of Silicon Valley start-ups. This way of doing things, in his view, will generally produce poor-quality, expensive work.\n\nGeorge Washington Law professor Joshua Schwartz, an expert on government procurement law, agrees that the system for contracting out projects like healthcare.gov is broken. \u201cThere is probably a lesson here on unintended consequences,\u201d Schwartz says. \u201cEach of these rules and regulations is probably well intended and serves a genuine need, but when you put it all together it makes the system a little bit of a straitjacket. It\u2019s mistrust of government that leads to this straitjacket, and then this straitjacket leads to more mistrust of government.\u201d\n\nIronically, the many failures could end up benefiting CGI, said Johnson. \u201cWhat really terrifies me is that the contractor that built this is going to say, \u2018Yep, that\u2019s going to cost a lot more money to fix.\u2019\u201d In other words, we may go to war with Canada yet.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#000", "description": "$515 million, according to one government official.", "generator": "the-factory", "og": {"site_name": "Daily Intelligencer", "description": "$515 million, according to one government official.", "title": "How Much Did the Government Pay for Obamacare\u2019s Broken Website?", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2013/10/how-much-did-obamacares-broken-website-cost.html", "image": "http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2013/10/09/09-obamacare-website.w1200.h630.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@intelligencer", "image": "http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2013/10/09/09-obamacare-website.w750.h560.2x.jpg", "description": "$515 million, according to one government official.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "How Much Did Obamacare\u2019s Broken Website Cost?"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Daily Intelligencer", "fb": {"app_id": 120608177953522}, "msapplication-TileImage": "//cache.nymag.com/media/di/icon.144x144.png", "application-name": "Daily Intelligencer", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "obamacare, blame canada, politics", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NewYorkMag", "tag": "obamacare,blame canada,politics", "published_time": "2013-10-11T20:25:00.000Z"}, "topics": "topics-test, obamacare, blame canada, politics", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbb44\"", "article_summary": "A CGI official rejected that figure as too high in a comment to the Blaze, Glenn Beck\u2019s eclectic media property.\n(Our HHS official opted not to comment on the matter.)\nGeorge Washington Law professor Joshua Schwartz, an expert on government procurement law, agrees that the system for contracting out projects like healthcare.gov is broken.\nBy pretty much all accounts, the launch of the website has been a complete fiasco.\nWhether this Obamacare broader IT ecosystem is of higher quality than the gateway website isn't clear."}
