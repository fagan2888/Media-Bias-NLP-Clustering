But this year\u2019s winners, announced earlier today, won for research that actually affects our everyday lives.\n\nJeffrey Brown has the story.\n\nJEFFREY BROWN: A trio of scientists won for the invention of blue light-emitting diodes, often referred to as LEDs.\n\nThe blue LEDs, first created in the early 90s, paved the way for brighter and more energy-efficient white lights, the kind now seen on the screens of phones, TVs and computers, even signs on the subway.\n\nTwo of the scientists were from Japan, one from the U.S.\n\nOur science correspondent, Miles O\u2019Brien, joins me now from Boston to tell us about it.\n\nSo, Miles, the invention of blue light-emitting diodes, what exactly does that mean?\n\nMILES O\u2019BRIEN: Well, we had red and we had green, and we needed blue the take it over the top.\n\nLet\u2019s step back for a little bit. Back in the \u201960s, when they created the first light-emitting diodes, red was the first one because it was the easiest to make. The semiconducting material that makes that particular color was much easier to make in an efficient way. Then came green. And you can think about the first calculator you got, which was always with a red light emitting diode. And eventually we got into green.\n\nBut blue was difficult because the material that creates that particular color, that wavelength, was hard to work with. Gallium nitride was the tricky thing that was difficult for scientists and engineers to efficiently turn into the crystals to mass produce.\n\nBut once you have red, green and blue, put them together, you have white light, and that\u2019s created a revolution.\n\nJEFFREY BROWN: Well, that\u2019s the word that the Nobel committee used, revolutionizing lighting. So it has seeped into all facets of life.\n\nMILES O\u2019BRIEN: Well, think about the incandescent lightbulb, which is just a hot, glowing filament in a vacuum tube. Then we went to fluorescent lights, much more efficient.\n\nAnd now we\u2019re in the world of LEDs, which if you go back to the incandescent bulb, comparing it, 20 times more efficient, and lasts much longer. You know, a quarter of the energy on our planet is spent in creating light. And in order to reduce all of our need for energy and our carbon footprint, LEDs make a huge, significant impact.\n\nJEFFREY BROWN: You know, it\u2019s interesting. The academy also said that this year\u2019s prize is very specifically more for invention than discovery.\n\nWe often look at these prizes, especially in something like physics, as going for more basic research.\n\nMILES O\u2019BRIEN: Yes. Of course, last year they honored the \u2014 Professor Higgs of the Higgs boson, the God particle, if you will, which takes us right back to the very origins of everything, the Big Bang, but difficult to say that has any real-world application, except that it helps us understand where we all came from.\n\nThis is applied science at its best. If you look back to what Alfred Nobel wanted when he created this prize, it was something that had huge impact on humanity and how we live. And, certainly, the LED light has done that.\n\nJEFFREY BROWN: That\u2019s what he wanted, but it doesn\u2019t \u2014 it doesn\u2019t usually come out that way, at least in immediate practical responses from the work, right?\n\nMILES O\u2019BRIEN: Yes.\n\nNo, frankly, for those of us on the outside of the world of physics, sometimes, it\u2019s hard to decipher exactly what happened, right?\n\nJEFFREY BROWN: Exactly.\n\nMILES O\u2019BRIEN: Right?\n\nJEFFREY BROWN: Yes. Yes.\n\nMILES O\u2019BRIEN: Because we\u2019re talking about very esoteric things.\n\nAnd it takes a little bit of work to understand the significance. In this case, we all immediately know, wow, that LED light which is on my smartphone, which powers my battery, which is changing the way streetlighting works, is changing things in the Third World in very significant ways, where people are turning in kerosene lanterns for LED lights, it\u2019s had a huge impact, and it\u2019s only really just begun in some ways.\n\nJEFFREY BROWN: Now, let me just, in our last minute or so here, let\u2019s turn to yesterday\u2019s announcement, which was the prize for medicine. This was described as a kind of GPS system for the brain, using another kind of technology that we\u2019re all now familiar with, but applying it to brain research.\n\nMILES O\u2019BRIEN: Yes.\n\nThe award was split between two \u2014 three scientists, two of them \u2014 two teams. One \u2014 the first bit of research goes back a while to the discovery that the hippocampus part of our brain is what maps our orientation. They actually looked inside a rodent\u2019s brain as it was moving around a room and could see when it was any \u2014 in any particular place a specific part of the brain would sort of light up, with you \u2014 if you will.\n\nThat was further enhanced by a married couple team from Norway which found a neighboring region of the brain where we actually have the ability to set up sort of a grid system, which allows us to remember where we parked the car, for example, to give us kind of a spatial orientation.\n\nAnd in looking at the way the rats navigate and seeing what their brains are doing, they really understand how this works. So what is really exciting about all this is this is what we first see the early signs of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. And understanding what\u2019s going on with this part of the brain might help us, first of all, diagnose sooner, and also might help us understand Alzheimer\u2019s in a more meaningful way, where we can provide some treatments.\n\nJEFFREY BROWN: All right, so this prize really is for potential, looking forward to some spectacular work in the future perhaps, right?\n\nMILES O\u2019BRIEN: One would hope, but it is really interesting to understand how our brain has the ability to kind of create its own \u2014 you know, we say in our mind\u2019s eye. This is our mind\u2019s eye.\n\nJEFFREY BROWN: All right.
