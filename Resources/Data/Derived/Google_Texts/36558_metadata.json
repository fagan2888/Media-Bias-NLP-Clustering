Residents here depend on fishing and shrimping for their livelihood, and when they sit down to eat, they like most things fried.\n\nIt\u2019s here that former U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Regina Benjamin has been trying to reverse the nation\u2019s obesity epidemic one patient at a time. Benjamin grew up near Bayou La Batre and has run a health clinic in this town of seafood workers and ship builders since 1990. As obesity became commonplace around the U.S., health care providers like Benjamin began seeing the impacts of obesity all around them.\n\n\u201cWe saw our patient population get heavier,\u201d Benjamin said. \u201cWe saw chronic diseases start to rise, and if we continued, our entire community would totally be crippled, basically, based on chronic diseases.\u201d\n\nTwo major trends are on a collision course here, as in the rest of the United States: a decades-long surge in obesity and the aging of the U.S. population. Today, one out of every three adults in the U.S. are clinically obese, and many who have lived for decades with excess weight, diabetes and heart disease are now heading into their senior years. Obese people are far more likely to become sick or disabled as they age, and researchers say this burgeoning demographic will strain hospitals and nursing homes.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re potentially going to have a larger, older population that\u2019s more likely to be obese, surviving longer with cardiovascular disease and other chronic diseases,\u201d said Dr. Virginia Chang, a demographer at New York University. \u201cI think that the primary fallout from increasing obesity is probably not going to be some huge hit to mortality. It\u2019s going to be disability.\u201d\n\nThose consequences may already be visible, researchers say. Lifelong obesity, now common across the country, is poised to undermine improvements in disability rates among older adults.\n\nSteven Austad, chairman of the biology department at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, studies the effects of diet and nutrition on aging using mice. He says researchers used to think that aging was driven by different processes.\n\n\u201cYour heart aged, your brain aged, your feet aged,\u201d he said. \u201cBut now, we\u2019ve realized, there\u2019s a handful of processes that are involved in aging all parts of your body. And it turns out, one of those processes is inflammation.\u201d\n\nInflammation naturally increases as we age, but that process is exacerbated by belly fat, which secretes chemicals that cause further inflammation around the body. \u201cIf you\u2019re obese, then your system-wide levels of inflammation are higher, particularly when you get older,\u201d said Austad.\n\nThat\u2019s one reason scientists think men and women who are obese are more likely to develop dementia, Alzheimer\u2019s disease and certain cancers as they age.\n\nBob Parker, a Birmingham area resident, says his own weight is starting to catch up with him. As a realtor and Democratic party activist, he often attends meetings at restaurants and says all those nights dining out make it hard to eat well.\n\nNow, at age 60, he\u2019s being treated for diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and sleep apnea. He\u2019s lost 90 pounds\u2014twice\u2014and gained it back. \u201cIt\u2019s taken some energy away, for sure,\u201d Parker said of his weight. \u201cI like to do things out in the yard and I just can\u2019t work on them as much. So, that\u2019s pretty galling to be honest.\u201d\n\nObesity is an expensive disease, especially for aging seniors. One study found that while obese 70-year-olds live as long as healthy weight 70-year-olds, they will spend $39,000 more on health care.\n\n\u201cObese people have higher healthcare costs than non-obese people. This is true virtually throughout life,\u201d said David Allison, director of the Nutrition Obesity Research Center at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. As a person gets into the age when health care spending goes up, \u201cthat difference is going to be bigger and bigger and more and more important.\u201d\n\nIn part because of disability and poor health, surveys show more obese people are heading into nursing homes at younger ages and staying longer than non-obese residents. Two hours from Birmingham, in the northwest corner of the state, Generations of Red Bay is one of the only nursing homes in the region that is willing to take on the added expense of caring for heavier residents. Patients come from as far away as Texas.\n\nMargaret Hilldouglas arrived here two years ago, at age 47, after she broke her knee. Surgery was considered too risky because of her congestive heart failure, so she languished in a hospital for weeks while a social worker looked for a nursing home that would accept her.\n\nPatients like Hilldouglas require additional staff and costly equipment, including specialized beds, mechanical lifts, larger blood pressure cuffs and longer needles, said Aundrea Fuller, chief operating officer of Generations of Red Bay.\n\n\u201cThere are two certified nursing assistants for eight to ten residents. And that\u2019s about twice the staffing that you would have for the general population of a skilled nursing facility.\u201d Most of the obese residents that move in here, even the younger ones, will need this type of care for the rest of their lives, Fuller said.\n\nAt the University of Alabama at Birmingham\u2019s weight loss clinic, Bernard Rayford, 55, said he wants to avoid that fate. \u201cI\u2019ve always prayed, Lord, before I be a burden, just take me. I saw myself being a burden, and me being a major problem,\u201d Rayford said after a vigorous workout in the clinic\u2019s gym. \u201cThe end was for me not to make it. Or for me to end up being in an ambulance. And that\u2019s, that\u2019s the direction I don\u2019t want to be in.\u201d\n\n\u25cf This KHN story also ran on PBS News Hour.\n\n\u25cf KHN\u2019s coverage of aging and long term care issues is supported in part by a grant from The SCAN Foundation.\n\n\u25cf svarney@kff.org | @SarahVarney4", "article_metadata": {"description": "March 2, 2015 - Bayou La Batre, Alabama, calls itself the seafood capital of Alabama.
