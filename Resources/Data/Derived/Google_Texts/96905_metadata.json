We rehash the same facile, boring conversations about alcohol, about the \u201cambiguities of hookup culture,\u201d about so-called common sense approaches to preventing sexual assault that almost always involve girls and women modifying their behavior in ways big and small. We fire back the same (necessary, but totally exhausting) critiques, we talk about rape culture and victim-blaming. We rinse. We repeat. We are stuck in an absurd, repetitive loop.\n\nSex education might be the thing to break it. As I\u2019ve pointed out before, sex education in the United States is a total mess. Only 22 states and the District of Columbia require that public schools teach sex education, and only 19 of those states have laws ensuring that what\u2019s being taught meets the minimum requirement of being medically or factually accurate. Changing this will first require that schools embrace sex education, and embrace sex educators who can speak openly and directly about the sex teens and young adults are actually having. That means going beyond talking about condoms and birth control (something that isn\u2019t happening nearly enough as it is), and getting into consent, mutual desire and mutual pleasure.\n\nAffirmative consent, defined broadly, is making sure that the person you want to have sex with wants to have sex with you. But just mention the words and you\u2019re bound to hear something about Kenyon or Antioch and the madness of \u201990s progressive culture, the death of romance and spontaneity or some other garbage about political correctness run amok, whatever that means. (The GOP, the party most comfortable with putting the state in your bedroom and doctor\u2019s office, apparently draws the line at the dorm room.) The real conversation about affirmative consent is one about mutual desire, mutual pleasure and active rather than passive sexuality. Talking more before, during and after sex not only helps to ensure that all parties are on board with what\u2019s happening, it allows people to express what feels good, what doesn\u2019t, what\u2019s comfortable, what isn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s admittedly somewhat of a departure from the way our society often approaches sex,\u201d Tara Culp-Ressler recently wrote for ThinkProgress. \u201cRecent studies have found that most college students feel uncomfortable voicing their desires during sexual encounters, and there\u2019s a gender imbalance in whose pleasure is prioritized. But the emphasis on getting consent isn\u2019t an effort to turn everyone into rapists. It\u2019s just about encouraging better communication across the board.\u201d\n\nThis communication is something that many teens and young adults don\u2019t feel equipped to do right now, and that\u2019s a problem. The lack of education about and interest in consent and communication was made frighteningly clear in a recent piece in Bloomberg News, in which a number of college men discussed how supposedly fearful they had become of sex now that the dialogue about accountability and sexual violence is being taken seriously. But rather than solving the problem with more talking, most of these young men seemed content to do even less.", "article_metadata": {"description": "There's no single solution to America's sexual assault crisis, but teaching kids about sex is one place to start", "author": "Katie McDonough", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "There's no single solution to America's sexual assault crisis, but teaching kids about sex is one place to start", "title": "Let\u2019s talk about sex (more): Education, conversation is the way to help prevent sexual assault", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/08/28/lets_talk_about_sex_more_education_conversation_is_the_way_to_help_prevent_sexual_assault/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/teens_talk.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "There's no single solution to America's sexual assault crisis, but teaching kids about sex is one place to start", "creator": "@kmcdonovgh", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/teens_talk.jpg", "title": "Let\u2019s talk about sex (more): Education, conversation is the way to help prevent sexual assault", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Let\u2019s talk about sex (more): Education, conversation is the way to help prevent sexual assault", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Campus rape, Editor's Picks, Rape, Sexual assault, sexual violence, victim blaming, Violence Against Women", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1200\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Campus rape, Editor's Picks, Rape, Sexual assault, sexual violence, victim blaming, Violence Against Women, Life News, Politics NewsThere\u2019s a familiar script that we follow when talking about sexual violence, particularly rape on college campuses.\nAs I\u2019ve pointed out before, sex education in the United States is a total mess.\nChanging this will first require that schools embrace sex education, and embrace sex educators who can speak openly and directly about the sex teens and young adults are actually having.\nSex education might be the thing to break it.\nThe real conversation about affirmative consent is one about mutual desire, mutual pleasure and active rather than passive sexuality."}
