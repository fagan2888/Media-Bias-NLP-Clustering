Mark Green represents Tennessee\u2019s 22nd Senate District (Stewart, Houston and Montgomery counties) in the Tennessee General Assembly. (Photo: Submitted)\n\nGov. Bill Haslam\u2019s innovative plan to expand health insurance coverage for Tennessee\u2019s working poor, Insure Tennessee, is nowhere to be found on his 2016 legislative priorities, which is no surprise after the plan\u2019s ignominious treatment by the General Assembly last year.\n\nBut state Sen. Mark Green, R-Clarksville, has proposed an alternative plan that seems to be slowly gaining traction.\n\nIf it works, his plan would radically alter how health insurance is delivered to Tennessee\u2019s Medicaid (TennCare) recipients, and, Green proposes, be expanded to the more than 200,000 Tennesseans who currently don\u2019t qualify for TennCare, the population that would have been covered by the governor\u2019s plan.\n\nGreen\u2019s idea, which unanimously passed the Senate Health and Welfare Committee on Tuesday, is to create a flexible spending account for TennCare recipients that gives individuals an incentive to find low-cost heath care, that encourages healthy lifestyle choices and rewards TennCare recipients who save money.\n\n\u201cListen,\u201d Green said, \u201cwith the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid expansion we have essentially doubled down on a broken system. There are no incentives to lower costs, and without lower costs, any solution is going to ultimately fail.\n\n\u201cWe need to have more market competition,\u201d he asserts.\n\nFree market competition works\n\nGreen cites the dramatic reduction in the cost of laser vision correction surgery as an example of what market competition can do to medical prices.\n\n\u201cInsurance companies don\u2019t pay for Lasik,\u201d Green told the health and welfare committee on Jan. 12, \u201cand it used to cost $6,000 per eye to have the procedure. But because patients were paying the whole cost, they looked for lower-cost providers.\n\n\u201cBecause of competition, you can get Lasik for $600 an eye,\u201d Green stated. \u201cAnd ophthalmologists are doing fine.\u201d\n\nMy guess is that most ophthalmologists would prefer to charge $6,000 if they could, but Green has a point.\n\nAs long as your insurance co-pay is the same, patients are indifferent to the total cost of medical procedures.\n\n\u201cThere is no incentive for patients to care about lower costs,\u201d Green said. \u201cIf we could lower costs, we could offer more people TennCare coverage for the same amount of money.\u201d\n\nGreen\u2019s Senate Joint Resolution 88 proposes that the governor goes back to Health and Human Services and requests another Medicaid waiver for a pilot program that would test whether a \u201cfree-market\u201d lowers medical costs for TennCare participants.\n\nTennCare Opt Out\n\nGreen said the pilot program, called \u201cTennCare Opt Out,\u201d would be open to volunteers, which he hoped would number about 10,000, who receive TennCare benefits.\n\nThe volunteers would opt out of the existing TennCare plan and be placed in a catastrophic benefits health insurance program with premiums paid by TennCare, and they would receive an electronic benefits transfer (EBT) card to purchase primary health care services and medications.\n\nThe goal would be to have participants seek the best price and value for their health care services, and give health care providers immediate payment for services. The program would eliminate the need for a claims process and decrease overall costs.\n\nThe resolution proposed that \u201cthe physician, incentivized by the immediate payment and the alleviation of claims processing, could offer a price less than but not greater than the current reimbursement structure of the TennCare program.\u201d\n\nParticipants in the demonstration program would receive the money remaining on the EBT card at the end of the program year.\n\nTennCare spends more than $4,000 per participant in the current program, Green said. As an illustration of his proposal, the senator outlined this scenario:\n\n\u201cTo make the math easier,\u201d he said, \u201clet\u2019s assume that each participant in this program is credited with $5,000. The program would allocate $3,500 to pay the premium for catastrophic health care insurance, and the participant would get an EBT card with $1,500 on it to pay for doctor visits, test, and medications.\n\n\u201cWhatever is left of that $1,500 would be the participant\u2019s at the end of the year,\u201d Green said.\n\n\u201cSo there is a real incentive to find the least-expensive provider, the least-expensive medicine and to change his or her lifestyle to be healthier. I think this would work.\n\n\u201cAt least we should test it to see if that is true.\u201d\n\nWhat do we have to lose? Other than the governor\u2019s Insure Tennessee plan, no other proposals that help Tennessee\u2019s working poor have been offered.\n\nThe Senate Finance Committee is scheduled to vote on Green\u2019s resolution Tuesday, weather willing.\n\nReach Frank Daniels III at fdanielsiii@tennessean.com, 615-881-7039 or on Twitter @fdanielsiii.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/2016/01/23/insure-tennessee-alternative-passes-initial-hurdles/79225542/", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "With Insure Tennessee DOA, state Sen.
