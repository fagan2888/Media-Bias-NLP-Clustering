The six-year contract, which took effect July 1, 2013, was designed to provide more services at current costs, VDOT spokeswoman Marshall Herman said.\n\nLast year, anonymous complaints to the State Employee Fraud, Waste and Abuse Hotline alleged Serco wasn\u2019t fulfilling the contract.\n\nThe state\u2019s audit substantiated one charge: VDOT failed to fine Serco for incidents of nonperformance. The auditors didn\u2019t confirm claims that Serco\u2019s contract was being renegotiated for additional funding or that Serco employees were taking \u201cexcessive breaks\u201d from work.\n\nThe OIG audit, obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request, recommended VDOT \u201cresolve potential conflicts regarding responsibility for contract administration.\u201d\n\nThe confidential report \u2014 which cost $14,089 to conduct and was issued five months after its expected release date \u2014 also recommended \u201cdetermining the need for corrective action against select employee(s).\u201d No names were made public.\n\nA Dec. 30 VDOT memo stated that identified deficiencies were corrected or are in the process of being fixed.\n\nIn an email statement, Serco spokesman Alan Hill said, \u201cWe are enormously honored to serve Virginia motorists and support VDOT\u2019s innovative transportation operations.\n\n\u201cThe IG report did not find that the contract was renegotiated to provide additional funding, nor did it find that Safety Service Patrols were taking excessive breaks.\n\n\u201cAt all times, systems and processes were in place to ensure the safety of the motoring public was never compromised. The report did not identify any \u2018outstanding fines\u2019 nor did it recommend fines,\u201d Hill noted.\n\nRead more at Watchdog.org", "article_metadata": {"description": "A confidential audit found that the Virginia Department of Transportation wasted millions of tax dollars by failing to fine a nonperforming contractor.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A confidential audit found that the Virginia Department of Transportation wasted millions of tax dollars by failing to fine a nonperforming contractor.", "title": "Audit: Va.
