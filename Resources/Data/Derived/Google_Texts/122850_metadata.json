Story Highlights Senate committee votes 5-0 for the proposal\n\nBill crafted after 2013 shooting death in Toms River of a 6-year-old by 4-year-old\n\nPenalties for gun owners who don\u2019t properly secure weapons could reach 5 years in prison\n\nBill still has three legislative hurdles before it would reach Gov. Chris Christie\n\nNew Jersey lawmakers are looking to upgrade the penalties for allowing children access to loaded, unlocked firearms.\n\nThe bill, which a Senate committee advanced unanimously Thursday, was written in response to the April 2013 death of 6-year-old Brandon Holt of Toms River, who was accidentally shot in the head by a 4-year-old with a loaded .22-caliber rifle as they played.\n\nState law already requires gun owners to store loaded firearms in a locked container or secure location or secure them with a trigger lock if they reasonably should know a minor would likely have access to the weapon.\n\nNow, officials are considering stricter penalties. Currently, if an unsecured gun is used by a minor, it\u2019s a disorderly person\u2019s offense, punishable by up to six months in jail and a fine up to $1,000.\n\nUnder a proposal, it would be a fourth-degree crime carrying up to 18 months in prison and a $10,000 fine if an injury results or a third-degree crime punishable by 3 to 5 years and a $15,000 fine if death or serious injury results.\n\n\u201cHopefully, it may dissuade some people in the way that they treat their firearms,\u201d said bill sponsor Sen. James Holzapfel, R-Ocean.\n\nHolzapfel said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported nearly 800 children under age 14 were killed in gun accidents from 1999 to 2010.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so simple to me,\u201d Holzapfel said. \u201cI\u2019m a great supporter of people having the right to bear arms. I have weapons in my own home, but they\u2019re packed accordingly. At the end of the day, when you see the details of the tragedies that occur that don\u2019t have to occur, that\u2019s the purpose of the legislation.\u201d\n\nScott Bach, executive director of the Association of New Jersey Rifle and Pistol Clubs, asked unsuccessfully for the vote to be delayed.\n\n\u201cThese issues are not simple. Safe-storage laws are not always what they seem to be, and there is not a one-size-fits-all solution to the issue,\u201d Bach said. \u201cEvery household situation is different. You have urban areas with high crime. You have remote rural areas. Each family might have to make its own decision about what\u2019s appropriate, and New Jersey\u2019s law as it currently exists takes away that discretion.\u201d\n\nBach said the law should contain an exception for justifiable self-defense. He said the proposal isn\u2019t needed because prosecutors can use child endangerment and criminal negligence laws already on the books.\n\nThe father of the 4-year-old who killed Holt, Anthony Senatore, has been indicted on six counts of child endangerment for keeping various firearms unsecured and accessible to his children.\n\nMichael Symons: 609-984-4336; msymons@app.com\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.app.com/1ueXnYh", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "A New Jersey Senate committee voted unanimously for a bill that would increase the penalties faced by legal gun owners who allow children access to loaded, unsecured firearms.The idea came about after the 2013 shooting death of Brandon Holt, 6, by a 4-year-old with his father's rifle.", "og": {"site_name": "Asbury Park Press", "description": "A New Jersey Senate committee voted unanimously for a bill that would increase the penalties faced by legal gun owners who allow children access to loaded, unsecured firearms.The idea came about after the 2013 shooting death of Brandon Holt, 6, by a 4-year-old with his father's rifle.", "title": "Brandon Holt death leads to proposed stricter gun law", "url": "http://www.app.com/story/news/politics/new-jersey/2014/09/18/brandon-holt-nj-gun-penalties/15839735/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/app.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A New Jersey Senate committee voted unanimously for a bill that would increase the penalties faced by legal gun owners who allow children access to loaded, unsecured firearms.The idea came about after the 2013 shooting death of Brandon Holt, 6, by a 4-year-old with his father's rifle.", "creator": "@AsburyParkPress", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/610d6b05c7449c30dd2390e77bca4f9424fedcf5/c=0-48-245-293&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/AsburyPark/2014/09/18/-asbbrd06-01-2013pressmon1a00120130531img-asbbrd05-19-2013p11.jpg", "title": "Citing Brandon Holt's death, NJ may hike penalties for not securing guns", "site": "@AsburyParkPress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600068887", "fb": {"app_id": 116172675120111}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/mgsymons"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "nj guns, brandon holt, toms river shooting, nj gun laws, chris christie guns, anthony senatore, toms river child shooting"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdea96\"", "article_summary": "A New Jersey Senate committee voted to increase the penalties faced by legal gun owners who allow children access to loaded, unsecured firearms.\nCurrently, if an unsecured gun is used by a minor, it\u2019s a disorderly person\u2019s offense, punishable by up to six months in jail and a fine up to $1,000.\nChris ChristieNew Jersey lawmakers are looking to upgrade the penalties for allowing children access to loaded, unlocked firearms.\nHe said the proposal isn\u2019t needed because prosecutors can use child endangerment and criminal negligence laws already on the books.\nBrandon Holt, 6, victim of a gunshot fired by a 4-year-old neighbor."}
