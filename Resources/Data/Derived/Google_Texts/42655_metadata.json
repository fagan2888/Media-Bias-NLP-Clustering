Because as of late last Friday afternoon \u2014 when a Republican-led House committee admitted that disgraceful Republicans in Congress wasted two years and millions of taxpayer dollars investigating a Benghazi scandal largely of their own invention \u2014 conservatives desperately need to divert America's attention.\n\nIf not Mr. Gruber, they'll find some other diversion or, if necessary, create one out of whole cloth. Because they know enough gullible Americans will swallow the next bogus story fed to them as voraciously as they did Benghazi.\n\nBy now, the right's pattern of mendacious manipulation of the political media \u2014 the birther, ACORN, Shirley Sherrod and IRS \"scandals,\" plus Benghazi \u2014 ought to be abundantly clear. And save me the false equivalency claims about how NPR or MSNBC counterbalances Fox News and conservative talk radio; this is not about news commentary.\n\nRather, this is about the systematic manufacturing of bogus stories that dominate the national conversation in the first place. For this phenomenon, there is no balance: Suckers' news, as I call it, emanates almost exclusively from the right.\n\nIn the case of Shirley Sherrod, the late Andrew Breitbart published a selectively-edited videotape of an address given by Ms. Sherrod in which she recalls having to rethink her pre-existing assumption that a poor white farmer would automatically enjoy advantages black farmers might not.\n\nAlthough her speech was about the colorblind nature of poverty, that didn't prevent the scurrilous Mr. Breitbart from distorting her remarks to draw eyeballs to his website and create a bogus firestorm so hot the Obama administration rashly removed Ms. Sherrod from her federal job before later apologizing and offering to re-hire her.\n\nThen there's the absurdist \"reporting\" by self-styled conservative muckraker James O'Keefe. Costumed as a pimp and with a hidden camera in tow, Mr. O'Keefe secretly videotaped an interview with ACORN employees and then mendaciously edited their responses to create the impression that organization subsidized prostitution.\n\nSoon enough, the feds yanked ACORN's funding \u2014 which, as I calculated in a previous column, amounts to less than 60 seconds' worth of federal spending during the course of a 365-day fiscal year. But to the conservative media echo chamber, Mr. O'Keefe had exposed massive, budget-crippling (and yet again: race-motivated) fraud.\n\nThe IRS scandal? Yes, the IRS investigated whether some conservative groups may have wrongly claimed tax-exempt status as non-profits. But again, the initially-reported story was only half true: The IRS investigated liberal political groups, too.\n\nBefore dismissing these as merely examples of rumors traveling halfway around the world before the truth can lace its shoes, notice there are no liberal equivalents to Messrs. O'Keefe or Breitbart. And unlike the Benghazi-obsessed Republicans, Democrats never formed multiple congressional committees to investigate the 60 deaths that resulted from 13 separate attacks on U.S. embassies or consulates during the Bush Administration.\n\nNotice, too, that the primary political complaint of Benghazi-obsessed conservatives was that the tragic death of four American diplomats in Libya was intentionally covered up by Hillary Clinton's State Department and top Obama administration officials until after the 2012 election. So when did House Republicans release their Benghazi mea culpa report?\n\nLate on a Friday night, two weeks after the 2014 midterms. How perfect.\n\nAfter being suckered for two years into believing in the Benghazi non-story, perhaps it's time for some folks to pause at least a few minutes to ask themselves which stories or national conversations are being shelved in favor of suckers' news and commentary.\n\nThey might wonder, for example, how come they aren't familiar with these rarely-reported percentages: 9.8, 8.8, 8.4, 6.8, 4.1 and 2.9 percent. Those are \u2014 in order \u2014 the federal budgets deficits, as a share of GDP, during the first six years of the Obama administration.\n\nBut it's difficult to have a serious conversation about federal deficits with the steady, two-year drumbeat of Benghazi, Benghazi, Benghazi echoing in your ears. Mercifully, that noise should finally end \u2014 just in time for the Gruber, Gruber, Gruber throng to commence.\n\nSuckers beware.\n\nThomas F. Schaller teaches political science at UMBC.
