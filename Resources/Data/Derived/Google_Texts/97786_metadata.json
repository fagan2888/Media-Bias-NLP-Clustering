The report comes from ABC News affiliate WVEC in Virginia:\n\nIn both cases, people who gave their personal information to ObamaCare\u2019s train-wreck website, Healthcare.gov, were swiftly contacted by shady individuals who had somehow obtained their data, using caller-ID spoofing techniques to conceal their true identity. They claimed to be insurance providers looking to get more personal information from the targets so they could \u201chelp them find a plan.\u201d One of the targeted ObamaCare enrollees, Rich Guillory of Virginia Beach, reports the scammers were very persistent:\n\nGuillory signed up for a plan through the website on the marketplace. Just one day later, he started getting phone calls from two Virginia Beach numbers. The callers were asking if he needed help finding a plan. At the time, Guillory didn\u2019t have time to talk, but the calls kept coming. He remembers getting seven to eight calls. Finally, he called one of the numbers back and got a surprise. \u201cA lady answered the call and said \u2018I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about,'\u201d explains Guillory. He called the second number back and got another person, clueless as to what he was talking about. \u201cI was thinking at that time, this doesn\u2019t sound right at all,\u201d Guillory said. The next time he got a call, Guillory began to question the person on the other end. \u201cI told them, \u2018I tried to contact y\u2019all a couple times and this is not a legitimate number.\u2019 They hung up immediately,\u201d Guillory explained. That led to a flood concerns for Guillory, who now wondered how the mystery person got his personal information. He feels it has to be connected to signing up for insurance on HealthCare.gov. \u201cHas to be. There\u2019s no other way for those people to have known that I was looking for insurance,\u201d Guillory said.\n\nPrepare to be reclassified as a meaningless \u201canecdote\u201d by the Administration, Mr. Guillory! Unless, of course, you\u2019re already a meaningless anecdote because you had insurance that you liked, but ObamaCare killed it. You can\u2019t get much less important to Barack Obama than that.\n\nA cyber-security expert interviewed by WVEC News allowed that it was possible this was an early example of data theft from Healthcare.gov, or it might have just been a coincidence, despite Guillory\u2019s conviction that he couldn\u2019t have come to the scammers\u2019 attention any other way. (Less is known about the other victim described in the report, who wished to remain anonymous.) The security consultant also laid out some surprising stakes for the scam artists, saying that health care data is actually much more valuable than stolen credit card numbers, because \u201ca criminal will use it to get insurance, use it to buy drugs, which can then be resold on the street.\u201d\n\nNaturally, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services assures us all is well, and security is impenetrable, even before they\u2019ve made an effort to investigate the claims relayed by WVEC:\n\nWhen consumers fill out their online Marketplace applications, they can trust that the information that they are providing is protected by stringent security standards. To date, there have been no successful security attacks on healthcare.gov and no person or group has maliciously accessed personally identifiable information from the site\u2026 Security testing is conducted on an ongoing basis using industry best practices to appropriately safeguard consumers\u2019 personal information. The security of the system is also monitored by sensors and other tools to deter and prevent any unauthorized access.\n\nI\u2019d feel better about those assurances if they were actually required to inform the public about security attacks, but of course they\u2019re not. Also, one of the big security concerns surrounding the badly-written Healthcare.gov site is that hackers would hijack data at the point of entry, by slipping malware into the thick stew of plugins and scripts that pour into your computer when you log in. The information needed by these phone scammers could have been skimmed that way, without actually hacking into any secure databases. There are a lot of possibilities to be investigated before these Virginia Beach incidents are either taken as proof of an immediate crisis, or written off as nothing. Also, we might ask: if only a few people have thus far reported the scam, how many others might have fallen for it \u2013 especially if, unlike Mr. Guillory, they were confused, or ran into system errors, and were thus unable to complete the signup process successfully?", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Human Events", "description": "Coincidence, false alarm... or tip of the iceberg?", "title": "ObamaCare identity theft reported in Virginia | Human Events", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://humanevents.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/187238639-480x320.jpg", "url": "http://humanevents.com/2014/02/05/obamacare-identity-theft-reported-in-virginia/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"pages": 212436860202}, "description": "Coincidence, false alarm... or tip of the iceberg?", "twitter": {"site": "@humanevents", "image": "http://humanevents.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/187238639-480x320.jpg", "description": "Coincidence, false alarm... or tip of the iceberg?", "card": "summary", "creator": "@@Doc_0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1369\"", "article_summary": "There\u2019s no other way for those people to have known that I was looking for insurance,\u201d Guillory said.\nThat led to a flood concerns for Guillory, who now wondered how the mystery person got his personal information.\nUnless, of course, you\u2019re already a meaningless anecdote because you had insurance that you liked, but ObamaCare killed it.\nJust one day later, he started getting phone calls from two Virginia Beach numbers.\nThe information needed by these phone scammers could have been skimmed that way, without actually hacking into any secure databases."}
