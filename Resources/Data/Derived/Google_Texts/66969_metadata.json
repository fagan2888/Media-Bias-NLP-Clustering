In both cases, the companies were alleged to have engaged in clear-cut violations: Flambeau was accused of cancelling the medical insurance of an employee who didn\u2019t particulate in a wellness program, and Orion is alleged to have fired an employee who objected to health screenings.\n\nBut when the EEOC\u2019s Chicago office sued corporate giant Honeywell International Inc. on Oct. 27 on similar grounds, alarm bells were sounded. Honeywell\u2019s CEO, David M. Cote, is a member of the Business Roundtable, and sits on its executive leadership committee.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to overestimate the amount of anxiety that this EEOC action has caused,\u201d said Gretchen K. Young, senior vice president of health policy at the ERISA Industry Committee in Washington, D.C. Honeywell operates \u201ca relatively mainstream wellness program. People said, \u2018Are you kidding me?\u2019 \u201d\n\nWellness programs, at the employer level, use a variety of carrots and sticks to motivate employees to lose weight, quit smoking and take their own health more seriously, in hopes of keeping the workforce healthier and reducing corporate health claims. Most programs include some combination of medical physicals, biometric screenings, smoking cessation incentives, at-work flu shots and weight-loss programs, and wellness quizzes meant to show employees how lifestyle choices affect their own health.\n\nThe programs have proliferated in recent years because the Affordable Care Act permitted employers to use financial incentives \u2014 gift cards, higher premiums, extra cash in health savings accounts \u2014 in order to secure participation in such programs.\n\nAs of 2014, by way of the ACA most employers are permitted to steer up to 30 percent of the total amount of employees\u2019 health insurance premiums toward wellness \u201cincentives.\u201d Another 20 percent can be added to the mix if companies try to prevent or reduce tobacco use, meaning as much as 50 percent of employees\u2019 premiums could be at stake, depending on their participation.\n\nThat could amount to hundreds or even thousands of dollars a year in penalties and incentives.\n\nThat Obamacare permitted those incentive programs and allowed companies some leeway in how those carrots and sticks are deployed is one of the reasons large U.S. companies have been on board with the Affordable Care Act, even though there wasn\u2019t much in it for them besides extra paperwork.\n\n\u201cLarge employers have been somewhat upset that the ACA hasn\u2019t really panned out the way they were hoping,\u201d Ms. Young said. But \u201cthey\u2019re still good soldiers,\u201d and haven\u2019t badmouthed the ACA the way many small and mid-sized businesses have.\n\n\u201cThen to have this happen, it really has been upsetting ... This suit of Honeywell struck an inflamed nerve with businesses,\u201d she said.\n\nLarge companies with relatively generous health benefits packages also hope to use wellness programs as a way to blunt the potential impact of the ACA\u2019s so-called \u201cCadillac tax,\u201d which penalizes companies for health plans that cost more than $10,200 for individual premiums, and $27,500 for families, starting in 2018. The excise tax is to be paid by health insurers, but those costs will passed down to employers and employees, unless employers can find a way to keep policy costs in check.\n\nWellness plans such as Honeywell\u2019s are supposed to do just that.\n\n\u201cWellness is one of the levers to reduce the [cost of] health care,\u201d said Steve Wojcik, vice president of public policy at the National Business Group on Health. \u201cThe conflicting messages that are being sent by the government on employer-sponsored wellness programs\u201d is concerning to businesses.\n\nThe conflict is based in the nature of the Honeywell suit: The EEOC claims that Honeywell is violating the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act by compelling employees to submit to health screenings and blood tests. Participation for employees and their spouses is optional, but up to $4,000 could be at stake for those who decline to participate: the loss of up to $1,500 in health savings account contributions from Honeywell, a $500 surcharge applied to health plan costs, a $1,000 \u201ctobacco surcharge\u201d (because Honeywell assumes those who don\u2019t submit to a biometric screening are smokers), plus another $1,000 tobacco fee for a spouse who doesn\u2019t participate.\n\nWith penalties so high, what is technically a voluntary plan acts a lot like a compulsory one. But Honeywell says the fees fall within the range prescribed by the Affordable Care Act.\n\nIn November, a judge agreed with Honeywell, and rejected the EEOC\u2019s attempt to shut down the wellness program. The federal lawsuit, however, remains in effect.\n\nThe issue will flare more often as companies get more aggressive, and punitive, with wellness programs and health screenings. Last year, for example, Penn State University spiked a controversial plan to charge employees $100 a month if they refused to submit to a battery of health care screenings.\n\nSo far, the Honeywell suit is the only objectionable one filed by the EEOC, business groups say. But U.S. firms are firing a warning shot regardless, and rallying to Honeywell\u2019s defense, in hopes of receiving more guidance from the Obama administration and heading off future action from the EEOC. Notably, Ms. Young said, all of the complaints originated from the EEOC\u2019s Chicago office, and the Honeywell suit was not instigated by the full EEOC board of commissioners, but rather by attorneys in Chicago.\n\nWithout a bright line separating what\u2019s a voluntary wellness program and what is compulsory, it\u2019s hard to know who\u2019s safe.\n\n\u201cIf it can pop up against Honeywell, it can pop up against anybody,\u201d Ms. Young said.\n\nIt\u2019s up to the EEOC to draw that bright line, but it hasn\u2019t, despite promises to issue regulations earlier this year, said Mr. Fischer, the Milwaukee attorney. EEOC commissioners now say they plan to issue wellness plan regulations some time in 2015.\n\nUntil then, employers, insurers and human resources attorneys will have to wait and see how EEOC interprets the various workplace and medical privacy laws already in effect, enforced through the U.S. Department of Labor and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act.\n\n\u201cDifferent federal agencies are giving what appears to be conflicting advice,\u201d Mr. Fischer said. \u201cIt\u2019s like trying to play pin the tail on the donkey.\u201d\n\nDespite the noise coming from CEO groups, Mr. Fischer said he doubts big businesses are really preparing to do battle with Obamacare, and he also acknowledged that the EEOC has a difficult job: Trying to protect worker privacy in an era when employers want more health data information about their employees.\n\n\u201cI know people are upset. Are they upset enough to tear down an [unrelated] piece of legislation? I just don\u2019t think that\u2019s productive,\u201d he said. \u201cI don't think vilifying the EEOC here is the right approach.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The EEOC sued Honeywell saying\u00a0its programs violate federal law by compelling employees to submit to health screenings and blood tests.", "og": {"site_name": "Pittsburgh Post-Gazette", "description": "Major U.S. corporations and business lobbying groups have grown audibly critical of the Obama administration\u2019s workplace discrimination enforcers, who have \u201cstruck an inflamed nerve\u201d by challenging the legality of corporate wellness programs.
