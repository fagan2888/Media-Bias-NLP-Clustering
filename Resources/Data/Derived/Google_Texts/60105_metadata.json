One is a sufferer, the other a surgeon. Until recently they were strangers, but a London-based networking group brought them together in the wake of a campaign that has now attracted the support of Afghanistan\u2019s First Lady.\n\nWhen a Kabul mob turned on a devout young woman and publicly beat her to death, the world was shocked; Farkhunda\u2019s murder in March was frenzied, brutal and barbaric. Yet every year hundreds of Afghan women are killed by a stealthy, silent killer that attracts no international protest.\n\nIt is breast cancer, a disease that goes undetected and largely untreated in a country where routine screening is impossible and timely treatment, rare. Those lucky enough to be diagnosed while there is still hope have to go abroad to get specialist treatment.\n\nShinkai Karokhail, was one of them. The 53-year-old mother of four had to leave her home in Kabul, pay for treatment, undergo a double mastectomy and aggressive chemo/radiotherapy to save her life. She is still recovering, but Shinkai knows she is \u2018one of the lucky ones\u2019.\n\nShe is also an MP and one of the very few Afghan women willing to talk openly about this taboo subject. \u201cEven friends and educated people don\u2019t want me to mention it, but I think now it is time to speak out and take steps to raise awareness and fight against cancer.\u201d\n\nShinkai did more than talk; she initiated a breast cancer awareness campaign, picked-up and implemented by the Afghan Ministry of Public Health: \u201cWe founded a \u2018Let\u2019s Fight Against Cancer\u2019 group to advocate for a cancer centre, and I invited the First Lady (Mrs. Rula Ghani) to lend her voice and support.\u201d\n\nThree and a half thousand miles away, another Afghan woman is fighting breast cancer, but in a very different way. Dr Zarghuna Taraki specialises in treating the disease at University College Hospital, in London although, like Shinkai, she was born in Kabul. The parliamentarian and the clinician have never met and live very different lives \u2013 but they are both Afghan women, both mothers and both passionately committed to tackling a disease that is needlessly killing thousands of people in their country\n\nZarghuna, whose UK patients have access to excellent treatment, said, \u201cCancer is a dark area in Afghanistan \u2013 not only breast cancer but all cancer \u2013 there is certainly no comprehensive awareness campaign. I was talking to some ladies back home and they asked me questions such as \u2018Is it possible that a breast can develop a disease?\u2019\n\n\u201cMost women in Afghanistan look to other women, their friends and families, for information. In the villages especially I don\u2019t think they have any knowledge about the meaning of breast lumps or breast cancer \u2013 so they die without ever knowing the reason. This is very sad but it also makes it harder to learn how widespread breast cancer is when causes of death are unknown.\u201d\n\nBreast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide \u2013 it accounts for about 12% percent of all new cancers and 25% of all cancers in women.\u201d\n\n(The former Head of Kabul\u2019s Malalai Hospital, Dr Nasrin Oriakhil (now Minister for Labour, Social Affairs, Martyrs and Disabled) was once quoted as saying, \u201cThere are no precise statistics for breast cancer in Afghanistan; however, we know that there are many patients. Just looking at our hospital, five of our employees have breast cancer and they do not have access to proper treatment.\u201d)\n\nWe are sitting in a London caf\u00e9, not far from Warren Street tube station, doing what women the world over do \u2013 drink coffee, chatter and share cakes. Zarghuna, who speaks four languages, is telling me about her own struggle simply to practice as a breast cancer physician.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to say why I became a doctor but I know that I really do want to help people, especially as, for women in Afghanistan you know, it\u2019s not easy for them . . . but I never imagined that I would end up in the UK working as a doctor.\n\n\u201cMy childhood was very colourful! I grew up in a big family \u2013 five brothers and a sister. My family was always supportive of me studying and my mother and father always told me that education was vital. Three of my cousins are doctors. We lived in Kabul but went on holiday to villages so I experienced city and rural life. Unfortunately the situation in Afghanistan got worse . . . so it was not such a hard thing for me to leave.\u201d\n\nZarghuna qualified as a doctor in Moscow, returning home to work as an obstetrician/gynaecologist.\n\n\u201cBut once again the situation in Afghanistan deteriorated and I fled the country. I came to the UK in 1998 with my small family, consisting of my husband and 18-month-old daughter.\u201d\n\nWith only a few words of English and their old life gone Zarghuna and her husband had to pick up the pieces and start over. He had been a lawyer. She had been a doctor. It was a low point, but she recalls her husband\u2019s words with a smile: \u201cHe said to me you still ARE a doctor!\u201d\n\nWorking as a driver to support the family, her husband insisted that she fight to practice medicine again.\n\n\u201cI went to college to learn basic English, then intermediate, followed by high-level English for academic purposes. It was hard, because around this time I also had my second child.\u201d\n\nWith the tenacity and courage of so many Afghan women Zarghuna passed her English exams and went on, once more, to qualify as a doctor, working her way up through a variety of clinical attachments, learning about health priorities and rising expectations about cancer treatment.\n\nClearly a compassionate and highly intelligent woman, Zarghuna cares deeply about her British patients, but part of her is always in Afghanistan, where things are very different, as Dr Karokhail discovered.\n\n\u201cI have tremendous respect for Shinkai Karokhail and what she has done,\u201d says Zarghuna, \u201cbecause it is not easy to speak about these things publicly there.\u201d\n\nWhen NATO formally ended its commitment to Afghanistan, after 13 years of conflict, the country that had dominated Western news channels for over a decade, slowly slipped off the international radar. \u201cOur Afghan partners can and will take the fight from here,\u201d said Commander ISAF, General John F Campbell at the departure ceremony. He was referring to insurgency and drugs, but in fact there were many other battles to be fought, against a background of shattered infrastructure and political uncertainty.\n\nFormer Medical Director of Kabul\u2019s CURE International Hospital, Dr Jacqui Sinclair, left Afghanistan with her husband Eric in 2008 but remained in contact with colleagues. She welcomed the news that initiatives were afoot to tackle breast cancer adding, \u201cIt\u2019s hard for Afghan women to qualify as doctors and they are almost exclusively working as paediatricians or in obstetrics/gynaecology. As it is not \u2018appropriate\u2019 for women to see male doctors, and there are no female breast surgeons, the situation is very depressing.\u201d\n\nAfter ISAF troops left, many NGO and charity workers followed. Foreign doctors who brought expertise increasingly became targets and several known to the Sinclairs were attacked and killed after they left.\n\nCurrently there are no public information campaigns about self-examination, or the screening programmes that would enable early detection and less invasive surgery; nor are there dedicated treatment facilities where the psychological and physical aspects of breast cancer treatment can be delivered side by side.\n\nAfghanistan is a vast, landlocked country \u2013 extremely poor and heavily dependent on foreign aid. Its savage beauty may be breathtaking, but without a safe, effective transport network to traverse its challenging terrain, communities are isolated in every sense of the word. For women, denied the socio-economic freedoms of men, it is worse. Solutions that would work in more developed countries are irrelevant in Afghanistan where access and security challenges obviate even the deployment of mobile screening units.\n\nBut for a woman suffering from breast cancer, what happens on the global stage is an irrelevance. Her world shrinks to one circumscribed by diagnosis, prognosis and fear. The outlook for sufferers is bleak as Shinkai, despite her education, status and tenacity, discovered.\n\nConscious that she was an age group that elsewhere warranted routine breast screening she went to India for a mammogram. \u201cWe (in Afghanistan) have no such facility or system to take care of our health. In the beginning I was told that there was \u2018some calcification\u2019 but a later ultrasound result showed that all was normal.\u201d\n\nStill Shinkai had a feeling that something was amiss. \u201cI felt I had the beginning of a cancer and a few months later I suddenly found that my left breast had changed in size a lot. I went to a doctor and, after a very unprofessional examination; she told me that nothing was wrong. \u2018You are absolutely fine\u2019 she said. I tried to convince her that I was sick but she refused to accept it.\u201d\n\nPressed about the change in breast size Shinkai\u2019s doctor said it was due to breast-feeding \u2013 13 years earlier!\n\n\u201cThree months later, I went to the US and while there my nipple started bleeding. My friend, who is doctor, sent me for mammogram and ultrasound.\u201d\n\nOn 8th October 2013, in the USA, she was diagnosed with aggressive, Stage 3 breast cancer and too ill, according to the American doctors, to go back to India for treatment.\n\nFor Shinkai the news that she was out of options was a heavy blow. \u201cI felt like all patients, especially women, but the most depressing part was when I was told they had to remove both my breasts. It is difficult for a women to lose part of her body.\u201d\n\nSadly, that wasn\u2019t all she\u2019d had to contend with. \u201cThe worst part was when the hospital refused to do my test because of the fee. I had to get money from family and friends. It was difficult to get money from Afghanistan. With help from the Afghan Embassy and an NGO this was eventually resolved.\n\n\u201cOne of the women\u2019s organisations which has an office in the US called Women for Afghan Women helped me to get money through their account. Everyone sent me a financial contribution toward my treatments \u2013 family, friends, members of civil society and government.\n\n\u201cChemotherapy was the worst. Each stage was very painful but when I was passing through difficult times I thought of cancer patients in Afghanistan, especially those who had no money to pay for treatment and just had to wait to die. When I thought about them, I really understood how lucky I was.\u201d\n\nSo what, realistically, can happen? And how quickly?\n\nSoon after the London-based Afghan Women\u2019s Support Forum started its social media activity about breast cancer the CEO of Alem Health, Mr Aschkan Abdul-Malek, got in touch. He wrote, \u201cOur company provides high quality diagnoses for mammograms in Afghanistan through a network of over 400 US, EU, and India-based radiologists. There are plenty of facilities that perform mammograms in Kabul, but awareness on the part of patients is limited, and healthcare spending on screening and preventative care is quite low in general. The breast cancer cases we do see are all Stage 3 or Stage 4, whereas we\u2019d like to diagnose things much earlier.\u201d\n\nHe claimed that the problem was compounded by poor standards of service delivered by local radiologists and technicians. \u201cWhen we first go into a facility, the images being taken by the technicians are often of unacceptable quality for diagnostic use, but we know somewhere a radiologist or someone else has been reading them, so we work with the technicians to get their skills to a global standard so our radiologists can confidently diagnose.\n\n\u201cA mammogram costs about $30 US for a facility to take. We charge a little less, in addition to having an Indian, European, or American doctor read it, usually within three hours. We don\u2019t charge for any of the IT infrastructure, we\u2019re fully private sector and work with private sector hospitals, so unlike aid projects, our entire budget for a year is a fraction of the cost of a Land Cruiser!\u201d\n\nBut is an internet-based service really of significant value? Afghanistan\u2019s living standards are among the lowest in the world so paying for anything \u2013 diagnosis, treatment or aftercare \u2013 will put help beyond the reach of most women.\n\nThe good news is that in October 2014, something unprecedented happened; the country\u2019s new First Lady, Mrs Rula Ghani, accepted Shinkai\u2019s invitation to support the breast cancer campaign she had initiated.\n\nIn terms of credibility, that public commitment by the president\u2019s wife was a game changer. Now, through the continuous efforts of Shinkai Karokhail and the First Lady\u2019s Advisor on Health Affairs, Fawzia Alam, a variety of key players have started working together on cancer control. What was initially a loose alliance soon developed into the Afghanistan Cancer Control Coalition (ACCC).\n\nIts co-ordinator, Dr Maihan Abdullah, said from Kabul, \u201cThe ACCC is an extraordinary alliance of organisations and individuals committed to working for cancer prevention and control. The political commitment alongside ACCC has given its members new hope in the fight against cancer. In a meeting with H.E. First Lady and the Health Minister, ACCC convinced the Minister to form a Technical Committee consisting of members from ACCC and the Ministry.\n\n\u201cIt decided that a Cancer Centre was urgently needed and that efforts should be started as soon as possible for its establishment. ACCC members \u2013 a variety of public health specialist, midwives and surgeons \u2013 vowed to provide their expertise voluntarily in the proposed facility and, in subsequent meetings, Dr. Zarghuna will participate from the UK, through Skype, to offer her recommendations.\u201d\n\nTHE AFGHAN WOMEN\u2019S SUPPORT FORUM\n\nThe Afghan Women\u2019s Support Forum, a UK-based networking group is trying to focus attention on the issue. Its eclectic membership, a loose alliance of individuals with an interest in Afghanistan and its women, was brought together by Baroness Fiona Hodgson.\n\nFiona, whose first visit to the country was nearly her last, escaped death by hiding in a wardrobe during the siege of the Intercontinental Hotel in 2011. But she has been back since and, like all members of AWSF, is conscious of how big a divide there is between what western women can expect when serious illness strikes and what happens in Afghanistan.\n\nShe said, \u201cThe group relies on its membership to provide intelligence about what issues are of most importance to Afghan women. We don\u2019t want them to be forgotten. When Zarghuna told us about the lack of provision for identifying and treating breast cancer, and the human tragedies associated with that, it became a priority for us. I have several friends in the UK who have had breast cancer and it was further personalised for me because I know Shinkai, so this dreadful disease had a \u2018human face\u2019.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Dr Zarghuna Taraki by Glyn Strong A killer disease has united two women living 3,500 miles apart.
