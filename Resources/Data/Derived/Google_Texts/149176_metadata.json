Here, in my home,\u201d said Moore, a Dominican immigrant who can\u2019t afford to leave her rent-controlled apartment in northern Manhattan\u2019s Washington Heights.\n\nHer neighborhood is among the most rat-infested in New York City, along with West Harlem, Chinatown, the Lower East Side and the South Bronx. They are the focus of the city\u2019s latest effort to attack a rat population that some experts estimate could be double that of the Big Apple\u2019s 8.4 million people.\n\nStarting next month, the city\u2019s 45 inspectors will be bolstered by nine new employees of a pilot program to tackle the vermin in chronically infested neighborhoods where rats have resisted repeated efforts to eradicate them.\n\nSpecific targets are rat reservoirs such as parks, sewers, dumping areas and subways where they congregate and breed. The idea is to tamp down the population where it is strongest and keep it from spreading.\n\n\u201cRats burrow and live in colonies,\u201d Health Commissioner Mary Bassett told the City Council at a hearing last month. \u201cI\u2019ll sometimes imagine when I walk through a park, if I could have sort of a \u2018rat vision,\u2019 there are all these tunnels under there that are occupied by rats. And from there the rats fan out.\u201d\n\nFinanced with $611,000 in the current city budget, inspectors will work with neighborhood associations, community boards, elected officials and building owners to plug up holes and put poison in rodent tunnels.\n\nFor years, inspectors responding to complaints on the city\u2019s 311 hotline have already been searching for rats and their telltale signs: burrows, droppings, claw marks and gnawed holes. Besides traps and poison, the city also has used contraceptives to curb the rats.\n\nNew York\u2019s Rat Information Portal \u2014 or, appropriately, RIP \u2014 is an interactive online map that tracks Health Department violations, with searches by borough, address, block number and ZIP code. Spots marked red are deemed to be rat-infested; those in yellow have passed inspection.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rodents winning NY rat race, but humans fight back", "title": "Rodents winning NY rat race, but humans fight back", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Rodents winning NY rat race, but humans fight back", "title": "Rodents winning NY rat race, but humans fight back", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/15/rodents_winning_ny_rat_race_but_humans_fight_back/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/nyc-rat-crackdown.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Rodents winning NY rat race, but humans fight back", "title": "Rodents winning NY rat race, but humans fight back", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/nyc-rat-crackdown.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Verena Dobnik", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcf79\"", "article_summary": "Her neighborhood is among the most rat-infested in New York City, along with West Harlem, Chinatown, the Lower East Side and the South Bronx.\nThey are the focus of the city\u2019s latest effort to attack a rat population that some experts estimate could be double that of the Big Apple\u2019s 8.4 million people.\nSpecific targets are rat reservoirs such as parks, sewers, dumping areas and subways where they congregate and breed.\nBesides traps and poison, the city also has used contraceptives to curb the rats.\n\u201cRats burrow and live in colonies,\u201d Health Commissioner Mary Bassett told the City Council at a hearing last month."}
