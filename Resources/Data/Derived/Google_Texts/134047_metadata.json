MOC spending makes up about 27 percent of federal spending on the $430 billion-a-year program. Last year, Medicaid covered a total of 72 million Americans.\n\nMedicaid recipients getting care through MCO\u2019s are growing at an increasingly fast rate. As the baby boom ages in to nursing homes and other dependent care, this could become a fiscal crisis. The more the MCO system is used, the more the auditors say it will be vulnerable to fraud since \u201cneither the federal nor state governments are \u201cwell positioned to identify improper payments\u201d due to the \u201csize and diversity\u201d of program.\n\nRelated: U.S. Health Care: Worst Bang For Your Buck\n\nThey suggested that it\u2019s likely to get worse now that 25 states have expanded their Medicaid programs under the Affordable Care Act, with several more states likely to follow suit. Under the law, states that expand Medicaid receive 100 percent reimbursement rate from the federal government for managed care organizations for the next two years.\n\nGAO said that because state and federal governments have recovered \"only a small portion\" of the wrongly paid money, they should ramp up their oversight of the managed care organizations or even more Medicare dollars will be \u201cvulnerable to improper payments.\u201d\n\nRight now, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services requires states to audit their managed care payments, however they are not required to audit the \u201cappropriateness\u201d of these payments.\n\nAccording to the GAO, states have not begun to closely examine program integrity in Medicaid\u2019s managed care. The auditors say they should start.\n\nMedicaid is hardly alone in making billions in improper payments each year. In 2013, Medicare\u2019s Private Fee-For-Service Plans overpaid $34.6 billion to billers. And a 2012 report from the Office of Management and Budget estimated that the federal government as a whole pays about $100 billion in improper payments each year.\n\nTop Reads from the Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The federal and state governments are struggling to keep track of payments made throug", "title": "Medicaid Money Wasted in 2013: $14.4 Billion", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/06/23/Medicaid-Money-Wasted-2013-144-Billion", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/07292013_Dollar_Signs_Map_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/06/23/Medicaid-Money-Wasted-2013-144-Billion", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/07292013_Dollar_Signs_Map_article.jpg", "creator": "@Briannaehley", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The federal and state governments are struggling to keep track of payments made throug", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Currently about 50 million people receive benefits through managed care organizations instead of the traditional fee-for-service method where providers are paid for each service.\nThe federal and state governments are struggling to keep track of payments made through Medicaid\u2019s managed care program\u2014which resulted in at least $14.4 billion in improper payments last year.\nUnder the law, states that expand Medicaid receive 100 percent reimbursement rate from the federal government for managed care organizations for the next two years.\nMedicaid is hardly alone in making billions in improper payments each year.\nAnd a 2012 report from the Office of Management and Budget estimated that the federal government as a whole pays about $100 billion in improper payments each year."}
