MINNEAPOLIS (WCCO) — From St. Paul paying tribute to Bob Dylan to cheap holiday travel, here are the four stories to know for Monday, Oct. 5.

SUPCO’s New Term

The U.S. Supreme Court begins its new term Monday and talk about a case of déjà vu: The high court is expected to make a decision on the Affordable Care Act’s “contraceptive mandate.”

Other cases on the docket: Rulings on affirmative action, public employee union fees and, as always, class-action lawsuits and death penalty appeals.



Holiday Travel

Planning on traveling for the holidays? Then get out your credit card now.

According to the travel website, Orbitz, today through Oct. 12 is the best time to buy fares for Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year’s Eve.

It might seem a little early, but Orbitz says ticket prices will be at least 5 percent below average this week.

Bob Dylan Street

First, it was a mural. Now, it’s a whole street.

St. Paul is the latest city to pay tribute to Minnesota’s own, Bob Dylan.

Monday, the city will officially co-name a portion of 4th Street near the new CHS Field ballpark to “Positively 4th Street.”

It’s a play on the 1965 Dylan hit of the same name.

Free Grateful Dead Tickets

The band will be giving away 10,000 free tickets to a special show at Madison Square Garden in New York City on Nov. 7. John Mayer will also be joining them.

It’s part of a new music series being backed by American Express. Fans can enter to win two tickets Monday through Thursday.
