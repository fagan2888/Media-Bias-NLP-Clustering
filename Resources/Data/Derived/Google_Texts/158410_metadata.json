More photos and video: dailycamera.com (Cliff Grassmick / Staff Photographer)\n\nAs far as competitive races go, Abby Levene is not at all unfamiliar to them.\n\nIt had been a long while, though, since she was able to gear up for a triathlon. And with the daunting Old Stage Road part of Sunday's Boulder Peak Triathlon course, there was a little anxiety for the University of Colorado grad student.\n\nTurned out, that was her favorite stretch of the course, and getting over that hump helped her end up as the race's fastest female competitor in the event owned by Life Time Fitness and part of the Life Time Tri Series.\n\n\"This is my first triathlon in four years, my first Olympic distance, and my first at altitude, so yeah I was just a little bit nervous,\" Levene said after coming into the finish line with a top time of 2 hours, 19 minutes, 2 seconds. \"Old Stage, I thought that was going to kill me, but I actually loved it.\n\n\"I was pleasantly surprised, and there is no better place to do a triathlon than in Boulder.\"\n\nLevene, 24, has run all her life, including participating in track and cross country at Princeton University (she owns a school record in the 10,000 meter run). The past two years, she has been a member of CU's cross country and track teams.\n\nHaving been in the Boulder area the past couple years, she was familiar with the area around Boulder Reservoir, where this year's race returned in full. But she was still caught a little by surprise when she got on her bike Sunday morning.\n\nHer biking didn't set her back, but she certainly put herself into contention on the strength of her feet during the 6.2-mile run. She finished with the top split in the 10K, coming in at 36:13.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I thought we went up Old Stage the other direction, so I practiced going up a couple times that way,\" Levene said. \"When we got on the bikes, it was like, 'oh, no,' ... it actually might have been a little easier than the way I was practicing. I've ran out here a lot, but I had never done the whole thing at once.\"\n\nBiking was the strength for the men's overall winner, Brazilian Santiago Ascenco, and the women's elite winner, Lindsey Knast of Lafayette.\n\nBrazil's Santiago Ascenco crosses the finish line on Sunday at the Boulder Peak Triathlon. More photos and video: dailycamera.com (Cliff Grassmick / Staff Photographer)\n\nAscenco arrived from his hometown of Goiania, just outside of Brasilia, two days ago, and despite having competed in the Boulder Peak Triathlon a couple years ago, the altitude still had it's affects.\n\nNot enough, however, to sway the results, as the former Ironman Brazil winner finished in 2:03.41.\n\nWith a heavy schedule ahead of him, Ascenco plans on staying in Boulder for a couple weeks to train. He said winning this version of the race is a pleasant start.\n\n\"It's a tough course, and I like that,\" Ascenco said. \"I love to race and train here. This is my fourth time in the city and it's perfect for racing and training, and now there are a lot of (elite athletes) here, so there's a lot of inspiration.\n\n\"I brought some friends here from Brazil, and so I'll have some company to train with, and I hope this is just a good start to the rest of the season.\"\n\nKnast, originally from Philadelphia, was the first female to cross the finish line in the morning, and she did so in 2:25.42. With just a few elite racers on the women's side, the likelihood of age-group participants finishing with faster times was better, and Knast finished fourth overall among females.\n\nYet as she crossed the finish line, she had a smile on her face and arms raised high above her head for coming in strong. She was the fastest female biker with a split of 1:11.32 for the 26-mile ride, and she'll be looking to qualify for the Kona Ironman World Championships for a third time later this summer.\n\n\"I took the run a lot easier than I would have,\" Knast said after temperatures rose rather quickly during the morning. \"The bike course was a little different and a lot harder, but my strength is climbing and I figured I'd have an advantage.\"\n\nThis was the first year that Life Time Media and Events \u2014 a division of Life Time Fitness \u2014 has owned the Boulder Peak Triathlon, although they are in partnership with Ironman called the \"Commit to Tri\" program.\n\nOverall, there were more than 600 entrants in 2015. Louisville's Jared Milam and Boulder's Yoni Doron-Peters finished second and third, respectively, in the men's division, while Stephanie Popelar of Parker and Colleen De Reuck of Boulder finished second and third in the women's division.\n\nThis year's race did not offer prize money, but that was something that will be considered in the future, Boulder Peak brand manager Scott Fliegelman said.\n\n\"It's not out of the question, but this year the Life Time Tri series including this Boulder race, we're just putting more emphasis and focus on the age-group experience,\" Fliegelman said. \"Our number one thing this morning was getting everyone out of the water safely, and everyone off the bikes safely, and I think we did that. I think the athletes are enjoying the race, with it being a medium-sized event.\"\n\nAdam Dunivan: dunivana@dailycamera.com or twitter.com/AdamDunivan24\n\nBoulder Peak Triathlon\n\nMen's top 20\n\n1.
