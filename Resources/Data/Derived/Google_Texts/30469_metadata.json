The Drudge Report threw up a giant headline, \u201cSIGN UP: 1-800-FUCKYO,\u201d beneath a Photoshopped picture of Barack Obama holding the bell of a stethoscope. The headline linked to a Daily Caller item, published several hours prior, about Healthcare.gov\u2019s toll-free hotline, which is 1-800-318-2596. These numbers, associate editor Katie McHugh wrote, correspond to 1-800-FUCKYO. Sort of.\n\nNeed health insurance? The Obama administration has you covered. Simply dial 1-800-FUCKYO to reach the next available health-care provider. ... 1-800-3(F) 8(U) 2(C) 5(K) 9(Y) 6(O). That\u2019s 1-800-FUCKYO.\n\nHere is an exquisite artifact of conservative journalism: a free-floating anti-Obama meme so removed from anything resembling reality that even its author openly admits it\u2019s untrue:\n\nSadly, the Obama administration failed to swap the useless 1 for a more functional 8 to complete the heartfelt message, perhaps in consolation to former White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel\u2019s tragically shortened middle finger.\n\nSo, in fact, the number corresponds to: 1-800-F1U-CKYO. Dialing 1-800-FUCKYO would not, as the item\u2019s second sentence claims, connect the dialer to a Healthcare.gov operator. It wouldn\u2019t connect to anything, because FUCKYO isn\u2019t even seven characters long. (Dialing 1-800-FUCK-YOU, which is reportedly a sex line, currently gets you a busy signal, thanks to the Daily Caller and Drudge.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGiven that each phone button offers a choice of three or four letters, the real number could also be used to spell out 1-D1VA-KY-6.\n\nThe sequence wasn\u2019t even chosen by the current administration: According to Nexis, 1-800-318-2596 was originally used for a Medicare hotline in 1999.\n\nSponsored\n\nAnyway:\n\nIf you have any questions about the Affordable Care Act, call 1-800-318-2596.\n\nIf you have questions about The Daily Caller\u2019s editorial decision-making, call 1-C0CK-0N-B0AR.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "too insidery, media, drudge report, daily caller, hot air, memes, Gawker", "author": "J.K.
