Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton finally appeared on The View today, and what she said has some people buzzing.

Clinton didn't mince words when she was asked to clarify her claim that unborn children have no rights whatsoever. She did, however, say that she thinks it's possible to be a pro-life feminist.

Reactions were quite varied:

Moving on... Feminism means all humans are equal. Could a man be a pro-life feminist who wants gov't to dictate a woman's body? Hells no. — Michael Salamone (@MichaelSalamone) April 5, 2016
