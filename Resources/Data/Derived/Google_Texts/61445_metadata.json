You might even see them on the campaign trail soon. And they\u2019ll take President Putin \u2018anytime.\u2019\n\nFunny or Die, Will Ferrell and Adam McKay\u2019s comedy website, has garnered plenty of attention over the years for its commitment to political content. The site posted a \u201csex tape\u201d starring Alyssa Milano that was actually all about the bloodshed in Syria.\n\nThey did a bunch of pro-Obamacare videos, including the famous \u201cBetween Two Ferns\u201d sketch with President Obama. (The \u201cinterview\u201d segment included a link to Healthcare.gov, which made Funny or Die the biggest driver of referrals to the Affordable Care Act site the morning the video dropped.) They even worked to get an amateur comedian\u2014who was jailed for supposedly endangering the United Arab Emirates\u2019 national security with a YouTube video\u2014 out of a maximum-security prison in Abu Dhabi:\n\nAnd this week, Funny or Die entered the news business\u2014sort of. \u201cIt\u2019s time for an even less respectable news outlet. Welcome to Funny Or Die News!\u201d they tweeted on Wednesday. The new content vertical will feature posts covering (and adding humorous commentary to) the day\u2019s top stories, ranging from politics and pop culture to sports and technology. The four-person, New York City-based news team is overseen by editor-in-chief Dan Abramson, who used to run the comedy section of The Huffington Post.\n\n\u201cBasically, it kind of felt like a natural extension of what we were doing already,\u201d Abramson told The Daily Beast. \u201cWe wanted to create a dedicated hub where people can dive into it and get all this commentary on the news.\u201d\n\nThe team has published items such as this satirical interactive map of state ballot initiatives, and a piece on Thomas Eric Duncan, the first Ebola patient diagnosed in the United States who died on Wednesday. Funny or Die News also features Vox-style \u201cexplainers,\u201d including \u201cThe Middle East\u2014Why Shit So Fucked Up?\u201d and \u201cWars You've Never Heard Of.\u201d\n\nFunny or Die News promises to post on subjects like the Obama presidency, Ferguson, and ISIS horrors, and has pledged to avoid \u201cclick-baity, salacious topics that would come across as SEO-centric,\u201d like celebrity nude pics and \u201cAmtrak ticket prices group rate.\u201d And though the team is taking on news from a decidedly comic perspective, they are well aware that they might have to take a cautious approach when tackling ISIS or Ebola.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s gonna be hard,\u201d Abramson said. \u201cThere are a lot of sensitive topics in the news\u2026and we will have to figure out what the right comedic angle is, and be smart about the jokes.\u201d\n\nAs for what\u2019s next, Abramson says he might add more news writers to his staff, and plans to work closely with the video crew that also works on Funny or Die\u2019s other political content. Also, he\u2019s considering sending his writers out into the field and on the road to do some original reporting.\n\n\u201cI love the idea of sending a Funny or Die reporter out to cover an event,\u201d he said. \u201cTo have a [politician] take a question, and have them say, \u2018I\u2019m with Funny or Die News\u2019\u2026That would be a lot of fun, to send them on the campaign trail, get \u2019em press passes.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "swin24"}, "keywords": "entertainment, Will Ferrell", "publicationDate": 201410100945, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/entertainment", "description": "Will Ferrell and Adam McKay\u2019s comedy website is entering the news business.
