Pelosi assures us that through ObamaCare, we are now free to not work and have all of our needs provided for. In one frenzied day of unconstitutional law-making in 2010, not working became the new morality because we are all supposedly being held captive to our jobs because of health insurance.\n\nNow Nancy Pelosi is showing us that the hippie movement has reached its crowning achievement, being institutionalized in the legislation known as ObamaCare.\n\nWe saw the high point of the anti-war movement of the 1960s being institutionalized when John Kerry became Secretary of State in 2013. Falling short of becoming the second anti-war President, Kerry took the next best thing, becoming Secretary of State. There couldn\u2019t be a better choice if we wanted someone who could be the American spokesman for appeasing our enemies, opposing our greatest ally Israel and declaring the end of American influence around the world.\n\nNancy Pelosi and Harry Reid don\u2019t have an original thought. One wonders if all of their staff members are Marxists and former hippies, feeding them their daily propaganda points. The latest transformational concept we\u2019re supposed to pick up and run with is that work is bad and ObamaCare frees us from it.\n\nIn response to a report released February 4 by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), which estimated 2.5 million people leaving the workforce by 2024 due to ObamaCare, Pelosi explained they would be dropping out because \u201cthey are following their aspirations to be a writer; to be self-employed; to start a business. This is the entrepreneurial piece. So it\u2019s not going to cost jobs. It\u2019s going to shift how people make a living and reach their aspirations.\u201d\n\nAnd of course absolutely anyone who \u201caspires\u201d to be unemployed could just drop out of the workforce as well and still be insured. While there are already laws and regulations in place which help you keep your insurance when you change jobs, ObamaCare now makes it possible that hippies and other able-bodied people who \u201cdrop out\u201d to pursue whatever their heart desires, will still have health insurance.\n\nFinally, after 50 years, the hippie lifestyle has been institutionalized!\n\nIt would seem that Pelosi thinks ObamaCare has brought us to the end of what the Marxists call class struggle and we are now in the ultimate state of communism as envisioned by Karl Marx in this 1845 description:\n\n\u201c...in communist society, where nobody has one exclusive sphere of activity but each can become accomplished in any branch he wishes, society regulates the general production and thus makes it possible for me to do one thing today and another tomorrow, to hunt in the morning, fish in the afternoon, rear cattle in the evening, criticise after dinner, just as I have a mind, without ever becoming hunter, fisherman, herdsman or critic.\u201d\n\nOf course, while Marx said it would take a totalitarian \u201cdictatorship of the proletariat\u201d to lead us into this utopia, Pelosi tells us that government-run health insurance has done the same thing.\n\nAfter the un-Affordable Care Act was passed in 2010 (so, as Pelosi had said, we could find out what was in it), she explained it this way:\n\n\u201cWe see it as an entrepreneurial bill, a bill that says to someone, if you want to be creative and be a musician or whatever, you can leave your work, focus on your talent, your skill, your passion, your aspirations because you will have health care.\u201d\n\nThere it is. You\u2019re now free to become an artist, an author, a fisherman, or, dare we say, a hippie, and somehow all your needs will be met - all because you have signed up for ObamaCare.", "article_metadata": {"rating": "general", "description": "Institutionalizing the hippie lifestyle, Hippie movement has reach its crowning achievement, being institutionalized in the legislation known as ObamaCare, Nancy Pelosi, Harry Reid", "og": {"description": "Institutionalizing the hippie lifestyle, Hippie movement has reach its crowning achievement, being institutionalized in the legislation known as ObamaCare, Nancy Pelosi, Harry Reid", "title": "Institutionalizing the hippie lifestyle"}, "robots": "index, follow", "revisit-after": "7 days", "keywords": "Institutionalizing the hippie lifestyle, Hippie movement has reach its crowning achievement, being institutionalized in the legislation known as ObamaCare, Nancy Pelosi, Harry Reid", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2b45\"", "article_summary": "Finally, after 50 years, the hippie lifestyle has been institutionalized!\nNow Nancy Pelosi is showing us that the hippie movement has reached its crowning achievement, being institutionalized in the legislation known as ObamaCare.\nPelosi assures us that through ObamaCare, we are now free to not work and have all of our needs provided for.\nIn one frenzied day of unconstitutional law-making in 2010, not working became the new morality because we are all supposedly being held captive to our jobs because of health insurance.\nYou\u2019re now free to become an artist, an author, a fisherman, or, dare we say, a hippie, and somehow all your needs will be met - all because you have signed up for ObamaCare."}
