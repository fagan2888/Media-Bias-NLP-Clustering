Greg Lindstrom | Flathead Beacon\n\nIn an effort to address the growing demand for nurses, Kalispell Regional Healthcare has developed a new residency program that is one of the first in Montana.\n\nThe program, formally established in the last year, welcomes newly licensed nurses for a 12-month residency that seeks to bridge the gap from academic nursing to clinical practice.\n\nThe demand for nurses has spiked over the last decade due to rising patient numbers as the Baby Boomer generation ages and more people gain insurance through the federal Affordable Care Act. The number of nurses in Montana has increased by more than 1,500, from 18,263 to 19,897 in August, according to the Montana Board of Nursing.\n\nBut, according to national research, roughly 25 percent of new nurses leave a position in the first year, a significant contributing factor to the shortage.\n\n\u201cIt can be hard to find experienced nurses, which is why we\u2019re trying to grow this residency program,\u201d said Jim Oliverson, vice president at Kalispell Regional Healthcare.\n\nMandy Pokorny, coordinator of the nurse residency program at Kalispell Regional Healthcare, said it is important for nurses fresh out of college to have support and structure to help them succeed and transition into a new career.\n\n\u201cThere can be a gap from school to work and it is a very demanding practice,\u201d Pokorny said.\n\n\u201cSupport early on is really important.\u201d\n\nNurses accepted into the residency program are paid and sign a three-year commitment to Kalispell Regional Healthcare. So far the program has attracted nurses from across the country, including California and Washington. Once enrolled, nurses undergo weekly courses, mentoring opportunities and hands-on experience throughout the vast parts of the hospital, including the surgical floor, intermediate care floor and transitional care unit. In the first 14 weeks, nurse residents work closely with a trained preceptor, learning to become more independent in their role over time, Pokorny said.\n\n\u201cOur main goal is to provide tem a strong foundation,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Montana Department of Labor published a study in 2013 that projected the state\u2019s health care industry to grow by roughly 1,300 jobs every year until 2022. There are expected to be roughly 349 openings for nurses annually during that span.\n\n\u201cThe \u2018trial by fire\u2019 approach doesn\u2019t work,\u201d Oliverson said. \u201cIt puts patient safety at risk and puts nurses at risk. That\u2019s why this residency program is so important.\u201d\n\nFor more information about the nurse residency program, visit krh.org.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Flathead Beacon", "description": "In an effort to address the growing demand for nurses, Kalispell Regional Healthcare has developed a new residency program that is one of the first in Montana.
