EVERETT, Wash. (AP) - Boeing celebrated the groundbreaking Tuesday for its 777X Composite Wing Center at Everett.

The new $1 billion, 1 million square foot center is close to the widebody plant where the 777X will be assembled because the wings are the largest Boeing has ever built - 114 feet long and 23 feet wide.

The 777X is expected to be more fuel efficient than the standard Triple Seven and carry as many as 400 passengers on flights as far as 9,500 miles.

Boeing says it has 300 orders and commitments for two 777X models, which compete with the Airbus A350.

The new wing center is expected to be completed in May 2016. The first delivery of the 777X is targeted for 2020.
