Huffines.\n\nTexas Rep. Jason Villalba is accusing a state senator \u2014 a fellow Dallas Republican \u2014 of injecting race into Villalba\u2019s re-election campaign.\n\nVillalba slammed Sen. Don Huffines on Friday for paying for a series of mailers that were sent out last week on behalf Villalba\u2019s opponent, lawyer Dan Morenoff.\n\n\u201cI find it deeply troubling the third party that put this out is funded almost entirely by Sen. Huffines,\u201d he said. \u201cHere\u2019s a Texas senator, who has no stake at all in this race, and yet he\u2019s poured $150,000 dollars of his own money.\u201d\n\nVillalba also complained that Huffines, a freshman senator in the middle of his term, wrote a letter to voters \u201cinsinuating lies about me and about my record in the House \u2026 and he recently endorsed [Morenoff] publicly with some very pejorative language about one of his own representatives in his own district \u2013 me.\u201d\n\nVillalba said that one \u201cdistasteful and disgusting\u201d piece of mail depicts him next to a hooded man and suggests Villalba is giving handouts to convicted felons. The text reads: \u201cRepresentative Jason Villalba voted to expand welfare benefits to convicted drug felons,\u201d and \u201cwhile honest, hard-working Texans struggle, Villalba wants to give handouts to felons.\u201d\n\nVillalba said he wasn\u2019t sure what Huffines, whose district engulfs House District 114, motives were for sending out the mailers.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know the answer to that. Is it because he also has a problem with me being Hispanic in this region? If not, then he shouldn\u2019t put that information out there,\u201d Villalba said. \u201cHe is equally culpable in these kinds of attacks in our district and it\u2019s distasteful, disgusting and I\u2019m so disappointed in the direction this race has taken.\u201d\n\nWhen asked whether Huffines knew what was in the mailer when he paid for it or why he was getting involved in the race a spokesman for the senator did not directly answer the questions, but said Villalba \u201ccontinues to lie and deceive voters.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe clearly wants to hide that he supports welfare for felons and that he supports expanding Medicaid under Obamacare,\u201d Huffines\u2019 spokesman Matt Langston said in a written statement. \u201cI\u2019m not surprised that Jason would rather whine than try to defend his liberal voting record.\u201d\n\nHuffines has contributed more than $54,000 worth of mailers and other voter outreach efforts on behalf of Morenoff, the Dallas lawyer looking to unseat Villalba in Tuesday\u2019s primary, according to recent campaign filings.\n\nAccording to the filings, a majority of Huffines\u2019 contributions were to the North Texas Conservative Coalition, a political action committee registered in Tyler that supports Morenoff. Huffines\u2019 contributions have made up all but $5,500 of that group\u2019s funding for the last year.\n\nAccording to finance reports, this month Huffines paid several installments of $9,136 for mailers to House District 114 voters.\n\nThe treasurer for the North Texas Conservative Coalition, which paid for the mailers, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nMorenoff also did not return calls seeking comment, but he told KXAS-TV (NBC5) this week that he only learned about the mailer when he saw it in his mailbox. He doesn\u2019t take issue with it.\n\n\u201cWhen I look at it I just see a guy in clothes in the shade. I didn\u2019t actually see another face,\u201d Morenoff said. \u201cMe and Jason are both Hispanics\u2026. I don\u2019t see anything that\u2019s racist about it. It\u2019s really just focusing on the policy issue.\u201d\n\nVillalba said he isn\u2019t bothered by the attacks on his record, saying the idea that he voted to provide benefits for felons is \u201cinaccurate.\u201d The bill, which passed with bipartisan support, dealt with food assistance for first-time drug offenders.\n\n\u201cPolitics is a rough and tumble business,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can expect that in any major race we are going to have situations where people say things about you and that\u2019s to be expected \u2026 and I\u2019m comfortable with those kinds of issue-based attacks.\u201d\n\nBut, he said, he took issue with the images in the mailers, which he said had \u201cracial overtones.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen the attacks became about making the other candidate look foolish \u2026 in this instance putting my face looking contorted as I was speaking next to the face of an African-American male in a hoodie looking very ominous, those are the things you don\u2019t expect,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the issue of using race and injecting fear into this climate in order to scare someone away from a certain race,\u201d he said.\n\nHuffines publicly endorsed Morenoff this year. He and his wife have also contributed more than $15,000 directly to Morenoff\u2019s campaign and for voter outreach.\n\nThis week, voters also received a nearly two-page letter from Huffines likening Villalba to Hillary Clinton, saying he \u201cvocally supported expanding Medicaid in Texas to support Obamacare,\u201d and calling him a \u201cbig government liberal who has aligned himself with Democrats and betrayed the voters of the 114th District.\u201d\n\nVillalba and Morenoff, two Dallas lawyers who said they have known each other for years, have clashed at recent forums over a variety of hot-topic issues, like vaccinations, interpretations of the Constitution and school funding.\n\nThe race is part of a the new normal for North Texan Republican incumbents: challenges from hard-right candidates for House seats. Villalba has been a staunch ally of House GOP leaders who are facing a small but persistent group of challengers over immigration, spending and other matters.\n\nHuffines and Villalba are also on differing sides of the GOP presidential contest. Villalba has backed Sen. Marco Rubio. Huffines is behind Sen. Ted Cruz.\n\nVillalba called Morenoff\u2019s denials about the mailers \u201cdisingenuous\u201d and asked that he disavow the tactic.\n\n\u201cWhen he stands by that flyer, he is essentially endorsing that flyer, endorsing the content and he becomes the issuer of that flyer, regardless who paid for it or not,\u201d he said.\n\nMorenoff told NBC5 he was \u201cperfectly happy being judged by the campaign that I\u2019ve run.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been very respectful about the differences between me and my opponent,\u201d he said.\n\nThe winner of Tuesday\u2019s primary will face Democrat Jim Burke in November.\n\nTwitter: @juliefancher", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RyYWlsYmxhemVyc2Jsb2cuZGFsbGFzbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxNi8wMi9yZXAtamFzb24tdmlsbGFsYmEtc2xhbXMtc2VuLWRvbi1odWZmaW5lcy1vcHBvbmVudC1kYW4tbW9yZW5vZmYtZm9yLW1haWxlcnMuaHRtbC8=", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Julie Fancher", "og": {"site_name": "Trail Blazers Blog", "description": "Updated at 3:21 p.m.: Revised to include statement from Sen.
