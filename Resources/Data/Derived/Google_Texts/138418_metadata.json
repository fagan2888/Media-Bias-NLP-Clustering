Jamelle Bouie looks ahead at the next budget battle.\n\nPolitical combat is a zero-sum game, so it\u2019s tempting to say that\u2014if Republicans lost\u2014Democrats must have won. But that\u2019s not as right as it sounds.\n\nAs President Obama noted in his address this morning, the public is frustrated with everyone in \u201cthis town.\u201d Americans don\u2019t blame Obama and congressional Democrats for the shutdown, but they hold them responsible for some of the dysfunction in Washington. It\u2019s why, in the most recent Washington Post poll, only 42 percent of Americans approved of President Obama\u2019s conduct, and only 33 percent said the same of congressional Democrats. And the same NBC News poll with abysmal ratings for the Republican Party also had congressional Democrats with a 36 percent approval rating. The Democratic Party escaped the blast of the GOP\u2019s self-destruction, but it wasn\u2019t unharmed.\n\nThe only victor in this melee\u2014if scuffed, dirty, and covered in broken glass\u2014was the United States and its political institutions. After all, this wasn\u2019t a fight over policy as much as it was a battle for the norms of American governance. Can a minority of the minority direct the conduct of the entire government? Can it threaten economic disaster to win concessions?\n\n\n\nThe answer, for now, is no. Or, as President Obama said in his address this morning, if \u201cYou don\u2019t like a particular policy or president, then go out there and win an election.\u201d Legislative hostage taking has no place in our system.\n\nWith that said, it\u2019s also true that we\u2019re just three months from another budget deadline. Still, the painful experience of the last three weeks should be enough to keep right-wing Republicans from creating another manufactured crisis. Remember, before the stand-off, the National Review\u2019s Jonathan Strong asked House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan if he thought President Obama was serious about his vow not to negotiate. Ryan scoffed, \u201cOh, nobody believes that. Nobody believes that\u2026I think most people believe he\u2019s just posturing for now.\u201d\n\nNow that this fiasco has ended with complete surrender to Obama and congressional Democrats, Ryan and his allies should feel chastened, and aware of one thing: When the stakes are high enough, Obama will not bend.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that some conservatives are trying to claim this outcome as a victory. \u201cWe saw first of all, millions of millions of American people rising up across this country, over two million people signing a national petition to defund Obamacare,\u201d said Texas Sen. Ted Cruz in a press conference following last night\u2019s vote, describing his new email list as a victory for conservatives. Likewise, Slate\u2019s Dave Weigel scored this incredible quote from South Carolina Rep. Mick Mulvaney, who thinks this was a success for the conservative movement: \u201cWe believe we did it for the right reasons. We believe it was good policy. We believe good policy makes good politics.\u201d\n\nBut there\u2019s no reason to take this rationalization seriously. Republicans chose...poorly, and now they\u2019re trying to minimize the sting of defeat. Even Erick Erickson\u2014the right-wing activist who has dedicated his life to rooting out conservative apostasy, whether or not it exists\u2014has turned his focus to elections, and not the next confrontation. \u201cGrassroots upset about this fight should be encouraged,\u201d he writes, \u201cWe\u2019d have never gotten this far with the GOP before 2010. Imagine now the possibilities in 2014 if we make examples of a GOP that refused to fight Obamacare.\u201d\n\nWhat can we expect for the next few months? In his address, Obama issued a to-do list for Congress: A \u201cbalanced approach to a responsible budget,\u201d comprehensive immigration reform, and a farm bill that preserves funding for food stamps. But the odds that any of this will happen are low. As long as John Boehner insists on holding a majority of the majority for all policy, the ideological gulf between the two chambers is too large to find common ground. Just look at last night\u2019s debt ceiling vote: 144 House Republicans voted to continue the shutdown and default on the nation\u2019s debt. For these right-wing Leninists, there is no compromise, only total victory. And, absent a sea change in the behavior of the Republican base, they\u2019ll retain a huge amount of influence in GOP caucus.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "@jbouie"}, "keywords": "Republican Party, u.s. poli, Barack Obama, John Boehner", "publicationDate": 201310171935, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/voxbox/jamelle-bouie", "description": "Jamelle Bouie looks ahead at the next budget battle.", "pageNum": 1, "title": "The Wacko Birds Will Fly Again", "tags": "entity:organization/republican_party,topic:politics,entity:person/barack_obama,entity:person/john_boehner", "environment": "dev", "platform": "desktop", "template": "article", "type": "house", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"The Wacko Birds Will Fly Again\",\"link\":\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/10/17/the-wacko-birds-will-fly-again.html\",\"image_url\":\"http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2013/10/17/the-wacko-birds-will-fly-again/jcr:content/image.crop.410.273.jpg/46105865.cached.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"/content/dailybeast/articles/2013/10/17/the-wacko-birds-will-fly-again\",\"pub_date\":\"2013-10-17T19:35:00+00:00\",\"section\":\"U.S. Politics\",\"author\":\"Jamelle Bouie\",\"tags\":[\"republican_party\",\"politics\",\"barack_obama\",\"john_boehner\"]}", "news_keywords": "Republican Party, US Politics, Barack Obama, John Boehner", "sectionTaxanomies": "politics", "fb": {"admins": "1703087,30000737,1117577220,1276800108,931159,514915512", "app_id": 189930913679}, "authors": "Jamelle Bouie", "article": {"section": "politics", "published_time": "2013-10-17T19:35:00.000Z", "author": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/contributors/jamelle-bouiehtml"}, "resourceType": "dailybeast2/components/pages/article", "contentpath": "/content/dailybeast/articles/2013/10/17/the-wacko-birds-will-fly-again", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "Jamelle Bouie looks ahead at the next budget battle.", "title": "The Wacko Birds Will Fly Again", "url": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/10/17/the-wacko-birds-will-fly-again.html", "image": "http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2013/10/17/the-wacko-birds-will-fly-again/jcr:content/image.img.2000.jpg/1383175950469.cached.jpg", "type": "article"}, "authorIds": "/etc/authors/j/jamelle-bouie", "content-type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8"}, "article_summary": "And the same NBC News poll with abysmal ratings for the Republican Party also had congressional Democrats with a 36 percent approval rating.\nIt\u2019s why, in the most recent Washington Post poll, only 42 percent of Americans approved of President Obama\u2019s conduct, and only 33 percent said the same of congressional Democrats.\nRemember, before the stand-off, the National Review\u2019s Jonathan Strong asked House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan if he thought President Obama was serious about his vow not to negotiate.\nJust look at last night\u2019s debt ceiling vote: 144 House Republicans voted to continue the shutdown and default on the nation\u2019s debt.\nFalloutHouse Republicans may have taken a beaten in the shutdown deal, but they shouldn\u2019t be counted out."}
