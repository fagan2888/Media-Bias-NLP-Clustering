They really care about people.\u201d\n\nBurns was one of about 250 people who came to the two-day clinic, staffed by about 575 volunteer dentists, hygienists, nurses and others and sponsored by the Connecticut Foundation for Dental Outreach, a Southington-based nonprofit group.\n\nDr. Robert Schreibman, a retired pediatric dentist from Glastonbury, said he started the group nine years ago to provide dental care to people \u201cslipping between the cracks\u201d because of a variety of reason.\n\nMany people who come to the clinic, he said, have medical insurance but not dental coverage, or have high-deductible plans they can\u2019t afford.\n\n\u201cA lot of the target population is the working poor,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have jobs, but can\u2019t afford the co-pays, and they\u2019re getting higher and higher.\u201d\n\nAbout 97 percent of the patients, he said, are adults. Children have more access to low or no-cost dental care through the state\u2019s HUSKY insurance, school-based health clinics and other programs, he said.\n\nSince the group started, he said, they have provided about $10 million worth of free care to about 15,000 patients around the state.\n\nUntil this year, the group ran one clinic per year, but this year expanded to offer two clinics \u2014 one in Danbury in March and this one in East Lyme, the first time Mission of Mercy has operated in southeastern Connecticut.\n\nDr. Gregory Toback, a New London periodontist, organized local dentists to bring the clinic to New London County.\n\n\u201cThere was a lot of enthusiasm by the local dental community to host this event,\u201d he said.\n\nAmong patients he had treated thus far that day was a young man from New London with a painful infected tooth that Toback extracted.\n\nAnother patient had a decayed and unsightly front tooth that also needed to be removed.\n\nSeveral dentists have offered to provide replacement teeth after extractions at the clinic in follow-up appointments at their offices.\n\nSchreibman said that for some patients, getting longstanding dental care needs taken care of can be \u201clife changing.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome of them can get jobs after this, because before they were afraid to smile,\u201d he said.\n\nSchreibman said the biggest need among patients who came to the clinic was for cleanings and to have cavities removed and filled. In addition, Toback said, many also need old fillings or other previously done dental work replaced.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of patients with aging dentistry,\u201d he said.\n\nOne of them was Marion Davis of Bristol, whose son brought her to the clinic for her first cleaning in about four years and replacement of an old filling.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t afford the dentist,\u201d she said, as she waited her turn in one of the 10 chairs set up for those who need replacement fillings. \u201cThey\u2019re charging too much.\u201d\n\nThe clinic was set up in space provided for free in the high school\u2019s commons area that normally serves as the cafeteria.\n\nUpon entering, patients were channeled through an orderly setup of screenings, triage, waiting and treatment areas, equipped with a wide variety of mobile dental equipment including exam chairs and lights, pharmacy station, electric suction devices and digital X-ray machines.\n\nThe equipment was purchased with grants and donations, Schreibman said.\n\nThe clinic opened at 6 a.m. that morning and would remain open until the last patient was care for, he said, then reopen at 6 a.m. on Sunday.\n\nNo appointment is needed.\n\n\u201cPeople can just show up,\u201d he said. \u201cWe hope to see even more patients.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s exactly what Jason Bailey did Saturday morning.\n\nThe 30-year-old West Hartford resident, who emigrated from Jamaica two years ago, said he came at the urging of his wife, who was also receiving care at the clinic.\n\nIt was the first time he\u2019d ever been to the dentist.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good environment,\u201d he said, reclining in an exam chair as Dr. David Goldschneider of East Lyme prepared to remove a cavity. \u201cEverybody\u2019s nice.\u201d\n\nNew London residents Chris and Clara Pezzello had their first cleaning in about three years at the clinic.\n\n\u201cThe last time we had cleanings was when we had dental insurance,\u201d Chris Pezzello said.\n\nBoth work part-time jobs and have medical insurance that doesn\u2019t include dental coverage. They had arrived at about 8:30 that morning, and by noon were waiting their turn for fillings.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very efficient, and everyone\u2019s very friendly,\u201d he said.\n\nj.benson@theday.com\n\nTwitter: @BensonJudy", "article_metadata": {"description": "East Lyme\u00a0\u2014 Despite some lingering numbness and a mouthful of gauze, Michael Burns\u00a0spoke enthusiastically about\u00a0how he\u2019d", "og": {"site_name": "The Day", "description": "East Lyme\u00a0\u2014 Despite some lingering numbness and a mouthful of gauze, Michael Burns\u00a0spoke enthusiastically about\u00a0how he\u2019d", "title": "Free dental clinic provides care to many who've gone without", "url": "http://www.theday.com/article/20151010/NWS01/151019909", "image": "http://www.theday.com/storyimage/NL/20151010/NWS01/151019909/AR/0/AR-151019909.jpg&imageversion=16by9&Maxw=960", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "East Lyme\u00a0\u2014 Despite some lingering numbness and a mouthful of gauze, Michael Burns\u00a0spoke enthusiastically about\u00a0how he\u2019d", "title": "Free dental clinic provides care to many who've gone without", "url": "http://www.theday.com/article/20151010/NWS01/151019909", "image": "http://www.theday.comhttp://www.theday.com/storyimage/NL/20151010/NWS01/151019909/AR/0/AR-151019909.jpg&imageversion=16by9&Maxw=960", "site": "@thedayct", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "Free dental clinic provides care to many who've gone without, Local News, East Lyme CT,New London CT,Health,The Day,AP:Dentistry", "article": {"published_time": 20151010200508, "modified_time": 201510112112}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Free dental clinic provides care to many who've gone without, Local News, East Lyme CT,New London CT,Health,The Day,AP:Dentistry"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI had a cleaning and a tooth extraction and an infection taken care of.\u201dBurns, a town resident and self-employed home improvement contractor, said the free clinic was the first time he\u2019d had dental care in about two years.\nSince the group started, he said, they have provided about $10 million worth of free care to about 15,000 patients around the state.\nChildren have more access to low or no-cost dental care through the state\u2019s HUSKY insurance, school-based health clinics and other programs, he said.\n\u201cI just got about $1,000 worth of dental work,\u201d he said, just before checking out of the Mission of Mercy free dental clinic at East Lyme High School that had been open since 6 a.m. and will continue Sunday.\nEast Lyme \u2014 Despite some lingering numbness and a mouthful of gauze, Michael Burns spoke enthusiastically about how he\u2019d spent his morning Saturday."}
