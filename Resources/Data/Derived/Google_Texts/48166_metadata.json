(AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta) Associated Press\n\nSome Democratic lawmakers intensified pressure on President Barack Obama Tuesday to take actions he has been resisting when it comes to health care and the nation\u2019s energy supply.\n\nMr. Obama hosted a private meeting at the White House for House Democrats. Both sides afterward described the session as productive and friendly. But Rep. Carol Shea-Porter (D., N.H.) told Mr. Obama at one point that some people should have left their jobs over the flawed rollout of the health-care law that is the centerpiece of his domestic legacy.\n\n\u201cSome people should tender their resignations,\u201d Ms. Shea-Porter told the president, officials in the meeting said. An aide to the congresswoman confirmed the comment.\n\nMr. Obama has resisted firing people over the troubled launch of the health-care website last fall. In an interview with Fox News\u2019s Bill O\u2019Reilly on Sunday, Mr. Obama was asked why he hadn\u2019t fired Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius.\n\n\u201cMy main priority right now is making sure that it delivers for the American people,\u201d he said of the health-care law.\n\nAt a news conference on Capitol Hill earlier on Tuesday, a bipartisan group of lawmakers called for the Obama administration to quickly approve the Keystone XL pipeline project, whose permit application was first submitted six years ago.\n\nSen. Mary Landrieu (D., La), one of the party\u2019s most vulnerable incumbents facing re-election in 2014, said: \u201cThis pipeline is essential. The time for study is over. Action to build it is now.\u201d\n\nSecretary of State John Kerry has just begun the final stage of the Keystone review, aimed at determining if the pipeline coming down from Canadian oil sands is in the national interest. Eight agencies have up to 90 days to weigh in. The Obama administration has given no timeline on a when a final verdict may come.\n\nParticipants at the White House meeting said the mood was relaxed. Food was served and Mr. Obama and his cabinet and senior staff mingled with Democrats afterward \u2013 a level of conviviality that hasn\u2019t always been the norm at such meetings.\n\nMs. Shea-Porter is also in a difficult re-election campaign. She represents a state where thousands of people received notifications that they would lose their insurance plans after the Affordable Care Act kicked in.\n\nAfter the meeting, her aide said the congresswoman \u201cappreciates the efforts to fix the law. \u2026 But there\u2019s work to be done and someone should be held accountable for the unacceptable rollout.\u201d\n\nOne Democratic official at the meeting described Mr. Obama as \u201cspirited.\u201d\n\nIn a statement afterward, the White House said: \u201cIn this year\u2019s State of the Union address, the president declared 2014 a year of action. While he will continue to take action through executive authority, he stressed the importance of working with Congress on their shared priorities to help the middle class. The president discussed the importance of increasing the minimum wage, strengthening education, passing commonsense immigration reform, fighting to make sure women get equal pay for equal work, extending unemployment benefits, as well as other measures that will create jobs and help middle class families.\u201d\n\nSiobhan Hughes contributed to this article.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Some Democratic lawmakers intensified pressure on President Barack Obama to take actions he has been resisting on health care and the nation\u2019s energy supply.", "title": "Obama Faces Fresh Democratic Pressure on Health Care", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2014/02/04/obama-faces-fresh-democratic-pressure-on-health-care/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-BJ311_Obama_P_20140204210627.jpg"}, "site": "WSJPolitics", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Politics", "article.headline": "Obama Faces Fresh Democratic Pressure on Health Care", "description": "Some Democratic lawmakers intensified pressure on President Barack Obama to take actions he has been resisting on health care and the nation\u2019s energy supply.", "article_section": "Politics", "author": "WSJ Staff", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Washington Wire Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Washington Wire", "article.summary": "Some Democratic lawmakers intensified pressure on President Barack Obama to take actions he has been resisting on health care and the nation\u2019s energy supply.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-02-05T02:11:25-05:00", "dj.asn": "10-143", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2014/02/04/obama-faces-fresh-democratic-pressure-on-health-care/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-WB-43348", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Politics", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Some Democratic lawmakers intensified pressure on President Barack Obama to take actions he has been resisting on health care and the nation\u2019s energy supply.", "title": "Obama Faces Fresh Democratic Pressure on Health Care", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2014/02/04/obama-faces-fresh-democratic-pressure-on-health-care/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-BJ311_Obama_P_20140204210627.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Washington Wire", "article.id": "BL-WB-43348", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-02-05T02:12:27-05:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd2e8\"", "article_summary": "In an interview with Fox News\u2019s Bill O\u2019Reilly on Sunday, Mr. Obama was asked why he hadn\u2019t fired Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius.\nMr. Obama hosted a private meeting at the White House for House Democrats.\nMr. Obama has resisted firing people over the troubled launch of the health-care website last fall.\nParticipants at the White House meeting said the mood was relaxed.\n(AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta) Associated PressSome Democratic lawmakers intensified pressure on President Barack Obama Tuesday to take actions he has been resisting when it comes to health care and the nation\u2019s energy supply."}
