CAMPAIGN OVERNIGHT: Political tomfoolery Pastor endorses in race to replace him MORE\u2019s (D-Ariz.) safe district \u2014 not even if it ends up including Rep. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.).\n\n\n\n\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut the Arizona state House assistant minority leader told The Hill during a trip to Washington, D.C., on Monday that he\u2019d prefer the freshman Democrat to run for reelection to her own seat.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s the only one that can hold that district,\u201d said Gallego. \u201cShe\u2019s set a good moderate tone for that district. She really has the voting record to hold that district, and no other Democrat can. It\u2019s going to severely effect the Democratic Party nationally, as well as locally, if we lose that seat.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut Gallego added: \u201cIf she jumps into this race with me, we\u2019re going to have to have a very spirited race. I\u2019m certainly not going to back down.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Arizona Republic reported last week after Pastor announced his retirement that Sinema is keeping her options open and could switch from a much tougher race in Arizona\u2019s swing 9th District to the 7th, which is a safe Democratic seat.\n\n\n\nSuch a decision would, as Gallego noted, make it tougher for the party to hold onto Sinema's seat. President Obama only narrowly carried the district in the past two presidential contests.\n\n\n\nGallego said he ultimately believes he\u2019s both the best fit for the liberal Phoenix district and has the strongest ability to build the campaign he\u2019ll need to win in the August primary, which has already drawn interest from half a dozen Democrats. The former Marine received the endorsement of the pro-veterans' PAC VoteVets.org shortly after launching his bid, and he said they've made his race a top priority.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have lots of Latino veterans that live in the district and need a responsive government,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m one of the few [candidates] that speaks Spanish. And I grew up in a fairly low-income family, and unfortunately, the district has a lot of lower-income families, and I can relate to that.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe also said his experience working in local politics, including for an effort to recall controversial Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, has given him the skills and connections needed to \u201cput together the functional aspects of the campaign\u201d to \u201chit the ground running,\u201d noting that he\u2019s already scheduled his first fundraiser, for March 20.\n\n\n\nThe Chicago native said he was unimpressed by the four inches of snow blanketing Washington, D.C., during his visit, and though it grounded House Speaker John Boehner (R) back in Ohio and postponed House and Senate votes, it hadn\u2019t stalled a packed schedule for Gallego.\n\n\n\nHe had stops to the National Council of La Raza Gala, a reception for the American Israel Public Affairs Committee conference, a reception for the Committee for Hispanic Caucuses BOLD PAC, among others, planned during his two-day visit and has discussed his bid with members of the congressional delegation. He hinted he might get support from one of them in the coming weeks.\n\n\n\nWhile the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee typically does not weigh in on contested primaries where the seat is safe, Gallego said he had been in touch with DCCC Executive Director Kelly Ward, with whom he worked on former Rep. Harry Mitchell\u2019s (D-Ariz.) campaign.\n\n\n\nGallego said part of his pitch to voters would be based on bringing dignity back to the state.\n\n\n\n\u201cI look forward to winning this race and trying to move Arizona out of 'The Daily Show' laugh track every day,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Even if Rep.
