On the last day of his trip to Washington, D.C., Pope Francis arrived on Capitol Hill around 9:15 Thursday morning.

Francis first met with House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, before he entered the House chamber for a joint session of Congress.

This event marks the first time a pope has addressed Congress—a goal Boehner, a Catholic himself, has had long before his ascension to speaker.

Here are 28 tweets from members of Congress:
