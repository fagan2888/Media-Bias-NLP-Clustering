Meyer\n\nFeb. 11 \u2014 Dave & Buster's Inc. lost its attempt to have a federal court dismiss a proposed class action that alleges the company intentionally reduced its workforce's hours to prevent employees from being eligible for health benefits.\n\nThe case is the first Employee Retirement Income Security Act lawsuit that alleges an employer, in response to the employer mandate of the Affordable Care Act, intentionally interfered with workers' benefits by cutting their hours to make them part time.\n\nIn an order issued Feb. 9, Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York denied Dave & Buster's motion to dismiss. He said there was enough evidence early in the case to support workers' claims that the company acted with an \u201cunlawful purpose\u201d when it reduced the hours of hundreds of employees, thereby making them ineligible for health benefits.\n\nThe proposed class action was brought by Dave & Buster's employee Maria De Lourdes Parra Marin, who worked at the company's Times Square store as a full-time employee until 2013. Marin alleged that the company reduced her hours\u2014and the hours of hundreds of other employees\u2014to make them part-time workers ineligible for company-provided health-care benefits. Marin alleged that the decision to do so was driven by one factor: the ACA's employer mandate.\n\nThe mandate requires larger employers to provide employees with affordable health insurance that meet minimum-value standards or potentially face penalties.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that by reducing workers' hours to make them ineligible for health-care benefits, Dave & Buster's violated ERISA Section 510. That provision prohibits employers from interfering with employees' receipt of ERISA-governed benefits such as health insurance.\n\nIn its motion to dismiss, Dave & Buster's argued that to establish a Section 510 claim, an employee must show more than a lost opportunity to accrue benefits. Dave & Buster's argued that under ERISA, an employee has no entitlement to future benefits and that it couldn't violate Section 510 by making its workers ineligible for future benefits.\n\nThe court rejected this argument, saying Marin had alleged that Dave & Buster's actions affected both current benefits and the ability to attain future benefits. \u201cPlaintiff has sufficiently pled that the employer acted with an \u2018unlawful purpose' when taking an adverse action against her,\u201d the court said.\n\nMarin was represented by Abbey Spanier, Conover Law Offices and Frumkin & Hunter. Dave & Buster's was represented by Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Jo-el J.
