The Cuban Commission for Human Rights and National Recognition said in a report Monday that Cuba arrested about 100 more dissidents in December compared to November, the month before Mr. Obama\u2019s announcement.\n\nState Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said improving human rights in Cuba is \u201ca critical focus\u201d of the administration\u2019s proposal.\n\n\u201cWe know that the situation in Cuba remains poor,\u201d she said.\n\nMexico has maintained diplomatic and economic ties with Cuba, while the U.S. imposed an embargo after Fidel Castro seized power in the early 1960s. Mr. Castro\u2019s brother, Raul, is now president.\n\nMr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto has traveled to Havana to meet with the Castros, and the Mexican government has waived most of Cuba\u2019s trade debt.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In a White House meeting Tuesday, President Obama will try to recruit Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto to pressure the Castro regime in Cuba for democratic reforms.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "In a White House meeting Tuesday, President Obama will try to recruit Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto to pressure the Castro regime in Cuba for democratic reforms.", "title": "Obama seeks Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s help to reform Cuba", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jan/6/obama-mexico-enrique-pena-nieto-cuba/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/06/3334d98df8446d006a0f6a7067000519.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/06/3334d98df8446d006a0f6a7067000519.jpg", "description": "In a White House meeting Tuesday, President Obama will try to recruit Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto to pressure the Castro regime in Cuba for democratic reforms.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Obama seeks Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s help to refor"}, "Author": "Dave Boyer", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Cuba, Mexico, Enrique Pe, Havana"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce23f\"", "article_summary": "In a White House meeting Tuesday, President Obama will try to recruit Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto to pressure the Castro regime in Cuba for democratic reforms.\nState Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said improving human rights in Cuba is \u201ca critical focus\u201d of the administration\u2019s proposal.\nThe talks between the two leaders come less than a month since Mr. Obama announced plans to normalize diplomatic relations with Havana, reversing more than 50 years of U.S. policy.\nMr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto has traveled to Havana to meet with the Castros, and the Mexican government has waived most of Cuba\u2019s trade debt.\nThe administration official said the White House also is seeking support from other Latin American leaders to lobby Cuba to improve human rights and allow greater freedom for its citizens."}
