The meeting will be 9 a.m. at the Rood Center, 950 Maidu Ave., Nevada City.\n\nOn Tuesday, Haffey and Martin Polt, chief financial officer, presented highlights of the proposed budget, which has been in the works for the last five months.\n\nThe proposed plan calls for 778 county employees, down from the 783 in 2014-15. Most of the employees who left had been hired on a temporary basis to support the county\u2019s implementation of the Affordable Care Act, Polt said. The total number of employees is down 26 percent from 2001-02.\n\nAnother decrease in expenses was realized by a $2.9 million drop in contribution to the California Medical Services Program, a health-care program for indigent adults.\n\nThe decrease was triggered by the county\u2019s implementation of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nProperty tax revenues are expected to increase 5.5 percent \u2014 a positive sign that will help the county continue its recovery, Haffey said.\n\nPolt said real estate transfer taxes, an indicator of future property tax revenues, showed a likely continuing increase over the next year or so at least.\n\nSales tax revenues are also up 2 percent \u2014 projected at $3.37 million for 2015-16 \u2014 but still have not caught up to the high point of $3.65 million almost a decade ago.\n\nOn the \u201cchallenges\u201d side, the county will see five years of increasing expenses for the California Public Employees Retirement System.\n\nTo mitigate the expected hit, Polt said the county has transferred an additional $500,000 into its pension reserve fund \u2014 now up over $3 million.\n\nThe general fund balance, projected at $23.42 million by June 30 of this year, is projected to stay almost flat at $23.539 million by June 30, 2016.\n\nThe county has set up three \u201ctiers\u201d of employee retirement benefits, with the lowest level of benefits going to the third tier, or the most recently hired (in 2013).\n\nThe county was able to balance the 2015-16 budget \u201cwithout dipping into the reserves, although that may be necessary in the future,\u201d Polt said. \u201cWe continue to be vigilant to mitigate pension costs.\u201d\n\nOther expected challenges will be costs for development of a new corporation yard site to move out of the current site in the Loma Rica area, reconfiguration of the Wayne Brown Correctional Center and continuing consolidation of the Health and Human Services departments.\n\nThe county jail reconfiguration is needed because there are more female inmates, and more inmates with substance abuse and mental health issues, Haffey added.\n\nOther expenses will include roads projects in Loma Rica and library kiosks in North San Juan and Chicago Park.\n\nThe county is also anticipating costs of $600,000 for completion of the Gold Country Lenders trial, which goes into closing arguments today.\n\nTo contact Staff Writer Keri Brenner, email kbrenner@theunion.com or call 530-477-4239.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Nevada County\u2019s recovery from the recession is moving along \u2014 although it may take another year to get up to speed, county officials said Tuesday.\u201cThe county\u2019s financial picture is", "og": {"url": "http://www.TheUnion.com/news/16620024-113/nevada-county-inching-toward-economic-recovery-proposed-2015-16", "image": {"identifier": "http://www.TheUnion.com/csp/mediapool/sites/TheUnion/assets/img/facebook-thumbnail-1200.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg"}, "site_name": "The Union", "description": "Nevada County\u2019s recovery from the recession is moving along \u2014 although it may take another year to get up to speed, county officials said Tuesday.\u201cThe county\u2019s financial picture is", "title": "Nevada County inching toward economic recovery, proposed 2015-16 budget indicates | TheUnion.com"}, "twitter": {"site": "@TheUnion", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 565424183476729}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 16620024}}, "__sync_contentCategory": "Free", "keywords": "COUNTY, BUDGET, NEVADA, MILLION, 2015-16, PROPOSED, HAFFEY, JUNE, MEETING, POLT", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd12e3\"", "article_summary": "To see Nevada County proposed 2015-16 budget, go to www.mynevadacounty.com and type in \u201cbudget portal\u201d in the search box.\nNevada County\u2019s recovery from the recession is moving along \u2014 although it may take another year to get up to speed, county officials said Tuesday.\n\u201cThe county\u2019s financial picture is stable and strong, with some challenges,\u201d said Nevada County Executive Officer Rick Haffey.\nThe proposed plan calls for 778 county employees, down from the 783 in 2014-15.\nOn Tuesday, Haffey and Martin Polt, chief financial officer, presented highlights of the proposed budget, which has been in the works for the last five months."}
