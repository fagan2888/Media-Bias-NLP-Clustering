( Andy Cross / The Denver Post )\n\nMORRISON \u2014 It used to be a big deal to reach 300 mph at Bandimere Speedway, the most elevated drag strip of its kind. Nowadays, drivers are ripping off 310-plus mph runs like your average tee shot in the middle of the fairway.\n\n\"In 1,000 feet too,\" top fuel veteran Larry Dixon said, reminding us that the NHRA's two nitro classes used to compete on a quarter-mile track (1,380 feet).\n\nDixon, a three-time world champion who has been racing at Bandimere since 1995, said technology and competitive people are responsible for taking mile-high racing to levels that used to be deemed impossible. He takes responsibility.\n\n\"As a competitor, that's your job,\" Dixon said Saturday after securing the top fuel pole position for today's eliminations at the 36th Mopar Mile-High Nationals. \"It's the competition that drives the speed.\"\n\nDixon ripped off a 3.791-second run Friday at a top speed of 326.63, just a smidge behind Brittany Force's 326.95 mph. The bigger numbers are meaningless \u2014 qualifying is based only on elapsed time \u2014 but they're the big sellers. Pound for pound, the Mile-Highs are one of Colorado's most successful veteran sports events, where beauty hosts the beasts.\n\n\"This racetrack is a great racetrack,\" Dixon said of his first No. 1 qualifying effort since 2011. \"Maybe next year you might see somebody run 330.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDixon, 48, is looking for his 63rd career event victory today.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.timescall.com/sports/ci_28539681/coming-at-over-300-mph-at-nhra-mile", "modificationDate": "2015-07-25T22:19:30-0600", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/0725/20150725__26TCS_DRAG~1_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By Mike Chambers \n \n  The Denver Post", "description": "MORRISON \u2014 It used to be a big deal to reach 300 mph at Bandi- mere Speedway, the most elevated drag strip of its kind.", "ag": {"canon": "LongmontTimes-Call:article:28539681:view"}, "startDate": "2015-07-26T01:00:00-0600", "og": {"url": "http://www.timescall.com/sports/ci_28539681/coming-at-over-300-mph-at-nhra-mile", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/0725/20150725__26TCS_DRAG~1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "MORRISON \u2014 It used to be a big deal to reach 300 mph at Bandi- mere Speedway, the most elevated drag strip of its kind.", "title": "Coming in at over 300 mph at NHRA Mile-High Nationals"}, "twitter": {"domain": "timescall.com", "description": "MORRISON \u2014 It used to be a big deal to reach 300 mph at Bandi- mere Speedway, the most elevated drag strip of its kind.", "title": "Coming in at over 300 mph at NHRA Mile-High Nationals", "url": "http://www.timescall.com/sports/ci_28539681/coming-at-over-300-mph-at-nhra-mile", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/0725/20150725__26TCS_DRAG~1.jpg", "site": "@TimesCall", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-07-26T01:00:00-0600", "sailthru.site": "timescall.com", "endDate": "2025-07-26T01:00:00-0600", "sailthru.title": "Coming in at over 300 mph at NHRA Mile-High Nationals", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Sports", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "lLtD9ZooxmJUEEdRSCVzkO06t_hYKtyDqZF7EA3N2U0", "byline": "By Mike ChambersThe", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/0725/20150725__26TCS_DRAG~1.jpg", "pubDate": "2015-07-25T22:20:05-0600", "news_keywords": "Sports, Sports news, Longmont Colorado Sports news, Longmont Colorado news, Sports Longmont news, Sports Colorado news, US Sports news, world Sports news."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9f7e\"", "article_summary": "( Andy Cross / The Denver Post )MORRISON \u2014 It used to be a big deal to reach 300 mph at Bandimere Speedway, the most elevated drag strip of its kind.\nNowadays, drivers are ripping off 310-plus mph runs like your average tee shot in the middle of the fairway.\nDixon ripped off a 3.791-second run Friday at a top speed of 326.63, just a smidge behind Brittany Force's 326.95 mph.\n\"As a competitor, that's your job,\" Dixon said Saturday after securing the top fuel pole position for today's eliminations at the 36th Mopar Mile-High Nationals.\n\"In 1,000 feet too,\" top fuel veteran Larry Dixon said, reminding us that the NHRA's two nitro classes used to compete on a quarter-mile track (1,380 feet)."}
