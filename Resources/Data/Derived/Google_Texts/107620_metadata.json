The mandate will force small employers to rebuff workers they would hire in its absence, and it will incentivize large employers to replace full-time employees with part-timers. When conservative policy experts and business groups first pointed this out, however, Obamacare supporters robotically recited the usual canards about close-fisted capitalists who value profit more than healthy employees. But a funny thing happened on the way to the midterms \u2014 the President delayed implementation of the mandate until after the election.\n\nWhy, if it presents no potential harm to workers or the economy, would the President defer implementation of this particular provision of Obamacare? The answer, of course, is that the pain inflicted by the mandate on real people would inevitably hurt the Democrats next November. His congressional accomplices thus went to the White House and implored him to save their sorry political hides, whereupon he reluctantly and illegally delayed the mandate\u2019s go-live date. This, however, put Obamacare\u2019s pimps into something of a bind. Having assured the public that conservative warnings about the mandate amounted to little more than fear mongering, they were suddenly obliged execute a dizzying verbal pirouette.\n\nNow they sound a lot like those knuckle-dragging conservatives and greedy capitalists they once denounced. Timothy Jost, longtime pitchman for the President\u2019s \u201creform\u201d law, is a typical example. In a recent post for the Health Affairs blog, Jost admitted the following: \u201cSmall employers approaching the 50-employee threshold have reportedly constrained growth to avoid becoming subject to the mandate. Some employers have cut the hours of part-time employees to below 30 to avoid having to offer them coverage.\u201d Sound familiar? Jost then forces his hapless readers to slog through another zillion or so turgid paragraphs before he finally gets to the point: the employer mandate must be repealed and replaced.\n\nBut the real death knell for the employer mandate came last month, when the left-leaning Urban Institute published a report titled, \u201cWhy Not Just Eliminate the Employer Mandate?\u201d Like Jost\u2019s windy piece, the report gives one a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, an eerie feeling that we have been here before: \u201cCreating arbitrary thresholds (e.g., potential penalties for firms of 50 or more workers not providing coverage for employees typically working 30 or more hours per week) for financial requirements will change the employment decisions\u2026 and at least some workers will be adversely affected by them.\u201d In the lethargic lexicon of the liberal think tank, \u201csome workers will be adversely affected\u201d means \u201cfamine and pestilence.\u201d\n\nAnd it gets worse. The people who would suffer the worst consequences of the employer mandate are low-skilled, low income Americans. The mandate, if implemented, will require all employers with more than 50 employees to offer insurance to full-time workers \u2014 or pay fines. But not all employers with 50 employees can afford to offer insurance. And, as the Urban Institute puts it, \u201cBecause the non-offering firms are much more likely to be firms dominated by low-wage workers, low-wage employees will bear the greatest brunt of the penalties imposed.\u201d In other words, the government-imposed costs of a company\u2019s noncompliance will fall back on the low-income employees who can least afford to absorb them.\n\nThe Urban Institute report has finally caught the attention of the liberal media, and a variety of Obama-friendly outlets have produced editorials either advocating the repeal of the employer mandate or at least speculating on the feasibility of doing so. In this they are actually well behind a progressive writer about whom many conservatives, including your truly, have been less than kind. Ezra Klein, of all people, came out forcefully against the employer mandate last year. He wrote an uncharacteristically honest blog post titled, \u201cObamacare\u2019s employer mandate shouldn\u2019t be delayed. It should be repealed,\u201d in which he pointed out that \u201cthe mandate gives employers a reason to have fewer full-time workers, and fewer low-income workers.\u201d\n\nIf the thing is so bad that a dyed-in-the-wool Obamacare cheerleader like Ezra Klein denounces it, one can be sure that it needs to go overboard. So, what happens if the employer mandate is indeed repealed? According to the Urban Institute study, the negative impact would be minimal: \u201cThe number with employer coverage falls by 500,000, a relative decrease of 0.3 percent.\u201d And a portion of that number would offset by other types of coverage. Many would get coverage via non-group policies and a much smaller number would end up on Medicaid. \u201cThe number of uninsured increases by about 200,000 people, a relative increase of 0.6 percent.\u201d In other words, getting rid of the mandate would have almost no effect on patients.\n\nThe Urban Institute report concludes thus: \u201cIn summary, eliminating the employer mandate would eliminate labor market distortions in law, lessen opposition to the law from employers, and have little effect on coverage.\u201d Thus, Obama-friendly publications like the Los Angeles Times ask, \u201cShould we kill Obamacare\u2019s employer mandate?\u201d Conservatives have known the correct answer for years. It is YES! If progressive think tanks, liberal publications, and high-profile lefties have finally come around to the conservative position, we should take advantage of this unusual consensus. Kill the bloody thing now.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 1742097289343962}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "generator": "WordPress 4.4"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd80fe\"", "article_summary": "Conservatives have long known that Obamacare\u2019s employer mandate, if implemented, will create harmful distortions in the labor market and damage the economy.\nHe wrote an uncharacteristically honest blog post titled, \u201cObamacare\u2019s employer mandate shouldn\u2019t be delayed.\nThe people who would suffer the worst consequences of the employer mandate are low-skilled, low income Americans.\nEzra Klein, of all people, came out forcefully against the employer mandate last year.\nSo, what happens if the employer mandate is indeed repealed?"}
