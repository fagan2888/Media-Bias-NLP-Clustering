Bay District Schools' Transportation Department is preparing a new bus routing system.

Officials say it should make the bus ride to and from school easier on parents and bus drivers.

The Versatrans system will provide routing data showing each route's efficiency over time.

It will also allow officials to quickly re-route buses in case of an accident or road block.

Parents will also have access to an e-link so they can track the route of their child's bus in real time.

If a bus is running late, parents will be able to see an estimated time of arrival.

Officials hope to launch the program over winter break in December.

"It's taking a longer period of time because we're considered a larger district. Smaller districts that use Versatran typically install it within 90 days, but we're considered a larger district because we have upwards of 25,000 students or more, therefore it's taking a little bit longer to install and get all the software loaded and do other things that need to be done," Bay District Schools Director of Operational Services Dr. John Haley said.

Haley says Versatran will be more user-friendly for both parents and operations staff.
