How will patients be affected by these reductions?\n\n\n\n\u00b7 Why is government targeting this crucial benefit that is working well and helping to keep 415,000 Americans alive?\n\n\n\nAs patients and patient advocates for people with kidney failure, we are deeply concerned about the impact these cuts will have on patient care. Of the more than 415,000 Americans with irreversible kidney failure who receive dialysis, 85 percent depend on Medicare\u2019s dialysis benefit to pay for their treatments. The proposed cuts would slash reimbursement per dialysis treatment by $24 from $240 to $216 per treatment.\n\n\n\n\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAgain, the question: Why would federal officials recommend cuts this drastic when the nonpartisan independent advisory commission (MedPAC) that oversees Medicare estimated Medicare margins between 3-4 percent. Further, MedPAC recently told policymakers it is premature to make changes in dialysis funding. The numbers just don't add up. So with the level of CMS\u2019 proposed cuts at nearly ten percent, the math simply does not work.Who will suffer? Patients, no doubt.Medicare coverage for kidney care encompasses much more than just the dialysis treatment. Quality kidney care includes a wide range of supportive services and therapies, including nutritional counseling, social work, medications and lab analysis as well as supportive nursing care and technician support. If reimbursement is cut as proposed, many dialysis facilities more than likely will be forced to reduce staff, cut facility hours, or both. Programs such as nocturnal dialysis offerings \u2013 which are helpful for those with 9-to-5 jobs \u2014 could be eliminated. Patients may miss treatments as accessibility declines, jeopardizing their health, and ultimately costing the health care system more when complications arise. And for rural and certain inner city facilities with nearly 100 percent of patients on Medicare, closures and cutbacks are likely.Yes, America's kidney patients are worried. Our responsibility as this nation\u2019s leading patient advocacy organizations is to protect the interests of individuals with kidney failure. As such, we strongly urge policymakers to remember their responsibility to protect patients who depend on dialysis care by maintaining the integrity of this critical benefit. Medicare has an obligation to ensure that payments cover the actual cost of providing services to beneficiaries. During this review period, we urge policymakers to proceed with caution and revisit their proposed rule to ensure any changes do not undermine the care depended upon by so many.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "America's leading kidney patient organizations are very worried.
