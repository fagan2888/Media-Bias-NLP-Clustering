Diabetes diagnoses are often followed by serious health complications including heart disease, stroke, kidney failure, blindness, lower-extremity amputations, and premature death. A report released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has revealed that 9.3 percent of the U.S. population is currently suffering from diabetes, including one out of four people who are unaware they have the condition.\n\n\u201cThese new numbers are alarming and underscore the need for an increased focus on reducing the burden of diabetes in our country,\u201d said Dr. Ann Albright, director of the CDC\u2019s Division of Diabetes Translation, in a statement. \u201cDiabetes is costly in both human and economic terms. It\u2019s urgent that we take swift action to effectively treat and prevent this serious disease.\u201d\n\nAccording to findings from the National Diabetes Statistics Report, 2014, 29 million people in the U.S. have diabetes, including 1.7 million people over the age of 20 who were newly diagnosed in 2012. There are also currently 208,000 people under the age of 20 who have been diagnosed with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Compared to non-Hispanic white adults, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, and American Indian/Alaska Native adults were around twice as likely to be diagnosed with diabetes.\n\nAdditionally, 86 million adults over the age of 20 have prediabetes, meaning their blood sugar is higher than normal, but not high enough to constitute a diagnosis of diabetes. Rates of prediabetes diagnoses were similar among all racial backgrounds at 35 percent for non-Hispanic white, 39 percent for non-Hispanic blacks, and 38 percent for Hispanics. If preventive lifestyle changes such as increased physical activity and weight loss are not addressed, 15 to 30 percent of people with prediabetes will be diagnosed with type 2 diabetes within five years.\n\nThe CDC\u2019s report also found that diabetes and complications caused by the condition accounted for $245 billion in total medical costs and lost work wages in 2012. Diabetes is a serious and sometimes deadly medical condition, but it can be managed through appropriate insulin use, blood sugar-lowering medications, diet, and physical activity. Diabetes sufferers should also look to reduce risk factors of heart disease, including high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and tobacco use.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "diabetes, prediabetes, high, blood pressure", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "There are currently over 29 million people suffering from diabetes in the United States on top of 86 million people over the age of 20 with prediabetes.", "title": "Over 9% Of The US Population Has Been Diagnosed With Diabetes", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/29-million-people-us-have-diabetes-including-more-200000-teens-and-children-287438", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/10/diabetes.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "There are currently over 29 million people suffering from diabetes in the United States on top of 86 million people over the age of 20 with prediabetes.", "title": "Over 9% Of The US Population Has Been Diagnosed With Diabetes", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/29-million-people-us-have-diabetes-including-more-200000-teens-and-children-287438", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/10/diabetes.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/10/diabetes.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Conditions", "published_time": "2014-06-10T12:11:24-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-10T12:11:22-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "There are currently over 29 million people suffering from diabetes in the United States on top of 86 million people over the age of 20 with prediabetes."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd46f\"", "article_summary": "Diabetes sufferers should also look to reduce risk factors of heart disease, including high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and tobacco use.\nDiabetes diagnoses are often followed by serious health complications including heart disease, stroke, kidney failure, blindness, lower-extremity amputations, and premature death.\nThere are also currently 208,000 people under the age of 20 who have been diagnosed with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes.\nCompared to non-Hispanic white adults, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, and American Indian/Alaska Native adults were around twice as likely to be diagnosed with diabetes.\nIt\u2019s urgent that we take swift action to effectively treat and prevent this serious disease.\u201dAccording to findings from the National Diabetes Statistics Report, 2014, 29 million people in the U.S. have diabetes, including 1.7 million people over the age of 20 who were newly diagnosed in 2012."}
