I disagree with people like Royal A. Brown III ["Last Republican standing," April 28] who say President Barack Obama is the worst president we have ever had. People forget what other presidents did.

Examples of “bad” presidents: George W. Bush: a deserter, started war with Iraq, gave tax cuts to wealthy that eliminated surplus that Bill Clinton left. Ronald Reagan: fired air traffic controllers, instituted deregulation of businesses, started exodus of companies leaving this country.

Some examples of what President Obama has accomplished: Found and executed Osama bin Laden (Bush gave up finding him); Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act; middle class tax cuts; rescued auto industry; doubled funding for Pell Grants; signed 18 tax cuts for small businesses; Affordable Care Act; expanded access to preventive care screenings; ended insurance discrimination against 129 million Americans with pre-existing conditions; historic investments in clean energy; historic action to protect our environment;and stopped the building of the Keystone XL pipeline, which would have devastated our environment.

How can these accomplishments make him the worst president?

I could go on listing President Obama's accomplishments and his compromises that Republicans refused to consider. I challenge people to back up accusations with facts. Please note that no president is perfect. What a president can accomplish depends on the Congress that backs him.

For the last six years we have had a do-nothing Congress. Recently Republicans have refused to do their constitutional duty to conduct hearings on a Supreme Court justice nomination. They are the ones not doing their job.

I implore all voters to keep things like this in mind when voting in the upcoming elections. It is not just the president who gets things done; it is also the Congress. So vote all the do-nothings out.
