With Round 5 of the Wrangler National Finals Rodeo behind her, and the competition half-way over, Kassidy Dennison, a barrel racer from Tohatchi, New Mexico, took a quick break from the competition to talk about her Navajo heritage.

“It’s huge honor to not only represent myself and my people, but tribes across the world,” Dennison told RodeoVideo.com about being the first Navajo woman to compete at the WNFR in barrel racing. “It’s a big honor to be here.” And when the 22-year-old won Round 3 of competition on December 6, she took a victory lap around the arena and saw Navajo flags raised to salute her. The icing on the cake, perhaps, for a young woman who’s dreamed of competing in the rodeo her whole life.

”[It’s] awesome to represent both sides,” Dennison said about her unique clash of cultures.
