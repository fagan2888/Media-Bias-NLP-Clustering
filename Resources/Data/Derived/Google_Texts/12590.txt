As of Jan. 1, 750 doctors will be removed from health insurance company Emblem Health. The removal has attracted controversy, mainly due to the fact that the change is arriving courtesy of a payment overhaul from ObamaCare. The decision was defended by Emblem Health CEO Karen Ignani, who, in a letter to the Department of Financial Services, claimed that the reduction covers a mere 2 percent of doctors in the company’s network. According to Ignani, the change will “improve the outcomes of our members and contribute to the creation of a better health-care system in New York.” Ignani also decried the previous billing system, which, in her view, “rewarded volume, not value, for patients.”

This did not prevent others from voicing their objections, however.

“They’re taking away the rights and choices from patients,” Michael Goldstein, the President of New York County Medical Society, said. “This is bad for patients, bad for doctors, bad for health care.”

Goldstein’s organization has asked the Cuomo administration to intervene, according to reportage by The New York Post.com.
