Trends also show a slowdown: Over the first quarter of the year, there was an average monthly gain of 86,000 employed older workers, down sharply from a peak of almost 300,000 two years earlier.\n\n\u201cIt is possible that the [Affordable Care Act] is allowing many of these workers to retire early now that they can get health care insurance outside of employment,\u201d said Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research.\n\nIt will be a few years before the ACA\u2019s full labor-market impact is seen, he added.\n\n\u201cI think a drop in employment of 2% among older workers is certainly plausible,\u201d Baker said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see something among younger workers as well, primarily parents of small children.\u201d\n\nHowever, Baker warned that the data are volatile, and it\u2019s still early days in the ACA\u2019s implementation, so observers should be careful about drawing firm conclusions from March\u2019s data.\n\nAlso of note, the unemployment rate for older workers ticked up last month to 4.7% from 4.6% in February, indicating that some workers were involuntarily out of a job.\n\n\u2013Ruth Mantell\n\nFollow Ruth on Twitter @RuthMantell\n\nFollow the Capitol Report blog on Twitter @CapitolReport\n\nCheck out these Capitol Report posts:\n\nNumber of long-term jobless drops by 110,000 in March\n\nHouse passes bill to change definition of full-time job", "article_metadata": {"article.author": "MarketWatch", "description": "The number of employed older workers fell last month, possibly a sign that President Obama\u2019s law reforming health care is enabling them to leave their jobs, a prominent left-leaning economist said Friday.", "application-name": "MarketWatch.com", "article.id": "BL-MWEB-5725", "og": {"site_name": "Marketwatch", "description": "The number of employed older workers fell last month, possibly a sign that President Obama\u2019s law reforming health care is enabling them to leave their jobs, a prominent left-leaning economist said Friday.", "title": "Jobs data may signal health-care reform is helping older workers to retire: economist", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/capitolreport/2014/04/04/jobs-data-may-signal-health-care-reform-is-helping-older-workers-to-retire-economist/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DR328_mw_soc_NS_20150801233302.png", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Marketwatch.com", "description": "The number of employed older workers fell last month, possibly a sign that President Obama\u2019s law reforming health care is enabling them to leave their jobs, a prominent left-leaning economist said Friday.", "title": "Jobs data may signal health-care reform is helping older workers to retire: economist", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/capitolreport/2014/04/04/jobs-data-may-signal-health-care-reform-is-helping-older-workers-to-retire-economist/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DR328_mw_soc_NS_20150801233302.png"}, "site": "MarketWatch", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.published": "2014-04-04T11:40:21-04:00", "article.access": "free", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "msapplication-tooltip": "MarketWatch", "article.type": "Capitol Report", "article.page": "Capitol Report Blog", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/capitolreport/2014/04/04/jobs-data-may-signal-health-care-reform-is-helping-older-workers-to-retire-economist/", "app_id": 283204329838}, "article.created": "2014-04-04T11:40:21-04:00", "article.updated": "2014-04-04T13:26:42-04:00", "keywords": "ACA,employment,Older workers", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch", "image_count": 2}, "article.section": "Blogs", "article.headline": "Jobs data may signal health-care reform is helping older workers to retire: economist", "msapplication-task": "name=SmartMoney;action-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/;icon-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/favicon.ico", "news_keywords": "ACA,employment,Older workers"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe108e\"", "article_summary": "The number of employed older workers fell last month, possibly a sign that President Obama\u2019s law reforming health care is enabling them to leave their jobs, a prominent left-leaning economist said Friday.\n\u201cI think a drop in employment of 2% among older workers is certainly plausible,\u201d Baker said.\nTrends also show a slowdown: Over the first quarter of the year, there was an average monthly gain of 86,000 employed older workers, down sharply from a peak of almost 300,000 two years earlier.\nAlso of note, the unemployment rate for older workers ticked up last month to 4.7% from 4.6% in February, indicating that some workers were involuntarily out of a job.\nLast month the number of employed workers who were at least 55-years old fell by 133,000, the largest drop in half a year, according to U.S. Labor Department data."}
