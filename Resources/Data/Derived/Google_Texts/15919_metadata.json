Planned Parenthood denies the accusations that it profits from the sales of fetal body parts.\n\nLangenberg said people needed to spread the word that women have a choice. \u201cAbortion hurts women,\u201d she said.\n\nIn the clinic\u2019s parking lot, Stacy Sherrod said she was concerned about the \u201chyperfocus\u201d on abortion in this debate, and worries that people\u2019s attention is being drawn away from the other services that Planned Parenthood provides, such as health care and birth control.\n\nBuy Photo Stacy Sherrod said she\u2019s worried about the \"hyperfocus\" on abortion in this debate to defund Planned Parenthood. (Photo: Trevor Mitchell/News-Leader)\n\n\u201cThey do more to prevent abortions than any clinic in town,\u201d Sherrod said.\n\nBefore the institution of the Affordable Care Act, Sherrod said all of her health care needs were met at the clinic \u2014 and they were essential when she had a breast cancer scare.\n\nAlexander Johnson, a past intern with Planned Parenthood, said two transgender people had spoken earlier about the inclusivity they experienced at the clinic \u2014 something they weren\u2019t finding at other health care providers around the city.\n\nBuy Photo Alexander Johnson talked about two cancer patients he says Planned Parenthood made cancer survivors. (Photo: Trevor Mitchell/News-Leader)\n\nHe also said he it was a lifeline for lower-class citizens of Springfield, who couldn\u2019t find care anywhere else.\n\n\u201cI understand where they\u2019re coming from,\u201d Johnson said of the protestors. \u201cWhen you have a moral point of view, it\u2019s very hard to see another moral point of view.\u201d\n\nJohnson said abortions \u2014 which are not a service provided by the Springfield clinic \u2014 make up only 3 percent of what Planned Parenthood does.\n\n\u201cThey want to make the abortions they do unnecessary,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nThe Brandon family doesn\u2019t see it that way. Holding signs that read \u201cHearts lungs and livers? P.P. Delivers\u201d and \u201cPlanned Parenthood sells baby parts for $$,\u201d they said they hoped to be the last protesters out, even as rain poured down.\n\n\u201cWhat they\u2019re doing is wrong,\u201d said Susan Brandon. \u201cThey\u2019re using federal funding to murder babies.\u201d\n\nAs the last protesters left, cars driving down Battlefield occasionally honked in support, and Planned Parenthood supporters, clad in pink plastic ponchos, retreated back inside the clinic.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not mad at them for their opinions,\u201d Johnson said, looking at the few protesters left. \u201cI want them to know that Planned Parenthood is a vital part of the community.\u201d\n\nSusan Brandon didn\u2019t agree. \u201cYou can receive health care anywhere else.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: http://sgfnow.co/1JcGpmm", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "The early-morning protest was cut short by rain, but people still made their voices heard", "og": {"site_name": "Springfield News-Leader", "description": "The early-morning protest was cut short by rain, but people still made their voices heard", "title": "More than 100 gather in Springfield to protest or support Planned Parenthood", "url": "http://www.news-leader.com/story/news/local/ozarks/2015/08/22/gather-springfield-protest-support-planned-parenthood/32202983/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/news-leader.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The early-morning protest was cut short by rain, but people still made their voices heard", "title": "More than 100 gather in Springfield to protest or support Planned Parenthood", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/933cfa99cd532e2647953828fd815c3f09bf240d/c=75-0-525-450&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/08/22/Springfield/B9318556387Z.1_20150822213416_000_G04BMRNUC.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@springfieldNL", "site": "@springfieldNL", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=805766992", "fb": {"app_id": 164654783578465}, "article": {"author": "Trevor Mitchell"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8b4a\"", "article_summary": "Katie Langenberg said it was the recent undercover videos released about Planned Parenthood \u2014 which show staff discussing fetal tissue donations.\nPlanned Parenthood denies the accusations that it profits from the sales of fetal body parts.\n\u201cI want them to know that Planned Parenthood is a vital part of the community.\u201dSusan Brandon didn\u2019t agree.\nBuy Photo Stacy Sherrod said she\u2019s worried about the \"hyperfocus\" on abortion in this debate to defund Planned Parenthood.\nBuy Photo Alexander Johnson talked about two cancer patients he says Planned Parenthood made cancer survivors."}
