Weiwei pauses, his hand resting on his dog\u2019s back.\n\n\u201cYou know, sometimes they actually tried to make my conditions better,\u201d he says quietly, almost to himself. \u201cOnce, after two days I couldn\u2019t shit. Normally, every day I shit. Regularly. I go to the toilet every day. I said, \u2018I need a banana.\u2019 They gave me a banana but it was totally black. I joked: \u2018It must be from the Beijing Cave.\u2019 You know: Beijing has a cave with fossils of monkeys that are supposed to have evolved into human beings. It\u2019s called Beijing Cave. These are the earliest signs of Chinese people. He laughed and said, \u2018I\u2019m sorry we don\u2019t have any more bananas. This is the only banana we have left.\u2019 But after that he started to routinely bring me bananas and oranges.\u201d\n\n\u2018This is the man who looked like a professor?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. Because this man, although he is definitely kind of arrogant, he\u2019s a little bit proud of himself as well. He said, \u2018I smoke but I never take a cigarette from someone else.\u2019 He\u2019s not, how you say, corrupted.\u201d\n\nI found this incredible. I had assumed that the sort of people who work as secret policemen, and definitely as interrogators, must be ideologically pure \u2013 two-dimensional even \u2013 like characters in a Hollywood movie. As I listened, I couldn\u2019t help wondering if Weiwei\u2019s judgement had become compromised. Perhaps this was a sort of variation of the Stockholm Syndrome that one might expect him to suffer. I pressed him repeatedly on this: surely, I asked, some of the people who dealt with him must have had the zeal and the values of the Red Guards \u2013 the fanatical young supporters of Mao who would think nothing of beating their ideological opponents to death.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m talking about the place I was in for the first fourteen days,\u201d Weiwei says. \u201cAt the very end of the fourteen days both of the men had become soft. They started telling me they had given up. One of them said, \u2018I cannot interrogate you, Wei-wei. I would rather interrogate a murderer or a thief. I cannot do this any more.'\u201d\n\n\u201cBut do you think this transformation was genuine? Or were they trying to trick you?\u201d\n\n\u201cLater I found out it was genuine. They were telling me the truth. But at that moment I thought, well, maybe this is just a tactic.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat happened at the end of this first fourteen days then?\u201d\n\n\u201cOn day fourteen the interrogator came in and said, \u2018Weiwei, the rest will be even more difficult. You may be transferred to many bad places that are much worse than here. You will remember your time here and wish you could come back. But you have to have patience. You have to be strong and have patience.\u2019 I tried to capture every word they said. You want to save them because it is so strange they are saying these words to you. But you also don\u2019t know precisely what they mean. These two interrogators just suddenly disappeared, which was a big surprise. They thought they would be doing the whole case. In their mind, they told me they would. They said, \u2018We want this to be finished fast. We never imagined a case can be like this, but we can\u2019t tell you the details because we\u2019re not allowed.\u2019The main one, the Professor, was very sorry when he left, he touched my shoulder. Then four guys suddenly came in and said, \u2018Time for you to move.\u2019 They were all dressed in black suits. They stood, one of them in each corner of the room and then one of them said, \u2018Stand up. Where are your belongings?\u2019 They covered my face and I was driven off and moved to another place. Now I was in a military compound. There were two soldiers in front of me.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you arrived, you were in what vehicle?\u201d\n\n\u201cA van. Something like a Buick. Three rows of seats.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd your hood comes off again only when you are finally sitting on the chair?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. They take me out a few times but always covered so you don\u2019t know what is beyond the door.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do you know it\u2019s an army base then?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe soldiers are in the uniforms of Tiananmen Square. They walk like a performance. They are like robots. Every movement, even the smallest movement is like that. If they want to change position, they stamp their feet like robots. Like badly designed robots. What immediately came to my mind was the movie \u201cBlade Runner.\u201d There is a guy in the movie who likes to design little robots. They walk, hit the door, spin round, walk off again, hit the wall. It\u2019s just like that. But of course it\u2019s deadly serious.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo now what did you feel?\u201d\n\n\u201cI understood that was what the interrogator had been trying to tell me. Because, you know, this was a completely different kind of condition, a whole set of different principles.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you must have suddenly looked back on the first fourteen days as being better?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. It is not nice to find yourself in an army base at all. It is terrifying, really another level of fear. I was very afraid that they would now use other techniques \u2013 techniques that I have heard about from other people who were arrested. I wouldn\u2019t say I hate the army . . . but yes, I really do hate the army because I hate any kind of army because it is the most inhuman way of organizing people. You are into the hands of people only nineteen, twenty years old. But later I found out it\u2019s not so bad because everything is so regulated, so empty, so abstract. If you behave in this condition you are perfectly fine. They completely don\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on. They\u2019re doing their job just like the guards in front of the big gate at Tiananmen. \u2018You cannot come in,\u2019 they shout. You say anything else to them and they just shout \u2018You cannot come in!\u2019 Trained to do only one thing and incapable of doing anything else. But for the first week or ten days I was so terrified.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut where were you kept?\u201d\n\n\u201cAgain, a room. A kind of hotel room. But this room looked so funny because everything was covered with soft cushions.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou mean it was a comfortable room?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, to prevent suicide I think.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh \u2013 I see: a padded room.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. That\u2019s the word: padded. But so badly taped and everything. Very badly. Soft foam everywhere.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe walls? The floor?\u201d\n\n\u201cEverywhere. Even the water taps. You turn on the water and the foam around the taps is so dirty because of the moisture. Even the toilet. After a while the foam gets loose, they re-tape it. After a while the wall becomes curved, where it sags because it is so old. But you can\u2019t touch anything anyway. You have two guards. All the time. Twenty-four hours a day. When you sleep they sit there and they\u2019re not like police. The police, they like phones. They play phone games and they\u2019re a little bit loose, you realize later, because when you have soldiers, even at midnight they are still like this: stiff like brooms. They cannot doze but they are so sleepy because their minds are so empty. And sometimes they would argue. One would say, \u2018You cannot blink your eyes!\u2019 And the other said, \u2018You did, not me!\u2019 Because there\u2019s two cameras watching the room all the time and if either one of the guards is caught, if they are found to be sleeping or blinking, they\u2019re both in serious trouble. The two cameras can blow up their eyes to the size of a wall. So the cameras can really see if they doze. You realize they are soldiers but they too are just like criminals. They are really being highly watched. Even when they come out of my room they are searched. There\u2019s two other soldiers whose job it is to search them . . . They cannot talk to you. They cannot talk to each other. The whole day is silent until someone comes to interrogate you. The silence is exhausting. Being silent with other people in the room. And when you go to pee you have to raise your hand and say, \u2018Sir I need a pee.\u2019 They have to say yes before you can even stand up. Then you can stand up but they have to go with you, in this tiny room. One person before you, one behind. One goes to the bathroom door. He stamps his feet and turns round and looks at you and then goes backwards into the bathroom. Then you go in. Between the two of them. The other one follows you in. Stamp, stamp. Then you start to pee. Then they look at your dick because, you know, they have to make sure it\u2019s really a dick. It\u2019s true! This is their regulation and there\u2019s also a camera in the bathroom. They are being watched. After peeing you report to the soldier, \u2018Sir, I have to wash my hands.\u2019 If you don\u2019t say anything they say, \u2018Report!\u2019 So you say, \u2018Report, sir, I have finished washing my hands. Can I go out?\u2019 They say yes, then one goes backwards. Stamp. You go backwards and again the other one stamps feet and follows. This is total full protection. You cannot make any single strange move.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow close were they?\u201d\n\nWeiwei moves his chair towards me. Now his face is forty or fifty centimeters away from mine. Already it feels very uncomfortable.\n\n\u201cThis close. And if you do like this \u2013\u201d Weiwei wobbles \u2013 \u201cthey immediately jump. They say to me, \u2018If you hit the ground I will be in jail, in your position.\u2019 But there\u2019s so many stories . . . It\u2019s another world. They are just nineteen-year-old boys. Before they come to the camp, they are in places where there is no electricity. They are farmers\u2019 sons. No toilet.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do you know? You can talk to them?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe develop techniques for talking. They change shifts every three hours and every time when their shift came to an end I could see that it was such a relief for them and always as the end of the shift was approaching, they would always keep looking at their watches and muttering, \u2018Fuck! They\u2019re late.\u2019 They would do this even though the next shift might only be late by one minute. Even one minute was too long to bear; it would make them so frustrated, it would make them so mad, \u2018Fuck! They\u2019re late again. Fuck.\u2019 Because they are so desperate to escape the prison cell as well \u2013 they\u2019re almost as desperate as I am. They signed up to the army for two years when they were still so young and as soon as they become soldiers they have to do so much daily exercise. It\u2019s very hard. They have to run five kilometers in less than twenty minutes with all the gear and then there\u2019s lots of physical training. Then they have to come and sit in this room and for two years literally they never leave this army camp. There\u2019s no vacation, no Sunday, no Saturday; they can only call their family for ten minutes each week, in front of the whole army, with no privacy.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre they conscripts or volunteers?\u201d\n\n\u201cFirst two years they are volunteer soldiers. They are paid less than forty dollars a month. They join up because they are from such poor areas. In those parts of China, life is so hard. Before they arrived at the army they would never have seen a toilet. There\u2019s no electricity, there\u2019s no toilet sheets, I mean the paper, they just use newspaper or whatever comes to their hands; leaves, rocks, whatever. Then they see on the television some advert or something \u2013 a movie \u2013 so they start to admire the army uniform and they start to say, \u2018One day I want to be a soldier.\u2019 But now they are so miserable. They\u2019re just farmers\u2019 children. They feel very sad. All the time they become ill because of the training. Their bones make noises when they move, cracking everywhere because they have to stand all day. They have problems with their backs and they have problems with their legs but they always have to stand to attention. They are not allowed to talk to me. If they do that it would be a very severe crime. They can be removed immediately. They are not supposed to reveal what their names are or where they come from but because they are only eighteen or nineteen they start to talk to me. They are curious. They have so much curiosity.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do they do this?\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything happens during the period when I walk around the room or when I am lying on the bed pretending to sleep. They develop this technology \u2013 not technology \u2013 I mean they develop this technique. They talk to me without moving their lips. They talk like this, like a, how you say, like a ventriloquist. They have to look at me but they are not allowed to look at each other and I am forbidden to look at them, even for a second. But when I am walking round the room and they are walking next to me, guarding me in this tiny room, we talk without moving our lips. Of course I have to hold my pants because I don\u2019t have any belt and my button is already loose. I walk, holding my pants round and round in circles and they march next to me. They have to march and stamp their feet when they turn. It\u2019s crazy. I keep asking them if they\ufffccan just put in a few stitches, so I don\u2019t have to hold it. They could never even agree to that simple request. Every time they said, \u2018We have to check. We have to report to our leader; report about the loose button and see if anything can be done.\u2019 Every day they walk with me in this military fashion, every turn, every move, maybe even just one step, all very precisely done. Clicking their heels. It\u2019s so ridiculous but they have to do it. The camera is watching them so they have to do that. They are being examined. And they keep telling me, \u2018Don\u2019t just think about you; think about us. We\u2019re still young and we have no criminal record but we are just as much a prisoner as you are.\u2019 Then they say, \u2018The first day I arrived in the army I so regretted coming. I realized it was such a big mistake.\u2019 Someone\u2019s watching them all the time but they keep telling me these stories. They keep saying to me, \u2018You sleep, we have to stand to attention next to your bed. You eat, we have to stand next to you. You shit, you take a shower, we have to stand there. What crime did we ever commit?\u2019 They don\u2019t understand what has happened. One day, I noticed that one of them was sad and I said, \u2018Why do you feel so sad today?\u2019 He said, \u2018Because the person I look up to, the person I respect . . .\u2019 How do you call that?\u201d\n\n\u201cA mentor?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. A mentor. He said, \u2018I am sad because my mentor has died.\u2019 I thought: What? But he\u2019s a farmer\u2019s son. How can he have a mentor? I said, \u2018Who is your mentor?\u2019 \u2018Bin Laden,\u2019 he said. \u2018He was killed by the Americans.\u2019 That day was May 2. I was completely shocked. It was incredible. I was not supposed to know any information from outside and this guy was telling me that bin Laden had just been killed by Americans! I said, \u2018He\u2019s not your mentor.\u2019 But he said, \u2018I respect him. I hate Americans.\u2019 They all say they hate Americans but they don\u2019t really hate Americans. They love American songs, they love whatever Americans do but they\u2019ve been told Americans are brutal, crazy, inhuman. But you can sense this military education . . . but you can sense this whole military education.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, it was sixty-six days you spent there. Was there a third place?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I stayed there till the end. I stayed almost seventy days in there.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho were the interrogators?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe guy at the army camp was about my age and you can see that he grew up during the Cultural Revolution.\u201d\n\n\u201cWas he a soldier?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. He was a soldier once, now a policeman. Many policemen were soldiers before. He was a very hardcore type of person.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you meet him on the first day?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. After two days. The first interrogator came to tell me: \u2018Weiwei, this guy will replace my work, my job. He will be the one to take over.'\u201d\n\n\u201cWas he uniformed?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, plainclothes. He likes to wear shirts like me. But they always have bright colours printed on them. And big English words, very sporty \u2013 but I\u2019m sure he doesn\u2019t understand one single word of what they say.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is his accent?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s from the northeast. Dongbei. That\u2019s a sign. Because normally Beijing police are Beijing people. When somebody\u2019s not from Beijing they must have been in the army.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd during this second period, on the army base, were the interrogators more resolute?\u201d\n\n\u201cThis guy at the army base was a real gung-ho person and was leader of the team. They have a team of four or five people.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a police team?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. It\u2019s a Beijing police team. The military police. APF, that\u2019s Armed Police Force. Their job is just to do the capture. They know nothing about the case.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the Beijing police force is responsible for the interrogation?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut during the second period you didn\u2019t find the same sympathy among the interrogators?\u201d\n\n\u201cLater I did. But not at first. The interrogator who came in was so stylish, so self-conscious. He questions me but of course you can see that mentally he has no idea about political crimes or art. They know nothing about art.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. How did they deal with your art?\u201d\n\n\u201cAt the beginning he was yelling, very mad. I said, \u2018Why are you doing that? Why do you have to raise your voice so high?\u2019 He looks at me like I\u2019m a criminal or something. Then gradually he became calm. I can sense that they are all so frustrated with the situation. Firstly, they don\u2019t understand art. Especially they don\u2019t understand my kind of art. They have no idea why Sunflower Seeds is art. He shouted at me, \u2018Why do you think the twelve animal heads from Yuan Ming Yuan are your work?'\u201d\n\nThe work the interrogator was referring to was the circle of giant animal heads that Weiwei had cast in bronze. They were inspired by twelve animal heads that had acted as fountains in the old Summer Palace in Beijing. Each head was an animal from the Chinese zodiac. Anything to do with the Summer Palace, which was burnt to the ground in 1860 by invading French and British soldiers, is a lightning rod for Chinese nationalism. Weiwei points out that the ruling Qing dynasty were not actually Han Chinese (being descendants of Manchurian invaders) and the designers of the original heads were also foreigners (Jesuits), as were the craftsmen who cast the figures.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s impossible for them to understand. So I have to do a lot of explanation.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut did he know about all those pieces?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course. But like the others, he thinks these pieces are really economic scams. Big scams. He became very angry. He said, \u2018This is not art. I tell you what this is, my friend. This is a scam. We know how much it costs to make Sunflower Seeds and you sell them for this much.\u2019 They said, \u2018How can Sunflower Seeds be art?\u2019 I said, \u2018It\u2019s art, or not art, I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t care. It\u2019s not the thing I care about the most. I care if I can provide a new condition, a new perspective, and from that angle, see something completely new.'\u201d\n\n\u201cCondition? For other people or for you?\u201d\n\n\u201cFor me and also for others. So that in the new condition people can look at the world differently and draw different conclusions. It\u2019s not practical or logical; it\u2019s not science or rational thought. It deals with our imagination, our fears, our dreams. We talked quite a lot on these things actually. First they don\u2019t understand: \u2018What other view? What condition? What new angle?\u2019 I tried to tell them that the classical view about art is very limited and it cannot really cope with today\u2019s life or today\u2019s understanding of ourselves or our universe. Very often it is beyond our aesthetic judgement. Then later on they start to understand a little bit. They really did. And they learnt. They want to know the nature of my work: why did you stick a finger at Tiananmen \u2013 it\u2019s not art, it\u2019s just a gesture of insult in the west, everybody knows this means \u2018Fuck off.\u2019 I said, \u2018The work is entitled \u2018A Study of Perspective\u2019 and in the old days in the west, in Renaissance times, perspective was suddenly very important.\u2019 So of course first they think I\u2019m just lying. But they are fast learners. They are very smart people. They are all very smart, intelligent people. It\u2019s only because their job limits them to a very limited position. So, I explained art to them and then many times they said to me, \u2018Weiwei, why whenever we talk about art and concepts do you get so excited that you keep talking? And why when we talk about facts, you say, \u2018I don\u2019t know\u2019?\u2019 But I say, \u2018You know, I like to talk about art, and it makes me joyful and when I get to talk about art and explain I get very high spirits.\u2019 But when I talk about which day, and how much money and all that, I really don\u2019t remember those things. It\u2019s not what I care about. And later they realise there are movements like Dada, or surrealism. It was incredible. One day they came back in to interrogate me some more and they were very happy, as if they had made a great breakthrough in the case: \u2018OK, we found out! You\u2019re part of Dada.\u2019 I said, \u2018Ahh, yes, you\u2019re a little closer.'\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Chinese dissident and artist discusses China, imprisonment and not being beaten", "title": "Ai Weiwei: My captors knew nothing about art", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The Chinese dissident and artist discusses China, imprisonment and not being beaten", "title": "Ai Weiwei: My captors knew nothing about art", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/09/28/ai_weiwei_my_captors_knew_nothing_about_art/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/09/weiwei_ai.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Chinese dissident and artist discusses China, imprisonment and not being beaten", "title": "Ai Weiwei: My captors knew nothing about art", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/09/weiwei_ai.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Barnaby Martin", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Ai Weiwei, Art, Asia, Books, China, Writers and Writing", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb58b\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Ai Weiwei, Art, Asia, Books, China, Writers and Writing, Entertainment News, NewsI carry the fresh tea back into the room.\nWe know how much it costs to make Sunflower Seeds and you sell them for this much.\u2019 They said, \u2018How can Sunflower Seeds be art?\u2019 I said, \u2018It\u2019s art, or not art, I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t care.\nBut you also don\u2019t know precisely what they mean.\nSo, I explained art to them and then many times they said to me, \u2018Weiwei, why whenever we talk about art and concepts do you get so excited that you keep talking?\nAfter peeing you report to the soldier, \u2018Sir, I have to wash my hands.\u2019 If you don\u2019t say anything they say, \u2018Report!\u2019 So you say, \u2018Report, sir, I have finished washing my hands."}
