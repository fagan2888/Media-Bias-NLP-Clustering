But all these folks were cheerleaders for the Affordable Care Act from day one.\n\nSarah Kliff, another ObamaCare supporter, estimates that health reform has enabled about 5 million people to become newly insured. But that\u2019s only about 10 percent of the uninsured. What happened to the mandate that required that everyone have health insurance this year or face a fine? Turns out that the mandate doesn\u2019t actually apply to millions of people. In fact, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that 90 percent of the uninsured are exempt from the mandate.\n\nCertain exemptions are written into the law itself. For example, the mandate doesn\u2019t apply to American Indians, to people who have religious objections or to people who earn too little to be required to file an income tax return. But as I wrote at Forbes the other day:\n\n\u2026 the administration has piled on with 14 ways people can avoid the fine based on hardships. These include homelessness, domestic violence, being evicted from a residence, having a utility cut off, property damage from a fire or flood, and even a canceled insurance plan. Also, people can avoid the penalty if a close family member has died recently or if they have medical expenses resulting in substantial debt.\n\nIt gets worse. Many of the people who signed up didn\u2019t pay their first premium. Of those who did, many have stopped paying. For example, Aetna is estimating that by the end of this year they will have lost about 30 percent of their initial enrollees. There is a report of similar attrition out of Florida, which has apparently lost one fourth of its initial enrollees already. The administration, which has access to national numbers, has refused to release any information on such \u201cbuyer\u2019s remorse\u201d since May.\n\nUnderlying all this is the fact that millions of newly insured people didn\u2019t understand what they were buying, even though their premiums are being heavily subsidized. As Lena Sun, writing in the Washington Post, reported:\n\nNonprofit organizations across the country are being swamped by consumers with questions. Many are low-income, have never had insurance and have little knowledge of the health-care system. The rampant confusion poses a potential hurdle for the success of the health law: If many Americans don\u2019t understand how health insurance works, that could hurt their ability to use their benefits \u2013 or to keep their coverage altogether.\n\nHealth insurance guru Robert Laszewski puts it this way:\n\nSo what you\u2019ve got is an insurance industry that did not do a good job in gearing up for a population that has never had health insurance before, an Obama administration that did a horrible job on the back end, resulting in a flood of calls to insurer call centers, and a population that is low-income and is not health-insurance literate. Put those things in a bag and you\u2019ve got a problem.\n\nSo if ObamaCare is failing miserably at insuring the uninsured, what difference does it make? Even though the health insurance mandate is affecting very few of the uninsured, it is having a major effect on people who are insured.\n\nUp to 80 percent of the people who had individual insurance last year will lose their coverage by the time all the ObamaCare rules completely set in. Up to 90% of the plans that cover people at work will lose their grandfathered status. In many of these cases, people are being forced to buy richer and more expensive plans \u2013 with more coverage than they want or need. In other cases, they may lose insurance altogether.\n\nEarly reports are that the trend of small business to dump their health plans and move employees onto the exchanges is occurring faster than was expected.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Yes according to Paul Krugman, Ezra Klein and the Commonwealth Fund.
