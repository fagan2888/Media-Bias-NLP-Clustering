De Blasio has come under intense criticism from police union officials for what they perceive as disparaging and dangerous treatment of law enforcement.\n\nThe New York Post summed up the overtly toxic relationship with this anecdote:\n\nAfter the funeral, about 100 police officers, firefighters and others who had stood vigil for \u00adRamos made their way to Teedee\u2019s Tavern, about two blocks from the church.\n\nA firefighter hopped up onto a table, a beer in one hand and a camera in the other, taking pictures of the packed bar.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s to Ramos! Here\u2019s to the NYPD!\u201d he shouted, to the cheers of those assembled.\n\n\u201cAnd f\u2013k de Blasio!\u201d he added, raising a raucous response from the crowd.\n\nStill, some public individuals have tried to look beyond the present contentiousness. The leader of a national organization for Latino police called on anti-de Blasio officers Sunday to \u201crise above the rhetoric and be more professional,\u201d Newsday reported, urging that the focus remain on honoring Ramos.\n\nAdditionally, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani offered his support to de Blasio \u201cwhen it comes to the safety of this city and our police officers,\u201d according to an anonymous politician quoted by the Post who witnessed an exchange between the two Saturday.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Officers outside the church where the funeral was being held turned their backs to a video monitor showing de Blasio's remarks, continuing a trend of law enforcement giving the beleaguered mayor the cold shoulder.", "title": "Bill de Blasio speaks to the backs of law enforcement at slain...", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://redalertpolitics.com/files/2014/12/NYC-Mayor\u2019s-First-Yea_Deat-600x400.jpg", "height": 400}, "url": "http://redalertpolitics.com/2014/12/29/bill-de-blasio-speaks-backs-law-enforcement-slain-cops-funeral/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "app_id": 529886110401651}, "msvalidate.01": "0F003B4674EABE0F24651B476B61A43C", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RedAlertPolitics", "tag": "rafael-ramos", "published_time": "2014-12-29T11:04:09+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-29T11:12:05+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd131a\"", "article_summary": "Bill de Blasio speaks to the backs of law enforcement at slain cop\u2019s funeralThis was the scene outdoors Saturday as New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio addressed a throng at the funeral of slain NYPD officer Rafael Ramos:Officers outside the church where the funeral was being held turned their backs to a video monitor showing de Blasio\u2019s remarks, continuing a trend of law enforcement giving the beleaguered mayor the cold shoulder.\nDe Blasio has come under intense criticism from police union officials for what they perceive as disparaging and dangerous treatment of law enforcement.\nThe leader of a national organization for Latino police called on anti-de Blasio officers Sunday to \u201crise above the rhetoric and be more professional,\u201d Newsday reported, urging that the focus remain on honoring Ramos.\n\u201cAnd f\u2013k de Blasio!\u201d he added, raising a raucous response from the crowd.\nA firefighter hopped up onto a table, a beer in one hand and a camera in the other, taking pictures of the packed bar."}
