Mike Enzi (R-Wyo.).\n\nThe question that appeared to strike a strong chord was on foreign policy -- specifically if the GOP was veering away from tactics long supported by her and her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney.\n\nTIME: The Republican Party is turning away from the brand of foreign policy that you and your father have long espoused. Is that a danger for the Republican Party?\n\nCheney: I think that yes, it is dangerous. I think isolationism is a mistake, no matter what party you see it in. We have to remember that there are two threats to our freedom: there\u2019s a threat that comes from the federal government, from the Obama Administration policies..but there\u2019s also a huge and significant threat from al-Qaeda. The war on terror is still underway. Al-Qaeda is stronger today than it\u2019s been in many years. We have to be able to protect our freedom from both of those threats.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Days before Liz Cheney sparred with her si...", "sailthru.expire_date": "2013-11-22 10:04:47 -0500", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "Days before Liz Cheney sparred with her si...", "title": "Liz Cheney Reveals What Is 'Dangerous' For The GOP", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/21/liz-cheney-republican-party_n_4316386.html", "image": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1475074/images/o-LIZ-CHENEY-facebook.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Days before Liz Cheney sparred with her si...", "creator": "cgentilviso", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1475074/images/o-LIZ-CHENEY-facebook.jpg", "height": 1000}, "title": "Liz Cheney Reveals What Is 'Dangerous' For The GOP", "site": "@HuffPostPol", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-11-21 10:04:47 -0500", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=4316386", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "video,liz cheney foreign policy,liz cheney republican party,Liz Cheney,liz cheney gop,gop,Joe Lieberman,Republican Party,Jon Kyl,foreign policy,liz-cheney", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "video,liz cheney foreign policy,liz cheney republican party,Liz Cheney,liz cheney gop,gop,Joe Lieberman,Republican Party,Jon Kyl,foreign policy,liz-cheney", "published_time": "2013-11-21 10:04:47 -0500", "modified_time": "2013-11-21 15:11:45 -0500"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd12e\"", "article_summary": "TIME: The Republican Party is turning away from the brand of foreign policy that you and your father have long espoused.\nDays before Liz Cheney sparred with her sister over gay marriage, the Wyoming Senate candidate lamented a separate issue that could be \"dangerous\" for the Republican Party.\nIs that a danger for the Republican Party?\nI think isolationism is a mistake, no matter what party you see it in.\nWe have to be able to protect our freedom from both of those threats."}
