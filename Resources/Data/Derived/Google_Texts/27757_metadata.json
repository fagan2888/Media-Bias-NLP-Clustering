To Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, it can even be transformative.\n\n\u201cBirth control has been nothing short of revolutionary for women and society, yet we are still fighting to ensure that every woman in America has full access to the birth control method of her choosing \u2014 without barriers based on cost, availability, or stigma,\u201d Richards said as she introduced the latest report from the Planned Parenthood Action Fund (PPact). \u201cAs the nation\u2019s leading women\u2019s health care provider and advocate, Planned Parenthood knows the transformative effect birth control has on women\u2019s lives \u2014 we see it every day in our patients and supporters\u2026birth control dramatically improves the lives and conditions of women and families, as well as the U.S. economy at large.\"\n\n\"I Jennifer Graylock-Graylock.com\n\nThe report goes on to outline how birth control has made it so women can finish school and pursue their careers; the teen pregnancy rate is the lowest it\u2019s been in 40 years; and the Affordable Care Act \u201ceases the disproportionate health care burdens on women,\u201d while \u201cincreasing access to reproductive health care.\u201d And in case people are hesitant to take Planned Parenthood\u2019s word for it, they\u2019ve launched a related campaign that invites women to share how birth control has personally helped them.\n\nVolunteer dresses up as birth control pills.

One woman named Brittany said, \u201cBirth control has helped me be successful as a United States Peace Corps Volunteer, as it allowed me to serve without the complication of an unwanted pregnancy; it had also helped me to complete grad school, as my focus can be directed to my studies and clinical work rather than raising a child.\u201d Another woman named Shanti said birth control helped her reduce painful cramps, as well as empower her to wait until she\u2019s ready to have children.\n\nWith this increased transparency, Planned Parenthood hopes birth control access increases across the country, as well as improves sex education, clinical research, public policy advocacy and litigation, and new innovations in online health services and mobile apps.\n\n\u201cBirth control is transformative, essential, and irreplaceable. Empowering people to illuminate this through their own stories is one very important part of keeping this country moving ever forward \u2014 never backward \u2014 on birth control,\u201d said Eric Ferrero, vice president of communications at Planned Parenthood Federation of America. \u201cWe urge everyone to join this important conversation \u2014 right now, today.
