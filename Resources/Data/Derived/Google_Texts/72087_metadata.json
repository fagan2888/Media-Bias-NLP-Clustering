(CBSNewYork) \u2014 Many people are still scrambling to change their health insurance after a major insurer, Health Republic, went belly up.\n\nMany have switched to the new basic essentials plan being offered through the New York state health exchange, but the failure of Health Republic is having some major consequences for the medical providers, too.\n\nKevin Dahill, president and CEO of the Nassau-Suffolk Hospital Council, said his group is trying to make sure doctors and hospitals are not stiffed on at least $100 million owed to them by Health Republic.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of outstanding claims at the hospitals,\u201d Dahill told TV 10/55\u2019s Richard Rose on Sunday\u2019s \u201cExit 10/55.\u201d\n\nDahill said around mid-summer payments from Health Republic stopped coming in. The state announced in early September it wanted the company to cease operations, which took effect Nov. 30 and impacted about 200,000 people.\n\nThe move put both patients and providers in a bind.\n\n\u201cA number of these people are sick and undergoing treatment. Many of them are pregnant. So there was no way their treatment could be ceased,\u201d Dahill said. \u201cSo the hospitals and the doctors had to continue to take care of them, but at that point were on notice that there was no insurance coverage.\u201d\n\nDahill said Health Republic was different because it was a federal co-op plan formed as a result of the Affordable Care Act. He said 23 such co-ops were created nationwide and 14 have failed.\n\n\u201cPolitics \u2026 took over in this case,\u201d Dahill said. \u201cWhat happened was these federal co-ops were funded upfront by the federal government. They were given reassurances that as their enrollment grew, as utilization grew, there would be a further infusion of money. And that never happened. And it didn\u2019t happen because of the politics in Washington.\u201d\n\nHealth Republic told Newsday its financial problems were \u201ccreated largely by the risk corridor program only paying out 12.6 percent of the $149 million Health Republic was owed for 2014.\u201d\n\nDahill said his group is making sure people are still receiving treatment. Some are being automatically enrolled in the essentials plan, but many are complaining they can\u2019t see their regular doctors under that plan.\n\nThe Health Republic failure means many people will have to pay higher premiums or seek subsidies to help with the cost.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Many people are still scrambling to change their health insurance after a major insurer, Health Republic, went belly up.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2015/12/13/health-republic-failure/", "image": {"width": 625, "secure_url": "https://cbsnewyork.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/health-insurance-copy.jpg?w=625", "identifier": "https://cbsnewyork.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/health-insurance-copy.jpg?w=625", "height": 352}, "type": "article", "description": "Many people are still scrambling to change their health insurance after a major insurer, Health Republic, went belly up.", "title": "Health Republic Failure Creates Burden For Both NY Patients, Medical Providers"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://cbsnewyork.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/health-insurance-copy.jpg?w=625", "title": "Health Republic Failure Creates Burden For Both NY Patients, Medical Providers", "site": "/CBSnewyork", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Many people are still scrambling to change their health insurance after a major insurer, Health Republic, went belly up."}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Breaking News, Sports, Weather, Traffic And The Best of NY", "fb": {"app_id": 148100721870411}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "bitly-verification": "98ab9c1eda26", "application-name": "CBS New York", "google-site-verification": "44caXBf4kjHeKKAT7ZZ89NaCX25utL_yRSa-qGpwIhY", "keywords": "health republic failure, new york state health exchange", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/CBSNewYork", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/CBSNewYork"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://newyork.cbslocal.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/50e3ae7b1a37ec6f5f022661f15b5473?s=16", "news_keywords": "affordable care act, health republic, kevin dahill, nassau-suffolk hospital council, new york state of health, obamacare, richard rose"}, "article_summary": "HAUPPAUGE, N.Y.
