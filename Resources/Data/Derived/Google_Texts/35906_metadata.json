We are experiencing a surge in demand and are making sure that we will be ready to help consumers who may be in line by the deadline to complete enrollment -- either online or over the phone,\" said Joanne Peters, a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nAdministration officials said this move, similar to the one in December for the large number of people who were trying to sign up by January 1, will accommodate people who face special circumstances or complex cases and need extra time to complete their enrollment.\n\nThe officials said those who fall in this category will have to attest to their circumstances as part of the application process. They refused to say how much more time these people will get to finish enrollment and still qualify for coverage this year.\n\nJUST WATCHED Obamacare's 2 Big Days Replay More Videos ...

Specific details could be released as early as Wednesday.\n\nCNN last week reported the administration was considering this action. In an answer to a question from CNN Senior White House Correspondent Jim Acosta on Friday, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney indicated the administration would allow some flexibility for those who encountered problems meeting Monday's deadline.\n\n\"As was the case for the December deadline, we're going to want to make sure that people who are already in line can finish their enrollment,\" Carney said.\n\nInsurance industry sources did not want to comment in detail until they knew of the specifics but said anytime changes are made, it complicates their work and will require manual workarounds to help complete applications. They said so long as the time period is limited, they can accept it.\n\nRepublicans Tuesday evening criticized the move by the administration.\n\n\"Another day, another Obamacare delay from the same Obama administration that won't work with Republicans to help Americans suffering from the unintended consequences of the Democrats' failed health care law,\" Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said in a statement.\n\nThe White House is trying to meet a goal of enrolling 6 million people. As of mid-March, 5 million had enrolled. The administration has been engaged in an exhaustive effort to not only enroll as many people as possible but also to increase the percentage of young adults who apply to help balance the makeup of those insured.\n\nThe administration said it has recently seen a major increase in traffic to HeatlhCare.gov.
