Michele Bachmann.\n\nBut since Drudge slammed Fallon in February for allegedly favoring Democrats, the late night host has scorched President Barack Obama on a number of occasions. He has, for instance, mocked Obama\u2019s supposed Obamacare sign-up triumph, dinged the president for appearing weak during the Ukraine crisis and even brought Sarah Palin on the show to ridicule Obama. (SEE: Palin Joins Obama To Mock Obama\u2019s Weakness)\n\nHillary Clinton, too, has been the target of Fallon\u2019s sharp barbs. (WATCH: Jimmy Fallon Mocks Hillary Clinton For Dressing Like A Man)\n\nSo did Drudge\u2019s criticism play a part in catalyzing Fallon\u2019s comic assault on the left? Comedian Adam Carolla says it\u2019s quite possible.\n\n\u201cYea, you know, I think those guys go and sample their news and potential stories from a multitude of sources and, you know, if they hear a criticism like that, if somebody points it out to them, they may overcompensate and do something of that nature,\u201d Carolla said in an extensive interview with The Daily Caller about politics, Hollywood and his new book, \u201cPresident Me: The America That\u2019s in My Head.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell you because I don\u2019t know if Jimmy Fallon is looking at the Drudge Report now and acting accordingly,\u201d he sarcastically added. (SEE: Jimmy Kimmel Shows, Laughs At Drudge Report Headline)\n\nBut Carolla is close with Jimmy Kimmel, ABC\u2019s late night show host. From what he knows of Kimmel, do late night show hosts worry about alienating conservatives by going hard on Republicans while going soft on Democrats?\n\n\u201cI think these guys try to go, you know, \u2018look, whoever the president is, whether he be Republican or Democrat, we need to make jokes about the president,'\u201d Carolla said. \u201cExcept for you probably do find that when it\u2019s a Republican there are a few more jokes than when a Democrat is in office.\u201d\n\nCarolla went on to say that late night show hosts can\u2019t really espouse conservative views because doing so would alienate Hollywood\u2019s liberal glitterati.\n\n\u201cYou got to understand, too, Fallon wants Bruce Springsteen to come on his show and sing a medley of songs with him, right?\u201d Carolla said. \u201cSo if Fallon took a stance like, \u2018turns out Fallon\u2019s anti-gay marriage,\u2019 well if Fallon is anti-gay marriage, then Bruce does not come on Fallon\u2019s show, you understand? And neither does Meryl Streep, and neither does anybody.\u201d (READ: Adam Carolla Explains What It Is Like To Be A Conservative In Hollywood)\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying Fallon is anti-gay marriage,\u201d Carolla continued. \u201cBut I\u2019m saying if Fallon took a stance against gay marriage or abortion or whatever the agenda is \u2014 if he took a stance against any of that, his bookings would dry up. So he has to worry about his bookings, so thus he has to worry about his politics.\u201d\n\nAsked whether Kimmel is the most sympathetic late night show host to conservatives considering Kimmel is friends with both Ben Stein and him, Carolla conceded he very well could be. (READ: Is Jimmy Kimmel Now The Safest Couch for Conservatives On Late Night Television?)\n\n\u201cAs far as late night goes, I guess Jimmy might be the most conservative,\u201d Carolla said, laughing, before stipulating that he really doesn\u2019t know the politics of Fallon or Letterman all that well.\n\nYou\u2019ll find previous segments from TheDC\u2019s interview with Carolla below:\n\nWhy Adam Carolla Is Anti-Obamacare But Pro-Death Panels\n\nAdam Carolla\u2019s Hilarious Explanation Why Fountains Symbolize American Greatness\n\nAdam Carolla Stands By Claim That Gay Mafia Stifles Speech in Hollywood\n\nAdam Carolla On How To Fix America In One Second\n\nAdam Carolla: Deadbeat Dads Worse Than Charles Manson\n\nAdam Carolla On Why He Thinks Rich People Are \u2018Better Than Poor People\u2019\n\nAdam Carolla Explains Why He Supports Tucker Carlson For President In 2016\n\nFollow Jamie on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Jamie Weinstein", "description": "Did Matt Drudge force Jimmy Fallon to become more of an equal opportunity offender politically?", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Did Matt Drudge embarrass Jimmy Fallon into becoming more of an equal opportunity offender politically?
