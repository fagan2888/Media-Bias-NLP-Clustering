Except in one game, of course. But they don\u2019t.\n\nHaving both programs doing well is good for college football in the state, and thus good for both. When an elite, deservedly much-coveted Colorado prep prospect knows he can pick between two winning programs in a state increasingly paying attention to the college game, that\u2019s progress. For both.\n\nThat cuts back against both history and recent trends.\n\nFor CSU fans, who of any age tend to be more deep-rooted and loyal, the rivalry more genuinely has the feel of dating back to the schools being in the same league. Many of them know the words to \u201cFum\u2019s Song\u201d \u2014 memo to the new CSU athletic administration: Bring it back \u2014 and most of all resent the mystifying and unjustified condescension coming from Boulder.\n\nBut \u2026 really \u2026 the Buffs doing well would be good for the Rams.\n\nFor CU fans, the denigration of CSU\u2019s success in the Mountain West, outside the \u201cpower five\u201d conferences, is both silly and tiresome. Some CU fans will argue that they do root for CSU, but the pat-on-the-head condescension that comes with it ruins the effect. It\u2019s especially absurd in a year when that \u201clittle brother\u201d program that goes on to do well in league play can counter with \u201cScoreboard.\u201d Last Aug. 29, it was right there on the big screens at Sports Authority Field at Mile High: CSU 31, CU 17.\n\nIn a year when no CU players were drafted, the Broncos tentatively are planning to start a rookie from CSU at left tackle, and one of the subplots is that Ty Sambrailo\u2019s father is a former CU track athlete.\n\nThe NCAA last year approved \u201cautonomy\u201d for the power five conferences, and that led to the institution this year of cost-of-attendance stipends for scholarship athletes in those leagues, including at CU. It would have changed the dynamic of the rivalry and comparisons if CSU and the Mountain West had failed to follow the \u201cpower five\u201d lead. But they did. The widening of the gap between the power five and the nonpower conferences might be in- evitable, but at least with matching stipends, the best teams in the Mountain West will continue to have a chance to beat power-five teams on the field.\n\nIncluding in Denver.\n\nOn the field, the future of the rivalry is iffy at best beyond the final meeting in the current contract, CSU\u2019s home game against the Buffaloes in the new on-campus stadium in 2020.\n\nCU\u2019s recent announcement of a 2020 and 2022 home-and-home series against Air Force added to the intrigue. That pivots on adding a CU home game in 2020, when the Buffs already are playing in Fort Collins, so it doesn\u2019t necessarily involve rejecting the concept of playing CSU in the future, but it still at least raises eyebrows.\n\nWhat also seems farcical at times is the debate over future scheduling tied to games played by athletes now in seventh grade and involving coaching staffs and athletic department administrations that \u2014 at least through coldly projecting the historical trends \u2014 either might not or probably won\u2019t be in the same positions by then.\n\nRegardless, for selfish reasons, the two programs should be rooting for each other.\n\nTerry Frei: tfrei@ denverpost.com or twitter.com/ TFrei", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Frei: CU, CSU football programs and their fans should be rooting for each other", "title": "Frei: CU, CSU football programs and their fans should be rooting for each other", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/07/26/frei-cu-csu-football-programs-and-their-fans-should-be-rooting-for-each-other/", "image": {"width": 512, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg", "height": 512}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-26T22:05:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-23T02:45:23+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Colorado State University, Terry Frei, University of Colorado"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2782\"", "article_summary": "Some CU fans will argue that they do root for CSU, but the pat-on-the-head condescension that comes with it ruins the effect.\nFor CU fans, the denigration of CSU\u2019s success in the Mountain West, outside the \u201cpower five\u201d conferences, is both silly and tiresome.\nFor CSU fans, who of any age tend to be more deep-rooted and loyal, the rivalry more genuinely has the feel of dating back to the schools being in the same league.\nIn all my years in Colorado, in the wake of graduating from the school in Boulder and covering both programs, this is the part I \u201cget\u201d but don\u2019t understand: Especially because the state schools are in different leagues, CU fans enthusiastically should be rooting for CSU, and CSU fans enthusiastically should be rooting for CU.\nIt would have changed the dynamic of the rivalry and comparisons if CSU and the Mountain West had failed to follow the \u201cpower five\u201d lead."}
