It\u2019s the corruption of words that begins the corruption of ideas. That is terrifying.\u201d\n\nSee more of Entertainment\u2019s top stories on Facebook >>\n\n\u201cUnderground\u201d follows the journey of a group of American slaves who plan an escape from a Georgia plantation and are helped by a secretly abolitionist couple running a station on the Underground Railroad.\n\nGoldsman, picking up on the idea that modern comparisons to slavery may be overwrought, said the Underground Railroad period has \u201csomehow become obscured by shadow. It\u2019s not taught, we don\u2019t learn it \u2026 it\u2019s the vanishing of our past, and therefore the whole wonderful notion we are doomed to repeat it becomes ever more likely.\u201d\n\nThe 10-episode first season will premiere commercial-free on March 9.
