He casually sipped a Corona beer while she drank from a can of Jim Beam and Coke.\n\nMs Hadley looked stunning in black slacks and a cream blouse that accentuated her toned physique, while Parish beamed in a suit as he hid his beer bottle under his jacket thrown over his arm.\n\nParish was angry when he realised it wasn\u2019t the wedding photographer who had photographed them together.\n\nDistressed about the breakdown of her 20-year marriage with the 2GB presenter, American-born Ms Hadley has started building a life for herself.\n\nA few weeks ago she moved her two teenage daughters out of the luxury Dural homestead she and the influential radio commentator shared. It is believed she has since moved into a unit not far from Dural to make it easier for the couple to share time with their two teenage daughters.\n\nMr Hadley has moved back into the Dural home.\n\nDON\u2019T MEDDLE WITH ME: HADLEY FIGHTS BACK ON AIR\n\nHADLEY AND DALEY CALL TRUCE OVER STORM\n\nThe Hadley marriage broke down after a much-publicised heated row in February, which resulted in Ms Hadley filing an Apprehended Violence Order against Mr Hadley and his police officer son Daniel. Ms Hadley later withdrew the application.\n\nThe new couple\u2019s appearance together at the wedding yesterday surprised many, coming as it did just two days after The Daily Telegraph revealed Hadley had contacted NSW Origin officials asking for Parish to be more discreet with their relationship.\n\nMr Hadley said this week he wanted to protect his daughters.\n\n\u201cShe is not planning on taking a backwards step, despite what Ray does and says,\u201d one close friend said.\n\nAnother friend said Ms Hadley was enjoying a new love. Concerned for her daughters, Ms Hadley has refused to speak about the break-up but has, friends say, been under \u201cextreme pressure\u201d and shaken by what they describe as false claims that she and Parish started dating before her marriage ended.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been an unbelievably difficult time for her and her family,\u201d one supporter said.\n\n\u201cHer marriage ended, she did the courageous thing and moved out of the relationship, but because her estranged husband has a popular radio show, she feels she has an obligation to protect him, even though someone is clearly hell-bent on smearing her good name.\u201d\n\nIt was during a night out with girlfriends at Terrigal\u2019s Crown Plaza Hotel in March that the newly single Mrs Hadley met divorcee Parish.", "article_metadata": {"description": "SUZANNE  Hadley and new love Matt Parish  capped off a week of personal turmoil by attending a friend&#8217;s wedding yesterday.", "generator": "legacy", "og": {"site_name": "DailyTelegraph", "description": "SUZANNE  Hadley and new love Matt Parish  capped off a week of personal turmoil by attending a friend&#8217;s wedding yesterday.", "title": "Her new love: Suzanne\u2019s cosy walk with Matt Parish", "url": "http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/her-new-love-suzannes-cosy-walk-with-matt-parish/story-fni0cx4q-1226921340076", "image": "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/external?url=http://content4.video.news.com.au/foxsports/prod/archive/2014/05/17/FSD_170514_NRL_SOUTH_BURGESS_FOLO_VSV.jpg&width=650&api_key=kq7wnrk4eun47vz9c5xuj3mc", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": {"identifier": "@dailytelegraph", "id": "@dailytelegraph"}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "fb": {"admins": ",100000875899514", "app_id": 135086289853833}, "articleid": 1226921340076, "keywords": "rugby league commentator, popular radio show, vacant beach house, police officer son, estranged husband, courageous thing, heated row, teenage daughters, family home, subs sat, extreme pressure, beer bottle, Fairfax press, John Singleton, David Stanley Smith, Matt Parish, Suzanne Hadley, Carolyn Denton, Yvette Hartman, estranged wife, team assistant, team assistant coach, police officer, close friend, personal turmoil, rugby league, influential radio commentator, public defiance, cream blouse, spending weekends, toned physique, Dragons v Roosters, property.The couple, strolled arm, DAY clash, ,Central Coast,Tasmania,Australia, ,Terrigal,New South Wales,Australia, Jim Beam, Daily Telegraph", "article": {"publisher": "News Limited", "publicationdate": "Sun May 18 14:06:05 EST 2014", "modified_time": "Sun May 18 14:06:05 EST 2014", "author": "Annette Sharp and Amy Harris Sydney Confidential"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2931\"", "article_summary": "Another friend said Ms Hadley was enjoying a new love.\nDistressed about the breakdown of her 20-year marriage with the 2GB presenter, American-born Ms Hadley has started building a life for herself.\nMs Hadley later withdrew the application.\nThe two women became friends after Ms Denton\u2019s ex-husband Dave was hired to build the Hadleys\u2019 sprawling Dural home.\nParish was angry when he realised it wasn\u2019t the wedding photographer who had photographed them together."}
