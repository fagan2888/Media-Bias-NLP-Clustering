Add an aging population and expanded government insurance to the equation and selective healthcare stocks make solid long-term bets.\n\nA particularly appealing health sector play now is UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH), a healthcare powerhouse that reported strong results for the fourth quarter and full year 2014 before markets opened today.\n\nCurrently the market leader in the United States, UnitedHealth Group offers health benefit plans for individuals and public and private employers of all sizes. Among the company\u2019s diversified portfolio of health insurance and delivery products are pharmacy benefit management, benefit plan design and claims processing services.\n\nUNH today reported reported fourth quarter earnings per share (EPS) of $1.55 on revenue of $33.4 billion, compared to EPS of $1.41 during the same period a year ago. Wall Street had expected EPS of $1.50 on revenue of $33.1 billion. The company\u2019s premium revenue in the quarter jumped 6% year-over-year to $29.3 billion.\n\nSignificantly, UNH\u2019s cost containment measures appear to be bearing fruit through an improving \u201cmedical care ratio,\u201d the money it spends to process and pay medical claims compared to the insurance premiums it generates. The ratio in the fourth quarter dropped to 79.8%, compared to 81.2% in the same quarter a year ago.\n\nFor the full year, UnitedHealth Group reported EPS of $5.70 on revenue of $130.4 billion, compared with EPS of $5.50 and revenue of $122.5 billion in 2013. The analysts\u2019 consensus had called for EPS of $5.64 and revenue of $130.1 billion. Cash flows from operations in 2014 reached $8 billion, a year-over-year increase of 15%.\n\nFor 2015, management provided guidance of between $140.5 billion and $141.5 billion in revenue and between $6 and $6.25 in EPS.\n\nUNH\u2019s year-over-year EPS increase of 3.6% in 2014 was mostly driven by gains in Medicare and Medicaid enrollment. Combined enrollment of all types of clients dipped from 45.4 million in 2013 to 44.9 million in 2014. However, Medicare and Medicaid enrollment rose from a combined total of 10.4 million in 2013 to 11.8 million in 2014, a strong year-over-year jump of 13%.\n\nUNH Stock: Profits From the Poor\n\nIt\u2019s in the field of Medicaid that UNH faces its greatest growth opportunities. One of the major changes under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, is that millions of lower-income Americans without health insurance will qualify for Medicaid, the federal-state partnership that pays healthcare bills for the nation\u2019s neediest families.\n\nAccording to figures this year from the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, by 2016 an estimated 11 million to 16 million Americans will be newly insured through Medicaid, whose coverage will be fully paid by the federal government. States now pay about half; Obamacare offers financial assistance for states to expand coverage.\n\nThe latest tally shows that 27 states and the District of Columbia have expanded Medicaid coverage; 24 states with conservative governors have vehemently refused to expand Medicaid coverage for ideological reasons.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear, though, how long voters will allow state lawmakers to leave federal money on the table, especially as the economy improves and consumers feel more confident.\n\nMedicaid expansion officially started in January 2014, funneling millions of new customers into the open arms of Medicaid HMOs. UnitedHealth Group dominates the Medicaid HMO business and should see its coffers swell in 2015 not just from an influx of subsidized poor people but also middle income Americans choosing its individual plans through the various state run health insurance exchanges that were set up under Obamacare.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Obamacare imposes stiff fines on individuals without health insurance, in an effort to increase the insurance risk pool.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe federal government is a multi-trillion-dollar juggernaut and when it starts to infuse an investment sector with money, the pie gets bigger for companies looking to profit. Few sectors are bigger and more pervasive these days than healthcare.\n\nUnitedHealth Group is well-positioned to profit from the landscape as shaped by Obamacare, an aging population that will need more care, and the ranks of uninsured Americans who will now get coverage for the first time in their lives.\n\nWith a strong balance sheet, an entrenched presence in the Medicaid business and optimistic guidance for 2015, UNH should weather the market turmoil that\u2019s likely to unfold this year, especially in the energy markets.\n\nMeanwhile, Obamacare\u2019s enrollment numbers are increasing and the GOP\u2019s chances of repealing the sweeping law are increasingly remote. UNH stock is a blue chip bet on the growing imperative to stay in the pink.\n\nAs of this writing, John Persinos did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace", "article_metadata": {"description": "As Obamacare expands enrollment for millions of Americans, UNH stock is in a strong position to outperform in 2015 and beyond.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "InvestorPlace", "description": "UnitedHealth Group is a dominant health insurer and a huge beneficiary of long-term trends in the healthcare sector.
