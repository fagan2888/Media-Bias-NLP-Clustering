The progression of a genetic disease called Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, which slowly breaks down connective tissues in Barton\u2019s skin, joints and blood vessels, means the freelance photographer can only work a few hours a month.\n\n\n\nPrior to this year, Barton couldn\u2019t afford medical insurance as an adult because her ailments stamped her with a pre-existing condition. But President Barack Obama\u2019s health care overhaul meant Barton would qualify for coverage after signing up for Medi-Cal, the state\u2019s low- income health care program. Then she could find a primary care physician.\n\n\n\nBut those plans have been on hold for Barton and hundreds of thousands of poor residents of California, where the enrollment backlog for Medi-Cal has resulted in diminished or delayed health care for some of the most needy. The waiting list for those who became newly eligible for the free coverage on Jan. 1 is now at about 600,000 people statewide, including at least 12,500 residents of Sonoma County.\n\n\n\nThe wait has forced people to postpone care, pay out of pocket for medical costs or sacrifice other living essentials, including food and housing.\n\n\n\nBarton, 30, of Petaluma said she is barely hanging on.\n\n\n\n\u201cMedi-Cal was my saving grace,\u201d she said. \u201cI applied in Sonoma County before Christmas, because I kept getting sicker and sicker. I called and kept calling. Then March came. Then April came. I\u2019m still waiting. Now it looks like I\u2019ll have to start all over.\u201d\n\n\n\nEight months after California opened up its low-income health program to millions of poor people, data gathered this summer show that in Sonoma County, more than half of newly eligible county residents who have applied for Medi-Cal benefits since Jan. 1 are still waiting for coverage.\n\n\n\nApplications for roughly 12,565 of the county\u2019s 18,000 previously uninsured people, many of whom are teetering on the brink of poverty, are stuck in the backlog.\n\n\n\nState and county health officials blame the delay on technology glitches, combined with a record number of Californians seeking Medi-Cal. State officials have set a goal to deal with those glitches and reduce the backlog nearly in half by September. Officials with the state Department of Health Care Services deferred to a July 14 letter that summarized that response and offered few additional details about the problem and the state\u2019s strategy to address it.\n\n\n\nThe state has not released data showing the county- by-county breakdown of the backlog. Officials said they were still reviewing the data for any violations of patient privacy.\n\n\n\nThe county\u2019s Human Services Department has brought on 39 new eligibility caseworkers since the Affordable Care Act went fully into effect, and in May deployed what it called its \u201cpower team\u201d \u2013 a group of 16 specialists whose sole job is to work the backlog.\n\n\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re doing the best we can, given the circumstances, with the tools we have,\u201d said Kim Seamens, division director with the Human Services Department, who oversees Medi- Cal determinations in Sonoma County. \u201cWe\u2019re making really good progress, and it\u2019s moving along much more smoothly than it was a few months ago.\u201d\n\n\n\nUnder the Medi-Cal expansion \u2014 a major part of the Affordable Care Act \u2014 people without kids and the uninsured poor became eligible for coverage, many for the first time in their lives. A family of four that earns $32,000 a year can now apply, or a single person making $16,000 annually. Here, county health officials braced for the influx.\n\n\n\nThe county\u2019s Human Services Department has received 12,792 Medi-Cal applications since the beginning of the year. More than half of those applications are still pending. As of June 30, 6,981 applications have not been processed. Each application represents an average of 1.8 people, according to the county.\n\n\n\nBarton became stuck in the backlog when, with the help of a family friend, she applied for Medi-Cal through the Covered California website. Her application went through four different computer systems before ending up in the hands of one of Sonoma County\u2019s 198 eligibility workers.\n\n\n\nBut her application was missing material. First, she was notified she had to send in a copy of her driver\u2019s license. Then it was copies of her tax return. Barton estimates she\u2019s racked up at least $25,000 in out-of-pocket medical costs while waiting for coverage. She could afford such expenses when she was working as a commercial photographer, shooting for companies such as Williams Sonoma and Pier 1 Imports. But her debilitating disease has curtailed most of that work.\n\n\n\n\u201cI need Medi-Cal,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the process of applying has been so awful.\u201d\n\n\n\nCalifornia is not alone in its enrollment problems. Five other states, including Alaska, Kansas, Michigan, Missouri and Tennessee, have been singled out for delays linked to the expansion of Medicaid, the federal low- income health program. Twenty states are not participating in the expansion.\n\n\n\nFederal health regulators are now clamping down on California. In July, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, a federal agency, demanded the state develop a plan to eradicate the backlog.\n\n\n\nHealth care advocates have railed against the problem.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unacceptable,\u201d said Sonoma County Supervisor Shirlee Zane, who heaped blame on the state. \u201cWe\u2019ve done our part to get people enrolled. We\u2019ve hired new people, we\u2019ve trained eligibility workers. Our problem has been the state \u2014 unlike Sonoma County, they were not prepared.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe criticism has been echoed by local officials statewide, prompting a lobbying push in Sacramento for a more streamlined application process.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve spoken to many counties who are frustrated by the big volume of applications they\u2019ve received, and various technology issues,\u201d said Elizabeth Landsberg with the Western Center for Law and Poverty, a health advocacy organization. \u201cPeople are worried and they are confused.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe July 14 letter from the state Department of Health Care Services, which regulates the low-income health program and processes Medi-Cal cards, outlined three key factors that have contributed to the backlog: A lot of applications submitted at once, technology upgrades that didn\u2019t work and duplicate applications.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe demand for Medi-Cal coverage was a lot greater than people ever expected,\u201d said Dylan Roby, an analyst at the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research, which produces simulation models to project Medi-Cal\u2019s growth. \u201cI think that demand overloaded the system because so many people were coming in at one time.\u201d\n\n\n\nBy the end of June, California had signed up 2.2 million newly eligible people for Medi-Cal, bringing the total enrollment to 10.9 million.\n\n\n\nBut problems continue. While counties in California continue to sift through the pile of 600,000 pending applications, eligibility workers are also certifying millions of Medi-Cal renewals \u2014 a process that every applicant must undergo annually. The state checks for changes in family size and income.\n\n\n\nThose applicants are being affected by the delay as well.\n\n\n\n\u201cMy concern is that people, especially those who need health care immediately, are having to delay health care or pay out of pocket,\u201d Roby said. \u201cSome people may have signed up back in October, and their system still hasn\u2019t been processed.\u201d\n\n\n\nSeamens said the county has the ability to fast-track people\u2019s applications if there is an immediate health need. But caseworkers must paper-process applications with missing fields, or when there are mistakes in applications, further delaying the process.\n\n\n\nThe backlog is further exacerbated because eligibility workers process applications through various entry points \u2014 online, through the mail, over the phone or in-person.\n\n\n\nThe county has chipped away at its own backlog, which hovered around 9,000 applications in May.\n\n\n\nCounty officials said given the complexity of the computer systems, along with significant user errors, some problems were expected. Thousands of applications remain pending because applicants left fields missing, for example, or filled in income information incorrectly, officials said. County eligibility workers send letters or call the applicants to gather missing data.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn the grand scheme of things,\u201d Seamens said, \u201cI think this will just be kind of a bad memory.\u201d\n\n\n\nPedro Toledo, the chief administrative officer at Petaluma Health Center, understands the reasons given by government officials for the delay, but patients are suffering, he said.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s affecting a lot of our people, especially those who have a chronic disease like diabetes,\u201d Toledo said. \u201cPeople want access. A lot of people are having to make choices of whether to buy medications, or buy groceries. It\u2019s also peace of mind; people will no longer have to worry about what happens if they have a catastrophic event.\u201d\n\n\n\nThree-quarters of the patients at Petaluma Health Center \u2014 7,300 people \u2014 are Medi-Cal patients. Barton, who visited the clinic on Wednesday, is hoping to become one of them. Enrollment workers and insurance experts were there to speed her application.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve gone through every range of emotion \u2014 first feeling sad, but now empowered,\u201d Barton said. \u201cBut I have to think, if I had Medi-Cal, I wouldn\u2019t have to go through all this.\u201d\n\n\n\nYou can reach Staff Writer Angela Hart at 526-8503 or angela.hart@pressdemocrat.com.
