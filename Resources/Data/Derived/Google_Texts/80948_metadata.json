We say \u201capparently\u201d because the legal opinion is being kept confidential.\n\nThis didn\u2019t sit well with Councilman Joe Gatto. The city attorney, Jeff Lester, pointed out that legal advice given to a council member is not something that is made public \u2014 at least not by the city\u2019s legal staff. \u201cIt\u2019s a confidential opinion, as we discussed earlier,\u201d Lester told Gatto. \u201cIt will not be made public.\u201d\n\nBut attorney-client privilege belongs to the client, not to the attorney, which means the client \u2014 in this case, the council \u2014 could choose to make the opinion public. At the meeting, Gatto asked Hensley if she would be willing to share the legal opinion with others.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Hensley replied, \u201cI don\u2019t have to.\u201d\n\nIf that comment didn\u2019t raise a red flag for citizens, the other comments Hensley made at the meeting probably did.\n\n\u201cI have to tell you,\u201d she said, \u201cin my 22 years on the Des Moines City Council, I have never seen such a difficult issue that has been before this council \u2014 and the doings that go on behind the scenes to really cause one or the other of us not to participate in the discussion. I\u2019m not proud of it, and I think it\u2019s very unfortunate. I\u2019m sorry to say I wish I could share more with you as to what has gone on, but I am going to take the high road. I\u2019m not going to recuse myself, and I\u2019m going to vote to support this.\u201d\n\nAfter Henley spoke, the mayor and council voted 4-3 to extend the tax abatement program. The vote came less than two months after the council voted down a different, but similar, request from Hensley, which followed a year of discussion and a dozen public meetings on the issue.\n\nAs Hensley indicated, she has been on the council for almost a quarter century, and during that time she has no doubt witnessed all sorts of unsavory political machinations. And yet the \u201cbehind the scenes\u201d maneuvering on this particular issue trumps all of that and, like the city\u2019s legal opinion, is not going to be shared with the public. That's a problem.\n\nSo is the fact that Hensley and fellow council member Bob Mahaffey have been using private email accounts to conduct official city business. For years, the city\u2019s website has included email links for all council members. In Hensley\u2019s case, one of the links has routed people to her personal Gmail account. After The Des Moines Register asked the city for Hensley\u2019s recent emails on the tax-abatement issue, pointing out that some would likely be on her personal computer, Lester said the newspaper would have to pay $194 for access.\n\nAsked how the city would retrieve the emails from Hensley\u2019s Gmail account, Lester said Hensley herself had already searched for, and turned over, the records she feels are relevant. Copies of just those emails would cost the newspaper $48, he said.\n\nWhatever the merits of the tax abatement, it seems clear that Hensley should have recused herself from the vote. The city\u2019s double-secret legal opinion speaks only to the requirements of the law, not to good public policy.\n\nAfter all her years on the council, Hensley should know that the appearance of a conflict of interest can be every bit as damaging as an actual conflict. Given the fact that it was she who sought the legal opinion, she can\u2019t possibly argue that no such appearance exists.\n\nAs for her emails, the city\u2019s policy needs to change. The city should never have routed citizens to council members\u2019 private email accounts, which aren\u2019t set up to preserve communications on public business.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the city shouldn\u2019t be delegating the task of locating and disclosing emails to the individuals whose accounts are being searched. These people not only lack the technical expertise to conduct document searches, but they also have a strong motive to withhold damaging emails they have sent or received.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://dmreg.co/1YmlDWL", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Des Moines council's tax-abatement debae is obscured by secrecy legal opinion and private email accoyo member recent decision to extend the availability of a controversial tax abatement for multi-family housing developers has nothing to do with taxes", "p": {"domain_verify": "372c291dc2b106308d26264f4fba3b10"}, "og": {"site_name": "Des Moines Register", "description": "Des Moines council's tax-abatement debae is obscured by secrecy legal opinion and private email accoyo member recent decision to extend the availability of a controversial tax abatement for multi-family housing developers has nothing to do with taxes", "title": "Editorial: City officials use private email, secret opinions", "url": "http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/opinion/editorials/2015/12/17/editorial-city-officials-use-private-email-secret-opinions/77419458/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/desmoinesregister.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Des Moines council's tax-abatement debae is obscured by secrecy legal opinion and private email accoyo member recent decision to extend the availability of a controversial tax abatement for multi-family housing developers has nothing to do with taxes", "title": "Editorial: City officials use private email, secret opinions", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/baf09fd742d9d634f5e81cedaf7960c1859539dc/c=0-21-510-531&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/DesMoines/2014/11/14/christinehensley.jpg", "creator": "@DMRegister", "site": "@DMRegister", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600025120", "fb": {"app_id": 169766623060429}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Organizations/Des Moines City Council", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Organizations/Des Moines City Council", "title": "Editorial: City officials use private email, secret opinions", "author": "The Register's Editorial", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "opinion/editorials", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/76f63ed2e2ba79c500e37c9eec46b8c869dec11d/c=0-0-510-680/local/-/media/DesMoines/2014/11/14/christinehensley.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d3ba3faf350e4aedbc889f754d58f7c2e28487e6/c=0-21-510-531/local/-/media/DesMoines/2014/11/14/christinehensley.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/fd7efc2def576d0100f09a90d5cc7dcb90841c4e/c=0-5-510-388/local/-/media/DesMoines/2014/11/14/christinehensley.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0052f5108bb725538c99cbfa6ba685e9f2ce2ce0/c=0-29-510-317&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/DesMoines/2014/11/14/christinehensley.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-12-16T23:20:56.203000-06:00", "shorthed": "Editorial: Secrecy clouds tax issue", "articleid": 77419458, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/02d37b568a36bc479e1cfaedb49824c1f076e024/c=0-29-510-317/local/-/media/DesMoines/2014/11/14/christinehensley.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6d4064f38e5ceaab516cd62c46062da2ae2e47ae/c=40-0-470-768/local/-/media/DesMoines/2014/11/14/christinehensley.jpg"}}}, "article_summary": "Given the fact that it was she who sought the legal opinion, she can\u2019t possibly argue that no such appearance exists.\nThe city should never have routed citizens to council members\u2019 private email accounts, which aren\u2019t set up to preserve communications on public business.\nSo is the fact that Hensley and fellow council member Bob Mahaffey have been using private email accounts to conduct official city business.\nWe say \u201capparently\u201d because the legal opinion is being kept confidential.\nAt the meeting, Gatto asked Hensley if she would be willing to share the legal opinion with others."}
