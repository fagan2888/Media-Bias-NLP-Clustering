To talk about beer and understand the flavor profile because I love a good Scotch Ale because it has that deep roasty caramel note to it. That's what I enjoy. Other people really like that green hoppy flavor of an IPA,\" Houk said.\n\nIt's proven effective, with a couple dozen women coming to the newly-formed events. They range in age from 21 to ladies in their 50s.\n\n\"It's been a really great ride,\" Houk said. \"It's only three months but we keep getting more and more women showing up to our events so it's exciting.\"\n\nThe rules are as free-flowing as the craft beer. Membership is free and men, we'll they're not turned away, either. The co-founders say it's just a chance for craft beer lovers to explore varieties they've never otherwise been exposed too.\n\n\"When there are all those different options and you can try a lot of different things. I think that it can bring out more of people's creativity and open up their minds a little bit,\" Tilberg said.\n\nAnd for Tilberg and her beer-loving friends, they're happy for the opportunity to get together.\n\nFeatured Stories\n\nEye on KELOLAND {{Title}} Remove Change News General Courts Web Only Crime Outdoors Events Center Non-Homepage Boredom Busters Pipeline Positively KELOLAND Technology Hunger Affordable Care Act Shops Flooding Remembering 9/11 Drought JazzFest Spring Storm Honor Flight Spencer Anniversary\n\nDoApp Health News Business News Sports\n\nAgriculture Markets Livestock Crops Politics\n\nHealthBeat Cancer Children's Health Heart Health Wellness & Nutrition General Health Beat Women's Health RX Resources What's Going Around OTC Diabetes Recalls Dental Health Men's Health\n\nPolitics South Dakota Legislature Budget Congress Taxes General Local Campaign President US Senate New Laws US House Iowa Ballot Issues Local Races Minnesota Gubernatorial\n\nEducation Funding College Elementary High School Pre K School Supplies Middle School\n\nSports Professional College High School Sports Zone Headlines Summit League Tournament Olympics\n\nBusiness Industry Your Money Matters Development Gas & Energy Legislation Economy/Stocks Employment General Health Care Technology Education Funding Tourism Banking/Finance Housing Transportation Insurance Meetings & Events Retail & Restaurants All Industries On The Move Shops Agriculture\n\nFeatured Stories Eye on KELOLAND Inside KELOLAND\n\nWeather Snow Forecast Records Rain Flooding Drought WX Corner General\n\nWorld News\n\nInvestigates GEAR UP\n\nSponsored Done\n\n\u00a9 2016 KELOLAND TV.
