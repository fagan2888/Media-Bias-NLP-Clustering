Add $48 billion to the mix for college students and the math is simple: back-to-school spending is expected to reach nearly $75 billion this year in the U.S.\n\nBut even with back-to-school spending in the billions, the retail trade organization said parents have begun looking for bargains earlier in the summer in recent years, weeks before the school bell rings. That\u2019s no surprise to Karen Shaffer, owner of Mommy and Me, a children\u2019s consignment clothing store that\u2019s been open at 3703 S.W. Burlingame Road since 2007.\n\n\u201cPeople are just more wise about how they spend their money and why,\u201d Shaffer said. \u201cGenerally they\u2019re on a budget and they\u2019re looking at the sales.\u201d\n\nBeginning in late July, right around the time of early enrollment for area schools, Shaffer said she sees more traffic in her store that sells name brand, second-hand clothing and shoes for infants through early teens.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s when we\u2019re really busy,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re out looking for jeans, shoes, clothes, just things to get started with for school.\u201d\n\nClothing is secondary for many families, said Angela Hammer, an executive team leader for logistics at Target in Topeka. They saw a \u201chigh demand\u201d for the classroom essentials several weeks before school begins, she said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more about \u2018What do I need to start school with?\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cThen it\u2019s the clothes.\u201d\n\nFor most retailers, the late summer/early fall weather plays a big role in the kind of back-to-school clothing shoppers will buy. Both Hammer and Shaffer said having transitional clothing like short-sleeve shirts, shorts and warm-weather dresses still available for the start of the school year is important given that the temperatures are still generally higher.\n\n\u201cYou can probably get by with spring and summer things before you need to head into winter clothing,\u201d said Elizabeth Kiss, a research and extension family resource management specialist at Kansas State University. \u201cThat means you have an opportunity to plan ahead, watch the sales, and look for coupons and other bargains.\u201d\n\nWhile savvy shoppers are looking for those bargains, regardless of the time of year, Hammer said providing the best customer service with adequate staffing is key to getting through the back-to-school season.\n\n\u201cWe do bring on additional people so everyone knows service and in-stocks are our priority,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want to make sure we have what our guests are looking for. We try to be strategic with where we place our team members, whether it\u2019s in our school supply or clothing section.\u201d\n\nFor Shaffer, who has been in the clothing consignment business for 23 years, a robust back-to-school shopping season usually has translated into brisk holiday sales and she expects that to hold true this year.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m anticipating the fall to be bigger,\u201d she said. \u201cIt seemed people this year had a larger budget for clothing, more than other years, especially on the bigger name brands.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Business, News, Local, Angela Deines, Local business", "og": {"site_name": "CJOnline.com", "description": "It is no surprise to anyone with school-aged children that the back-to-school season is big business.", "title": "Topeka stores see strong sales as students head back to school", "url": "http://cjonline.com/news/business/2014-08-16/topeka-stores-see-strong-sales-students-head-back-school", "image": "http://cjonline.com/sites/default/files/13620973.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "It is no surprise to anyone with school-aged children that the back-to-school season is big business.
