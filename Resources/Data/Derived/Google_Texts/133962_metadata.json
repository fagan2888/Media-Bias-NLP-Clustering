The workers, on strike, were therapists and social workers; suicides were on their minds, their concerns were all too tragically real.\n\n***\n\nOn July 5, Barbara Ragan, 83, jumped to her death. Dressed in bedclothes and slippers, she drove her car to the third floor of the parking lot at Kaiser Permanente\u2019s medical center in Santa Rosa, CA. Ignoring the pleas of witnesses below, she let herself fall \u2013 the only identification she carried was her Kaiser membership card.\n\nIt was a \u201cstatement,\u201d according to Denny Ragan, her husband. \u201cShe was very upset about them.\u201d Barbara Ragan had worked for Kaiser in South San Francisco for sixteen years, before settling in Santa Rosa. She was being treated for depression. \u201cIt was a statement of what they\u2019re doing there,\u201d Denny Ragan told the press, \u201cthe way they treat people.\u201d\n\nBarbara Ragan had been taking Prozac for more than twenty years; increasingly, however, it wasn\u2019t working. On June 15, in desperation, she asked her husband to take her to the emergency room; there it was decided she was not a threat to herself. She was not admitted, but was referred to Kaiser\u2019s adult psychiatric center, where her medications were to be adjusted. After that she phoned the advice nurse several times, seeking guidance, only to be told she was scheduled for an appointment, August 27.\n\nOn the Fourth of July, she told her husband, \u201cI can\u2019t wait that long.\u201d The next morning she left a note for her husband and her children, \u201cI love you all so much,\u201d and without further notice left her home.\n\nShe had wanted, above all, to see her therapist. Her medications weren\u2019t working and, as she wrote to her children and her husband, \u201cshe couldn\u2019t stand the pain.\u201d\n\nKaiser, based in Oakland, is the largest Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) in the country with 10 million members, 38 medical centers, 175,000 employees and 18,000 doctors. In 2014 the \u201cnon-profit\u201d Kaiser Foundation Health Plan and Kaiser Foundations Hospitals reported $3 billion in net income and $60 billion in revenues. Today, its CEO, Bernard J. Tyson, receives compensation totaling perhaps $10 million annually, not including half a dozen pensions.\n\nKaiser was founded in 1945 with a union-friendly, progressive mission \u2013 to serve working people in Northern California, most often through union-negotiated healthcare benefit packages.\n\nIts reputation is now considerably soured, most notably as a result of patient \u201cdumping,\u201d a practice first exposed in Los Angeles more than a decade ago. This was a hospital policy of discharging homeless patients and dropping them off, often in hospital gowns and socks, onto the street. One shocking episode involved the case of a\n\nparaplegic man with a colostomy bag, crawling along the pavement of skid row. City investigations led to charges against LA hospitals, including criminal charges against Kaiser. The corporation was forced to pay fines and agree to a settlement that put in place specific protocols for tracking the homeless in its hospitals, assessing their mental stability and helping find them services and lodging after discharge.\n\nNevertheless, complaints continue, including class-action suits this year alleging that Kaiser strong-arms some of the most disabled psychiatric patients into canceling their insurance plans.\n\nFew will deny that this nation is in deep crisis in treating mental illness. Perhaps most disturbing, according to federal officials 100 people a day take their own lives. Kaiser is not unaware of this. Dr. Mason Turner, the director of patient operations for regional mental health services at The Permanente Group in Oakland, writes. \u201cNo one yet has the answer to the best and most effective ways to do this\u2026As an integrated system with thousands of mental health professionals in California, Kaiser Permanente has been well-positioned to lead in delivering high-quality mental health care \u2013 and, on behalf of our members and those in need of care, we will not rest until we have reached that goal.\u201d\n\nKaiser to lead? Shirlee Zane is Sonoma County\u2019s Supervisor in the Third District. She might dispute this. Her husband, Peter Kingston, \u201ca very sweet man in his fifties,\u201d hanged himself on January 18, 2011. Speaking at the 2014 Leadership Conference of the NUHW, Zane recalled how the health care giant \u201cfailed\u201d her husband.\n\nAndy Weisskoff, then Kingston\u2019s therapist at Kaiser, also might dispute this. Kingston was financial director at Ursuline High School in Santa Rosa. He had become deeply troubled with financial problems at the school and just before Christmas, 2010, he sought help from Kaiser, using coverage provided through Ursuline. He had a brief screening then an hour-long intake interview a week later.\n\nThe problem? Zane contends that briefing was not enough. Kingston had attempted suicide once before; his first scheduled one-on-one therapy session, however, would not to be held for forty days.\n\nWeisskoff (who hosts the blog 90daystochange.com) now in private practice in Sebastopol, agrees. Citing what he calls a Kaiser \u201cscheme,\u201d he writes, \u201cThis was a scheme developed to make it seem like we were providing two relevant visits in a short period of time.\u2019 But the reality was \u201cdifferent.\u201d\n\nKaiser apparently disallows criticism. In May, Weisskoff, who had participated in the public discussion that questioned Kaiser\u2019s Santa Rosa practice, was placed on administrative leave then told he was no longer actively employed and escorted off the premises. He recalls that he had upgraded his diagnosis for Kingston \u2013 from adjustment disorder to panic disorder and major depression. He booked Kingston for an Introduction to Anxiety Disorders Group, then scheduled him for the next available appointment \u2013 in 40 days.\n\nIn retrospect, Weisskoff wishes he could have done more, he wishes he could have talked with Shirlee Zane about her husband. He wishes he could have said, \u201cI have no idea what would have happened if I was able to meet with your husband weekly during his crisis. I wish I could have seen him more frequently, but had no time in my schedule to do so. We\u2019ll never know, now, if more frequent individual sessions could have saved him\u201d\n\nShirlee Zane has been more forceful: Speaking to a Santa Rosa audience of more than 400 in September 2014, she said, \u201cMy husband might be alive today but for Kaiser\u2019s disregard for \u201cpatient-centered services.\u201d And responding to Turner\u2019s suggestions that Kaiser\u2019s critics \u201cexaggerated,\u201d that their complaints were \u201cmisleading,\u201d and to the allegation that behind this conflict lurked \u201ca labor dispute,\u201d she wrote,\u201d \u201cto blame a labor dispute for the deficiency in Kaiser\u2019s delivery of mental health services is the lowest form of scapegoating I have ever seen. As the widow of a Kaiser patient who was so grossly undertreated for severe depression that he hung himself, I am literally sickened that you have concocted such a callous and unfounded defense for the broken healthcare system.\u201d\n\nIn 2013, Kaiser patients filed a class-action suit against the HMO alleging that it failed to provide timely and appropriate mental health care and that this contributed to tragic suicides by patients.\n\nAs a result, California\u2019s Department of Managed Health Care (DMHC) levied a $4 million fine against Kaiser, also referring to Kaiser\u2019s care as \u201csystemic\u201d and \u201cserious\u201d violations of state law and ordered Kaiser to \u201ccease and desist\u201d from committing further violations of California\u2019s mental health laws, including its practice of using a parallel set of paper records that concealed patients\u2019 lengthy wait times for appointments.\n\nThe DMHC action was in part the result of a campaign initiated by NUHW therapists and social workers, the authors of the NUHW report, \u201cCare Delayed, Care Denied.\u201d NUHW represents nearly three thousand psychologists, therapists and psychiatric social workers, frontline mental health workers who provide day-to-day care for Kaiser patients with conditions ranging from autism, anxiety and bi-polar disorder to depression, schizophrenia and suicidal ideation.\n\nThe NUHW members have been joined by advocacy organizations, professional associations, and patients (but no other unions) in an ongoing campaign to improve Kaiser\u2019s mental health services. The DMHC fine, which Kaiser finally paid in August 2014, is the second largest in the agency\u2019s history.\n\n\u201cWe cannot prevent suicide if we don\u2019t talk about it,\u201d Shirlee Zane told the full house in Santa Rosa. \u201cThis is a preventable death in most cases. We have to end the silence.\u201d\n\nThis is certainly true; silence is often the result of shame, also misunderstandings, and quite rightly the wishes of family members and others for privacy. Silence is also, however, the policy of Kaiser management \u2013 it is in their interests, so it seems, to cover up discussion of this \u201ccrisis.\u201d NUHW members refer to Kaiser\u2019s policies as \u201cgag rule.\u201d\n\nKaiser retaliates against the whistleblowers. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to reward your bad behavior,\u201d a Kaiser Exec once remarked at the bargaining table. Andy Weisskoff is just one therapist dismissed by Kaiser for speaking up. In May, Kaiser NUHW members picketed facilities throughout California protesting the termination of Fremont psychologist Dr. Alex Wang, a target of Kaiser management since 2013 when he wrote \u201cPatient should be seen sooner\u201d on a patient\u2019s chart. Wang had learned that the patient would have to wait more than three weeks for a first time appointment. Three thousand Kaiser workers face the choice \u2013 keep quiet or find their job on the line.\n\nKaiser resorts to collective punishment as well; it has denied all 4000 NUHW members a contract. The therapists and social workers, and all NUHW-represented Kaiser employees, have been engaged in fruitless negotiations since 2010; the workers have rejected countless Kaiser demands for concessions \u2013 in health benefits, pensions, and staffing, demands the company knows the workers will reject. So there\u2019s more to it than concessions, says Clem Papazian, a therapist at Kaiser\u2019s Oakland Medical Center, the elected President of NUHW\u2019s Northern California U nit of Kaiser mental health clinicians. \u201cThey want to shut us up and they\u2019re willing to break our union to do that.\u201d\n\nPapazian calls the Kaiser crisis \u201csystemic,\u201d one that is now exacerbated by the thousands of new patients flooding the system as a result of Obamacare. \u201cThere just aren\u2019t enough of us to do the work. So many people have needs. There is a cascading effect. The system\u2019s not pro-active. If a struggling patient could see a clinician regularly, she/he might not become so desperate. Unfortunately, there aren\u2019t enough clinicians available to offer this routine follow-up service. When routine issues go untreated, by definition they become more acute. When more and more people are prevented from obtaining timely routine care the system becomes overwhelmed. And one result is suicides.\u201d\n\nElizabeth White, a Licensed Clinical Social Worker at Kaiser\u2019s West Los Angeles Medical Center, emphasizes life\u2019s stresses: \u201cYou\u2019ve got no job, you\u2019re fired, your workload is too much, your wife is going to leave, your husband is having an affair \u2013 it\u2019s everywhere but Kaiser doesn\u2019t seem to care, stress disorder overwhelms people, dark thoughts follow. Patient calls are answered by clerks, workers who are forced to make what are essentially medical decisions, they who have no mechanism to pass the call on to the appropriate provider.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have a system that allows the patient to connect with the caregiver, face-to-face. Our work is often about life and death, mental suffering that is stigmatized and marginalized in our society. At a time of ever-increasing need to address mental health issues. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way. What\u2019s happened in Santa Rosa and so many other places is preventable.\u201d\n\nAnd why is this happening? Papazian says, \u201cIt\u2019s no secret: Historically psychiatric services are a money loser for these hospital corporations. Kaiser is acting as if it is losing money. On the contrary\u2026they simply don\u2019t want to pay the labor costs for high-quality service. The results can be significant; group therapy brings in huge savings, perhaps as much as 80% according to Kaiser accountants.\u201d\n\nThis California story might be just another example of the state of health care in the United States; often shocking, but hardly news. It demands telling, however; it reveals after all the ongoing consolidation of neoliberal capitalism and market economy, in this case in today\u2019s hospital and its deliverance of healthcare. It exposes ruling ideologies, principles and values, not simply in the abstract but in the lived experience of the ordinary working people upon whom this system is imposed. The irrationality of this system is seen from the vantage of these workers and their patients, the latter most often workers as well. It represents what the late E.P. Thompson might have called the sheer otherness of capitalism, that is, the gulf between, in this case, Kaiser, its \u201cother way of life,\u201d that is, its values and practices, its and ideas of time and discipline and morality, and those of its workers.\n\n\u201cIn Kaiser, we follow orders that come straight from the top,\u201d says, Papazian. \u201cIt\u2019s the bottom line, never mind that it\u2019s people we work with. Kaiser wants us to collaborate with them in the business of getting business, to turn our clinics and hospitals into mills. It\u2019s a manufacturing mode; it doesn\u2019t fit human beings. We need time with the patient, time for nuance, thoughtful consideration, relationship building.\u201d\n\nThe National Union of Healthcare Workers was founded in 2009; it has since grown to 11,000 members, all in California, all healthcare workers. Its roots are deep, however, they go back to 1934, when in the aftermath of the great dockers\u2019 strike, porters in San Francisco organized the first hospital union in the country. In the 1980s and 1990s it was revived as Service Employees International Union (SEIU) Local 250, then led by insurgents who championed empowering workers, union democracy, organizing and standing up to the corporations. It grew by tens of thousands of new members in the 2000s, merged with the big Southern California SEIU local, 399, becoming United Healthcare Workers-West, 150,000 strong, a powerful force in California. This at a time when organized labor nationally was in steep decline. It was militant, never afraid to strike; it preached and practiced solidarity, including with UNITE-HERE\u2019s Local 2 in its bitter 2004 conflict with San Francisco\u2019s hotels and with SEIU in Nevada, sending organizers there and coordinating contract campaigns with UHW unionized hospitals in California. UHW-W was a progressive union \u2013 its 5,000 shop stewards were elected, as was its executive board, it opposed the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and supported universal health care plans. Its elected president, Sal Rosselli, once served as Grand Marshall of San Francisco\u2019s Pride parade.\n\nThis came to an abrupt end in 2008, when the former President Andy Stern\u2019s SEIU \u201cinternational\u201d set out to wreck this \u201cmodel union.\u201d Why? Perhaps the story was not so clear then; it is now. SEIU national leadership in 2008 represented a one-party, top down corporate \u201cunion,\u201d the country\u2019s second largest union. SEIU allowed no dissent. When this developed, as it did in California, but elsewhere as well, the result was the hostile takeover, trusteeship. In January, 2009, SEIU seized UHW\u2019s assets, fired its elected offices \u2014 5,000 elected shop stewards included \u2014 and imposed loyalty oaths and a gag rule upon remaining staff and members.\n\nThe reasons for this? They are worth recalling. UHW members and leaders had refused to continue participation in the SEIU\u2019s \u201cNursing Home Alliance\u201d \u2014 a strategy that based organizing on partnerships with employers and \u201cneutrality\u201d agreements. These agreements typically allowed employers to pick and choose which facilities would be organized, they restrict workers\u2019 rights, including the right to strike, they enforce the gag rule \u2013 even (as is so often the case in the nursing home) when the worker is the elderly, isolated patient\u2019s one and only voice in an industry notorious for neglect and abuse. The Nursing Home Alliance enshrined long- term agreements (for example, a ten-year contract for home care workers in a Washington state), all in return for employer \u201cneutrality\u201d in an election. Workers frequently complained, \u201cThe boss brought me this union.\u201d\n\nThe response was retaliation, the international leaders ordered UHW\u2019s officers to transfer 65,000 home healthcare workers \u2013 without discussion, without a vote, relegating them, whether they liked it or not, to the scandal-ridden Southern California Local 3464, then led by Tyrone Freeman, now in prison, convicted of racketeering and embezzlement. UHW refused, trusteeship followed. In an appalling episode, a triumphalist SEIU unleashed \u201cWorld War III,\u201d established a \u201cwar room\u201d in Oakland,\u201d sent in many hundreds of \u201cwarriors,\u201d Iraq talk, toy war talk with real war as background.\n\nIs this important? It is not without reason that we hear that the organized labor movement is dead. It is easy enough to see why. Alas, stories like this nightmare in California ese do not pass unnoticed. At the same time, reports from the Bureau of Labor Statistics find that labor\u2019s numerical decline continues apace; membership is now down to about 11% over all, and just more than 6% in the private sector, the lowest, we are told, since the turn of the past century, the 1900s that is. Still the Madison occupations revealed possibilities; the Chicago teachers strike raised hopes high. \u201cFight for Fifteen\u201d is a work in progress, but \u201cOur Walmart\u201d appears to be fading.\n\nOverall, the situation remains discouraging. The external challenges confronting unions today are massive. On the other hand, here in California, the state with the highest number of union members, 2.5 million, membership remains stable, and in places is growing \u2013 NUHW has grown from to 11,000 in just half a dozen years. The point is, importantly, that unions can grow.\n\nThere are factors that bode well for us \u2013 no Scott Walker here, the state is dominated by democrats; a right-to-work campaign then seems unlikely. We have some strong unions \u2013 the ILWU has held off the giant shipping companies again. It remains intact in the state\u2019s three giant ports, occupying strategic, highly sensitive positions in the world\u2019s commerce. The longshoremen\u2019s demonstration supporting \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d is a vivid reminder of labor\u2019s potentials. The two big teachers unions seem full of promise. We have an increasingly large, restive and frustrated immigrant population. And we have the bitter, ongoing experience of the foreclosure crisis. Unemployment is chronic \u2013 while Silicon Valley enjoys another gold rush and San Francisco gleams, inequalities are staggering. How can unions not grow in conditions such as these?\n\nThere are reasons; apathy, disinformation, intimidation, fear, reprisals. The wrecking of the UHW is another, an object lesson for troublemakers and visionaries alike. Unions also don\u2019t grow because they offer so little, they don\u2019t grow because they can seem indistinguishable from the employer \u2013 they enforce rotten contracts, discipline troublemakers, their officers live lives that resemble the employers \u2013 they rarely experience unemployment, dismissal, harassing supervisors, the stresses that drive desperate workers to therapists like Elizabeth White.\n\nStill, polls routinely show that workers see unions as positive. Indeed, they can grow, and do. \u201cWe\u2019re doing it every day,\u201d says NUHW President Rosselli, \u201cand we\u2019re on the defensive. We\u2019ve got this fight with SEIU, we\u2019ve got them between us and the employers. The truth is that healthcare workers today need a union now more than ever. The hospitals\u2019 profits are unprecedented, still they attack.\u201d\n\nToday, SEIU stagnates, the suffocating arrogance of 2008 is long gone, its boy wonder, Stephen Lerner, architect of the grand plan, is past history. The leadership is factionalized, plagued with defections and corruption, its perspectives offer little for its dues paying members. When Mary Kay Henry, President of SEIU, recently came to the Bay Area to build the Fight for $15 movement (a worthy cause), nothing was said about the strike of the workers at Park Merced in San Francisco, SEIU members making just more than the minimum wage. Nor of the thousands of Fresno home care workers, also SEIU members, many of who take home less than the minimum wage (once union dues have been deducted). It is estimated that perhaps half of SEIU\u2019s members make less than $15 an hour.\n\nUHW-West is now half its former size, 65,000 of its members have just this year been bureaucratically removed to another local union, this despite the bitter protests of Dave Regan, its president, the Ivy Leaguer appointed in the wake of trusteeship. Today, Regan is perhaps as despised as any labor leader in California. The reasons are legion: his consistent policy on granting concessions, at Kaiser in health benefits, pensions and staffing. At a time when the hospital giants are intent on rationalizing, on cutting jobs, forcing what amounts to an electronic speed-up, Regan has suggested that the California Labor Federation (to the astonishment of its representatives) not stand in the way, even in defense of hard won staffing rules in nursing, the sacred cow of the California Nurses Association (CNA).\n\nMore recently Regan announced a grand plan: \u201cWe\u2019re talking about working together on a scale that is unprecedented for unions and employers\u2026 We\u2019re going to create a totally different paradigm for the way unions and employers deal with each other.\u201d The \u201cwe\u201d here is SEIU-UHW and the California Hospital Association (CHA), the organization that represents the big hospitals in Sacramento. \u201cWorking together\u201d refers to the May 6, 2015 secret agreement that underscores the collusive relationship of the state\u2019s largest hospital workers\u2019 union with the industry\u2019s CEOs.\n\nIn the agreement, the \u201cnew paradigm,\u201d Regan has agreed to joint lobbying with the CHA in Sacramento aimed at boosting Medicaid payments to hospitals \u2013 by $6 billion a year. This will be, if successful, a boon for the industry, an industry already awash in cash. In return, the agreement is to enlist the hospital industry in the union\u2019s organizing efforts; hospital executives have promised to make SEIU-UHW their union of choice. CHA will SEIU give it free access to 30,000 workers; then, if the joint campaign to increase the state\u2019s Medicaid payments succeeds, another 30,000. Workers will be forced into pre-negotiated SEIU contracts that guarantee low wages and reduced benefits, prohibit picketing and strikes. Interesting here, the \u201cpartners\u201d have agreed to no \u201cnegative campaigning\u201d \u2013 that is, self-imposed silence on the conduct of the hospitals, including CEO pay, a \u201cgag rule\u201d on workers \u2013 a \u201cCode of Conduct\u201d that will eliminate the union\u2019s watchdog role and prohibit workers from criticizing their employers in the media, the courts and even in the regulatory agencies. \u201cVisionary,\u201d says California Hospitals Association CEO Duane Dauner.\n\nThe workers\u2019 who have remained in SEIU\u2019s UHW have paid a big price; they are already the victims of Regan\u2019s \u201cnew paradigm.\u201d They have, in essence, no union. Contracts are pre-negotiated, concessions are routine, democracy is a four letter word. Workers at the Sutter Health\u2019s Alta Bates Medical Center in Berkeley, strong union members since the 1960s, report that hundreds of jobs there have been lost on Regan\u2019s watch \u2013 the result of dismissals, attrition, cutbacks, subcontracting and outsourcing. They\u2019re just the latest of many to file to decertify UHW and join NUHW \u2013 they await an NLRB ruling and election.\n\nKaiser\u2019s therapists and social workers were among the first to join the new NUHW; in this they demonstrated in practice the still contested but fundamental necessity of workers to have a union of choice. Since then they have been and remain the vanguard in the resistance to the Kaiser system and the HMO giant\u2019s drive to dominate the nation\u2019s healthcare systems. They have been on strike four times now, and not just for themselves. They have made patients interests their interests \u2013 central here, their demand that mental illness be recognized as just as serious as any other illness, to have mental healthcare receive parity with other healthcare issues. In doing this, they have forced into the open fundamental issues of healthcare and how it is to be delivered. They have exposed the great gap between themselves, their patients and the employers \u2013 the gap in principles and values, in contested views of what is and what ought to be. The have resisted, as, inevitably, workers must. They have revealed what a union can be, begging the question not just of why workers need unions, but that of what kind of unions as well.\n\n***\n\nOn October 10 in Los Angeles, NUHW held its annual leadership conference. There it was announced to the members that Kaiser had offered the Northern California therapists\u2019 unit its \u201clast, best and final offer.\u201d The offer, the terms of which had been rejected before, contained one new demand, infuriating the therapists. Kaiser demanded the implementation of a system of quotas for therapists, and, more, that the quotas be enforced with discipline. Kaiser of course already has the right to discipline employees. The intention then was clear. The therapists responded by voting in support of an open-ended strike, with 88% voting in favor.\n\nShould they strike, they deserve our support. As of now (exceptions including the honorable stand of the Courage Campaign and a growing network of rank-and-file workers and mental health activists), however, these Kaiser workers fight alone. This is unconscionable. Where are the unions? Where are Kaiser\u2019s SEIU\u2019s members, and nurses, where is the CNA, where is AFSCME? Is the NUHW model somehow deficient \u2013 a militant, democratic, organizing, anti-racist, multi-gendered organization that sets as its goal empowering workers? Where are the activists, the academics, the intellectuals? Where is the discussion, where are the debates?\n\nSolidarity is not meant to be an empty word. Now is the time. Support NUHW and the Kaiser workers. No more Kaiser Suicides!
