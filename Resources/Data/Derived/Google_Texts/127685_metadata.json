After inspiring the film starring Julia Roberts, who won an Oscar for the role, Brockovich went on to become a consumer advocate and environmentalist.\n\nThe mine outside Silverton, Colorado, has continued to leak, albeit at a reduced rate, into Cement Creek, which feeds into the Animas River, which flows into the San Juan. The initial spill occurred on August 5 when the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) accidentally triggered a deluge while trying to remediate the site of Gold King Mine.\n\nRELATED: Navajo Nation 'Weeping' as Toxic Mining Spill Flows Through Reservation\n\n\"I am deeply concerned with the actions of the U.S. EPA and I stand by the Navajo Nation,\" said Brockovich in a statement announcing her visit. \"Over 20 million gallons of contaminated water have poured out and are continuing to pour out from the Gold King Mine. This needs to stop, and the U.S. government needs to clean up the mess they caused.\"\n\nBegaye has declared his intent to sue the EPA for the spill, and Navajo Nation Attorney General Ethel Branch has retained the law firm of Hueston Hennigan LLP to represent the tribe. Leading the case will be John Heuston, who also led the case against Tronox, a $5.15 billion contamination settlement of which $1 billion went to the Navajo Nation.\n\nRELATED: Navajo Nation to Get $1 Billion in Historic Kerr-McGee $5.15 Billion Cleanup Settlement\n\nThe Bureau of Reclamation is heading the federal investigation at the request of the U.S. Department of the Interior, which was asked by the EPA to investigate the exact cause. The EPA also asked Interior to make recommendations to prevent future occurrences, the Bureau of Reclamation said in an August 20 statement.\n\n\u201cThe Bureau of Reclamation is well-suited to head up this independent technical review on behalf of Interior,\u201d said U.S. Deputy Secretary of the Interior Michael L. Connor in the statement. \u201cReclamation is already active in the watershed and understands the issues. Reclamation is also credited with fast action in response to the spill by doubling water releases from the Navajo Dam on the San Juan River to dilute the spill as it moved its way down the river system.\u201d\n\nSoon after the spill, Senate Indian Affairs Committee Chairman John Barrasso (R-WY) and Vice Chairman Jon Tester (D-MT) announced they would hold an oversight hearing on the impact of the spill on the Navajo Nation. Members of Congress praised the initiatives.\n\n\u201cWe appreciate Chairman Barrasso and Vice Chairman Tester\u2019s commitment to holding a Senate Indian Affairs Committee oversight hearing on the impact of the EPA Gold King Mine spill on the Navajo Nation,\u201d said Senators John McCain (R-AZ) and Tom Udall (D-NM) in a statement on August 18. \u201cThrough our ongoing conversations with leaders of the Navajo Nation, we understand their dissatisfaction with the EPA\u2019s response to the spill, and share their concerns that toxic substances might flow onto their lands and waters. Congress has a responsibility to oversee the federal government\u2019s response to this crisis, and the Senate Indian Affairs Committee hearing will ensure that the EPA explains the public health, environmental, and economic costs of the spill, and its remediation plans, as well as addresses other problematic EPA activities involving the Navajo Nation.\u201d\n\nOn August 28 Begaye opened the San Juan River and related waterways back up for irrigation, though not for livestock. He also made a disaster-assistance request to the Federal Emergency Management Administration (FEMA), which was denied on Friday September 4.\n\n\"We are extremely frustrated with the news that both FEMA and the U.S. EPA have declined our urgent requests to continue assistance to the Navajo Nation,\u201d said Begaye in a statement quoted by KOB4 News on Sunday September 6. \u201cU.S. EPA caused this entire disaster; they have harmed the people, the water and the land. I appreciated the fact U.S. EPA took responsibility, and I was hoping for the U.S. EPA to prove to the Navajo Nation they are willing to hold themselves accountable. This action clearly shows otherwise. For years, we have consistently been at the receiving end of toxic spills and contamination with no adequate relief as the United States Government and Private Companies became wealthy off of the natural resources of the Navajo Nation.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "Erin Brockovich to tour Navajo Nation damage from Gold King Mine Spill into San Juan River.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "theresa", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/09/07/erin-brockovich-survey-gold-king-mine-spill-damage-navajo-nation-161654", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/erin-brockovich.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Erin Brockovich to Survey Gold King Mine Spill Damage on Navajo Nation"}, "abstract": "Erin Brockovich to tour Navajo Nation damage from Gold King Mine Spill into San Juan River.", "dc": {"title": "Erin Brockovich to Survey Gold King Mine Spill Damage on Navajo Nation"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/09/07/erin-brockovich-survey-gold-king-mine-spill-damage-navajo-nation-161654", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Gold King Mine Spill, Erin Brockovich, Navajo Nation", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 2}, "dcterms.date": "2015-09-07T15:30-04:00", "dcterms.title": "Erin Brockovich to Survey Gold King Mine Spill Damage on Navajo Nation"}, "article_summary": "RELATED: Navajo Nation 'Weeping' as Toxic Mining Spill Flows Through Reservation\"I am deeply concerned with the actions of the U.S. EPA and I stand by the Navajo Nation,\" said Brockovich in a statement announcing her visit.\n\"Over 20 million gallons of contaminated water have poured out and are continuing to pour out from the Gold King Mine.\nLeading the case will be John Heuston, who also led the case against Tronox, a $5.15 billion contamination settlement of which $1 billion went to the Navajo Nation.\n\u201cThe Navajo Nation has been culturally and economically devastated by the impact of the Gold King Mine Spill, and we need help to address this crisis,\u201d Begaye said in a statement on September 4.\nThe initial spill occurred on August 5 when the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) accidentally triggered a deluge while trying to remediate the site of Gold King Mine."}
