giant BP stemming from its 2010 oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nWithout comment, the justices declined to hear the case Monday, effectively affirming a lower court\u2019s decision against BP.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBP has been fighting for years about the terms of the landmark class-action settlement it made after the Deepwater Horizon explosion and 87-day spill from the Macondo well.\n\nThe company wants the courts to rule that businesses and individuals who were not directly affected by the spill should not be entitled to settlement funds.\n\nBP has said that hundreds of millions of dollars out of the $28 billion it has paid in settlement claims and cleanup costs have gone to parties not directly affected.\n\nA lawyer for the claimants applauded the court\u2019s decision, saying it allows the process to move forward.\n\n\u201cI am gratified that, finally, our clients\u2019 claims can be processed, as they should have been long ago if not for BP\u2019s cruel antics that were allowed to delay the settlement that BP itself agreed to,\u201d Joe Rice, a partner in the firm Motley Rice, said in a statement.\n\nIn BP\u2019s August filing, it asked the court to stop payments to parties \u201cwhose purported losses were not fairly traceable to the spill ... such as lawyers who lost their law licenses and warehouses that burned down before the spill occurred.\u201d\n\nBusiness groups, such as the Chamber of Commerce, joined in urging the Supreme Court to take the case, writing that \u201cit may discourage future defendants from settling cases, portending a spike in costly class litigation as parties opt to forgo the efficiencies of class settlement.\u201d\n\nThe government of BP\u2019s home country the United Kingdom also weighed in on its behalf, telling the court BP has gone to great lengths to atone for the spill.\n\nClaimants to the settlement asked the court not to review the last ruling, writing, \u201cThis case is about a contract that BP signed but now wishes it hadn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nHalliburton and Transocean each contributed more than $1 billion to the settlement fund for their roles in the disaster.\n\nIn addition to the settlement funds, BP faces up to $18 billion in civil penalties thanks to a September court finding that it was grossly negligent for the spill.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description":
