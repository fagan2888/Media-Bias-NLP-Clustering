His obituary in The New York Times called him \u201cOff the Literary Grid\u201d in its headline and said \u201che was famous for eschewing fame\u201d; his sometime partner, the poet Linda Gregg, told The Paris Review he \u201cnever cared if he was poor or had to sleep on a park bench.\u201d But Gilbert\u2019s fans sometimes rue that his commitment to a free, unconstrained, and often-impoverished lifestyle helped obscure what legacy he might have had.\n\nElizabeth Gilbert, author of The Signature of All Things, had never heard of Jack Gilbert when she discovered him by odd coincidence in 2006\u2014thanks, in part, to their shared last name. Since then, she told me, he\u2019s become \u201cthe poet laureate of her life.\u201d In our interview by phone, we discussed a favorite line from \u201cA Brief for the Defense,\u201d a poem that defends joy against its critics and insists on the centrality of pleasure and wonder in even dark realms of human experience, and how Jack Gilbert\u2019s ode to joy became the defining text of Elizabeth Gilbert\u2019s life.\n\nCapacity for wonder is the subject of Gilbert\u2019s latest, The Signature of All Things, her first novel in 12 years. The book chronicles the life and obsessions of Alma Whittaker, a 19th-century naturalist fascinated by the workings of flora and fauna. Gilbert\u2019s celebrated books of nonfiction include Eat, Pray, Love and Committed: A Love Story.\n\nElizabeth Gilbert: In 2006, I taught creative writing at the University of Tennessee at Knoxville\u2014a rotating chair that brought a new visiting writer each year. I was amused to learn that the writer before me had also been named Gilbert, a fact that caught my eye. (I started jokingly calling the position The Gilbert Chair.) The man had been a poet named Jack Gilbert, whom I\u2019d never heard of. I started asking around about him. It turned out that he\u2019d made quite an impression on the students, and the things I heard about him fascinated me. Jack Gilbert hadn\u2019t taught them much about the business of poetry, or how to get published. Instead, he just tried to inspire them to have brave, full lives.\n\nOne of the graduate students told me he grabbed her arm one day, as she was leaving class.\n\n\u201cDo you have the courage to be a poet?\u201d he said. \u201cThe jewels that are hiding inside you are begging you to say yes!\u201d\n\nBecause he said these kinds of things, the students were all very taken with him.\n\nSo I found one of Jack Gilbert\u2019s books and started to read. I fell in love with him completely\u2014with his poems, but also with his unusual biography. He became the poet laureate of my life, and has been ever since then, for what he wrote and how he wrote and how he regarded his vocation.\n\nEither you are a realist who says the world is terrible, or a na\u00efve optimist who says the world is wonderful and turns a blind eye. Gilbert takes this middle way.\n\nJack Gilbert was born in Pittsburgh in the 1920s. He worked in steel mills and then went out to become a poet. In the 1960s, he published his first book\u2014which was nominated for a Pulitzer, and won the Yale Prize. Here was this charismatic, incredibly handsome, beautiful, and captivating person\u2014in other words, everything you want your young poet to be. He became pretty famous for a poet, photographed for Vogue and so on, and could have easily banked on that for a long time. Instead, he disappeared.\n\nHe went to live in Europe for 20 years: He lived on mountaintops in Greece, lived in Denmark, went to Italy, had love affairs, never published but just kept writing. He scrapped by as best he could, and allowed himself to be completely forgotten. He was completely uninterested in fame, even bored by it. All he wanted to do was focus on his poetry and publish, oh, every 20 years. He did just two major interviews in his life, a brilliant one for the Paris Review, and another one with the famous editor Gordon Lish. Lish asked him how isolation had affected his career. Gilbert laughed and said, \u201cI suppose it\u2019s been fatal, but I don\u2019t really care!\u201d\n\nGilbert\u2019s work is Whitmanesque\u2014it\u2019s grandiose, romantic, and very passionate. He\u2019s only interested in the big mysteries: God, sex, love, suffering, redemption. He doesn\u2019t dabble in anything short of that. And he lived a life that didn\u2019t dabble in anything short of that.\n\nHe wrote what may be my very favorite poem, \u201cA Brief for the Defense,\u201d late in his life; there\u2019s maturity in it no youth could ever muster. It feels like something that should be in Ecclesiastes\u2014it\u2019s biblical in its wisdom and scope. The poem takes on his the central trauma of human consciousness, which is: What are we supposed to do with all this suffering? And how are we supposed to live?\n\nThe first lines of the poem are:\n\nSorrow everywhere. Slaughter everywhere. If babies\n\nare not starving someplace, they are starving\n\nsomewhere else. With flies in their nostrils.\n\nSo it begins with an admission of how devastating the world is, how unfair and how sad. He goes on to say what he\u2019s seen from a life of watching very carefully: women at the fountain in a famine-stricken town, \u201claughing together between / the suffering they have known and the awfulness / in their future.\u201d He describes the \u201cterrible streets\u201d of Calcutta, caged prostitutes in Bombay laughing. So there\u2019s this human capacity for joy and endurance, even when things are at their worst. A joy that occurs not despite our suffering, but within it.\n\nWhen it comes to developing a worldview, we tend to face this false division: Either you are a realist who says the world is terrible, or a na\u00efve optimist who says the world is wonderful and turns a blind eye. Gilbert takes this middle way, and I think it\u2019s a far better way: he says the world is terrible and wonderful, and your obligation is to joy. That\u2019s why the poem is called \u201cA Brief for the Defense\u201d\u2014it\u2019s defending joy. A real, mature, sincere joy\u2014not a cheaply earned, ignorant joy. He\u2019s not talking about building a fortress of pleasure against the assault of the world. He\u2019s talking about the miraculousness of moments of wonder and how it seems to be worth it, after all. And one line from this poem is the most important piece of writing I\u2019ve ever read for myself:\n\nWe must risk delight. We can do without pleasure,\n\nbut not delight. Not enjoyment. We must have\n\nthe stubbornness to accept our gladness in the ruthless\n\nfurnace of this world.\n\nThis defines exactly what I want to strive to be\u2014a person who holds onto \u201cstubborn gladness,\u201d even when we dwell in darkness. I want to be able to contain both of them within me at the same time, remain able to cultivate joy and wonder even at life\u2019s bleakest.\n\nSometimes you are lucky enough to meet people who can do this. When I was a diner waitress in Philadelphia in the early \u201990s, there was a homeless guy who used to come in and sit at the counter, who we all grew fond of and used to feed. He was brilliant, erudite, and well-read, and corrected me when I was a cheeky idiot 22-year-old and called James Jones, who wrote the beautiful novel From Here to Eternity, \u201ca one-hit wonder.\u201d Which is an idiot thing for a 22-year old to say. He said, \u201cHey kid, you can talk like that after you\u2019ve made one masterpiece.\u201d\n\nHe had trained as concert pianist when he was younger, and he lost his finger in an accident when he was well on his way to becoming famous. With this missing finger on one hand, of course, he would never become a concert pianist. He\u2019d grown up in this very wealthy, very brittle family, and had never experienced much tenderness until he went to the hospital with his crushed finger. He told me: \u201cI\u2019ll tell you something, kid. The nurses were so kind to me, they were so warm to me, and they were so sweet in a way I had never known before.\u201d I remember him holding up his hand then, showing me the missing finger, and saying, \u201cIt was worth it!\u201d\n\n\u201cI have cancer,\u201d she said, and this big grin spread across her face. \u201cIsn\u2019t that interesting?\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s the \u201cstubborn gladness\u201d Jack Gilbert was talking about. When you weigh the sorrows against these tiny moments of grace\u2014on the balance, it is still worth it to be a human being.\n\nI don\u2019t think you can write that poem as a young person. I don\u2019t even know if you can write that poem as an old person who hasn\u2019t been paying close attention. And that\u2019s a fundamental feature of Jack Gilbert\u2014a commitment to paying attention, to not wanting to miss it, and not wanting to turn an eye from it. He has another poem that\u2019s a conversation between him and the gods, who offer him a chance to be famous if he would just give up his weird life. But he doesn\u2019t settle for that. He says:\n\nLet me fall\n\nin love one last time, I beg them.\n\nTeach me mortality, frighten me\n\ninto the present.\n\nGive me something real, he\u2019s asking, and he\u2019s not fooling around. Who makes a prayer that includes the words \u201cfrighten me\u201d? That\u2019s a bold thing to ask for. It\u2019s not \u201cfrighten\u201d me in the sense of bungee jumping or surfing\u2014it\u2019s wanting to stand on the edge of the abyss and look in, look in carefully with an alert gaze. It\u2019s a commitment to literature, and a commitment to living.\n\nI saw the same quality in my great aunt Lolly, who has not had an easy life\u2014but she\u2019s the most stubbornly glad person I\u2019ve ever met. When she was 85, I visited her and she said to me, \u201cGuess what? Guess what I have, Liz?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cI have cancer,\u201d she said, and this big grin spread across her face. \u201cIsn\u2019t that interesting?\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s part of stubborn gladness, too: to regard things, even the hardest things, as\u2014at their base\u2014interesting. It\u2019s hard to say that without sounding like a Pollyanna, but the people who you know who can really do this are not innocents. You see it, too, in Steve Job\u2019s last words: Oh wow. Oh wow. Oh wow.\n\nFull-on wonder, even at the moment of death.\n\nListen to the language we use to talk about creative process: \u201cOpen up your vein and bleed.\u201d \u201cKill your darlings.\u201d That is a really fucked-up relationship you have with your work!\n\nJack Gilbert addresses this experience directly in \u201cA Brief for the Defense\u201d: \u201cIf the locomotive of the Lord runs us down,\u201d he writes, \u201cWe should give thanks that the end had magnitude.\u201d That\u2019s another one I always lean on. At least it was magnificent\u2014you lived and died, that\u2019s magnificent. To be able to summon some sort of wonder and gratitude for the fact you got to live and die is the highest calling. It is the best way to go through life\u2014it beats it almost any other model of thinking I\u2019ve ever encountered. I like it better than anything.\n\nAs someone who struggles with anxiety and cowardice, as we all do, I\u2019m profoundly inspired by this full-on commitment to wonder, to wonder as a response to anguish or difficulty. It makes everything a puzzle, right? A catastrophe is nothing but a puzzle with the volume of drama turned up very high. For now, I\u2019m best with stubborn gladness when taking on the challenges in my writing life. Because writing can be a very dramatic pursuit, full of catastrophes and disasters and emotion and attempts that fail. My path as a writer became much more smooth when I learned that, when things aren\u2019t going well, to regard my struggles as curious, not tragic.\n\nSo, How do we get through this puzzle? That\u2019s funny, I thought I could write this book and I can\u2019t, instead of, I have to drink a bottle of gin before 11:00 to numb myself at how horrifying this is. You could almost call it a spiritual practice I\u2019ve cultivated over the years. I really worked to create that kind of relationship\u2014so that it\u2019s not a chaotic fight. I don\u2019t go up against my writing and come out bloody-knuckled. I don\u2019t wrestle with the muse. I don\u2019t argue. I try to get away from self-hatred, and competition, all those things that mark and mar so many writers\u2019 careers and lives. I try to remain stubborn in my gladness.\n\nWe have this very German, romantic idea that if you\u2019re not in pain, and if you\u2019re not causing pain by making your art, then you\u2019re not really doing it right. I\u2019ve always questioned that. That\u2019s one thing that\u2019s drawn me to Jack Gilbert\u2014especially when I learned about his relationship to the Beats, who he felt were talented, but blowing it. They weren\u2019t reverent enough towards the work, he thought, to want to live clean, sober, disciplined lives in respectful awe of what they were doing. I think this comes from a romantic view\u2014I mean, listen to the language we use to talk about creative process: \u201cOpen up your vein and bleed.\u201d \u201cKill your darlings.\u201d I always want to weep when people speak about a project and say: \u201cI think I finally broke its back.\u201d That is a really fucked-up relationship you have with your work! You\u2019re trying to crack its spine? No wonder you\u2019re so stressed out! You\u2019ve made this into battlefield! We should know enough about the world to realize that anything that you fight fights you back.\n\nHe offers an uncompromising challenge to his readers: Make the very most of your life, no less.\n\nI actually have this bright young writer who I really love and who I\u2019m semi-mentoring. When he told me that he\u2019d finished his book, he related his triumph in terms of sex and death: \u201cI love my book. I feel like I killed it. And now it\u2019s so hot\u2014I\u2019m going to put this thing out into the world, so everybody can fuck it!\u201d\n\nOk, he\u2019s 25. But I\u2019ve been to other parts of the world where it is not the assumption that we must beat our art into submission. Indonesian artists say you should begin and end your work with a prayer of gratitude\u2014it\u2019s a more reverent kind of collaboration. I respond to that attitude better. I think it\u2019s what people have been doing for a lot longer than German Romanticism, which still has its claws in us. I like the idea of collaborating with something respectfully, rather than trying to break it and kill it.\n\nBut to write this way, to live this way, takes courage. I have an uncle who\u2019s a great reader of poetry, and I shared Jack Gilbert\u2019s work with him. He said he didn\u2019t like him, and I asked why. My uncle said, \u201cI like the poems, but I don\u2019t like the way the poems make me feel I haven\u2019t lived a brave or interesting enough life.\u201d That\u2019s the pain and pleasure of reading Gilbert. He offers an uncompromising challenge to his readers: Make the very most of your life, no less. In this, he holds up a model of something I would so love to be. Sometimes I brush up against in it sideways ways, and then skirt away from it again\u2014because I long for security and affirmation more than I long for the purity of a life spent in examination of the poetic mysteries.\n\n\u201cDo you have the courage to be a poet?\u201d Gilbert asked the graduate student, after all. We need courage to take ourselves seriously, to look closely and without flinching, to regard the things that frighten us in life and art with wonder. We tend to surround ourselves with the things that make us feel safe, but can then wall us in. We\u2019re aspirational, we\u2019re ambitious, we\u2019re insecure, we want comforts. Live bravely when you\u2019re young, we say. And maybe again when you retire, if you play your cards right.\n\nJack Gilbert refused that argument: No, I\u2019m just going to live that way every single day of my life, thanks.
