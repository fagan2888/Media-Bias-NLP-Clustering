You not only have to have a policy, but you have to educate them. You have to train them.\"\n\nThe move, backed by safety advocates from around Jacksonville, is designed to curb distracted driving and help keep drivers, pedestrians and bicyclists safer.\n\nBrown made the announcement in front of City Hall, urging others to take the pledge of no texting and driving.\n\n\n\nAs of January, 44 states, including Florida, have banned text messaging for all drivers. Even though there is already a state law against it, the mayor said the Legislature needs to do more, including banning the use of hands-free devices, as well.\n\n\n\nAccording to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, in 2013 alone, 3,154 people were killed and approximately 424,000 were injured across the country in crashes involving distracted drivers.\n\n\n\nDistracted driving includes any activity that diverts a driver's attention away from operating a vehicle, including texting, using a mobile phone, eating, drinking, talking, grooming, reading, using navigation systems, watching videos or adjusting audio devices.\n\n\n\nExperts say drivers using mobile phones increase the risk of a crash by four times, the same risk as driving with an illegal blood-alcohol level. According to information provided by Brown's office, texting while driving increases a driver's crash risk by 23 times.\n\n\n\nA 2012 NHTSA study found an estimated 660,000 drivers use mobile devices at any given moment during the day -- and that number continues to rise.\n\nCopyright 2015 by News4Jax.com.
