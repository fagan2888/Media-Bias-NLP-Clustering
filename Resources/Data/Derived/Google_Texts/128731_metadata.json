Instead, by state law, the state Supreme Court appointed Cooper, also a Democrat, to an eight-year term scheduled to end this year.\n\nIn a statement to News Channel 5 of Nashville\u2019s Phil Williams, Cooper said \u201cthe office took a conservative approach to the expenditure of taxpayer dollars\u201d in choosing not to fight.\n\n\u201cThis office determined that Tennessee\u2019s participation in the lawsuit would not have been an appropriate use of limited state resources because participation would have cost money during difficult economic times while providing no additional benefit to the state,\u201d Cooper said.\n\nAmericans For Prosperity Tennessee Chapter Director Andrew Ogles told Tennessee Watchdog that Cooper still wasn\u2019t acting in the state\u2019s best interests.\n\n\u201cHis job is to represent Tennessee,\u201d Ogles said.\n\n\u201cGiven our history with expanded health care, Tennessee should have had an important leadership role in that initiative, because our opposition comes from our own state experience, our own experience with TennCare nearly bankrupting Tennessee.\n\n\u201cThe fact that he is unable to make that connection in my mind says he\u2019s out of touch with Tennesseans and out of touch with the facts.\u201d\n\nAs Tennessee Report said in 2012, former Gov. Phil Bredesen, a Democrat, faced with ballooning health-care costs, at one time had to cut 350,000 Tennessee residents from TennCare, the state\u2019s version of Medicaid.\n\nTennessee Watchdog left messages via phone and email seeking comment from Cooper\u2019s office, but no one immediately responded Monday.\n\nAs Tennessee Watchdog reported, Obamacare will likely cost the state as much as $1.4 billion over the first five years of implementation, according to the Tennessee Comptroller\u2019s Office.\n\nHealth insurance rates in Tennessee, meanwhile, are going up at least 50 percent, said Brenda Williams, spokeswoman for the Tennessee Medical Association, the state\u2019s largest organization of physicians, in an interview last year.\n\nAdditionally, some local governments, such as those in White County, are raising taxes by $1 million per year so all county employees will have health insurance.\n\nMeanwhile, as Tennessee Watchdog reported last year, Smith and Nephew, a medical device manufacturer in Memphis, laid off 100 employees in February. Company officials blamed Obamacare\u2019s 2.3 percent Medical Device Tax on yearly sales as the culprit.\n\nMemphis is home to several companies that make medical devices, such as hip replacements and heart stints.\n\nAs Tennessee Watchdog reported last year, Obamacare has introduced a litany of costly entitlement programs, courtesy of a $15.1 million federal grant, through the Prevention and Public Health Fund.\n\nThe fund pays for, among other things, putty for Tennessee\u2019s smokers to squeeze to control cravings, as well as breath mints. Williamson County, one of Tennessee\u2019s most affluent areas, received $20,000 to fund a computer-based fitness program to test students\u2019 aerobic abilities.\n\nCooper gave no assurances that he would join Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, a Republican, in another Obamacare-related lawsuit against the federal government, this one on the grounds that states opting not to create their own health exchanges under Obamacare, including Tennessee, don\u2019t have to participate in the employer mandate.\n\nThe mandate levies a tax on businesses with 50 or more employees that fail to comply with provisions of the law.\n\nThe editors of National Review also agree with Pruitt\u2019s interpretation of the law and called upon governors, attorneys general and lawmakers in other states without their own exchanges to form a united front with Oklahoma.\n\nOn Monday, Pruitt\u2019s spokesman, Aaron Cooper, told Tennessee Watchdog that the case is before Judge Ronald White in Oklahoma\u2019s Eastern District and a decision could come any day.\n\n\u201cNo other state has joined,\u201d the spokesman said.\n\n\u201cIndiana filed its own separate lawsuit with similar claims.\u201d\n\nIf appealed, the Oklahoma case would then go to Denver\u2019s 10th Circuit Court.\n\nContact Christopher Butler at chris@tennesseewatchdog.org or follow him and submit story ideas on his official Facebook page.\n\nGet regular Tennessee Watchdog updates through our Facebook or Twitter accounts\n\nClick here to get Tennessee Watchdog articles sent directly to your email inbox (click Tennessee under \u201cWatchdog News Updates)\n\nLike Watchdog.org?
