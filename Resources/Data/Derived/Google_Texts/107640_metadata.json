Those narratives backfired, I argued, because Trump cleverly co-opted them and deployed them against conservative and libertarian ideas. I used an essay by Ilya Shapiro as a springboard, in part because Shapiro\u2019s essay nicely repeated a common refrain on the right that NFIB v. Sebelius, the 2012 Obamacare case, was illegitimate because it was only a political decision by Chief Justice John Roberts.\n\nA few hours later, my co-blogger Randy Barnett took offense at my post for wrongly accusing him of trying to delegitimize Sebelius in his recent Heritage lecture. According to Randy, nothing that he said in his lecture last week fits into my thesis that critics of Sebelius tried to undermine its legitimacy.\n\nThere seems to be some confusion about my original post, so let me clarify. My post wasn\u2019t about Randy\u2019s speech last week. My post was about political messaging on the right that helped fuel Trump\u2019s rise, not one speech delivered after Trump already became the presumptive nominee. I want to make clear that I did not intend to say that Randy\u2019s speech last week tried to delegitimize Sebelius, or tried to dismiss it as political, or otherwise said that the decision was non-legal and therefore should be overturned.\n\nIf Randy wants his statements to be the focus, though, it\u2019s worth recalling what he said in 2012 when Sebelius was in the news. I assume Randy would not deny that he tried to undermine the legitimacy of Sebelius then. For example, here\u2019s Randy in National Review a few days after the decision came down:\n\nRandy Barnett, the Georgetown law professor who was an intellectual spark plug for the legal arguments against Obamacare, is optimistic about the future. \u201cThe fact that this decision was apparently political, rather than legal, completely undermines its legitimacy as a precedent,\u201d he tells me. \u201cIts result can be reversed by the people in November, and its weak-tax-power holding reversed by any future Court without pause.\u201d\n\nThis quote was widely circulated in the weeks following Sebelius as an example of the conservative campaign to discredit the chief justice and his opinion. The quote was featured in The Washington Post, the New Republic, the Los Angeles Times, and the Christian Science Monitor, among other places.\n\nRandy made somewhat similar comments at the blog. Notably, Randy first announced that an opinion by the chief upholding Obamacare would be \u201ctainted as political\u201d a month before the opinion came out. After the already \u201ctainted\u201d decision was handed down and we could get a chance to read it, Randy blogged at length about the circumstantial evidence that Roberts had switched his vote because he caved to political pressure. In another post, Randy wrote that the opinion was a \u201cpolitical deal\u201d and that any similarities between Sebelius and other Roberts decisions \u201cdoes not make [Roberts] bending himself into a pretzel to uphold a law when the screws were put to him any less political.\u201d \u201cAs I have said,\u201d Randy added, \u201c8 justices acted on principle: 4 on good principles and 4 on bad principles.\u201d\n\nIt may be that Randy said one thing publicly in 2012 but that he believes something different today. If so, that\u2019s a change he\u2019s best situated to explain. But my post wasn\u2019t about Randy\u2019s new position.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Why Randy's umbrage is misplaced, and a reminder of what Randy said about the legitimacy of the Obamacare case when it was decided.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Why Randy's umbrage is misplaced, and a reminder of what Randy said about the legitimacy of the Obamacare case when it was decided.", "title": "A reply to Randy Barnett on Chief Justice Roberts and the Obamacare case", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2016/05/09/a-reply-to-randy-barnett-on-chief-justice-roberts-and-the-obamacare-case/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=https://img.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-3000x1568.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2016/05/09/a-reply-to-randy-barnett-on-chief-justice-roberts-and-the-obamacare-case/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "supreme court, sebelius.", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "supreme court, sebelius."}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5b3f\"", "article_summary": "Notably, Randy first announced that an opinion by the chief upholding Obamacare would be \u201ctainted as political\u201d a month before the opinion came out.\nAccording to Randy, nothing that he said in his lecture last week fits into my thesis that critics of Sebelius tried to undermine its legitimacy.\nI used an essay by Ilya Shapiro as a springboard, in part because Shapiro\u2019s essay nicely repeated a common refrain on the right that NFIB v.
