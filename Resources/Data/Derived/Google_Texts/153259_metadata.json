In addition, it identifies a number of populations that are underserved and at higher risk of HIV, including gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM); people who inject drugs; adolescent girls and young women; prisoners; sex workers; and others. Scaling up efforts to reach these populations and localities\u2014and particularly efforts to increase access to antiretroviral therapy (ART)\u2014will be key to ending the AIDS epidemic, the UNAIDS report observes.\n\nAt the conference, I had the opportunity to sit down with Mary Mahy of UNAIDS to learn more about this new report and what its findings mean for the global HIV/AIDS community (see video above).\n\nA full copy of the report, along with a summary fact sheet, slides, infographics, related videos, and other resources can be found on the UNAIDS Gap Report Campaign page .", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "blog.aids.gov \u2014 HIV Policy & Programs.
