OAK BROOK, Ill. — As the world’s biggest hamburger chain fights to hold onto customers, McDonald’s on Friday unveiled a new marketing strategy and ads that it says will emphasize the “love” in its long-running “I’m Lovin’ It” slogan.

As part of the push, McDonald’s released TV ads that will begin airing this week, including an animated video where Batman and the Joker, a mail carrier and a dog, and a blue donkey and a red elephant share McDonald’s food. The upbeat spot ends with the words “Choose Lovin’.”

The push to identify with love and positivity in the minds of customers comes at a challenging time for McDonald’s, which is facing shifting eating habits, intensifying competition and growing calls by workers and labor organizers for higher pay and a union. Sales for its flagship U.S. division have continued to struggle. In November, sales fell 4.6 percent at established U.S. restaurants.
