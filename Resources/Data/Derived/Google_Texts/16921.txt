What role does the federal government have, if any, in health care? In a prerecorded interview for the Outbreak News This Week Radio Show this Sunday, I talked to Libertarian Party Presidential candidate Austin Petersen about this question and much more.

Petersen says he would overturn Obamacare and seek out market alternatives to health and wellness and went into some detail on this.

I also asked him about what he would do concerning the following topics- the VA Health System, the myriad of federal government health agencies under the HHS and issues of drug abuse.

How does Petersen’s health care views stack up against his main opponent for the LP Presidential race- Former New Mexico Governor Gary Johnson.

The 35-year-old Petersen also talked about his “consistent pro-life ethic”.
