Getty Images\n\nElaine Stritch, a Broadway actress and singer whose career spanned seven decades, died this morning at her home in Birmingham, Michigan. She was 89.\n\nMs. Stritch, known for her brassy voice, flamboyant personality, public struggles with alcohol addiction, and her signature uniform: a crisp white shirt worn over black tights and no pants, had undergone surgery for stomach cancer earlier this year, said her friend Hunter Herdlicka. The exact cause of death is unknown, he said.\n\n\u201cShe was such a survivor, I didn\u2019t know if she was going to to go any minute or in another five years,\u201d he said. Ms. Stritch last performed four months ago, in Detroit, when she sang Stephen Sondheim\u2019s \u201cSend in the Clowns\u201d at a benefit, he said.\n\nDirector Hal Prince remembered Ms. Stritch as \u201can original. There was no one else like her,\u201d he said. \u201cShe was brilliant, so creative, and irreplaceable. There was nobody who played a role she originated who could remotely come close to what she created. And she was stunningly honest, incapable of lying\u2014to a fault, I would say. I loved her and I\u2019ll miss her.\u201d\n\nMs. Stritch, born on February 2, 1925 in Detroit, Michigan, made her Broadway debut in 1946 in the comedy \u201cLoco.\u201d She went on to perform in \u201cPal Joey\u201d and \u201cBus Stop\u201d and to become a leading lady for Noel Coward and Stephen Sondheim, and she is closely associated with Mr. Sondheim\u2019s music, especially \u201cThe Ladies Who Lunch\u201d from \u201cCompany.\u201d\n\nThe documentary filmmaker DA Pennebaker memorably captured her recording that song for the show\u2019s cast album in 1970. In a poignant but terrifying scene, Ms. Stritch almost has a breakdown because she can\u2019t hit the notes during a late-night recording session. \u201cOh, shut up,\u201d she screams to her own voice when listening to a recording of the track, realizing how bad she sounds. She came back a day or so later and nailed the number.\n\nMs. Stritch married John Bay in 1973 after meeting him while living abroad in London. His family owned Bay\u2019s English Muffins, and Ms. Stritch sent her friends a box of them every Christmas, said her longtime agent, Joel Dean.\n\nShe told the WSJ. Magazine in February that meeting Mr. Bay \u201cwas the first time I felt like, I don\u2019t know whether I\u2019m in love or not, but I want to get in his pocket and I want him to take me home. I never talked about sex because I didn\u2019t know what the hell that was, but I knew I wanted to be in John\u2019s pocket. Being in love is being in somebody\u2019s pocket.\u201d\n\nShe and Mr. Bay returned to the U.S. in 1982, and Mr. Bay died that same year, sending Ms. Stritch into a depression. She gave up drinking in her 60s, staying sober for 25 years. In her 80s, she began allowing herself a drink or two a day \u2014 a cosmopolitan, said Herdlicka.\n\nHer one-woman show, \u201cElaine Stritch at Liberty,\u201d premiered at the Public Theater in 2001 before transferring to Broadway. She won a Tony for the performance, which brought her back into the limelight in her 70s with its confessional and heartfelt tone \u2014 she told stories about encounters with Marlon Brando, dating Ben Gazzara and of being an understudy for Ethel Merman. Then there were the songs.\n\nIn 2005, Ms. Stritch began performing a cabaret act at the Cafe Carlyle in the Carlyle Hotel. The indefatigable performer appeared as a guest star on NBC\u2019s \u201c30 Rock\u201d in 2007, playing Alec Baldwin\u2019s mother. In 2010, she starred in Mr. Sondheim\u2019s \u201cA Little Night Music\u201d on Broadway. A documentary about her life, \u201cElaine Stritch: Shoot Me,\u201d came out earlier this year.\n\nShe lived at the Carlyle until 2013, when she moved back to Birmingham to be closer to her family.\n\n\u201cSometimes she would say, \u2018You know, I feel like I\u2019m about to leave the building,\u2019\u201d said Herdlicka. \u201cAnd sometimes she would say, \u2018I really don\u2019t want to yet.\u2019\u201d She is not survived by any children.\n\nPia Catton contributed to this article.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Elaine Stritch, a broadway actress ansd singer known for a brassy voice and strong personality, died today at home in Birmingham, Mich.", "title": "Elaine Stritch, Broadway Actress and Singer, Dies at 89", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2014/07/17/elaine-stritch-broadway-actress-and-singer-dies-at-89/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-DS969_stritc_E_20140717133341.jpg"}, "site": "WSJspeakeasy", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Arts", "article.headline": "Elaine Stritch, Broadway Actress and Singer, Dies at 89", "description": "Elaine Stritch, a broadway actress ansd singer known for a brassy voice and strong personality, died today at home in Birmingham, Mich.", "article_section": "Arts", "author": "Stefanie Cohen", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Speakeasy Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Speakeasy", "article.summary": "Elaine Stritch, a broadway actress ansd singer known for a brassy voice and strong personality, died today at home in Birmingham, Mich.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-07-17T19:36:14-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-140", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2014/07/17/elaine-stritch-broadway-actress-and-singer-dies-at-89/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-SEB-82330", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Arts", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Elaine Stritch, a broadway actress ansd singer known for a brassy voice and strong personality, died today at home in Birmingham, Mich.", "title": "Elaine Stritch, Broadway Actress and Singer, Dies at 89", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2014/07/17/elaine-stritch-broadway-actress-and-singer-dies-at-89/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/blogs/img/WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Speakeasy", "article.id": "BL-SEB-82330", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-08-07T14:14:34-04:00"}, "article_summary": "Getty ImagesElaine Stritch, a Broadway actress and singer whose career spanned seven decades, died this morning at her home in Birmingham, Michigan.\nBeing in love is being in somebody\u2019s pocket.\u201dShe and Mr. Bay returned to the U.S. in 1982, and Mr. Bay died that same year, sending Ms. Stritch into a depression.\nHis family owned Bay\u2019s English Muffins, and Ms. Stritch sent her friends a box of them every Christmas, said her longtime agent, Joel Dean.\nMs. Stritch last performed four months ago, in Detroit, when she sang Stephen Sondheim\u2019s \u201cSend in the Clowns\u201d at a benefit, he said.\nIn 2005, Ms. Stritch began performing a cabaret act at the Cafe Carlyle in the Carlyle Hotel."}
