More confirmation that the V-A Hospital scandal being investigated nationwide has reached Wichita.

A letter sent to members of the Kansas congressional delegation Friday confirms what KAKE news first reported May 23rd of what Senator Pat Roberts calls a secret list.

In an interview with KAKE's Chris Frank Senator Roberts says, "We don't know how many there are on this so-called 'secret list.' And we do not know if, in fact, they need help. Or what is their status? And until we find that out, that's a real problem. "

Roberts says despite the issue of a secret list, he doesn't believe the issues at the Dole VA Medical Center compare with the allegations of wrongdoing at the Phoenix VA hospital where as many as 40 veterans reportedly died while waiting for care.

Roberts says the Dole VA Hospital has a terrible I.T. or information technology system for tracking patients -- even saying it goes back to the old Microsoft DOS operating system. Roberts thinks it contributes to the problem.

Roberts says he's also disappointed with how the VA informed him of the list. The senator says he went to the Dole VA Medical Center Friday morning for an in-person briefing. But he says administrators didn't say anything about the non-VA approved waiting list.

Roberts says later that afternoon he received a letter by fax explaining further details about VA hospital issues including unauthorized lists. The letter says "the.. lists placed Veterans at risk." "One of the lists belonged to Wichita." Roberts says, "And I don't know why that was not reported to me at ten o'clock in the morning."

Roberts says, "Is there a secret list? Yes. How many veterans are on that? Still don't know that. The biggest question, the most important question is what kind of shape are they in? Are they getting the right kind of treatment? We are endeavoring now to find out all that."
