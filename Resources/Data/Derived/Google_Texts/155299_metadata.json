The expansion\u2019s 492,121 January enrollment was 34 percent higher than state projections for July.\n\nEven with the federal government reimbursing Ohio for all of the program\u2019s benefit costs, how can the Ohio Department of Medicaid continue the Obamacare expansion without legislative approval?\n\nODM does not need a new Obamacare expansion appropriation because the agency \u201chas broad authority under Ohio law to operate the Medicaid program,\u201d Joint Medicaid Oversight Committee director Susan Ackerman told Ohio Watchdog via email.\n\n\u201cAppropriations for the Medicaid budget are set at the line item level and not by category of service or population,\u201d Ackerman said. \u201cDepartment of Medicaid may pay for Medicaid services from any of their Medicaid service-related line items up to the appropriation set by the General Assembly.\u201d\n\nIn other words, as long as ODM\u2019s total expenditures fall within limits set by state lawmakers, spending approved for traditional Medicaid recipients \u2014 children, pregnant women, the physically disabled, the elderly and families below the federal poverty line \u2014 can be used for the Obamacare expansion instead.\n\nODM\u2019s enrollment projections have been wildly inaccurate, with high Obamacare expansion enrollment offset by low enrollment from those previously eligible. In January, Ohio had 125,457 more Obamacare expansion enrollees and 149,656 fewer traditional Medicaid enrollees than expected.\n\nBy using appropriations meant for traditional Medicaid recipients for the Obamacare expansion, Republican Gov. John Kasich\u2019s administration can avoid an emergency request for more money to cover the expansion Kasich implemented unilaterally.\n\nBecause the federal government pays for 100 percent of Obamacare expansion benefits and only 62 percent of Ohio\u2019s traditional Medicaid benefits, ODM still expects to have state money left in its total budget June 30.\n\nState taxpayers will eventually be stuck with a huge bill if the Obamacare expansion continues, but short-term federal funding makes the expansion \u201cfree\u201d for states until 2017.\n\nThe left-leaning Urban Institute projected in 2012 that expanding Medicaid would cost Ohio taxpayers $4 billion through 2022. Kasich insists all of the expansion\u2019s costs are paid for with \u201cOhio money,\u201d which is demonstrably false.\n\nAfter adding working-age, able-bodied childless adults to Ohio\u2019s Medicaid program in 2013, the Kasich administration turned to the Ohio Controlling Board for permission to spend $2.56 billion in Obamacare money between Jan. 1, 2014 and June 30, 2015.\n\nKasich touts the program\u2019s skyrocketing enrollment as great news for the state, and he built his budget for fiscal years 2016 and 2017 on the assumption Medicaid expansion will continue.\n\n\u201cGov. Kasich\u2019s unilateral expansion of ObamaCare is set to run more than a billion dollars over budget in just the first 18 months,\u201d Jonathan Ingram, research director for the free-market Foundation for Government Accountability, said in an email to Ohio Watchdog.\n\n\u201cMore able-bodied adults have been put on Medicaid welfare than the Kasich administration thought would ever enroll. Barely a year in, Ohio\u2019s Medicaid expansion costs are already spiraling out of control,\u201d Ingram continued.\n\n\u201cWhat happens when the state has to start paying its share of Medicaid expansion costs? Gov. Kasich has already pushed nearly 500,000 able-bodied adults to the front of the line, while nearly 40,000 children and adults with developmental disabilities languish on waiting lists for services,\u201d Ingram said.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s proposed funding cuts to pediatric hospitals and is now pushing to kick pregnant women off the program,\u201d Ingram added, concluding, \u201cWith these kinds of cost overruns, who else will Kasich put on the chopping block when the ObamaCare expansion bill comes due?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ohio's Obamacare Medicaid expansion will continue until at least July despite burning through $2.56 billion in federal funding four months early.", "og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Ohio's Obamacare Medicaid expansion will continue until at least July despite burning through $2.56 billion in federal funding four months early.", "title": "No money, no problem for Ohio Obamacare expansion - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/03/Obama-Kasich-AP.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-06-10T15:27:28+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/204043/ohio-obamacare-money/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Ohio's Obamacare Medicaid expansion will continue until at least July despite burning through $2.56 billion in federal funding four months early.", "creator": "@jasonahart", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/03/Obama-Kasich-AP.jpg"}, "title": "No money, no problem for Ohio Obamacare expansion - Watchdog.org", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Health Care", "published_time": "2015-03-06T04:00:21+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-10T15:27:28+00:00"}, "news_keywords": "John Kasich, Kasich, Obamacare expansion, Ohio Medicaid expansion, Kasich Obamacare expansion, Kasich Medicaid expansion, Ohio Department of Medicaid, Ohio Medicaid spending, Ohio Obamacare spending"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde5c0\"", "article_summary": "ODM\u2019s enrollment projections have been wildly inaccurate, with high Obamacare expansion enrollment offset by low enrollment from those previously eligible.\nEven with the federal government reimbursing Ohio for all of the program\u2019s benefit costs, how can the Ohio Department of Medicaid continue the Obamacare expansion without legislative approval?\nBy Jason Hart | Ohio WatchdogOhio\u2019s Obamacare Medicaid expansion will continue until at least July, despite burning through $2.56 billion in federal funding four months early.\nJohn Kasich\u2019s administration can avoid an emergency request for more money to cover the expansion Kasich implemented unilaterally.\nIn January, Ohio had 125,457 more Obamacare expansion enrollees and 149,656 fewer traditional Medicaid enrollees than expected."}
