In a private exchange, city employees are given choices between multiple health insurance plans at rates subsidized by the city.\n\n\u201cIf we can start making an impact in [health insurance costs], then it will help our city\u2019s budget,\u201d said Ed Zuercher, the city manager.\n\nThe city currently pays for 80 percent of the premium for health care costs, leaving the other 20 percent to be covered by employees.\n\nAn excise tax, commonly referred to as the \u201cCadillac Tax,\u201d presents another possible issue for the city, Kyle said. It was created as part of the federal Affordable Care Act and calls for a 40 percent tax on benefits above a certain threshold. It would be paid by insurers and sponsors of health care plans and could impact the city as soon as 2018, Kyle said.\n\n\u201cIt is very expensive, so what we have to look at is how we can reduce that cost for the plans,\u201d he said.\n\nVery few local or state governments have made the switch to a private exchange. Ohio will be the first when it switches over in July of this year.\n\n\u201cWe might be pioneers if we decide to do this, but we aren\u2019t pioneers from the perspective of the private sector. CenturyLink is on the exchange, Kellogg is on an exchange,\u201d Kyle said. \u201cThere are some big employer groups who have done this already.\u201d\n\nThe city has other options if they decide not to go into the private exchange, with many of these options shifting more of the cost onto the employee, including reducing coverage of pharmaceuticals and increasing copays and deductibles, Kyle said.\n\nThe task force also suggested engaging employees with wellness programs, making them reflect on their health and pursue a healthy lifestyle, both of which would potentially lower costs, Kyle said.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day we just need to look at ourselves and ask, \u2018Are we providing the best possible service to our employees?\u2019\u201d said District 5 councilman Daniel Valenzuela. \u201cAre they happy? Are they healthy? That\u2019s what we should be focused on. I think we are close to figuring a lot of this stuff out.\u201d\n\nThe task force will meet with the subcommittee in June at the latest to discuss what direction they should take.\n\nContact the reporter at Jzbuntin@asu.edu.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "author": "Zack Bunting", "og": {"site_name": "Downtown Devil", "description": "The city is looking at ways to cut costs associated with its employee's health care.
