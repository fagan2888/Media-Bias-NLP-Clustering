Also, there is increasing anxiety as to how the EU\u2019s economic uncertainties could affect the sales of finished products.\n\nOn the other hand, Russian pollock producers, whose quota has increased 5% year-on-year to 1.72m metric tons, have the potential to boost the sales of double-frozen H&G products as the ruble has slumped over 40% against the dollar in a year.\n\n\u201cRussian producers seem to have offered the H&G for double-frozen product to Chinese secondary processors at $1,500/t for the upcoming season,\u201d said a fourth source. \u201cThe offering prices stay stable but they could easily go down. Russian producers could earn profits in rubles buoyed by the super weak currency.\u201d\n\nAlaskan producers have also yet to settle the prices of H&G products with Chinese processors, who typically procure the raw materials after the Lunar New Year holidays.\n\nThis year, the Lunar New Year falls on Feb 19 compared to Jan. 31 in 2014, meaning Chinese re- processors have enough time to negotiate prices.\n\nMarketing of surimi\n\nMeanwhile, Alaskan producers are calling for an increase in the prices of surimi products as market players have seen the shortage worldwide.\n\nFor tropical surimi, raw material catches have been unfavorable in Thailand and China.\n\nIn India, fishermen are said to continue to harvest more shrimp and squid rather than fish for surimi because of good prices. Even for surimi species, Indian processors have seen higher profitability in the sales of frozen whole fish than of surimi products.\n\nIn Hokkaido, Japan, the output of pollock and Atka mackerel surimi in 2014 was below that of the previous year. Surimi inventory in Japan was as low as 57,000t as of the end of Oct 2014, marking a consecutive 17-month year-on-year drop.\n\nAlaskan pollock has become the only reliable source for most of the surimi (imitation crab meat) product market, except for Russia which has banned the import of seafood from Western countries since last summer.\n\nRussia is now keen to procure tropical surimi as Thailand\u2019s custom figures show that surimi exports to that nation jumped 3.5 times to 910t in Nov 2014.\n\nFor Japanese surimi buyers, the devaluation of the yen is the big challenge in the procurement of tropical surimi. But as Japan-bound Alaskan pollock surimi has traditionally been quoted in yen, the weakening of the yen could impact both Alaskan producers and Japanese importers.\n\n\u201cWe have seen the price gap among markets, especially between Japan and other regions such as the EU and S.Korea,\u201d said the executive for the at-sea sector producer. \u201cThe gap was as wide as 20-30 yen for the 2014 B season. Japan has been an important market but we have to rectify the disparity.\u201d\n\nBiggest concern\n\nA prominent concern in 2015 for Alaskan pollock producers is the sales of pollock roe. With markets limited to Japan and South Korea, the output reached only some 60,000t in 2014, together with Russian-origin eggs.\n\nProduction for 2015 is expected to remain unchanged at 2014 levels although there could be more carried-over inventories of raw materials due to the slower sales of mentaiko (salted/spiced roe product) in Japan.\n\nAlaskan producers are likely to increase the mako (fully-matured roe) product composition as muchas possible to maintain prices.\n\nThe huge drop in oil prices is a positive factor for Alaskan producers this year. However, it could be off-set if the fleets have to move great distances and if their operations are longer in order to reduce the salmon by-catch ratio.\n\n\u201cOverall, total production cost could increase,\u201d said the executive with an inshore-plant producer. As examples, he cited the increase in the minimum wage in Alaska, the higher burden due to \u2018Obamacare\u2019, and environmental-related expenditures.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Undercurrent News", "description": "You may also like: Russian pollock prices under pressure as sector fights to keep export tax breaks Sources: Pacific Seafood could buy all of Icicle, though break-up on cards US January-November 2014 pollock exports top $1bn Alaska pollock catchers eye [\u2026]", "title": "Alaska\u2019s Bering Sea pollock season kicks off with uncertainty on prices", "url": "https://www.undercurrentnews.com/2015/01/19/minato-tsukiji-6/", "image": "https://css.undercurrentnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Alaska-pollock-300x187.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "robots": "noarchive", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "But as Japan-bound Alaskan pollock surimi has traditionally been quoted in yen, the weakening of the yen could impact both Alaskan producers and Japanese importers.\nBy Masahiko Takeuchi, Minato-Tsukiji.comThe pollock fishery in Alaska\u2019s Bering Sea for the 2015 A season will open at noon on Jan 20, with producers asking for higher prices in major product forms.\nThe huge drop in oil prices is a positive factor for Alaskan producers this year.\nJapan has been an important market but we have to rectify the disparity.\u201dBiggest concernA prominent concern in 2015 for Alaskan pollock producers is the sales of pollock roe.\nAlaskan producers are likely to increase the mako (fully-matured roe) product composition as muchas possible to maintain prices."}
