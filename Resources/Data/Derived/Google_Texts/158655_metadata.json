Wonderful, that is, until this passage, \u201cThat was during the Reagan Administration, when many of us suspected that Reagan had some form of dementia, but no one could do anything about it. The country was running on automatic.\u201d\n\nReagan\u2019s post-presidential Alzheimer\u2019s disease diagnosis thus becomes an opportunity for the New Yorker writer to write off his entire presidency as an exercise in dementia. I remember the Reagan administration. When the left wasn\u2019t complaining that Reagan was either napping or horseback riding at the ranch, it was busy bellyaching about his costly and supposedly dangerous military buildup, his supposedly budget-busting tax cuts, and his breaking of the air traffic controllers union. Reagan, in this paradoxical view, manages to be simultaneously checked-out and malevolently, potently effective.\n\nAnd who is the \u201cus\u201d in the New Yorker\u2019s \u201cmany of us suspected\u201d? The New Yorker editor\u2019s colleagues at the magazine? The readers of the article? The community of intelligent people who might subscribe to the New Yorker? Reagan, by defeating the evil Soviet Communist empire and igniting economic growth in America, did more for the world, more for freedom and prosperity, than any of them ever did.\n\nLater in the same issue of the New Yorker is a wonderful profile of Sir Jonathan Ive, the Apple design executive that the magazine describes as \u201cone of the two most powerful people in the world\u2019s most valuable company.\u201d\n\nEarly in his career, Ive worked for a London-based design consulting company named Tangerine, founded by Clive Grinyer. The New Yorker reports that in spring of 1992, \u201cbefore a general election that the Labour Party was expected to win, after 13 years of Conservative Party rule,\u201d the Tangerine partners visited Apple in San Francisco. \u201cWhen they landed back in London, they were greeted by the news that the Conservatives had won. \u2018It was fucking depressing,\u2019 Grinyer recalled,\u201d the New Yorker says.\n\nThis is, more or less (the California weather and something about a rejected bathroom sink design are also mentioned), the explanation given for Ive\u2019s move to America. As if the reasonable reaction to an electoral victory by Margaret Thatcher\u2019s successor over the party that had led Britain into its pre-Thatcher statist malaise was to flee the country.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to be a left-winger to use an Apple computer or appreciate its design. This column was written on one, and Rush Limbaugh regularly talks about his love for Apple products. But the New Yorker profile breezes along as if it makes perfect sense that this Apple executive who now rides around in a chauffeur-driven Bentley and has a Gulfstream V private jet would have bolted Britain in reaction to a Conservative electoral victory. After all, Ive\u2019s known for his sense of aesthetics, right? And no one with good taste could possibly have right of center politics.\n\nThe New Yorker film critic Pauline Kael said in a December 1972 speech, after Nixon had won re-election in a landslide victory over George McGovern, that \u201cI live in a rather special world. I only know one person who voted for Nixon. Where they are I don\u2019t know. They\u2019re outside my ken.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m too young to have voted for Nixon. But one thing that seems to have endured in the more than 40 years since Kael\u2019s famous remark is the cloistered politics of the magazine\u2019s editorial staff. For an institution that prides itself on its sophistication and culture, it strikes me as disappointingly closed-minded.\n\nMaybe I\u2019m biased\u2014the magazine called my most recent book \u201cloony.\u201d But it\u2019s one thing for the New Yorker to run left-wing editorials or nasty reviews of books by center-right authors. It\u2019s another thing for them to insert an attack on Ronald Reagan into an article about grammar, or an attack on the British Conservative Party into an article about Apple. It\u2019s a sad reminder of the grating, smug conformity of American elite opinion, and of the way in which having even mildly conservative politics in urban, literary America can make a person feel almost like a countercultural rebel.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Another day, another cheap liberal smear.", "title": "The New Yorker's Demented Attack on Ronald Reagan", "url": "http://reason.com/archives/2015/02/23/the-new-yorkers-demented-attack-on-ronal", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14247266693643.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@reason", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14247266693643.jpg", "description": "Another day, another cheap liberal smear.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "<em>The New Yorker's</em> Demented Attack on Ronald Reagan"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "Politics", "published_time": "2015-02-23T21:30:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/ira-stoll"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "article_summary": "It\u2019s another thing for them to insert an attack on Ronald Reagan into an article about grammar, or an attack on the British Conservative Party into an article about Apple.\nThere was a wonderful article by an editor at the magazine, Mary Norris, about commas.\nWonderful, that is, until this passage, \u201cThat was during the Reagan Administration, when many of us suspected that Reagan had some form of dementia, but no one could do anything about it.\nReagan, in this paradoxical view, manages to be simultaneously checked-out and malevolently, potently effective.\nOne of the most annoying traits of left-wingers is their tendency to assume that you, too, must share their political views."}
