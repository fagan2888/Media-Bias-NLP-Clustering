Red Alert Politics editor Francesca Chambers appeared on PBS‘s ‘To the Contrary‘ this week, arguing that Obamacare is hurting job growth, particularly for women.

She was joined by Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.), Hadley Heath of the Independent Women’s Forum and Erin Matson of RH Reality Check. The women discussed that much of recent job growth for women was in low-paying service jobs. Francesca argued that Obamacare was making it harder for women to find higher-paying jobs.

“There’s a lot of businesses that are cutting down to part-time jobs, to less hours,” Francesca said. “And that’s really hurting women in this economy.”

The ladies also discussed the Pope’s recent caution against getting obsessed with banning homosexuality and other issues the Catholic Church has long condemned.

Francesca argued that the Pope’s statements weren’t sensational, but that he was merely telling people to focus on more areas of the Gospel than just contraception or gays.

The women also talked about women’s empowerment and the possible role of the United Nations in the process. Francesca said that giving women a powerful role in society was almost impossible without political stability, but that the U.S. or U.N. could not ensure political stability all around the world.
