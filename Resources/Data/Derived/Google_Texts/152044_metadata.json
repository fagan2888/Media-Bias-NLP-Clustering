C.L. \"Butch\" Otter, who is seeking a third term.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Times-News reports that Balukoff's campaign says the candidate did not answer the question seriously because the man had refused to say who he worked for while following Balukoff for nearly a month.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"(Balukoff) wasn't treating him like a member of the public or a journalist because we knew this guy was working for Otter or one of his allies,\" campaign spokesman Mike Lanza told The Associated Press. \"So he wasn't giving him a serious answer.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nLanza said Balukoff voted for Democrat Barack Obama in 2008 and Republican Mitt Romney in 2012. Balukoff considered voting for John McCain but decided against it when Sarah Palin became McCain's running mate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"As he's said before, he doesn't just vote the party line,\" Lanza said. \"He tries to check individuals and their experience, and what their ideas are and what they represent.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nOtter's campaign responded to the RGA ad by blasting Balukoff for the video in a news release.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"While he can't recall who he voted for, it is apparent that Balukoff supports a liberal agenda including higher taxes, Obamacare and the re-introduction of wolves,\" it says. \"Balukoff's stance on issues is a far cry from values important to Idahoans.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe RGA has spent nearly $700,000 on advertisements attacking Balukoff, the most outside spending in the Idaho governor's race.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Balukoff has spent nearly $3.2 million of his own money to campaign against Otter.\n\n\n\n\n\n___\n\n\n\n\n\nInformation from: The Times-News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Republican Governors Association released a video Tuesday with footage of Balukoff telling an RGA cameraman he would have to see if he could remember who he voted for six years ago.", "title": "AJ Balukoff dismisses latest attack ad from Otter", "og": {"site_name": "KBOI", "description": "The Republican Governors Association released a video Tuesday with footage of Balukoff telling an RGA cameraman he would have to see if he could remember who he voted for six years ago.", "title": "AJ Balukoff dismisses latest attack ad from Otter", "url": "http://kboi2.com/politics/aj-balukoff-dismisses-latest-attack-ad-from-otter", "image": "http://static-12.sinclairstoryline.com/resources/media/88f995f1-f26e-48b0-a0c1-c39cb4668a02-141024_AJ_Balukoff.jpg?1445931763087", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://static-11.sinclairstoryline.com/resources/media/88f995f1-f26e-48b0-a0c1-c39cb4668a02-141024_AJ_Balukoff.jpg?1445931763087", "description": "The Republican Governors Association released a video Tuesday with footage of Balukoff telling an RGA cameraman he would have to see if he could remember who he voted for six years ago.", "site": "@kboitv", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "AJ Balukoff dismisses latest attack ad from Otter"}, "author": "Sinclair Broadcast Group", "blitz": "mu-cc36119f-f4dca522-3261b206-4b3bbd3f", "robots": "index, follow", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "keywords": "politics,ID", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/kboi2", "published_time": "2014-10-29T00:00:00+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=0.5"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd6f76\"", "article_summary": "Meanwhile, Balukoff has spent nearly $3.2 million of his own money to campaign against Otter.\nThe RGA has spent nearly $700,000 on advertisements attacking Balukoff, the most outside spending in the Idaho governor's race.\nLanza said Balukoff voted for Democrat Barack Obama in 2008 and Republican Mitt Romney in 2012.\nOtter's campaign responded to the RGA ad by blasting Balukoff for the video in a news release.\n\"(Balukoff) wasn't treating him like a member of the public or a journalist because we knew this guy was working for Otter or one of his allies,\" campaign spokesman Mike Lanza told The Associated Press."}
