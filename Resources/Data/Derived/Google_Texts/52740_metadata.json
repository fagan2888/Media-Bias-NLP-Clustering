Svante P\u00e4\u00e4bo\u2019s \u201cNeanderthal Man: In Search of Lost Genomes\u201d is an account of the first sequencing of Neanderthal DNA by the molecular biologist who led the project and assembled the team who pulled it off. The book shuttles back and forth between P\u00e4\u00e4bo\u2019s own story \u2014 his personal life has been as eventful as a soap opera, although he recounts it with a minimum of drama \u2014 and, if not the full nitty-gritty of genetics research, then at least a goodly chunk of the nitty. It\u2019s a job characterized by grinding repetition, disappointment, bickering, frustration, anxiety and then, when you least expect it, a precious and revelatory insight into the workings of nature and the long-lost world of human prehistory.\n\nTruth be told, DNA sequencing is pretty wonky stuff, but perhaps it\u2019s P\u00e4\u00e4bo\u2019s own passionate investment in the undertaking that makes his story so exciting to read about; \u201cNeanderthal Man\u201d does for paleogenetics something like what Steven Spielberg did for the legislative process in \u201cLincoln.\u201d P\u00e4\u00e4bo began his career as a Swedish medical student with a keen amateur interest in Egyptology. He went to work as a junior researcher at an Uppsala lab that had \u201cmastered the then-novel methods of cloning and manipulating DNA by introducing it into bacteria.\u201d His friendship with a Finnish Egyptologist inspired him to try something new: isolating the DNA in very old tissue \u2014 namely, mummies. To test if this could be done, P\u00e4\u00e4bo bought some calf liver from a supermarket and \u201cmummified\u201d it in a low-temperature lab oven. The stench soon tipped his colleagues off to his secret side project, but fortunately no one told his professor about it until he\u2019d moved on to actual mummy tissue, supplied by his Egyptologist friend.\n\nThis project helped get P\u00e4\u00e4bo a gig as a postdoctoral fellow with the biochemist Allan Wilson at the University of California at Berkeley (\u201ca demi-god, in my view\u201d). It also gave him inklings of the two greatest challenges he\u2019d face in the future: the degradation of DNA molecules after an organism\u2019s death and what P\u00e4\u00e4bo refers to as \u201cthe plague of contamination.\u201d Water and oxygen are the primary threats to the long double helix of DNA, and as tissue decays, the strands break apart into smaller pieces. Sequencing \u2014 that is, reconstructing \u2014 a genome from such material is \u201ca monumental task, much like doing a giant jigsaw puzzle with many missing pieces, many damaged pieces and lots and lots of extra pieces that would fit nowhere in the puzzle.\u201d When P\u00e4\u00e4bo finally obtained enough Neanderthal DNA to attempt this feat in the late 2000s, it required \u201ca cluster of 256 powerful computers\u201d working for days at a time to map a single run.\n\nBut even before they could do that, P\u00e4\u00e4bo and his team at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, had to rustle up enough of those broken bits of Neanderthal DNA. This required extracting the fragments from old bones and creating copies of the DNA using a process called polymerase chain reaction, or PCR. The unfortunate thing about PCR is that it\u2019s so good at amplifying DNA that it also multiplies whatever other random genetic material happens to have settled on your specimen. Some of this might come from the bacteria that decompose flesh, but a lot of it is human: hair, skin, saliva and other microscopic particles of contemporary human DNA from the people who touch the specimen or simply move through the room where it\u2019s kept. This fresh DNA is so robust it can proliferate like crazy during PCR and overwhelm the fragile old DNA you want to study.\n\nPreventing contamination is the backbeat of \u201cNeanderthal Man,\u201d a major obsession of P\u00e4\u00e4bo\u2019s. He writes frankly of his contempt for \u201cflashy ancient DNA results that did not meet the scientific criteria our group considered necessary,\u201d and the willingness of two high-profile journals \u2014 Nature and Science \u2014 to publish papers about these results without exercising due diligence. He dismisses reports of DNA retrieved from 17-million-year-old leaves or purported dinosaur bones as \u201cludicrous\u201d and \u201coutlandish\u201d claims that grab headlines and mislead the public. Any report claiming to have retrieved DNA older than tens of thousands of years, he insists, must come from samples contaminated by contemporary DNA.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The scientist who sequenced the Neanderthal genome describes his quest to find what makes us human", "author": "Laura Miller", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The scientist who sequenced the Neanderthal genome describes his quest to find what makes us human", "title": "Our Neanderthal heritage", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/02/16/our_neanderthal_heritage/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/02/neanderthal_man.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The scientist who sequenced the Neanderthal genome describes his quest to find what makes us human", "creator": "@magiciansbook", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/02/neanderthal_man.jpg", "title": "Our Neanderthal heritage", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Our Neanderthal heritage", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Books, Editor's Picks, neanderthal man: in search of lost genomes, Neanderthals, svante paabo, What to Read, wtr", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc2f4\"", "article_summary": "Svante P\u00e4\u00e4bo\u2019s \u201cNeanderthal Man: In Search of Lost Genomes\u201d is an account of the first sequencing of Neanderthal DNA by the molecular biologist who led the project and assembled the team who pulled it off.\nPreventing contamination is the backbeat of \u201cNeanderthal Man,\u201d a major obsession of P\u00e4\u00e4bo\u2019s.\nBut even before they could do that, P\u00e4\u00e4bo and his team at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, had to rustle up enough of those broken bits of Neanderthal DNA.\nTopics: Books, Editor's Picks, neanderthal man: in search of lost genomes, Neanderthals, svante paabo, What to Read, wtr, Entertainment NewsI came for the cavemen, but I stayed for the geeky nail-biter of a story about doing historic science in a climate of fierce international competition and rapid technological innovation.\nThis fresh DNA is so robust it can proliferate like crazy during PCR and overwhelm the fragile old DNA you want to study."}
