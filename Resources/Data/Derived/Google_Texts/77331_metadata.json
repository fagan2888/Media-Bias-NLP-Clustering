In this case, we are talking about something controversial -- NBA players meeting for Bible study and prayers, as opposed to staying out late at night enjoying the bright lights and the other pleasures common among multimillionaire sports stars.\n\nThe headline: \"N.B.A. Pregame Routine: Stretch. Tape Ankles. Join Hands in Prayer.\"\n\nAt the heart of the story is Andrew Lang, a former NBA player who now serves as a team chaplain -- which makes me wonder if he is now actually the Rev. Andrew Lang, an ordained minister. Why does Lang not receive a clergyperson's title, under Associated Press style? I don't know for sure, but I have noticed that this seems to happen more often with African-Americans than with white clergy, for some reason. Here's the opening:\n\nATLANTA -- Like so many of his N.B.A. peers, Andrew Lang chose to stay close to the game when his playing days came to an end. But the second act of his career did not relocate him behind a front-office desk or onto a coach\u2019s chair or inside a broadcast booth.\n\nIt brought him, instead, to a small auxiliary locker room at Philips Arena, bare except for some padded folding chairs. There, before every Atlanta Hawks home game, Lang fulfills his responsibilities as the team\u2019s chaplain, taking prayer requests and imparting a prepared message to players before they step onto the court.\n\nSome nights, Lang might sit there alone. Some nights, he might find himself holding hands and praying with nearly a full N.B.A. squad. Whether or not anyone shows up, Lang has made it his duty for the last 14 years to be there, ready to help.\n\nTruth be told, this story is surprisingly positive and well researched. But there are important holes in it.\n\nApparently, the chapel pro-level chapel tradition dates to 1979 and one of the key early players was All-Star forward Bobby Jones, long known for his work in the Fellowship of Christian Athletes and similar networks. The story notes that the first small congregation included the legendary Julius \"Doctor J\" Erving and Chuck Daly, then an assistant coach with the 76ers.\n\nSo where did this story come from? I think we can see a hint in paragraph in which the Times notes that \"all 30 N.B.A. teams have volunteer chaplains, with no guidance or oversight from the league.\" Uh-oh. That sounds dangerous, doesn't it? These meetings might, you know, be some form of free exercise of religious freedom, dealing with all kinds of controversial and judgmental doctrines.\n\nSo who opposes these meetings? There was some some controversy back when Jeff Van Gundy, then coach of the New York Knicks, claimed that the chapel services were distractions that could hurt a team. Lang noted that the players that frequently attended Knicks services -- Allan Houston, Kurt Thomas and Charlie Ward -- consistently avoided getting into trouble off the court. See what I mean about dangerous moral judgments?\n\nThus, readers are told:\n\nOpposition to chapel services still exists, though it tends to be discreet. One former N.B.A. head coach, granted anonymity to speak freely on the subject, said that pregame chapel services were not uniformly productive.\n\n\u201cGod\u2019s not a good-luck charm,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said that some players attended chapel because they felt peer pressure from teammates or coaches. And chaplains, he said, sometimes appeared to have ulterior motives, whether it was trying to make connections with the players or promoting their personal projects.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s not real, it can be worse than useless,\u201d he said.\n\nSo what is the issue here and what information -- not opinion, information -- could have helped readers understand the issue explored in this report?\n\nFirst of all, it would have helped to have known more about the denominations, or nondenominational ministries, that work with most of these chaplains. How many are actually ordained? How many have churches of their own? Why not provide these facts? Are these \"generic\" chapel services or what?\n\nThere is no mention of ministries involving Catholic priests, for example, and there are no references to mainline, progressive churches being involved. Is this story rooted in discomfort with evangelical Protestantism and, in particular, African-American churches that are truly evangelical or Pentecostal? A few simple facts about these chaplains would have helped.\n\nIf journalists say something linked to religious faith is controversial, and have to use anonymous voices to tell the story, then it is crucial to provide basic religious facts that shed light on the situation. It's journalism. Let readers know the basic facts.
