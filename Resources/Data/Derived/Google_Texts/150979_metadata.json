Use that data to identify problems, such a breakdown in staff communications skills that made a patient's stay less than ideal. \"That avoidable suffering that is organization derived . . . identifying it as such and labeling it as such, I think that people in healthcare will respond to that challenge. That's why we're in healthcare, after all: to relieve suffering,\" Lee told Becker's. Make it obvious to patients what doctors do to help them. Simple steps like making an effort to send an email to other colleagues involved in a patient's case while the patient is there, will make it apparent that all doctors are up to speed on his or her condition.\"There's clearly a change underway toward being organized around patients' needs,\" Lee said.\n\nPain management also plays a role in patient satisfaction scores, according to a recent study, and one way to boost them is through an interdisciplinary approach developed by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to treat pain, FierceHealthcare previously reported. The protocol includes an intense three-week \"boot camp\" for inpatients that aims to improve function and decrease reliance on pain medications by improving function, eliminating opioids and using tools to assess pain.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here's the article\n\n- read the blog post\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n3 ways to manage patient pain\n\nPain control tied to patient satisfaction\n\nPatient experience surveys can guide low performers\n\nCosgrove: Patient experience key to healthcare quality", "article_metadata": {"description": "Although there's not much doctors can do about patients suffering from unavoidable pain, such as condition symptoms and side effects from treatment, Thomas Lee, M.D.of Boston's\u00a0Brigham and Women's Hospital tells Becker's Hospital Review that they can reduce avoidable suffering caused by snags in the system.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Although there's not much doctors can do about patients suffering from unavoidable pain, such as condition symptoms and side effects from treatment, Thomas Lee, M.D.of Boston's\u00a0Brigham and Women's Hospital tells Becker's Hospital Review that they can reduce avoidable suffering caused by snags in the system.", "title": "3 ways hospitals can reduce patient suffering", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/3-ways-hospitals-can-reduce-patient-suffering/2014-03-21", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Brigham and Women's Hospital,Care Delivery,Patient Care & Outcomes,patient satisfaction,patient suffering,Thomas Lee", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "article_summary": "Lee, who also serves as chief medical officer for Press Ganey, recommended several strategies to reduce patient suffering, including:Define patient suffering and reduce it.\nTo learn more:- here's the article- read the blog postRelated Articles:3 ways to manage patient painPain control tied to patient satisfactionPatient experience surveys can guide low performersCosgrove: Patient experience key to healthcare quality\nAlthough there's not much doctors can do about patients suffering from unavoidable pain, such as condition symptoms and side effects from treatment, they can reduce avoidable suffering caused by snags in the system, especially emotional suffering.\nThomas Lee, M.D., of Boston's Brigham and Women's Hospital and colleagues are on a mission to reduce the physical pain, fear, anxiety and discomfort associated with patient suffering, Becker's Hospital Review reported.\nThat's why we're in healthcare, after all: to relieve suffering,\" Lee told Becker's."}
