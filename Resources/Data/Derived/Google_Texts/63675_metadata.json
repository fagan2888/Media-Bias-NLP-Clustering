It\u2019s open enrollment time. During this time, you can make choices about health insurance. You can compare deductibles, calculate premiums, check coverage, and read policies. Or you can do nothing, and your insurance will automatically renew. If you have employer-sponsored insurance, individual insurance, MNSure insurance, or Medicare, you need to decide.\n\nThis is the second in a series of articles on understanding health insurance. Click here for all of the articles.\n\nWhat is open enrollment?\n\nOpen enrollment happens once each year. At this time, you can change insurance coverage. You might choose a different company. You might choose a different plan. You might change from individual to family coverage.\n\nDuring the rest of the year, you keep the same insurance coverage. Open enrollment offers a limited time to make changes.\n\nWho has open enrollment?\n\nMedicare, Medicaid, MNSure, on-the-job insurance \u2014 different rules apply, depending on what kind of health care coverage you have. Here\u2019s a basic explanation of the kinds of insurance. If you have one of the first three kinds of insurance, you have an open enrollment choice.\n\nInsurance through your employer \u2014 This is still the most common insurance. About 70 percent of Minnesotans under the age of 65 had employer-sponsored health insurance in 2011. Usually people with employer-sponsored health insurance pay part of the insurance cost. Private individual insurance \u2014 People who do not have employer-sponsored insurance may buy private insurance. They can buy directly from an insurance company. Or they can buy insurance through MNSure. Medicare \u2014 People who are 65 or older are covered by Medicare. They may choose Original Medicare or Medicare Advantage. They may also buy a Medicare prescription drug insurance policy. These are the most common Medicare decisions, but there are a few less common options, too. Medicaid and MinnesotaCare \u2014 If your income is low, you may qualify for Medicaid or MinnesotaCare.\n\nWhen is open enrollment?\n\nIf you have health insurance through your employer, Open Enrollment is the time when you can change from one health plan to another. Check with your employer for the dates.\n\nIf you have health insurance through MNSure, the Open Enrollment time is November 15, 2014 to February 15, 2015. During this time, you can switch from one insurance plan to another.\n\nIf you have Medicare, the open enrollment time is October 15-December 7. At this time, you can switch from Medicare Advantage to Original Medicare or from Original Medicare to Medicare Advantage. You can drop or add Medicare drug coverage. You can change from one Medicare drug plan to another.\n\nIf you have Medicaid or MinnesotaCare, you can enroll at any time in the year.\n\nWhat do you need to know?\n\nInsurance policies are complicated. And they change every year. Some of the things you need to look for are:\n\nCoverage \u2014 What does your insurance plan cover?\n\nPremiums \u2014 How much will you pay each month?\n\nDeductibles, co-payment and co-insurance \u2014 What amount of medical costs will your insurance pay, and what part will you pay?\n\nDoctors, clinics and hospitals \u2014 Which health care providers will your insurance company pay for?\n\nI\u2019ll write more about each of these questions in October and November.\n\nExceptions to the rule\n\nOpen enrollment time is a time when anyone can change insurance plans. Under the Affordable Care Act, Special Enrollment lets you make changes when your life changes. If you get married (or divorced), have a baby, move to a new state, lose a job, this is a \u201cqualifying life event.\u201d If one of these events happens, you can get a Special Enrollment time to change insurance coverage. For details on Special Enrollment in Minnesota, go to the MNsure website\n\nIt\u2019s tempting to ignore the open enrollment time and do nothing. If you do nothing, your insurance coverage through most plans (MNSure and most private and employer plans) will automatically renew. What\u2019s the catch?\n\nPremiums may go up, so you could pay more. Deductibles, co-pays and the rest of the terms could also change. If you get a subsidy through MNSure, that amount could change, too.\n\nBottom line: We all need to be vigilant health insurance consumers. Decision-making includes the cost of premiums, in-network and out-of-network providers, tiers of providers, tiers of drugs, co-insurance and more. I\u2019ll cover these topics in several \u201cexplainer\u201d articles about health insurance over the next couple of months.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Every year that annoying notice comes.
