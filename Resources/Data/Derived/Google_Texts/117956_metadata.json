Sasse aided firm implementing ACA\n\nNebraska Republican Ben Sasse has built his Senate campaign on his opposition to Obamacare \u2014 but he once consulted for a firm that was working to implement it.\n\nSasse provided early \u201cstrategic advice\u201d to former Health and Human Services Secretary Mike Leavitt\u2019s health care consulting firm while the firm pitched itself to clients in early 2010 to help implement the Affordable Care Act. Sasse is listed, along with his photograph and biography, as a \u201csenior advisor\u201d under the heading \u201cLeavitt Partners team\u201d in PowerPoint presentations from April and May 2010 in which Leavitt\u2019s firm sold its Obamacare expertise.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nTitled \u201cA Framework for Health Reform,\u201d the presentations sought to explain various aspects of the law. One page lists the \u201cfunding sources\u201d and \u201cbenefits\u201d of the Affordable Care Act. Other pages detail the \u201c10-year implementation process\u201d and describe \u201cstructural shifts\u201d in the health care industry as a result of the law.\n\n( POLITICO's full coverage of Obamacare)\n\nThe extent of Sasse\u2019s involvement with Leavitt Partners is unclear \u2014 both the Sasse campaign and Leavitt\u2019s firm insist he was never paid by the firm. But two former Leavitt managing directors recall appearing with him on company-sponsored panels. And a Leavitt official said the firm used the \u201csenior advisor\u201d designation \u201cvery loosely, but only in order to avoid confusion with our clients.\u201d\n\nSasse and Leavitt have until now denied the Senate candidate had any involvement in Leavitt Partners. Upon being presented with the company documents listing Sasse\u2019s name, the campaign and a spokesperson for Leavitt said Sasse was involved at the firm\u2019s outset.\n\n\u201cBen Sasse has been invited to dozens of health care conferences during his career. From what we can tell, he showed up at one of them and gave some free strategic advice on a health IT related project some years back,\u201d Sasse senior adviser Jordan Gehrke said.\n\nLeavitt spokeswoman Jordana Choucair initially said Sasse was never at the firm \u201cas either a paid or unpaid consultant, advisor or as an employee.\u201d In a subsequent email she reiterated that he was never paid by the firm but did provide assistance early on.\n\n\u201cDuring the early inception of LP, Ben did provide some unpaid advice on a health IT/wellness project,\u201d Choucair said.\n\n( PHOTOS: Senators up for election in 2014)\n\nSasse\u2019s connection with Leavitt\u2019s firm could undermine the first-time candidate\u2019s image as an outsider who is laser-focused on repealing Obamacare. Leavitt, a former Utah governor and confidant of Mitt Romney during the 2012 presidential race, briefly became a political problem for the campaign when conservatives said he couldn\u2019t be trusted because of his health care work.\n\nSasse \u2014 the president of Midland University, a small Lutheran school in Fremont, Neb., since Dec. 2010 \u2014 has made his opposition to the Affordable Care Act the driving theme of his campaign. He claims to have read the entire law and holds town hall meetings with a printed-out copy as a prop. Sasse also filmed a YouTube video in September saying it was time for \u201cevery Republican in Washington, starting with Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, to show some actual leadership\u201d to rescind the heath care law.\n\nSasse and former state Treasurer Shane Osborn are the front-runners in Nebraska\u2019s four-way GOP Senate primary to replace retiring GOP Sen. Mike Johanns. Whoever wins the May 13 primary is expected to coast to a general election victory in November.\n\nWith endorsements from the Club for Growth, Senate Conservatives Fund and Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), Sasse, 42, has presented himself as the insurgent candidate in the race. Sarah Palin endorsed him Thursday morning.\n\nOsborn, 39, a former Navy pilot, has backing from the conservative outside group FreedomWorks but is seen as the GOP establishment\u2019s first choice, largely due to his winning statewide election in 2006 and better name recognition.\n\n( PHOTOS: Kentucky Senate race: Mitch McConnell)\n\nOsborn also has connections that could prove troublesome in a GOP primary. Academy Securities, a financial planning firm for which Osborn is the chief marketing officer, was named by the Treasury Department in March 2013 to help manage the sale of the federal government\u2019s stock in General Motors as part of the disentanglement of federal assets under the Troubled Asset Relief Program.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "The Nebraska Senate candidate opposes ACA, but he consulted Leavitt Partners on enacting it.", "title": "Sasse aided firm implementing ACA", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/03/ben-sasse-nebraska-obamacare-affordable-care-act-104664.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/03/13/140313_ben_sasse_ap_605.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Obamacare,Elections,Senate,2014 Elections,ben sasse,Affordable Care Act,Nebraska", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "The Nebraska Senate candidate opposes ACA, but he consulted Leavitt Partners on enacting it.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1fce\"", "article_summary": "Sasse aided firm implementing ACANebraska Republican Ben Sasse has built his Senate campaign on his opposition to Obamacare \u2014 but he once consulted for a firm that was working to implement it.\n( POLITICO's full coverage of Obamacare)The extent of Sasse\u2019s involvement with Leavitt Partners is unclear \u2014 both the Sasse campaign and Leavitt\u2019s firm insist he was never paid by the firm.\nSasse provided early \u201cstrategic advice\u201d to former Health and Human Services Secretary Mike Leavitt\u2019s health care consulting firm while the firm pitched itself to clients in early 2010 to help implement the Affordable Care Act.\nOther pages detail the \u201c10-year implementation process\u201d and describe \u201cstructural shifts\u201d in the health care industry as a result of the law.\n( PHOTOS: Senators up for election in 2014)Sasse\u2019s connection with Leavitt\u2019s firm could undermine the first-time candidate\u2019s image as an outsider who is laser-focused on repealing Obamacare."}
