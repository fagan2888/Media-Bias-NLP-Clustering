As RevCycleIntelligence.com reported, this innovation may be a promising step toward rewarding value over volume and treating patients more like families during their healthcare decision-making endeavors. As CMS confirmed, such initiatives grant healthcare providers with an increased sense of flexibility with the bundling of conditions, developing the healthcare delivery structure, and considering payment allocation among healthcare providers.\n\n\u201cAlthough the Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement Model is distinct from the Bundled Payments for Care Improvement initiative, both initiatives are part of the innovative framework established by the Affordable Care Act to move our health care system toward one that rewards providers based on the quality, not quantity, of care they deliver to patients,\u201d confirms CMS in relation to its goal to tie 30 percent of Medicare payments to quality and value via alternative payment models by next year and 50 percent of payments within the next three years.", "article_metadata": {"description": "CMS announces a sizable shift to a risk-bearing implementation period where financial risk for episodes of care was assumed from a preparatory period.", "author": "RevCycleIntelligence", "og": {"url": "http://revcycleintelligence.com/news/cms-adds-pilot-project-participants-to-reduce-medicare-costs", "site_name": "RevCycleIntelligence", "image": "http://revcycleintelligence.com/images/site/articles/2015-08-12-data-cube.png", "type": "article", "title": "CMS Adds Pilot Project Participants to Reduce Medicare Costs"}, "twitter": {"description": "CMS announces a sizable shift to a risk-bearing implementation period where financial risk for episodes of care was assumed from a preparatory period.", "creator": "@RevCycleIntel", "image": {"src": "http://revcycleintelligence.com/images/site/articles/2015-08-12-data-cube.png"}, "title": "CMS Adds Pilot Project Participants to Reduce Medicare Costs", "site": "@RevCycleIntel", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfa62\"", "article_summary": "As CMS confirmed, such initiatives grant healthcare providers with an increased sense of flexibility with the bundling of conditions, developing the healthcare delivery structure, and considering payment allocation among healthcare providers.\n360 other organizations have agreed to participate in CMS\u2019s Bundled Payments for Care Improvement initiative (BPCI) where four episode-based payment models bundle payments for multiple services beneficiaries receive during a care episode.\nCMS is testing how bundled payments for clinical episodes help manifest more economically sound spending and advanced care via BPCI, which includes four models of bundled payments connected to inpatient hospital admission that vary according to provider type and post-hospitalization bundle length.\nAs RevCycleIntelligence.com reported, this innovation may be a promising step toward rewarding value over volume and treating patients more like families during their healthcare decision-making endeavors.\n1,755 providers have already partnered with those organizations."}
