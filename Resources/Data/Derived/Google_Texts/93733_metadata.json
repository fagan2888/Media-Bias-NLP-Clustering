And that meant I had to pay more for my insurance.\n\nMy rates kept going up until I couldn\u2019t pay for my insurance any longer. I sure tried \u2014 I cut back everything, but nothing made a difference. I had to cancel.\n\nIn a last-ditch effort, desperate to let someone know my plight, I wrote President Obama a letter straight from my heart. I shared my story with him and told him how much people like me needed his help. And he actually read it!\n\nA few months later, however, my fears came true. In March of 2010, I passed out at work, and found out soon after that I had a rare type of leukemia \u2014 acute lymphoblastic leukemia with the Philadelphia chromosome, to be specific.\n\nI went to the Cleveland Clinic and was placed in a great program on their leukemia floor, where I would fight for my life. While I was there, my sister Connie Anderson was asked to introduce the President at an event in Strongsville, Ohio.\n\nThen one day, the President sent me a note, then another \u2014 and even called me on the phone. I couldn\u2019t believe it. Connie and my brother Ken were able to go to the signing of the Affordable Care Act, and later I finally got to meet the President myself in Parma, Ohio.\n\nI really believe all of the excitement helped keep me alive. And today, I\u2019m happy to say that I\u2019m cancer-free.\n\nOf course, I can\u2019t begin to thank the President enough for the Affordable Care Act. During the fight to pass the law, he said that he carried my story with him every day, as a reminder of what the Act would mean for people all across our country. He later decided to frame the letter, which is now hanging up outside the Oval Office.\n\nAs the President has said, \u201cbecause of this law, there are other Americans \u2014 other sons and daughters, brothers and sisters, fathers and mothers \u2014 who will not have to hang their fortunes on chance. These are the Americans for whom we passed this law.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m so grateful to have a President who truly cares about the people that he serves.\n\nNatoma Canfield\n\nMedina, Ohio", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "blog.aids.gov \u2014 HIV Policy & Programs.
