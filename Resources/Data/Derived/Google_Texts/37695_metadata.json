Darwin earned their hatred because he explained the evolution of life in a way that doesn\u2019t require the hand of God. Darwin didn\u2019t exclude God, of course, though many creationists seem incapable of grasping this point. But he didn\u2019t require God, either, and that was enough to drive some people mad.\n\nDarwin also didn\u2019t have anything to say about how life got started in the first place \u2014 which still leaves a mighty big role for God to play, for those who are so inclined. But that could be about to change, and things could get a whole lot worse for creationists because of Jeremy England, a young MIT professor who\u2019s proposed a theory, based in thermodynamics, showing that the emergence of life was not accidental, but necessary. \u201c[U]nder certain conditions, matter inexorably acquires the key physical attribute associated with life,\u201d he was quoted as saying in an article in Quanta magazine early in 2014, that\u2019s since been republished by Scientific American and, more recently, by Business Insider. In essence, he\u2019s saying, life itself evolved out of simpler non-living systems.\n\nThe notion of an evolutionary process broader than life itself is not entirely new. Indeed, there\u2019s evidence, recounted by Eric Havelock in \u201cThe Liberal Temper in Greek Politics,\u201d that it was held by the pre-Socratic natural philosophers, who also first gave us the concept of the atom, among many other things. But unlike them or other earlier precursors, England has a specific, unifying, testable evolutionary mechanism in mind.\n\nQuanta fleshed things out a bit more like this:\n\nFrom the standpoint of physics, there is one essential difference between living things and inanimate clumps of carbon atoms: The former tend to be much better at capturing energy from their environment and dissipating that energy as heat. Jeremy England, a 31-year-old assistant professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has derived a mathematical formula that he believes explains this capacity. The formula, based on established physics, indicates that when a group of atoms is driven by an external source of energy (like the sun or chemical fuel) and surrounded by a heat bath (like the ocean or atmosphere), it will often gradually restructure itself in order to dissipate increasingly more energy. This could mean that under certain conditions, matter inexorably acquires the key physical attribute associated with life.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t mean we should expect life everywhere in the universe \u2014 lack of a decent atmosphere or being too far from the sun still makes most of our solar system inhospitable for life with or without England\u2019s perspective. But it does mean that \u201cunder certain conditions\u201d where life is possible \u2014 as it is here on Earth, obviously \u2014 it is also quite probable, if not, ultimately, inevitable. Indeed, life on Earth could well have developed multiple times independently of each other, or all at once, or both. The first truly living organism could have had hundreds, perhaps thousands of siblings, all born not from a single physical parent, but from a physical system, literally pregnant with the possibility of producing life. And similar multiple births of life could have happened repeatedly at different points in time.\n\nThat also means that Earth-like planets circling other suns would have a much higher likelihood of carrying life as well. We\u2019re fortunate to have substantial oceans as well as an atmosphere \u2014 the heat baths referred to above \u2014 but England\u2019s theory suggests we could get life with just one of them \u2014 and even with much smaller versions, given enough time. Giordano Bruno, who was burnt at the stake for heresy in 1600, was perhaps the first to take Copernicanism to its logical extension, speculating that stars were other suns, circled by other worlds, populated by beings like ourselves. His extreme minority view in his own time now looks better than ever, thanks to England.\n\nIf England\u2019s theory works out, it will obviously be an epochal scientific advance. But on a lighter note, it will also be a fitting rebuke to pseudo-scientific creationists, who have long mistakenly claimed that thermodynamics disproves evolution (here, for example), the exact opposite of what England\u2019s work is designed to show \u2014 that thermodynamics drives evolution, starting even before life itself first appears, with a physics-based logic that applies equally to living and non-living matter.\n\nMost important in this regard is the Second Law of Thermodynamics, which states that in any closed process, there is an increase in the total entropy (roughly speaking, a measure of disorder). The increase in disorder is the opposite of increasing order due to evolution, the creationists reason, ergo \u2014 a contradiction! Overlooking the crucial word \u201cclosed,\u201d of course. There are various equivalent ways of stating the law, one of which is that energy cannot pass from a cooler to a warmer body without extra work being done. Ginsberg\u2019s theorem (as in poet Allen Ginsberg) puts it like this: \u201cYou can\u2019t win. You can\u2019t break even. You can\u2019t even get out of the game.\u201d Although creationists have long mistakenly believed that evolution is a violation of the Second Law, actual scientists have not. For example, physicist Stephen G. Brush, writing for the American Physical Society in 2000, in \u201cCreationism Versus Physical Science,\u201d noted: \u201cAs Ludwig Boltzmann noted more than a century ago, thermodynamics correctly interpreted does not just allow Darwinian evolution, it favors it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A young MIT professor is finishing Darwin's task \u2014 and threatening to undo everything the wacky right holds dear", "title": "God is on the ropes: The brilliant new science that has creationists and the Christian right terrified", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "A young MIT professor is finishing Darwin's task \u2014 and threatening to undo everything the wacky right holds dear", "title": "God is on the ropes: The brilliant new science that has creationists and the Christian right terrified", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/01/03/god_is_on_the_ropes_the_brilliant_new_science_that_has_creationists_and_the_christian_right_terrified/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/10/darwin_church.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A young MIT professor is finishing Darwin's task \u2014 and threatening to undo everything the wacky right holds dear", "title": "God is on the ropes: The brilliant new science that has creationists and the Christian right terrified", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/10/darwin_church.jpg", "creator": "@PaulHRosenberg", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Paul Rosenberg", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Charles Darwin, Christian Right, Editor's Picks, Evolution, Jeremy England", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdac43\"", "article_summary": "Darwin earned their hatred because he explained the evolution of life in a way that doesn\u2019t require the hand of God.\nThe increase in disorder is the opposite of increasing order due to evolution, the creationists reason, ergo \u2014 a contradiction!\nDarwin didn\u2019t exclude God, of course, though many creationists seem incapable of grasping this point.\nBut he didn\u2019t require God, either, and that was enough to drive some people mad.\nThat also means that Earth-like planets circling other suns would have a much higher likelihood of carrying life as well."}
