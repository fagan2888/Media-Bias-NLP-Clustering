All donors, public, corporate and private need to have the information to judge whether their money is being properly spent.\u201d\n\nPhoto: Aliona Adrianova\n\nSir Stephen Bubb, chief executive of the Association of Chief Executives of Voluntary Organisations, said he would help the Government explore the idea, , as long as it did not impose onerous duties on charities.\n\nHe said: \u201cCharity leaders embrace the principles of transparency and welcome any opportunity to extend accountability.\n\n\u201cExisting legislation and regulation already deliver transparency but we would be glad to explore with Government any sustainable means of extending this.\n\n\u201cHowever, many charities could find the FOI Act a difficult and overwhelming obligation. Extending the Act is a blunderbuss approach which will divert resources from the front line.\n\nPhoto: REX FEATURES\n\n\u201cThe Government should consult with all charities large and small about the impact of such a move and come to conclusions post consultation.\n\n\u201cThe outcome of this might be a system which operates on a voluntary basis. But Government wants charities to maximise resources for the front line so adding a statutory bureaucratic burden hardly accords with that.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for the National Council for Voluntary Organisations said: \u201cWe've long called for more transparency in outsourced public services, whether they're run by businesses or charities, but there are more effective, efficient and proportionate ways to create it than by extending the FOI act.\n\n\u201cBusinesses and charities running public services should be required to collect the data necessary to monitor their performance, and it should be made accessible so they can be held accountable.\n\n\u201cThe Government's approach to opening up data on public service contracts is encouraging but there is still further to go.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "GSACategory": "newstopics", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03400/kids-company_3400403k.jpg"}, "site": "@Telegraph", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@christopherhope"}, "keywords": "kids company, FOI, freedom of informatoin, charity sector, chartiies, grants, government, Politics,News", "DCSext.cmsSect": "News;Politics;Christopher_Hope;Active", "DCSext.Channel": "news", "DCSext.MLC": "/news/politics", "DCSext.Content_Type": "Story", "news_keywords": "kids company, FOI, freedom of informatoin, charity sector, chartiies, grants, government", "WT.cg_n": "news", "title": "Members of the public to get powers to vet charity spending of public money", "section-id": 2303, "GSAGenre": "politics", "tmgads.pagetype": "Story", "DCSext.akamigeo": "US", "tmgads.section": "news-politics", "GSAMLC": "news/newstopics/politics", "GSAArticleType": "Story", "DCSext.pd": 1, "WT.cg_s": "politics", "description": "Ministers want to extend FOI powers to the charity sector to allow members of \n  the public to keep track of the way government grants are being spent.", "tmgads.channel": "news", "article-id": 12066568, "DCSext.Category": "politics", "DCSext.Level": 3, "DC.date.issued": "2015-12-25", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "GSASectionUniqueName": "news-news_topics-politics", "last-modified": "2015-12-25", "fb": {"admins": "686953094,531239902,100002344351237", "app_id": 120118784736295}, "article": {"publisher": 143666524748, "contenttype": "story", "section": "News", "wordcount": 683, "embedcount": 0, "authorName": "Christopher Hope", "tag": "Active", "subsection": "Politics", "videocount": 0, "internallinkcount": 0, "imagecount": 5, "externallinkcount": 0}, "DCSext.articleId": 12066568, "tmgads.articleid": 12066568, "tmgads.level": 3, "tmgads.geo": "US", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Members of the public to get powers to vet charity spending of public money \",\"link\": \"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/12066568/Members-of-the-public-to-get-powers-to-vet-charity-spending-of-public-money.html\",\"image_url\": \"http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03400/kids-company_3400403k.jpg\",\"type\": \"post\",\"post_id\": \"12066568\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-12-25T22:00:12Z\",\"section\": \"News\",\"authors\": [\"Christopher Hope\"],\"tags\": [\"Story\",\"News\",\"Politics\",\"Christopher Hope\",\"Active\"]}", "GSAChannel": "news", "GSAChannelName": "News", "og": {"site_name": "Telegraph.co.uk", "description": "Ministers want to extend FOI powers to the charity sector to allow members of   the public to keep track of the way government grants are being spent.", "title": "Members of the public to get powers to vet charity spending of public money", "url": "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/12066568/Members-of-the-public-to-get-powers-to-vet-charity-spending-of-public-money.html", "image": "http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03400/kids-company_3400403k.jpg", "type": "article"}, "DCSext.cf": 1, "tmgads.zone": "news.politics", "DCSext.author": "Christopher Hope", "DCSext.articleFirstPublished": "2015-12-25 14:29"}, "article_summary": "Ministers want to extend FOI powers to the charity sector to allow members of the public to keep track of the way government grants are being spent.\nAt present charities are exempted from FOI laws despite receiving tens of millions of pounds in grants from the Government.\n\u201cThe Government's approach to opening up data on public service contracts is encouraging but there is still further to go.\u201d\nMatthew Hancock, a Cabinet Office minister who is leading a review of FOI in Whitehall, is driving the changes to bring greater transparency to how public money is spent in the charitable sector.\nCharities that administer millions of pounds of public funds will be subject to Freedom of Information laws in wake of Kids Company collapse, under plans being developed by ministers."}
