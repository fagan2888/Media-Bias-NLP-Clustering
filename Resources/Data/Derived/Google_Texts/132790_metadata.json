(Mar 16, 2015) \u2013 Last Friday, the North Dakota House passed a measure that follows James Madison\u2019s advice to stop federal overreach. The vote was 61-30.\n\nIntroduced by State Rep. Robert Skarphol and ten cosponsors, House Concurrent Resolution (HCR3022) would create a mechanism in the state constitution \u201crestricting state and local government personnel and financial resources to purposes that are consistent with the Constitution of the United States.\u201d\n\nSimilar to Proposition 122 passed by voters in Arizona last November, HCR3022 would ban the state of North Dakota and all political subdivisions \u201cfrom using any personnel or financial resources to enforce, administer, or cooperate with [a] designated federal action\u201d that is deemed unconstitutional through \u201cpassage of an initiative or referendum pursuant to section 1 of article III [of the state constitution]; a law enacted by the legislative assembly; or pursuing any other available legal remedy.\u201d\n\nAlready being used by the Arizona legislature as a tool to help block enforcement of Obamacare, federal gun control, unilateral executive orders from the President, and more, passage of HCR3022 could be a game-changer for North Dakota as well.\n\nTHEY NEED HELP\n\nWhile the federal politicians and bureaucrats would like you to believe that the federal government is all-powerful and will do what it wants, when it wants, this couldn\u2019t be further from the truth.\n\nThe Secret Service wasn\u2019t able to carry out a warrantless raid in Tennessee without help from local police. In fact, they were so desperate for help from the state, they were \u201cfrantic.\u201d\n\nA vast majority of raids carried out by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) only occur with significant assistance from state or local resources. The Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) barely has the resources to shut down just a fraction of marijuana businesses in just one city out of the 20+ states rejecting the unconstitutional federal prohibition on that plant.\n\nWhen the NSA builds a new facility to house all your private communications, it relies on things like water or electricity provided by state or local agencies, or it won\u2019t have the resources to stay open.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act is already being crippled by states that have refused to implement parts of the federal program, and further state resistance is likely to bring the entire Act down.\n\nThe National Park Service can\u2019t shut down a park without help from states, and the FBI\u2019s facial recognition program won\u2019t go anywhere without images supplied by state Departments of Motor Vehicles.\n\nDuring the partial federal \u201cshutdown\u201d of 2013, National Association of Governors admitted, \u201cStates are partners with the federal government in implementing most federal programs.\u201d\n\nPartnerships rarely work when only half the partners are involved.\n\nLEGAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL\n\nHCR3022 is consistent with the advice of James Madison, who advised a \u201crefusal to cooperate with officers of the Union\u201d in Federalist #46 as an effective method to stop federal power.\n\nMadison\u2019s advice, and the language of HCR3022 both mirror the well-established legal doctrine of anti-commandeering. The Supreme Court has consistently held that the federal government cannot force states to help implement or enforce and federal act or program.It rests primarily on four SCOTUS cases \u2013 Prigg v. Pennsylvania (1842), New York v. US (1992), Printz v. US (1997) and National Federation of Businesses v. Sebelius (2012).\n\nThe Printz case serves as the modern cornerstone. In it, Justice Scalia held:\n\nThe Federal Government may neither issue directives requiring the States to address particular problems, nor command the States\u2019 officers, or those of their political subdivisions, to administer or enforce a federal regulatory program.\n\nAs noted Georgetown Law Constitutional Scholar Randy Barnett has said, \u201cThis line of cases is \u2026 considered well settled.\u201d\n\nNEXT UP\n\nAfter passing the House, HCR3022 now moves to the Senate Judiciary Committee, where a public hearing will be held in the near future. Should the committee pass the resolution, it will move to the full Senate for concurrence. Passage in both houses will send HCR3022 to a vote of the People at the general election in 2016, bypassing the Governor\u2019s desk.\n\nSupporters are strongly urged to contact all members of the Senate committee, requesting a YES vote on HCR3022.
