Ron Paul, looking for some help, but got nothing but a remark from Paul that he would eliminate five agencies. \"Oh five,\" Perry said. \"So Commerce, Education, and, uh, the uh, um, um.\" \"EPA?\" offered former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney. \"EPA, there ya go,\" Perry said as the room exploded in laughter. CNBC moderator John Harwood honed in and pressed Perry: \"Seriously? Is EPA the one you were talking about?\" \"No sir.
