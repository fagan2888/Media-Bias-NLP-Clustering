(Official White House Photo by Pete Souza)\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, President Obama and the First Lady met with a group of moms (and one aunt!) in the Oval Office to talk about how health reform has benefitted their families. They talked about the critical role that moms are playing in helping their families access quality, affordable health care by encouraging their adult children, family members and their peers to sign up for coverage.\n\nBecause many women in the group know first-hand why having the security of health insurance is so important, they\u2019ve been working tirelessly to make sure that everybody in America is able to get high-quality health care coverage that provides them with financial protection and looks after them when they get sick.\n\n\u201cI think this conversation really drove home in a very personal way why this is important,\u201d President Obama said. \u201cSometimes here in Washington, this is a very abstract conversation or an entirely political conversation. But when you boil it down to stories and people hear what it means to have the security of solid health insurance at an affordable price when you need it, it reminds me at least of why we've been fighting so hard to get this done.\u201d\n\nFirst Lady Michelle Obama said that she\u2019s involved with this issue \u201cbecause I\u2019m a mom.\u201d\n\n\u2026It\u2019s our job as mothers to make sure that our young people are informed about their \u201cinvincibility,\u201d to make sure that other moms and families out there really understand what this law provides and that they can take advantage of it. This is the beauty of it. People have choices. They can go on to the website; they can talk to a navigator; they can learn for themselves what the law means and what it doesn\u2019t mean. And that's really, really what we want people to do, is educate yourselves. Get that education. Make the choice that's best for your family, because the options are there.\n\nThe First Lady thanked everyone for their hard work getting the word out.\n\n\u201cWe urge everyone out there who has a story to share it,\u201d she said \u201cAnd we urge people to reach out. And if they\u2019ve signed up their child, then sign up their friends. If you\u2019ve got grandkids, make it a Christmas treat around the table to talk about a little health care. Ring in the New Year with new coverage.\u201c\n\nFor more information:", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/profiles/forall/themes/custom/fortyfour/browserconfig.xml", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "application-name": "Whitehouse", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/profiles/forall/themes/custom/fortyfour/images/fortyfour/favicons/mstile-310x150.png", "twitter": {"title": "The Affordable Care Act Means Peace of Mind for Moms", "url": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2013/12/19/affordable-care-act-means-peace-mind-moms", "image": {"src": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/images/twitter_cards_blog.jpg", "height": 240, "width": 240}, "creator": "@WhiteHouse", "site": "@WhiteHouse", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#003C80", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/profiles/forall/themes/custom/fortyfour/images/fortyfour/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/profiles/forall/themes/custom/fortyfour/images/fortyfour/favicons/mstile-310x310.png", "og": {"site_name": "whitehouse.gov", "description": "President Obama and the First Lady meet with a group of moms (and one aunt) in the Oval Office to talk about how health reform has benefitted their families.", "title": "The Affordable Care Act Means Peace of Mind for Moms", "url": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2013/12/19/affordable-care-act-means-peace-mind-moms", "image": {"width": 240, "secure_url": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/images/twitter_cards_blog.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "identifier": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/images/twitter_cards_blog.jpg", "height": 240}, "updated_time": "2015-08-12T19:02:18-04:00", "type": "article"}, "MobileOptimized": "width", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/profiles/forall/themes/custom/fortyfour/images/fortyfour/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "article": {"published_time": "2013-12-19T13:31:42-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-12T19:02:18-04:00"}, "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/profiles/forall/themes/custom/fortyfour/images/fortyfour/favicons/mstile-150x150.png", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcac2e\"", "article_summary": "And that's really, really what we want people to do, is educate yourselves.\nPresident Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama meet with mothers regarding the Affordable Care Act in the Oval Office, Dec. 18, 2013.\nIf you\u2019ve got grandkids, make it a Christmas treat around the table to talk about a little health care.\n(Official White House Photo by Pete Souza)On Wednesday afternoon, President Obama and the First Lady met with a group of moms (and one aunt!)\n\u201cI think this conversation really drove home in a very personal way why this is important,\u201d President Obama said."}
