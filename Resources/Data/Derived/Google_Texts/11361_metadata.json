While prices are generally better in Arizona, they can vary widely across the state: \u2022 Apache: $300\n\n\u2022 Coconino: $300\n\n\u2022 Navajo: $300\n\n\u2022 Mohave: $295\n\n\u2022 Yavapai: $295\n\n\u2022 La Paz: $263\n\n\u2022 Yuma: $263\n\n\u2022 Gila: $258\n\n\u2022 Cochise: $254\n\n\u2022 Graham: $254\n\n\u2022 Greenlee: $254\n\n\u2022 Pinal: $224\n\n\u2022 Pima: $179\n\n\u2022 Santa Cruz: $179\n\n\u2022 Maricopa: $177 Data: Kaiser Family Foundation See related story: 'Obamacare' enrollment tops 204,000 in Arizona, 11.4 million nationally\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Arizona residents can expect to pay some of the lowest premiums in the nation under Obamacare, but the cost will vary widely within the state depending on where people live.\n\nA 40-year-old buying the second-lowest silver plan available on the federal marketplace could expect to pay about $178 if he or she lived in Maricopa, Pima or Santa Cruz counties \u2013 well below the national average of $280 a month.\n\nBut the same plan would cost the same person as much as $300 a month before financial assistance if he or she lived in one of the state\u2019s more rural counties, according to data provided by the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nAs of last week, 180,113 Arizonans had signed up for insurance through the federal marketplace during the second year of enrollment under the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare.\n\nSunday is the deadline to enroll for 2015 coverage. Those who are uninsured come Monday will be fined $325 or 2 percent of their household income \u2013 whichever is higher.\n\nMost of those enrollments so far have come where most of the people live, with 68 percent coming from the Phoenix region and 15 percent from Tucson, according to data from the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nThose are also the areas with some of the lowest monthly premiums, which experts attribute to competition among the many insurance companies and health providers in those markets.\n\nMore providers give insurance companies an opportunity to negotiate better deals, said Allen Gjersvig, healthcare innovation director of the Arizona Alliance for Community Health Centers.\n\n\u201cPricing in a geographical area has much to do with the number of providers and the willingness of the providers to negotiate with the insurance companies,\u201d Gjersvig said.\n\nArizona also has 13 insurance providers that offer plans through the federal marketplace, twice the national average of six or seven per state.\n\n\u201cArizona is somewhat unique in that it has a lot of insurers participating in the market,\u201d said Cynthia Cox, senior policy analyst at the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nBut not all of those insurers offer plans in every county in the state.\n\n\u201cThere are a smaller number of insurance companies offering plans \u2026 a smaller number of plans, if you will, in the rural areas,\u201d Gjersvig said.\n\nAnd things didn\u2019t get any easier for people in rural Arizona looking to enroll for health care this year.\n\nA Kaiser Family Foundation analysis found that while monthly costs in Maricopa and Santa Cruz counties dropped by 10 percent or more from 2014 to 2015, premiums in Mohave, Yavapai, Coconino, Navajo, Apache and Pinal counties grew more than 10 percent.\n\nThose premium rates do not account for income-based tax credits that health insurance clients can receive if they are enrolled through the federal marketplace.\n\nAbout 76 percent of those enrolled in Arizona qualify for tax credits. That is lower than the national average of 87 percent, but Cheryl O\u2019Donnell of Enroll America said that could be driven by Arizona\u2019s rates, which are already well below the rest of the country.\n\n\u201cThe fact that we have the lowest-cost plans in Phoenix \u2013 that\u2019s still 8 out of 10 people that are still getting something to help cover their premiums,\u201d said O\u2019Donnell, the state director for Enroll America.\n\nAs people make final decisions on an insurance plan in advance of Sunday\u2019s deadline, Cox said it\u2019s important for them to focus not only on the monthly cost but also the cost of co-pay and deductibles.\n\n\u201cYou want to consider both,\u201d she said. \u201cIt needs to be affordable on a monthly basis and also affordable, or as affordable as you can get it to be, for if you actually need a lot of health care.\u201d\n\nCox cautioned that consumers should choose a plan they know will fit their budget for the long haul, because after Sunday they will be stuck with that plan for the remainder of the year, absent a qualifying life event like a birth or marriage.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to sign up for a plan with monthly payments that you can\u2019t afford because if you get to a place in the middle of the year where you feel like you just can\u2019t afford your insurance anymore, you don\u2019t have any other option to switch plans or drop out of this coverage and sign up for something else,\u201d Cox said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "index.html", "image": "http://cronkitenews.asu.edu/assets/images/15/02/13-healthy-mapwide-lead.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Arizona residents can expect to pay some of the lowest premiums in the nation under Obamacare, but the cost will vary widely within the state depending on where people live.
