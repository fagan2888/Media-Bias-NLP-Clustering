"article_text": "Just six people managed enroll in new health plans on day one of the website\u2019s troubled rollout, documents released by Republican lawmakers showed, in a new embarrassment for the White House.\n\nHouse Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Darrell Issa released a document from a meeting on Oct. 2, the day after HealthCare.gov went online, recording the paltry figure.\n\nBy the end of that day, two full days into the sign-up process, \u201cthere were 248 enrollments\u201d nationwide, according to the notes from the Department of Health and Social Security.\n\nBoth documents were posted Thursday on the website run by Issa\u2019s House oversight committee.\n\nPresident Barack Obama is counting on millions signing up for health care through online exchanges, part of a plan he pushed through in 2010 to help uninsured Americans get coverage.\n\nRepublican lawmakers are uniformly opposed to the law, which they have nicknamed \u201cObamacare,\u201d and seized on the poor enrollment figures as sign of a colossal failure of the website, in particular.\n\nBut Obama spokesman Jay Carney dismissed the focus on the six enrollees as a \u201cdog-bites-man story.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe knew it was going to be a slow build,\u201d Carney told reporters.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no question that it\u2019s been made more challenging by the poorly functioning website, and that\u2019s on us and that\u2019s why we\u2019re dedicating the resources and the brainpower to get it fixed.\u201d\n\nHealth Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, who testified before a House panel Wednesday, would not provide the number of enrollees to date, saying that figure would be released mid-November.\n\nIssa announced he subpoenaed Sebelius to provide additional documents about the website, saying the fixes to date have been \u201ccompletely unacceptable.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Just six people managed enroll in new health plans on day
