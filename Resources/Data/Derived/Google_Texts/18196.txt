Clinton Discusses Addiction Problem in America

(Published Sunday, April 24, 2016)

She talked to the crowd about creating jobs, equal pay for women and raising the minimum wage.

"I support the fight for fifteen. I support raising the minimum wage at the federal level because I want people who are working hard full time to feel like they have a pathway out of poverty," Clinton said.

Speaking at the University of Bridgeport, she talked about making college more affordable and allowing graduates to refinance their student loan debt.

On the subject of health care, Clinton promised to fight any efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, but she also said there should be a focus on dealing with mental health issues and addiction.

"First of all, we have to save lives, that's number one. But number two, we've got to get beyond this terrible epidemic of addiction that is taking the lives of so many Americans," she said.

The former secretary of state said she would take on the gun lobby and the epidemic of gun violence in America. It was the same theme she discussed at an event in Hartford last Thursday.
