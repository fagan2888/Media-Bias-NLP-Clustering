His \"iron seven\".\n\n\"Our kids were really, really courageous. Of the eight wins in this non-conference, this is the one I'm most proud of because we faced so much adversity,\" he said of his seven available players. \"We're playing with no true point guard. The iron seven were really, really good today and they played a lot minutes, made a lot of big plays when they were really tired. This is a really nice win.\"\n\nCSU (8-3) was without its leading scorer and senior leader Gritt Ryder \u2014 who was out with a hamstring injury sustained in the team's previous game against Florida Atlantic \u2014 to go along with point guard AJ Newton (knee), forward Victoria Wells (concussion) and forward Emillie Hesseldal (elbow).\n\nThe Rams were even desperate enough to go to the volleyball team for a body, adding walk on Kaitlind Bestgen as an emergency player despite the fact she didn't even play high school basketball.\n\nCal Poly (4-7) pushed the banged up Rams to the limit, especially down the final 6 minutes of the game when the Mustangs out-scored them 20-10. Yet with CSU clinging onto a slim 60-59 advantage, the Rams came away with three big stops and some clutch free throw shooting to gain breathing room.\n\nA turnover in the final 20 seconds by the Rams set up Cal Poly with a golden opportunity down two points to send the game to overtime or potentially win with a 3-pointer, which it had already drained nine of.\n\nOnce more Williams' iron seven got the job done as junior Hanne Mestdagh locked down Mustang guard Ariana Elegado (who scored a team-best 14 points, including 4-of-10 on 3's), forcing a turnover and sealing the victory for CSU.\n\n\"I thought that last possession Hanne was brilliant on the ball. Elegado was really trying to shake Hanne and Hanne just sat in that stance and got a deflection,\" Williams said. \"That was the play of the game right there.\"\n\nWith so few players available, the Rams were forced to take on some roles they weren't used to, no more so than sophomore guard Ellen Nystrom. Nystrom was CSU's defacto point and filled the role nicely, finishing with 13 assists.\n\n\"I like it, it's fun. We need players to play different positions because we have two of our starting point guards out,\" she said. \"I just stepped up and took the challenge.\"\n\nEssentially CSU's bench amounted to one player, junior Alana Arias, placing extra weight on the shoulders of a player who's been gaining confidence as the season's progressed.\n\nArias pulled her own by dropping a team-best 17 points as well as four rebounds, three steals and a block. Not to mention the free throw line where she nailed 5-of-7.\n\n\"Honestly, to me, I don't care if I start or not. To me it matters to me the most if I finish the game,\" the Porto Alegre, Brazil native said. \"I feel better playing, I feel more comfortable. I came in with the same mentality of the last game, just being aggressive on the offense and looking to score.\"\n\nCSU and Cal Poly played nearly even in every way, each shooting 24-of-56 (42 percent) and turning the ball over 16 times. But Williams told his players they needed only to win a half and play tie basketball the rest of the way, which they did, sending Williams into the break full of holiday cheer.\n\n\"Merry Christmas, this was a good win. It's always nice to go into Christmas break with a victory. Just ask my wife,\" he joked. \"I won't be the Grinch this year.\"\n\nCris Tiller: 970-669-5050 ext. 511, tillerc@reporter-herald.com or twitter.com/cristiller\n\nRams 65, Mustangs 63\n\nAt Moby Arena\n\nCAL POLY (4-7)\n\nAriana Elegado 50-0 14, Hannah Gilbert 52-2 12, Beth Balbierz 3 3-3 10, Kristen Ale 3 0-0 7, Rachel Koehler 3 0-0 6, Lynn Leaupepe 20-0 5, Lisa Marie Sanchez 1 0-0 3, Dynn Leaupepe 1 0-0 3, Mary Kate Evans 1 0-0 2, Sarah Lipton 0 1-2 1.
