He noted that both states are \u201cred,\u201d and he said Democrats did well in \u201cblue\u201d states such as New Jersey and Pennsylvania, where Democrats captured all three seats up for grabs on the state Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d be reluctant to draw significant conclusions\u201d from Tuesday\u2019s results, Mr. Earnest said.\n\nIn Kentucky, where Republican businessman Matt Bevin defeated Democratic Attorney General Jack Conway in the race for governor, Mr. Earnest said Obamacare was not to blame. Mr. Bevin has vowed to roll back health benefits under the federal law, saying it has led to a \u201cfinancial debacle\u201d in the state.\n\nMr. Earnest said Mr. Bevin stated only days ago that \u201cnobody\u2019s losing anything\u201d under the state\u2019s Medicaid expansion.\n\n\u201cVowing to repeal the Affordable Care Act in some cases has been used as an effective political strategy, but it\u2019s not a terribly effective governing strategy,\u201d Mr. Earnest said.\n\nNationwide, prior to Tuesday\u2019s balloting, Democrats had lost 910 seats in statehouses nationwide since Mr. Obama took office in 2009. Republicans currently control 56 percent of all state legislative seats.\n\nMr. Earnest said that\u2019s not the president\u2019s fault, adding, \u201cObviously the president would like to see Democrats do better.\u201d\n\nHe said there are \u201ca variety of explanations\u201d for Republicans\u2019 success in states elections under Mr. Obama, including GOP-controlled redistricting, the tendency of Democrat to live in big cities, and the success of Republicans in get-out-the-vote campaigns.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republican victories in Tuesday's elections shouldn't be blamed on President Obama or Obamacare, the White House said Wednesday.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Republican victories in Tuesday\u2019s elections shouldn\u2019t be blamed on President Obama or Obamacare, the White House said Wednesday.", "title": "Obama not to blame for GOP victories, White House says", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/nov/4/obama-not-blame-gop-victories-white-house-says/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/11/04/AP_727986826747.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/11/04/AP_727986826747.jpg", "description": "Republican victories in Tuesday's elections shouldn't be blamed on President Obama or Obamacare, the White House said Wednesday.", "card": "summary", "title": "Obama not to blame for GOP victories, White House says"}, "Author": "Dave Boyer", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Josh Earnest, Republican Party"}, "article_summary": "Republican victories in Tuesday\u2019s elections shouldn\u2019t be blamed on President Obama or Obamacare, the White House said Wednesday.\nNationwide, prior to Tuesday\u2019s balloting, Democrats had lost 910 seats in statehouses nationwide since Mr. Obama took office in 2009.\nWhite House press secretary Josh Earnest tried on Wednesday to explain those election results, which included GOP victories in the only gubernatorial contests in the nation, in Kentucky and Mississippi.\nMr. Bevin has vowed to roll back health benefits under the federal law, saying it has led to a \u201cfinancial debacle\u201d in the state.\nEarnest said Mr. Bevin stated only days ago that \u201cnobody\u2019s losing anything\u201d under the state\u2019s Medicaid expansion."}
