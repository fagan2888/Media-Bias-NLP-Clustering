Because she is a former prosecutor, Bondi\u2019s addresses are exempt from public disclosure.\n\nA state ethics law now requires such yearly financial disclosures, but Bondi\u2019s filing is an example of the problem it creates, said Darryl Paulson, professor emeritus of government at the University of South Florida St. Petersburg.\n\nThe relative imprecision of the form was meant to protect elected officials, their families and business partners from revealing too much personal information.\n\nBut it raises questions when officials show they have become wealthier over their time in public office without offering many details.\n\nBondi, through a spokeswoman, declined to comment about her finances beyond her filed disclosures.\n\n\u201cIf there were more specific disclosure requirements, it might be very easy to explain away why their wealth has increased,\u201d Paulson said. \u201cGiven that you have such broad categories, it becomes impossible for almost anybody to piece together where assets are coming from.\n\n\u201cIt leads, naturally, to a suspicion on the part of the electorate that there\u2019s something wrong with the process, that (officials) are taking advantage of their office,\u201d he added. \u201cThat may not be the case, but we just don\u2019t know, because there\u2019s not enough information there on where money\u2019s really coming from.\u201d\n\nThat said, some elected officials go beyond the minimum requirements of the disclosure form.\n\nSeveral state lawmakers, for example, attach detailed appendices, financial schedules \u2014 even federal tax returns.\n\nBondi apparently benefited from the rebound in the housing market, listing the value of her South Tampa home at $720,000, up from $665,000 last year \u2014 a $55,000 increase.\n\nAnd Bondi continues to decrease her reported liabilities, or what she owes. Her debts went down from $312,655 to $290,426, a more than $22,000 drop.\n\nAt the same time, her worth is growing from an increase in her unitemized \u201chousehold goods and personal effects,\u201d her disclosure shows. The state allows this category to be reported as a lump sum if the components exceed $1,000.\n\nThe financial disclosure form defines such goods and effects as including, but not limited to, \u201cjewelry, collections of stamps, guns and numismatic items (coins), art objects, household equipment and furnishings, clothing, other household items\u201d and personal vehicles.\n\nThat line item went from $424,838 in 2012 to $505,328 last year, an almost 20 percent hike.\n\nAs before, Bondi continues to list her $128,000 state salary as attorney general.\n\nAll of Florida\u2019s statewide elected officials were worth more than they were the year before, according to disclosure reports.\n\nGov. Rick Scott\u2019s net worth went from nearly $83.8 million at the end of 2012 to $132.5 million at the end of last year.\n\nHe was head of a major hospital chain and a venture capitalist before his 2010 election.\n\nScott, running for re-election, is the only statewide official who keeps his investments in a blind trust.\n\nAgriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam, whose family owns Putnam Groves in Bartow, saw his net worth increase from $7.23 million in 2012 to $7.85 million in 2013, records show.\n\nAnd Chief Financial Officer Jeff Atwater\u2019s net worth went from $1.74 million in 2012 to $1.86 million last year.\n\nBondi, also running for re-election this November, will face one of two Democratic candidates \u2014 George Sheldon or Perry Thurston \u2014 and Libertarian Bill Wohlsifer in the general election.\n\nSheldon, a former state and federal administration official, listed his net worth as $185,865 in campaign filings. He is the only challenger in the race to attach his 2013 federal tax return.\n\nThurston, the outgoing Democratic leader of the Florida House of Representatives, listed his worth at $325,900. When listing properties he owns as assets, he also gives their street addresses.\n\nWohlsifer, a Tallahassee attorney, declared his worth at $786,805. Details on his disclosure include his ownership of \u201ctwo gravesites and one tombstone\u201d in the city\u2019s Oakland Cemetery.\n\njrosica@tampatrib.com\n\n(850) 765-0807\n\nTwitter: @jlrosicaTBO", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sun, 27 Jul 2014 01:00:00 -0400", "Description": "Attorney General Pam Bondi has surpassed the seven-figure mark in her personal wealth, according to her most recent financial disclosure report.", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "Attorney General Pam Bondi has surpassed the seven-figure mark in her personal wealth, according to her most recent financial disclosure report.", "title": "Bondi now in millionaire\u2019s club", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/news/politics/bondis-net-worth-continues-to-rise-while-in-office-20140727/", "image": {"width": 1978, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140727/ARTICLE/140729394/AR/0/AR-140729394.jpg", "height": 2000}, "updated_time": "2014-07-27T14:59:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "Attorney General Pam Bondi has surpassed the seven-figure mark in her personal wealth, according to her most recent financial disclosure report.", "title": "Bondi now in millionaire\u2019s club", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140727/ARTICLE/140729394/AR/0/AR-140729394.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2014-07-27T01:00:00Z-04", "modified_time": "2014-07-27T14:59:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcf9d\"", "article_summary": "Her reported worth was $472,260 when she first ran for office, meaning her net worth over her first term has almost tripled.\nAttorney General Pam Bondi has surpassed the seven-figure mark in her personal wealth, according to her most recent financial disclosure report.\nBondi, a Hillsborough County prosecutor before her 2010 election, declared her net worth at the end of 2013 at almost $1.24 million \u2014 a nearly 60 percent jump from her 2012 net worth of $780,871.\nAnd Chief Financial Officer Jeff Atwater\u2019s net worth went from $1.74 million in 2012 to $1.86 million last year.\nRick Scott\u2019s net worth went from nearly $83.8 million at the end of 2012 to $132.5 million at the end of last year."}
