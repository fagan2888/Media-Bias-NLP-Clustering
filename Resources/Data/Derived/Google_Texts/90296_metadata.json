And, I\u2019m glad this is the guy who did it.\n\nMike Collins is one of several Republicans vying for Rep. Paul Broun\u2019s seat in Georgia, and he owns a trucking company. Cue the Enya:\n\nThe voiceover refers to the pressures put on small business by ObamaCare:\n\n\u201cWhat you see is a small businessman, confronted with Obamacare, a disastrous government plan,\u201d Collins, who owns a trucking business in the state, says in the video.\n\nEmily Zanotti briefs us on Collins, who has some practice ahead of him to do the truly epic splits:\n\nHis campaign slogan is \u201cOverhaul DC,\u201d apparently in reference to his successful trucking business (over-hauling, har har), but Mike Collins has mostly been running on boyish good looks, his inexplicable hair, his affinity for high-waisted jeans, and his father\u2019s legacy thus far (the Plan of Overhaul has yet to be unveiled, possibly, based on the following, because it\u2019s so awesome, he can\u2019t even tell you about it).\n\nHis father is former Rep. Mac Collins. I must say I would have appreciated a \u201cthis is a stretch for small business\u201d pun, but overall I am pleased with this.\n\nMeanwhile, on the other side of the aisle, candidates would prefer karoaokeing Enya if it meant they didn\u2019t have to talk about Obamacare:\n\nEarlier this week I noted that the words \u201cAffordable Care Act\u201d and/or \u201cObamacare\u201d do not appear on the DCCC\u2019s home page. Their spokesmen insisted that a section labeled \u201cGOP Hypocrites\u201d counts, although even on that link, there\u2019s no mention of the president\u2019s signature domestic legislation; it\u2019s merely an attack that \u201cRepublicans are so intent upon taking away your health care that they shut down the government over it.\u201d (Conflating Obamacare with \u201cyour health care\u201d is the point, obviously.) If you look at the individual campaign websites of the Jumpstart Candidates, you find that references to \u201cAffordable Care Act\u201d and/or \u201cObamacare\u201d are few and far between. In fact, most of the campaign sites don\u2019t even mention health care at all.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Stretch.", "title": "Georgia Congressional candidate spoofs Van Damme to bash ObamaCare", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2013/12/05/georgia-congressional-candidate-spoofs-van-damme-to-bash-obamacare/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "keywords": "campaign ads, Georgia, Mike Collins, Paul Broun, Van Damme,", "article": {"published_time": "2013-12-06T02:21:35+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-12-06T02:18:34+00:00"}, "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd085e\"", "article_summary": "Georgia Congressional candidate spoofs Van Damme to bash ObamaCareposted at 9:21 pm on December 5, 2013 by Mary Katharine HamIt was inevitable.\nI must say I would have appreciated a \u201cthis is a stretch for small business\u201d pun, but overall I am pleased with this.\nIn fact, most of the campaign sites don\u2019t even mention health care at all.\nMike Collins is one of several Republicans vying for Rep.
