That audit warned that the Partnership Contracts for Health (PCH) program \u201chad little oversight, weak internal controls and no real auditing system, which put millions of tax dollars at risk.\u201d\n\nUSAID officials, for their part, said they plan to address publicly the details of the report during a briefing in Kabul later today.\n\nRELATED: WHY WE\u2019RE STILL WASTING BILLIONS IN AFGHANISTAN\n\nThe 2012 audit found that program directors were paid in cash, with no documented policies or procedural manuals in place. It also found that no one was performing external audits and that the \u201cinternal audit team didn\u2019t have relevant professional qualifications.\u201d There was also \u2013 shockingly \u2013 no budget committee to decide how to disperse the funds.\n\nYet USAID continues to fund the program. By mid-June of this year it had promised about $190 million to Partnership Contracts for Health. SIGAR found that about $127 million had been spent \u2013 so there\u2019s $63 million left to be disbursed this year.\n\nIn its report, SIGAR recommends that the USAID mission director stop further funding of the program until all cost estimates are validated and a plan is developed to address the deficiencies. The auditor suggested \u201creturning the excess obligations to the U.S. Treasury for better use.\u201d\n\nBut USAID didn\u2019t concur with SIGAR\u2019s recommendation and said they had \u201cno obligation to address the deficiencies identified or to verify any corrective actions\u201d that were implemented for the program.\n\n\u201cUSAID\u2019s decision to continue disbursing funds \u2026 with little to no assurance that these funds are safeguarded from waste, fraud and abuse raises serious concerns about the integrity of the [Afghan Ministry of Public Health] program,\u201d the report said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The Special Inspector General for Afghan Reconstruction (SIGAR) released a report today warning that the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) is still allocating $236 million a year to the Afghan Ministry of Public Health.
