Jeb Bush on Friday fondly recalled campaigning here with his father but said he would work to differentiate himself from both former President George H.W. Bush as well as his brother, former President George W. Bush.\n\n\u201cThere are people including myself that love my brother, love my dad, but I\u2019m going to have to get this on my own,\u201d Bush told reporters after speaking at a fundraiser for Rep. David Young, an Iowa Republican.\n\nSpeaking to about 100 people at a dessert reception, Bush said he had stumped across the state on behalf of his father, and indicated he would run similarly hard if \u2014 as widely expected \u2014 he seeks the White House himself.\n\n\u201cI just love this state. I really had a good time, and my dad won, which was a spectacular experience,\u201d Bush said. \u201cI\u2019ve done it both ways. I\u2019ve been to Iowa where my dad lost, and I\u2019ve been there when he won. I like the winning part better, to be honest with you.\u201d\n\n(The elder Bush won the Iowa caucuses in 1980 but not the nomination; he finished third in the caucuses in 1988 but won the nomination that year, and ultimately the White House. George W. Bush won the caucuses in both years he was elected, 2000 and 2004.)\n\nThe appearance was Bush\u2019s first foray into the state that will hold the first presidential nominating contest early next year. Over the course of a two-day swing, he will court GOP activists and greet voters--and try to allay concerns by conservatives here that he is not one of them.\n\nTo make that case, Bush touted his tenure as governor of Florida, repeatedly saying he was a conservative who cut taxes, slimmed the state workforce, presided over the creation of 1.3 million jobs, eliminated affirmative action and improved the state\u2019s schools.\n\n\u201cI have a record I think people might be interested in learning about,\u201d Bush said.\n\nOn Saturday, Bush and nearly a dozen other potential White House candidates will speak at an agriculture forum at the state fairgrounds in Des Moines. He will also address supporters privately at a barbecue restaurant in Waukee and meet diners at a Pizza Ranch in Cedar Rapids.\n\nBush is considered a national front-runner because of his fundraising prowess, but faces skepticism among conservative Republicans in part because of his support for a set of national education standards known as Common Core. Tellingly, that was the subject of the first question he received Friday from a member of the audience.\n\nBush stuck by his position, but emphasized that he believed education decisions had to be made at the state and local levels.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m for is higher standards, assessed faithfully, so we that we know where kids stand,\u201d Bush said, noting that Common Core had been adopted by 45 states. \u201cStates that don't want to participate \u2014 that\u2019s fine. It\u2019s a voluntary deal.\"\n\nOn Twitter: @LATSeema", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Former Florida Gov.
