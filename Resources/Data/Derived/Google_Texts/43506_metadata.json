Hickey, who oversaw the benefits wing of the department, quit her job amid a congressional investigation into misuse of taxpayer funds.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nUnder her watch, the VA backlog fell from 611,000 claims in March of 2013 to fewer than 74,000, although the reliability of those statistics has been called into question.\n\nVA Secretary Bob McDonald announced Hickey\u2019s resignation in a statement on Friday, but did not offer a reason for her departure. He praised Hickey for her \u201ccommitment to excellence and service to our country.\u201d\n\nAn internal watchdog investigation released several weeks ago found irregularities in promotions and reimbursements among senior executives in her department.\n\nNearly two-dozen executives were promoted and given raises despite a pay freeze among top-level employees.\n\nOne senior executive was also improperly reimbursed for $300,000 in relocation expenses approved by Hickey, the report found.\n\nThe House Committee on Veterans\u2019 Affairs scheduled a hearing on the matter for this Wednesday and called for Hickey to appear as a witness.\n\nCommittee Chairman Jeff Miller (R-Fla.) has been critical of her management, saying she \u201cwas not cut out for the job.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe leaves the department amid a damning office of inspector general report linking her to a scheme in which senior Veteran Benefits Administration (VBA) officials abused their authority, resulting in the misuse of hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars,\u201d Miller said in a statement.\n\n\u201cAnd though VA statistics show the disability benefits backlog shrank on her watch, those figures must be taken with a healthy grain of salt in light of assertions from prominent veterans groups and even VA\u2019s own inspector general that the department\u2019s backlog numbers are not to be trusted,\u201d he continued.\n\nIn a farewell email to colleagues, Hickey said her goal during her four-and-a-half years with the department was to \u201ctransform VBA and to help so many veterans, service members, their families and survivors.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Allison A.
