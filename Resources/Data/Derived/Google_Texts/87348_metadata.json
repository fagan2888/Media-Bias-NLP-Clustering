And they have come up with a plan.\n\n\u201cWe have to fix this problem because it\u2019s gotten to the point where we\u2019re spending an exorbitant amount of money, and not getting any return on that. And we\u2019re not any safer because of it,\u201d said Representative Emily Virgin.\n\nRepresentative Emily Virgin is working with community leaders on a ballot initiative to re-vamp the state's criminal justice system. The group, calling itself \"Oklahomans for Criminal Justice Reform\" wants to see sentencing changed for non-violent, low level offenders.\n\n\u201cThose people we believe can be rehabilitated. And we are willing to give them that second chance because they are non-violent offenders,\u201d continued Rep.

The group hopes to collect 86,000 signatures on a petition to have the initiative put on the ballot in November.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "One Oklahoma group says they can save the state millions with prison reform.
