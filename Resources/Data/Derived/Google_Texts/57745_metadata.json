Coverage for small business would begin in 2016 and coverage for individuals would start in 2017.\n\nThe existing exchange, or marketplace, was established under a partnership agreement between the state and the federal government. The 2013 state law that created the marketplace charges it with deciding whether the state should operate its own exchange and guiding the state through the switch.\n\nThe soonest a state-run exchange could be established is July of next year, but Executive Director Cheryl Smith said the board did not want to rush into it.\n\n\u201cI think that they saw wisdom in taking a phased approach to all of this. In other words, let\u2019s put a toe in the water now,\u201d she said.\n\nSmith said a Small Business Health Options Program, or SHOP, is relatively simple to set up because unlike an individual exchange, no federal subsidies will be available through it, so a system of determining eligibility for subsidies will not be necessary.\n\n\u201cThe SHOP is much less complex technologically to do, so it would seem the smart place to smart,\u201d she said.\n\nDemocratic Gov. Mike Beebe supported establishing a state-run exchange from the beginning, but because of legislative resistance he directed state officials to pursue the partnership. Beebe has no objection to the phased-in approach the board wants to take, according to spokesman Matt DeCample.\n\n\u201cIf they think it\u2019s going to take two years to complete that, that\u2019s their call,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso last week, the Government Accountability Office, an agency that conducts audits and investigations for Congress, released a report arguing that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services failed to ensure that the so-called private option, Arkansas\u2019 version of Medicaid expansion, would be budget-neutral.\n\nUnder the private option, Arkansas takes money provided under the federal Affordable Care Act for Medicaid expansion and uses it to subsidize private health insurance for people earning up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level. By the end of August, 194,257 Arkansans had enrolled in the program.\n\nThe federal government will pay the full cost of the program for its first three years unless Arkansas exceeds a \u201cbudget neutrality cap.\u201d So far the program\u2019s costs have exceeded the cap on a month-to-month basis, but the state Department of Human Services has predicted that will change.\n\nThe GAO said in its report that HHS set the cap at $778 million more than the cost of traditional Medicaid expansion would have been, and did so based on assumptions the state made without being required to show supporting data \u2014 including the assumption that traditional Medicaid expansion would have required raising Medicaid reimbursement rates.\n\nHHS disagreed, saying the budget cap was based on the most reasonable cost assumptions available. Arkansas officials also disputed the report.\n\n\u201cHistorically, clients across the country have had difficulties getting access to physicians willing to take Medicaid because of the low payment rates,\u201d DHS said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s unreasonable to assume we could add hundreds of thousands of clients to the traditional program and not have had to raise rates.\u201d\n\nSen. David Sanders, R-Little Rock, one of the architects of the private option, said he believes the state and HHS are \u201con solid ground.\u201d Arkansas doctors would not have agreed to see an influx of new Medicaid patients without demanding a rate increase, he said.\n\n\u201cThe GAO doesn\u2019t understand the dynamics that exist in Arkansas, and it doesn\u2019t understand market dynamics,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Sen. Bryan King, R-Green Forest, who opposes the private option, said the report weakens the case for renewing the program in the session that begins in January.\n\n\u201cIt just points out, now that we\u2019re into the program, exactly what some of us have said: That this is a more expensive program than what they\u2019ve anticipated. I mean, they haven\u2019t been right on any figures yet so far, in any of their projections that they started out with,\u201d he said.\n\nAppropriating federal funds to continue the program will require a three-fourths vote of both chambers of the Legislature.", "article_metadata": {"description": "LITTLE ROCK \u2014 The Arkansas Health Insurance Marketplace Board made a major decision in the past week, while the debate over private option heated up with the release of a report arguing the program will not be budget-neutral for the federal government.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "John Lyon Arkansas News Bureau jlyon@arkansasnews.com", "og": {"url": "http://arkansasnews.com/news/arkansas/arkansas-moving-toward-state-insurance-exchange-private-option-debate-heating", "site_name": "Arkansas News", "type": "article", "description": "LITTLE ROCK \u2014 The Arkansas Health Insurance Marketplace Board made a major decision in the past week, while the debate over private option heated up with the release of a report arguing the program will not be budget-neutral for the federal government.", "title": "Arkansas moving toward state insurance exchange; private option debate heating up"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://arkansasnews.com/news/arkansas/arkansas-moving-toward-state-insurance-exchange-private-option-debate-heating", "title": "Arkansas moving toward state insurance exchange; private option debate heating up", "card": "summary", "creator": "@arkansasnews"}, "keywords": "Arkansas,News,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-14T02:00:05-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=0.9"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdca22\"", "article_summary": "The board voted Wednesday to seek to set up a state-run exchange for small businesses in 2015 and a state-run exchange for individuals in 2016.\nMike Beebe supported establishing a state-run exchange from the beginning, but because of legislative resistance he directed state officials to pursue the partnership.\nThe soonest a state-run exchange could be established is July of next year, but Executive Director Cheryl Smith said the board did not want to rush into it.\nThe 2013 state law that created the marketplace charges it with deciding whether the state should operate its own exchange and guiding the state through the switch.\nUnder the private option, Arkansas takes money provided under the federal Affordable Care Act for Medicaid expansion and uses it to subsidize private health insurance for people earning up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level."}
