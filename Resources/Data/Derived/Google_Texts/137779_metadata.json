In all likelihood you have no idea, even if you have a decent working knowledge of what private exchanges are.\n\nSome confusion is understandable. For one thing, each private exchange differs from the others, often in quite fundamental ways. \u201cIf you\u2019ve seen one, you\u2019ve seen one,\u201d says Michael Thompson, a principal in the health-care practice at PricewaterhouseCoopers, of private exchanges.\n\nAlso, the roster of exchanges includes several offered by the very consulting firms that large companies look to for advice on human-capital matters, including health benefits. PwC was a co-sponsor of research released on Dec. 12 finding that 69 percent of 723 employers, across an expansive range of sizes and industries, believe it is \u201cvery important\u201d that their human-capital adviser be independent of any exchange they\u2019re considering.\n\nTo be sure, PwC has skin in the game. It doesn\u2019t offer an exchange, but it competes with the consulting firms that do \u2014 Aon Hewitt, Buck Consultants, Mercer and Towers Watson \u2014 for human-capital advisory business. On the other hand, the other research sponsors are four health-care-focused employer coalitions. \u201cCertainly our members rate the value of having independent evaluation on private exchanges as very helpful,\u201d says Emma Hoo, a director at one of the coalitions, the Pacific Business Group on Health (PBGH).\n\nPwC, the PBGH, its counterpart organizations the Northeast Business Group on Health and the Midwest Business Group on Health, and the Employers Health Coalition (composed of Ohio employers) recently formed the Private Exchange Evaluation Collaborative (PEEC) to give much-needed, objective assessments of the private-exchange marketplace. The regional coalitions have somewhat differing menus of services but are generally focused on educating member employers on health-care issues and helping them arrange for better, lower-cost health insurance and services.\n\n\u201cA variety of brokers, consultants, payers and other intermediaries are offering private exchanges, creating a mix of potential vested interests among these service providers,\u201d the PEEC noted in its research report. \u201cAs a result, employers are seeking an objective source of information and advice as they evaluate potential private exchange strategies and the vendors that could support them.\u201d\n\nThe consulting firms know they can\u2019t credibly be independent when it comes to private-exchange evaluation, Thompson says, \u201cso they\u2019re already sharing lots of information with us \u2014 they know we will play a role in helping employers understand these products.\u201d The PEEC is preparing a request for information that it plans to distribute to private exchanges shortly after the new year begins.\n\nThe Cost Arrow Points\u2026 Where?\n\nAmong the chief things companies want to know, naturally, is whether they can expect to save money by going with a private exchange. At present the majority are skeptical: only 25 percent of survey respondents said they believe the move would lower their health-care costs. Still, 45 percent of the participants expect to consider using a private exchange for active employees by 2017 or have already implemented one.\n\n\u201cJust considering it is a very low bar,\u201d Thompson observes. \u201cIt\u2019s unlikely that 45 percent will implement. But what we are hearing from our clients is that everything is on the table. The private exchanges, not to mention the public exchanges, are very new, and when companies are thinking about their strategies, they\u2019re not discounting those options.\u201d\n\nIndeed, if anything, companies are eyeing the public exchanges as a more likely long-term path. A surprising 58 percent of survey respondents said that if they\u2019re permitted to contribute money toward employees\u2019 coverage on public exchanges in 2017 or after, they would consider doing so. (At present, the public exchanges are available only to individuals and employers with fewer than 50 full-time workers or equivalents, but a provision of the Affordable Care Act will let states give access to larger companies starting in 2017.)\n\n\u201cExchanges are the talk of the town,\u201d notes Tim Prichard, head of the national employee benefits practice at insurance broker Wells Fargo Insurance Services USA, explaining employers\u2019 high level of interest in them. But Prichard is skeptical that moving to a private exchange will result in a long-term cost benefit.\n\nThat\u2019s especially so, he says, for companies that switch from self-insurance to fully insured plans, which for larger employers are generally considered about 6 percent to 8 percent more expensive. Virtually all private exchanges accommodate fully insured plans, while only some are also set up for self-insured plans. (Aon Hewitt representatives, whose exchange is for insured plans only, have insisted that its model can save money even for clients that were formerly self-insured.)\n\nBut, says Prichard, \u201cAlmost any company could see a cost decrease in the first year\u201d of using a private exchange, because carriers are subsidizing initial plan costs with low pricing on administrative services and on dental, vision and non-medical insurance products offered through the exchanges. With fully insured plans they are subsidizing premiums in some instances as well, he adds. \u201cThe question is, what will happen in years two, three and four? Depending on the geographic location where the health plan is offered and the competition there, the carriers are making subsidized bets that if they get people on the platform, in future years those people will stay on the platform even while prices rise.\u201d\n\nPartly for that reason, Wells Fargo Insurance Services \u2014 which is strictly a broker, not an insurer \u2014 is hedging its bets on the private-exchange market. It is helping small corporate customers enroll in public exchanges and providing consulting services for those looking into or implementing private exchanges. But it\u2019s not yet creating its own exchange, as some other brokers are doing.\n\nBut private exchanges, which first targeted small companies, have landed many new midsized and large customers this year. Such employers didn\u2019t do it so they could spend more money on health care, even if they also appreciated the enhanced employee benefit of more health-plan choices that most private exchanges offer. Some exchanges, for example, promise to deliver savings resulting from vigorous price competition among carriers.\n\nAlso, companies might be able to save money over time by making direct contributions to employees that the workers can use to buy insurance through the exchange. That differs from the longstanding prevalent model employers use to fund health benefits: paying for a fixed percentage of premiums (in the case of fully insured plans) or actual health-care costs (in the case of self-insured plans) and deducting the rest from employees\u2019 pay.\n\nSome say the difference between those two approaches is mostly illusory and amounts to little more than an elaborate shell game with an effectively net-zero result. But so far it has proved that when employees have greater choice of health plans and buy them with their own money, they tend to pick plans with lower premiums and higher cost-sharing through deductibles, co-pays and co-insurance.\n\nCompanies can benefit from that tendency by sharing in any savings associated with either behavioral changes by employees (e.g., consuming less health care because of the higher deductibles and co-pays) or higher-value consumption (e.g., using urgent-care facilities rather than emergency rooms, for the same reason), says Thompson. Less directly, employees with less-rich plans tend to be more engaged in staying healthy and to learn healthier habits over time, he adds.\n\n\u201cUntil we acknowledge and address the fact that it\u2019s the high degree of demand for and utilization of health-care resources that is driving costs, [there won\u2019t be] a private-exchange strategy that is really meaningful,\u201d says Jim Blaney, CEO of the human capital practice at Willis North America, a unit of insurance broker and risk adviser Willis Group Holdings.\n\nFaulty Funding Mechanism?\n\nDespite the potential savings, a defined-contribution strategy has some potentially steep pitfalls. \u201cWhat gets really tricky is that to the extent the rates of plans in private exchanges vary by area or employee age, with a fixed contribution you\u2019d be overcompensating people in low-cost areas and young people,\u201d says Thompson.\n\nAlso, the simple fact that an employer\u2019s health-care costs float along with the health experience of its population may be troublesome. \u201cSay you go up by 20 percent, which can happen,\u201d he says. \u201cWould you shift that entire adverse fluctuation onto your employees so that you can maintain your fixed contribution, or would you cushion it the way you\u2019ve always done? It\u2019s not clear how sustainable a defined-contribution approach can be.\u201d\n\nBut some other aspects of private-exchange product models may produce savings. For example, Buck Consultants conducts market-by-market negotiations with carriers and offers plans from one specific carrier to its exchange customers in each geographic market. And at least one exchange vendor reportedly is leveraging the volume of employees enrolled in its exchange across all customers so as to provide reduced rates for pharmacy-benefits-management and administrative services (rather than, as in the above example, individual carriers offering reduced administrative rates).\n\nStill, Hoo says companies are being prudently cautious about diving into private exchanges. \u201cNone of our members are currently using private exchanges for active employees,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of movement from insured products to self-funding over the past decade. It\u2019s not clear that employers are ready to reverse themselves, and there\u2019s insufficient understanding of the pros and cons of maintaining a self-funded approach within some of the private exchanges. There\u2019s also not sufficient understanding of what\u2019s behind the curtain in terms of risk adjustment in these purchasing arrangements.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the PEEC research found that respondents see a number of barriers to widespread adoption of private exchanges for active employees. More than 80 percent of the respondents cited each of the following as a potential barrier: immaturity of the private exchange market; stability of cost over time; stability or track record of exchange administrator; limited information regarding private exchanges; and employee readiness. And those factors are just the top portion of the iceberg. Ten other potential barriers were cited by between 38 and 78 percent of respondents.\n\nBut overall, says Prichard, the important thing to remember about private exchanges is that they are a fairly new idea and are evolving. \u201cWho\u2019s to say that some human resources cloud technology company, for example, won\u2019t come out with something unique, a more innovative approach to private exchanges than we\u2019re seeing now?\u201d he asks.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Health Insurance: four health-care employer groups, plus PwC, ask: Might a private health benefits exchange be right for the company\u2019s active employees?", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Health Groups Join to Uncover Truth about Private Exchanges\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.cfo.com\\/health-benefits\\/2013\\/12\\/health-groups-join-uncover-truth-private-exchanges\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2013-12-18 15:40:55\",\"mod_date\":\"2015-06-04 14:25:23\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":24427,\"author_id\":\"6\",\"author_name\":null,\"author_display_name\":\"David McCann\",\"tags\":[\"Consulting Firms\",\"direct contributions\",\"Employer Health Care\",\"Employers Health Coalition\",\"Exchange Market\"],\"categories\":[\"Health Benefits\",\"Human Capital &amp; Careers\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/cdn.cfo.com\\/content\\/uploads\\/2013\\/12\\/question-meeting-secret.jpg\"}", "author": "David McCann", "og": {"site_name": "CFO", "description": "Health Insurance: four health-care employer groups, plus PwC, ask: Might a private health benefits exchange be right for the company\u2019s active employees?", "title": "Health Groups Join to Uncover Truth about Private Exchanges", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.cfo.com/content/uploads/2013/12/question-meeting-secret.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-06-04T14:25:23+00:00", "url": "http://ww2.cfo.com/health-benefits/2013/12/health-groups-join-uncover-truth-private-exchanges/", "type": "article"}, "media": "Article", "twitter": {"domain": "CFO", "description": "Health Insurance: four health-care employer groups, plus PwC, ask: Might a private health benefits exchange be right for the company\u2019s active employees?", "creator": "@cfo", "title": "Health Groups Join to Uncover Truth about Private Exchanges", "site": "@cfo", "card": "summary", "account_id": 44906914}, "generator": "Easy Digital Downloads v2.2.2", "topicRoot": "Human Capital & Careers", "topic": "Health Benefits", "headline": "Health Groups Join to Uncover Truth about Private Exchanges", "fb": {"admins": 15609421}, "date": 20131218, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CFOConferences", "section": "Human Capital & Careers", "tag": "Wells Fargo Insurance Services", "published_time": "2013-12-18T15:40:55+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-04T14:25:23+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "consulting firms, direct contributions, employer health care, employers health coalition, exchange market, health benefits, health care costs, insurance, michael thompson, midwest business group on health, mwgh, nbgh, northeast business group on health, pacific business group on health, pbgh, peec, pricewaterhousecoopers, private exchange evaluation collaborative, private exchanges, private health benefits, public exchanges, tim prichard, wells fargo insurance services"}, "article_summary": "In all likelihood you have no idea, even if you have a decent working knowledge of what private exchanges are.\n\u201cIf you\u2019ve seen one, you\u2019ve seen one,\u201d says Michael Thompson, a principal in the health-care practice at PricewaterhouseCoopers, of private exchanges.\nBut overall, says Prichard, the important thing to remember about private exchanges is that they are a fairly new idea and are evolving.\nIt is helping small corporate customers enroll in public exchanges and providing consulting services for those looking into or implementing private exchanges.\nVirtually all private exchanges accommodate fully insured plans, while only some are also set up for self-insured plans."}
