Reuters\n\nDaytime talk shows aren\u2019t just a sub-prime substitute for actual conversation with your doctor, a new study finds. They could actually be destructive to your health.\n\nIn our world of information overload, the health advice that gets relayed via commercialized, ad-infused programming isn\u2019t always reliable. In fact, according to the new study, conducted by researchers at the University of Alberta, as little as half the claims made by on-air personas on The Doctors and Dr. Mehmet Oz, of The Dr. Oz Show, can be supported with scientific evidence.\n\n\u201cPeople need to be skeptical,\u201d said Dr. Christina Korownyk, lead author and associate professor of family medicine, to Medical Daily. Today\u2019s personal health landscape is fraught with conflicting advice on what to eat, how to exercise, and when to indulge. Without a skeptical eye toward more personalized approaches \u2014 rather than generalized ones \u2014 people risk paying the price of substandard health. \u201cThey need to gather more information before making decisions based on those recommendations,\u201d Korownyk added.\n\nIn their study, the researchers gathered data on 40 episodes from The Doctors and The Dr. Oz Show. Experts from various health-focused disciplines analyzed a random collection of 80 pieces of health advice from each show for their scientific accuracy. To qualify as evidence-backed, each piece of advice had to accompany at least one case study, or a better piece of evidence, that corroborated the claim.\n\nIn total, 54 percent of the recommendations were verified. For recommendations in The Dr. Oz Show, evidence supported 46 percent of the claims, was absent for 39 percent, and outright contradicted the claims 15 percent of the time. For The Doctors, 63 percent were verified, 24 percent had no evidence, and 14 percent contradicted.\n\nKorownyk C, et al. BMJ .\n\nWhere the advice tended to slip mostly involved dietary and nutritional claims. One of the hallmarks of Dr. Oz\u2019s program is a revelatory new and hidden ingredient or supplement that can knock out arthritis pain or zap away blemishes. Sometimes the surgeon\u2019s claims have gone too far. In June, the U.S. Senate held a hearing taking Oz to task for his claims that Pure Green Coffee Beans were a \u201cmagic weight-loss cure\u201d and \u201cthe No. 1 miracle in a bottle.\u201d Chairwoman of the Senate\u2019s Consume Protect Panel Claire McCaskill challenged Oz\u2019s intentions.\n\n\u201cWhen you call a product a miracle, and it's something you can buy, and it's something that gives people false hope, I just don't understand why you need to go there,\u201d McCaskill told Oz at the time. During his hearing, the doctor repeatedly endorsed the products, despite the absence of total empirical proof.\n\nSome may say the shows aren\u2019t purely for medical advice, or even partially for that purpose. In the fine print of both programs\u2019 websites lurks the familiar warning: This website is for informational and entertainment purposes only and is not a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis or treatment.\n\nIf there is any gray area, it is in the balance between what is informational and what is entertainment. Korownyk herself was hesitant to comment on the exact nature of the system that lets 15 percent of health claims slip through the cracks, to the point of contradiction, she conceded that prior discussions with her colleagues concluded the machine of television is \u201crather complex.\u201d To their mind, it probably has to do with some mix of advertising loyalty and a desire for exposure that lets health claims go unfounded. Personnel from neither The Doctors nor The Dr. Oz Show immediately returned a request for comment.\n\nThe best a home-viewer can do is remain skeptical of the information being presented. But as Korownyk points out, even that may be too much effort. With the entire catalog of human knowledge conveniently filed away in web pages, listening to a half hour of health advice, just for the sake of entertainment, may not strike people with the same measure of force or relatability as the daytime soap opera just one channel away. The entire premise of the daytime health talk show may be flawed.\n\n\u201cAn interesting question is whether we should expect medical talk shows to provide more than entertainment,\u201d the authors conclude in their report. \u201cDecisions around healthcare issues are often challenging and require much more than non-specific recommendations based on little or no evidence from media health professionals.\u201d\n\nSource: Korownyk C, Kolber M, McCormack J, et al.
