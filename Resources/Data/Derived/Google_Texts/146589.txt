WASHINGTON — A bill introduced Wednesday in Congress would grant extra benefits to veterans pursuing degrees in science or tech occupations.

Reps. Dina Titus, D-Nev., and David McKinley, R-W.Va., are proposing an additional nine months of GI Bill benefits to students working toward degrees in so-called STEM fields of science, technology, engineering or math.

McKinley said the idea came after meeting with student veterans who told him it was difficult to complete requirements in complex fields within the 36 months allocated by the GI Bill.

Titus said in a House speech that analysis and communication skills veterans pick up in the military make them strong candidates to succeed in tech fields. Encouraging more of them to pursue STEM careers “will help meet the demands for a high skilled workforce.”
