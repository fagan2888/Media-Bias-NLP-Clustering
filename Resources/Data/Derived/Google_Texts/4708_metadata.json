Researchers will also measure patient out-of-pocket costs and their knowledge of the risks, benefits and costs of colony-stimulating factor treatment.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to improve adherence to clinical practice guidelines in the low- and high-risk chemotherapy settings, where the evidence for PP-CSF use is well-established,\u201d said Ramsey. \u201cAt the same time, we will generate new evidence on the benefits and risks of PP-CSF for commonly prescribed, intermediate-risk chemotherapy regimens where more evidence is needed for patients and providers to make informed decisions.\u201d\n\nAccording to Ramsey, patients, patient advocates, oncologists, insurance plan leaders, policy makers, an ethicist and leaders of the community clinics where the study will be implemented all contributed to the design of the study.\n\nAnd patient care is the bottom line, said Dr. Gary Lyman, medical oncologist and co-director of HICOR.\n\n\u201cIn the end, this is about the patient and improving the delivery of optimal and more personalized supportive care in order to reduce the risk of serious complications while improving the quality, efficiency and overall value of cancer treatment,\u201d he said.\n\nPCORI grants aim to provide patients with information that will help them make better-informed decisions about their care. The HICOR study is also one of the first studies selected for funding through PCORI\u2019s Pragmatic Clinical Studies Initiative, an effort to produce results that are broadly applicable to a greater variety of patients and care situation and can be more quickly taken up in routine clinical practice.\n\nOther recipients of PCORI grants include the University of California at San Francisco, Wake Forest University Health Sciences in North Carolina, the Kaiser Foundation Research Institute in California and the University of Pittsburgh.\n\nDiane Mapes is a staff writer at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.
