Business groups insist that the new regulation will be remarkably expensive.\n\nThe National Association of Manufacturers released a study in February claiming updated rules will cost the U.S. economy $1.7 trillion between 2017 and 2040. Another study compiled by NERA Economic Consulting at the request of the manufacturing group estimated that reducing ozone regulations to 65 ppb would cost the average household $830 a year.\n\nMcCarthy has dismissed those numbers as exaggerated and on Thursday said, \u201cThe National Association of Manufacturers has said a lot of things in the last 30 years \u2026 I am not looking at what other people are saying.\u201d\n\nThe EPA has emphasized its own studies, which reported that ground-level ozone regulations at 70 ppb translate into numerous public health benefits\u2014reducing the number of sick days and emergency room visits, for example\u2014that would save $6.4 billion-$13 billion per year by 2025. But at the same time, when the rules were first proposed late last year, the EPA acknowledged a compliance cost of close to $3.9 billion a year by 2025.\n\n\u201cObviously, this is going to cost a lot,\u201d said Kish of IER, a group that looks to address energy and environmental issues with free-market solutions and opposed toughening the ozone standards. \u201cIf communities fail to be in compliance with this, EPA is in position to begin not allowing permits. If a factory wants to be built, they can say, \u2018Sorry, we can\u2019t give you any permits because you happen to be out of compliance.\u2019\u201d\n\nA big reason for the expense? Stricter ozone regulations means factories and power plants have to install scrubbers and other technologies on smokestacks to reduce the chemicals put into the air. Scrubbers can cost tens of millions of dollars, and each degree that the ozone standard is lowered, the costs pile up.\n\nBut McCarthy said she\u2019s confident the new rule will not be overly burdensome, and the agency \u201cis giving states plenty of time\u201d to meet the standard by 2025.\n\n\u201cThe science clearly tells us that 75 ppb is not adequately protecting public health,\u201d McCarthy said.\n\nAs for predictions that large numbers of counties across the country won\u2019t be able to meet the goals, McCarthy said, \u201cWe can\u2019t tell you the number exactly, but we\u2019ve looked at modeling this issue.\u201d\n\nShe added that EPA projections say just 14 counties outside of California will be out of attainment by 2025.\n\n\u201cUltimately, the existing level of 75 [ppb] was adequate,\u201d Kish said. \u201cSome communities haven\u2019t even met the 75 limit. One of the things elected officials around the country have said is, why not wait until we meet the existing limit, which we\u2019ve been working hard on?\u201d\n\nGeorge Heartwell, the mayor of Grand Rapids, Michigan, appeared on the conference call with McCarthy in support of lowering the ozone level to 70 ppb.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m confident in the time allowed in this new rule we\u2019ll be able to meet the new standard,\u201d Heartwell said. \u201cI strongly believe the crisis of global warming and its effects on the environment provide us with moral imperatives. We must be good stewards.\u201d\n\nBut other elected officials have pushed back at the EPA\u2014even those who are usually supportive of the Obama administration.\n\nLast month, Colorado\u2019s top two Democrats\u2014Gov. John Hickenlooper and U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet\u2014said they were \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d whether the Rocky Mountain State could afford to make the changes needed and echoed complaints from other high-altitude states such as New Mexico that stricter ozone standards hurt them more than states closer to sea level.\n\n\u201cBecause of pollution that\u2019s coming in from other Western states, from across the globe, from across wildfires in the West, we have significant parts of our state that would be non-attainment zones from the very beginning of the law,\u201d Bennet said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t make any sense, it\u2019s not going to work.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese are always difficult decisions,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cWhat the Clean Air Act tells me to do is to make my best judgment based on the science \u2026 It should be no less than what I need to do and no more. In the end it\u2019s a judgment call by the (EPA) administrator \u2026 I realized how serious this decision is. I did not base it on a popularity contest.\u201d\n\nWhen will the new rule go into effect? The EPA will designate areas in 2017. Those that don\u2019t attain 70 ppb will have from 2020 to 2037 to meet the standard, with the deadlines varying based on the severity of their ozone pollution.\n\n\u201cFor me, what does this mean for foregone investment?\u201d Kish said. \u201cPeople who might invest in something or want to expand something. It\u2019s going to limit opportunities that would have otherwise been there. The hidden costs of this is often what\u2019s hardest to determine but \u2026 they\u2019re real, they\u2019re palpable. People make business decisions based on this.\u201d\n\nOriginally published in Watchdog.org.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Colorado\u2019s top two Democrats, among others, are \"deeply concerned\" by new clean air regulations promulgated by Obama's EPA.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Colorado\u2019s top two Democrats, among others, are \"deeply concerned\" by new clean air regulations promulgated by Obama's EPA.", "title": "New EPA Regulation Causes Concern Even Among Democrats", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/105mccarthy.jpg", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1iRuDFj"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Colorado\u2019s top two Democrats, among others, are \"deeply concerned\" by new clean air regulations promulgated by Obama's EPA.", "title": "New EPA Regulation Causes Concern Even Among Democrats", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/105mccarthy.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Energy", "tag": "climate change", "published_time": "2015-10-05T16:36:05+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "environmental protection agency,carbon dioxide,ozone,climate change,gina mccarthy,colorado,john hickenlooper"}, "article_summary": "On the opposite spectrum, environmental and health groups complained that the EPA should have strengthened the standard to 60 ppb.\nScrubbers can cost tens of millions of dollars, and each degree that the ozone standard is lowered, the costs pile up.\nEven though many came into Thursday\u2019s announcement expecting the EPA to set a standard of 65 ppb, business groups still said the regulation will result in more burdensome and expensive changes.\n\u201cIf communities fail to be in compliance with this, EPA is in position to begin not allowing permits.\nIn the end it\u2019s a judgment call by the (EPA) administrator \u2026 I realized how serious this decision is."}
