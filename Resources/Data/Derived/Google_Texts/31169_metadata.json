(HealthNewsDigest.com) - Rhinoplasty, which is more commonly called \" nose surgery ,\" is a very rewarding procedure that can leave patients with life-changing results. Many individuals interested in this procedure have several questions about the aftermath of rhinoplasty. One of them being:\n\nDeveloping a cold after rhinoplasty should have no effect on the final results. Patients should just be a little more cautious and abstain from moving the nose or touching the sutures.\n\nThat said, here are a few simple guidelines to keep in mind:\n\nWhat to Do\n\nOftentimes a cold will increase swelling in the nasal passages and cause increased drainage in the nose. Nasal saline rinse and over-the-counter antihistamine tablets can help clear passageways and dry up the nose while keeping it clear.\n\nWhat Not to Do\n\nBlowing the nose after a rhinoplasty is not recommended as this can irritate the sutures that have been placed in the nose and alter the overall shape. Gently blotting the nose should be acceptable, providing that patients do not move the nose when doing so.\n\nWith any plastic surgery procedure, be sure to remember that following the surgeon's post-operative instructions greatly decreases the chances of developing complications.\n\nIf you are interested in scheduling a rhinoplasty, please call The Bitar Cosmetic Surgery Institute at (703) 206-0506 today.
