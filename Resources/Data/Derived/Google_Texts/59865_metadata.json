Getty Images\n\nThe funeral for former archbishop of New York Cardinal Edward Egan, who died Thursday at 82, has been set for Tuesday, the Archdiocese of New York said on Friday.\n\nFuneral arrangements will begin Monday, starting with a two-hour private family visitation at 10 a.m. at New York\u2019s St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral. Beginning at noon, the cathedral will be open until 6 p.m. for public visitation and then a vigil mass.\n\nA funeral Mass led by Cardinal Timothy Dolan will be held Tuesday afternoon and begin with a procession at 1:30 p.m. The entombment will immediately follow the Mass. Public visitation hours on Tuesday will run from 7 to 11 a.m.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, the Archdiocese of New York is asking that memorial donations be made to the Inner-City College Fund and to the restoration of St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral.\n\nDuring his years as archbishop of New York from 2000 to 2009, Cardinal Egan helped to shore up the archdiocese through cost-cutting, closing parishes and schools, and fundraising. He previously led the Diocese of Bridgeport, Conn., for 12 years and served in a variety of positions in Rome. He was a canon lawyer with an international reputation and a staunch advocate of Catholic education.\n\nIn his retirement, Cardinal Egan continued to serve the archdiocese and often attended events on behalf of Cardinal Dolan, celebrating parish anniversaries around the city and presiding over confirmation ceremonies. He died in his Manhattan residence at the Chapel of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "The funeral for former archbishop of New York Cardinal Edward Egan, who died Thursday at 82, has been set for Tuesday, the Archdiocese of New York said on Friday.", "title": "Cardinal Edward Egan\u2019s Funeral Set for March 10", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2015/03/06/cardinal-edward-egans-funeral-set-for-march-10/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-HG553_0305eg_P_20150305152135.jpg"}, "site": "WSJNY", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "New York", "article.headline": "Cardinal Edward Egan\u2019s Funeral Set for March 10", "description": "The funeral for former archbishop of New York Cardinal Edward Egan, who died Thursday at 82, has been set for Tuesday, the Archdiocese of New York said on Friday.", "article_section": "New York", "author": "Melanie Grayce West", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Metropolis Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Metropolis", "article.summary": "The funeral for former archbishop of New York Cardinal Edward Egan, who died Thursday at 82, has been set for Tuesday, the Archdiocese of New York said on Friday.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2015-03-06T20:34:28-05:00", "dj.asn": "10-140", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2015/03/06/cardinal-edward-egans-funeral-set-for-march-10/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-METROB-22654", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "New York", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "The funeral for former archbishop of New York Cardinal Edward Egan, who died Thursday at 82, has been set for Tuesday, the Archdiocese of New York said on Friday.", "title": "Cardinal Edward Egan\u2019s Funeral Set for March 10", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2015/03/06/cardinal-edward-egans-funeral-set-for-march-10/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-HG553_0305eg_P_20150305152135.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Metropolis", "article.id": "BL-METROB-22654", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2015-03-06T20:45:02-05:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcd43\"", "article_summary": "Getty ImagesThe funeral for former archbishop of New York Cardinal Edward Egan, who died Thursday at 82, has been set for Tuesday, the Archdiocese of New York said on Friday.\nFuneral arrangements will begin Monday, starting with a two-hour private family visitation at 10 a.m. at New York\u2019s St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral.\nIn his retirement, Cardinal Egan continued to serve the archdiocese and often attended events on behalf of Cardinal Dolan, celebrating parish anniversaries around the city and presiding over confirmation ceremonies.\nCardinal Edward Egan smiles to the crowd gathered outside St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral after celebrating his final Easter mass as archbishop of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York in 2009.\nA funeral Mass led by Cardinal Timothy Dolan will be held Tuesday afternoon and begin with a procession at 1:30 p.m."}
