BAUDETTE, Minn. (AP) - Authorities in northern Minnesota have found the boat apparently used by a Twin Cities CEO whose body was recovered from a river.

The Lake of the Woods County sheriff's office said Friday it believes it has located John Stiglich's 14-foot camouflage boat. Authorities plan to recover the boat early in the coming week.

The 52-year-old Stiglich, of Shoreview, was found floating Monday in Rainy River a mile east of Baudette. He was pronounced dead at a hospital.

The Hibbing native was CEO of St. Paul-based Cirdan Health Systems and Consulting, a health care consulting and information systems firm. Stiglich's family says he was spending last weekend at the family's cabin on Rainy River with friends when the accident happened.

Preliminary autopsy results are undetermined, pending toxicology reports. The investigation continues.
