iSelectMD, which started in 2010 on Hilton Head Island, is an over-the-phone medical service that connects patients with nonemergency ailments to certified physicians. It's part of an emerging trend in health care called telemedicine, an umbrella-term for services that use technology -- video, telephones, even social media -- to bridge the gap between doctor and patient.
