Three days ago, Netflix bought the exclusive subscription video rights to the series, in a move that Deadline, which first reported the news, described as \u201cunprecedented.\u201d What\u2019s even more interesting is that Netflix, potentially shelling out as much as $1.75 million per episode, made the move in an effort to expand its international audience.\n\nThat Netflix is using \u201cGotham,\u201d a prequel to the Batman stories, as part of its international growth strategy speaks to the power of the Batman story, and, in particular, the allure of origin stories, which somehow manage to reel us in again and again. The series follows a younger police commissioner James Gordon, upon the murder of young Bruce Wayne\u2019s parents, and shows the origins of the Batman villains like Two-Face, the Penguin, the Joker and Poison Ivy along with the evolution of the city. The pilot episode has gotten largely positive reviews.\n\nFor insight into why origin stories captivate us, Salon reached out to clinical psychologist Robin Rosenberg, who has written about \u201cThe Psychology of Superheroes.\u201d She explained that origin stories have the power to humanize \u2014 but sometimes, that gets in the way of establishing a strong character.\n\nWhy are we so obsessed with origin stories?\n\nWith people, we\u2019re interested in origin stories for several reasons. One is that we like people to be predictable. Not in a bad way, but we just like to pigeonhole people. We like to understand them, where they\u2019re coming from, and why they do what they do \u2014 which then makes them predictable. It also gives us context. So if we know someone is really sensitive about a particular topic, we\u2019re more willing to work with that. If we understand why they get twitchy or why they get angry or why they break down crying. Whatever their response is, if we kind of understand it, we don\u2019t think they\u2019re weird. Origin stories help us make sense of another person.\n\nWe all have quirks and oddities. Some of us are better at hiding them than others. For people who aren\u2019t as good at hiding them or don\u2019t want to hide them, it also helps us understand their quirks and oddities.\n\nHow do we psychologically treat heroes differently from villains in origin stories?\n\nIt\u2019s actually all point of view. So Magneto \u2014 on the one hand we\u2019d both agree he\u2019s a villain. On the other hand, from his perspective \u2014 he\u2019s not like the Joker, who basically wreaks havoc for fun \u2014 he feels he is being a hero to his people. He is acting heroically, potentially sacrificing himself for the benefit of mutantkind. So in that context, whether he\u2019s a hero or a villain is all point of view. In Batman\u2019s world, there\u2019s a character named Poison Ivy. She is what we could call an eco-terrorist. But from her point of view, she actually is being heroic because she has a mission and purpose that is greater than herself and for which she\u2019s willing to put her life on the line.\n\nThen you have villains that are very clear villains, like the Joker, who just derives pleasure from causing mayhem and destruction. So in that sense, yes, some heroes you could say are born, not made. Some people who are psychopaths appear to be born different\u2026 some research suggests that psychopaths have a biological underpinning that may, if not at birth, very early in life \u2014 there\u2019s no choice point.\n\nAnd then you have other villains, like Two-Face. In that story arc, it is at some point the person, instead of post-traumatic growth \u2014 again this is what the psychological literature says \u2014 in post-traumatic growth, people\u2019s worldview is challenged by trauma. Because the world is basically unpredictable and you can\u2019t always protect yourself, which is a really scary thought. To really get that is a terrifying thought, and we have to live knowing that. Some people, like superheroes who have a trauma history, make meaning by saying, \u201cI am going to do what I can either to prevent what happened to me from happening to other people or help people to whom this happened, the way I wish I had been helped.\u201d They find a silver lining in a horrible event and feel like \u201cOK, this happened for a reason,\u201d and the reason is for me to then help people in some way related to this. But sometimes, the message people get is that life is capricious, life is short, bad things can happen any moment: \u201cI\u2019m going to get whatever I can regardless of who I hurt.\u201d Then cynicism and greed can arrive. And this is also in real life, but that is the point at which the stories diverge between hero and villain.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Netflix is banking on \"Gotham,\" the Batman prequel, because it's a story they know we're craving", "title": "Why are we so obsessed with superhero origin stories?: Here\u2019s a psychologist\u2019s take", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Netflix is banking on \"Gotham,\" the Batman prequel, because it's a story they know we're craving", "title": "Why are we so obsessed with superhero origin stories?: Here\u2019s a psychologist\u2019s take", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/09/06/why_are_we_so_obsessed_with_superhero_origin_stories_heres_a_psychologists_take/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/gotham.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Netflix is banking on \"Gotham,\" the Batman prequel, because it's a story they know we're craving", "title": "Why are we so obsessed with superhero origin stories?: Here\u2019s a psychologist\u2019s take", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/gotham.jpg", "creator": "@prachigu", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Prachi Gupta", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Batman, gotham, origin stories, superheroes, villains", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: Batman, gotham, origin stories, superheroes, villains, Entertainment News, NewsThough it hasn\u2019t even premiered yet, Fox\u2019s upcoming series \u201cGotham\u201d has already made television history.\nWhy are we so obsessed with origin stories?\nHow do we psychologically treat heroes differently from villains in origin stories?\nAnd this is also in real life, but that is the point at which the stories diverge between hero and villain.\nSo in that context, whether he\u2019s a hero or a villain is all point of view."}
