The Senate was only in session for 65 days.\n\nThere have been 95 working days and only five public holidays in 2016, and considering the fact that every single representative is up for reelection this year, you can be certain that they've been spending their weekends and weeks off hustling campaign donations.\n\nAnd now the Republicans in Congress are earning their contributions from the trucking lobbying groups that have already given nearly $2 million to Republican candidates in 2016.\n\nWhat's even more insidious is that this rider is buried in a bill that includes funding for the VA along with much needed funding for Zika prevention.\n\nThat means that the Democrats and President Obama are left with the choice of either letting this rider pass -- endangering people on our public highways all over the country -- or risking being called out for playing political football in the face of a looming public health crisis.\n\nIt's time to get money out of politics so that our lawmakers actually spend their time carefully considering laws and getting public input before they vote.\n\nRolling back these trucking regulations will put every person who drives on our roads in danger, and the public is being completely blocked out of the lawmaking process.\n\nUntil we get money out of politics, we'll be stuck with a legislative agenda that places the wellbeing of special interests and corporate bottom lines over public interests and the common good.\n\nFor more information on how we can get money out of politics, check out Move to Amend.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/templates/ja_teline_iv_t3/images/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "description": "A must-pass spending measure would block the Obama administration from enforcing a regulation that caps truck drivers' hours at 70 per week.", "author": "The Daily Take Team", "og": {"site_name": "Truthout", "description": "A must-pass spending measure would block the Obama administration from enforcing a regulation that caps truck drivers' hours at 70 per week.", "title": "Why Is Congress Using Zika to Weaken Truck Safety?", "url": "http://www.truth-out.org/opinion/item/36111-why-is-congress-using-zika-to-weaken-truck-safety", "image": "http://www.truth-out.org/images/images_2016_05/2016_0519zika.jpg", "type": "non_profit"}, "title": "Why Is Congress Using Zika to Weaken Truck Safety?", "twitter": {"description": "A must-pass spending measure would block the Obama administration from enforcing a regulation that caps truck drivers' hours at 70 per week.", "title": "Why Is Congress Using Zika to Weaken Truck Safety?", "image": "http://www.truth-out.org/images/images_2016_05/2016_0519zika.jpg", "creator": "@truthout", "site": "@truthout", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "fb": {"app_id": 286391544774433}, "keywords": "truck drivers, safety, Zika, Politics and Elections, public safety, Transportation, Zika", "google-site-verification": "EfgVxcdUDBF_Dd81ZBBw_J8FuRjGnvp9r2JAM9IhvUk", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "YES", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1b0f\"", "article_summary": "Take truck driver Dana Logan, who recently told reporters the heartwrenching story about how she personally witnessed another truck driver fall asleep and ram an SUV from behind.\nWhen will the public get to weigh in on whether the truck drivers are allowed to work themselves to exhaustion and threaten public safety?\nThe truck driver who had fallen asleep and rammed the SUV managed to ask one last question before he died, simply \"Did I hit something?\"\nNearly 4,000 people die in large truck crashes each year, and driver fatigue is a leading factor according to the Department of Transportation.\nBoth the House and the Senate versions of this legislation would block the Obama administration from enforcing a regulation that requires workers to take two days in a row off per week, and caps truck drivers' hours at 70 a week."}
