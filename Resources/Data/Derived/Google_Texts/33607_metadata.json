Nothing too outrageous, just the kind of awkward run-ins with mentally unwell people that have long been part of living in this city (and have become harder to avoid as of late). If you live here long enough, you eventually become pretty inured to these moments; but they\u2019re still always a little sad.\n\nSometimes, though, they\u2019re not so much sad as they are scary. Far more often than not, people suffering from severe mental health issues are harmless. But that\u2019s not always the case. My partner, for example, recounted that once she accidentally \u2014 but very slightly \u2014 stepped on a woman\u2019s foot. She apologized, but for the rest of the time my partner was on the train, this woman was screaming at her. My partner knew it wasn\u2019t really about her, of course; but it was still a shitty experience.\n\nAfter she told me her story, I said, only half-kidding, \u201cThat happened to you because a lot of people in Tribeca and Lenox Hill don\u2019t want to pay more taxes to fund better mental health public services.\u201d I was being flip to some degree, but what I meant \u2014 and what I do believe \u2014 is that these kinds of systemic failures always have a cost. The question is whether it\u2019ll be paid by the affluent, in the form of taxes to fund public services, or by regular people, who have to experience, first-hand, the consequences of neglect.\n\nThe idea of \u201cnegative externalities,\u201d in other words, goes well beyond a carbon tax. It also matters to the welfare state. On the one hand, you have fossil fuel companies that want others to pay for climate change\u2019s damages. On the other, you have \u201csmall government\u201d types who want others to pay for the results a threadbare safety net. Nations that can\u2019t afford to build seawalls watch ocean levels rise with horror, while those who can\u2019t afford taxis or a driver are berated by impoverished and unbalanced strangers on the train.\n\nIt\u2019s hard not to think of that broken dynamic while reading about the possibly criminal negligence that\u2019s caused the rate of lead poisoning among children in Flint, Michigan, to double in just a few years, and forced the state\u2019s Republican governor, Rick Snyder, to declare a state of emergency. The poisoning was the result of decisions made by the \u201cemergency managers\u201d Snyder dispatched to run the near-bankrupt Flint. And as Vox\u2019s Libby Nelson recounts, their goal was to save money:\n\nFlint, under the control of a state-appointed emergency manager, decided to save money on water. It had been purchasing water from Detroit, but costs had been climbing even as Flint\u2019s population fell. In 2013, the city decided to join a new, regional water system that, like Detroit, drew water from Lake Huron. The switch would save millions of dollars per year. The problem was that the regional water system wasn\u2019t yet built, and Flint wanted to start getting its water from somewhere other than Detroit right away. So the city started taking its water directly from the Flint River in 2014 \u2014 celebrating its break from Detroit with a countdown and a toast, Michigan Radio reported.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The heinous lead-poisoning scandal that's shaking Michigan politics offers a glimpse of the true cost of austerity", "title": "When money matters more than lives: The poisonous cost of austerity in Flint, Michigan", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The heinous lead-poisoning scandal that's shaking Michigan politics offers a glimpse of the true cost of austerity", "title": "When money matters more than lives: The poisonous cost of austerity in Flint, Michigan", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/01/09/when_money_matters_more_than_lives_the_poisonous_cost_of_austerity_in_flint_michigan/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/01/michigan_water.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The heinous lead-poisoning scandal that's shaking Michigan politics offers a glimpse of the true cost of austerity", "title": "When money matters more than lives: The poisonous cost of austerity in Flint, Michigan", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/01/michigan_water.jpg", "creator": "@eliasisquith", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Elias Isquith", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, aol_on, Austerity, Class warfare, Editor's Picks, flint, Inequality, lead poisoning, libby nelson, Michigan, One Tough Nerd, Rick Snyder", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "In 2013, the city decided to join a new, regional water system that, like Detroit, drew water from Lake Huron.\nThe problem was that the regional water system wasn\u2019t yet built, and Flint wanted to start getting its water from somewhere other than Detroit right away.\nThe poisoning was the result of decisions made by the \u201cemergency managers\u201d Snyder dispatched to run the near-bankrupt Flint.\nSo the city started taking its water directly from the Flint River in 2014 \u2014 celebrating its break from Detroit with a countdown and a toast, Michigan Radio reported.\nIt had been purchasing water from Detroit, but costs had been climbing even as Flint\u2019s population fell."}
