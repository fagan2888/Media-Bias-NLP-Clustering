A nurse accused of masturbating at the bedside of a female patient has been arrested and suspended by the Sarasota rehabilitation hospital where he worked for five months, the Sarasota Herald-Tribune reports.

It’s not the first time Sean Golden has been accused of this type of crime: the Sarasota County Sheriff’s Office arrest report notes the Florida Department of Health is investigating allegations of three other similar incidents that happened while he was working at another hospital, the Herald-Tribune reports. Administrators at his most recent employer, Complex Care Hospital at Ridgelake, did not say if they knew of the other allegations, according to the Herald-Tribune.

Meantime, in a separate case, a caretaker in Royal Palm Beach is accused of stealing $850,000 from a 77-year-old man with dementia, the South Florida Sun Sentinel reports. The arrest came after a tip from a neighbor, who grew suspicious when Isabelle Schillo, 57, started driving a new Porsche Panamera instead of her late model Oldsmobile. Investigators say the man’s home was in “deplorable” conditions. Schillo denies any wrongdoing, the Sun Sentinel reports.
