(Reuters)\n\nPresident Obama said failure to pass Trade Adjustment Assistance will eliminate benefits for as many as 100,000 American workers. (Reuters)\n\nCheers rang out Thursday evening when President Obama made a surprise visit to the annual congressional baseball game at National Park. Thousands of Democratic staffers began to chant: \u201cO-ba-ma! O-ba-ma!\u201d More unexpectedly, Republican lawmakers and staffers, who have been locked in battle with the president for more than six years, began a cheer of their own: \u201cTPA, TPA!\u201d they chanted, voicing approval for Obama\u2019s trade promotion agenda.\n\nObama flashed the GOP side a thumbs up.\n\nInside the Democratic dugout, according to several senior aides and lawmakers, the president\u2019s usual allies were appalled by the scene: He was waving to Republicans in approval of trade legislation that most of them opposed.\n\nA day later, the Democratic team threw the president a curveball by blocking his high-stakes bid to win fast-track authority to complete a sweeping, multinational Pacific Rim free-trade accord. For Obama, who has staked enormous personal credibility and political capital on the effort, the loss on Friday represented a major setback on a key presidential priority and renewed questions in Washington about his relationship with the House Democratic caucus.\n\nThough the White House and GOP leaders quickly vowed to try again on trade next week, the rebuke from the president\u2019s own party \u2014 despite a personal plea from Obama on Capitol Hill just hours before the vote \u2014 sent a clear message that their own skepticism on trade trumped their faith in Obama. The blow left his trade agenda on life support.\n\nThe White House dismissed the defeat of President Obama's Pacific Rim free trade initiative as \"another procedural SNAFU\" in Congress. (Reuters)\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, Democrats did not heed his message,\u201d said Rep. Gerald E. Connolly (D-Va.), who supported the trade deal. \u201cTrade is an existential issue for a lot of Democrats. That transcends everything, including loyalty to him. A lot of Democrats were really anguished about that very choice. They were saying: \u2018I don\u2019t want to harm him. I don\u2019t want to damage him. But I can\u2019t go home to my district and say that out of loyalty to him, \u201cI sold you all [out].\u201d \u2019 \u201d\n\nThe outcome was especially frustrating for a president who has spent four years unable to advance major initiatives \u2014 including a tax and budget \u201cgrand bargain,\u201d stricter gun control and immigration reform \u2014 through Congress in the face of relentless Republican opposition.\n\nAfter the midterm elections, Obama and his advisers gambled that with the GOP in control of both chambers for the next two years, the scrambled politics of trade would offer the president his best chance to score a legacy-building win in the final stretch of his tenure. Assuming that he could persuade more than a sliver of his own party to support him.\n\nHe faced significant odds: Democrats have long been skeptical of the effects of trade, which labor unions have blamed for lost jobs and falling wages in traditional, blue-collar manufacturing sectors.\n\nThe president launched an\n\nadministration-wide lobbying effort that lasted months and, by virtually all accounts, was more exhaustive and personal than any push he has made since the effort to reform health care in his first year. He phoned and met with key Democratic lawmakers, promised to campaign for them against primary challenges and invited them aboard Air Force One for a trip to a European summit. He traveled to Oregon in May to give a trade speech at Nike in the home state of Sen. Ron Wyden (D), who offered crucial support to help win passage of the fast-track legislation in the Senate.\n\n\u201cThe president is personally engaged on this,\u201d Wyden said of Obama on Thursday. \u201cHe\u2019s all in.\u201d\n\nBut his surprise appearance at the congressional baseball game \u2014 the presidential motorcade departed the White House after aides had declared he was in for the night \u2014 betrayed the confident tone from administration officials on the eve of the House vote.\n\nThe House of Representatives has blocked legislation to \"fast-track\" trade deals through Congress, dealing a big blow to President Obama (Reuters)\n\nDuring his tenure, Obama has been criticized by both sides of the aisle for ignoring lawmakers, courting them only when absolutely necessary and failing to establish personal connections that could help him politically.\n\nThat the president was attending an exhibition game that was not on his public schedule showed the lengths he felt he had to go to try to salvage his trade deal.\n\nBy Friday morning, however, the vote remained in doubt \u2014 and Obama was leaving the White House on another scheduled trip, this time to Capitol Hill for an emergency meeting with the House Democratic caucus. Once there, he huddled privately with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi\n\n(D-Calif.) and her deputies, before addressing the entire membership.\n\n\u201cYou could always say there coulda, shoulda been more with any president,\u201d Connolly said, when asked if Obama\u2019s lack of attention to lawmakers over the years harmed his chances on trade. \u201cThis president\u2019s style is different than Bill Clinton\u2019s. He is who he is. I don\u2019t know if somehow it\u2019s fundamentally flawed. It\u2019s just different.\u201d\n\nMost in Congress agree on one thing: The administration, despite its blitz in recent weeks, was facing an opposition, made up of labor unions, environmentalists and progressive Democrats, that has been relentless in lobbying against trade. Led by Rep. Rosa L. DeLauro (D-Conn.), the coalition has met with individual Democrats and with small groups for more than two years to pressure them to oppose any fast-track bill.\n\nAsked by reporters after the vote whether Obama\u2019s trade push came too late, White House press secretary Josh Earnest scoffed.\n\n\u201cI find it hard to believe that the president\u2019s attendance at the 2014 congressional baseball game would have, in any way, contributed to the vote count today,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that the president takes much more seriously members of Congress and their concerns than some analysts do.\u201d\n\nBut Obama appeared to be blindsided by Pelosi, who said months ago, during a fact-finding mission to Asia with other lawmakers, that she was \u201ctrying to get to yes\u201d on the president\u2019s trade deal. In 2009 and 2010, Obama leaned heavily on her, when she was the House speaker, to help wrestle the Affordable Care Act through Congress with Democratic majorities on a party-line vote.\n\nAs the trade vote neared, Pelosi refused to tip her hand, although she appeared to be working with Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) to schedule a package of related trade bills in such a way as to help them pass the House, even if she didn\u2019t support them. On Friday, taking the floor minutes before the vote, Pelosi broke her silence: \u201cI will be voting to slow down fast-track,\u201d she declared. \u201cToday, we have an opportunity to slow down. Whatever the deal is with other countries, we want a better deal for American workers.\u201d\n\nIt was a fatal blow for Obama, and supportive Democrats were stunned.\n\n\u201cShe screwed this president,\u201d one lawmaker fumed, speaking on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retaliation. \u201cShe pandered to the left. She does not ever want to be outflanked by the left, because that\u2019s her base.\u201d\n\nThe minority leader had heeded her center of power, while the president was left wondering where his had gone.\n\nKelsey Snell contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The rebuke from the president\u2019s own party on a Pacific Rim accord left his trade agenda on life support.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/paul.kane.3367", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The rebuke from the president\u2019s own party on a Pacific Rim accord left his trade agenda on life support.", "title": "New questions arise about House Democratic caucus\u2019s loyalty to Obama", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/obama-takes-one-on-the-chin-from-his-own-party-on-trade-bill/2015/06/12/d1aa7da6-1126-11e5-9726-49d6fa26a8c6_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/06/12/National-Politics/Images/2015-06-12T151150Z_01_WASC201_RTRIDSP_3_USA-TRADE-OBAMA.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@pkcapitol"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/obama-takes-one-on-the-chin-from-his-own-party-on-trade-bill/2015/06/12/d1aa7da6-1126-11e5-9726-49d6fa26a8c6_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "tpa, trade, obama", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/paul.kane.3367"}, "eomportal-uuid": "d1aa7da6-1126-11e5-9726-49d6fa26a8c6", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "tpa, trade, obama"}, "article_summary": "(Reuters)Cheers rang out Thursday evening when President Obama made a surprise visit to the annual congressional baseball game at National Park.\nPresident Obama said failure to pass Trade Adjustment Assistance will eliminate benefits for as many as 100,000 American workers.\nBy Friday morning, however, the vote remained in doubt \u2014 and Obama was leaving the White House on another scheduled trip, this time to Capitol Hill for an emergency meeting with the House Democratic caucus.\nThe White House dismissed the defeat of President Obama's Pacific Rim free trade initiative as \"another procedural SNAFU\" in Congress.\nAsked by reporters after the vote whether Obama\u2019s trade push came too late, White House press secretary Josh Earnest scoffed."}
