But the Hawaii Health Connector doesn\u2019t have enough money for its operations.\n\nThat leaves the exchange vulnerable to a partial federal takeover, a risk lawmakers say they\u2019re not willing to take.\n\nJeff Kissel, CEO of the Hawaii Health Connector, had wanted to issue $28 million in state-backed bonds or loans, but that proposal fizzled after the Department of Budget and Finance expressed concerns about backing the exchange.\n\n\u201cIt would have been the first time for a nonstate agency that we would guarantee whatever was issued, so there would be a lot of issues,\u201d said Wes Machida, director of finance. \u201cWe would prefer the general fund subsidy at this point.\u201d\n\nNow lawmakers are considering a $5 million cash infusion from the state\u2019s general fund, said Rep. Angus McKelvey, co-chairman of the conference committee working out the details on SB 1028.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way that Budget and Finance could come up with a mechanism at this point in time, so we\u2019re better off to just go back to what we did last year, which is a general fund appropriation,\u201d McKelvey said.\n\nThe state approved $1.5 million in general funds to keep the exchange going last year.\n\nKissel has said the exchange could become profitable by 2022, but it would need up to $28 million for operations between now and then. The path to sustainability relies on enrollment targets, which the exchange has exceeded so far this year.\n\nLawmakers discussed the bills related to the sustainability of the exchange in a conference committee Thursday and deferred further action until Monday morning.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Honolulu Star-Advertiser", "description": "Hawaii lawmakers are looking for ways to prop up the state\u2019s financially struggling health exchange, and they\u2019re considering cash from the general fund.", "title": "Lawmakers consider $5 million infusion for Hawaii Health Connector | Honolulu Star-Advertiser", "url": "http://www.staradvertiser.com/business/lawmakers-consider-5-million-infusion-for-hawaii-health-connector/", "image": "http://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/20141217_biz_healthconnector6.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/staradvertiser/", "section": "Business", "tag": "news", "published_time": "2015-04-23T11:34:32-10:00"}, "fb": {"pages": 112299605447935}, "twitter": {"description": "Hawaii lawmakers are looking for ways to prop up the state\u2019s financially struggling health exchange, and they\u2019re considering cash from the general fund.", "creator": "@staradvertiser", "image": "http://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/20141217_biz_healthconnector6.jpg", "title": "Lawmakers consider $5 million infusion for Hawaii Health Connector | Honolulu Star-Advertiser", "site": "@staradvertiser", "card": "summary"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Lawmakers consider $5 million infusion for Hawaii Health ConnectorHawaii lawmakers are looking for ways to prop up the state\u2019s financially struggling health exchange, and they\u2019re considering cash from the general fund.\nBut the Hawaii Health Connector doesn\u2019t have enough money for its operations.\n\u201cWe would prefer the general fund subsidy at this point.\u201dNow lawmakers are considering a $5 million cash infusion from the state\u2019s general fund, said Rep.
