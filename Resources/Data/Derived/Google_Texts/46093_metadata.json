For large companies, costs will rise this year by an average of 4.4 percent. While that\u2019s higher than the 2013 rate of 4.1 percent, it remains a historically low figure (see chart below). The popular notion that health-care costs are spinning wildly out of control is, today, a fiction, at least for large companies.\n\nThe underlying cost trend for this year is actually an increase of 7 percent, according to the survey, which included responses from 595 companies with at least 1,000 employees. But the average large company will bring that down to the 4.4 percent level by taking steps like redesigning its plans (for example, increasing employees\u2019 deductibles and copayments) and lowering plan contributions. The share of costs borne by employees, including premiums and out-of-pocket costs, has inched up from 34.4 percent in 2011 to 37 percent this year, the survey report notes.\n\nThis year\u2019s minimal acceleration in corporate cost growth carries a caveat: much or all of it may be attributable to some costs related to the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The big one is the new transitional reinsurance tax meant to defray the government\u2019s costs of setting up and subsidizing the new public health-insurance exchanges. In 2014 all companies (both self-funded and fully insured ones) will pay $63 for every employee and dependent covered under an employer-sponsored health plan.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a significant expense for a large employer and may account for a one-half percentage-point increase in cost growth,\u201d says Randall Abbott, a senior health-care consultant with Towers Watson. Also, after a phase-out schedule that started in 2010, this will be the first year there can be no annual or lifetime dollar limits under health-insurance policies.\n\nAt 4.4 percent, health-care cost hikes are well more than double the current inflation rate of about 1.6 percent. That\u2019s hardly a new trend. \u201cFor the last 30 to 40 years, health costs have always run about two to two-and-a-half times the rate of general inflation,\u201d says Abbott. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll see the medical [cost] trend nearing the inflation rate anytime in the near future.\u201d\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean individual companies can\u2019t get there. According to the survey report, \u201cbest-performing\u201d companies, defined as those that maintained cost increases at or below the medians in the annual NBGH/Towers Watson surveys for four consecutive years, saw such increases average just 1.6 percent from 2010 through 2013.\n\nSome such companies are supersized and wield immense negotiating leverage. But smaller employers in the 1,000-and-over category, and some even smaller than that, may increasingly have access to cost-saving avenues laid out by the same Affordable Care Act that doled out new fees and costs over the past few years. If the ACA has taken something away, over time it may give back more.\n\n\u201cThis is a really important point for CFOs,\u201d says Abbott. \u201cThe ACA legislated the availability of five new reimbursement methods for providers of care like doctors and hospitals. They are value-based. Rather than paying just a discounted unit cost for care delivered, they modify payments based on the efficiency of care, quality of care and patient outcomes.\u201d\n\nThese payment models were initially aimed at the Medicare market but are now being expanded into the commercial marketplace. Right now, only about 10 percent to 20 percent of reimbursements under most employer plans are value-based, says Abbott. But that number is increasing rapidly, and Towers Watson estimates that by 2015 it will be as much as 30 percent to 35 percent.\n\n\u201cThis is a big part of health-care reform,\u201d says Abbott. \u201cIt heralds a shift from a pure discount reimbursement arrangement, where CFOs\u2019 focus is all on what discounts they can get from health plans and providers. Going forward, you can lean toward giving your business to the plans and providers that are embracing and pursing the new payment methods.\u201d\n\nIn looking at various health-plan options, CFOs should insist on getting complete answers to \u201chow your efficiency influences the contracting rate, how you\u2019re monitoring outcomes, how you\u2019re managing quality and how providers are recognized and rewarded for doing those things.\u201d\n\nHere are some other notable survey findings:\n\n\u2022 While 95 percent of respondents reported that their health-benefits plans are an important part of their total rewards value proposition for employees, only 25 percent said they were \u201cconfident\u201d their companies will offer employee health coverage in 10 years.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the lowest that number has ever been, but if you think about the current landscape it\u2019s not very surprising,\u201d says Abbott. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen with legislation, or with the excise tax [slated to be imposed on employers with too-rich plans starting in 2018], or with employers\u2019 tax deductions for health care as the government faces budget challenges, or how successful the public exchanges will ultimately be, or how these new private exchanges are going to fall out.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Companies continue to discourage spouses from signing up for health insurance. This year 49 percent of survey respondents said their employers charge more per person for dependent coverage than employee-only coverage, and an additional 15 percent plan to do so in 2015. Also, 24 percent of survey participants assess an enrollment surcharge against spouses who have access to other employer-based coverage, and 15 percent more expect to do so next year.\n\n\u201cThe cost of covering spouses is significant, and employers have been reconciling their premium allocations against true claims costs to make sure they\u2019re covering the spouse costs,\u201d says Abbott.\n\n\u2022 Adoption of outcomes-based wellness incentives is gaining steam, and fast. For 2014, 22 percent of the surveyed companies stipulated that financial and other incentives be based on more than simply participation in a wellness program. That number is expected to reach 46 percent next year.\n\n\u201cHistorically employers have expected very little accountability from their employees when it comes to wellness programs,\u201d Abbott says. \u201cThe outcomes-based approach says, \u2018To get the money, you\u2019ve got to demonstrate that you\u2019re achieving results \u2014 that you are actually losing weight or stopped smoking or reduced your cholesterol.\u2019 That is a step in the right direction.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "health-care cost trend, medical trend, national business group on health, nbgh, towers watson", "generator": "Easy Digital Downloads v2.2.2", "author": "David McCann", "og": {"site_name": "CFO", "description": "The average company with 1,000-plus workers will pay just 2.4% more for health benefits in 2014, says Towers Watson and National Business Group on Health.", "title": "Health-Care Cost Hikes Stay Modest for Big Companies", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.cfo.com/content/uploads/2014/03/478394023.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-05-19T11:52:02+00:00", "url": "http://ww2.cfo.com/health-benefits/2014/03/health-care-cost-hikes-stay-modest-big-companies/", "type": "article"}, "media": "Article", "twitter": {"domain": "CFO", "description": "The average company with 1,000-plus workers will pay just 2.4% more for health benefits in 2014, says Towers Watson and National Business Group on Health.", "creator": "@cfo", "title": "Health-Care Cost Hikes Stay Modest for Big Companies", "site": "@cfo", "card": "summary", "account_id": 44906914}, "topicRoot": "Human Capital & Careers", "topic": "Health Benefits", "headline": "Health-Care Cost Hikes Stay Modest for Big Companies", "fb": {"admins": 15609421}, "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Health-Care Cost Hikes Stay Modest for Big Companies\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.cfo.com\\/health-benefits\\/2014\\/03\\/health-care-cost-hikes-stay-modest-big-companies\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-03-07 14:25:58\",\"mod_date\":\"2014-05-19 11:52:02\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":83366,\"author_id\":\"6\",\"author_name\":null,\"author_display_name\":\"David McCann\",\"tags\":[\"health-care cost trend\",\"medical trend\",\"National Business Group on Health\",\"NBGH\",\"Towers Watson\"],\"categories\":[\"Corporate Finance\",\"Health Benefits\",\"Human Capital &amp; Careers\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/cdn.cfo.com\\/content\\/uploads\\/2014\\/03\\/478394023.jpg\"}", "date": 20140307, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CFOConferences", "section": "Human Capital & Careers", "tag": "Towers Watson", "published_time": "2014-03-07T14:25:58+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-05-19T11:52:02+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "The average company with 1,000-plus workers will pay just 2.4% more for health benefits in 2014, says Towers Watson and National Business Group on Health."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb8c0\"", "article_summary": "For large companies, costs will rise this year by an average of 4.4 percent.\nAt 4.4 percent, health-care cost hikes are well more than double the current inflation rate of about 1.6 percent.\nThe popular notion that health-care costs are spinning wildly out of control is, today, a fiction, at least for large companies.\nThe rate of increase in large employers\u2019 health-care costs is expected to tick up slightly in 2014, ending a four-year slowdown in cost growth.\n\u201cIt heralds a shift from a pure discount reimbursement arrangement, where CFOs\u2019 focus is all on what discounts they can get from health plans and providers."}
