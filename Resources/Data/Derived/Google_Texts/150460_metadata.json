While this might seem a failure on the part of the Veterans Administration, there are likely bigger cultural issues at play.\n\nI have spent the past three years talking to American soldiers and their families.\n\nI approached this topic as a novelist, but also as the sister of a combat veteran who\u2019s had a 30-year career in the Army. The more I learned about life after combat, the more I realized the power of one particularly dehumanizing and often paralyzing word: hero.\n\nWhat\u2019s so bad about being called a hero? It sounds like praise, but it can be dangerously dismissive. The problem is that \u201chero\u201d refers to a character, a protagonist, something in fiction, not to a person, and using this word can hurt the very people it\u2019s meant to laud. While meant to create a sense of honor, it can also buy silence, prevent discourse and benefit those in power more than those navigating the new terrain of home after combat. If you are a hero, part of your character is stoic sacrifice, silence. This makes it difficult for others to see you as flawed, human, vulnerable or exploited. And it makes it even more difficult for you to reach out when you need help.\n\nHomecoming is never simple. Soldiers often return to a variety of challenges including health, financial and marital issues. One in three American soldiers suffers from PTSD after returning from deployment. Fifty-five percent of women and 38 percent of men report being sexually harassed while in the military; 20 percent of soldiers turn to heavy drinking and drug use upon return. Being turned into a fictive symbol is little consolation for the weight of physical and psychological injury these people incur. According to the Bureau of Veterans Affairs, 22 veterans a day kill themselves, nearly one person an hour. For active duty soldiers it\u2019s about one a day, significantly more than have died in combat in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nIt\u2019s important to remember that PTSD affects exponentially more people than just the soldiers who experience it. It affects everyone in their families, their friends, their coworkers. Whole communities deal with the complicated effects of homecoming. With the end of military operations, we\u2019re all feeling the weight of return, and that weight will not be lightened by using words like \u201chero\u201d as a consolation prize to gloss over the very human cost of war.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"Hero\" sounds like praise, but it's not: It glosses over the human cost of war, and keeps us from helping our vets", "title": "Stop calling soldiers \u201cheroes\u201d: It stops us from seeing them as human \u2014 and dismisses their experience", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "\"Hero\" sounds like praise, but it's not: It glosses over the human cost of war, and keeps us from helping our vets", "title": "Stop calling soldiers \u201cheroes\u201d: It stops us from seeing them as human \u2014 and dismisses their experience", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/07/20/stop_calling_soldiers_heroes_it_stops_us_from_seeing_them_as_human_and_dismisses_their_experience/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/act_of_valor.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"Hero\" sounds like praise, but it's not: It glosses over the human cost of war, and keeps us from helping our vets", "title": "Stop calling soldiers \u201cheroes\u201d: It stops us from seeing them as human \u2014 and dismisses their experience", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/act_of_valor.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Cara Hoffman", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Books, Cara Hoffman, Editor's Picks, Military, Stop calling solidiers heroes, veterans, veterans administration", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The more I learned about life after combat, the more I realized the power of one particularly dehumanizing and often paralyzing word: hero.\nTopics: Books, Cara Hoffman, Editor's Picks, Military, Stop calling solidiers heroes, veterans, veterans administration, Life NewsLast month the Institute of Medicine released a study showing that only half the Veterans with PTSD are getting treatment for the condition.\nIt\u2019s important to remember that PTSD affects exponentially more people than just the soldiers who experience it.\nFor active duty soldiers it\u2019s about one a day, significantly more than have died in combat in Iraq and Afghanistan.\nSoldiers often return to a variety of challenges including health, financial and marital issues."}
