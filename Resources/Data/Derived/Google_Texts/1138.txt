Wichita police are looking for a suspect on the loose after kidnapping a woman and holding her hostage inside a Wichita home.

Police say the woman reported escaping from a home near 27th and Meridian on Saturday after being held against her will.

Dozens of officers arrived on scene after the woman told police she had been tied up by a man inside the home. Police and a SWAT team surrounded and entered the home to find the suspect was not inside.

"We had our swat team out here, they cleared the residence, there was no one inside the residence after their tactical investigation so we are still looking for our suspect," said Captain Doug Nolte with the Wichita Police Department.

It was a quite a Halloween night for those who live on 27th St W. While the search was active, some neighboring residents were asked to leave their homes while the SWAT team entered. Residents were allowed to go back inside around 9:00 p.m. when the home search was complete.

Police say they are actively searching for the suspect. Captain Nolte did not provide a description of the male suspect.
