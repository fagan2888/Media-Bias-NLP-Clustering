LOUIS \u2014 Denver Broncos, meet the other half.\n\nThis is how defenses play on teams which don\u2019t possess an elite quarterback. The margin for error is thinner than Flat Stanley, simple mistakes magnified.\n\nThe Broncos\u2019 defense accepted blame for the 22-7 loss Sunday, even if the unit was the only reason Denver had a pulse through three quarters. The Broncos limited St. Louis to three field goals in three red zone appearances.\n\nBut it was a long passthat haunted Denver. Peyton Manning threw incomplete to Emmanuel Sanders on fourth-and-5 from the Rams\u2019 37-yard line in the first quarter. A crowd splashed with orange suddenly turned loud for the home team. The Rams pounced. Former starter, former backup, current starter Shaun Hill dropped back and delivered a 63-yard scoring strike to Kenny Britt, making it 10-0 and leaving Denver scrambling, fully aware it was going to be in a physical brawl.\n\nBritt beat nickel cornerback Bradley Roby, who dived in an attempt to deflect the pass. Britt finished with 128 yards on four receptions. The Broncos insisted that Britt didn\u2019t surprise them.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not dangerous,\u201d cornerback Chris Harris said. \u201cHe just made a couple of plays.\u201d\n\nHarris drew the assignment of taking out Tavon Austin. One of the NFL\u2019s fastest players, Austin finished with two catches for 10 yards. The Britt play stung because it represented one of the Broncos\u2019 few mistakes in coverage. At least according to Hill, who replaced Austin Davis, who was benched because of his propensity to commit turnovers.\n\n\u201cI just saw the safety come right, driving on Tavon,\u201d Hill said. \u201cI saw Kenny\u2019s angle and launched it. He ran right under it. Obviously, Kenny\u2019s got a great skill set. He had an opportunity to use Tavon as a decoy to get open.\u201d\n\nOn the Rams\u2019 first drive, Britt raced behind Aqib Talib on a 33-yard gain. It might have been a touchdown had Hill not thrown the ball behind Britt.\n\nWhat hurt the Broncos\u2019 defense was its inability to get off the field. Tre Mason became the first player to rush for 100 yards on Denver this season. St. Louis held the ball for 35 minutes, 50 seconds. The Broncos\u2019 defense showed elasticity on a day when the opposing defense already was ripping at the seams.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve just got to tighten the screws up as a team. We didn\u2019t play well on either side of the ball,\u201d defensive tackle Terrance Knighton said. \u201cWe did hold them to five field goals, but in a game like this on the road you\u2019ve got to find a way to spark the team. We could have created turnovers to change momentum, and we didn\u2019t.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Kenny Britt\u2019s big play for Rams haunts Broncos\u2019 defense", "title": "Kenny Britt\u2019s big play for Rams haunts Broncos\u2019 defense", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/11/16/kenny-britts-big-play-for-rams-haunts-broncos-defense/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141116__SP16FBNbroncos_JA33147ap1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141116__SP16FBNbroncos_JA33147ap1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-16T18:09:42+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T16:11:23+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The Broncos\u2019 defense showed elasticity on a day when the opposing defense already was ripping at the seams.\nThe Broncos\u2019 defense accepted blame for the 22-7 loss Sunday, even if the unit was the only reason Denver had a pulse through three quarters.\nWhat hurt the Broncos\u2019 defense was its inability to get off the field.\nST.
