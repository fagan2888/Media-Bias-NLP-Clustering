Out of chapter 11, the new brand would focus on online sales. Tamara Mellon-brand items are now sold at small boutiques and high-end department stores like Neiman Marcus, Saks Fifth Avenue and Nordstrom, according to its website.\n\nMs. Mellon, once called the \u201cfirst lady of footwear, founded the company in November 2013. Company officials use a supply chain model that enables them to respond to trends quickly thanks to shorter manufacturing times and to \u201cdeliver its products direct to customers without the manacles of the traditional, rigid fashion calendar,\u201d according to documents filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Del.\n\nUnder the new model, a shoe with a luxury fashion label that costs more than $800 would be priced closer to $450, court papers said. The vision was described in bankruptcy-court papers:\n\nWhereas traditional fashion labels release their collections months in advance of the wearing season (for example, showing fall runway collections in the spring), [the company] targets a \u201cshop now, wear now\u201d model where new collections debut in the season they are meant to be worn. This season-relevant approach reduces the risk associated with the vagaries of forecasting fickle fashion trends months before they happen-reducing the potential for obsolete or unwanted inventory, and cutting the amount of items that need to be sold off price.\n\nBut company officials realized a year into the business that they needed more money to \u201cwork through its initial seasons\u201d to eventually profit. Finding that money was a struggle, court papers said.\n\nThe company owes more than $4 million to investors and Ms. Mellon.\n\n\u201cWe will use this brief period of reorganization so we can position ourselves to take advantage of our new growth strategy and ensure the long term vibrancy of our brand,\u201d Ms. Mellon said in a statement.\n\nThe bankruptcy is designed to give the retailer access to $12 million from investors, both new and old. Of that amount, $10 million will come from an affiliate of New Enterprise Associates, one of the venture capital industry\u2019s leading fundraisers.\n\nIn exchange, the New Enterprise Associates affiliate will get more than 30% of the company\u2019s shares. Ms. Mellon will remain a shareholder, controlling more than 10% of shares while getting options and warrants on top of that, court papers said.\n\nThe plan\u2019s fine print makes it clear that company lawyers will have the power to sue J. Choo USA Inc. after the bankruptcy concludes. Court papers didn\u2019t say why the company would sue Ms. Mellon\u2019s ex-employer, but since her departure in 2011 with a reported payout of $135 million, she hasn\u2019t been shy about sharing her frustrations about her old job.\n\nIn 2013, Ms. Mellon called Mr. Choo \u201ca cobbler\u201d on the Today show, taking the credit for designing shoes that symbolized trendiness and indulgence on Sex and the City.\n\nEarlier this year, a letter surfaced that accused her former employer of telling luxury shoemakers in Florence, Italy, not to work with Ms. Mellon. A representative for Choo told a Page Six reporter that the complaint \u201chas no merit and will be vigorously contested.\u201d\n\nWrite to Katy Stech at katy.stech@wsj.com.
