John Hickenlooper on Friday announced the distribution of $2.29 million in grants, approved July 16 by state water officials, for 19 new stream projects in Boulder, Larimer, Weld and Jefferson counties.\n\n\u201cQuickly and strategically rehabilitating streams damaged by the flood is critical for many reasons \u2014 most notably so that we are prepared to endure any future surprises Mother Nature might throw our way,\u201d a statement from Hickenlooper\u2019s office said.\n\nThe projects are designed to reduce future flood risk and shore up stream banks, wildlife habitat, agricultural areas and recreational opportunities.\n\nSevere flooding due to heavy rain last fall affected 24 counties. Flooding triggered failures of nine dams and damaged or destroyed nearly 225 water diversion structures. An estimated 32,000 acres of croplands were damaged, and state officials say they lost $540,000 in state-owned stream-gauge equipment.\n\nThe grants, created under recent legislation, reimburse up to half of eligible expenses in cleaning up debris and restoring watersheds.\n\nThe legislation authorizes payments to private entities and people whose property was affected as well as local governments, watershed coalitions and other nonprofit groups engaged in restoration work.\n\nBruce Finley: 303-954-1700, bfinley@denverpost.com or twitter.com/finleybruce\n\nProjects and funding\n\nNorth Fork of the Big Thompson River Restoration, $196,500\n\nBoulder Creek Confluence Restoration, $200,000\n\nMulti-basin Riparian Restoration and Plant Propagation Program, $200,000\n\nLeft Hand Creek Restoration, $200,000\n\nEstes Park Fish Creek Restoration Project: Brook Drive to Country Club Reach, $200,000\n\nBoulder County Fourmile Creek Restoration Project, $80,000\n\nLongmont Peschel-St. Vrain Creek Restoration, $110,000\n\nBoulder County South St. Vrain Creek Restoration at Hall Ranch, $110,000\n\nGreeley/Larimer County Lions Open Space Eastern Bank Restoration Project, $150,000\n\nCoal Creek Canyon Restoration Project: Twin Spruce Junction, $94,400\n\nBig Thompson River Restoration, $300,000\n\nSylvan Dale Ranch Fish Habitat Design and Debris Removal on Big Thompson River, $59,850\n\nLittle Thompson River Urgent Needs, $170,625\n\nRiparian Habitation Restoration, Stream Bank Revegetation and Beaver Reintroduction on Highland Placer, South St. Vrain Watershed, Boulder County, $14,000\n\nLefthand Creek Streambed and Bank Stabilization, Riparian Corridor Restoration, $20,000\n\nLogan Mill Ranch Tree Farm Sunbeam Gulch Stream Restoration Project, $20,000\n\nLyons Lower McConnell Hazard Mitigation Project, $56,250\n\nDebris Removal from Left Hand Creek Water Intake, $9,030", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado moves on flood debris removal, watershed restoration", "title": "Colorado moves on flood debris removal, watershed restoration", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/08/colorado-moves-on-flood-debris-removal-watershed-restoration/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140808__20130916__hygeine_colorado_flooding_property_damagep1-1p1.jpg", "height": 400}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140808__20130916__hygeine_colorado_flooding_property_damagep1-1p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-08T11:20:05+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T11:40:57+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd0a0\"", "article_summary": "Colorado is moving ahead on projects to restore stream banks and other watershed areas hit by floods.\nThe projects are designed to reduce future flood risk and shore up stream banks, wildlife habitat, agricultural areas and recreational opportunities.\nThe grants, created under recent legislation, reimburse up to half of eligible expenses in cleaning up debris and restoring watersheds.\nThe legislation authorizes payments to private entities and people whose property was affected as well as local governments, watershed coalitions and other nonprofit groups engaged in restoration work.\nAn estimated 32,000 acres of croplands were damaged, and state officials say they lost $540,000 in state-owned stream-gauge equipment."}
