As part of Salon’s expansion on to emerging platforms, I am proud to announce the launch of the Salon app for Apple Watch. The app extends our fearless journalism, breaking news, analysis and opinion to an even more personalized experience on an exciting new content platform.

The Salon app for Apple Watch will display headlines from the top stories on Salon, allowing users to instantly and discretely follow important stories throughout their day. When users tap on articles, they will load on Salon’s companion app for iPhone. Salon’s app for Apple Watch also includes a “Save for Later” feature that users can activate by holding their finger down on a article – adding it to a bookmarked list accessible via the Salon iOS app.
