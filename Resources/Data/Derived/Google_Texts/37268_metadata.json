The legislation would amend the way the state defines \u201cdomicile\u201d to require that a voter reside in the Granite State for \u201cno less than 30 consecutive days\u201d before they become eligible to cast a ballot.\n\nSupporters argue that a residency requirement would reduce voter fraud.\n\nThe New Hampshire Republican Party has launched a petition in support of the legislation.\n\nJennifer Horn, the chairman of the New Hampshire Republican Party, told The Daily Signal that thousands have signed it.\n\n\u201cA 30-day residency requirement to vote in New Hampshire is appropriate, and polls show overwhelming support for this approach,\u201d said Horn. \u201cInstead of supporting this reasonable legislation, Gov. Maggie Hassan and her allies are more concerned with peddling divisive rhetoric and pushing policies that undermine confidence in our electoral process.\u201d\n\nOpponents of the bill argue that a 30-day residency requirement restricts voting rights.\n\n\u201cOnce again, when New Hampshire Republicans can\u2019t win on the issues, they seek to disenfranchise voters,\u201d Ray Buckley, the chairman of the New Hampshire Democratic Party, told the Union Leader. \u201cGranite Staters will not stand for these blatantly partisan attempts to make it harder for New Hampshire citizens to cast a ballot.\u201d\n\nAccording to the National Conference of State Legislatures, few states allow same-day voter registration, and most require that voters register by a deadline preceding an election, \u201cwith most falling between eight and 30 days before the election.\u201d\n\nHans von Spakovsky, a senior legal fellow at The Heritage Foundation, praised the legislation.\n\n\u201cThis is a good move by New Hampshire to restore integrity to its election process,\u201d said von Spakovsky.\n\n\u201cOnly about a dozen states allow same-day registration, a process that makes it impossible for election officials to verify the accuracy of registration information,\u201d he continued. \u201cThis allows individuals who are not really residents of the state to engage in drive-by-voting. All other states have some type of waiting period, ranging from 10 days up to a 30 days maximum.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis will not prevent any legitimate voters from voting,\u201d he added.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Could this reduce voter fraud?", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Could this reduce voter fraud?", "title": "N.H.
