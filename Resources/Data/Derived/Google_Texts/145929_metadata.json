While displaying almost no redeeming qualities \u2014 outside of those piercing baby blues \u2014 Cooper\u2019s Adam Jones manipulates Miller\u2019s character (whose character may as well be named \u201cGirl Chef\u201d) into working with him and then repeatedly bribes her not to quit because of his abusive behavior; in one scene, he violently grabs her by the shirt for daring to question his authority. Jones forces the Elmer Fudd-ish ma\u00eetre d\u2019 to give him the head chef job at his dying father\u2019s restaurant \u2014 because Jones knows Fuddy is in love with him (hey, who isn\u2019t?). And in a telling moment, he facetiously suggests that a shy cook should work for him for free \u2014 all to prove a point: You have to be a jerk to get what you want.\n\nIt might seem like \u201cBurnt\u201d is \u201cWall Street\u201d with a frying pan, but the film\u2019s \u201cnarcissism is good\u201d ethos is less a philosophy than a love letter to insufferable white golden boys and the people who find them dangerously irresistible. \u201cBurnt\u201d validates and redeems Jones\u2019 numerous misdeeds not by having him ever apologize for his behavior or make amends but by repeatedly reminding us a) that he\u2019s so brilliant b) that he\u2019s so damaged (bad childhood: check!) and c) that he\u2019s not overtly horrible to children. In Adam\u2019s redemptive \u201che\u2019s not so bad after all!\u201c scene, he deigns to bake Girl Chef\u2019s daughter a cake \u2014 and even eats it with her. This is, of course, after he wouldn\u2019t let Girl Chef have the actual day off to throw her daughter a party.\n\nIf little separates Adam Jones from Patrick Bateman aside from a knife and an adult poncho, Adam Jones actually exemplifies a time-honored type in American cinema: In real life, you would file a restraining order against him, but unfortunately, he\u2019s attractive, Caucasian and the protagonist of the film. The Hot White Douche is as old as the history of the cinema itself: In the film \u201cHis Girl Friday,\u201d you\u2019d throw a pie in Cary Grant\u2019s face if he weren\u2019t, well, Cary Grant. In a memorable scene from \u201cThe Philadelphia Story,\u201d Grant actually facepalms Katherine Hepburn, pushing her to the ground \u2014 and then they end up together. And James Bond has made a 50-year career off being a debonair dickbag; a recent review of \u201cSpectre\u201d called 007 a \u201cviolent misogynist,\u201d and even Daniel Craig agreed. Sexism just looks better in Tom Ford.\n\nThe current cinema has given us famous examples of the Hot White Douche like Edward Cullen and Christian Grey, both of whom teach horny teenage Mormons and middle-aged hausfraus that there\u2019s nothing sexier than abusive relationships. But even less controversial characters have distinct HWD tendencies: In \u201cReality Bites,\u201d Winona Ryder ends up with Ethan Hawke \u2014 a pretentious, greasy-haired jerk who spends the whole movie being mean to her \u2014 for no other reason than the script says so (they \u201cbelong together\u201d or something). \u201cBridget Jones\u2019 Diary\u201d and \u201cThe Ugly Truth\u201d respectively give us Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant) and Mike (Gerard Butler), whose workplace behavior should be used as a cautionary tale at sexual harassment seminars.\n\nThe problem with a movie like \u201cThe Ugly Truth\u201d isn\u2019t just that the screenplay (which was somehow written by three women) lets the misogynist get the girl but that it, like \u201cBurnt,\u201d proves his worldview correct. \u201cThe Ugly Truth\u201d offers a Cyrano de Bergerac scenario in which Mike helps Abby (Katherine Heigl) get laid by teaching her what men like \u2014 which is Cool Girls who wear tight dresses and find all their jokes hilarious. Of course, Abby finds that his methods work \u2014 until she and Mike inevitably fall in love. \u201cJurassic World\u201d offers the same thesis: For women, there\u2019s nothing sexier than a scruffy asshole (this time Chris Pratt) with a six-pack ordering you around.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Movie after movie reinforces the odious belief that exceptional white jerks deserve the privilege to be bad", "title": "In \u201cBurnt,\u201d the brilliant white douche wins again: We love to excuse bad behavior from successful creeps \u2014 how else do you explain Donald Trump?", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Movie after movie reinforces the odious belief that exceptional white jerks deserve the privilege to be bad", "title": "In \u201cBurnt,\u201d the brilliant white douche wins again: We love to excuse bad behavior from successful creeps \u2014 how else do you explain Donald Trump?", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/11/01/in_burnt_the_brilliant_white_douche_wins_again_we_love_to_excuse_bad_behavior_from_successful_creeps_how_else_do_you_explain_donald_trump/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/10/burnt_trump.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Movie after movie reinforces the odious belief that exceptional white jerks deserve the privilege to be bad", "title": "In \u201cBurnt,\u201d the brilliant white douche wins again: We love to excuse bad behavior from successful creeps \u2014 how else do you explain Donald Trump?", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/10/burnt_trump.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Nico Lang", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Bradley Cooper, Burnt, Donald Trump, Editor's Picks, Movies", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "This is, of course, after he wouldn\u2019t let Girl Chef have the actual day off to throw her daughter a party.\n\u201cBridget Jones\u2019 Diary\u201d and \u201cThe Ugly Truth\u201d respectively give us Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant) and Mike (Gerard Butler), whose workplace behavior should be used as a cautionary tale at sexual harassment seminars.\n\u201cThe Ugly Truth\u201d offers a Cyrano de Bergerac scenario in which Mike helps Abby (Katherine Heigl) get laid by teaching her what men like \u2014 which is Cool Girls who wear tight dresses and find all their jokes hilarious.\nOf course, Abby finds that his methods work \u2014 until she and Mike inevitably fall in love.\nIn Adam\u2019s redemptive \u201che\u2019s not so bad after all!\u201c scene, he deigns to bake Girl Chef\u2019s daughter a cake \u2014 and even eats it with her."}
