It's pretty clear that they've never had a conversation with the women in their lives about how stuff like getting birth control works. Because they literally think that it's more of a burden for some HR person to write a note to their insurance company than it is for a woman to have to find a second policy on her own and find a doctor that takes that insurance.\n\n\u201cWhat type a burden does that impose? Is it because these exchanges are so unworkable, even with the help of a navigator, that a woman who wants to get free contraceptive coverage simply has to sign up for that on one of the exchanges?\u201d Justice Samuel Alito asked, snarkily, about the Obamacare health insurance exchanges used by those without employer-based health care plans.\n\n[Solicitor General Donald Verrilli, who was defending the accommodation] pointed out that those sort of contraceptive-only policies don\u2019t even exist on the exchanges, and in a hypothetical world where they did, that extra effort undercuts the reason Congress passed a mandate for preventive care in the first place.\n\n\u201cHer regular doctor has to say to her, 'Sorry, I can't help you.' It's not just that you don't get the prescription paid for. It's not just that he can't write the prescription, he can't counsel or educate the patient,\u201d Verrilli said.\n\nAlito didn\u2019t believe that is what would happen, arguing that her regular doctor would just be paid for by whatever second plan the woman purchased. Verrilli countered it wouldn\u2019t all happen so seamlessly.\n\n\u201cShe'd have to go out and buy the separate plan, find a doctor who is willing to take the separate plan,\u201d Verrilli said, but Alito's disbelief continued: Why can't Congress could simply subsidize second plans for affected female employees to purchase?", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Daily Kos", "description": "The old white men on the Supreme Court clearly have never been responsible for getting their own insurance ever in their lives.
