Grassley, who arguably holds the fate of criminal justice legislation in his hands. Obama did reach out to Grassley a week later to personally invite him to the White House. But Grassley\u2019s initial absence underscores his complicated and unpredictable role in this year\u2019s criminal justice debate.\n\nGrassley has made no bones about his passionate opposition to reducing mandatory minimum prison sentences, as proposed by Republican Sen. Mike Lee of Utah and Senate Minority Whip Richard J. Durbin of Illinois in the so-called Smarter Sentencing Act (S 1410).\n\nOn the floor, Grassley has called rolling back such fixed sentences \u201cdangerous,\u201d \u201cill-conceived\u201d and \u201cindefensible.\u201d Last year, he tried to gut a version of the bipartisan bill, which the Obama administration backs, with an amendment in committee.\n\nEven so, Grassley told CQ Roll Call that he\u2019s ready to start looking for common ground with the bill\u2019s supporters. What\u2019s been missing, he adds, is an invitation \u2014 from Obama, from the senators sponsoring the bill, from their staffs \u2014 from anyone willing to start a conversation.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, nobody\u2019s asked me even though for three months, including my speech last week, I said I would be glad to meet people about what we could possibly do because I\u2019m open to some reform,\u201d Grassley says.\n\nJuvenile justice is among his top legislative priorities, and he has said he plans to co-sponsor a bill with Rhode Island Democrat Sheldon Whitehouse to reauthorize the 1974 Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act. That law has not been reauthorized since 2002.\n\nGrassley says he thinks there could be some reductions in mandatory minimums, but at the same time he wants to see increases in minimum sentences in other areas, such as child pornography and white-collar crime. He has also cited the need to prevent abuses in the forfeiture of civil assets, and to ensure that offenders receive fair representation.\n\n\u201cIt may just be time\u201d to start criminal justice talks, Grassley says. He notes that he \u201cdid have the president\u201d on the phone, adding: \u201cI don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s because he realized he made a mistake by not inviting me to the White House when the other people met. The president called me on another issue and at the end of that conversation, he asked me if would I would be willing to come down to the White House.\u201d\n\nGrassley will be \u201ca key partner in this effort,\u201d Anthony Romero, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union, said at a February event to launch the Coalition for Public Safety, which backs criminal law changes. Romero added: \u201cIt\u2019s also true that we will have to be opportunistic.\u201d He said it makes sense to focus first on small changes such as civil asset forfeiture protections.\n\nBackers of the Smarter Sentencing Act aren\u2019t holding out much hope for winning over Grassley.\n\n\u201cThe arguments for the Smarter Sentencing Act are merely a weak attempt to defend the indefensible,\u201d Grassley said in a blistering March 10 floor speech. \u201cWhat I have called the leniency industrial complex refers then to the people who are sentenced to drug mandatory minimum sentences as \u2018nonviolent.\u2019 They use that term even though any truly nonviolent offenders would qualify for the safety valve.\u201d\n\nTo John Malcolm, a senior legal fellow at the Heritage Foundation, which backs sentencing and other criminal justice revisions, such statements are unequivocal.\n\n\u201cI have serious doubts that someone who refers to any argument in favor of mandatory minimum reform as \u2018indefensible\u2019 and anyone who supports such reforms (which would include me) as a member of the \u2018leniency industrial complex\u2019 is moveable on this issue,\u201d Malcolm wrote in an email.\n\nStill, advocates of sentencing changes aren\u2019t giving up.\n\n\u201cThe chair of the committee taking a position against the bill is unhelpful,\u201d acknowledges Rep. Robert C. Scott, a Virginia Democrat who wrote the House version of the Smarter Sentencing Act with Idaho Republican Ra\u00fal R. Labrador. \u201cBut he only has one vote. If something gets to the floor and you start having floor votes, he\u2019s back to one.\u201d\n\nThis piece originally appeared as the cover story in the April 13 CQ Weekly.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sixteen senators and representatives accepted an invitation to the White House from President Barack Obama on Feb. 24 to discuss ways the administration and Congress could work together to pass a meaningful criminal justice overhaul.", "og": {"site_name": "Roll Call", "description": "Sixteen senators and representatives accepted an invitation to the White House from President Barack Obama on Feb. 24 to discuss ways the administration and Congress could work together to pass a meaningful criminal justice overhaul.", "title": "Grassley Resistant to Criminal Justice Overhaul, but Says He\u2019s Willing to Talk", "url": "http://www.rollcall.com/news/Chairman-Resistant-but-Says-Hes-Willing-to-Talk-241167-1.html", "image": {"type": "image/png"}, "updated_time": "2015-04-13T10:57:39Z", "type": "website"}, "abstract": "Sixteen senators and representatives accepted an invitation to the White House from President Barack Obama on Feb. 24 to discuss ways the administration and Congress could work together to pass a meaningful criminal justice overhaul.", "fb": {"app_id": 1383531991672364}, "keywords": "iProCategory,iProStoryType,iProProductCategory,iProSpecialCategory,iProSpecialCategory,iProSpecialCategory,iProSDMID", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-13T10:57:39Z", "modified_time": "2015-04-13T10:57:39Z"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.rollcall.com/news/Chairman-Resistant-but-Says-Hes-Willing-to-Talk-241167-1.html", "title": "Grassley Resistant to Criminal Justice Overhaul, but Says He\u2019s Willing to Talk", "description": "Sixteen senators and representatives accepted an invitation to the White House from President Barack Obama on Feb. 24 to discuss ways the administration and Congress could work together to pass a mea", "card": "summary |player (See: https://dev.twitter.com/cards/types/player We will have to submit a test and get approval before using this type)", "site": "@rollcall"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe054f\"", "article_summary": "But Grassley\u2019s initial absence underscores his complicated and unpredictable role in this year\u2019s criminal justice debate.\n\u201cIt may just be time\u201d to start criminal justice talks, Grassley says.\nConspicuously absent was the Senate Judiciary Committee chairman, Iowa Republican Charles E.
