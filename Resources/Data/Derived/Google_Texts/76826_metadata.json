All that\u2019s needed is for the cities to make like Kolkata and stop trying to make Uber play by the same rules as taxi firms. On Friday a suburb of the Indian city (not the whole of Kolkata, despite what Uber says) decided Uber was an IT firm rather than a cab service \u2013 a decision at odds with that made in other cities such as New Delhi.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKalanick and his firm also claimed that E.U. taxis frequently operate \u201coff-grid\u201d (which may come as news to his more tightly-regulated rivals) and said the introduction of Uber would \u201cincrease transportation providers\u2019 compliance and overall tax revenue for cities and countries across Europe.\u201d Uber also pointed to its recent launch of city data-sharing programs, saying it could help manage growth, reduce congestion and so on.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat\u2019s a job?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor a start, I personally find Uber\u2019s definition of a \u201cjob\u201d to be a bit confusing. One slide in Kalanick\u2019s DLD presentation talked about the jobs that have been created in various cities through Uber\u2019s presence: 7,500 in San Francisco, 13,750 in New York, 7,800 in London (according to Kalanick himself; the slide said 10,000). However, Kalanick started off this part of the talk by carefully referring to \u201cequivalent full-time jobs\u201d \u2013 \u201cRemember, we have people driving on the Uber platform full-time, and people driving 5-10 hours a week\u201d \u2014 then slipped into plain old \u201cjobs\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, is this 50,000 actual full-time jobs or a combination of full-time jobs and many part-time jobs that all add up to the equivalent of 50,000 full-time jobs? If tax is the public authorities\u2019 concern, then this distinction makes a significant difference. Someone who\u2019s making a small amount of money on Uber may not, if that\u2019s their only income, be liable for any income tax at all due to minimum thresholds. Of course, this will only account for a certain proportion of the people we\u2019re talking about, but a breakdown is necessary if cities are to look beyond the attraction of the headline figures.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m assuming that Uber\u2019s enthusiasm for greater tax revenues is limited to income and sales tax \u2013 the company has established a complex network of subsidiaries to ensure that it itself pays very little corporation tax.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMost seriously, we must also remember that these jobs, whatever the numbers, are positions of self-employment that don\u2019t come with any job security or social benefits. This status also creates issues around liability \u2013 an implication of the Bidhannagar/Kolkata decision that has been keenly debated.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn a side note, I was also struck by Kalanick\u2019s claim that Uber could give cities \u201cmore efficiency on your existing mass transit options\u201d. Yes, tempting people off mass transit and into Uber cars (or, better from an environmental perspective, UberPool cars) would ease the burden on said mass transit, but it would also reduce revenues, meaning that the public option may need to become more expensive or less well-maintained \u2013 both good outcomes for the private alternatives.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPolitical impact\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI do agree with Kalanick about protectionism, to an extent at least. The taxi firms that have been giving Uber a hard time and bending local politicians\u2019 ears obviously don\u2019t want price-cutting competition, and rules that limit the numbers of transportation providers in a given city should be up for debate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat said, I still firmly believe that the traditional cabbies are right to complain about competition that is allowed to operate according to different rules, putting them in a disadvantageous position. City officials do need to formulate new rules, but they need to be very cautiously calibrated to ensure safety and accountability.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat\u2019s more, those officials have to recognise that the kind of employment Uber is pitching marks a big socio-political change, particularly in broadly social-democratic Europe. Kalanick may be in favor of European-style (debatable, I know) social insurance programs such as Obamacare because they \u201callow people to have more flexible ways to make a living\u201d, but the model he\u2019s pushing would deny such programs any employer contributions. Depending on the country, this would put more of the social insurance burden on the state and/or the self-employed driver.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s great for aggregators such as Uber, which are absolved of any responsibility for their not-employees\u2019 healthcare, pension and general social wellbeing, but not so great for the public authorities running such schemes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPerhaps services such as Uber do represent the future of urban transportation \u2014 there is a genuine case to be made for the impact on emissions and efficiency, particularly when it comes to carpooling. But, as they manage the transition into the future, city and national officials had better take the more seductive claims about revenue with a scoop of salt, and think very carefully about the implications.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iayagHygV0Q&w=560&h=315]\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis article was updated on January 20th to note that it was only a suburb of Kolkata, not the whole city, that recognized Uber as an IT company.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.title": "The problem with Uber\u2019s European job promises", "application-name": "Gigaom", "dcterms.modified": "2015-01-20", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "dcterms.creator": "David Meyer", "dcterms.date": "2015-01-19", "keywords": "eu, europe, india, kolkata, mass transit, platforms, uber, uberpool", "news_keywords": "eu, europe, india, kolkata, mass transit, platforms, uber, uberpool", "author": "David Meyer", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "theme-color": "#ecebe6", "dcterms.publisher": "Gigaom", "description": "The newly humble Uber has made its pitch to city officials around Europe by promising the creation of \u201c50,000 jobs\u201d during 2015\u2026", "robots": "NOODP", "MobileOptimized": 320, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://gigaom.com/wp-content/themes/go-ossein/library/images/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "msvalidate.01": "6AFF4FA8C591A576B80A612AF591A343", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "dcterms.created": "2015-01-19", "og": {"image": "https://gigaom.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/1/2014/09/454509954-804x536.jpg"}, "dcterms.subject": "eu; europe; india; kolkata; mass transit; platforms; uber; uberpool", "google-site-verification": "qCPIC6UK_23CR6SxLn2bCjE-Ow0OSYoDExoi699IE98", "y_key": "a09dd3172406080e"}, "article_summary": "AdvertisementSo, is this 50,000 actual full-time jobs or a combination of full-time jobs and many part-time jobs that all add up to the equivalent of 50,000 full-time jobs?\nCity officials do need to formulate new rules, but they need to be very cautiously calibrated to ensure safety and accountability.\nAdvertisementFor a start, I personally find Uber\u2019s definition of a \u201cjob\u201d to be a bit confusing.\nAdvertisementMost seriously, we must also remember that these jobs, whatever the numbers, are positions of self-employment that don\u2019t come with any job security or social benefits.\nDepending on the country, this would put more of the social insurance burden on the state and/or the self-employed driver."}
