Thanks to the efforts of interns from the Bartle Bogle Hegarty advertising agency, dogs are out seeking puppy love too.\n\nThe interns recently partnered with Social Tees Animal Rescue, a Manhattan-based nonprofit, to create Tinder profiles for dogs needing homes.\n\nThe project gives a new twist to the Tinder system of swiping right to like and left to dislike.\n\nIt all starts with a right swipe on a dog\u2019s picture. The doggy dating service starts by giving users something casual, like setting up a brief walk date with the dog of their choice. At the same time, it provides information on adoption and volunteering opportunities at the organization housing that particular pet.\n\nIf you just want to keep things casual or aren\u2019t ready for the adoption level of commitment, the service also allows users to schedule sessions of dog-walking or to serve as foster homes, which host dogs for a few weeks.\n\nAre Tinder and puppy love a match made in heaven? It\u2019s a little soon to say.\n\nSamantha Brody, the development manager for the project, told NBC News in an email that there were no plans to expand the program outside of New York City. When asked what Tinder thought of this creative use of their service, Brody confessed that the company was still in the dark.\n\n\u201cI have no idea how Tinder would react but I would hope they would appreciate the creativity attempt to draw more attention to animal rescue, which saves more lives,\u201d she said.\n\nWatch the ad for the doggy dating service below:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Via screengrab People aren\u2019t the only ones looking for love or a hook-up on Tinder.
