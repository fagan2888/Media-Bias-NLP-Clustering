Police in Fort Collins said Saturday they arrested a man accused of firing a shot at detectives attempting to arrest him on Friday night.

Jose Ornelas-Licano, 40, allegedly fired one shot at detectives who arrived at a residence to arrest him on suspicion of fraud and drug charges. Police say Ornelas-Licano then tried to flee the scene in a Ford F-250 truck before wrecking the vehicle and taking off on foot.

No one was hit by the shot.

Police say Ornelas-Licano, who was taken into custody without incident on Saturday afternoon, was arrested “because of an observant citizen.”

Ornelas-Licano was arrested sitting on a bench outside of a Family Dollar Store. Police say he did not have a gun with him at the time of his arrest.

Police say additional charges against Ornelas-Licano are pending.
