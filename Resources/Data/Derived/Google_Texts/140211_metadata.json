The Wisconsin Republican proposed separating insurance for people with preexisting conditions to keep the cost of covering sick people from significantly increasing the cost of insurance for the healthy. Rep. Vern Buchanan became the first House Republican to back the Obama administration\u2019s request for $1.9 billion to fight the spread of the Zika virus. Buchanan is the second Florida Republican, after Sen. Marco Rubio, to support the request for emergency funding. House Democrats on the Natural Resources Committee released a report saying austerity cuts in Puerto Rico have made the island more susceptible to the Zika virus. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) and House Armed Services Committee Chairman Mac Thornberry (R-Texas) requested an investigation into a planned intelligence center for the Pentagon in the United Kingdom. The lawmakers say the facility could cost much more to build in the U.K. than in other locations. Some Senate Republicans and Democrats from coastal states are pushing for legislation that would make it easier for temporary foreign workers to enter the country, a move that would boost the seasonal workforce during crabbing season in states like Maryland and North Carolina. Senate Republican leaders frequently say the chamber is \u201cback to work\u201d under their leadership, but this election year the Senate is scheduled to work the fewest days in 60 years. Since Republicans took control of the Senate in January 2015, the chamber has confirmed the fewest civilian presidential nominees of any Congress in the past 30 years. Executive action President Obama commuted the sentences of 58 nonviolent prisoners. Obama has now granted clemency to 306 inmates. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew wrote to Speaker Ryan, urging him to work quickly to resolve \u201cthe few outstanding issues\u201d on legislation that would help Puerto Rico manage its $70 billion in debt. The commonwealth missed almost $370 million on a bond payment at the beginning of the month. Gov. Alejandro Garcia Padilla warned Congress that the commonwealth will likely not be able to pay a $2 billion debt that\u2019s due on July 1. Supreme Court fight Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) will not allow the chamber to consider Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland, despite calls from some conservatives to confirm him now that Donald Trump is the party\u2019s presumptive nominee. Groups backing Garland\u2019s nomination spent about $1.6 million on television ads through April 14th, but since then the only ad buy came from Planned Parenthood, at $137,000. Meanwhile, the Judicial Crisis Network, which opposes Garland\u2019s nomination, made a $500,000 ad buy in battleground states bashing Garland\u2019s \u201cliberal record.\u201d A majority of Iowa voters disagree with Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley\u2019s (R-Iowa) vow not to consider Garland. Fifty-seven percent of Iowans surveyed prefer that the Senate hold hearings and a confirmation vote on Garland\u2019s nomination, while 35 percent said the chamber should wait until the next president takes office. Obama gave interviews to television stations in the home states of seven Senate Republican incumbents. He made his case for the Senate to hold hearings and a vote on Garland. Fifty-one percent of Democratic voters say former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton should nominate Garland to the Supreme Court if Clinton is elected president in November. Congressional campaigns Indiana Rep. Todd Young bested Rep. Marlin Stutzman to win Indiana\u2019s Senate Republican primary. Young will face former Rep. Baron Hill (D-Ind.) in November to replace retiring Sen. Dan Coats (R). The DCCC, the campaign arm for House Democrats, reserved almost $32 million in television ads across 14 congressional districts. The group is targeting nine Republican incumbents, defending two Democrats and trying to win three open seats. New or strengthened voter identification laws will be in place in 15 states for the first time in a presidential election. The laws are changing how campaigns are run, with candidates such as former Rep. Pete Gallego (D-Texas) spending time to ensure his supporters can cast their votes in a rematch against freshman Republican Rep. Will Hurd. Presidential campaign Trump became the presumptive Republican nominee after rival Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) suspended his campaign after the polls closed Tuesday in Indiana. Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R) suspended his campaign a day after Cruz. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) beat Clinton in Indiana\u2019s Democratic primary, though Clinton is still expected to win the Democratic nomination. Speaker Ryan, who is also chair of the Republican National Convention, said he cannot support Trump at this point. Ryan\u2019s hesitancy to back Trump illustrates how Republicans fear Trump could damage their congressional majorities. Other Republican lawmakers are grappling over whether to back Trump. McConnell gave him a lukewarm endorsement, and some vulnerable GOP incumbents said they would support him, even as they criticized Trump. Sanders\u2019 fundraising declined sharply in April. His campaign raised $25.8 million, compared with $46 million in March. The excitement and interest surrounding this year\u2019s presidential campaign has helped expose a weak, inefficient and arcane regime of election rules and laws around the nation. Democratic primary voters are moving further left. The number of voters who call themselves liberal has grown since 2008 across every state where exit pollsters have surveyed voters this year.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/icons/browserconfig.xml", "og": {"site_name": "Morning Consult", "description": "Week in Review Legislative action Speaker Paul Ryan offered a glimpse into one way Republicans could repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act under a Republican administration.
