Shelby\u2019s decision came three days after he overturned the state\u2019s ban on same-sex marriage, ruling it is unconstitutional. Utah lawyers are expected to ask a higher court to put the process on hold.\n\nThe county clerk in Salt Lake City immediately began issuing licenses after Shelby\u2019s ruling Friday, and hundreds more gay couples were lined up Monday to get married.\n\nThe ruling has drawn attention given Utah\u2019s long-standing opposition to gay marriage and its position as headquarters for the Mormon church.\n\nLawyers for the state waged a legal battle on several fronts as they sought to stop the same-sex weddings.\n\nOn Sunday, a federal appeals court rejected the state\u2019s emergency request to stay the ruling, saying it couldn\u2019t rule on a stay since Shelby had not yet acted on the motion before him. The court quickly rejected a second request from Utah on Monday.\n\nFollowing Shelby\u2019s surprising ruling Friday afternoon, gay and lesbian couples rushed to a county clerk\u2019s office in Salt Lake City to get marriage licenses. More than 100 couples wed as others cheered them on in what became an impromptu celebration at an office building about 3 miles from the headquarters of the Mormon church.\n\nAbout 25 couples lined up outside the clerk\u2019s office in Davis County on Monday morning. The first couple showed up around 6 a.m. and married immediately after receiving their license.\n\nFor now, a state considered one of the most conservative in the nation has joined the likes of California and New York to become the 18th state where same-sex couples can legally wed. Legal experts have said that even if a judge put a halt to the weddings, the licenses that already have been issued likely will still be valid.\n\nMany Utah residents belong to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and Mormons dominate the state\u2019s legal and political circles.\n\nThe Mormon church was one of the leading forces behind California\u2019s short-lived ban on same-sex marriage, Proposition 8, which voters approved in 2008. The church said Friday it stands by its support for \u201ctraditional marriage,\u201d and it hopes a higher court validates its belief that marriage is between a man and woman.\n\nIn Shelby\u2019s 53-page ruling, he said the constitutional amendment that Utah voters approved in 2004 violates gay and lesbian couples\u2019 rights to due process and equal protection under the 14th Amendment. Shelby said the state failed to show that allowing same-sex marriages would affect opposite-sex marriages in any way.\n\nThe decision drew a swift and angry reaction from Republican Gov. Gary Herbert, who said he was disappointed in an \u201cactivist federal judge attempting to override the will of the people of Utah.\u201d The state quickly took steps to appeal the ruling and halt the process, setting up Monday\u2019s hearing before Shelby.\n\nThe ruling has thrust Shelby into the national spotlight. He has been on the bench for less than two years, appointed by President Barack Obama after GOP Sen. Orrin Hatch recommended him in November 2011.\n\nShelby served in the Utah Army National Guard from 1988 to 1996 and was a combat engineer in Operation Desert Storm. He graduated from the University of Virginia law school in 1998 and clerked for the U.S. District Judge J. Thomas Greene in Utah, then spent about 12 years in private practice before he became a judge.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A federal judge said Monday he will allow gay marriage in Utah to continue, denying a request from the state to halt same-sex weddings until the appeals process plays out.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A federal judge said Monday he will allow gay marriage in Utah to continue, denying a request from the state to halt same-sex weddings until the appeals process plays out.", "title": "Judge allows gay marriage in Utah to continue", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/dec/23/utahs-same-sex-marriage-ban-back-court/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/12/23/gay-marriage-utahjpeg-0480b.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/12/23/gay-marriage-utahjpeg-0480b.jpg", "description": "A federal judge said Monday he will allow gay marriage in Utah to continue, denying a request from the state to halt same-sex weddings until the appeals process plays out.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Judge allows gay marriage in Utah to continue"}, "Author": "Brady McCombs, Paul Foy", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Social Issues, Law Crime, Robert J Shelby,  Unknown"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7d85\"", "article_summary": "U.S. District Judge Robert J.
