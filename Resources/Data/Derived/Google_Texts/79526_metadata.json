However, the rapidly evolving H3N2 strain mutated and wasn\u2019t detected until March, too late to include in the season's vaccinations.\n\nAs a result of the flu strain\u2019s mutation, this year's vaccines were only 33 percent effective, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told ABC News.\n\n\"The influenza vaccine that was prepared for this year\u2019s flu season is poorly matched to half of H3N2 viruses circulating,\" the Ohio Department of Health recently reported.\n\nThe mutated H3N2 influenza strain is making 95 percent of those with the flu this season sick, said Dr. Madhuri Sopirala, medical director of infection control at UC Medical Center. She is seeing a 40-percent increase in flu among her patients.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re having a severe flu season this year,\u201d Sopirala said.\n\nThe Tri-State is among 29 states experiencing high levels of influenza-like illnesses, according to the Centers for Disease Control. In Ohio, 1,919 flu cases have been reported so far. In Northern Kentucky, 1,341 cases have been reported, including five deaths.\n\nTwo infants have died in Ohio so far this flu season.\n\nREAD MORE: Flu epidemic keeps docs, parents on their feet\n\nThe uptick in cases is due to the unpredictability of flu strains.\n\nThe World Health Organization\u2019s committee of experts chooses which viruses to include in the upcoming season\u2019s vaccine.\n\n\u201cThey predict what will happen next year based on the strains that we had this year,\u201d Sopirala said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to predict. You have a new strain now that the vaccine does not include,\u201d Sopirala explained. The vaccine must be created early enough in the year so it can be manufactured and distributed to be ready for shots before flu season hits.\n\nDespite the ineffectiveness of this year's vaccine, Sopirala and others are still recommending flu shots to protect against other strains of the virus.\n\n\u201cIt still offers protection, so I\u2019d definitely get the vaccine,\u201d she advised.\n\nThe CDC is also recommending that doctors prescribe an antiviral drug, such as Tamiflu, as a second line of defense as soon as possible to patients with confirmed or suspected influenza who are hospitalized, or may be at higher risk for complications.", "article_metadata": {"isPremium": "true", "description": "If you think you\u2019ve experienced more fevers, aches and nausea, you\u2019re right.
