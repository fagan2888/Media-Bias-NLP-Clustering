And though Indiana's late primary is often seen as just a formality (because the races are all but decided by the time May rolls around), things are a bit different this year.\n\nIndiana has been called a \"must-win\" state for GOP candidate Donald Trump, and his opponents Ted Cruz and John Kasich have responded by collaborating on a strategy for the state \u2014 Kasich's campaign agreed to pull resources from Indiana and focus on other races, letting Cruz take on Trump in Indiana.\n\nOn the Democrat side, many are calling the race in Hillary Clinton's favor, and her campaign tone has switched in recent weeks to a greater focus on the general election. But Bernie Sanders continues to push, and his enthusiastic grassroots support hasn't waned.\n\nAs the battle descends on the state and Hoosiers prepare to visit the polls, here's some information about the candidates\n\nand some of the issues they've chosen to highlight during their campaigns:\n\nCLINTON ON CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM:\n\n\u2014 Work to strengthen trust between communities and police by investing in law enforcement training programs, supporting legislation to end racial profiling, providing federal funds for police body cameras and creating national guidelines on use of force\n\n\u2014 Take action on mandatory minimum sentences by cutting in half the current minimums for nonviolent drug offenses, applying the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 retroactively, eliminating the sentencing disparity for crack and powder cocaine, re-evaluating policies on prior offenses\n\n\u2014 Promote successful re-entry by supporting the \"ban the box\" initiative and restoring voting rights to offenders who have served their sentences\n\nON HEALTH CARE:\n\n\u2014 Build on the Affordable Care Act by making premiums more affordable and lessening out-of-pocket consumer expenses, supporting incentives for state Medicaid expansion, expanding access regardless of immigration status\n\n\u2014 Expand health care access to rural Americans\n\n\u2014 Ensure women have access to reproductive health care, including safe and legal abortions\n\nON RACIAL JUSTICE:\n\n\u2014 Dismantle the school-to-prison pipeline by providing funds to support schools in reforming disciplinary policies\n\n\u2014 End the era of mass incarceration\n\n\u2014 Protect the right to vote by fighting to repair the Voting Rights Act and implementing automatic voter registration\n\nFor more on Clinton's platform, visit hillaryclinton.com/issues.\n\nCRUZ ON THE U.S. CONSTITUTION:\n\n\"We need to restore the Constitution as our standard.
