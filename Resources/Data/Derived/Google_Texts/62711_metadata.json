Soon you will get to know the bad half,\u201d read a sign carried by a marcher. Not only was it clever, but it also rang true. In a recent editorial, Gazeta.ru wrote that \u201cfor the first time, nationalist marches are taking on an oppositionist character.\u201d After years of successfully manipulating nationalists for their own purposes and cultivating xenophobia among the population, the Kremlin is now standing face-to-face with the monster it helped create. \u201cThose nationalists who did not join up with the authorities in time attached themselves to the protest movement\u2014you have to avoid your own marginalization somehow,\u201d political analyst Andrei Kolesnikov wrote in a \u200brecent commentary.\n\nIn addition to the predictable chants of \u201cRussia for Russians,\u201d \u201cStop Feeding the Caucasus,\u201d and various anti-migrant diatribes at this year's Russian March, there were plenty of calls for the end of Vladimir Putin's \u201cChekist regime.\u201d But to get a grip on what is really happening in Russia now, we need to look beyond the dramatic and violent manifestations of nationalism\u2014the race riots in Moscow's Biryulevo district, the attack on a Moscow-Dushanbe train, or marchers calling for \u201cdeath to Caucasians\u201d\u2014and look at the more latent, and widespread, variant. And widespread it is according to a recent poll by the independent Levada Center. According to the poll, nearly 73 percent of Russians\u2014and more than 80 percent of Muscovites\u2014favor the deportation of migrant workers. Some 66 percent of Russians agreed to some degree with the idea that \u201cRussia is for Russians,\u201d while only 19 percent said such a sentiment was \u201cfascist.\u201d Levada Center director Lev Gudkov said it showed that \u201cbetween 70 and 80 percent\u201d of Russians harbor xenophobic sentiments. Most of these people will never attend the Russian March. They won't ransack a vegetable warehouse searching for migrants. And they are unlikely to attack a train from Tajikistan. But they are deeply disturbed by what they perceive as an influx of migrants and with the criminality they associate with it. Many believe\u2014despite evidence to the contrary\u2014that non-Russian citizens of the Russian Federation are privileged and ethnic Russians are discriminated against. \u201cTo understand Russian nationalism, even racism, you need to realize that despite their political, cultural, and numerical dominance, many Russians see themselves a nation without a state,\u201d Sean Guillory of the University of Pittsburgh's Center for Russian and Eastern European Studies wrote in The Nation. It is this latent nationalism of the silent majority that is driving much of the political dynamic right now. These aren't black-clad skinheads. Many are respectable urban professionals, students, and entrepreneurs. In a 2012 report, the Public Chamber warned of a \u201csharp rise\u201d in xenophobia among city dwellers and the highly educated.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Russian nationalism, with its dangerous xenophobic overtones, is now spreading to the country&#39;s &#39;silent majority.&#39;", "author": "Brian Whitmore", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "Russian nationalism, with its dangerous xenophobic overtones, is now spreading to the country&#39;s &#39;silent majority.&#39;", "title": "The Kremlin Is Losing Control of the Nationalist Movement It Helped Create", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2013/11/RTX14ZKZ/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/11/the-kremlin-is-losing-control-of-the-nationalist-movement-it-helped-create/281291/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce811\"", "article_summary": "For all the crude xenophobic placards and slogans at this week's Russian March, one stood out for its\u2014dare I say\u2014cleverness.\nMany believe\u2014despite evidence to the contrary\u2014that non-Russian citizens of the Russian Federation are privileged and ethnic Russians are discriminated against.\nIn a 2012 report, the Public Chamber warned of a \u201csharp rise\u201d in xenophobia among city dwellers and the highly educated.\nIt is this latent nationalism of the silent majority that is driving much of the political dynamic right now.\nAccording to the poll, nearly 73 percent of Russians\u2014and more than 80 percent of Muscovites\u2014favor the deportation of migrant workers."}
