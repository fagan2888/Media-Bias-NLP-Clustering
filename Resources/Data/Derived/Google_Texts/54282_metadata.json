Amazingly, he didn\u2019t break character once, stopping to talk and joke with each child individually.\n\n\u201cHe was taking his time to make sure he spoke to each and every one of them,\u201d Rachel Bennett, the mother of a 7-year-old boy with transverse myelitis, told Australia\u2019s ABC News. \u201cIt was really beautiful. Everyone kept on trying to move him on, but he kept on coming back.\u201d\n\nJohnny Depp brought Captain Jack to shore for a visit to a children's hospital http://t.co/Y2eTHsRdVi pic.twitter.com/BfItCvVp91 \u2014 Digital Spy (@digitalspy) July 9, 2015\n\nJohnny Depp visited sick children in a hospital dressed as his character Captain Jack Sparrow. http://t.co/Qx7l7vHpqg pic.twitter.com/4Aq5bwafGu \u2014 New York Daily News (@NYDailyNews) July 9, 2015\n\nEven though Depp had originally asked people to keep the visit on the down low, photos soon emerged on social media as many of the children asked to take \u201cselfies\u201d with the pirate. Rachel Bennett\u2019s son, Max, had seen all the \u201cPirates of the Carribbean\u201d movies and took several photos with Depp.\n\n\u201cHe was funny,\u201d Max told ABC News. \u201cHe tied a knot in his hair to make a beard, that was my favorite part.\u201d\n\nThe video was filmed by Juice TV, a special initiative for a TV show made by kids in hospitals, for kids in hospitals. Every week, Juiced TV films a 30-minute TV show at Lady Cilento Children\u2019s Hospital. Watch the video and it will be hard not to smile.\n\nSweet!
