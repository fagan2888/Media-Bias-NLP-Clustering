Do you really believe that?\"\n\n\"Well, a lot of people like to say that,\" Carson responded. \"But what I said is that in Nazi Germany, most of those people didn't believe in what Hitler was doing, but did they say anything? They did not. That's what allowed people to progress to that point. We need to be willing to stand up and speak up for what we believe.\"\n\nWallace jumped in: \"But people oppose Barack Obama all the time!\"\n\nThe Fox News host also brought up Carson's claim that Obamacare is the worst thing to happen to the country since slavery.\n\n\"Well, you have to understand what I'm talking about,\" Carson explained. \"You know, Obamacare fundamentally changes the relationship between the people and the government. The government is supposed to respond to the will of the people. Not dictate to the people what they are doing. And with this program, we're allowing that whole paradigm to be switched around.\"\n\nYou do you, Ben Carson. You do you.\n\nAlso on HuffPost: Potential 2016 Presidential Contenders Potential 2016 Presidential Contenders\n\n1 of 33 Former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton (D) Share this slide:\n\nSpencer Platt via Getty Images", "article_metadata": {"description": "Even Chris Wallace is all: I can't even with you, Ben Carson.\n\nThe \"Fox News Sunday\" host", "sailthru.expire_date": "2015-05-11 18:12:06 -0400", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "Even Chris Wallace is all: I can't even with you, Ben Carson.\n\nThe \"Fox News Sunday\" host", "title": "Chris Wallace Calls Out Ben Carson On His Most Outrageous Comments", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/05/10/chris-wallace-ben-carson-fox-news-sunday_n_7252994.html", "image": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2933800/images/o-CHRIS-WALLACE-FOX-NEWS-facebook.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Even Chris Wallace is all: I can't even with you, Ben Carson.\n\nThe \"Fox News Sunday\" host", "creator": "achorowitz", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2933800/images/o-CHRIS-WALLACE-FOX-NEWS-facebook.jpg", "height": 1000}, "title": "Chris Wallace Calls Out Ben Carson On His Most Outrageous Comments", "site": "@HuffPostPol", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-05-10 18:12:06 -0400", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=7252994", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "Chris Wallace,Chris Wallace ben carson,ben Carson,ben carson 2016,Chris Wallace foxs new sunday,Fox News Sunday,ben carson fox news sunday,video", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "Chris Wallace,Chris Wallace ben carson,ben Carson,ben carson 2016,Chris Wallace foxs new sunday,Fox News Sunday,ben carson fox news sunday,video", "published_time": "2015-05-10 18:12:06 -0400", "modified_time": "2015-05-11 14:59:01 -0400"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "article_summary": "Also on HuffPost: Potential 2016 Presidential Contenders Potential 2016 Presidential Contenders1 of 33 Former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton (D) Share this slide:Spencer Platt via Getty Images\nEven Chris Wallace is all: I can't even with you, Ben Carson.\n\"I want to ask you about some remarks you've made that you say that you stand by,\" Wallace said.\nThe \"Fox News Sunday\" host challenged the 2016 presidential candidate on some of his most inflammatory remarks, including Carson's comparing the Obama administration to Hitler's Germany.\n\"Well, a lot of people like to say that,\" Carson responded."}
