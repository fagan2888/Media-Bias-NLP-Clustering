Despite the vapid analysis from the governor on Meet the Press, his backers remind us that he still would have made a great president. His experience and expertise didn\u2019t just represent a missed opportunity for the country, but symbolized America\u2019s panacea. His solutions? That\u2019s irrelevant.\n\nIn semi-retirement, Romney has taken on a persona akin to Uncle Rico from the movie Napoleon Dynamite, a character who constantly laments that if he could only go back in time he\u2019d \u201ctake state,\u201d a suggestion that his fledgling football career fell victim to poor management or simple bad luck. But as the movie progresses we\u2019re told that if only his coach \u201cwoulda put me in fourth quarter, we would\u2019ve been state champions. No doubt. No doubt in my mind.\u201d\n\nRico, still not over his failure to make the grade, blames someone else. According to him, he had what it took. But the harsh \u2013 often heartbreaking reality \u2013 is that really he was never any good. His team was losing with minutes to go and yet his coach knew that making a change would be far more catastrophic than the status quo. For Republicans this is eerily familiar.\n\nMitt Romney is the Uncle Rico of the Republican Party.\n\nBefore his appearance Sunday, Romney took to Facebook reminding his followers that if only President Obama \u201cactually learned the lessons of Massachusetts health care, millions of Americans would not lose the insurance they were promised they could keep, millions more would not see their premiums skyrocket, and the installation of the program would not have been a frustrating embarrassment.\u201d If only.\n\nThis is quite remarkable. Not only was Romney unable to provide a credible defense of Commonwealth Care throughout the election, but a year after Obama defeated him his account of history is still incredibly selective. The facts, unfortunately, are a stinging indictment. Romney called for a national mandate, the most critical aspect of the Affordable Care Act, as recently as 2009. People in Massachusetts, like millions of Americans today, did have their insurance plans canceled. Costs did increase.\n\nFurthermore in his book No Apology, Romney states that comparisons of Commonwealth Care to Obamacare are wide of the mark, because he didn\u2019t propose a public option. After the book\u2019s release, neither did President Obama. But for all the criticism, we\u2019re still seeing the very same Romney from the campaign, spinning his record in office, offering up very little in terms of policy as to what he would have done differently from the president. A man who couldn\u2019t \u2013 or wouldn\u2019t \u2013 offer up his own alternative to Obamacare when the country was screaming out for one may still deserve airtime, but he is not to be taken seriously.\n\nHis supporters welcome his continued presence on the national stage, conveying how the guy was some kind of political Nostradamus. It goes without saying he didn\u2019t get a fair shake in the media, but neither did Ronald Reagan or any other Republican who has run for office. He was certainly correct to warn about Mali, and his assertion that Russia was America\u2019s number one \u201cgeopolitical foe\u201d was correct, but hardly revelatory. The grandstanding by Romney alums over Detroit\u2019s municipal bankruptcy is also patently absurd, especially when the governor spent much of the presidential election distancing his candidacy from that headline.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Ewan Watt", "description": "He was never gonna 'take state'", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "As Tennessee state senator Brian Kelsey\u00a0provided conservatives\u00a0some comic relief late Friday, Twitter feeds quickly brought news to help dampen the mood:\u00a0 Mitt Romney would be continuing his mini-c", "title": "Mitt Romney: The GOP\u2019s Uncle Rico", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2013/11/05/mitt-romney-the-gops-uncle-rico/", "image": {"width": 623, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Romney113-e1383495693279.jpg", "height": 268}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "He was never gonna 'take state'", "title": "Mitt Romney: The GOP\u2019s Uncle Rico Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2013/11/05/mitt-romney-the-gops-uncle-rico/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Romney113-e1383495693279.jpg"}, "creator": "@@ewancwatt", "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-11-05 18:51:23", "sailthru.title": "Mitt Romney: The GOP's Uncle Rico", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "sailthru.tags": "mitt-romney,ewan-watt", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "keywords": "mitt romney", "sailthru.description": "As Tennessee state senator Brian Kelsey\u00a0provided conservatives\u00a0some comic relief late Friday, Twitter feeds quickly brought news to help dampen the mood:\u00a0 Mitt Romney would be continuing his mini-c", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Romney113-e1383495693279.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Mitt Romney is the Uncle Rico of the Republican Party.\nAfter the book\u2019s release, neither did President Obama.\nRomney called for a national mandate, the most critical aspect of the Affordable Care Act, as recently as 2009.\nHis experience and expertise didn\u2019t just represent a missed opportunity for the country, but symbolized America\u2019s panacea.\nFurthermore in his book No Apology, Romney states that comparisons of Commonwealth Care to Obamacare are wide of the mark, because he didn\u2019t propose a public option."}
