NEW YORK -- A newborn boy was left in the manger of an indoor nativity scene at the Holy Child Jesus Church in Queens on Monday afternoon, police say.

The baby boy was found around 1:30 p.m. inside Richmond Hill church, according to WPIX.

The custodian who found the infant told police the manger was empty when he left for lunch and when he returned, he heard a baby crying. That's when he found the baby wrapped in towels inside the manger. The baby's umbilical cord was still attached.

EMS transported the baby to Jamaica Hospital where he is listed in good condition. The police are looking for the mother, who they believe left the baby.

According to the Safe Haven law, a church a considered a safe place to leave an infant within 72 hours of birth, but a responsible person must be in attendance at the time of the drop-off.
