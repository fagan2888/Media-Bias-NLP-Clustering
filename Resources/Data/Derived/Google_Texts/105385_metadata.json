It was the nefarious conservative media, focusing incessantly on the bugaboo of immigration, according to Calmes. While in the aftermath of Mitt Romney\u2019s devastating 2012 presidential defeat, Republicans called for immigration reform. Calmes says, \u201cTwo years later, Republicans\u2019 positions and rhetoric on immigration could not be more contrary to that advice.\u201d\n\nWhy? \u201cOnce allied with but now increasingly hostile to the Republican hierarchy, conservative media is shaping the party\u2019s agenda in ways that are impeding Republicans\u2019 ability to govern and to win presidential elections.\u201d Characterizing such media as \u201cnew voices and scribblers,\u201d Calmes quotes various vaunted Republican ThoughtLeaders, whining over the influence of the unwashed masses represented by the new media.\n\nAs proof of this complaint, Calmes specifically singles out Breitbart News and its focus on immigration enforcement. Calmes cites Rep. Steve King\u2019s (R-IA) op-ed calling for the defeat of Speaker John Boehner in January; King explained, \u201cIf I could command presence on the front page of The New York Times, I\u2019d certainly be happy about that and embrace it. But from a practical perspective, if we want to get a message out, we would be talking to Breitbart, we would be talking to The Washington Times, we\u2019d be \u2013 aside from immigration \u2013 going to The Wall Street Journal.\u201d Calmes also cites the prominence of Iowa radio host Steve Deace as a Breitbart contributor.\n\nCalmes\u2019s study reads like a non-stop whinefest from the Republican establishment over the newfound prominence of conservative media. Whereas before, Republicans could make promises and not be held accountable to them, now conservative media like Breitbart remember those promises and demand that Republicans carry them through. This, apparently, is too much to ask according to the ThoughtLeaders. \u201cIt\u2019s not just talk radio, but the blogosphere, the Internet \u2013 they\u2019re all intertwined now\u2026 [Borrowing money and funding government] are the things that leaders have to get done as part of governing,\u201d tut-tuts former Republican top House aide Dave Schnittger, \u201cas much as conservative media may hate it.\u201d\n\nOne unnamed Republican aide complains, \u201cThere\u2019s no money, ratings or clicks in everyone going along to get along\u2026 the loudest voices drown out the sensible ones and there\u2019s no real space to have serious discussions.\u201d Norman Ornstein of American Enterprise Institute says that today, the \u201cJohn Birth Society types\u201d run the conservative media and, by extension, \u201ccan move into the mainstream and actually hijack a major party.\u201d\n\nMatthew Dowd, a strategist for George W. Bush and favorite of ABC News (although, naturally, Calmes doesn\u2019t mention this credential), believes that the Republican Party can\u2019t moderate the way Democrats supposedly did in the 1980s and 1990s because Democrats \u201cdidn\u2019t have to deal with a quote-unquote liberal media out there that was going to confront them every time they took a turn.\u201d\n\nCalmes blames conservatives, of course, for the losses of Mitt Romney and John McCain, even though by every statistical measure, conservatives showed up for both the 2008 and 2012 elections, and even though the establishment favored both those candidates over more conservative alternatives. And she claims that modern conservative media have become \u201ckooks.\u201d They\u2019re kooks because they don\u2019t agree with the \u201cRepublican insiders\u201d that the party ought to change its positions on \u201cgay rights, insurance for contraceptives, climate change and budget policy, for examples.\u201d\n\nCalmes then turns to the profitability of conservative media, arguing that ratings are down for talk radio, but profits continue because of alliances with advocacy groups. This, she suggests, represents some sort of corrupt arrangement, a Vast Right-Wing Media Conspiracy: \u201cSuch financial deals apparently continue, to the chagrin of establishment Republicans.\u201d And those commentators who benefit from such deals, she writes, quoting Republican strategist John Feehery, \u201cintimidate members of Congress.\u201d\n\nThe entire study represents an elite lament for a time when the political aristocracy decided for Republican voters what their choices ought to be. Conservative media, Calmes says, destroyed that righteous formula. On the left, the argument goes, leftist media do not control Democrats in the same way. This ignores the fact that the left media are not relegated to MSNBC or DailyKos, as Calmes would have it\u2014the left media include CNN, ABC, NBC, CBS, and all the major press outlets. Were there no leftist pressure against Democrats, one would expect a heterogeneous party\u2014instead, the Democratic Party is far more homogeneous than the Republican Party.\n\nNaturally, Republicans are unhappy with the pressure from conservative media. Calmes writes:\n\nThe unanimity among establishment Republicans \u2013 many of them conservatives by the definition of anyone but purists \u2013 that rightwing media has become a big problem for the party, and their readiness to talk about it, was something of a surprise to this reporter of three decades\u2019 experience in Washington. Of the establishment Republicans among several dozen conservatives interviewed, nearly all were flummoxed about how to moderate the party. Most expressed despair. The common hope was that the ultimate 2016 nominee could and would speak truth to power \u2013 the power, that is, of conservative media and their allies in the well-heeled advocacy groups.\n\nGood luck. Calmes may be wrong about most of her study, most of all the supposed dictatorial power of a conservative media that has failed to nominate an alternative candidate in 2008 and 2012 or push Republicans into stopping Obamacare or executive amnesty. But she\u2019s right that conservative media will not stop holding people accountable, no matter what the establishment Republicans would cram down on the base.\n\nBen Shapiro is Senior Editor-At-Large of Breitbart News and author of the book, The People vs. Barack Obama: The Criminal Case Against The Obama Administration (Threshold Editions, June 10, 2014).
