Doug Ducey continues to be in flux.\n\nSenate President Andy Biggs held a series of meetings with members of his Republican caucus Monday, but several senators said there\u2019s no deal yet at hand. Biggs declined to comment.\n\nDucey wants to tap the state\u2019s permanent land trust fund to add about $320 million a year to current spending, which would require a legislative referral to voters. Biggs and House Speaker David Gowan have their own plan to use land trust cash, tobacco tax money and surplus cash. He\u2019s also just floated a plan to ask voters to eliminate required yearly inflations adjustments that are part of a proposition approved in 2000 that boosted sales taxes, bringing the total value of his plan to $5 billion over 10 years.\n\nUsing tobacco tax money, changing Proposition 301 and the trust land raid all require voter approval, and Ducey has publically backed only the land trust plan he floated in June.\n\nSen. Don Shooter, R-Yuma, said after his closed-door meeting with Biggs that he wants to refer all three proposals to voters during a special session. And he agreed with Biggs that boosting school funding by 2 percent a year as required by Proposition 301 is impossible without a tax increase \u2014 which Ducey and Republican legislative leaders consider a non-starter.\n\n\u201cThe problem is I don\u2019t know how you increase expenditures and not increase revenue,\u201d Shooter said. \u201cThat\u2019s just math.\u201d\n\nHouse Republicans will attend closed-door briefings with their leaders Tuesday and Wednesday.\n\nDucey originally planned to bring his proposal to lawmakers when they return in January, but pressure from underfunded schools has led to the special session talk. Adding to the pressure, negotiations to settle a lawsuit brought by schools over the Legislature\u2019s failure to make required inflation increases broke down last month. A judge ordered more than $330 million in new yearly funding, but the Legislature is appealing.\n\nOn Tuesday, Senate and House Democrats plan to roll out their proposal to deal with the school funding crisis.\n\nSenate minority leader Katie Hobbs said there appears to be more problems than immediately evident with the proposals being kicked around in recent weeks \u2014 primarily a lack of GOP votes for Ducey\u2019s plan. And Democrats are holding out for a lawsuit settlement to get their support.\n\n\u201cI think if they could we\u2019d be in special session right now,\u201d Hobbs, a Phoenix Democrat said. \u201cI don\u2019t think (Ducey) wants to deal with anything else, not the Republican proposal, not the inflation lawsuit. So I think if he had the votes, we\u2019d be in session right now.\u201d\n\nShooter said a special session likely won\u2019t come until Ducey returns from a trip to Israel in mid-October.", "article_metadata": {"description": "An anticipated special session of the Arizona Legislature to boost funding for K-12 schools appears at least several weeks away as proposals between Republican legislative leaders and Gov.
