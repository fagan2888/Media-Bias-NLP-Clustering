In particular, the U.S. spends $150 billion annually in hospital overhead alone.\n\nThe study \u2014 which was spearheaded by the City University of New York (CUNY) and the London School of Economics and also included researchers in France, Germany and the Netherlands and published in the September issues of peer review journal Health Affairs \u2014 also found that overhead comprised a little over a quarter (25.3%) of hospital budgets in the U.S. in 2011. What's more, the researchers found that within the U.S., administrative costs were highest (27.2 %) at for-profit hospitals.\n\nRead More: Big Worries Over Health Care, Same Old Rises in Payments\n\nSpecifically , hospital administrative spending totaled $667 per capita in the U.S., $158 in Canada, $164 in Scotland, $211 in Wales, $225 in England and $325 in the Netherlands. Comparable dollar estimates could not be calculated for French and German hospitals because of accounting differences. However, their hospital administration costs were still found to be about 20% higher than in Canada and Scotland, yet still 40% below the U.S. levels.\n\n\"We're squandering $150 billion each year on hospital bureaucracy and $300 billion more is wasted each year on insurance companies' overhead and the paperwork they inflict on doctors,\" study lead author Dr. David Himmelstein, a professor at the CUNY/Hunter College School of Public Health and lecturer at Harvard Medical School, said in a release.", "article_metadata": {"contentType": "article", "layout": "main", "description": "Hospitals in the U.S. spend exorbitant amounts on overhead compared to those in other countries.", "author": "Laura Kiesel", "og": {"site_name": "MainStreet", "description": "Hospitals in the U.S. spend exorbitant amounts on overhead compared to those in other countries.", "title": "Hospital Bureaucracy Costs Billions in Unhealthy Spending", "url": "https://www.mainstreet.com/article/hospital-bureaucracy-costs-billions-in-unhealthy-spending", "image": {"width": 600, "secure_url": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/hospitalroom-large.jpg", "identifier": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/hospitalroom-large.jpg", "height": 400}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "section": "Insurance", "date": "2014-09-22T16:26Z", "fb": {"app_id": 925400040808836}, "keywords": "health care spending, hospital bureaucracy, personal finance, obamacare, affordabel care act, health affairs, H.R. 676, or The Expanded and Improved Medicare for All Act", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MainStreet", "section": "Insurance", "tag": "or The Expanded and Improved Medicare for All Act", "published_time": "2014-09-22T16:26Z", "author": "https://www.mainstreet.com/author/1320112"}, "guid": 12887983, "twitter": {"description": "Hospitals in the U.S. spend exorbitant amounts on overhead compared to those in other countries.", "title": "Hospital Bureaucracy Costs Billions in Unhealthy Spending", "url": "https://www.mainstreet.com/article/hospital-bureaucracy-costs-billions-in-unhealthy-spending", "image": {"src": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/hospitalroom-large.jpg", "identifier": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/hospitalroom-large.jpg"}, "site": "@mainstr", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "health care spending, hospital bureaucracy, personal finance, obamacare, affordabel care act, health affairs, H.R. 676, or The Expanded and Improved Medicare for All Act"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf63e\"", "article_summary": "In particular, the U.S. spends $150 billion annually in hospital overhead alone.\nAccording to new research comparing hospital costs in eight nations, including the United States, Canada, England, Scotland, Wales, the Netherlands, France and Germany, the U.S. spends twice as much on bureaucracy as other nations.\nHowever, their hospital administration costs were still found to be about 20% higher than in Canada and Scotland, yet still 40% below the U.S. levels.\nWhat's more, the researchers found that within the U.S., administrative costs were highest (27.2 %) at for-profit hospitals.\nADVERTISEMENTNEW YORK (MainStreet) \u2014 Hospitals in the U.S. spend exorbitant amounts on overhead compared to those of other countries, and that's causing financial ills for the average American patient."}
