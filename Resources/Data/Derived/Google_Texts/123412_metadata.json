Bobby Jindal would be polling more than 3 percent among likely Iowa GOP caucusgoers.\n\nIt\u2019s too early to count him out, his wife, Supriya Jindal, told a crowd of about 200 in Cedar Rapids on Saturday.\n\n\u201cBobby started out as an asterisk in the polls\u201d when he ran for governor, she said. He won that primary and now is serving a second term.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s early,\u201d said Tom Schott of Tipton. He said it\u2019s too early for many conservatives to lock in a candidate for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of good conservative candidates this year,\u201d he said. This time the election will be leftist socialists versus conservative Republicans, not liberal versus liberal light,\u201d Schott said.\n\nJindal, 44, a former congressman and university system president, made similar points during his hourlong speech and question-and-answer session at the Cedar Rapids Museum of Art.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not enough to send a Republican to the White House,\u201d Jindal said. \u201cWe need to send someone to make big changes.\u201d\n\nThere are Republicans in Washington who are \u201chappy the court ruled the way it ruled (because) they see marriage as a distraction,\u201d Jindal said, referring to the Supreme Court decision allowing same-sex marriage. They\u2019re the same Republicans who \u201cdon\u2019t want to roll up their sleeves and do the hard work to repeal and replace Obamacare.\u201d\n\nThe changes he is calling for are not merely in policy, but in the structure of the federal government that keeps a \u201cpermanent governing class\u201d making rules and laws the rest of Americans have to live under, Jindal said.\n\nHe said structural changes are necessary to ensure that the American dream his parents chased when they emigrated to America will be there for his children and future generations.\n\n\u201cYou tell those Republicans we need to get term limits done; we need to shrink the budget, not just slow the growth; we need to hunt down and kill ISIS, not just contain and degrade them,\u201d Jindal said.\n\nJindal took shots at some of his rivals. He warned against electing another inexperienced, first-term senator \u2014 Texas Sen. Ted Cruz or Florida Sen. Marco Rubio \u2014 because \u201cwe can\u2019t afford on-the-job training.\u201d\n\nHe also took issue with former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush\u2019s comment that a GOP candidate has to be willing to lose the primary to win the general election.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t disagree with that more,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the establishment saying we have to hide our conservative voice; we\u2019ve got to make the left and the media like us. That never works. If we try to do that again, we will lose again and we will deserve to lose again.\u201d\n\nInstead, Jindal called for repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act with a \u201cpatient-driven plan,\u201d securing the Mexican border, shrinking the federal government, growing the private sector and investing in military \u201cso our friends trust us, our enemies fear us.\u201d\n\nIn the end, Jindal asked his audience to do more than join his campaign.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m asking you to join a cause \u2026 to believe again, to believe in America, believe in ourselves,\u201d Jindal said. \u201cI think you want to believe again.\n\n\u201cThis is our time. This is our time to choose,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is time to believe again.\u201d\n\nJindal will speak at 1 p.m. Sunday at the Coralville Public Library, 1401 Fifth St., Meeting Room A.", "article_metadata": {"Description": "The Gazette | CEDAR RAPIDS - Based on the size of the crowd and the enthusiasm it showed for him, it might appear Louisiana Gov.
