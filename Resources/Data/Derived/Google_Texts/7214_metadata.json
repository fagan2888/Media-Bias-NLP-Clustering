It makes sounds like something unearned \u2014 tax credit the correct term. Gundlach is among the 80 percent of customers who qualify for a tax credit to offset cost of coverage bought on the Obamacare exchange. \"It's my own tax money coming back to me. You're only taking what you already paid in,\" he says.\n\nGundlach, 51, is self-employed as a lawyer and certified public accountant. He's also an adjunct professor at Elizabethtown College.\n\n\n\nHe says he has benefited from Obamacare in assorted ways. He lived and worked in Japan for five years before returning to the United States in 2011. He realized that as someone approaching 50 with good but not perfect health, insurers could use pre-existing conditions as a reason to reject him or charge sky high premiums.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act eliminated that worry. Moreover, Gundlach likes being able to go to a single website and shop among an assortment of plans that are certified to meet government standards.\n\nGundlach acknowledges a few headaches. The plan he had in 2015, from Highmark, was discontinued. A similar plan from Highmark cost considerably more. Still, he was able to find a plan from Capital BlueCross that is similar in terms of benefits, for about $70 per month more. He still feels his coverage provides a good value.\n\nGundlach, who has a volunteer role with the Democratic party in Lancaster County, regards Obamacare as a big improvement over the old system.\n\nStill, he would prefer for Medicare to be expanded to cover everyone.", "article_metadata": {"article_author": "David Wenner | dwenner@pennlive.com", "medium": "news", "news_keywords": "Rick Gundlach, health-care, obamacare", "title": "Obamacare user objects to 'subsidy' reference \u2014 it's his own money", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Obamacare user objects to \\u0027subsidy\\u0027 reference \u2014 it\\u0027s his own money \", \"link\": \"http://www.pennlive.com/news/2016/02/obamacare_pros_cons_facts_affo_5.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://image.pennlive.com/home/penn-media/width620/img/news/photo/2016/02/19/19778564-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"18020611\", \"pub_date\": \"2016-02-23T11:34:18Z\", \"author\": \"David Wenner | dwenner@pennlive.com\", \"tags\": [\"@exclude\",\"@papolitics\",\"health-care\",\"obamacare\"] }", "twitter": {"site": "@pennlive", "image": "http://image.pennlive.com/home/penn-media/width620/img/news/photo/2016/02/19/19778564-standard.jpg", "description": "It's a big improvement over the old health insurance market, user says", "card": "summary", "creator": "@DavidRWenner"}, "article_date_updated": "Tuesday, February 23, 2016,  9:11 AM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"short_title\": \"\", \"image_url\": \"http://media.pennlive.com/news/photo/2016/02/19/rick-gundlach-dadd8148143ba096.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"dwenner\", \"author_nickname\": \"David Wenner | dwenner@pennlive.com\", \"author_id\": \"569\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Real-Time News from PennLive\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.pennlive.com/news/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "PennLive.com", "description": "It's a big improvement over the old health insurance market, user says", "title": "Obamacare user objects to 'subsidy' reference \u2014 it's his own money", "url": "http://www.pennlive.com/news/2016/02/obamacare_pros_cons_facts_affo_5.html", "image": "http://image.pennlive.com/home/penn-media/width620/img/news/photo/2016/02/19/19778564-standard.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "PennLive.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Tuesday, February 23, 2016,  6:30 AM", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "Description": "It's a big improvement over the old health insurance market, user says"}, "article_summary": "Rick Gundlach doesn't like hearing the word \"subsidy\" attached to Obamacare coverage.\nIt makes sounds like something unearned \u2014 tax credit the correct term.\nGundlach is among the 80 percent of customers who qualify for a tax credit to offset cost of coverage bought on the Obamacare exchange.\nA similar plan from Highmark cost considerably more.\nGundlach, who has a volunteer role with the Democratic party in Lancaster County, regards Obamacare as a big improvement over the old system."}
