Nordgren\u2019s team, the Topeka Old Phogies, won first place in the 10-person team division of the competition, which involves more than 50,000 riders.\n\nAmong the two girls Norgren will be riding for:\n\n\u25a0 Karis, the daughter of Kyle and Stephanie Selk, of Topeka, was diagnosed at age 5 with medulloblastoma, the most common type of brain cancer found in children. When she was diagnosed, Karis had three tumors in her brain, and the cancer had metastasized to her spine. She has undergone two brain surgeries, 30 radiation treatments and chemotherapy.\n\n\u25a0 Londyn, the daughter of Danielle Hibbert, of Topeka, was diagnosed at the age of 9 months with the hereditary form of a rare form of childhood cancer, bilateral retinoblastoma. She has undergone chemotherapy, received prosthetics to replace her left eye and has three tumors remaining in her right eye.\n\nNordgren said tax-deductible donations may be made:\n\n\u25a0 On a Facebook site, which can be found using the keywords Karis and Londyn Cancer Support.\n\n\u25a0 By sending an email to Nordgren at aspentopeka@sbcglobal.net.
