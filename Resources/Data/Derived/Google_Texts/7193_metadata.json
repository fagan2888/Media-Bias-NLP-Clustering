The toxins could possibly trigger a child\u2019s genetic predisposition to the neurodevelopmental disorder. Styrene in particular, which is found in car exhaust, was shown to double the risk.\n\nThe researchers interviewed 217 families of children who had autism spectrum disorder (ASD), then compared them with two different sets of families who had kids without ASD. All of the children \u2014 whether autistic or not \u2014 had been born within the same time period and in the same six counties in Pennsylvania. The researchers used the U.S. National Air Toxics Assessment to get an idea of what potential pollutants to which the kids may have been exposed, and found that styrene, chromium, and cyanide were all seemingly associated with ASD.\n\nBut the researchers are wary of making any clear-cut conclusions about autism and its potential link to air pollution. Why one child may develop autism, while another exposed to the same chemicals would not, are questions that are still not fully answered. \u201cThese findings are preliminary,\u201d Evelyn Talbott, lead author of the study and a professor of epidemiology, said according to HealthDay. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what causes autism. We have little information on risk factors. This is just one more piece of the puzzle.\u201d\n\nResearchers currently agree that it\u2019s very difficult to pinpoint the factors that may lead to autism, but it\u2019s most likely a combination of genetics and environment. \u201cMore and more, people are believing in gene/environment interactions,\u201d Talbott said. \u201cWe do know that about 10 percent of autism spectrum disorders run in families.\u201d\n\nLast year, another study out of the Harvard School of Public Health pinpointed a similar association between autism and air pollution. This 2013 study was the first national study to fully attempt to examine this link. \u201cWomen who were exposed to the highest levels of diesel or mercury in the air were twice as likely to have a child with autism than women who lived in the cleanest parts of the sample,\u201d Andrea Roberts, an author of the study and a research associate at Harvard, told the Huffington Post. \u201cAll of the chemicals studied are known neurotoxins. They are also known to pass from mother to baby while a woman is pregnant. It\u2019s very plausible that the \u2018stuff\u2019 the mother is taking in through the air is affecting her baby\u2019s brain development.\u201d\n\nBut researchers remain wary, noting that there is not enough evidence to draw any conclusions about these associations. To what extent inheritance, genes, upbringing, and environment all play a role in the development of autism has yet to be fully understood.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "autism and air pollution, autism", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A new study has identified two air toxins as potential risk factors for autism.", "title": "A Child\u2019s Autism Risk May Increase With Exposure To These Pollutants", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/airborne-pollutants-and-autism-exposure-chromium-styrene-may-increase-risk-infants-307972", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/25/autism.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A new study has identified two air toxins as potential risk factors for autism.", "title": "A Child\u2019s Autism Risk May Increase With Exposure To These Pollutants", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/airborne-pollutants-and-autism-exposure-chromium-styrene-may-increase-risk-infants-307972", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/25/autism.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/25/autism.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Conditions", "published_time": "2014-10-25T17:51:33-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-25T18:14:27-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A new study has identified two air toxins as potential risk factors for autism."}, "article_summary": "But the researchers are wary of making any clear-cut conclusions about autism and its potential link to air pollution.\nStyrene in particular, which is found in car exhaust, was shown to double the risk.\nIf children are exposed to chromium and styrene while in the womb or during their first two years of life, they may have an increased risk by up to 65 percent, the study found.\nThe risk factors and potential causes of autism are still unclear and not fully understood, but researchers are beginning to examine the link between air pollution and the disorder.\nAccording to new research out of the University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health, kids that have been exposed to two air pollutants, chromium and styrene, may have an increased risk of developing autism."}
