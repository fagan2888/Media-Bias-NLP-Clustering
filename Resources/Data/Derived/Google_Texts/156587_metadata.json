Auditors and lawyers will begin structured, even forensic work, to determine what went wrong and why Maryland\u2019s exchange fared so much worse than those in other states.\n\nHayward looks at the surprising scope and nature of damages of the failure and explains why both the state and its contractor Noridian bear responsibility. He predicts resolution could be complex, costly, and time consuming.\n\nHayward also offers two alternatives (a $51.4 million performance bond or arbitration) to taking the dispute to court, arguing that all parties should avoid litigation.\n\nClick here for Part I on failures of leadership.\n\nBy Charlie Hayward\n\nCharlieHayward@MarylandReporter.com\n\nObamacare\u2019s 2015 enrollment cycle is just around the corner; new enrollment begins in seven months, on Nov. 15. We can be assured that the spin will intensify via taxpayer-funded marketing aimed at rebuilding the damaged health exchange brand that will begin early and be repeated ad nauseam. Press releases and public statements will abound.\n\nWe\u2019ll hear Maryland\u2019s inaugural enrollment year was a seminal achievement, and the exchange and its agents deserve high praise for heroic efforts meeting signup goals against all odds. And ambitious IT projects go bad all the time. We learned our lesson, just look at the costs we are saving by our prudent decision to launch another state\u2019s already-proven website.\n\nBut questions will continue to swirl. If IT projects go bad all the time, why did Connecticut\u2019s succeed?\n\nAuditors, lawyers behind the scenes\n\nBehind the scenes, meanwhile, auditors (and lawyers involved with the dispute resolution) will quietly grind on with their structured, even forensic, work\u2014ultimately laying bare imprudent conduct. The audits will be methodical, politically neutral, and entail unfettered access to documents, but will not be the final word because audit recommendations are advisory; final decisions rest with agency heads.\n\nEvery indication so far is that the exchange and other state officials will cooperate fully. Here\u2019s where the various audits and investigations stand, and a bit about the differences among them:\n\nThe state\u2019s Office of Legislative Audits (OLA) will perform two audits. A fiscal audit will evaluate internal control surrounding how money was spent and evaluate if spending followed prevailing laws and regulations. A performance audit will assess relative costs and benefits and whether the state produced intended results or other effects that were outside Obamacare\u2019s objectives. Fieldwork will begin this summer but OLA\u2019s reports will not be issued until about mid-2015.\n\nOffice of Inspector General in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services began its audit last month. Auditors will evaluate internal control over spending and procurement, reasonableness of costs, and whether the state complied with grant requirements. The inspector general\u2019s office also will evaluate compliance by federal employees with a myriad of laws and regulations requiring the federal government to be a good steward of taxpayer resources. Thus, the inspector general\u2019s office can evaluate HHS\u2019 decision to pay for the state\u2019s claims that millions paid to Optum/QSSI and Deloitte are somehow eligible under the 2012 \u201cLevel Two\u201d cooperative agreement/grant.\n\nIf the inspector general\u2019s office concludes the state claimed unallowable costs it can recommend reductions to grant funding and funding recovery. The inspector general\u2019s office expects to issue its report by December 2014.\n\nNoridian and the state attorney general (AG) will conduct forensic investigations principally designed to defend their side and blame the other. All-out litigation seems likely based on the respective sides\u2019 latest public statements. The results of the forensic work will be published in court filings to be entered after the six-month \u201cstandstill\u201d period (wherein the state and Noridian agree not to sue) ends in about five months.\n\nEach side has major culpability, yet incredibly each will admit little and blame the other. Noridian\u2019s version will assert that the federal government made too many last-minute demands. And that Noridian has limited or no liability based on a long list of extra-contractual, conflicting direction from the state.\n\nWho Was Damaged?\n\nThis whole affair caused widespread damage; far more than most people realize. One of the most improbable examples is a real concern that Noridian\u2019s problems in Maryland could raise insurance rates in North Dakota. Consumers and prospects that never signed up were adversely affected by a website that was never capable of processing any enrollments except those with the most basic, cookie-cutter information.\n\nIn Maryland, the ill effects weren\u2019t limited to $200 million or so spent unnecessarily by the exchange; costs were incurred unnecessarily in many other places:\n\nSeveral of the state\u2019s departments and agencies that are business partners of the exchange are likely to have incurred millions unnecessarily. To wit: the exchange\u2019s parent organization, DHMH, and the Department of Human Resources, which manages other social-service programs for the disadvantaged whose eligibility determinations were supposed to be transferred to the exchange software platform. The state\u2019s Office of Attorney General is incurring expenses to study the Noridian dispute, and may need to hire outside counsel if it goes to court.\n\nFederal partners spent big money to cope with Maryland\u2019s website problems. They are now assessing tens of millions of fresh grant money to underwrite the state\u2019s second attempt at creating an acceptable website.\n\nPrivate business partners\u2014i.e., the insurance carriers (CareFirst, Evergreen, KaiserPermanente, UnitedHealth) incurred substantial unplanned costs. Corporate shareholders seem to be on the hook because of Obamacare\u2019s 20% cap on insurers\u2019 administrative costs.\n\nAnd millions of taxpayer-funded damages will continue to accrue, probably not ending until 2015 or 2016. For instance, taxpayers will foot the state\u2019s legal bills and could be on the hook for contractors\u2019 legal costs. How will restitution play out?\n\nEnter the Lawyers\n\nThe state can\u2019t walk away from the wreckage of its failed website and the bonfire of taxpayer dollars. The state must advance a multi-pronged battle to justify its conduct, protect its interests and preserve its claims\u2014all consistent with its position that Noridian deserves almost exclusive blame for its opportunistic bid and incompetent performance.\n\nPresumably, the state will convey (prior to litigation) a settlement proposal to Noridian. To do so, the exchange must first compile specific damages. But while damages can be described, many can\u2019t be readily quantified. Some that can be quantified cannot be recovered. In theory, damages fall within three categories: direct, indirect, and consequential. They include:\n\nDirect\n\n1. Unnecessary re-work due to two exchange platform builds.\n\n2. Manual workarounds by the exchange and countless (more than a dozen) business partners due to website dysfunction.\n\n3. Computer programming incurred between October 1 to date to triage the platform, not fix it. (The site has not shut down yet).\n\nIndirect\n\nExecutive and administrative costs incurred by the exchange, DHMH, Maryland Insurance Administration, DHR and, to a lesser extent, other state agencies.\n\nConsequential\n\n1. Wasted marketing\u2014including brand-building, product sales and, after the launch, damage control.\n\n2. Reputational damage.\n\n3. Compromised enrollment numbers.\n\nThe litigation will be complex because there is so much contributory negligence on each party. A jury would need to decide what compensation is due Noridian versus what the state paid, who is responsible and what damages are owed.\n\nAccording to Noridian, the exchange directed it to make material changes to work not required by the fixed-price contract. Some of these changes were reductions to work for the sake of salvaging key functionality when it became apparent time would otherwise run out to meet the Oct. 1 deadline. Such reductions (and additions) should have been formalized in \u201cdeductive\u201d change orders in Noridian\u2019s contract price.\n\nWere all those change orders formalized? If Noridian\u2019s claims are accurate, then no change orders were negotiated. And now equitably pricing them will be made far more difficult because negotiations will be wrapped into the larger dispute.\n\nThe state\u2019s principal claims will be against Noridian. Since Noridian\u2019s key subcontractors are culpable, the parties\u2019 lawyers will need to file several layers of arguments required by rules of civil procedure such that all parties are called to answer for their conduct. Expect a full complement of court filings: claims, counterclaims, cross-claims and counter-cross claims involving Noridian\u2019s key subcontractors, particularly IBM and EngagePoint.\n\nIf litigation commences, risks to the opposing parties are substantial because each of the principal parties is deeply responsible. The legal arguments will seem one-sided and objectively unsound to laypeople that aren\u2019t familiar with the arcane legal criteria relevant to this mess. Taxpayers will pay for the state\u2019s costs of this charade, unless litigation can be avoided.\n\nHow Will This End?\n\nNo one knows, but this could get ugly. O\u2019Malley says he will \u201c\u2026see IBM in court.\u201d Did he speak out of anger, or has the AG excluded all reasonable alternatives?\n\nLitigation should be proceeding only as a last resort. A concept in philosophy known as Occam\u2019s razor says it is wrong to attempt to employ complex means when simple ones suffice.\n\nNoridian was required to maintain a performance bond, a form of insurance that would take effect if Noridian failed to complete work to the state\u2019s satisfaction. The bond was required in the full amount of Noridian\u2019s contract, $51.4 million.\n\nSince the state has publically cast blame on Noridian, why doesn\u2019t it send a $51 million bill to the surety bond holder?\n\nIt isn\u2019t that simple. To collect, the state has several legal hurdles designed in law to protect the surety; the state must inform the surety bond holder on a timely basis of all significant changes to the scope of Noridian\u2019s work; and convey timely notification of Noridian\u2019s default; refrain from making progress payments for work not completed; and avoid paying for defective work.\n\nThe performance bond was a valuable option for the state, especially if there was any reasonable possibility Noridian might declare bankruptcy. So the exchange had an absolute duty to preserve all rights of collecting from the insurance company by ensuring none of the surety\u2019s defenses could be raised.\n\nIf the state didn\u2019t preserve all rights of collection, then either it must have justification, or the auditors may conclude the state was negligent. This would have the effect of putting state taxpayers on the hook.\n\nThe evidence suggests skepticism is needed about the exchange\u2019s diligence in collecting on the policy. The requirement for this insurance ended at the time Noridian was dismissed. A source in the exchange told me Noridian\u2019s dismissal was not done via formal letter. Noridian was terminated in a phone call.\n\nBinding arbitration may be another option to litigation. However, the parties would need to negotiate conditions because arbitration is not provided in Noridian\u2019s contract.\n\nIn the end, the state has a duty to maximize recovery, minimize legal and other costs and resolve this matter as soon as possible. It won\u2019t be easy.\n\nCharlie Hayward spent more than 30 years performing Government Accountability Office full-scope \u201cyellowbook\u201d audits and served as a partner in two accounting firms.
