Psychedelic drugs are being explored as a treatment, but research is still scarce.\n\nThe \u201cworst pain known to medical science\u201d is an impossible thing to quantify, though many sufferers of cluster headaches are quick to describe their condition according to this elusive empiric standard. Here are some the ways the pain of clusters has been described to me: \u201cLike a really really strong pressure, and then there\u2019s a kind of burning sensation.\u201d\n\n\u201cSomeone\u2019s jabbed a white-hot poker into your eye socket and is holding it there for 45 minutes to an hour and a half.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike I just got shot in the face.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a papercut in my eye, in the center of my head.\u201d\n\n\u201cA pain that's so sharp and excruciating, there's no talking or doing anything other than just screaming to try to get out of it.\"\n\n\u201cIt makes you want to get up and literally run from the pain.\u201d Sufferers and doctors alike want to make clear the distinction: though they\u2019re called \u201cheadaches,\u201d clusters are not like migraines. The pain of a cluster headache is one-sided, typically concentrated around the eye and the temple, but can sometimes spread to other areas. On the affected side, the eye tears up and may droop, the nose can get congested. A headache will last between half an hour and two hours, and true to their name, they come in clusters\u2014one or more times a day, often at the same time each day for a cycle that can last a few weeks, or a few months. Episodic sufferers get breaks of 30 days or more between their cycles; chronic sufferers get shorter breaks, or sometimes, no break at all.\n\nIt\u2019s not a new disorder\u2014in 1745, the Dutch-Austrian physician Gerhard van Swieten described a patient who seems to be suffering from cluster headaches: \u201cA healthy, robust man of middle age was, each day, at the same hour troubled by pain above the orbit of the left eye, where the nerve leaves through the bony frontal opening; after a short time the left eye began to redden and tears to flow; then he felt as if his eye was protruding from its orbit with so much pain that he became mad. After a few hours all this evil ceased and nothing in the eye appeared at all changed.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s something very rhythmic about cluster,\u201d says Dr. Mark Green, professor of neurology at the Mt. Sinai School of Medicine and director of the school\u2019s Center for Headache and Pain Medicine. \u201cSomeone may come in and say \u2018at 4:15 a.m. every morning, I get an attack.\u2019 We used to call them alarm clock headaches, they were so regular.\u201d Though scientists don\u2019t know exactly what causes cluster headaches, the condition seems to involve the hypothalamus\u2014the part of the brain responsible for circadian rhythms. According to the World Health Organization, the condition affects one in 1000 adults\u2014clusters usually start for people when they\u2019re in their 20s, or older. Cindy Reynolds got her first cluster headache a little earlier than most. \u201cI was 15,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was a wonderful day, I had just made cheerleading. I was super excited. I spent the night with a girlfriend and woke up in excruciating pain, screaming.\u201d After about a year, which included many trips to the hospital for MRIs and CT scans, she was diagnosed with episodic cluster headaches. Today, Cindy, now 52 years old, has been chronic for five and a half years. Due to the rarity of the condition, \u201cso many of the people I see with clusters are misdiagnosed,\u201d Green says. \u201cThey\u2019re told they have migraines or they\u2019re told they have sinus headaches or some other thing.\u201d \"Most headache doctors have had patients with cluster headaches who have committed suicide from the pain.\" Mike Scott, 42, thought for years that he was suffering from sinus headaches. \u201cIt typically happened in the fall or the spring, and they would happen day after day for a while, so I assumed there was some kind of pollen or allergen or something that I was reacting to,\u201d he says. In his 30s, his formerly manageable headaches got worse, and he found out about clusters by Googling his symptoms.\n\nCluster headaches are also known, colloquially, as \u201csuicide headaches.\u201d Green confirms that \u201cmost headache doctors have had patients with cluster headaches who have committed suicide from the pain\u2026That\u2019s more likely in the chronic form, [when] they know that they\u2019re going to get one or two or three of these headaches, every day, forever. It\u2019s pretty awful to anticipate that.\u201d Green remembers one 80-year-old cluster headache patient of his who also had heart disease. Because of that, he didn\u2019t want to prescribe a certain type of injection that can sometimes stop the pain. \u201cHe owns a gun and threatened suicide without them,\u201d Green says. The patient has since \u201cdone well, and understands the risks,\u201d he says. Of the notion that it\u2019s the \u201cworst pain known to medical science,\u201d though, Green says, \u201cI think they\u2019re terrible. I think sometimes people can get a little carried away.\u201d Even in less extreme circumstances, sufferers say the severity of the pain has changed their lives. Both Scott and Reynolds say their bosses are understanding of their conditions, and allow them to work from home. But they, and Green, know people who are unable to work because of the headaches. Scott has had attacks while driving\u2014particularly dangerous because of the tearing and blurring of vision that occurs. And, he says, \u201cit\u2019s really affected my daughter. Now any time I grimace or put my hand to my face or anything, she says, \u2018Dad, are you getting a cluster?\u2019 She\u2019s so worried about it, it just breaks her heart to see me suffering.\u201d Reynolds, a chronic patient, says, \u201cif I could write a book on how to get through this, I would model it after the Alcoholics Anonymous guidebook\u2026It\u2019s just too hard to explain the severity of the pain and how it takes over your life [when] you\u2019re in a cycle. I would incorporate the five stages of grief, for sure. And then how you come to understand how to live with this.\u201d To live with her headaches, Cindy uses breathable oxygen, as needed. She is a believer in alternative medicine, she says. Though other cluster patients may use oxygen, too, they typically also use some sort of preventative medication, such as verapamil, and something to try to stop the pain while they\u2019re having it. Scott stockpiles Imitrex injections for this purpose\u2014he says his insurance company gives him a limited number each month, which isn\u2019t enough if he\u2019s having multiple headaches every day during a cycle. So he gets his prescription filled even when he\u2019s in an off period, and saves the injections for when he needs them. A couple doses of psilocybin mushrooms, a Schedule I drug, broke a cycle he'd been stuck in for months, when nothing else could. For Bob Wold, founder of the non-profit cluster headache research and advocacy organization, Clusterbusters, none of the medications he tried worked. \u201cAll of the different medications that people use for clusters are hand-me-downs, usually from migraine treatments, anti-seizure medications, or blood pressure medications\u2026I had pretty much tried all of the different medications that were available, and so I was contemplating having gamma knife surgery. They clamp your head down and shoot radiation into your brain, killing off part of your brain. I had been approved for that surgery at Northwestern.\u201d He decided to try one last thing first, something he\u2019d read about online. A couple doses of psilocybin mushrooms, which are classified as a Schedule I drug, broke a cycle he says he\u2019d been stuck in for months, when nothing else could.\n\n\u201cI canceled the surgery and haven\u2019t looked back since,\u201d he says. Clusterbusters was born from this idea, and anecdotal evidence of many cluster patients who used psilocybin or LSD to successfully stop their headaches. The organization incorporated in 2002, with the goal, Wold says, of starting more research into this treatment option, which the community calls \u201cbusting.\u201d \u201cOver the last 10 years, I have talked to thousands of people that have used these treatments, and for the most part, when people try them, they usually never go back to conventional medication,\u201d Wold says. He also notes that the dose required for treatment is not enough to cause someone to hallucinate\u2014\u201cit\u2019s normally starting off at approximately a quarter of a recreational dose,\u201d he says. Clusterbusters partnered with researchers at Harvard University, and published a case series in the journal Neurology, in which they interviewed 53 cluster patients who used LSD or psilocybin to treat their headaches. Most found the treatment effective in stopping the headaches and lengthening the remission periods between cycles. A small pilot study\u2014just five people\u2014followed, in Germany, where researchers used bromo-LSD, a non-hallucinogenic form of the molecule. It was 100 percent successful, Wold says. Green is slightly less enthusiastic about the treatment. \u201cNo one should quote the efficacy of the trials, because they\u2019re ongoing,\u201d he says. Research on hallucinogenic treatments is now at the point where it would need a larger clinical trial, and Clusterbusters has branched out into other research, including working with Yale University on surveying the efficacy of the many medications cluster headache patients use. The organization is also working on getting a genetic study underway to investigate the possibility that the headaches come from expression of a certain gene. Wold says some of the researchers he\u2019s worked with \u201cthink it may be an epigenetic effect, that [the psychedelics are] actually changing the way the genes express themselves, telling your body to stop sending the signal for cluster headaches.\u201d Related Story Cephalgiaphobia: When the Fear of Headaches Causes Headaches Clusterbusters has become a hub for the cluster headache community\u2019s advocacy work as well. The organization worked with the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) to develop a fact sheet on cluster headaches for workers on their suicide hotlines. Partnering with the Alliance for Headache Disorders Advocacy, Clusterbusters has sent a delegation to an event in Washington, D.C. called \u201cHeadache on the Hill\u201d for the past two years. There they arrange visits with senators, congressmen, and government agencies, asking for more funding for research.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The rare \"suicide headache\" is lesser-known than migraines, widely misunderstood, and often described as the worst pain known to humans.
