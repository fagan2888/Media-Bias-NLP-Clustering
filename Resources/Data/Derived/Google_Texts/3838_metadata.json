Mark Begich makes the bogus claim in two ads that he \u201cvoted against President Obama\u2019s trillion-dollar tax increase.\u201d Actually, he voted against a GOP resolution that set forth Obama\u2019s spending levels for fiscal year 2013 but without the president\u2019s policy language. The Democrats derided the resolution as a political stunt, and it failed 0-99.\n\nThe faux budget vote came in May 2012. Less than eight months later, Congress passed bipartisan legislation \u2014 the American Taxpayer Relief Act \u2014 to address the so-called fiscal cliff that contained some of the same tax hikes proposed in Obama\u2019s fiscal year 2013 budget. Begich voted for that bill.\n\nThe latest ad, \u201cTwo Views,\u201d features Begich\u2019s wife, Deborah, and mother, Pegge, disagreeing over whether the senator is \u201ccheap,\u201d as his wife describes him, or \u201cfrugal,\u201d as his mother calls him. Kantar Media Intelligence\u2019s Campaign Media Analysis Group, which tracks political ads, says the ad ran 18 of 19 days from Sept. 18 to Oct. 6.\n\nAt one point, Begich\u2019s mom says: \u201cHe voted against President Obama\u2019s trillion-dollar tax increase.\u201d The same claim is made in another ad the Begich campaign calls \u201cReprise,\u201d which CMAG says ran for more than two weeks through the end of September.\n\nThe fine print on the screen of both ads cites Senate roll call vote 97 on May 16, 2012. That was a vote on a motion to advance Senate Concurrent Resolution 41, a nonbinding budget resolution introduced on April 17, 2012, by Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama. It carried the cumbersome title, \u201cA concurrent resolution setting forth the President\u2019s budget request for the United States Government for fiscal year 2013, and setting forth the appropriate budgetary levels for fiscal years 2014 through 2022.\u201d The resolution did not contain Obama\u2019s policy language \u2014 not even on his tax proposals. It simply laid out the spending levels, assuming higher revenues without specifying how they would be achieved.\n\nThe GOP-sponsored resolution was dismissed by Democrats as \u201cnot even serious,\u201d as Sen. Tom Harkin put it during the floor debate.\n\nPrior to the vote, Democratic Sen. Kent Conrad held up the president\u2019s budget proposal and Sessions\u2019 resolution \u2014 \u201cwhat Sen. Sessions describes as the president\u2019s budget\u201d \u2014 to make the point that there is a \u201cbig difference\u201d between the two. \u201cThis is not the president\u2019s budget, so of course we are not going to support it,\u201d Conrad said.\n\nThe resolution was defeated 0-99. In a news story on the vote, Politico described it as a \u201cpolitical vote\u201d that is \u201csure to become fodder for campaign ads.\u201d Indeed, it has.\n\nThe president\u2019s actual budget proposal, which was released about three months before the Senate vote on the Sessions resolution, contained roughly $1.5 trillion in tax increases, according to a CNN article cited by the Begich campaign in its supporting document for the \u201cTwo Views\u201d ad.\n\nCNN, Feb. 13, 2012: The budget also raises taxes by $1.5 trillion, including a provision to allow the expiration of Bush-era tax cuts on families earning more than $250,000 a year, as well as incorporating the so-called Buffett Rule that requires households earning more than $1 million to pay a 30% tax rate.\n\nLess than eight months later, Obama was able to convince Congress to allow the Bush-era tax cuts to expire for the nation\u2019s wealthiest taxpayers.\n\nIn a bipartisan compromise, Obama and Republican leaders agreed to allow the top income tax rate to return to the pre-Bush level of 39.6 percent, up from 35 percent, for individuals earning more than $400,000 and families earning more than $450,000. They also agreed to increase the estate tax from 35 percent to 40 percent, and reduce the value of itemized deductions and other tax preferences for those earning more than $250,000 and families earning more than $300,000. The tax increases were part of the American Taxpayer Relief Act, which addressed the so-called fiscal cliff that threatened to plunge the nation into a recession. The administration said it raised taxes by $618 billion over 10 years.\n\nBegich voted for that fiscal cliff deal, which overwhelmingly passed the Senate 89-8 on Jan. 1, 2013.\n\nAlthough this is not mentioned in the TV ad, the campaign provides one other piece of evidence for its claim that Begich voted against \u201cPresident Obama\u2019s $1 trillion tax increase,\u201d and that\u2019s Begich\u2019s vote a year later against the Senate Democrats\u2019 budget proposal for fiscal year 2014. That budget resolution included a $1 trillion increase in taxes, and it passed by the slimmest possible margin, 50-49, on March 23, 2013, without Begich\u2019s vote.\n\n\u201cJoining all Republicans voting no were four Democrats who face re-election next year in potentially difficult races: Sens. Max Baucus of Montana, Mark Begich of Alaska, Kay Hagan of North Carolina and Mark Pryor of Arkansas,\u201d the Associated Press reported at the time.\n\nBut that wasn\u2019t a vote against \u201cPresident Obama\u2019s $1 trillion tax increase.\u201d The resolution was proposed by Democratic Sen. Patty Murray, chairwoman of the Senate Budget Committee. The White House welcomed the Senate proposal, releasing a statement that said in part: \u201cThe President has put a plan on the table that reflects compromise, and he will continue to work with both sides to see if there is an opportunity to reach a solution to our budget challenges. We hope we will find this compromise because that is what the American people expect and what they deserve.\u201d\n\nUltimately, Ryan and Murray agreed on a bipartisan compromise that did not raise taxes.\n\nThe Begich ads could have said that he voted against his own party\u2019s plan to raise taxes $1 trillion. But that\u2019s not what the ads say, and even then, it would have been accurate only in this particular instance. Begich did vote with his party to raise taxes by $1 trillion in the Affordable Care Act. He also, as we mentioned earlier, voted for tax increases in the bipartisan fiscal cliff deal.\n\nCorrection, Oct. 10: An earlier version of this story gave the wrong month for the vote on the budget resolution sponsored by Sessions. It was in May 2012.\n\nAlso on HuffPost: Shirtless Politicians Shirtless Politicians\n\n1 of 10 Anthony Weiner This image obtained by BigGovernment.com shows Representative Anthony Weiner shirtless.
