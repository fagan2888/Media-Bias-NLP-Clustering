President Obama\u2019s temporary amnesty, which lasts three years, declares up to 5 million illegal immigrants to be lawfully in the country and eligible for work permits, but it still deems them ineligible for public benefits such as buying insurance on Obamacare\u2019s health exchanges. Under the Affordable Care Act, that means businesses who hire them won\u2019t have to pay a penalty for not providing them health coverage \u2014 making them $3,000 more attractive than a similar native-born worker, whom the business by law would have to cover. [...] A Department of Homeland Security official confirmed that the newly legalized immigrants won\u2019t have access to Obamacare, which opens up the loophole for employers looking to avoid the penalty. The Health and Human Services Department, which oversees Obamacare, referred questions to the White House, which didn\u2019t reply to a request for comment.\n\n\u201cIf it is true that the president\u2019s actions give employers a $3,000 incentive to hire those who came here illegally, he has added insult to injury,\u201d Rep. Lamar Smith (R-TX) told the Times. \u201cThe president\u2019s actions would have just moved those who came here illegally to the front of the line, ahead of unemployed and underemployed Americans.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Obama maintains that bringing undocumented workers into the workforce is a good thing.\n\n\u201cImmigrants are good for the economy,\u201d he said in Chicago on Tuesday. \u201cWe keep on hearing that they\u2019re bad, but a report by my Council of Economic Advisers put out last week shows how the actions we\u2019re taking will grow our economy for everybody.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m sure those in the unemployment line would beg to differ.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Head meet desk. .05/25/2016 23:53:34PM EST.", "author": "Leah Barkoukis", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Head meet desk.", "title": "Leah Barkoukis - Report: Businesses Will Receive $3,000 Per Employee For Hiring Illegal Immigrants", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/leahbarkoukis/2014/11/27/report-businesses-to-receive-incentive-for-hiring-illegal-immigrants-n1924265", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2011/189/31d937f5-a340-430b-b204-7dae1d3f8d93.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Head meet desk.", "title": "Leah Barkoukis - Report: Businesses Will Receive $3,000 Per Employee For Hiring Illegal Immigrants", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/leahbarkoukis/2014/11/27/report-businesses-to-receive-incentive-for-hiring-illegal-immigrants-n1924265", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2011/189/31d937f5-a340-430b-b204-7dae1d3f8d93.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Report: Businesses Will Receive $3,000 Per Employee For Hiring Illegal Immigrants , Leah Barkoukis, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1faf\"", "article_summary": "The Washington Times reports:Under the president\u2019s new amnesty, businesses will have a $3,000-per-employee incentive to hire illegal immigrants over native-born workers because of a quirk of Obamacare.\nAs if President Obama\u2019s executive amnesty wasn\u2019t already a slap in the face to out-of-work Americans, thanks to a loophole in Obamacare, it looks like businesses will actually have a financial incentive for hiring illegal immigrants.\n\u201cIf it is true that the president\u2019s actions give employers a $3,000 incentive to hire those who came here illegally, he has added insult to injury,\u201d Rep.
