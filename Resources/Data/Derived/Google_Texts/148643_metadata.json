The election commissioner is expecting about a 15 percent voter turnout for the general election.\n\nRegistered voters in Kansas can vote in Tuesday\u2019s general election. Advance ballots can be cast from 8 a.m. to noon Monday at the election office, 911 S.W. 37th. Advance voting ends at noon, according to the secretary of state\u2019s website.\n\nThose who want to vote by mail must have their ballots returned to the election office before the polls close at 7 p.m. Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThese ballots must be in the possession of the election office by the time the polls close on election day,\u201d Howell said in a news release. \u201cHand delivery is acceptable. The election office cannot guarantee US Postal Service delivery times, so voters should be mindful of that when mailing ballots back to the office. Sometimes it takes a while, and we cannot accept any ballots after 7 p.m.\u201d\n\nPolling places, which will offer paper ballots or an electronic voting machine, will be open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. Tuesday.\n\nThere is a 30-percent chance for thunderstorms Tuesday. However, temperatures will be mild, with an expected high of 77 degrees.\n\nWhile state law requires voters to show identification, those without ID have the option of casting a provisional ballot. Provisional ballots will be counted if a voter \u2014 prior to the April 13 county canvassers board meeting \u2014 brings proof of identification to the election office.\n\nHowell warns voters that this is \u201cRoad Construction Season\u201d and many projects are underway in Topeka and Shawnee County. Those projects may affect usual routes to polling places. Access is available to all Shawnee County voting places, but alternate routes/access may be necessary for some locations. For a listing of projects, visit www.snco.us/election.\n\nThis election includes races for school board members for all school districts, city governing body positions for Topeka, Auburn, Rossville, Silver Lake and Willard, certain drainage directors and a city of Topeka ballot question regarding the duties of the mayor.\n\nAnyone with questions concerning their voter registration status may call the election office at (785) 251-5900, Howell said.
