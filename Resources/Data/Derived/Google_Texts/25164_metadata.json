He understands how to separate what\u2019s really important from what\u2019s less important.\u201d\n\nObama also cited Biden\u2019s \u201cgreat people skills\u201d as highly useful should he decide to make a run for the Oval Office. Undoubtedly, Obama was referring to Biden\u2019s ability to comfortably embrace old women, take selfies with pop stars, snuggle up to bikers and \u2014 most recently \u2014 awkwardly speak a group of progressives.\n\n\u201cHe enjoys politics, and he\u2019s got important relationships up on the Hill that would serve him well,\u201d added the president.\n\nHowever, Obama did admit that both Biden and potential Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton must decide whether or not a presidential campaign would be the right thing at this \u201cphase in their lives.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that, for both Joe and for Hillary, they\u2019ve already accomplished an awful lot in their lives,\u201d he explained. \u201cThe question is, do they, at this phase in their lives, want to go through the pretty undignifying process of running all over again.\u201d\n\nOf course, The New Yorker reporter also interviewed Biden for the piece and described the vice president as \u201cexcited\u201d during their conversation about 2016, especially when it came to discussing issues our country faces and income inequality in particular.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not talking enough about income inequality,\u201d Biden asserted. \u201cWe\u2019re not talking enough about how in God\u2019s name could you talk about a $5.7-trillion additional tax cut, for Christ\u2019s sake. How can we continue to say a twenty-per-cent tax on carried interest is fair? Why the hell aren\u2019t we talking about earned income versus unearned income?\u201d\n\nThough Biden didn\u2019t give anything away about his potential run, saying that he could \u201cdie a happy man not being president,\u201d it seems he has Obama\u2019s endorsement. Unfortunately for Biden, the majority of Americans do not approve of President Obama and likely won\u2019t listen to any endorsement that he makes.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "In a piece entitled \"The Biden Agenda\" for next week's addition of The New Yorker, writer Evan Osnos quotes President Obama as predicting that Vice President Joe Biden would make a \"superb president.\"", "title": "Obama says Biden would make a 'superb president' in New Yorker...", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://redalertpolitics.com/files/2014/03/Joe-Biden-600x400.jpg", "height": 400}, "url": "http://redalertpolitics.com/2014/07/21/obama-says-biden-make-superb-president-new-yorker-interview/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "app_id": 529886110401651}, "msvalidate.01": "0F003B4674EABE0F24651B476B61A43C", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RedAlertPolitics", "tag": "obama-new-yorker-interview", "published_time": "2014-07-21T11:01:27+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-21T13:54:50+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb0be\"", "article_summary": "Osnos interviewed President Obama before writing the article and questioned the president on Biden\u2019s viability as a presidential candidate in the next election.\nIn a piece entitled \u201cThe Biden Agenda\u201d for next week\u2019s edition of The New Yorker, writer Evan Osnos quotes President Obama as predicting that Vice President Joe Biden would make a \u201csuperb president.\u201dThe article spotlights the vice president and his accomplishments, particularly zeroing in on the possibility of Biden making a run for the presidency in 2016.\nUnfortunately for Biden, the majority of Americans do not approve of President Obama and likely won\u2019t listen to any endorsement that he makes.\n\u201cI think Joe would be a superb President,\u201d replied Obama.\n\u201cHe enjoys politics, and he\u2019s got important relationships up on the Hill that would serve him well,\u201d added the president."}
