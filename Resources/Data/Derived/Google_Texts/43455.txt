ATLANTA | A major insurer says Georgia residents file the most claims for lightning strikes in the country.

State Farm officials told WSB-TV that it paid more than $16 million for lightning-related claims in 2014.

The owner of Labeled Lightning Protection Inc., Reagan Cortes, said fires caused by lightning can be prevented with a protection system.
