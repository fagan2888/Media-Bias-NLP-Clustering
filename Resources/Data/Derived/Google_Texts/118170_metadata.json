We walked past the entrance twice.\n\nWe sat down at a diner and went over the symptoms again. If he went in, uninsured, the costs would be out of sight. But his symptoms looked like a heart attack.\n\nIt was the terrifying choice faced by thousands, the kind of thing Obamacare is supposed to halt.\n\nIn the end, we didn\u2019t go in, and he is all right. As of January 1, after many hours of phone and computer hassles, he secured Medicaid coverage, newly expanded in New York as part of Obamacare.\n\nThen I spent the holidays at home in Florida, where friends in a similar financial state are still without coverage, and not just because signing up is a mind-numbing interrogation.\n\nThere are plenty of plans to choose from\u2014an Olympics of bronze, silver, and gold. Tantalizingly, the premiums are fully subsidized if you\u2019re low-income. But you can still be too poor to use Obamacare.\n\nThat\u2019s because even with premiums subsidized, the patient is still expected to pay deductibles between $3,500 and $6,250 before the insurance will pay for any care (and with the smaller deductibles come larger co-pays, up to 30 percent).\n\nAt Christmas dinner, a friend calculated she\u2019d have to pay a third of her annual income before the insurance company would pay for anything, even medicine.\n\nUnder Obama\u2019s original plan, she would have been eligible for Medicaid, but when the Supreme Court OK\u2019d Obamacare, it allowed states to opt out, which Florida and 24 other states have done\u2014even though 100 percent of the cost would be paid by the feds.\n\nObamacare funds states to offer Medicaid to anyone with income up to 133 percent of the poverty level\u2014$15,281 for an individual, $31,321 for a family of four. And guess which states are opting out? Basically the entire South, hitting African Americans hardest. (See here for news of protests in Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina, and a new study here on the financial impacts and expected death toll.)\n\nThe Medicaid expansion that the Supreme Court wrecked was in many ways the best part of Obamacare (though some states that did sign up are doing their best to privatize it). It would have covered millions of low-income workers previously excluded from the program, which until now mostly just helped the disabled and families with dependent children.\n\nBut you don\u2019t have to be hovering near the federal poverty level to be seriously wounded by the huge deductibles and co-pays in the Obamacare plans. Who benefits? The insurance companies will make a mint because they don\u2019t have to pay until you\u2019ve bled for a while.\n\nThis windfall hasn\u2019t stopped them from whining. First, they dumped millions of people rather than make their insurance come up to the standards required under Obamacare. Now they\u2019re moaning that too few young, healthy (read: cheap to insure) people have signed up.\n\nFine. If they can\u2019t hack it, let\u2019s just extend Medicare (currently for those over 65) to everyone. It would be cheaper, and it works pretty well without any private insurers involved.\n\nThat made me think of other Florida friends, Colin and Kristina, who emigrated to Canada a few years ago with their two daughters. I asked Colin how it was to sign up for health care there.\n\n\u201cLike getting a drivers license, but without the test,\u201d he said. The family went to an office with their proof of residency, got their photos taken, and their health cards came in the mail. No deductibles, everyone\u2019s covered.\n\n\u201cGood care, too,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cSlingshot\u201d is a column where Labor Notes staffers take aim at issues of the day.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "https://labornotes.org/sites/dc.lndev.opa.labornotes.org/files/logo_with_slogan.png"}, "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3661\"", "article_summary": "But you can still be too poor to use Obamacare.\nIt was the terrifying choice faced by thousands, the kind of thing Obamacare is supposed to halt.\nFirst, they dumped millions of people rather than make their insurance come up to the standards required under Obamacare.\nAs of January 1, after many hours of phone and computer hassles, he secured Medicaid coverage, newly expanded in New York as part of Obamacare.\nObamacare funds states to offer Medicaid to anyone with income up to 133 percent of the poverty level\u2014$15,281 for an individual, $31,321 for a family of four."}
