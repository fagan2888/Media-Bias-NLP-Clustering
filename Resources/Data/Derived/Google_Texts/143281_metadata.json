America should defund the organization completely.\n\n\u201cI am urging you to confront this evil in our nation by praying and preaching with an unbridled passion until funding for Planned Parenthood ends and this barbaric practice is purged from the land,\u201d Cruz said.\n\n\u201cThe battle we face is not political. It is spiritual. To enter this arena in a prayer-less condition invites failure.\u201d\n\nCruz likes to play on emotion as well as dramatics. He hones in on the opportunity that religious institutions can do his PR work for him. It becomes less of an issue of women\u2019s health as it becomes a race for the public\u2019s approval, after falsified videos were leaked a few months ago.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg Politics, this advancement in Cruz\u2019s campaign against the organization has many states following suit such as Louisiana, which plans to cut its Medicaid assistance to Planned Parenthood on Monday.\n\nLast Wednesday, congressional meetings were held focusing their attention on abortion and the issue of the circulated videos. Planned Parenthood representatives were not invited to attend and defend themselves.\n\nWhat a shocker.\n\nAlyssa Quesada, 25, is a single mother who works as a medical assistant for home health with Planned Parenthood.\n\n\u201c(The) first time I came to their clinic, I was quickly seen and given information pertaining to safe sex and guidance on the different methods of birth control that were offered. They were kind and informative,\u201d Quesada said.\n\n\u201cTed Cruz\u2019s cult followers are the first in line to judge about what is and isn\u2019t right and how this organization \u2018defies God\u2019 But they will also be the quickest to turn their backs on the young women of America who really need help and government assistance,\u201d she said.\n\nIt has become a back-breaking struggle to find other outlets for affordable women\u2019s healthcare with the new restricted laws. Planned Parenthood offers thousands of women birth control for as low as $9 without insurance.\n\nThe government of Texas needs to look past conservative virtues and give women that are seeking support a better alternative before they revoke what we do have.\n\nCruz, we as women, take note that you are trying to compensate in your deficiency of leadership skills with religious authoritarianism. But please refrain from abusing your power and limiting ours.\n\nCORRECTION: The word \u2018delusion\u2019 was originally misspelled in the SEO headline.\n\nOpinion columnist Phylicia Sneed is an English senior and may be reached at [email protected]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ted Cruz fights against Planned Parenthood and women's healthcare in an attempt to win over the support of the public and religious leaders", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Cougar", "description": "Ted Cruz fights against Planned Parenthood and women's healthcare in an attempt to win over the support of the public and religious leaders", "title": "Ted Cruz delusion with women's healthcare", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://thedailycougar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/ted-cruz.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-09-15T10:35:57+00:00", "url": "http://thedailycougar.com/2015/09/14/cruz-puts-religious-agenda-over-womens-liberties/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Cougar", "description": "Ted Cruz fights against Planned Parenthood and women's healthcare in an attempt to win over the support of the public and religious leaders", "title": "Ted Cruz delusion with women's healthcare", "image": {"src": "http://thedailycougar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/ted-cruz.jpg"}, "creator": "@thedailycougar", "site": "@thedailycougar", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 37502686}, "article": {"publisher": "http://facebook.com/thedailycougar", "section": "Opinion", "tag": "war on women", "published_time": "2015-09-14T05:00:41+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-15T10:35:57+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd6093\"", "article_summary": "Cruz puts religious agenda over women\u2019s libertiesApparently, there\u2019s no room in the Texas budget for basic women\u2019s healthcare.\nTed Cruz assumes his religious convictions are \u201cAmerican values,\u201d but why should his opinion be the only one that matters?\nAlyssa Quesada, 25, is a single mother who works as a medical assistant for home health with Planned Parenthood.\nLast month he even emailed and invited over 100,000 pastors for an \u201call-out assault on Planned Parenthood.\u201d His intention was loud and clear.\nPlanned Parenthood representatives were not invited to attend and defend themselves."}
