Unlike many high school teams, Ashley Hall practices doubles routinely, preparing for the moment that could decide a state championship.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t in the cards. Hammond School\u2019s superior experience and talent at the top of its lineup won this time, much like a year ago when Porter-Gaud came out ahead in the battle of doubles to turn back the Panthers in the state final.\n\nIt was 5-4 again, with Ashley Hall\u2019s opponent again winning two of the three doubles.\n\nIt could have been senior day in that all five of Hammond\u2019s wins were produced solely by seniors. Also, Ashley Hall\u2019s two senior starters, Gyles Laney and McCrae Nistad, both collected victories in singles while Nistad also won at doubles.\n\n\u201cYes, I would say that senior experience is an asset,\u201d Gastley admitted.\n\nThe Panthers were out-seniored this time. With four starters returning, next year may be a different story.\n\nSCHSL Playoffs\n\nThe SCHSL Class AAAA girls state playoffs will begin Wednesday with 2014 state runner-up Wando entertaining White Knoll. The Warriors are in the same quarter of the draw as unbeaten Lexington, the only team to defeat Wando this season.\n\nIf the two powerhouses meet again in the Lower State semifinals, the match would be played at Lexington this time. Wando knocked off another unbeaten Lexington team in last year\u2019s Lower State final.\n\nIn other first-round Class AAAA matches, Region 8-AAAA runner-up Summerville will play host to Conway, while Fort Dorchester will travel to West Florence.\n\nBishop England will open defense of its four straight Class AA state championships on Nov. 2.\n\nLocal notes\n\nAfter a two-year layoff, the Charleston Professional Tennis League is back for a second year in a row, and 13th overall as it heads into Friday\u2019s semifinals and finals. The site is still undetermined, due to a change of venue forced by court conditions.

Three local senior teams also won state titles: Elisabeth Pickelsimer\u2019s 65-plus 7.5 women, Pat Boyd\u2019s 55-plus 8.5 women and Jane Neckhardt\u2019s 40-plus 6.5 women.\n\nCharleston touring tennis professional Shelby Rogers (No. 147) is currently out of action with a back injury sustained in last weekend\u2019s qualifying in Luxembourg. \u201c(My) back is hurt so I am taking time to recover and heal,\u201d she said Saturday from Florida. The injury likely ended Rogers\u2019 hopes of climbing up the rankings high enough to earn a direct entry into January\u2019s Australian Open. Samantha Crawford (175) was a quarterfinalist at $50,000 Saguenay, Canada, last week, while Jessie Pegula (151) made the second round. Ellie Halbauer (421), another player with local connections, made the main draw in Saguenay.\n\nBrant Fenno gained a measure of revenge against Jacob Jahn in the recent USTA Regional in Northcross, Ga., with a straight-set victory in consolation play after both highly regarded local players had lost in the main draw boys 16 quarterfinals. Scotty Cameron and Mark Militzer both were boys 18 quarterfinalists.\n\nFort Dorchester\u2019s Mittie Asbury has been selected as the Region 8-AAAA coach of the year. The all-region team is made up of Summerville\u2019s Sullivan Long and Paige Reynolds, Fort Dorchester\u2019s Monai Mitchel and Taylor Rodgers, Ashley Ridge\u2019s Arianna Brim and Katelyn Schmedeke, Colleton County\u2019s Alicia Roberson and Anni Crook, and 8-AAAA champion Bluffton\u2019s Cooper Baxter, Rachel Riley and region player of year Natalie Bassett.\n\nReach James Beck at jamesbecktennis@gmail.com.
