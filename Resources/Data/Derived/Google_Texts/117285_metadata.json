Janet Nguyen in Orange County.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve earned our street cred. Now it\u2019s the point where we\u2019re seeking that official recognition from the party. We\u2019ve earned it,\" Moran said.\n\nConservatives are lining up to oppose the effort, arguing that it would weaken the Republican Party\u2019s values.\n\nKaren England, executive director of the Capitol Resource Institute, a Sacramento-based group that backs conservative social causes, told supporters in an email Saturday morning that the Log Cabin group should not be recognized because it focuses on \u201clifestyle preferences\u201d rather than growing the GOP.\n\n\u201cIf Log Cabin California is chartered, look for the California Republican Party platform to be watered down in terms of family values,\u201d England wrote.\n\nThe party\u2019s official platform says homosexuality is unacceptable.\n\n\u201cWe believe public policy and education should not be exploited to present or teach homosexuality as an acceptable \u2018alternative\u2019 lifestyle. We oppose same-sex partner benefits, child custody, and adoption,\u201d the platform says.\n\nHowever, the move comes amid a changing landscape for gay people and the party. Last year, GOP gubernatorial candidate Neel Kashkari marched in a gay pride parade, the first statewide Republican candidate to do so. Assemblyman Rocky Chavez (R-Oceanside), who is considering a run for U.S. Senate, supports same-sex marriage. The Log Cabin Luau, hosted by the California group, where attendees don rainbow-colored leis and sip mai tais, is among the best attended parties at state GOP conventions.\n\nThe Log Cabin Republicans\u2019 California chapter has submitted an application arguing that they meet the criteria to be a chartered organization of the party -- 10 chapters in 10 counties, each with at least 10 members who are registered Republicans, and at least 200 members statewide.\n\nThe Volunteer Organization Committee will consider the request at a meeting Saturday evening. If they approve it, the matter will go to the convention floor for a vote Sunday morning.\n\nOther officially recognized charter organizations include the California Federation of Republican Women and the California College Republicans.\n\nFollow @LATSeema for political news.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Gay group seeks official recognition from California Republican Party", "date": "2015-02-28", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "A gay GOP group is seeking official recognition by the California Republican Party at its biannual gathering in Sacramento this weekend, potentially setting the stage for a divisive floor fight on Sunday.", "title": "Gay group seeks official recognition from California Republican Party", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/local/political/la-me-pc-gay-gop-group-seeks-official-recognition-from-california-republican-party-20150228-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-54f253ed/turbine/la-me-pc-gay-gop-group-seeks-official-recognition-from-california-republican-party-20150228", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp16.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "california republican party, log cabin republicans", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373238146, app-argument=http://www.latimes.com/deeplinkid/82942091", "googlebot-news": "index", "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "news_keywords": "california republican party, log cabin republicans", "y_key": "cee2fe4077f8d050", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "Description": "A gay GOP group is seeking official recognition by the California Republican Party at its biannual gathering in Sacramento this weekend, potentially setting the stage for a divisive floor fight on Sunday.
