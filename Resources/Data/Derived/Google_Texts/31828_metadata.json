The alumni also posted their letter online, where it has collected hundreds of additional signatures.\n\n\u201cWe are deeply concerned that shortcomings that we identified in our university\u2019s approach to sexual violence when we were students apparently still persist,\u201d the alumni write in their letter.\n\nEarlier this month, the U.S. Department of Education launched a federal investigation into the university following allegations that administrators have mishandled rape cases. The school\u2019s student newspaper has done extensive reporting into the issue of sexual assault on the University of Chicago\u2019s campus, and found that many students believe there are shortcomings in this area \u2014 partly because the school doesn\u2019t have a centralized database to track rape reports. That reporting helped convince the government to investigate further.\n\nBack in 1996 and 1997, the open letter\u2019s signatories helped form the student groups Action for a Student Assault Policy (ASAP) and the Coalition Against Sexual Violence (CASV). They explain that they decided to form those groups \u201cin reaction to frustration with what we believed were the administration\u2019s mishandled and inadequate responses to both sexual assaults and assaults against minority students.\u201d Then, those groups went on to identify some of the very same issues \u2014 like the lack of a centralized office with adequate resources to coordinate sexual assault response and prevention \u2014 that the recent student newspaper investigation uncovered.\n\n\u201cOur organization, Action for a Student Assault Policy, was named in part to underscore the urgency behind reform; we believed changes needed to be made ASAP. It is painful and ironic to learn that, two decades later, these pervasive problems have not been adequately addressed,\u201d the alumni note. \u201cFormer students are watching and waiting for the University of Chicago to do the right thing.\u201d\n\nThe University of Chicago isn\u2019t the only institution in the city receiving outside pressure to reform its sexual assault policy. Earlier this week, faculty, alumni, and staff at Northwestern University also launched a petition demanding reform in this area, after Northwestern failed to fire a professor who was found guilty of sexual harassment. The student who was the subject of that harassment sued the university last week for failing to do anything to punish her assailant.\n\nIn fact, college campuses across the country have been accused of failing to protect victims in an attempt to sweep rape under the rug. Despite the fact that there are some extremely simple policies that administrations could enact to help connect survivors of sexual assault with the resources they need, the majority of them haven\u2019t taken those steps. These failures are becoming increasingly evident to the general public. Just 12 percent of Americans across the country think that colleges are doing a good job handling rape.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "\u201cFormer students are watching and waiting for the University of Chicago to do the right thing.\u201d", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "\u201cFormer students are watching and waiting for the University of Chicago to do the right thing.\u201d", "title": "University Of Chicago Alumni Demand Sexual Assault Reform, Saying Nothing Has Changed In Decades", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/02/26/3336341/university-chicago-alumni-rape/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/rape-culture1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\u201cFormer students are watching and waiting for the University of Chicago to do the right thing.\u201d", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/rape-culture1-321x214.jpg", "title": "University Of Chicago Alumni Demand Sexual Assault Reform, Saying Nothing Has Changed In Decades", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/rape-culture1.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/rape-culture1.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-26T16:35:04+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Health University Of Chicago Alumni Demand Sexual Assault Reform, Saying Nothing Has Changed In Decades CREDIT: Christine Baker/The Patriot-NewsA group of University of Chicago alums have penned an open letter to their alma mater, demanding to know why the school\u2019s sexual assault policies haven\u2019t changed despite the fact that student activists first identified areas for improvement back in the 1990s.\n\u201cFormer students are watching and waiting for the University of Chicago to do the right thing.\u201dThe University of Chicago isn\u2019t the only institution in the city receiving outside pressure to reform its sexual assault policy.\n\u201cOur organization, Action for a Student Assault Policy, was named in part to underscore the urgency behind reform; we believed changes needed to be made ASAP.\nBack in 1996 and 1997, the open letter\u2019s signatories helped form the student groups Action for a Student Assault Policy (ASAP) and the Coalition Against Sexual Violence (CASV).\nDespite the fact that there are some extremely simple policies that administrations could enact to help connect survivors of sexual assault with the resources they need, the majority of them haven\u2019t taken those steps."}
