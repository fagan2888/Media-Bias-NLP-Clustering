You can cite many reasons for the issue \u2013 including the decision by state officials not to expand Medicaid \u2013 but the bottom line is this: an estimated 12 percent of Alabamians, about 588,000 people, don't have medical insurance coverage.\n\nThe New York Times recently mapped locations based on the percentage of people without health insurance. Using that data, here are the 15 Alabama counties where the most people live without health insurance.\n\n20 percent uninsured\n\nSumter County \u2013 20 percent\n\nPerry County \u2013 20 percent\n\n19 percent uninsured\n\nMacon County \u2013 19 percent\n\nEscambia County \u2013 19 percent\n\nDallas County \u2013 19 percent\n\n18 percent uninsured\n\nWilcox County \u2013 18 percent\n\nBullock County \u2013 18 percent\n\nBarbour County \u2013 18 percent\n\n17 percent uninsured\n\nDeKalb County \u2013 17 percent\n\nPickens County \u2013 17 percent\n\nChoctaw County-17 percent\n\nWashington County \u2013 17 percent\n\nConecuh County \u2013 17 percent\n\nMonroe County \u2013 17 percent\n\nButler County \u2013 17 percent\n\nInterestingly enough, two of the counties \u2013 Escambia and Washington \u2013 have seen their numbers of uninsured grow since Obamacare was implemented in 2013. Escambia County's uninsured rate grew 2 percent while Washington County's grew 1 percent in the last two years.\n\nUninsured rates in the other counties either remained flat or improved slightly \u2013 none by greater than 2 percent \u2013 from 2013.\n\nThe lowest uninsured rate in the state was Shelby County, where 7 percent aren't covered. That's a decline from 10 percent in 2013.\n\nWelcome to Tuesday's Wake Up Call. Let's get moving:\n\n\n\nTrick or treat medications?\n\nPolice in Quebec are investigating how a woman's medication for bipolar disorder ended up being handed out to trick-or-treaters at a grocery store on Halloween.\n\nPolice said a customer dropped medication from her purse by mistake and another customer took it to the service desk at Metro grocery store. It was placed next to the candy and handed out to children by mistake.\n\nIt's not believe anyone swallowed the pills \u2013 which can cause suicidal thoughts, nausea and tremors \u2013 but at least one girl chewed them up before spitting them out.\n\nGoing to see Star Wars? Leave your costume at home\n\nStar Wars' The Force Awakens comes out Dec. 18 but some theaters are already warning people to leave their costumes at home.\n\nCinemark Theater in Los Angeles is selling tickets but advising people that \"no face coverings, face paint, or simulated weapons \u2014 including light sabers \u2014 will be allowed in the buildings.\"\n\nThe reason behind the ban is likely safety concerns, after the deadly 2012 shootings during a showing of \"The Dark Knight Rises\" and July's slaying of two at a Louisiana theater during a screening of \"Trainwreck.:\n\nHastert portrait removed from House hallway\n\nThe portrait of former Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert has been removed from the House hallway where it had hung for years following his guilty plea in connection to fraud charges.\n\nThe payments from Hastert are tied to a $3.5 million payment the Illinois Republican was paying to a former student in connection to sexual abuse allegations.\n\nNew Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisc., had Hastert's portrait replaced with one of Frederick H. Gillett of Massachusetts, Speaker from 1919 to 1925.\n\nBacon may soon get a warning label in California\n\nBacon is really having a bad fall.\n\nFirst, the World Health Organization came out with a report that bacon, along with other red and processed meats, cause cancer. Now, a California group wants to see bacon, sausage, hot dogs, ham, beef, veal and pork come with a warning label.\n\nThe Center for Biological Diversity said California's Prop 65 required the state to list all chemical and substances on WHO's International Agency for Research on Cancer as \"carcinogenic to humans.\" That means a label similar to the one now applied to tobacco products should be placed on meat products, the group said.\n\nThe California Attorney General's office has not responded to the idea.\n\nUntil tomorrow.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Dennis Hastert, health insurance, Alabama, Bacon, California, Washington County, Shelby County, Escambia County, insurance coverage, The New York Times, Sumter County, Macon County, Conecuh County, Barbour County, Perry County, Wilcox County, Bullock County, Pickens County, DeKalb County, Dallas County, Monroe County, Butler County, wake up call, news", "title": "15 Alabama counties where the most people live without health insurance", "og": {"site_name": "AL.com", "description": "Two years into the Affordable Care Act, there are still places in Alabama where a significant number of people don't have health insurance.", "title": "15 Alabama counties where the most people live without health insurance", "url": "http://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2015/11/16_alabama_counties_where_the.html", "image": "http://image.al.com/home/bama-media/width620/img/opinion/photo/14678321-standard.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Two years into the Affordable Care Act, there are still places in Alabama where a significant number of people don't have health insurance.", "creator": "@LeadaGore", "image": "http://image.al.com/home/bama-media/width620/img/opinion/photo/14678321-standard.jpg", "title": "15 Alabama counties where the most people live without health insurance", "site": "@aldotcom", "card": "summary"}, "article_date_updated": "Tuesday, November 03, 2015,  6:04 AM", "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "AL.com", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/leada.gore"}, "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Tuesday, November 03, 2015,  6:02 AM", "article_author": "Leada Gore | lgore@al.com", "Description": "Two years into the Affordable Care Act, there are still places in Alabama where a significant number of people don't have health insurance."}, "article_summary": "Using that data, here are the 15 Alabama counties where the most people live without health insurance.\n20 percent uninsuredSumter County \u2013 20 percentPerry County \u2013 20 percent19 percent uninsuredMacon County \u2013 19 percentEscambia County \u2013 19 percentDallas County \u2013 19 percent18 percent uninsuredWilcox County \u2013 18 percentBullock County \u2013 18 percentBarbour County \u2013 18 percent17 percent uninsuredDeKalb County \u2013 17 percentPickens County \u2013 17 percentChoctaw County-17 percentWashington County \u2013 17 percentConecuh County \u2013 17 percentMonroe County \u2013 17 percentButler County \u2013 17 percentInterestingly enough, two of the counties \u2013 Escambia and Washington \u2013 have seen their numbers of uninsured grow since Obamacare was implemented in 2013.\nTwo years into the Affordable Care Act, there are still places in Alabama where a significant number of people don't have health insurance.\nThe New York Times recently mapped locations based on the percentage of people without health insurance.\nUninsured rates in the other counties either remained flat or improved slightly \u2013 none by greater than 2 percent \u2013 from 2013."}
