Dr. Christine Ebert-Santos and Candy Elkind were selected for the 2015 Mountain Town Business Women\u2019s Awards.\n\nThe award\u2019s inaugural year brought in several applicants from across western Colorado, five of who will receive awards this spring.\n\nLindsay Stapay, director of the Northwest Colorado Small Business Development Centers, said this year\u2019s selection committee consisted of \u201cladies we thought had a role in economic development in the region.\u201d\n\nThe committee was given a rubric with four criteria: leadership, innovation, mentoring and sustainability and longevity.\n\n\u201cWhat was really interesting, in my opinion, is that we had so many amazing women show up for the health and wellness leadership award,\u201d she said. \u201cWe decided to break that one award into two: leadership and emerging leader.\u201d\n\nCARING FOR A COMMUNITY\n\nOne of the two nominees, Dr. Ebert-Santos, was recognized for her \u201cLegacy Health and Wellness Leadership\u201d after creating her own clinic more than 15 years ago. While the Ebert Family Clinic was originally formed to support pediatric care, later on, the practice took steps to expand to adult care.\n\n\u201cBeing a business woman was not my first goal as a doctor,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was very intimidating to me to open my own clinic.\u201d\n\nShe moved to Summit County 17 years ago. Prior to moving to the mountains, she had worked in Saipan with the National Health Services.\n\nAfter living there with her family for several years, she joined her parents and brother in Summit, focused on providing a different opportunity for her children in high school. There, she looked for work as a pediatrician, but none of the local clinics needed one at the time.\n\n\u201cDr. Jim Bachman took me under his wing and said we really do need a pediatrician here,\u201d Ebert-Santos said.\n\nWith the support of her family and the community, on Feb. 1, 2000, she opened her own clinic.\n\n\u201cI still have several patients I took care of that day who are still in my practice,\u201d she said.\n\nStarting off a new business was not easy. She said her first manager, Dana Chambers, helped put everything in place.\n\n\u201cI started my business with a lot of help,\u201d she said. \u201cMy mom worked in my office, at the front desk, in the beginning.\u201d\n\nWith two practices in both Eagle and Summit Counties, Ebert-Santos would travel with an RN to attend house calls across the mountains to build up their reputation.\n\n\u201cI used to do a lot of house calls, everywhere from the trailer parks in Dotsero to the mansions of Beaver Creek,\u201d she reflected. \u201cWe would pack up our vaccines and our scales and our house call kit and do house calls all over Eagle and Summit County.\u201d\n\nWhile she has consolidated her practice to a Summit County office and no longer conducts house calls, she still takes steps to establish good communication with her patients.\n\n\u201cI tell patients, \u2018Call me. I don\u2019t want you to go to the ER if I can take care of it,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nLEARNING AND GROWING\n\nAbout three years ago, she began to take steps to expand into adult care. She has hired a psychologist, internist and nurse practitioner and hopes to grow more in the future.\n\nHer experiences are not limited to the clinic \u2014 she obtained her masters on healthcare leadership, wrote a thesis on expanding a rural practice under the Affordable Care Act and has conducted a substantial amount of scientific research.\n\nMost recently, she has researched the effects of altitude on growth in children and will soon present her research on high-altitude pulmonary edema to the American Thoracic Society.\n\nShe also spends part of her time trying to find ways to make health care more affordable for her patients. With her practice consisting of more than half Medicaid patients, she advocates for affordable health care \u2013 from both the perspectives of providers and patients.\n\n\u201cBefore the Affordable Care Act, we were always kind of on the brink financially because Medicaid doesn\u2019t pay very much,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause reimbursement is lower, many doctors don\u2019t want to see those patients. \u2026 I\u2019m very concerned about people\u2019s access to healthcare.\u201d\n\nDespite the challenges of paying for healthcare in the high country, she plans to continue the push to provide to as many as she can.\n\n\u201cAdding the business side to the medical side makes me feel like a much more well-rounded person,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel like I have the best job in the world.\u201d\n\nCREATIVE ENTREPRENEURS\n\nCandy Elkind, a Breckenridge resident who created her own fundraising business, was awarded \u201cCreative Business Leader\u201d for 2015. Having worked as a professional fundraiser for almost 20 years, she works to create solutions for Colorado Mountain College, the Summit Historical Society and several other local nonprofits.\n\n\u201cWith Candy, she has been able to network and really build collaboration,\u201d Stapay noted.\n\nElkind started her business in 2013, shortly after moving to Summit.\n\n\u201cThe job market was tight at the time,\u201d she said. \u201cI decided I have this level of expertise and experience; I\u2019m going to create my own consulting business and see what happens.\u201d\n\nAs with any new business, the first few months were difficult. She donated her time and efforts to build up a reputation before she got her first opportunity.\n\n\u201cA lot of organizations up here can\u2019t hire a full-time development person. That\u2019s where I fill that need,\u201d she added.\n\nShe chooses clients that match her core values and interests, focusing on nonprofits that work with education, health, fitness and even animal welfare. For example, one of her first clients was Animal Rescue of the Rockies, which brings in pets from high-kill shelters in other states. Not only did she work to help their nonprofit raise funds, but she also ended up adopting her own dog by the end. As the sole proprietor of the company, she has full control over the types of projects, and how many, she chooses to take on.\n\n\u201cI want it to be quality over quantity,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to be able to really get in there and do the work.\u201d\n\nGETTING THE GRANT\n\nWhen She takes on a client, she helps with grant writing, conversing with stakeholders and brainstorming initiatives to help convey a nonprofit\u2019s work to the community.\n\nFor Colorado Mountain College, Elkind works as regional development officer for Summit, Like and Chaffee counties. She helps with all fundraising efforts, but the biggest part of her work with the school is helping fund scholarships.\n\n\u201cCMC is an institution that provides the best opportunity at a very low rate for someone to get an associate\u2019s or bachelor\u2019s,\u201d she said. \u201cIt has quite an impact. I don\u2019t think many people know CMC is this little gem in our backyard.\u201d\n\nShe has also worked with the Breckenridge Outdoor Education Center and the Wounded Heroes Family Foundation as well as helped the Summit Foundation put on its annual rubber duck race. She is currently working with the Summit Historical Society to brainstorm new ways to connect people with the nonprofit\u2019s work \u2014 and the lesser-known pieces of Summit\u2019s history.\n\nSome concepts include a bike tour of historic sites, a tour of historic Lake Dillon, a partnership with local schools \u2014 ideas to get visitors out of a \u201cmuseum mindset.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe creative aspect comes through how to reach the unconnected population of that organization,\u201d she said. \u201cSure, it\u2019s important to go to the current donor base, but how do you reach unaffiliated individuals?\u201d\n\nOTHER NOMINEES\n\nTwo additional Summit women were recognized for their leadership in the local business community. Amy Kemp, co-founder of Elevate Coworking Space in Frisco, and Kristy Lee Gogolen, who creates mobile apps and website through her company, LadyBits Mobile Development, were both recognized as Distinguished Emerging Leader Honorees.\n\nFor the award, entrepreneurs were selected who fit a gap in the current marketplace, and who demonstrated an \u201cinnovative\u201d and \u201cfearless\u201d approach to business.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Two Summit County women will be recognized for their impact on the community through their businesses.
