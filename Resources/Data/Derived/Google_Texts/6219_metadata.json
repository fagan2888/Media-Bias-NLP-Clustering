Warren\n\nA new Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report predicts that nearly 40 percent of Americans \u2014 particularly people of color and women \u2014 will develop type 2 diabetes at some point in their lives. Researchers estimated the trends using medical information and death certificates of 600,000 U.S. adults between 1985 and 2011.\n\nThe findings, published in the Aug. 13 issue of The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology, come on the heels of another report that designated diabetes and obesity as two of the greatest public health challenges of the 21st century.\n\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t necessarily surprised that it increased, but we didn\u2019t expect it to increase this much,\u201d lead author of the study Edward Gregg told MedicineNet.com. \u201cForty percent is a humbling number.\u201d\n\nType 2 diabetes \u2014 the most common form of the chronic illness \u2014 remains the seventh leading cause of death in the United States. People with type 2 diabetes often experience high blood sugar levels, skin infections, fatigue, and increased urination. Treatment costs have exploded by more than 40 percent between 2007 and 2012 and now stand at more than $245 billion, according to the American Diabetes Association.\n\nExperts have long tied diabetes to obesity, lack of physical activity, and the consumption of high-fat, processed foods. People of color \u2014 particularly those with a family history of diabetes \u2014 have the greatest risk of developing the disease, especially if they live in suburbs, areas where amenities aren\u2019t in close proximity and people walk less.\n\nA shortage of endocrinologists \u2014 medical professionals who treat hormone-related conditions including diabetes, obesity, and thyroid disorders \u2014 has also played a part in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes in recent years. A June study in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism highlighted an endocrinologist shortage of 1,500 for adults and 100 for children. Wait times for non-emergency visits also average 37 days, according to a 2012 survey conducted by the Endocrine Society. Although researchers predicted that the treatment gap would close by 2016 for children, they said that treatment of adults would most likely remain an issue.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s rending people incapable of enjoying a good quality of life. It\u2019s raising health care costs at an alarming rate,\u201d Dr. Minisha Sood, an endocrinologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, told MedicineNet.com. \u201cAnd frankly, there aren\u2019t enough health care professionals to deal with what\u2019s coming down the pike. We\u2019re looking at clogging up a health care system that\u2019s already stretched to its limits.\u201d\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, adults with high blood pressure and pregnant women receive free diabetes screenings. Diabetic people can also develop behavioral and lifestyle changes with a counselor free of charge. Additionally, no lifetime dollar limit on coverage exists for treatment of diabetes. While that\u2019s good news, nearly five million Americans would not be able to use these services because more than 20 governors have not approved Medicaid expansion in their states. As a result, several hospitals and clinics stand to lose more than $423 billion in federal funding over the next decade, dimming the prospects of adequate care for people with type 2 diabetes and other chronic illnesses.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "The recent findings come on the heels of another report that designated diabetes and obesity as two of the greatest public health challenges of the 21st century.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "The recent findings come on the heels of another report that designated diabetes and obesity as two of the greatest public health challenges of the 21st century.", "title": "CDC Warns 40 Percent Of Americans Will Develop Diabetes: \u2018We Didn\u2019t Expect It To Increase This Much\u2019", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/08/14/3471288/forty-percent-americans-diabetes/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/AP583809157889.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The recent findings come on the heels of another report that designated diabetes and obesity as two of the greatest public health challenges of the 21st century.", "creator": "@SamPKCollins", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/AP583809157889-321x214.jpg", "title": "CDC Warns 40 Percent Of Americans Will Develop Diabetes: \u2018We Didn\u2019t Expect It To Increase This Much\u2019", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/AP583809157889.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/AP583809157889.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-14T13:05:34+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/sampkcollinswriter"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Health CDC Warns 40 Percent Of Americans Will Develop Diabetes: \u2018We Didn\u2019t Expect It To Increase This Much\u2019 CREDIT: AP Photo/Ted S.
