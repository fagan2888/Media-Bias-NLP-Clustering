Did you know over 400,000 Coloradans got insurance this past year thanks to Obamacare?

10 million Americans got covered thanks to Obamacare.

And guess what? In 2013, health care costs grew at their slowest rate since anyone started keeping track of such things (in 1960, for those of you wondering).

Obamacare is working. It's not perfect. There's more to do. But more people are covered and costs are slowing down. That's a decent start to fixing the health care crisis America has been facing for years.

Open enrollment is happening right now. It runs through February 15, 2015. So for people in need of health insurance or looking to shop around, now is the time to do it.

Getting more people informed and enrolled is the goal of the Got Insurance! campaign. Real stories of real people getting the care they need. Oh, and Congresswoman Diana DeGette and Uncle Sam lend a hand to help get the word out.

So take a second and head on over to the Got Insurance! website and learn what you need to know to get the coverage you need.

Think of it as the most important holiday shopping you can do this year.
