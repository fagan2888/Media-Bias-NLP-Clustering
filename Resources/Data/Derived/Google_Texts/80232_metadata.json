He hasn\u2019t backed down from the establishment and he won\u2019t.\u201d\n\nThe District 17 senator had endorsed Cruz early-on in the campaign.\n\n\u201cThe things I like about Sen. Cruz include his fight for smaller government, his defense of the Second Amendment, his pro-life stance, and the fact that he understands how Obamacare has hurt the economy in this country and how hard he has worked to undo it,\u201d Shelnutt said. \u201cHaving a record of actually standing for these things when others have compromised means something. His principles and has fortitude match those of the voters in Alabama. I anticipate a very good turnout from people in Trussville, Clay, Gardendale and Pinson.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.0.11", "og": {"site_name": "The Trussville Tribune", "description": "From Trussville Tribune staff reports TRUSSVILLE \u2013Sen.
