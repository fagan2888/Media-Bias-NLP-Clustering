News Editor/Multimedia Producer

Mason is on his second tour of duty with IBJ, having served as its real estate reporter from 1996 to 1999. Over 20-some years working for newspapers and magazines across the Midwest, he has covered most beats on the typical masthead, including business, sports, city government, arts, consumer issues and general assignment.

An alumnus of Broad Ripple High School, Mason continues a grand tradition of IBJ staffers educated in Indianapolis public schools. After graduating from Columbia University, he stumbled into print journalism, thanks to a Eugene C. Pulliam Fellowship at The Indianapolis Star. Among his favorite gigs were arts editor for the Daily Journal-World in Lawrence, Kan., and managing editor of Billiards Digest magazine, for which he spanned the globe covering world champions and poolroom hustlers. During his six-year tenure, BD was cited three times by the anthology “The Best American Sports Writing.”

Thanks to its unusually trusting head honchos, Mason returned to IBJ in 2009 to captain its nascent multimedia efforts. Over three years, he created 600-plus video segments for IBJ.com, and was recognized by the Society of American Business Editors and Writers (SABEW) and the Alliance of Area Business Publications (AABP). He has since added the mantle of news editor, which isn’t as lofty as it sounds.
