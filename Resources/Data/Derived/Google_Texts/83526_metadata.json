( The Telegraph , March 22, 2014).\n\nThe Coming out Party of Michelle Robinson Obama in China proves she\u2019s as big a hypocrite as her husband the president.\n\n\u201cFreedom of information, expression and belief\u201d has all but died a tragic death on her husband\u2019s watch. Barack Obama and his top flight lieutenants former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and former US Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice blamed the deaths of four Americans, including Ambassador Christopher Stevens in Benghazi on an obscure Internet video.\n\nHer husband uses the raw power of the IRS to blog Tea Party \u2018dissidents\u2019 whom he has openly called \u201cTea Baggers\u201d and continues with his mission to fundamentally transform America that rips the soul out of the country the world looks up to for leadership.\n\nIn pretending to espouse \u201cfreedom of information, expression and belief\u201d as \u201cuniversal rights\u201d, Michelle Obama, who is counting on Chinese students not knowing about what is going on in the U.S., couldn\u2019t be more wrong.\n\nChinese students top the class enjoying the reputation as the best students worldwide.\n\nMichelle Obama would have as much credibility with the Chinese students at Peking University as she did when she turned up at the Summer Palace wearing a shirt emblazoned with a picture of a horse, it being The Year of the Horse in China.\n\n\u201cSpeaking at Peking University on the second full day of a weeklong, bridge-building family tour of the country, Mrs Obama said: \u201cIt is so important for information and ideas to flow freely over the internet and through the media.\u201d (The Telegraph)\n\n\u201cMrs Obama, who arrived in China on Thursday evening, avoided directly criticising Beijing\u2019s draconian control of the internet, media and religion.\n\n\u201cSocial media sites including Facebook, YouTube and Twitter are blocked in China and Xi Jinping, the president, has been waging a fierce war on dissent since coming to power in November 2012.\u201d\n\nJust this month Barack Obama has forfeited US control of the Internet, handing it over to the \u201cinternational community\u201d which is headed by China and Russia.\n\nAccording to The Telegraph, China\u2019s heavily controlled state media made no mention of Mrs Obama\u2019s comments.\n\nYou can depend on them being the talk of the Internet back home.\n\nSome will report that while her mother did the \u201cbarking\u201d, Michelle did the lying.\n\nNot likely any of the students Obama addressed could afford the $8,350 per night American taxpayers paid for her stay in the Beijing Presidential Suite.\n\nInteresting how she would answer one student\u2019s question that \u201cBarack has dragged me kicking and screaming into things that I wanted no parts of.\u201d\n\nLike any other woman of her day Obama could have applied the universal: \u201cJust Say No\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, the Free World has just become a more dangerous place.
