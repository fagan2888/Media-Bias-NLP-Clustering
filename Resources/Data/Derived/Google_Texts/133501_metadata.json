Typically, high CEO salaries lead to more efficient management and better outcomes--but for insurance companies, this doesn't appear to be the case, reported the International Business Times. Analysts have blamed high CEO paychecks--as well as those for other managerial positions throughout the industry--for soaring healthcare costs, noted the IBT.\n\nThe healthcare industry has taken many recent steps to make healthcare more affordable, including the introduction of value-based care and the ongoing effort to reduce hospital readmissions. But CEO pay packages may affect inflated costs of healthcare.\n\n\"If executives are loaded up with stock options and other types of equity-based pay, they have a personal incentive to boost share prices by whatever means necessary,\" Sarah Anderson, global economy project director at the Institute for Policy Studies, told the IBT.\n\nFor the most part, an insurer CEO's earned salary is a small portion of his or her actual take home pay. Last year, Aetna's Mark Bertolini's base salary was $996,169, but he ended up receiving more than $36 million in total compensation, primarily from stocks and options. UnitedHealth Group's Stephen Hemsley took home more than $66 million in salary, stock options and other forms of compensation last year. That number was down from his total pay five years ago of $102 million, noted the IBT.\n\nWhen it comes to the industry as a whole, payer CEOs bring home the most bacon, averaging $584,000 a year, IBT said. Hospital CEOs are next on the list, earning an average of $386,000, while hospital administrators earn $267,000. Hospital physicians earn an average of $306,000 despite being the most highly trained professionals in the healthcare industry, FierceHealthcare previously reported. As with insurer CEOs, top hospital executives earn most of their income from non-salary compensation.\n\nHigh CEO salaries are often a subject of debate. Many large insurers benchmark against other insurers to determine appropriate compensation levels, but this is problematic if a CEO's pay increases without taking overall company performance into account. It has been suggested that a CEO's pay should depend upon how well he or she does the job, not how well a CEO at another company is compensated, FierceHealthPayer previously reported.\n\nFor more:\n\n- here's the AP data\n\n- check out the International Business Times piece\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nTop health insurance CEO pay exceeds $10 million in 2014\n\nIt may be time to revamp how insurers pay their CEOs\n\nAverage pay for insurer CEOs jumped to $14M\n\nHospital CEOs--not doctors--among medicine's top earners", "article_metadata": {"description": "The healthcare industry had the highest level of median pay for CEOs last year--$13.6 million--beating out other top industries such as basic materials, consumer goods and financial.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthPayer", "description": "The healthcare industry had the highest level of median pay for CEOs last year--$13.6 million--beating out other top industries such as basic materials, consumer goods and financial.", "title": "How healthcare CEO salaries hurt consumers", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthpayer.com/story/how-healthcare-ceo-salaries-hurt-consumers/2015-05-27", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthpayer.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "healthpayer", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "keywords": "CEO Salaries,Healthcare Costs,Healthcare Industry,Operations & Business Management,rising healthcare costs", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Operations & Business Management"}, "article_summary": "The healthcare industry has taken many recent steps to make healthcare more affordable, including the introduction of value-based care and the ongoing effort to reduce hospital readmissions.\nBut CEO pay packages may affect inflated costs of healthcare.\nHospital CEOs are next on the list, earning an average of $386,000, while hospital administrators earn $267,000.\nHospital physicians earn an average of $306,000 despite being the most highly trained professionals in the healthcare industry, FierceHealthcare previously reported.\nAnalysts have blamed high CEO paychecks--as well as those for other managerial positions throughout the industry--for soaring healthcare costs, noted the IBT."}
