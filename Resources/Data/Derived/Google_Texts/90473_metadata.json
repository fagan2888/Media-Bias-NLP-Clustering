Jeb Bush said he is nearing a decision whether to run for president in 2016.\n\n\"I'm thinking about running for president and will make up my mind in short order,\" Bush said. \"I do not know the exact timeline, (but) it will be the same decision making process I've always had.\"\n\nBush laid out his blueprint that could serve as his 2016 campaign platform.\n\nBush said his priorities include an \"all-in\" energy policy that expands the use of the country's natural resources, a reduction in business regulations, a simpler tax code, an \"economically driven\" overhaul of the immigration system and a transformation of the nation's education system, the Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nHis education platform would better serve the needs of individual children and break up \"government-run monopolies\" of local school districts, he explained.\n\nHe also spoke of his support for higher academic standards and for testing to see if students are meeting them.\n\n2016 Election Headquarters The latest headlines on the 2016 elections from the biggest name in politics.
