Johnson\n\nEven after spending six years in Washington D.C., Sen. Ron Johnson says he still feels like a political outsider.\n\n\u201cI come from the private sector. I bring that perspective that business is hard, and the federal government makes it that much more difficult for businesses to expand to create jobs that are higher paying and more secure versus Senator Feingold whose a career politician. Most recently, a California professor,\u201d said Sen. Johnson.\n\nJohnson says if elected to a second term, there\u2019s one word, to describe his focus, and that\u2019s \u201csecurity.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just national security, it\u2019s income security, job security, health care security. Let\u2019s face it, the pace and protection of the Affordable Care Act did not live up to it\u2019s name,\u201d said Sen. Johnson.\n\nA March 30 Marquette University Law School Poll shows Johnson was trailing Feingold 42% to 47%, but Johnson says he\u2019s not that worried.\n\n\u201cFrom my standpoint, our own internal polls have been a pretty dead even race. I think Senator Feingold acknowledges that as well. The public polls I think are not accurate. This is going to be a close hard fought race. I\u2019m going to concentrate on doing my job. I\u2019m going to concentrate on telling Wisconsinites what we need to do to put more money in their pay check and here\u2019s a hint, it\u2019s not growing government as Senator Feingold would want to do,\u201d said Sen. Johnson.\n\nJohnson also says he won\u2019t shy away from sharing a stage with Donald Trump, should he campaign this fall in Wisconsin.\n\nAction 2 News reached out to Feingold\u2019s campaign and here\u2019s what spokesperson Michael Tyler told us:\n\n\u201cWisconsin voters have had enough of insider Republicans putting corporate special interests ahead of middle class and working families. Sen. Johnson refuses to listen to the people of Wisconsin and he doesn\u2019t fight for them. No amount of money and rubber stamped talking points from insiders like Mitch McConnell, Scott Walker or the Koch brothers is going to change that fact. The people of Wisconsin want someone in the Senate who will listen to them and put their needs first, and that is clearly Russ Feingold and not Sen. Johnson.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "[anvplayer video=\"960734\"] One of the biggest races in November, at least in Wisconsin, is for U.S. Senate.
