Bush, and helped shape the administration\u2019s national health care policy in the early 1990\u2019s. The bill that Sullivan drafted for President Bush included some familiar-sounding provisions: insurance exchanges, subsidies for low-income individuals, and an individual mandate.\n\nWhen asked about President Obama\u2019s signature piece of legislation, Sullivan has made it clear that he supports the Affordable Care Act, even after its shaky rollout last fall.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m for the Affordable Care Act,\u201d he told the Anniston Star in November, after enrollment in the exchanges had already begun. \u201cIt\u2019s an imperfect build and has a number of things that need to be addressed, but rather than working to try to dismantle it, we should work to improve it.\u201d\n\nHe also didn\u2019t mince words about the Republican Party and their efforts to repeal the law, pointing out the support that his own similar plan received from many of the same Republicans now fighting to undo the law. \u201cThe plan had the similar concept of the health insurance exchange, but now the Republican Party is attacking the same concept,\u201d he told the Star. \u201cI\u2019m not for that kind of political one-upmanship.\u201d\n\nThat the RNC has branded a champion of Obamacare as one of their \u201cRepublican Trailblazers\u201d speaks less to a change of heart about Obamacare \u2014 Republicans have attempted to repeal the law more than 40 times \u2014 and more about the party\u2019s difficulty finding leaders of color who truly align with the party\u2019s agenda. In recent years, conservatives have also speciously sought to co-opt such black leaders as Martin Luther King Jr., Rosa Parks and Frederick Douglass.\n\nThe other two black leaders the RNC cites in their advertisements are Judge Sara J. Harper, a former president of the Cleveland NAACP, and William \u201cBill\u201d Brooks, a former Chairman of the GM Foundation who has donated to both Republicans and Democrats but gave the maximum campaign contribution to then-candidate Barack Obama in 2008.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "A former HHS Secretary under President George H.W Bush says he's \"for the Affordable Care Act.\"", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "A former HHS Secretary under President George H.W Bush says he's \"for the Affordable Care Act.\"", "title": "RNC Names Obamacare Supporter A \u2018Republican Trailblazer\u2019", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/02/04/3244131/republican-trailblazer-obamacare/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/louis_sullivan-e1391528006195.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A former HHS Secretary under President George H.W Bush says he's \"for the Affordable Care Act.\"", "creator": "@AdamReports", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/louis_sullivan-e1391528006195-321x214.jpg", "title": "RNC Names Obamacare Supporter A \u2018Republican Trailblazer\u2019", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/louis_sullivan-e1391528006195.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/louis_sullivan-e1391528006195.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-04T10:56:27+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8597\"", "article_summary": "Bush, and helped shape the administration\u2019s national health care policy in the early 1990\u2019s.\nSullivan served as HHS Secretary under Republican President George H.W.\nThe bill that Sullivan drafted for President Bush included some familiar-sounding provisions: insurance exchanges, subsidies for low-income individuals, and an individual mandate.\n\u201cThe plan had the similar concept of the health insurance exchange, but now the Republican Party is attacking the same concept,\u201d he told the Star.\nIn recent years, conservatives have also speciously sought to co-opt such black leaders as Martin Luther King Jr., Rosa Parks and Frederick Douglass."}
