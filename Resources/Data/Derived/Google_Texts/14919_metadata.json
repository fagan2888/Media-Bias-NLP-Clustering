The company could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nOther car seats tested came from Chicco; Cybex; Dorel Juvenile Group, which makes Safety 1st; Evenflo, Harmony Juvenile; Orbit Baby and Peg Perego.\n\n\u201cThis study reminds us that the lack regulation of chemicals in vehicles and vehicle components, like children's car seats, has resulted in vehicle interiors having some of the highest levels of hazardous chemicals including flame retardants,\u201d Andy Igrejas, campaign director of the Safer Chemicals, Healthy Families coalition said in a news release. \u201cYet in the face of increased consumer vigilance and activism, industry has responded by trying to exempt itself from aspects of federal regulation on chemicals. \u201d\n\nLawmakers have been working to overhaul the Toxic Substance Control Act of 1976, which was created to give the Environmental Protection Agency the ability to regulate the nation\u2019s most dangerous chemicals, but it is widely viewed as unenforceable.\n\nOn Wednesday, the House Energy and Commerce Committee advanced a toxic chemical safety bill on a nearly unanimous vote to the House floor for a vote later this month.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Three-quarters of child car seats tested contained hazardous flame retardants.", "description": "Three-quarters of child car seats tested contained hazardous flame retardants.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Lydia Wheeler", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Three-quarters of child car seats tested contained hazardous flame retardants.", "title": "Study finds toxic chemicals in child car seats", "url": "http://thehill.com/regulation/244015-study-finds-toxic-chemicals-in-child-car-seats", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/babyseat06042014getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T03:39-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/regulation/244015-study-finds-toxic-chemicals-in-child-car-seats", "dcterms.date": "2015-06-04T11:05-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Lydia Wheeler", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Flame retardants, Regulation of chemicals, Environment, Matter, child car seats,,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-04T11:05:24-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/regulation/244015-study-finds-toxic-chemicals-in-child-car-seats", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Three-quarters of child car seats tested contained hazardous flame retardants.", "card": "summary", "title": "Study finds toxic chemicals in child car seats"}, "dcterms.title": "Study finds toxic chemicals in child car seats"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd89c0\"", "article_summary": "Of 377 child car seats tested, nearly three-quarters were found to contain toxic flame retardant chemicals, according to new research from the Ecology Center released Thursday.\nOther car seats tested came from Chicco; Cybex; Dorel Juvenile Group, which makes Safety 1st; Evenflo, Harmony Juvenile; Orbit Baby and Peg Perego.\nThe nonprofit environmental organization found that 73 percent of child car seats tested contained hazardous halogenated flame retardants and more than half contained non-halogenated organophosphate flame retardants, some of which are hazardous as well.\n\u201cBabies are the most vulnerable population in terms of exposure, since their bodily systems are still developing and they spend many hours in their car seats.\u201dThe study included car seats from Britax, Clek and Graco.\n\u201cMany children spend hours in a car every week, or even every day, potentially exposing them to harmful flame retardants, the Ecology Center said."}
