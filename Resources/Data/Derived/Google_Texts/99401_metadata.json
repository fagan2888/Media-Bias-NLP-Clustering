Moreover, they need to know that the whole community is watching.\n\nSo are potential candidates, the best of whom may be dissuaded to apply for the job if they feel their tenure will be rife with fights with his or her nine bosses.\n\nThe reputation of the board has taken a hit over the years, and it has been described as fractured, divided and dysfunctional.\n\nSocial media agitation by some members, continuing fights over charter schools and last year\u2019s failed superintendent search have contributed to that reputation.\n\nTo put it bluntly, the message board members need to hear is: Don\u2019t screw this up.\n\nThe good news is that the school board, through its chair Sharon Gentry and vice chair Anna Shepherd, sent a message via an MNPS news release on Friday that they want the search to succeed and want the public to be part of the process.\n\n\"... we once again ask the community to step up and help guide us to the right decision for the children of Nashville,\" Gentry said.\n\nThe public should take this opportunity to attend forums with the job candidates, submit questions to board members via MNPSDirector.org website or to The Tennessean, which will be broadcasting some of the events.\n\nMNPS has real problems that need urgent solutions. The Nashville Public Education Foundation found through its Project RESET research last year that Nashville schools were performing the most poorly of all school districts in Tennessee.\n\nCompounded on that are a 35 percent mobility rate, a poverty rate that exceeds 70 percent, and the frequent decision that many middle-class parents make to pull their kids from MNPS and move to surrounding counties because they believe they will get a better education in Williamson, Wilson or Sumner counties, for example.\n\nNashville Mayor Megan Barry has made a solid commitment to partner with the school board in helping with the superintendent search.\n\nHer office, the foundation and community groups led a 17-member task force that developed 10 attributes the new superintendent should possess.\n\nThe attributes include consensus building in the community, implementing change without being unnecessarily disruptive to educators, and experience working with diverse student populations.\n\nThe task force urged the board to cast a wide net, think \u201coutside the box\u201d and not make compensation an impediment. Perhaps the strongest statement: \u201cDo not compromise on candidate quality.\u201d\n\nIn their recommendations, task force members wrote: \u201cWe believe this search could not only yield a strong, innovative leader who can take our schools forward on an accelerated path, but also turn the page to a new chapter in Nashville\u2019s pursuit of a world-class public school system.\u201d\n\nThe task force also developed a community survey, which 5,000 people took, one-third of them educators, a clear indication of the great interest in the search and the process.\n\nOn Tuesday Jim Huge, the school director search recruiter, provided board members a list of protocols to follow to ensure fairness and equity in the process.\n\nThe protocols are perfectly reasonable, asking board members not to compromise the process by demanding promises or political commitments from director candidates.\n\nThat\u2019s especially necessary as five board seats are up for election in August, with four incumbents running for re-election: Gentry, Will Pinkston, Amy Frogge and Jill Speering. Elissa Kim has decided not to run again.\n\nIt will be very tempting to let politics get in the way of the search.\n\nHowever, members of the public, through the task force survey, have sent the message that they are not pleased with the present direction of the school system and that they are worried about losing more ground and talent.\n\nThat is why the task force has put so much emphasis on unity and cooperation between the school board and the community.\n\nThis is a great opportunity for the school board.\n\nWhile the timeline is tight \u2014 the process goes May 3-15 \u2014 board members have the opportunity to do something great by hiring the person who will become the best public schools director in America.\n\nThe children of Nashville deserve no less.\n\nOpinion Engagement Editor David Plazas wrote this editorial on behalf of The Tennessean Editorial Board.

Please do not use one factor as an eliminator, but rather if you have a concern, ask the candidate about it. While we are obviously thoroughly checking references as part of our due diligence, I urge you to review information about the candidates and where appropriate, to check other potential references as you see fit. If you find anything that concerns you, please ask me about it and I will follow up and bring my findings back to you. To ensure fairness, and prevent any misperceptions, I strongly advise that board members have no direct contact with candidates or prospective candidates outside the formal interview process until after the selection process is concluded. This is critically important both to protect the integrity of the public process but also to avoid any appearance of influence. This goes without saying but under no circumstances \u2014 formally or informally \u2014 should any candidate be asked to make explicit personnel or political commitments of any kind. A hiring decision must be made on skill and vision, not on political maneuvering or confidential commitments. This is usually the most interesting and enjoyable time in the search process \u2014 your opportunity to get to know each candidate, learn from them, and showcase your community and district. As you know, while we are looking at them, each candidate is looking at Metro Nashville to see if it is a fit for their skills. One area each candidate will consider is Board conduct \u2014 especially the ability to engage in civil discourse at Board meetings as well as individually in all interactions with each other and in public statements. I know you are each particularly cognizant of this but I cannot underscore enough that this continue.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://tnne.ws/1SCKo0j", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Board members need to accept the candidate recruiter's list of protocols to make the search fair and successful.", "og": {"site_name": "The Tennessean", "description": "Board members need to accept the candidate recruiter's list of protocols to make the search fair and successful.", "title": "Nashville school board, don't sabotage director search", "url": "http://www.tennessean.com/story/opinion/editorials/2016/04/24/nashville-school-board-dont-sabotage-director-search/83346712/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/tennessean.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Board members need to accept the candidate recruiter's list of protocols to make the search fair and successful.", "title": "Nashville school board, don't sabotage director search", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0120d6632cae19b0a39177efeece85ab87f6e670/c=0-103-1634-1737&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/04/21/Nashville/Nashville/635968493474184739-Director-Search.jpg", "creator": "@tennessean", "site": "@tennessean", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600028886", "fb": {"app_id": 121487414583460}, "viewport": "width=1070", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/davidplazas"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Geography/Nashville", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Geography/Nashville", "title": "Nashville school board, don't sabotage director search", "author": "David Plazas", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "opinion/editorials", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d34d59a4827ebb9d49534e879ebf62f2e6ca3b7e/c=127-0-1507-1840/local/-/media/2016/04/21/Nashville/Nashville/635968493474184739-Director-Search.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f9c663ee4c90825d2a195640f436a3071aabdae7/c=0-103-1634-1737/local/-/media/2016/04/21/Nashville/Nashville/635968493474184739-Director-Search.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/769c0bfd71d55614e20203e2ad5969943358bc7a/c=0-121-1634-1350/local/-/media/2016/04/21/Nashville/Nashville/635968493474184739-Director-Search.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3a7772c8a6594a8b3b36f1db76d2866c36b7a515/c=0-131-1634-1054&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2016/04/21/Nashville/Nashville/635968493474184739-Director-Search.jpg", "publishtime": "2016-05-04T10:19:30.327000-05:00", "shorthed": "Nashville school board, don't sabotage director search", "articleid": 83346712, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4fdbef097ff915ce93aa093d049dbb44494fc9fa/c=0-131-1634-1054/local/-/media/2016/04/21/Nashville/Nashville/635968493474184739-Director-Search.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e6a4fa0a5ba9bd09c75069151889fda37b9c0e64/c=302-0-1332-1840/local/-/media/2016/04/21/Nashville/Nashville/635968493474184739-Director-Search.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": "public education, Metro Nashville Public Schools, MNPS, Sharon Gentry, Will Pinkston, Elissa Kim, Amy Frogge, Jill Speering"}, "article_summary": "Nashville Mayor Megan Barry has made a solid commitment to partner with the school board in helping with the superintendent search.\nTo put it bluntly, the message board members need to hear is: Don\u2019t screw this up.\nOn Tuesday Jim Huge, the school director search recruiter, provided board members a list of protocols to follow to ensure fairness and equity in the process.\nThe 2015 search failed, but board members and community can unite to make it different this time.\nList of protocols for the school board from director search recruiter Jim HugeWhen evaluating candidates, look at the total package: demonstrated successes, experience, skills and personality."}
