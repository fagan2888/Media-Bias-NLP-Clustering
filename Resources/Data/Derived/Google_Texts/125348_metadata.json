America has turned the page,' Biden says. | John Shinkle/POLITICO Biden defends Obamacare\n\nVice President Joe Biden delivered a message Thursday to Republicans still bent on undoing Obamacare: America is ready to move on.\n\n\u201cAfter Republicans in the Congress have voted to repeal the law 40 times, they still haven\u2019t given up on their message. After a disastrous effort of shutting down the federal government, they didn\u2019t get the message,\u201d he said during a keynote speech at the annual conference of Families USA, a pro-Obamacare ally of the White House. \u201cWe will not go back. America has turned the page.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nIn a 45-minute speech, Biden also took aim at Republican governors who have declined to embrace the health law\u2019s Medicaid expansion.\n\n\u201cIf Republican governors and state legislatures in the states of Texas, Florida, North Carolina and others would act responsibly, we could cover more than 5 million people,\u201d he said.\n\nBiden added that it shouldn\u2019t be surprising that a recent study showed Medicaid recipients still rely on the emergency room \u2014 a finding critics of Obamacare have used to argue against expanding the program to more poor people.\n\n\u201cThe truth is, many of these people never knew a doctor other than the emergency room,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t even know how to manage the system that covers them.\u201d\n\nBiden noted his own battle with serious medical issues as the foundation of his belief that health care should be a right \u2014 not only for the physical benefits but for the relief of having insurance as a financial backstop.\n\n\u201cI was hospitalized for seven months with two cranial aneurysms \u2026 the one solace I had even though the bills I had exceeded half a million dollars, I had insurance,\u201d he said during his address to Families USA\u2019s Health Action Conference.\n\nHis speech followed remarks by Kathy Stokes, a communications consultant and breast cancer survivor who said her final treatment this month wouldn\u2019t have been covered by insurance if it weren\u2019t for Obamacare. Her previous coverage, a COBRA plan offered through her ex-husband\u2019s employer, expired at the end of 2013.\n\n\u201cMy cancer odyssey is nearly over, but without Obamacare, 2014 would\u2019ve been a disaster. No insurance company would\u2019ve taken me on,\u201d Stokes said.\n\nAuthors:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "He delivers a message to Republicans still bent on undoing Obamacare: America is ready to move on.", "title": "Biden defends Obamacare", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/01/joe-biden-obamacare-defense-102513.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/01/23/20140122js_joe_biden155.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Obamacare,Joe Biden", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "He delivers a message to Republicans still bent on undoing Obamacare: America is ready to move on.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd423d\"", "article_summary": "| John Shinkle/POLITICO Biden defends ObamacareVice President Joe Biden delivered a message Thursday to Republicans still bent on undoing Obamacare: America is ready to move on.\n\u201cMy cancer odyssey is nearly over, but without Obamacare, 2014 would\u2019ve been a disaster.\nAmerica has turned the page.\u201dStory Continued BelowIn a 45-minute speech, Biden also took aim at Republican governors who have declined to embrace the health law\u2019s Medicaid expansion.\nAmerica has turned the page,' Biden says.\nBiden added that it shouldn\u2019t be surprising that a recent study showed Medicaid recipients still rely on the emergency room \u2014 a finding critics of Obamacare have used to argue against expanding the program to more poor people."}
