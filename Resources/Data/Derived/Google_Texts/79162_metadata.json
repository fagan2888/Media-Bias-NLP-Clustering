At least 34,000 people had joined the protest's Facebook page. Two weeks ago, tens of thousands attended a teachers' rally in Budapest to protest education reforms that have included extreme centralization, increased administrative tasks for teachers and a lack of choice in textbooks.\n\n\"This action was a first warning,\" protest organizer Krisztina Puskas told The Associated Press. \"If the government does not react to our proposals, we will continue.\"\n\nPuskas said she had received confirmation from over 250 schools that many parents had kept their children at home.\n\nEven though even some said it was wrong to involve children in the protests, Puskas said her appeal was aimed at parents, whom she urged to talk with their children about the issues at their schools.\n\n\"Parents have to defend their children from the bad education system,\" Puskas said.\n\nEducation officials stressed Monday was a school day like any other and said parents had other venues, like school forums, to express their criticisms.\n\nOn Feb. 6, the Hungarian government dismissed the official in charge of public education and vowed to reduce centralization efforts. Prime Minister Viktor Orban, meanwhile, has tried to cast teachers' grievances as just a salary dispute, even though that has not been a key factor in the protests.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hungarian parents keep kids home to protest education system - AP News: BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) \u2014 Thousands of Hungarian parents kept their .05/27/2016 8:16:13AM EST.", "author": "AP News", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) \u2014 Thousands of Hungarian parents kept their children home from school on", "title": "AP News - Hungarian parents keep kids home to protest education system", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/politics-elections/2016/02/29/hungarian-parents-keep-kids-home-to-protest-education-system-n2126452", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/_townhall/resources/images/thog.png", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) \u2014 Thousands of Hungarian parents kept their children home from school on", "title": "AP News - Hungarian parents keep kids home to protest education system", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/politics-elections/2016/02/29/hungarian-parents-keep-kids-home-to-protest-education-system-n2126452", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/_townhall/resources/images/thog.png", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Hungarian parents keep kids home to protest education system, AP News, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) \u2014 Thousands of Hungarian parents kept their children home from school on Monday to protest the government's education policies.\n\"Parents have to defend their children from the bad education system,\" Puskas said.\nOn Feb. 6, the Hungarian government dismissed the official in charge of public education and vowed to reduce centralization efforts.\nEducation officials stressed Monday was a school day like any other and said parents had other venues, like school forums, to express their criticisms.\nPuskas said she had received confirmation from over 250 schools that many parents had kept their children at home."}
