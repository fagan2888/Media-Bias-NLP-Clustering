It\u2019s not true,\u201d Grayson said, according to sources in the room.\n\n\u201cIt is true, and I want you to lose,\u201d Reid fired back.\n\nGrayson\u2019s confrontational approach was derided by Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), the leader of the CPC.\n\n\u201cWhy are you doing that?\u201d Ellison asked, according to sources in the room. \u201cThis is so stupid.\u201d\n\nAnother source said other CPC members shared Ellison\u2019s sentiments.\n\n\u201cAll the members were appalled\u201d by Grayson\u2019s behavior, the source said. \u201cIt was embarrassing for him and embarrassing for us that he behaved that way.\u201d\n\nGrayson, a liberal firebrand, is embroiled in a primary battle against Rep. Patrick Murphy (D-Fla.) for the swing seat soon to be vacated by Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), who had vied for the White House before bowing out of the race in March. Reid has endorsed Murphy in the contest.\n\nReid\u2019s office issued a statement after the meeting confirming the confrontation, saying the Democratic leader \u201cwas honored\u201d to address the CPC but that Grayson \u201cdecided to be disruptive, to the embarrassment of his fellow colleagues.\u201d\n\n\u201cSenator Reid took the opportunity to express his low opinion of Congressman Grayson to his face and remind him that the reason Senator Reid has said that Grayson is under ethics investigation and appears to be running a Cayman Islands hedge fund from his Congressional office in order to line his own pockets is because these things are true, as established by seventy-four pages worth of evidence from the Congressional Ethics Committee,\u201d the statement said.\n\nGrayson \u2014 who has dismissed the ethics complaint as \u201cfrivolous\u201d and \u201cpolitically motivated\u201d \u2014 defended his conduct at the meeting, saying his motive was \u201cvery simple.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wanted to find out why Harry Reid lied about me a couple of months ago, when he smeared me. ... I wanted to try to get to the bottom of it,\u201d Grayson told reporters. \u201cWhat he said was profoundly untrue, and even allowing for the fact that I am the anti-establishment candidate.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2016/05/harry_reid_tells_bomb_thrower_alan_grayson_i_want_you_to_lose.html", "image": "http://www.americanthinker.com/assets/images/at-painter-og-image.png", "title": "Blog: Harry Reid tells bomb thrower Alan Grayson, 'I want you to lose'"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "It\u2019s not true,\u201d Grayson said, according to sources in the room.\n\u201cIt is true, and I want you to lose,\u201d Reid fired back.\nI wanted to try to get to the bottom of it,\u201d Grayson told reporters.\n\u201cWhat he said was profoundly untrue, and even allowing for the fact that I am the anti-establishment candidate.\nGrayson\u2019s confrontational approach was derided by Rep.
