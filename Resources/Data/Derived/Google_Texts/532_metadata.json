But some are getting stuck on Step 2 \u2013 that is, finding a doctor.\n\nAlready, nearly a fifth of Americans live in areas with too few primary care physicians, and the shortage will only get worse as more people become insured. So, in some places, nurses are taking on the job of keeping people healthy.\n\nIn Milwaukee, a young boy named Earron Davis hops up on the exam table and swings his legs back and forth as a nurse takes his temperature and blood pressure. It\u2019s the 10 year-old\u2019s first visit to this new primary care clinic. It\u2019s an area of Milwaukee with great healthcare needs, but few doctors. Physicians don\u2019t want to be here because most people are on Medicaid, and doctors don\u2019t make money off those patients. So Earron\u2019s mom, Jessica Peterson, is happy there\u2019s a new healthcare option so close to home.\n\n\"Cause there\u2019s so many kids in the neighborhood that I\u2019m sure has to go far out to see a doctor, so this is very, very, very convenient,\" Peterson says.\n\nBut the clinic hasn\u2019t brought in any new doctors. Instead, nurse practitioners run it. They can handle the majority of primary care, and prescribe drugs. The clinic will still lose money on its Medicaid patients. But nurse practitioners cost a lot less than doctors. It\u2019s a model that\u2019s spreading.\n\n\"There has been tremendous growth in the nurse-managed health clinics, especially prior to the Affordable Care Act implementation, but certainly also now,\" says Tine Hansen-Turton, CEO of the National Nursing Centers Consortium. She says there are now 500 nurse-led clinics around the country, and the number will expand as providers look for less pricey ways to provide health care.\n\n\"I would go as far to say that we won\u2019t have a successful implementation of the Affordable Care Act if we don\u2019t utilize nurse practitioners in primary care roles,\" Hansen-Turton says.\n\nBack at the new clinic in Milwaukee, nurse practitioner Susan Thaller is getting Earron Davis\u2019 medications in order.\n\nThe boy has asthma, just like many of the young patients in this neighborhood. Thaller also treats a lot of diabetes, hypertension and obesity.\n\n\"As a family nurse practitioner, I offer a holistic assessment and then primary care. In that assessment, mental health issues, growth and development issues,\" she says.\n\nThis clinic, and another new one in town, are operated by Children\u2019s Hospital of Wisconsin and Marquette University. Director Kerry Yamat says the clinics came about because neighbors lobbied for better health care options.\n\n\"Children\u2019s listened to the residents and realized that there was a need to provide closer access to health care in this community, so here we are today,\" Yamat says.\n\nThe response has been so good that one of the clinics has already expanded its hours. And there are plans to add even more nurses in the coming months.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-square310x310logo": "/assets/mstile-310x310-9380546aaae2d32ed4a1460d4ffac0ddd0197d240c08a97d9ba80e663f2f42e2.png", "application-name": "Marketplace from APM", "og": {"url": "http://www.marketplace.org/2014/03/05/health-care/nurse-led-clinics-no-doctors-required", "image": "http://cms.marketplace.org/sites/default/files/styles/primary-image-900x500/public/nurse1f.jpg?itok=TvwPl9bN", "type": "article", "description": "Some communities rely heavily on nurses to fill their healthcare needs.", "title": "Nurse-led clinics: No doctors required"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Marketplace"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFF", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/assets/mstile-70x70-797ef1ac7d8ffe040b98bab7140abf109b307280019c7d5c16c614ac6f66319d.png", "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/assets/mstile-310x150-11f7c8519056bc96bf2540c4b2aa8564178ebcae2594d3e8fb28d480f2c5cd8a.png", "csrf-token": "PqcrxWi3OWOMi5QQLQR78kY5+vi9vje/Ol06K9QOPaj23TMZKQVGhuM7MaECeiM0NXWBoV2sxptn1YHG9/swcg==", "msapplication-TileImage": "/assets/mstile-144x144-a9640051fbfb73c1de9771231343135b5f79295e3f98bb1cb87854aa6a74f8c8.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/assets/mstile-150x150-1d103d04b61aaa10bb165f225c46e694338b92918bc7a7ca2b99b54bdd1bbc0c.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "She says there are now 500 nurse-led clinics around the country, and the number will expand as providers look for less pricey ways to provide health care.\nIt\u2019s the 10 year-old\u2019s first visit to this new primary care clinic.\nNurse practitioner Susan Thaller and her patient, 10-year-old Earron Davis, at the new Children's Primary Care Clinic on Milwaukee's north side.\nDirector Kerry Yamat says the clinics came about because neighbors lobbied for better health care options.\nAlready, nearly a fifth of Americans live in areas with too few primary care physicians, and the shortage will only get worse as more people become insured."}
