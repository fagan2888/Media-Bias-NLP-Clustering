When all the actors in the commercials resemble some version of a \u201chipster,\u201d wryly delivering their lines with unmasked sarcasm, with expressionless faces (save the imperceptible hint of an eye roll), and with arms decidedly hanging straight down and never moving? When comedy gets to that point, what is one to do? Where do you go when \u201cfresh\u201d becomes \u201coverdone\u201d?\n\nYou cut it open and watch it bleed.\n\nThere have been different styles of television comedy over the years, the major players being the Slapstick (think I Love Lucy), the \u201cIntelligent,\u201d and the Snark. Comedy styles usually enjoy long-term success, so when there\u2019s a shift from one tone to another, it is often difficult to discourage everyone in comedy from using it. And overusing it.\n\nMore from DAME: \u201cRenee, I Totally Get It. I\u2019m About to Turn 48\u2033\n\nI\u2019m not going to send you too far back; let\u2019s just go to the 1980s. TV comedy of this era was generally of what I call the \u201cIntelligent\u201d type. These shows were not concerned with the standard \u201cset-up/joke\u201d pattern of sitcoms, where the punch lines could be delivered by anyone in the room, regardless of their character \u201ctype.\u201d These shows instead relied upon long-tail character development and on the viewers\u2019 understanding of these characters and of how they felt in any given situation. On these shows, \u201cJudy\u201d may deliver the joke\u2019s set-up and when the camera cuts to \u201cBob,\u201d the audience is so familiar with what he must be thinking that they burst into laughter long before he\u2019s audibly responded. The Cosby Show, Family Ties (full-disclosure, I was\u2026.), and Cheers used this form of comedy\u2014relied on it. This style continued on and this live-before-an-audience, multicamera comedic fare ruled the tube for some time.\n\nAnd then in 1989, Seinfeld came along and essentially capped the era with a comedic tone with which few TV audiences were familiar: snark. The out-the-corner-of-the-mouth, sometimes purely observational, comedy. It\u2019s generally devoid of actual engagement with the reality of the situation. It doesn\u2019t care about you. It was fresh at the time and it was funny. Previously, the closest comedy TV had gotten to snark was late-night talk-show hosts like Dave Letterman and sarcastic teenage characters. Every TV teenager, from Beaver Cleaver\u2019s big brother, Wally, to Roseanne\u2019s kids, especially middle daughter, Darlene, had had their measure of angst-ridden, eye-rolling, \u201cOh my God, I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m related to you\u201d soft-ball snark toward their parents, but it was always shot down like a drone at a Kings hockey victory party. Seinfeld, on the other hand, went ahead and filled an entire basket with it.\n\nThough the show was hugely successful, the \u201cfull snark\u201d didn\u2019t take hold of comedy completely until the arrival of Arrested Development, which pulled all the snark from Seinfeld and fed it Miracle-Gro. They then poured it vigorously down our throats. By the time we had caught our breath, this tone had infected all of comedy.\n\nAnd so it went on. And on. And on. And now that we were so damn smug and sarcastic in our comedy, where could we go? How could we proceed? Were we going to retreat and get \u201cintelligent\u201d again? Or start telling conservative jokes? Were we going to, instead, increase the sarcasm?\n\nEnter Danny McBride and his HBO show, Eastbound and Down. McBride had the solution. Cut it open. Cut human behavior, human experience, human nature wide open and make you look at it. So, as you watch this train wreck of to-the-bone comedy, you\u2019re laughing because it\u2019s funny, yes, but also because it hurts so much. You\u2019re looking at your species. You\u2019re looking at you.\n\nAnd then came Lena Dunham. Until Dunham came along, there was no \u201cfemale answer\u201d for the snark exit question. She entered the television-comedy arena (not incidentally, also on HBO) with knife in hand and full-vertical cuts on all limbs. But, while McBride allows us to see the evisceration of Kenny Power\u2019s rash, boisterous, braggadocio persona, Dunham splits open, instead, a newly graduated college student in Girls, with her alter ego Hannah Horvath, a young woman. A person who has yet to establish financial freedom from her parents. A woman not sure what she\u2019s doing. THIS she splits open and lets bleed.
