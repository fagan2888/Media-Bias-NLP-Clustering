You may remember how actress Jenny McCarthy became a touchstone for anti-vaccinators following her son’s diagnosis. While McCarthy claims she’s not part of an anti-vaccine movement, rather she’s “pro-safe vaccine,” she was a driving force behind the idea (and fear) vaccines can increase a child’s risk for autism, albeit studies suggesting the opposite. So comedian Amy Schumer used dog moms to poke fun at anti-vaxxers in the latest episode of Inside Amy Schumer.

To be fair, Schumer pokes fun at both groups: the women who treat their dogs like people, and the parents who don’t get their children vaccinated. After dropping her dog Addison off at doggy daycare, Schumer gets to talking with other moms about their pets. Each mom tries to one-up the other by sharing devastating details about their dog, from where they were rescued to their “severe body image issues.”

Schumer volunteers Addison suffers from FOMO — fear of missing out — to which one mom suggests she consider medication. Prozac and Valtrex are OK, but not vaccination. One mom says she didn’t get her “guy vaccinated because Jenny McCarthy said it can cause ‘pawtism.’” Schumer adds she follows McCarthy’s advice too, because “there’s nothing she doesn’t know.”
