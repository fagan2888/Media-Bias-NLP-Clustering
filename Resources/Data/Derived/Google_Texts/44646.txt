Elliot Point Elementary School was in lock-down for half an hour Friday while Okaloosa authorities searched for a man who ran away from a traffic stop.

23 year old Pierce Nelson was pulled over just after 8:00 a.m. Friday by the student resource deputy for speeding.

Nelson lied about his name and social security number before taking off on foot. The SRO deputy Jason Folley used his taser to subdue Nelson before taking him into custody.

Deputies found crack cocaine and drug paraphernalia including prescription bottles and marijuana. Nelson is charged with possession of cocaine with intent to distribute within 1,000 feet of a school, destroying or tampering with evidence, resisting arrest, and providing a false name.

Nelson is also wanted by the Florida Highway Patrol for a hit and run on Okaloosa Island.
