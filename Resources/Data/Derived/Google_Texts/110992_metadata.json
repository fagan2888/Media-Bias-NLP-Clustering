The data can be downloaded, but the website also includes tools that allow users to search by states or so-called public use microdata sample areas. PUMAs are geographic areas defined by the U.S. Census Bureau that divide the country into areas of at least 100,000 people.\n\nCheck out the maps\u2013and try clicking and dragging over a series of areas, or clicking on them separately; the tool will aggregate the data for you. Use the tabs at the top of the page to switch from states to PUMAs.\n\nThe database includes estimates produced by Robert Warren, which he derives from the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s American Community Survey. Mr. Warren is a senior visiting fellow at CMS, but he previously directed the statistics division at the former Immigration and Naturalization Service and was a demographer at the Census Bureau, where he helped pioneer a technique called the residual method to count undocumented immigrants.\n\nLearn more about the residual method in this week\u2019s Numbers column. That method is used today by the Department of Homeland Security and others to estimate the number of undocumented immigrants living in the U.S., but for his latest work, Mr. Warren takes a different approach.\n\nTo get down to smaller areas of geography and with greater demographic detail, his new work makes use of the Census microdata, which includes individual responses on topics such as relationship, sex, educational attainment and employment status.\n\n\u201cI believe these estimates are unique and important in a number of ways,\u201d Mr. Warren said. \u201cThey are unique in just the sheer amount of detail that they show for such small geographic areas. They are also the most up to date estimates available.\u201d\n\nAmong his findings at the national level:\n\nAbout two-thirds of unauthorized residents have access to a computer or the Internet\n\nMore than one-quarter have some college credits or a college degree\n\n55% speak English well or very well\n\nThe unemployment rate among undocumented immigrants is about 8%, a bit higher than U.S. rate\n\nAbout one-third have health insurance\n\n72% earn an income above the national poverty level\n\nUsing the dataset, this type of information can be broken down by smaller geographies, and Mr. Warren and CMS hope government officials, scholars and others will use the data to better understand the communities they serve.\n\nTo develop the new database, Mr. Warren reviewed individual microdata records to identify likely unauthorized immigrants. The methodology involved three major steps:\n\nApplying a series \u201clogical edits\u201d to identify and remove as many legal residents as possible based on responses in the survey\n\nDeriving separate population controls for 145 countries or areas for unauthorized residents counted in the 2010 ACS\n\nUsing those population controls to make final selections of individual respondents in the ACS to be classified as unauthorized residents.\n\n\u201cWe started with all noncitizens who entered after 1981, removed the ones judged to be legal residents, adjusted the results to country-by-country estimates, and, finally, adjusted those numbers for undercount to arrive at the total number of unauthorized immigrants,\u201d Mr. Warren said.\n\nThe full explanation of his methodology is online. Data for 2012 and 2013 are available on the CMS website, and Mr. Warren expects to make 2014 data available later this year.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "The Center for Migration Studies this month unveiled a new database of illegal immigrants broken down at national, state and sub-state levels.
