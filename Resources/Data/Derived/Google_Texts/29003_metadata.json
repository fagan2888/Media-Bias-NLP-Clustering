The seat is held by Democrat Chris Van Hollen, who is running for the Senate. (Evelyn Hockstein/For The Washington Post)\n\nDemocrats running for office in Montgomery County know they have to bring their A-game to Leisure World. The Silver Spring senior community of 8,000 is packed with active, knowledgeable voters who faithfully turn out for elections. It is a tough crowd, even for a seasoned politician.\n\nFormer news anchor Kathleen Matthews and wine retailer David Trone, two first-time candidates in the contest for Maryland\u2019s 8th District Democratic congressional nomination, found out just how tough at a Valentine\u2019s Day reception Sunday afternoon. Matthews and Trone, two of the three leading contenders in the April 26 primary, fielded two hours of often-blunt questions about their qualifications for office.\n\nThe skeptical tone was set by Democratic activist Paul Bardack, who asked Trone to explain the more than $150,000 he has contributed in recent years to state-level Republican candidates.\n\n\u201cWhy does your nationwide support for right-wing Republicans translate to your desire to get the Democratic nomination here in Maryland?\u201d he asked.\n\nTrone, making his first appearance at a candidate forum since entering the race Jan. 27 with a vow to self-fund his campaign, is one of the Democratic Party\u2019s most prolific fundraisers at the national level. He explained that the money to the GOP was simply the cost of doing business in many of the red states where his company, Total Wine & More, operates.\n\n[Congressional race pits incumbency vs. gender vs. business success]\n\n\u201cMy business interests are different than my personal interests,\u201d Trone said, adding that he had \u201cno connection whatsoever on a personal basis\u201d with the Republican candidates. His only objective, he said, was to expand markets for his stores.\n\n\u201cIf you want to get anything accomplished, you want anything done in the state of Texas or South Carolina or North Carolina \u2014 and all the things you\u2019ve gotten done are very pro-customer and narrow focus \u2014 you have to work with Republicans and Democrats,\u201d he said.\n\nOthers asked Matthews and Trone how, in the absence of legislative records, their merits as candidates could be assessed. And why, questioners wondered, hadn\u2019t they paid their dues by starting political careers at the board of education or county council?\n\n\u201cWe might not all have legislative records, but we have records,\u201d said Matthews, a former WJLA anchor and Marriott executive. \u201cTwenty-five years on television night after night covering your stories and gaining your trust.\u201d She also spoke of her decade as a top communications and government relations executive at Marriott, during which, she said, she moved a good but conservative company toward more enlightened approaches to the environment and treatment of LGBT employees and customers.\n\nTrone delivered probably his strongest response of the day, asking Leisure World residents, in essence: How have career politicians been working out for you?\n\n\u201cSo maybe we might argue that it\u2019s a good thing to be coming from outside the process and bringing some fresh ideas, some willingness to have change,\u201d Trone said. \u201cChange can be a really good thing. But if you just keep having the same old, same old, we\u2019re going to get the same old results, which are deplorable.\u201d\n\n[DNC says Obama praise of Trone not an endorsement]\n\nAnother novice candidate, former State Department congressional liaison Joel Rubin, said that Trone, far from an outsider, was part of a broken political system.\n\n\u201cWith all due respect, Mr. Trone, what you described in the beginning is exactly what is wrong with Washington,\u201d Rubin said. \u201cYou do not need to be buying legislatures in order to get results. . . . You can make change in Washington if you fight for it. You don\u2019t have to buy it.\u201d\n\nTo the question of how she would support labor unions if elected, Matthews pledged to protect the right to organize, citing her membership in the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (AFTRA, which merged with the Screen Actors Guild in 2012 to become SAG-AFTRA), and that of her husband, MSNBC\u2019s \u201cHardball\u201d host Chris Matthews, in the Directors Guild of America.\n\nShe also described herself as a \u201cvoice for unions\u201d at Marriott, which has had rocky labor relations at some of its hotels.\n\nTrone acknowledged that unions once played an important role \u201cwhen businesses treated workers so unfairly.\u201d But he said the 5,000 employees at Total Wine\u2019s more than 120 stores have never been compelled to organize.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re about family,\u201d Trone said, describing the good pay, benefits and meritocracy that were the basis of his operation.\n\nQuestioning highlighted some differences among the candidates. State Sen. Jamie B. Raskin (Montgomery) vowed to push for a \u201csingle-payer\u201d health insurance system rather than work to improve the Affordable Care Act, praising the national model in France, where he lived for a year. Nonprofit executive David Anderson, echoing other candidates, said Raskin\u2019s stance was unrealistic.\n\n\u201cIn an ideal world,\u201d the United States would have a single-payer system, Anderson said. \u201cBut we don\u2019t live in an ideal world. . . . This isn\u2019t France.\u201d\n\nAll contenders explained how they would excel at constituent service and praised the District 8 incumbent, Rep. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) for setting the standard. Matthews \u2014 who mentioned that her husband has a call into his office because of trouble getting his Social Security check \u2014 again cited her work as a journalist and corporate executive. Del. Ana Sol-Gutierrez (Montgomery) said that she sponsored legislation to make driver\u2019s licenses available to immigrants regardless of their legal status.\n\nDel. Kumar P. Barve (Montgomery) said he was the first elected official to go to the Maryland Public Service Commission and hold Pepco accountable for its poor response to the 2012 derecho. Raskin, who said that \u201ceverything we do in office is constituent service\u201d described his efforts to pass legislation allowing home delivery of wine, which drew a smile from Trone.\n\nFor the first time, the eight contenders (a ninth, Dan Bolling, was absent) were asked where they stood on the Democratic presidential race.\n\nGutierrez, Barve, Raskin and former Obama White House aide Will Jawando said they were undecided or not ready to endorse Hillary Clinton or Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont.\n\nTrone, Matthews, Anderson and Rubin said they stood with Clinton.", "article_metadata": {"description": "At the Valentine\u2019s Day forum, the candidates faced blunt questions about their qualifications.", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/bill.turque", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "At the Valentine\u2019s Day forum, the candidates faced blunt questions about their qualifications.", "title": "Matthews and Trone face tough questions from senior citizens", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/md-politics/matthews-and-trone-face-tough-questions-from-leisure-world-democrats/2016/02/15/c96a08e8-d36b-11e5-be55-2cc3c1e4b76b_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/01/28/Local/Images/2X7A00201453949706.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@bturque"}, "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/bill.turque"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "eomportal-uuid": "c96a08e8-d36b-11e5-be55-2cc3c1e4b76b"}, "article_summary": "Trone, Matthews, Anderson and Rubin said they stood with Clinton.\nMatthews and Trone, two of the three leading contenders in the April 26 primary, fielded two hours of often-blunt questions about their qualifications for office.\nOthers asked Matthews and Trone how, in the absence of legislative records, their merits as candidates could be assessed.\nDemocratic candidate Kathleen Matthews makes a point during a debate last month in Maryland\u2019s 8th District congressional race.\n\u201cWe might not all have legislative records, but we have records,\u201d said Matthews, a former WJLA anchor and Marriott executive."}
