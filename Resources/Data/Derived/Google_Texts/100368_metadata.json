The woman, who has not been identified, was taken to a hospital.\n\n\u201cI realize I have many detractors \u2026 and they will use this as \u2018ammunition\u2019 as always,\u201d Martino wrote to the 5,567 followers on his Facebook feed. \u201cThat is part of life. But for those who know my heart and soul \u2026 for those supporting and loving Holly and I through this and other rough times recently, we want you to know how much we appreciate you.\u201d\n\nReached on his cellphone by The Denver Post, Martino hung up. He did not return a subsequent call asking for a comment.\n\nDetails about the incident weren\u2019t yet available Sunday, but the arrest report is expected to be made public Monday morning, said Detective John White.\n\nBooking information shows Martino, 60, is free on $550 bail on charges of assault and disturbing the peace. He is scheduled for a Jan. 16 appearance in Denver County Court.\n\nOn Dec. 14, Martino mentioned stress in his family on his Facebook page, referencing his wife, Holly.\n\n\u201cHaven\u2019t posted in a very long time,\u201d he stated. \u201cBeen going through a lot of family stuff. My wife\u2019s brother recently passed away. He and his family had been living with us through the treatments for cancer. He and Holly grew up like \u2018twins\u2019 just a year apart.\u201d\n\nMartino, who calls himself \u201cThe Troubleshooter,\u201d has been a fixture in Denver media for three decades. He provides consumer advice, often taking combative stands, on 630-AM KHOW from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. weekdays.\n\nThe station had no news about Martino\u2019s arrest on its website Sunday.\n\nClear Channel Communications, KHOW\u2019s owner, released a statement saying the company had no comment on the arrest.\n\n\u201cAs far as Tom\u2019s show is concerned, it is presently on its pre-scheduled vacation,\u201d the company stated. The station\u2019s program director, Dan Mandis, said he did not know Sunday when Martino\u2019s vacation would end.\n\nMartino also has been the consumer advocate reporter for KCNC-CBS4 and KDVR-Fox31 during his career.
