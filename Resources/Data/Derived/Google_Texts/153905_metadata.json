Here are three reasons:\n\nTimeline\n\nThere\u2019s a real fear among House Republicans that moving immigration reform now could divide the party in a mid-term election year.\n\nDespite worries that the GOP would lose real ground among Latinos in national elections if immigration reform stalls, the majority of GOP House members come from districts without a substantial Latino population. In fact, 142 Republicans out the 232 in the House come from districts that are less than 10 percent Latino. Immigration just not a pressing issue for them \u2013 or a winning one.\n\nWithout a clear deadline for passing immigration reform \u2013 unlike the budget deadlines that so often drive legislative action \u2013 opponents asked Boehner why GOP leaders wanted reform now, before a tough election year that could yield Republican gains.\n\nPlay Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle Plus\n\nEmbed Boehner Warns Immigration Reform 'Difficult' This Year 1:29 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog\n\n\u2018Trust\u2019\n\nBoehner cited a lack of \u201ctrust\u201d between House Republicans and President Barack Obama \u2013 a very real sentiment from the House GOP conference. Rank-and-file Republicans feel the president has overplayed his hand constitutionally when it comes to executive actions on the Affordable Care Act, and they fear he\u2019d do the same thing regarding border security within an immigration reform bill. That\u2019s a red flag for members whose constituents worry that an immigration overhaul would end up attracting more undocumented immigrants.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that there\u2019s no direct proof that Obama would not enforce border security. Immigration reform advocates frequently point out the president\u2019s record levels of deportations, and their calls for executive action to halt them have so far gone stubbornly unheeded. And the Senate immigration bill that passed last year would have spent billions on border security and interior enforcement \u2013 something that even the top backer of those border security measures, Republican Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee, said was \u201cprobably overkill.\u201d\n\nBoehner\u2019s requirement that Obama \u201cearn back trust\u201d in the eyes of the American people or House Republicans is also very vague. The speaker offered no specific criteria for the president to meet, although Congress and the White House are continuing to grapple over the debt ceiling and unemployment insurance \u2013 both areas that could be ripe for negotiations.\n\nBottom line: many Republicans, mindful of their constituents\u2019 dislike of the president and his signature health care law, are simply wary to work with Obama on a controversial issue in an election year, and they believe there\u2019s no downside to punting to next year.\n\nBorder Security\n\nSince the beginning of the push on immigration reform, Republicans have made clear that their top priority is to \u201csecure the border first.\u201d But what constitutes border security for the House GOP Conference is relatively undefined. Unlike in the Senate bill, it\u2019s never been put down in legislation. Does a secure border mean drones? More fencing? Boots on the ground? And how costly is that proposition?\n\nImmigration rights protesters sit out in front of the House of Representatives after Arizona Gov.

Franklin / AP\n\nBoehner realized that the border security piece of the puzzle \u2013 not to mention unresolved issues over worker visas and legalization for undocumented immigrants \u2013 would be hard to resolve this year.\n\nSo what happens next?\n\nPerhaps a smaller piecemeal bill on immigration reform could happen at some point during the year but as long as border security remains an issue and GOP lawmakers don\u2019t want to take the plunge, immigration reform in 2014 seems more unlikely than ever today.\n\nNBC\u2019s Carrie Dann contributed.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Why did John Boehner slam on the brakes on immigration reform?
