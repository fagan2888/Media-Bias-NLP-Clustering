Legislators have voted to count pregnancy as a “life event” — making New York the first state in the country to let pregnant women sign up for Obamacare outside the designated enrollment period.

Before the vote late Wednesday, events like having a baby, getting married and even getting out of jail counted as “life events” that allow people to sign up or change insurance plans on the state’s health exchange outside the designated enrollment period — but becoming pregnant did not.

The state Senate and Assembly unanimously passed the bills.
