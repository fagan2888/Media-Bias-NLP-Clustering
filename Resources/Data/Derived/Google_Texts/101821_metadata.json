It is an explanation, but not a defence, to point out that the AA\u2019s pollsters say 300,000 people have swapped speeding points and that it seemed like a minor matter back in 2003.\n\n\n\n\u2018I should not have done it. The personal consequences were monstrous for my family and me, including two months in prison.\u2019\n\n'I am no saint... but nor did I claim to be'\n\nChris Huhne\n\n\n\nBut he added: \u2018The News of the World sparked the end of my marriage, but another Murdoch title, the Sunday Times, then groomed my ex-wife until she told them about the speeding points.\n\n\u2018The political editor bought dinners, sent flowers, offered breaks at smart hotels, and reassured her that she would not face any unpleasant consequences (such as prison).\u2019\n\nHe went on to write: \u2018The moral of this story? First, none of this would have been possible without my own mistakes. I am no saint (but nor did I claim to be).\n\n\n\n\u2018Second, politicians now have to live with a 24-hour media, which is more intrusive and hurtful for the people they love, and this is having a corrosive effect on how the public view politicians, and politics itself.\n\n\n\n\u2018Ultimately, the new media aggression is not just a problem for those individuals directly affected, it is a problem for us all.\u2019\n\nCouple: Huhne's marriage collapsed when the Press revealed he was having an affair with Carina Trimingham\n\nIn a radio interview this morning Huhne went further, claiming he was a victim of a conspiracy by the Murdoch empire to further the media mogul's business interests.\n\nHe said the News of the World had known about his affair before the 2010 general election but delayed publication until a month after polling day 'when at that time Murdoch was, of course, trying to get approval to buy the rest of BSkyB'.\n\nBut the story was also exposed on the same day by the Sunday People newspaper, and as Energy Secretary Huhne had no role to play in media regulation.\n\nHuhne told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'You know, you would have thought if they knew that I was lying before the election then that\u2019s the time when they should have run the story.\n\n'So I think the very clear implication here, just by the coincidence of when the investigation starts, the fact the story is not then run until substantially later suggests that there is another agenda.\n\n'I\u2019m saying very clearly I take responsibility for my own mistakes I would not have been vulnerable if I had not things which I regret and were clearly wrong.\n\n'But what I am pointing out, from I suppose a rather unique vantage point, is sometimes newspaper groups and media groups have their own interests as well.", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "news_keywords": "Chris,Huhne,blames,media,speeding,points,scandal", "original-source":
