( Cliff Grassmick / Staff Photographer )\n\nWhittier Elementary first-graders clustered around a small raised bed garden last week as they got a lesson on lettuce and planting.\n\nUndeterred by the falling snow and chilly temperature, they used small shovels to dig holes and plant the bed with rows of green and red lettuce starts, four varieties in all. Rulers helped with spacing.\n\nWhittier's garden is one of 18 at Boulder Valley elementary schools planted through the Growe Foundation, which developed the Garden to Table program.\n\n\"It brings in lessons of where food comes from and really connects the kids to healthy eating,\" said Bryce Brown, who founded the Growe Foundation.\n\nThe program reaches about 8,000 students a year. Along with helping schools plant gardens and providing seeds and plants, the foundation partnered with teachers to write curriculum that meshes with state standards.\n\nGarden to Table is a community effort, with principals and teachers leading the garden efforts at each school, parents volunteering their time, Cure Farm growing the seedlings and businesses providing both monetary support and volunteers.\n\nAt Whittier, the first-graders collected seeds from previously planted lettuce in the fall, setting the stage for the spring planting.\n\nLater this spring, second-graders will harvest the lettuce crop, which will be served as part of a school lunch highlighting salad bar veggies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn planting day, first-grader Luca Coakley said he learned that \"there are many kinds of lettuce\" and liked getting to dig in the garden.\n\nFirst-grader Sophia Hultquist said she learned about caring for plants.\n\n\"You need to water it, or else it could die,\" she said. \"Sometimes when they're cold, they die. You can put a blanket on them if it's cold.\"\n\nThe best part of a garden, added classmate Olive Tromey, is \"we get to eat it.\"\n\nTheir teacher, Erin Cameron, said the garden to table program fits well with Whittier's International Baccalaureate program.\n\n\"We teach what it means to be a human,\" she said. \"Taking care of the Earth and planting vegetables is a human need. And planting is hands on. They're doing something with their knowledge. Kids who plant the lettuce are a lot more invested in taking care of the garden.\"\n\nAmy Bounds: 303-473-1341, boundsa@dailycamera.com or twitter.com/boundsa", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-county-schools/ci_29656813/whittier-elementary-students-plant-lettuce-future-all-school", "sailthru.author": "By Amy Bounds \n \n  Staff Writer", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:29656813:view"}, "startDate": "2016-03-19T14:00:00-0600", "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "Whittier Elementary first-graders clustered around a small raised bed garden last week as they got a lesson on lettuce and planting.", "title": "Whittier Elementary students plant lettuce for future all-school salad", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-county-schools/ci_29656813/whittier-elementary-students-plant-lettuce-future-all-school", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2016/0318/20160318__20DCAGARw~1.jpg", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Boulder Education & Schools", "modificationDate": "2016-03-18T14:37:29-0600", "endDate": "2026-03-18T14:25:42-0600", "news_keywords": "news information  boulder county schools elementary middle high preps", "byline": "By Amy BoundsStaff", "pubDate": "2016-03-18T14:38:38-0600", "sailthru.date": "2016-03-19T14:00:00-0600", "sailthru.title": "Whittier Elementary students plant lettuce for future all-school salad", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2016/0318/20160318__20DCAGARw~1_300.jpg", "description": "Whittier Elementary first-graders clustered around a small raised bed garden last week as they got a lesson on lettuce and planting.", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-county-schools/ci_29656813/whittier-elementary-students-plant-lettuce-future-all-school", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "Whittier Elementary first-graders clustered around a small raised bed garden last week as they got a lesson on lettuce and planting.", "title": "Whittier Elementary students plant lettuce for future all-school salad"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}, "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2016/0318/20160318__20DCAGARw~1.jpg"}, "article_summary": "First-graders at Whittier International Elementary School in Boulder are planting lettuce in their garden for the garden to table program.\n'We get to eat it'Sid Markell, left, and Olive Tromey, prepare to plant lettuce with help from Diana Mercer.\n( Cliff Grassmick / Staff Photographer )Whittier Elementary first-graders clustered around a small raised bed garden last week as they got a lesson on lettuce and planting.\nWhittier's garden is one of 18 at Boulder Valley elementary schools planted through the Growe Foundation, which developed the Garden to Table program.\nTheir teacher, Erin Cameron, said the garden to table program fits well with Whittier's International Baccalaureate program."}
