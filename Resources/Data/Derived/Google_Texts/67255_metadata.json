In the past, several spices have been found contaminated with Salmonella or chemicals, and now you can add McCormick\u2019s Ground Oregano to the list. McCormick & Company issued a recall this week after finding that some packages of the spice could contain Salmonella.\n\nThe recall comes after a routine test from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) found that the oregano could be contaminated with Salmonella. The agency immediately alerted McCormick & Co., and 1,032 cases of the spice were recalled. Distributors were told to take all potentially contaminated products off their shelves. Other McCormick ground or whole spices were not affected by the recall.\n\nThe recalled oregano includes all 0.75-ounce bottles with the UPC code 0-523561-6, and \u201cBest By\u201d dates of Aug. 21, 2016 and Aug. 22, 2016. The shipping dates for the recalled spices were from April 4, 2014 to Aug. 5, 2014. They were shipped to nearly every state, as well as internationally, to Aruba, the Bahamas, Bermuda, Indonesia, Jamaica, the Netherlands, Puerto Rico, Singapore, Thailand, and the Virgin Islands. No illnesses were reported.\n\nThose who purchased the recalled items should not return them to the stores where they were purchased, but should throw them out along with their containers instead, the FDA said. This is not the first time that there\u2019s been a recall like this. Earlier this month, the FDA recalled Sunfood\u2019s Organic Carob Powder for Salmonella, and last month the FDA recalled Ecoato Sweet Paprika Powder for the same thing.\n\nWhat is it about these spices that makes them so vulnerable to harmful bacteria? Spices, especially fresh ones sold in farmer's markets, tend to be key contributors to foodborne illnesses. In a May study, researchers from Kansas State University found dead whole insects, insect parts, human hair, and other contaminants in batches of black pepper, thyme, oregano, and turmeric. They also reported that some of the spices they purchased from farmer\u2019s markets tested positive for Salmonella. This happens because organic spices in farmer's markets tend to be uncovered, allowing people to touch them freely, and insects to land inside. In the case of the McCormick oregano, the spice may have been contaminated while factory workers handled it.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC ), 48 million Americans get sick from the food they eat each year. Contaminated produce is responsible for nearly half of all illnesses. Salmonella, which is commonly linked to fresh produce, causes about 1.2 million illnesses in the United States every year. The bacteria can cause diarrhea, vomiting, fever, and abdominal cramps, according to the CDC. It can also become fatal if it enters the bloodstream.\n\nYour oven is one of your best tools to help reduce your chances of getting sick from Salmonella. It\u2019s recommended that spices be added to food before cooking, rather than after, so that all harmful bacteria can be destroyed. The CDC says that cleanliness is also helpful in eradicating Salmonella. Wipe down all surfaces that touch raw meat or eggs with soap and water, and wash fruits and vegetables thoroughly before eating or cooking.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "salmonella, food borne illness, produce, oregano, mccormick ground oregano, fda", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "After FDA routine testing, the agency discovered that some McCormick Ground Oregano products may contain harmful Salmonella.
