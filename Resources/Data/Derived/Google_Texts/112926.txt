The owner of a dog hit by a car in Denver, which died 90 minutes later as police stood by, wants at least an apology from police.

Dani Juras said her 14-year-old black Lab mix, Harley, escaped out a door that her kids accidently left open Wednesday night.

Juras posted fliers of Harley throughout her neighborhood and on animal websites before she saw the video on 7News.

The video shows the dog gasping in the street as police prevented a neighbor from helping it.

Police called Animal Control 15 minutes after arriving to the scene, but it took the on-call Animal Control officer more than an hour to arrive because he came from his home.

Police have explained that injured dogs are unpredictable and helping them puts both the animal and the good Samaritan at risk. Police posted a YouTube video Friday in which a veterinarian and Animal Control officer both explain why it’s best to wait for professionals to handle any injured animal.

After watching the police explanation, Juras said she wasn’t buying it.

The dog was hit on West 21st Avenue and Federal Boulevard — two blocks from her house.

“I would like to see the officers that were involved, whether it’s a reprimand, whether it’s a fine, I would like to see them be held accountable,” Juras said.

Juras said she is grateful for Ross Knapp, the neighbor who tried to intervene.

An online petition demanding an apology from DPD has more than 5,000 signatures.

Juras said she signed the online petition herself before she discovered it was her dog.
