The thrice-married New Yorker with a history of supporting socially liberal policies received a resounding welcome at the United States\u2019 premier university for evangelical Christians. At about the same time, the elected representatives of the United Kingdom, by far the closest international ally the U.S. has, stood in line for three hours to insult him and, in many cases, to argue that he should be barred from their shores.\n\nTrump, who has been leading the race for the Republican presidential nomination in national polls with almost no exceptions since last summer, made an appearance at Liberty University in Lynchburg, Va., to continue his efforts to woo evangelicals.\n\nRelated: Trump and Cruz Feud Ignites into a Full-Blown War as Race Tightens\n\nThe crowd at the gathering was large -- attendance was mandatory for students -- but Trump has never had trouble drawing mobs of supporters. What was particularly interesting was his introduction by Liberty president Jerry Falwell Jr., son of the school\u2019s founder.\n\nThough Falwell insisted that Trump\u2019s appearance did not constitute an endorsement \u2013 indeed, Liberty has hosted candidates certain to never receive its blessing, including Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders \u2013 his introduction of the former reality television star sounded an awful lot like one.\n\nCalling Trump a \u201cbreath of fresh air,\u201d Falwell said, \u201cIn my opinion, Donald Trump lives a life of loving and helping others, as Jesus taught in the great commandment.\u201d\n\nFalwell went on to say that he believes the country is \u201cfinally ready to elect a candidate who is not a career politician but rather who has succeeded in real life.\u201d\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s How Ted Cruz Makes Donald Trump Look Acceptable\n\nTrump came in for some ridicule from the media on Monday for clumsily quoting scripture, but in reality, anybody who thought Trump was a serious student of the Bible came into Monday\u2019s performance with some seriously skewed expectations in the first place.\n\nWhile press reports from Lynchburg found a few Liberty students dubious about Trump, the tycoon was generally well received. That offered a stark contrast to what was happening at the same time across the Atlantic.\n\nTrump\u2019s attacks on Muslims, Mexicans and other ethnic and religious groups have infuriated many people, including more than a few outside the U.S. The U.K. has a mechanism for compelling Parliament to debate a subject of public interest if enough people sign a petition requesting it. On Monday, the issue in question was whether or not the government should ban Trump from entering the country.\n\nThe debate wasn\u2019t completely without merit or precedent. The U.K. has banned some foreign individuals it views as peddling hate speech, including American anti-Islam crusader Pamela Geller. However, the chance that the U.K. would preemptively ban someone with a non-trivial chance of becoming president of its closest ally was never particularly high.\n\nRelated: Trump\u2019s Attacks on Cruz Take on a Desperate Tone\n\nOf course, that didn\u2019t stop members of the House of Commons from standing in line to blast Trump in what appeared to be an effort to exhaust the British lexicon of insults acceptable in public discourse.\n\nMember of Parliament Gavin Newlands, for example, said that he had exhausted his patience attempting to find a more polite term to describe Trump, and simply said that the leading GOP candidate is \u201can idiot.\u201d\n\nOthers threw in \u201cbuffoon\u201d and \u201cdemagogue,\u201d as well as some colorful and specifically British insults, like \u201cwazzock.\u201d But the net result in the end was that, even among those who oppose the idea of banning a potential U.S. president from the county, the general consensus was that Trump is more worthy of ridicule than respect.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Monday was, to say the least, an odd day for Donald Trump.
