John Hickenlooper defied all convention, all health and environmental fears about the Animas River, and took a drink of its water five days after 3 million gallons of pollution turned it orange.\n\nThe stunt came in response to a dare from the local media and Hickenlooper\u2019s desire to show that the river is no longer a health hazard and that Durango, the southwestern Colorado city that considers the river its lifeblood, is open for business.\n\nBut the viral images of Hickenlooper drinking the water \u2014 which he first treated with iodine to kill bacteria and pathogens \u2014 also showcase the unusual political currents that flowed from the Aug. 5 wastewater spill triggered by the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nAnd how the EPA handles the spill is likely to affect its fragile reputation in Colorado, where local officials and businesses complain about a broader assault from the federal government on the Western way of life.\n\nHickenlooper, a Democrat, put himself at odds with the Obama administration from the start as he blasted the agency\u2019s slow response and, from the banks of the river, eschewed the normal course in disasters.\n\nInstead of highlighting the damage to provoke quicker action from federal authorities, the governor forcefully dismissed cautions about water quality in a public argument with the region\u2019s EPA administrator.\n\n\u201cThe point I was trying to make is that the river is back to normal,\u201d Hickenlooper said in an interview after returning from Durango. \u201cThere\u2019s a silver lining in all this. It doesn\u2019t appear there is going to be lasting environmental damage or significant environmental damage, and what most of us were fearful of didn\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\nBut local leaders took a more measured approach in the days after the spill, emphasizing concerns about the long-term damage to the river, where heavy metals and toxins may lie in the river bottom sediment.\n\nState Senate President pro tem Ellen Roberts, a Durango Republican, suggested the governor\u2019s big sip from the river sent the wrong message.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have done that,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was a bit of a head-scratching move. I believe it was well-intentioned, but I think, frankly, we have too many public health and safety concerns right now.\u201d\n\nDan Olson, the executive director of the Durango-based San Juan Citizens Alliance environmental group, said he hopes the environmental damage isn\u2019t so easily dismissed.\n\n\u201cThis event made visual \u2014 dramatically \u2014 the pollution we live with so people could not ignore it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you already see, as the water column clears, how people are rushing back to their positions, their hope or belief that everything is good here, nothing to see, let\u2019s move along.\u201d\n\nResponding to questions about the possible long-term effects, Hickenlooper said heavy metals on the river bottom are \u201cnormal sediment\u201d and state scientists showed him \u201creally good evidence that the river came back to its natural state \u2014 well, not its natural state, to its normal state.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook, I\u2019m a geologist, right? I recognize that you have to test everything and retest it and get redundant experiments,\u201d said Hickenlooper, who once drank fracking fluid to make a point. \u201cBut the science that we have so far suggests that we don\u2019t have the natural calamity \u2026 that so many of us were fearful of when we first saw those pictures.\u201d\n\nFor a governor, said Bob Loevy, professor emeritus of political science at Colorado College, a disaster is a legacy-defining moment, and Hickenlooper\u2019s reputation may depend on what scientists find in coming days and months.\n\n\u201cI think he has a political liability if he doesn\u2019t show he was right and show the state has taken a role in ensuring the river gets cleaned up,\u201d Loevy said. \u201cHow long this is a political liability for him depends on how bad the damage really turns out to be and how long it takes to clean it up.\u201d\n\nFloyd Ciruli, a Denver-based pollster and political consultant, said the coloring of the river was so dramatic \u201cthat I think people are going to be naturally concerned about the long-term residual impact.\u201d\n\nJohn Frank: 303-954-2409, jfrank@denverpost.com or twitter.com/ByJohnFrank\n\nStaff writer Kevin Simpson contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Animas River spill\u2019s political fallout defies expectations", "title": "Animas River spill\u2019s political fallout defies expectations", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/08/15/animas-river-spills-political-fallout-defies-expectations/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150815__20150816_B1_CD16PCOHICKANIMASp1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150815__20150816_B1_CD16PCOHICKANIMASp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-15T19:02:18+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T12:15:36+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Animas River-Spill, Pollution, Water"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThe point I was trying to make is that the river is back to normal,\u201d Hickenlooper said in an interview after returning from Durango.\nIn a Donald Trump-esque political moment, Colorado Gov.\nState Senate President pro tem Ellen Roberts, a Durango Republican, suggested the governor\u2019s big sip from the river sent the wrong message.\n\u201cI think he has a political liability if he doesn\u2019t show he was right and show the state has taken a role in ensuring the river gets cleaned up,\u201d Loevy said.\nJohn Hickenlooper defied all convention, all health and environmental fears about the Animas River, and took a drink of its water five days after 3 million gallons of pollution turned it orange."}
