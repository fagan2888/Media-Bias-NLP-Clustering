Metalworking machinery manufacturing is another industry that you should avoid, as sales grew only 1.4 percent.\n\nGas Stations: Revenue barely budged for most gas stations owners in the country, as sales increased by only 0.1 percent in the 12 months ended Aug. 31. Privately-owned gas stations also typically have some of the smallest profit margins within retail, according to Sageworks.\n\nRelated: The 10 Best Cities for Small Businesses\n\nGrocery Stores: As more consumers are shopping for groceries at large supermarket chains or online, most independent grocery stores are struggling. Sales increased by 3.2 percent in the past 12 months.\n\nJewelry, luggage and leather goods stores: Increased competition in these retail categories including from consumers switching to online shopping, have resulted in poor revenue growth in the past year, when sales grew 1.7 percent.\n\nPaper and Paper product Merchant Wholesalers: With everything going digital and an increasing number of consumers and companies switching to paperless, it\u2019s no wonder this industry isn\u2019t growing. Sales increased by only 2 percent in the 12 months ended Aug. 31.\n\nTo be sure, entrepreneurs should consider revenue growth in concert with other financial metrics, including cash flow, liquidity and profitability, to fully understand the health of a company and of an industry, but slow revenue growth is an early red flag of a slow-growing industry.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "If you\u2019re looking to launch your own business, you should avoid some of the slowest-growing industries, most of which are related to manufacturing, wholesale and retail.", "title": "5 Slow-Growing Small Business Industries", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/09/08/5-Slow-Growing-Small-Business-Industries", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/09082014_Slow_Business_Snail_Money_Coins.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/09/08/5-Slow-Growing-Small-Business-Industries", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/09082014_Slow_Business_Snail_Money_Coins.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "If you\u2019re looking to launch your own business, you should avoid some of the slowest-growing industries, most of which are related to manufacturing, wholesale and retail.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd02e5\"", "article_summary": "Financial information firm Sageworks recently analyzed private-company financial statements and identified 15 industries that have had either negative or minuscule sales growth over the past year.\n\u201cIndividuals looking for good business ideas and companies looking for strong investment opportunities may have cause to be wary of these industries,\u201d said Sageworks analyst Libby Bierman, in a press release.\nTo be sure, entrepreneurs should consider revenue growth in concert with other financial metrics, including cash flow, liquidity and profitability, to fully understand the health of a company and of an industry, but slow revenue growth is an early red flag of a slow-growing industry.\nIf you\u2019re considering a job offer or looking to launch your own business, you should avoid the slowest-growing industries, most of which are related to manufacturing, wholesale and retail.\nSales increased by only 2 percent in the 12 months ended Aug. 31."}
