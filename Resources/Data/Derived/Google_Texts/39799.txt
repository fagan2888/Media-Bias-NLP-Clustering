A screening system for the state's Children's Medical Services program has resulted in the removal of 9,000 poor and disabled children from the program, the Miami Herald reports.

Records obtained by the Herald show the screening process has helped reduce spending on the program converted a few years ago from a fee-for-service plan into managed care. Former CMS division director Phyllis Sloyer told the Herald the screening is "definitely rationing of care" for the state's sickest children.

Florida Surgeon General John Armstrong said the changes were designed to comply with state law, and maintained that the program remains strong, the Herald reports.
