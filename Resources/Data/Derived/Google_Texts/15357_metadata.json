Daniel Patrick Moynihan\u2019s quote that, \u201ceveryone is entitled to his own opinion, but not to his own facts,\u201d it disregards the way competing partisans craft their own side\u2019s arguments.\n\nSins of omission, not commission or \u201ctruthiness,\u201d are the problems with political spin. No one wants to explain \u201cthe whole truth.\u201d And surprise: the reason is because it\u2019s mixed. The whole truth is complicated and nuanced; it rarely redounds exclusively to one side\u2019s benefit.\n\n[See a collection of political cartoons on Congress.]\n\nAs National Journal\u2019s Ron Fournier has explained, \u201cboth Republicans and Democrats are vastly oversimplifying the [new Congressional Budget Office] report and the effects of the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhile Fournier puts more blame on the GOP for their negative framing and factual cherry-picking, in politics, it\u2019s always good to remember that that was yesterday, this is today. In other words, yesterday\u2019s many inaccurate and cryptic headlines gave the Republicans a gift. And if they hadn\u2019t exploited their myriad messaging opportunities, we\u2019d have to again start wondering about the party\u2019s overall political competency.\n\nBut now, that more people have perused and digested the 170-page report, we\u2019re sure to hear a Democratic response, beginning with this statement from the White House.\n\n[See a collection of political cartoons on the Republican Party.]\n\nBumper stickers and Tweets are soon to follow. Here\u2019s a few of the Democratic ones that may yet arise from the facts in the CBO report (available shortly at the Zazzle store).\n\nUnemployment Falling, Inflation No Problem: Obamanomics Works\n\nTranslation: \u201cThe unemployment rate falls to 5.5 percent by 2024, and inflation stays at 2.0 percent between 2018 and 2024.\u201d (p.27)\n\nObamacare Flex-hours: Yoga for Your Career\n\nTranslation: A shrinking labor force with 2.5 million fewer full-time-equivalent positions by 2024. (p.117)\n\nDeficit Down, Obamacare Up: Democrats Do Government Best\n\nTranslation: $514 billion deficit in 2014 and 6 million people to receive insurance through exchanges in 2014. (p.95, 107)\n\n[See a collection of political cartoons on Obamacare.]\n\nNational Debt: Still below 1950\n\nTranslation: \u201cDebt held by the public increased by more than $700 billion in 2013, reaching 72 percent of GDP, higher than the percentage in 2012 (70 percent) or in any other year since 1950.\u201d (p.16)\n\nSelective extraction and context-free assertions are the currency of political spin. The only way to not be duped by the partisan-crafted CBO-based slogans is to read the report and make up your own mind about the state of the federal budget, the nation\u2019s economy and the benefits and drawbacks of the Affordable Care Act. It\u2019s no thrill-ride novel, but then, no one ever said participating in a democracy was easy.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion]", "title": "A CBO Report on Obamacare That Everyone Can Love", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Both sides can selectively choose facts from the latest report on Obamacare.", "title": "A CBO Report With Something for Everyone", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/lara-brown/2014/02/05/a-cbo-report-on-obamacare-that-everyone-can-love", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/77/1f/8cb46a1a4d1a903b7ca4872884b4/toon5.tif", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@USNews", "description": "Both sides can selectively choose facts from the latest report on Obamacare.", "card": "summary", "title": "A CBO Report on Obamacare That Everyone Can Love"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "opinion", "date_published": "Feb. 5, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Lara Brown,Democratic Party,Republican Party,Congressional Budget Office,picks,Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion]", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Both sides can selectively choose facts from the latest report on Obamacare."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca1de\"", "article_summary": "Sins of omission, not commission or \u201ctruthiness,\u201d are the problems with political spin.\n(p.95, 107)[See a collection of political cartoons on Obamacare.]\nHere\u2019s a few of the Democratic ones that may yet arise from the facts in the CBO report (available shortly at the Zazzle store).\n[See a collection of political cartoons on Congress.]\n[See a collection of political cartoons on the Republican Party.]"}
