At the end of last year debt stood at 3.3 billion euros.\n\nOrders, which fell 2.3 percent last year on a weak performance of its helicopter division, are expected to remain little changed this year at 12.2-12.7 billion euros.\n\nThe company will hold a conference call on Thursday morning on the 2015 results.\n\n(Reporting by Giulia Segreti and Stephen Jewkes, editing by David Evans)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/03/16/Finmeccanica-calls-Leonardo-mark-turnaround", "type": "article", "site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Since coming to office in May 2014, Chief Executive Mauro Moretti has launched a restr", "title": "Finmeccanica calls on 'Leonardo' to mark turnaround"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/03/16/Finmeccanica-calls-Leonardo-mark-turnaround", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Since coming to office in May 2014, Chief Executive Mauro Moretti has launched a restr", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1f82\"", "article_summary": "The state-controlled conglomerate announced on Wednesday it would rename the company \"Leonardo\", in a clear reference to Renaissance artist and genius Leonardo da Vinci.\nFree operating cash flow in 2015 jumped almost five-fold to 307 million euros ($344 million), Finmeccanica said, boosted by the sale of rail signaling units Ansaldo STS to Japan's Hitachi.\nOrders, which fell 2.3 percent last year on a weak performance of its helicopter division, are expected to remain little changed this year at 12.2-12.7 billion euros.\nAt the end of last year debt stood at 3.3 billion euros.\nThe fall in oil prices, a slowdown in emerging markets and cuts in state defense budgets have dampened demand for military equipment across the sector."}
