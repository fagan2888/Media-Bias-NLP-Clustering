She is a journalism fellow with The Phillips Foundation, a prestigious conservative organization in Washington, D.C., where she spent a year researching and writing about private property rights.\n\nFrom traffic light cameras to phone tapping, from militarized police forces to huge purchase orders by departments of the federal government for billions of rounds of ammunition, the government is unfettered in its desire to control the American people. \u201cPolice State USA\u201d chronicles how America reached this point.\n\nChumley\u2019s timely book makes the clear case that we now live in a total surveillance society far more frightening than the one Orwell wrote about in his work of fiction, \u201c1984.\u201d\n\nOrder your copy now of Cheryl Chumley\u2019s Police State USA.\n\nIn the foreword to Chumley\u2019s book, Gohmert writes:\n\nLook at what we know the government already has accessed. Under Obamacare, the federal government now gets complete documentation of your deepest, darkest, most personal secrets in your medical records that only your doctor once knew until the government decided to help you.\n\nYour revelations to your doctor were completely secret, and our courts used to protect that precious doctor-patient relationship with full-blown privacy rights. Now, without a single Republican vote, the Democrats in the House and Senate decided that those full-blown rights should be fully blown up because the omniscient, ubiquitous, all-knowing, all-caring federal government needs to be in full control of our lives.\n\nThose Democrats are hoping that the governmental god in whom they trust will be more trustworthy in controlling our lives than it is in controlling and operating a website,\u201d he said.\n\nThe coming signs of tyranny are all around us. Fortunately, they can be stopped before it is too late, but not without a courageous effort. This nation\u2019s founders risked absolutely everything to secure the blessings of freedom. We only risk some belittling by the mainstream and government harassment for preserving those freedoms. Bottom line, the data in Chumley\u2019s book concerns me and it should concern you.\n\nThe book describes the case of a former Marine living in Virginia.\n\nIt was August 2012, and he \u201cwas taken into custody, thrown in jail, and forcibly transferred to a hospital located nearly three hours from his home and family to undergo a psychiatric evaluation, all at the order of law enforcement officials.\u201d\n\n\u201cHis crime? He posted on his private Facebook page messages that painted the government in a poor light.\u201d\n\nThen there was the July 2013 case of a University of Virginia student. She was \u201cswarmed by state Alcoholic Beverage Control agents who thought the carton of bottled water she was carrying across the parking lot of a grocery store was really a 12-pack of beer and she was an underage buyer.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe said one drew her gun, another jumped on the hood of her SUV, and still others shouted conflicting orders and flashed badges she couldn\u2019t read. Terrified, she tried to flee in her SUV, but agents halted and arrested her, charging her with two counts of assault.\n\n\u201cEven the commonwealth\u2019s attorney who investigated the incident found the case ridiculous and refused to prosecute. But the 20-year-old still spent a night in jail \u2013 for the crime of purchasing water.\u201d\n\n\n\nMedia wishing to interview author Cheryl Chumley may contact media@wnd.com.\n\nSee a trailer:", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "Cheryl Chumley, author of \u201cPolice State USA: How Orwell\u2019s Nightmare is Becoming Our Reality,\u201d will be featured in a two-hour interview on the popular \u201cCoast to Coast AM\u201d program late Tuesday night and early Wednesday morning.
