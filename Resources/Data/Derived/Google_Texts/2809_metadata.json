One lawmaker recalled comparisons to Travelocity, the travel booking site.\n\nIn fact, the rosy presentations set President Obama up for even more criticism when the portal was swamped by millions of people who quickly found out they could not log on. The technical problems that emerged have raised questions \u2014 still not entirely answered \u2014 about how much the president\u2019s aides knew, or should have known, about the site\u2019s troubles.\n\n\u201cWe knew this was a complex undertaking but did not see the huge volume of demand coming,\u201d Mr. McDonough said in an interview this week. \u201cAnd that volume has exacerbated, as the president said the other day, the underlying problems. The fact is we\u2019ll get to the bottom of it and get it fixed.\u201d\n\nThe issue of when administration officials recognized the Web site\u2019s potential for major problems has emerged as one of the key political talking points on Capitol Hill. During a hearing Thursday of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, angry lawmakers grilled executives from the private companies hired to design and build the site about whether they had warned government officials.\n\nThe executives testified that \u201cend to end\u201d testing of the Web site did not take place until two weeks before the site made its debut \u2014 about the same time that the briefings by Mr. Simas and Mr. McDonough were taking place. And they said problems with the software that powers the Web site were communicated to senior officials in the president\u2019s administration.\n\nCheryl R. Campbell, a senior vice president of CGI Federal, a unit of the CGI Group, the main contractor on the federal exchange, said that all of her company\u2019s work had been done \u201cunder the direction and supervision\u201d of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, known as C.M.S.\n\nAndrew M. Slavitt, the UnitedHealth executive responsible for Quality Software Services, told lawmakers that \u201cwe made everyone aware of the risks that we saw.\u201d He added later, \u201cWe informed C.M.S. that more testing was necessary.\u201d\n\nSome specialists involved in the repair effort have estimated it will be six to eight weeks before the online system operates tolerably, and longer before all the kinks are worked out.\n\nAccording to some accounts, the project\u2019s managers at the Department of Health and Human Services assured the White House that any remaining problems could be worked out once the Web site went live, but other senior department officials predicted serious trouble and advised delaying the rollout.\n\nBut on a conference call with reporters on Thursday, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services officials twice declined to answer questions about whether Kathleen Sebelius, Mr. Obama\u2019s health secretary, knew about the problems. Asked if Marilyn Tavenner, the agency\u2019s director, or anyone else had alerted Ms. Sebelius, an official cut off a reporter.\n\n\u201cNext question,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. McDonough said in the interview that officials \u201canticipated bumps and glitches and problems.\u201d But he and other White House officials declined to say specifically what information officials at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the Health and Human Services Department communicated to their counterparts at the White House before the Web site was opened to the public.\n\nJay Carney, the White House press secretary, said this week that \u201cwe did not know until the problems manifested themselves after the launch that they would be as significant as they have turned out to be.\u201d\n\nThe briefings in late September, including one for editors and reporters at The New York Times on Sept. 26, were designed to counter assertions by Republicans that the federal health marketplace would not work and was not ready. Mr. Simas, who worked as one of Mr. Obama\u2019s polling data analysts during the 2012 campaign, served as the top pitchman, eagerly whipping through graphs and charts. The briefings focused largely on the Web site\u2019s appearance and ease of use, rather than the software powering the site.\n\n\u201cIn every briefing we had, the last thing that the presenters or those of who listened would have assumed was that the Web site would break down,\u201d said one Democratic member of Congress who attended several of them in the weeks leading up to the rollout.\n\nThe representative, who declined to be identified being critical of the White House, said he recalled Mr. Simas \u201ctalking exuberantly about the ease with which people could navigate the Web site\u201d and making comparisons to Travelocity.\n\n\u201cI think that they were actually caught off guard,\u201d he said, referring to the White House officials, when the Web site broke down. \u201cBarack Obama is not the I.T. director. At a certain point, you have to assume that the I.T. guys know what they were doing.\u201d\n\nOthers described the briefings in similar ways. A Democratic strategist who attended a similar event at the White House said: \u201cThey were selling people on how this is going to work. I have no reason to believe that they were not telling people what they knew.\u201d\n\nIn most cases, Mr. Simas and others conceded during the presentations that there would be \u201cglitches\u201d during the early days. But several people who attended different briefings said those admissions were expressed as minor concerns for the officials.\n\n\u201cI came away from both meetings with the sense that they felt pretty good about the rollout that was coming, but were realistic that they needed to be ready for some bumps,\u201d said the Democratic strategist, who also asked for anonymity to discuss a closed-door meeting at the White House.\n\nOne briefing was held at Third Way, the centrist Democratic research organization in Washington, for about two dozen journalists. Jim Kessler, the organization\u2019s co-founder, said Mr. Simas \u2014 whom he called \u201can honest, diligent, intellectually creative person\u201d and \u201ca real data hound\u201d \u2014 made \u201da very compelling case.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not the guy who\u2019s building the carburetor,\u201d Mr. Kessler said. \u201cHe has to trust that that carburetor\u2019s working.\u201d\n\nSome Democrats said that, given the Republican assault on the measure, the White House was right to deliver upbeat presentations promoting it.\n\n\u201cTo downplay expectations would have fed into the Republican narrative,\u201d said Jim Manley, a former top aide to Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader, who attended a session in the Roosevelt Room of the White House with other allies of the administration.\n\nBut among technology experts, the federal government\u2019s poor performance in developing Web sites was an open secret.\n\nClay Johnson, a founder of Blue State Digital, the company that ultimately developed Mr. Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign Web site, turned down a chance to work on HealthCare.gov last year, when he spent six months as a Presidential Innovation Fellow.\n\n\u201cIt was a project I wanted to steer clear of,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20131024204101, "twitter": {"description": "Before the health insurance exchange Web site went live, President Obama and other top officials confidently promoted it as being simple to use and ready for customers.", "title": "In White House Pitches, Rosy View of Health Care Site", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/25/us/politics/in-white-house-pitches-rosy-view-of-health-care-site.html?pagewanted=all", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2013/10/25/us/25pitch1/25pitch1-thumbLarge.jpg", "site": "@nytimes", "card": "summary"}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "hdl_p": "In White House Pitches, Rosy View of Health Care Site", "sectionfront_jsonp": "http://json8.nytimes.com/pages/politics/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "October 24, 2013", "edt": "NewYork", "keywords": "Computers and the Internet,Health Insurance and Managed Care,Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Obama  Barack,McDonough  Denis R,Simas  David M,CGI Group Inc,Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services,Quality Software Services Inc,HealthCare.gov", "news_keywords": "Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act", "PT": "Article", "author": "MICHAEL D.
