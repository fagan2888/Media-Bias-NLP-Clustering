Last week, the new CBS/YouGov poll found U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders with 52 percent support among Democratic primary voters in New Hampshire, while former frontrunner Hillary Clinton received 30 percent. And, in Iowa, new polling released Sept. 10 puts Sanders ahead of Clinton for the first time, marking his continued and growing popularity among voters in the lead-up to the 2016 U.S. presidential election. In both Iowa and New Hampshire, Sanders’ support is strong among independent voters and those under age 30.

But nobody explains Sanders lead over Clinton better than Stephen Colbert. He says Friday evening on the Late Show, “A funny thing happened on her way to the nomination and it’s Vermont Senator, and guy in front of you at the deli trying to return salami, Bernie Sanders.”

And in this segment on the same evening of the Late Show, Colbert talked with Sanders on why he won’t accept the terms “liberal” and “socialist” as the “insults they are meant to be.” Watch here:
