Morgan Stanley <MS.N>, Goldman Sachs Group Inc <GS.N> and Citigroup Inc <C.N> are among the banks that have received requests for information from the SEC.\n\nIt had become a common practice for investment banks to hire people with government connections. This is especially prevalent in China because of the role the ruling Communist Partyplays in the country's business.\n\nThe law enforcers are examining whether hiring practices violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, a U.S. law that bars bribes or special favors to foreign government officials in exchange for business. At issue is whether the banks hired unqualified applicants as a favor to a government official who was in a position to award them business.\n\nOne person familiar with the SEC inquiry has likened the probe to a previous investigation U.S. authorities conducted into whether oil and gas companies paid bribes to circumvent import regulations in Africa and elsewhere.\n\n(Reporting by David Henry in New York; editing by Gunna Dickson)\n\nRead the original article on Reuters.
