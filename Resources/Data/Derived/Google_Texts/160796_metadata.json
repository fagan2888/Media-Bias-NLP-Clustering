Democratic Governor Terry McAuliffe unveiled a $109 billion budget in December, the largest in Virginia\u2019s history, notes Deeds, a Democrat from Bath County.\n\nThe budget also includes Medicaid expansion, an option the Republican-controlled Senate and House of Delegates have repeatedly said is a no-go.\n\n\u201cThe biggest thing this year is this is Governor McAuliffe\u2019s first two-year budget,\u201d says House Minority Leader David Toscano. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to secure his legacy as a governor. The No. 1 lift for me is to try to protect what he has in his budget.\u201d\n\nAtypical this year: Virginia has a surplus rather than a deficit. \u201cThis is only the second time in 12 years we actually have some additional dollars to work with,\u201d says Delegate Steve Landes, a Republican representing the 25th District, which includes western Albemarle.\n\nDespite strong partisanship in the Capitol, local legislators agree there are a lot of issues that have support on both sides of the aisle.\n\nMcAuliffe has made education funding a top priority and proposes a 2 percent raise for state employees. \u201cRaises for teachers and public employees have a lot of support,\u201d says Toscano.\n\nBioscience research, development and cybersecurity funding tied to universities and community colleges \u201chave a very strong chance of passage,\u201d says Toscano. So do the job creation elements in the budget, he says.\n\nFederal sequestration in 2013 hit Virginia hard. \u201cThe days of federal government largesse are coming to an end,\u201d says Toscano. \u201cA lot of things in the budget have strong bipartisan support.\u201d\n\nLandes likes that McAuliffe put money\u2014more than $600 million\u2014into the state\u2019s rainy day fund. And he says he agrees with relaxing the accelerated sales tax for 90 percent of retailers who have had to pay it in advance.\n\nRepublican Senator Bryce Reeves, who represents eastern Albemarle in the 17th district, wants a smaller budget and state income tax cuts. \u201cThe budget seems to grow every year,\u201d he says. \u201cThe governor has put so many political things in it it\u2019s going to be a beast.\u201d\n\nWhile previous budget years have had scorched-earth debates, Landes says, \u201cI don\u2019t think it will be necessarily contentious. I think it will be an active and robust discussion. I know we\u2019ll be working with the governor and agree when we can\u2014and won\u2019t when we can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nMedicaid expansion\n\nSince he took office in 2014, Governor Terry McAuliffe has attempted to expand Medicaid for 400,000 Virginians who don\u2019t have health insurance by using federal dollars in the Affordable Care Act. Photo: John Robinson\n\nSince he took office in 2014, McAuliffe has tried to take advantage of federal dollars in the Affordable Care Act to expand Medicaid for 400,000 Virginians who don\u2019t have health insurance.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to fly,\u201d says Landes. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to back that portion out of the budget.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve repeatedly made it clear that\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d echoes Republican Delegate Rob Bell, who will be running for attorney general in 2017. \u201cThe final budget will not look like what the governor sent down.\u201d\n\nThe Dems remain hopeful but realistic. \u201cThere are a lot of moving parts,\u201d says Toscano. \u201cThe economics are such that without expansion, we\u2019re taking away millions a day, not to mention the human cost of people who can\u2019t get insurance.\u201d\n\nSays Toscano, \u201cIf anything passes, because Republicans have their feet in cement, it won\u2019t be called Medicaid expansion.\u201d\n\nDeeds points out that McAuliffe has tied expansion to some modest tax cuts as an incentive to Republicans. \u201cThe good news is we still have the option to do the right thing for 400,000 Virginians,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re the working poor and we already provide health care for them in the emergency rooms.\u201d\n\nGeoffrey Skelley with UVA\u2019s Center for Politics says any Republicans supporting Medicaid expansion would open themselves to attack in the 2017 primary. \u201cTheir opponents could suggest they\u2019re essentially going along with Obamacare.\u201d\n\nAnd if McAuliffe holds firm, it could put him in a difficult position and make it harder to get support for other projects, Skelley says. \u201cThe Republican legislature could send him a budget and if he doesn\u2019t sign it, [it could] say he\u2019s holding up the budget.\u201d\n\nGuns and legislators\n\nGun violence is another national issue that will play out in Virginia. A week before the General Assembly session started, President Barack Obama issued executive orders strengthening background checks. In October, McAuliffe banned guns in state buildings. And right before Christmas, Democratic Attorney General Mark Herring said Virginia will revoke its reciprocity agreements with other states on concealed gun permits.\n\nMeanwhile, following the San Bernardino slayings, Liberty University President Jerry Falwell Jr. encouraged students and faculty to obtain concealed carry permits.\n\nA week before the session began, there were around two dozen bills filed on guns, both tightening background checks and expanding concealed carry.\n\nToscano predicts a series of bills to loosen where guns can be carried: in schools, by teachers, in airports. \u201cI do not think any of those bills will pass,\u201d he says. And on wedge issues such as guns, says Toscano, \u201cThe governor doesn\u2019t have a lot of patience with that. And we can sustain a veto.\u201d\n\nHe adds, \u201cI don\u2019t think any gun safety bills will pass. They won\u2019t get through the House.\u201d\n\nToscano carried a bill last year that allowed private gun sellers to have voluntary background checks at gun shows done instantaneously by the Virginia State Police as it does for licensed dealers. \u201cEven that couldn\u2019t get passed,\u201d he says.\n\nLandes has heard a lot of concerns about Herring\u2019s action on concealed carry reciprocity. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to figure out what precipitated that,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a suspicion it was politically motivated. It\u2019s not coming from the state police.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ll see legislation on that,\u201d says Bell.\n\nAnd indeed, Reeves is carrying a bill to reinstitute concealed carry, and says there will be four other bills doing so.\n\nFollowing McAuliffe\u2019s executive order banning guns in state buildings and Herring\u2019s decision on concealed carry, Senator Bill Carrico threatened to defund the governor\u2019s security detail if he doesn\u2019t want guns in government buildings. \u201cThat\u2019s very much a stunt,\u201d says Skelley.\n\nBut Reeves thinks such reactions are less about guns and the Second Amendment and more about the use of executive power to bypass the legislature. \u201cI think there\u2019s going to be pushback,\u201d he says.\n\nPresidential politics\n\nAbout the same time the General Assembly will be debating the budget, the 2016 presidential primary season will be in full swing. Virginia\u2019s is March 1, and, of course, the national election is in November.\n\n\u201cVirginia is a very important swing state,\u201d says Skelley, \u201cperhaps the most watched state because of its proximity to Washington. There will be a lot of maneuvering with the presidential elections in mind.\u201d\n\nAnd Hillary Clinton, the Democratic frontrunner, is \u201cTerry McAuliffe\u2019s good friend,\u201d says Skelley.\n\nHowever, Republicans Reeves and Bell don\u2019t see the presidential race having much impact on the General Assembly. \u201cFrankly, people pay less attention to us because the presidential election is so exciting,\u201d says Bell.\n\nToscano predicts more bills to make it more difficult for people to vote. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the Republican strategy to discourage turnout of the Democratic base that doesn\u2019t vote in every election,\u201d he says.\n\nWith Herring\u2019s action on concealed carry and if McAuliffe holds fast on Medicaid, says Skelley, \u201cThese are all opportunities to make a splash politically, while not necessarily from a good government standpoint.\u201d\n\nOne thing local Dem and GOP legislators share is the desire the session not drag on.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to see us get out early,\u201d says Reeves. \u201cI think everyone\u2019s a little tired after reelection. Now it\u2019s time to get down to governing.\u201d\n\nThe bills that bind us\n\nAlong with producing a budget, Virginia legislators have been known to file thousands of bills to consider during their 60-day session. At press time, fewer than 1,400 had been filed\u2014but there were still a couple of days left to do so.\n\nWaldo Jaquith, creator of Richmond Sunlight, which tracks legislation, says he\u2019s seeing an uptick in gun bills. \u201cI guess it reflects the national debate.\u201d And he notes \u201cthe usual rate\u201d of Democrats trying to expand voting rights.\n\n\u201cWhat I haven\u2019t yet seen is the one that\u2019s going to humiliate Virginia,\u201d he says, although there\u2019s a strong contender: Delegate Dave LaRock\u2019s gender discrimination bill, which seems to target the transgender community, calls for \u201canalysis of the individual\u2019s gonadal, internal and external morphologic, chromosomal and hormonal characteristics.\u201d Explains Jaquith, \u201cIf you want to accuse someone of discrimination on the basis of sex, you\u2019ve got to prove your gender first.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s a smattering of legislation the General Assembly will be considering.\n\nPass a stopped school bus and you can get a summons in the mail. (HB243)\n\nPunching out the referee would be a Class 1 misdemeanor. (HB295)\n\nRestaurants can sell more booze with the food-alcohol ratio lowered from 45 percent food to 25 percent. (HB219)\n\nRegistered sex offenders can\u2019t have special license plates that say \u201cKids first.\u201d (HB305)\n\nTransportation of turkey toes and feathers allowed. (HB360)\n\nLegislators can still have free lunch from lobbyists. (SB213)\n\nPretending your pooch is a service dog will be a Class 4 misdemeanor. (HB270)\n\nNo tanning booths for the underage. (HB356)\n\nElectronic communications service providers can be secretly subpoenaed. (HB326)\n\nYou must be convicted of a crime before assets can be seized. (SB108)\n\nProsecutors have a duty to provide evidence to the defense. (HB246)\n\nJustifiable police homicides must be reported in the annual Crime in Virginia report. (HB301)\n\nLocalities can ban plastic bags. \u201cFirst time I\u2019ve seen it carried by a Republican,\u201d says Jaquith. (HB288)\n\nFOIA focus\n\nEvery year Virginia\u2019s Freedom of Information Act is the subject of bills that provide citizens more access to what their government is doing\u2014and bills that attempt to gut it.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a higher number of pro-access bills so far,\u201d says Megan Rhyne, executive director of the Virginia Coalition for Open Government. \u201cSeveral bring us important concepts, such as access to closed criminal investigation files.\u201d Another undoes actions taken in improperly closed meetings, she says.\n\n\u201cSo far the most troubling\u201d bill filed limits government employee salary disclosure, says Rhyne. Currently salaries under $10,000 are exempt from disclosure. SB202 would up that to $30,000, and prohibit names from being disclosed in a database, something the Cavalier Daily does annually on UVA employees. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t define database,\u201d says Rhyne. Conceivably, posting a name and salary on a blog could be illegal. \u201cIt\u2019s a very troubling law for us,\u201d she says.\n\nAlthough it may appear Hillary Clinton is the inspiration for HB398, which requires elected officials and public employees to use government e-mail accounts to conduct government business, it\u2019s been\n\na concern for years, says Rhyne. Private e-mails are \u201cnot practical from a government records standpoint,\u201d she says.\n\nLast year, Albemarle County amended the comprehensive plan for an undisclosed brewery, refusing to reveal the name of the business for which it was changing the county\u2019s land use. A couple of FOIA bills tighten up nondisclosure agreements, requiring them to be approved in an open meeting and nixing a nondisclosure exemption before a building permit or site plan can be approved.\n\nThey\u2019ve got issues\n\nPhoto: File photo\n\nCharlottesville and Albemarle have six legislators (hello, gerrymandering) headed to Richmond. The ones closest to Charlottesville talked to us about some of the bills they\u2019ll be carrying.\n\nSenator Creigh Deed s (D)\n\n25th District, Millboro\n\nBath County native Deeds, who\u2019s served in both the House of Delegates and the Senate, will be heading to the General Assembly for the 25th time.\n\nIn 2013, his son, Gus, was denied a hospital bed during a mental health crisis, attacked Deeds and then committed suicide. Needless to say, mental health care reform is a major issue for Deeds, and in November he filed a $6 million lawsuit against the state. He and Delegate Rob Bell have been working on a four-year study of the state\u2019s mental health care system, and when it\u2019s done in 2017, \u201cWe hope to make a bold initiative,\u201d says Deeds. This session, he\u2019s carrying a bill that would allow family input when faced with an emergency custody situation.\n\nRedistricting reform has been a perennial for Deeds for almost as long as he\u2019s been in the legislature. \u201cThere\u2019s no more fundamental change we can make than to reform the redistricting process with a constitutional amendment,\u201d he says.\n\nThe Atlantic Coast Pipeline has roiled Nelson County. \u201cI\u2019m not for or against the pipeline,\u201d he says, but \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s right for gas companies to go on people\u2019s property.\u201d\n\nLawyers locally have asked for another circuit court judge for the 16th Judicial Circuit, and Deeds says he\u2019s looking for a less partisan way to pick judges.\n\nDeeds is working with distillers in Nelson to \u201cput them on a more level playing field with beer and wine,\u201d he says. The loss of pollinators\u2014bees, bats and butterflies\u2014is \u201cfoundational\u201d to the economy, and he says he\u2019s working with the apiary and agricultural community to come up with a long-term approach.\n\nHe admits he used to think carrying bills for a state insect or state beverage was kind of silly, but when a group of Piedmont Virginia Community College students asked that Nelsonite become the Virginia state rock, Deeds thought, if this helps get young people interested in state government, why not?\n\nSenator Bryce Reeves (R)\n\n17th District, Spotsylvania\n\nWhat Reeves likes about the revenue surplus is that it\u2019s a chance to reduce the state income tax by returning around $135 million to taxpayers. \u201cEveryone would get about a $1,000 tax break,\u201d he says.\n\nHe\u2019s carrying a bill that would give teachers a tax credit up to $500 for the unreimbursed spending they do in the classroom.\n\nAlmost every legislator has a pet issue they keep bringing back every year, and, for Reeves, it\u2019s raising the threshold for grand larceny, which is a felony, from $200 to $500. \u201cI\u2019m a glutton for punishment,\u201d he says. He believes it hasn\u2019t gotten traction in the past because some Republicans see it as being \u201csoft on crime.\u201d But he says it would save the state more than $22 million over six years, not to mention the human cost and lives affected.\n\nHe points out that even the Koch brothers support criminal justice reform. And Reeves won\u2019t be alone. Several other bills have been filed that do the same thing.\n\nDelegate Rob Bell (R)\n\n58th District, Albemarle\n\nAfter the session, Bell, an attorney, will be making his second run for attorney general. He\u2019s been working with Deeds on the mental health commission, and has a couple of bills in mind for this year.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no required notification of family at commitment hearings,\u201d he says. And, like Deeds, he has a family input bill. \u201cNow, if a clinician decides a person shouldn\u2019t be committed, there\u2019s no recourse for family.\u201d For adults over 18, the family has both an interest and may have additional info not available to the clinician, he says.\n\nQuite often in writing legislation it\u2019s about coming up with the right language, and Bell has been working to define what constitutes stalking, including looking at a 50-state survey. The answer on when behavior becomes threatening was surprisingly simple: \u201cIf you tell them to stop,\u201d he says, comparing it to trespassing, where one has to give a warning before it\u2019s illegal to come onto private property. \u201cIt was a eureka moment,\u201d says Bell.\n\nBell\u2019s perennial since 2010 is the Tebow bill, which would allow students not enrolled in public schools to participate in sports.\n\nAnother perennial is a constitutional amendment for charter schools that would bypass localities, which now hold the authority to establish those schools. \u201cLocal input has become a local veto,\u201d he says. Constitutional amendments have to pass the General Assembly twice before they go on the ballot, and this will be the second round for Bell. \u201cI\u2019ve got a son who has needed a different approach, and lots of families have that situation,\u201d he says.\n\nDelegate Steve Landes (R)\n\n25th District, Weyers Cave\n\nTenth-termer Landes is chair of the education committee, and it\u2019s no surprise that he has ed-centric legislation. He\u2019s looking for a two-year study on the standards of quality, including what impact technology has on current standards of learning. \u201cIt\u2019s a top-to-bottom review,\u201d he says, \u201cnot piecemeal.\u201d\n\nHe also wants institutions of higher education to report to the General Assembly what activities they\u2019re involved in that affect local and regional economies. \u201cNow there\u2019s no requirement,\u201d he says. \u201cA lot of government money is going to universities. A lot of activities are going on\u201d\u2014he cites bioscience as an example\u2014\u201cwe don\u2019t always know about. This would help us make better decisions in funding.\u201d\n\nLandes is looking at economic development in agriculture, too. The Governor\u2019s Agriculture and Forestry Industries Development Fund provides $50,000 to $100,000 grants to start-ups, and Kelly free-range turkeys in Crozet received one, he says. Landes wants to expand its definition of ag activities to include aquaculture, such as oyster and trout farming.\n\nDelegate David Toscano (D)\n\n57th District, Charlottesville\n\nToscano, a family law attorney, usually carries bills pertaining to his field, and this year he\u2019s working on something called Fostering Futures. \u201cA lot of kids age out of foster care at 18 and have no plans for where they\u2019re going,\u201d he says. This measure would extend support for 18- to 21-year-olds who choose to opt in, he says.\n\nAnother bill would allow those 65 and older \u201cto vote early without an excuse,\u201d says Toscano. Currently to get an absentee ballot in Virginia, one must have an approved reason for not showing up at the polls. \u201cLet\u2019s make it easier for anyone over 65 to vote,\u201d he urges.\n\nA couple of Toscano bills deal with energy. One would allow localities to give homeowners loans for installing solar energy that would be paid back in property tax bills. Another lets electric car owners send energy back to the grid when the vehicle isn\u2019t in use.\n\nAnd Toscano wants to give students for whom English is a second language a break and not have to immediately pass SOLs. \u201cThey may be perfectly smart but don\u2019t know English well,\u201d he says.\n\nDelegate Matt Fariss (R)\n\n59th District, Rustburg\n\nFariss, who runs a livestock auction in Lynchburg and lives 70 miles from some of his southern Albemarle constituents, can be difficult to catch up with, although he told C-VILLE a couple of years ago he does meet with those he represents\u2014in Lovingston. This year was no exception, and the delegate from Rustburg did not respond to multiple requests from C-VILLE, although an aide did e-mail two bills he\u2019d be carrying.\n\nOne allows property owners to sue those who fly picture-taking drones over their property. Another requires animal control officers and humane investigators to include a description of their animal intake policy in annual reports to the state veterinarian.\n\n\u201cI think it will be an active and robust discussion,\u201d says Republican Delegate Steve Landes. \u201cI know we\u2019ll be working with the governor and agree when we can\u2014and won\u2019t when we can\u2019t.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "David Toscano says gun safety bills are likely to be stalled in the House of Delegates.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "C-VILLE Weekly", "description": "David Toscano says gun safety bills are likely to be stalled in the House of Delegates.", "title": "Put on ice: The General Assembly is in session", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.c-ville.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IceGun.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-01-12T14:18:58+00:00", "url": "http://www.c-ville.com/put-ice-general-assembly-session/", "type": "article"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"admins": 1219058141, "app_id": 1073603839361926}, "template": "Cville Theme 3.0.0", "article": {"section": "News", "tag": "Government & Courts", "published_time": "2016-01-13T07:00:46+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-12T14:18:58+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "A week before the General Assembly session started, President Barack Obama issued executive orders strengthening background checks.\nA couple of Toscano bills deal with energy.\nPresidential politicsAbout the same time the General Assembly will be debating the budget, the 2016 presidential primary season will be in full swing.\nHowever, Republicans Reeves and Bell don\u2019t see the presidential race having much impact on the General Assembly.\nRepublican Senator Bryce Reeves, who represents eastern Albemarle in the 17th district, wants a smaller budget and state income tax cuts."}
