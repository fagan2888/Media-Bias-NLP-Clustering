CHARLESTON, W.Va. — State Attorney General Patrick Morrisey may be seeking another title in 2016.

“Yes, I am considering that option in addition to a number of others,” Morrisey said on Thursday’s MetroNews “Talkline” when asked if he’s weighing a run for governor.

“I will note that it’s still early in the process,” Morrisey, a Republican, said before talking about steps he’s already taking to prepare for some kind of statewide run.

“We have begun to develop an infrastructure that would allow me either to run for reelection or for another office. We’re starting the process. We opened a committee. We’re beginning to raise money and starting to think through the mechanics to run a successful campaign,” he said.

“Running a statewide campaign in West Virginia takes a lot of work and you have to make sure you can raise the resources to communicate your message to voters.”

Morrisey was first elected AG in 2012 after beating incumbent AG Darrell McGraw who’d served since 1992. He’s the first Republican AG in West Virginia since 1933.

During his time in office, he’s taken a strong stand against regulations from the Environmental Protection Agency along with provisions in the Affordable Care Act and been an advocate for 2nd Amendment rights.

“If people believe that I could contribute more to the state in a different position, then I would consider that position,” Morrisey said of any possible run for the Republican gubernatorial nomination next year.

If he gets into the race, he could be one of several GOP candidates.

Earlier this month, 1st District Congressman David McKinley (R-W.Va.) told Hoppy Kercheval on MetroNews “Talkline” he was “seriously considering” seeking the nomination.
