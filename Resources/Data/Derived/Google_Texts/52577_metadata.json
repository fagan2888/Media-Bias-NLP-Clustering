While some observers project that up to two-thirds of the country could be covered by ACOs in the next five years, all agree the success of ACOs \u2014 on the exchange and elsewhere \u2014 will depend on their ability to bend the cost curve and not just improve quality.\n\nWellPoint, Inc. unit Anthem Blue Cross in California and Cigna Corp. last month reported improved quality results through their ACOs, and Cigna also reported a lower medical cost trend.\n\nAmong the results, Anthem said its ACO partners in 2012 had a 35% increase in the number of mammograms performed and a 44% increase in the appropriate prescribing of antibiotics for bronchitis treatment. Cigna\u2019s results for its Granite Healthcare Network ACO in New Hampshire included an 8% reduction in the emergency room cost trend, a 4% reduction in the use of the ER, a 4% reduction in the advanced imagining cost trend and a 7% reduction in the use of advanced imaging.\n\nCigna, like other insurers, is bullish on the model, which it calls \u201ccollaborative accountable care.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have grown from one in 2008 to 86 arrangements now, and we expect to get to 100 sometime early in 2014,\u201d says Cigna Medical Director Dick Salmon, M.D. \u201cThose 100 arrangements will cover about 10% of our customers.\u201d\n\nSalmon says growth in ACOs has been stoked by the Medicare Shared Savings Program and the ACO Pioneer program, which were created under the 2010 Affordable Care Act (ACA). Since passage of the ACA, more than 360 provider groups have created Medicare ACOs, which now cover more than 5.3 million Medicare beneficiaries, CMS said last month. These ACOs share with Medicare any savings generated from lowering the cost growth when they meet certain quality standards of the entire population.\n\n\u201cThat has been a major stimulus for more and more health care professional organizations to really strive to have the capabilities to be accountable for their population based care,\u201d Salmon tells HRW. \u201cThe fact that Medicare is stimulating this has really helped to accelerate our growth as well\u201d in the private sector.\n\nACOs: A Model for the Exchange?\n\nWhether ACOs are a good fit for insurance exchanges depends on how they\u2019re defined, Salmon says. CMS defines an ACO as a group of doctors, hospitals or other health care professionals who have come together voluntarily to provide coordinated, high-quality care, he notes. Salmon says this means an ACO is a portion of a network.\n\n\u201cSo if you\u2019re asking, is an ACO appropriate to be a part of a network that\u2019s offered by a plan on a health exchange? Absolutely,\u201d he adds. \u201cIs it appropriate that it be the principal part of a network offered by a plan on a health exchange? Absolutely. That is because ACOs are typically a geographically aligned group of health care professionals.\u201d\n\nBut he adds that any plan offered on an exchange will have to have a complementary network to deal with out-of-area care. \u201cSo in and of itself, an [ACO] is probably not sufficient,\u201d he says as a free-standing option on the exchange.\n\nDavid Muhlestein, Ph.D., director of research at consulting firm Leavitt Partners, LLC, says his organization heard from many ACOs expressing interest in participating on the exchange.\n\n\u201cBut we\u2019ve seen just a few examples of where they\u2019re actually offering them,\u201d he tells HRW. These include Aurora Health Care in Wisconsin, and a joint venture between Sentara Healthcare in Virginia and Mountain States Health Alliance in Tennessee.\n\nThey\u2019re doing it in two ways. In one, they\u2019ll actually create an insurance company and register with a department of insurance in a state, Muhlestein says. \u201cBut the more common way that we\u2019ve seen \u2014 and expect going forward \u2014 is to partner with a plan with a very narrow network offering,\u201d he adds. \u201cSo it will be within the ACO, but it could be Aetna or United that is offering the plan.\u201d\n\nThis sentiment is echoed by Rich Lipeles, chief operating officer of Heritage Provider Network, which runs the nation\u2019s largest Medicare Pioneer ACO. Lipeles said he doesn\u2019t expect provider groups to leap into the exchanges. \u201cMany providers have gotten into [Medicare ACOs] from a defensive posture \u2014 they didn\u2019t want to miss the boat,\u201d Lipeles told attendees at the National Accountable Care Congress in Los Angeles, sponsored by Global Health Care, LLC, this past fall. \u201cWe are going to be cautious,\u201d Lipeles said, according to a January article in HRW sister publication ACO Business News.\n\nACOs Could Take Off Nationwide\n\nMeanwhile, ACOs outside of the exchange are poised to take off, in part due to the 2010 health reforms, say insurance executives and observers.\n\nMark Bertolini, president and CEO of Aetna Inc., told financial analysts last month that the insurer had 30 ACOs at the end of 2013 and will have 60 by the end of 2014. \u201cWe have 550,000 members running through our ACO agreements now. That will grow to 850,000 next year [i.e., 2014],\u201d he said.\n\nThe seeds for the most advanced ACOs were planted prior to the ACA, says Muhlestein.\n\n\u201cThe ACA kind of acted as a billows that came out to that little flame that was there and really gave it some life,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was a process that was already in place, but this accelerated it.\u201d\n\nAmong other things, providers reacted to the Medicare Shared Savings Plan activity, he says.\n\n\u201cIf there is one hospital in a city that becomes a Medicare Shared Savings ACO, their competitors view it as a competitive disadvantage not to also move down that path,\u201d Muhlestein says. \u201cSo they\u2019ll start to form Medicare and also private ACOs. It acts as a seed in some markets to create lots of activity and it enables those smaller organizations to participate.\u201d\n\nACOs Could Cover Two-Thirds of Country\n\nMuhlestein says under a best-case scenario, roughly two-thirds of the country would be covered by ACOs in the next five years. \u201cA more realistic number would be putting it close to the 35% range,\u201d he adds.\n\nHe also notes that it\u2019s still early to declare success just yet. Even the results of CMS\u2019s Pioneer ACOs, released last summer, showed a mixed picture. Of the 32 Pioneers, 13 generated savings to qualify for bonuses totaling $76 million; two shared losses totaling $4 million; and nine dropped out of the Pioneer program (HRW 8/5/13, p. 4).\n\n\u201cIt was pretty consistently positive on the quality side,\u201d Muhlestein says. \u201cBut the quality component is not what is going to be driving this. What is going to be driving this is the cost side. I would say it was generally positive, but nothing that is going to make someone jump into it right away.\u201d\n\nOne metric to gauge the success of ACOs going forward, particularly on the commercial side, will be to see how many renew their contracts, Muhlestein says. \u201cIf they leave their contract, it\u2019s a big indication they were not successful in saving money.\u201d\n\nCigna\u2019s Salmon says the ACO model has the potential to be a game changer.\n\n\u201cThe momentum and acceleration feels terrific,\u201d he says. \u201cThose of us who really believe this is the key to transforming our health care system \u2014 and evolving towards a quality, affordable health care system \u2014 certainly hope this will continue to grow over the next three to five years, and we become a major way that care is delivered in the United States. We\u2019re optimistic, but I think it\u2019s still early.\u201d\n\n\u00a9 2014 by Atlantic Information Services, Inc.
