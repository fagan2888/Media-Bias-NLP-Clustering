Dannel P. Malloy\u2019s budget originally proposed cutting Medicaid coverage for about 34,000 parents, but the version approved by the Legislature last week trimmed that figure to 23,700.\n\nTechnically, the change was made by lowering the income limit for Medicaid eligibility from 201 percent of the poverty level to 155 percent, effective Aug. 1.\n\nThe majority of affected parents have earned income from paid employment, and under federal rules are therefore able to continue with Medicaid for a transitional year after that cutoff date. But those who have only unearned income, such as Social Security and unemployment, enjoy no such protection.\n\nState officials have argued that parents in both groups will be able to buy health insurance through the state\u2019s exchange, Access Health CT, at prices subsidized by the federal government under the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cWe have the best health-insurance exchange in the nation \u2014 so good that states across the U.S. are modeling theirs after Connecticut\u2019s,\u201d said Devon Puglia, spokesman for the governor.\n\n\u201cWe are also proud to say that we are the only state \u2014 the only state \u2014 that subsidizes Medicaid to the levels we currently do,\u201d Puglia said in a statement.\n\nBut critics predict thousands won\u2019t buy insurance from the exchange because of the cost of premiums and out-of-pocket expenses.\n\n\u201cThe reality is they are just not likely to buy a supplemental health insurance plan or pay out of pocket,\u201d Krause said.\n\nIt would cost someone about $1,900 each year to buy a medical policy, according to a March report commissioned by the health foundation, which was released about a month after the governor proposed the 2016-17 budget.\n\nThe possibility of losing Medicaid was frightening to Julieta Flores-Bravo, of Bridgeport.\n\nThrough a translator, Flores-Bravo, 43, said she has asthma, high blood pressure, diabetes and anemia. She and her husband have a combined income of $39,000, which must provide for their 9-year-old son and 21-year-old daughter, who live with them. She said they wouldn\u2019t be able to afford private health insurance through the exchange.\n\nBecause of situations like Flores-Bravo\u2019s, health care advocates know they need to work with state and community agencies to make sure people get the information they need to stay insured.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to take a concerted, collaborative effort to make sure they don\u2019t fall through the cracks and that they stay covered,\u201d Krause said.\n\nShe said the health foundation is calling on state agencies and nonprofit groups to create a multifaceted plan that addresses different insurance options.\n\nSharon Langer, advocacy director at Connecticut Voices for Children, said these groups will have their work cut out for them, given what has happened in other states that rolled back their Medicaid coverage.\n\nFor example, four months after Rhode Island tightened eligibility requirements in 2013, 11 percent of former recipients had enrolled in the state\u2019s exchange, but 30 percent were left uninsured.\n\nLanger said she worries children would lose coverage \u2014 a concern echoed by the health foundation.\n\nIn 2013, Maine reduced the income eligibility standard for parents.", "article_metadata": {"SKYPE_TOOLBAR": "SKYPE_TOOLBAR_PARSER_COMPATIBLE", "description": "\u201cThe final decision to roll back eligibility certainly takes us back a step,\u201d said Elizabeth Krause, vice president of policy and communications at the Connecticut Health Foundation.
