CC BY-NC-ND 2.0\n\nModern medicine in the Western world relies primarily on treating existing illnesses with drugs or unnecessary procedures and a quick turnaround in the doctor\u2019s office in order to treat more people. In the midst of all this hectic chaos, doctors will skim over a patient\u2019s record and medical history, get a mere glimpse into their emotional lives, and leave mental health care to the side.\n\nBut Dr. Ronald Epstein, a University of Rochester professor, wants to change the way doctors approach their patients. Suffering is seen in all corners of hospitals and medical centers \u2014 from the emotional pain of a mother who just lost an unborn baby to an older man facing a terminal illness, yet doctors often don\u2019t address it.\n\nIn a new essay published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, Epstein and a co-author, oncologist Anthony Back of the University of Washington, reviewed medical literature on the ways doctors approach suffering. They found that an approach to suffering is rarely discussed in the medical world, and that this needs to change.\n\n\u201cPhysicians can have a pivotal role in addressing suffering if they can expand how they work with patients,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cSome people can do this instinctively, but most physicians need training in how to respond to suffering \u2014 yet this kind of instruction is painfully lacking.\u201d\n\nEpstein and Back note that physicians can improve their approach by listening to the patient and learning about his/her experience. In addition to the typical \u201cdiagnosing and treating,\u201d the authors argue that doctors should also \u201cturn toward\u201d the patient, and recognize their suffering. They can do that by asking questions like, \u201cWhat\u2019s the worst part of this for you?\u201d Sometimes an acknowledgment that their pain is real, and that it matters to someone, is all a patient needs to open up.\n\nNext, the authors note that doctors can \u201crefocus and reclaim,\u201d to help steer patients towards what\u2019s most meaningful in their lives. This is especially important in cases where drugs and treatments often can\u2019t cure the root of suffering, such as in chronic illnesses. Healing often occurs when the physician approaches the patient as a whole \u2014 as a human with emotions and a mind rather than just a body needing to be treated \u2014 and that is the entire notion behind holistic medicine.\n\nEpstein has been a proponent of mindful and holistic medicine for years, and his work is one of the most widely cited in medical literature in the U.S. One of his most famous papers from 2002 explains the need for the scientific community to redefine \u201cprofessional competence\u201d among doctors, and to expand basic core knowledge of medicine, reasoning, judgment, management of ambiguity, professionalism, time-management, and communication skills.\n\nAsking doctors to approach patients as whole people \u201cis a tall order,\u201d Epstein wrote, \u201cyet, it strikes us as more feasible than ever because of evidence that programs promoting mindfulness, emotional intelligence, and self-regulation makes a difference.\u201d\n\nSource: Epstein R, Back A.
