Pat Toomey believes the Affordable Care Act is in its final days.\n\nSpeaking to \"The Cat's Roundtable\" on New York\u2019s AM-970 radio station in an interview that aired Sunday, Toomey said the healthcare legislation was in a \"death-spiral\" that he and his GOP colleagues predicted.\n\nHe claimed the people who were supposed to be signing up under the law weren't doing so, driving up the cost of premiums and hurting those who were meant to sign up - the young and healthy. Here's a transcript of his comments, via The Hill:\n\n\u201cEspecially given a hospital has to treat someone who shows up and you can buy health insurance even if you already have an existing condition, these people are not in fact signing up and paying the premiums,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAnd so, the people who are participating are the older and sicker people, that\u2019s driving people up, that causes a further exodus of younger, healthy people,\u201d he added.\n\nThe senator also noted about half of the state-based healthcare co-ops set up under the law have failed. He called for repealing the bill in the interview.\n\nThe legislation passed in 2009 with a Democrat-controlled House and Senate before Toomey took office in 2011.\n\nEarlier in December, Toomey, along with other Republicans, passed legislation in the Senate that would reverse many key provisions of the law. President Barack Obama is expected to veto it.\n\nThat legislation and his comments come on the heels of the Tuesday deadline for people to sign up for health insurance under Obamacare if they want their coverage to begin Jan. 1.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/static/global/config/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Pa.
