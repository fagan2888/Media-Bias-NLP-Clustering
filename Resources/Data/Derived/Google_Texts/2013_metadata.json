In this industry, that\u2019s what we live on. If I had to wait two weeks I don\u2019t know how I\u2019d survive.\u201d\n\nThe new rule comes on the heels of the Obama White House\u2019s oft repeated call for Congress to increase the higher federal minimum wage rate from $7.25 to $9 an hour.\n\n\u2013\n\nFollow Becket Adams (@BecketAdams) on Twitter\n\nFeatured image Getty Images.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "The Internal Revenue Service in 2014 will enforce a new rule that will require restaurants to recognize automatic gratuities added to large parties as taxable wages and not as tips.
