It appears she believes it\u2019s time to go to another network. Patti Stanger has announced that she won\u2019t be bringing her Millionaire Matchmaker show back to Bravo for an eighth season, but it seems as if the program will be living on in some form on another channel.\n\nPatti Stanger took to Twitter to make the announcement, and she was less than subtle about the fact that this is the end of Millionaire Matchmaker on Bravo but not the end of the show centered on her dating agency entirely.\n\nAfter 8 seasons I\u2019ve decided to leave @Bravotv Thank u 4 the great ride. Stay tuned for exciting news as I move to a wonderful new network! \u2014 Patti Stanger (@pattistanger) July 10, 2015\n\nIt seems as if the split between Patti Stanger and Bravo was pretty amicable, considering the network issued a goodbye note, according to Entertainment Weekly.\n\n\u201cWe loved watching Patti Stanger find love for so many people over the last 8 seasons on Bravo,\u201d said a Bravo spokesperson. \u201cWe wish her the best with her new endeavors.\u201d\n\nThere isn\u2019t any immediate news on whether or not Millionaire Matchmaker will take on a new look on this new network, or whether Patti Stanger is going to go in a new direction. Certainly playing matchmaker for millionaires is how Patti Stanger made her name and made her money.\n\nIt\u2019s also clear she loved to give advice to the people she matched up. You have to wonder if maybe the Millionaire Matchmaker might be looking to have more of a dating advice show. Whatever move she makes, it\u2019s pretty obvious she has a client base that isn\u2019t going anywhere. She\u2019s hooked up some pretty top notch celebrities, including the likes of Perez Hilton. She\u2019s had success in Millionaire Matchmaker even if her own personal life has had some bumps in the road. It wasn\u2019t that long ago the television personality split from her own longtime boyfriend.\n\n\u201cBefore you hear it from anyone else, i wanted to let you know myself \u2014 David and I broke up,\u201d she wrote in June. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate for a million and one reasons and obviously hard and sad for both of us.\u201d\n\nFor now, we\u2019ll just have to wonder where Patti Stanger is taking her Millionaire Matchmaker talents and what she\u2019s going to do with them.\n\n[Photo by Michael Buckner/Getty Images for FIJI]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Patti Stanger became famous for being the Millionaire Matchmaker on Bravo.
