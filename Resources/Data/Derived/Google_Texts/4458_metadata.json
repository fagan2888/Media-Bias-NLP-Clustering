He was 78.\n\nDays of mourning culminated with the funeral. Catholic parishioners who were able to secure tickets from their parishes lined up at 9 a.m. to get seats at the standing-room-only funeral.\n\nNotable names came a bit later. They included Gov. Bruce Rauner, Mayor Rahm Emanuel and his wife, Amy Rule, Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle, Chicago Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy, Ald. Ed Burke, and Cook County Commissioners John Daley and Bridget Gainer. There were numerous nonprofit and business leaders, including Big Shoulders Fund CEO Josh Hale; Sister Rosemary Connelly of Misericordia; Thomas Grusecki, president and CEO of Northern Builders; Richard Driehaus, founder and chairman of Chicago-based Driehaus Capital Management; Wintrust CEO Ed Wehmer; and William Blair's James O'Connor.\n\nThe traditional Catholic funeral Mass included a homily by Seattle Archbishop Peter Sartain, who considered George a friend and mentor. Sartain was bishop of the Joliet diocese from 2006 to 2010.\n\nGeorge \u201clived a life of faith, hope, conviction and courage,\u201d said Sartain, who recalled George's \u201cbrilliant mind\u201d and \u201cdevotion to prayer.\u201d\n\nNumerous leaders of other faiths stood at the altar during the noontime service.\n\nAppointed to Chicago in 1997 by Pope John Paul II, George was a leader within the church and a Catholic spokesman for issues outside the church. He fought against Obamacare and led a group of U.S. bishops to persuade the Vatican to address the issue of priests accused of sex abuse.\n\nCupich spoke briefly at the end of the Mass, thanking the many volunteers who helped prepare for the funeral and all the accompanying services that drew thousands from \u201call ethnicities, religions and walks of life.\u201d He also thanked the mayor for his support and spoke to George's family, saying, \u201cThank you for the influence you've had on his life and your support as it enhanced his passion.\"\n\nSome more scenes from inside the cathedral earlier:\n\n400 priests, 30 bishops and 9 cardinals have gathered for Cardinal George's funeral. pic.twitter.com/0TNUZ7vZIn \u2014 Shia Kapos (@ShiaKapos) April 23, 2015", "article_metadata": {"byline": "Shia Kapos", "timeCrawled": "20160525_07:07:01", "categoryName": "Blogs - Takes Names", "published_at": "2015-4-23", "title": "Cardinal George remembered for 'faith, hope, conviction and courage'", "url": "http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article//BLOGS03/150429925", "twitter": {"image": "http://www.chicagobusiness.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CG/20150423/BLOGS03/150429925/AR/0/AR-150429925.jpg&maxw=400", "site": "@CrainsChicago", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Cardinal George remembered for 'faith, hope, conviction and courage'"}, "taxo_People": "Cardinal Francis E.
