The company said it has set a goal that by the third quarter, its technicians will no longer show up late to customers\u2019 homes.\n\nComcast has worked hard to transform its low-rated customer experience after some embarrassing episodes of poor customer interactions went viral around the Internet in recent months. Last year, the company tapped a product executive, Charlie Herrin, to spearhead a move to \u201cproductize\u201d the customer experience.\n\n\u201cIt is unacceptable some of the individual instances that have been well-documented,\u201d Comcast Chief Executive Brian Roberts said. \u201cIt was a rallying cry inside the company.\u201d\n\nComcast said it has budgeted more than $300 million for its new customer-service efforts, which come on the heels of the collapse of the company\u2019s plans to buy Time Warner Cable Inc. for $45 billion.\n\nAmong Comcast\u2019s new initiatives: allowing customers to follow technicians on an Uber-like app that will show them where en route their technician is. The app also allows customers to rate each technician\u2019s service call. The company said the app will be rolled out in all of its service areas by the end of the year. It also is releasing an app that will remotely diagnose problems with your set-top box.\n\nMr. Smit said Comcast is going to hire hundreds of new technicians and 5,500 new customer representatives to staff new call centers over the next couple of years.\n\n\u201cWe need to win back their loyalty,\u201d Mr. Smit said. \u201cPerceptions are lasting and we have to take every opportunity and every point of contact with the customer to get it right.\u201d\n\nThe company showcased its latest technology at a new retail store in Chicago that evokes the feel of an Apple store or Google Fiber space\u2014with large screens and gadgets for people to test.\n\nComcast executives said they are transforming about 100 of their 500 retail stores into such studio spaces that will hold community events and allow customers to come and try out Comcast products.\n\nComcast has previously talked about how it wants to better its customer experience. On the company\u2019s earnings call with analysts on Monday, Mr. Roberts said the company was moving on from its failed deal with Time Warner Cable and focusing on operating and growing its core business, including transforming customer service.\n\nMr. Roberts indicated that customers\u2019 expectations are rising thanks to the Web-like efficiency of apps like Uber, and that\u2019s pushing Comcast to hasten its pace.\n\n\u201cPart of this is the world is giving us the chance to accelerate because of the technology,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Comcast is going to pay you $20 if its technicians are even just one minute late to your home for a service call.It's part of the cable company's broader effort to improve its low-rated customer service.
