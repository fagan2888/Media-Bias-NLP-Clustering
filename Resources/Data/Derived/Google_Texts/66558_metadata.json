The president\u2019s official account \u2013 run by Organizing for America \u2013 had four tweets: two were encouraging people to sign up for Obamacare over Christmas and New Year\u2019s, and two tweets were promoting Obama\u2019s weekly address \u2013 and not one mention of Pearl Harbor.\n\nThere were also no references to Pearl Harbor on the White House\u2019s official Twitter account Saturday; all of those posts were focused on the message from the president\u2019s weekly address.\n\nIn contrast, and as one tipster pointed out, following the death of former South African leader Nelson Mandela on Thursday, the president\u2019s individual account featured a few quotes from Obama\u2019s address on Mandela, sandwiched between more plugs for Obamacare enrollment.\n\nNow, it\u2019s obvious that the death of a world leader deserves mention. But when such mentions outweigh mentions of a historic anniversary, some of you were wondering if that\u2019s just a little odd.\n\nThe White House Twitter account posted multiple tweets about Mandela\u2019s death and Obama\u2019s statement about his passing, as well as a tweet from the first lady. Here\u2019s a sample of a few:\n\nBetween the White House\u2019s, the president\u2019s and the first lady\u2019s accounts on Dec. 5, there were 20 mentions of Nelson Mandela\u2019s death posted on social media by the administration.\n\nWhile the president and the White House did not use Twitter to address the anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor, the White House on Thursday did issue a presidential proclamation marking Saturday, \u201cNational Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day.\u201d\n\nThe White House did not comment to TheBlaze about the decision to leave Pearl Harbor off its Twitter account Saturday.\n\n\u2013\n\nFollow Mike Opelka on Twitter \u2013 @stuntbrain", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "gplus-count": 7, "twitter": {"description": "Over the weekend, TheBlaze received a few tips from readers that the White House and President Barack Obama's Twitter accounts completely skipped any mention of the 72nd anniversary of Japan's deadly attack on the U.S. at Pearl Harbor.
