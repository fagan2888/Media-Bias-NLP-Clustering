In that same period, the entire milk category grew by just 1.8 percent, to $24.5 billion, according to Mintel. Nondairy milk\u2019s growth is expected to continue outpacing dairy milk\u2019s at least through 2018.\n\nPlant-based alternatives can be a saving grace for people with food allergies or lactose intolerance, or those who follow vegan diets. (An estimated 12 percent of Americans suffer from lactose intolerance, according to the National Institutes of Health.) Probably the more powerful factor driving the popularity of milk substitutes is a consumer group that Sandy Krueger of IRI Worldwide, a Chicago-based market research firm, calls the \u201chealthy chic\u201d \u2014 people who look at labels and are drawn to products that promise to improve health and wellness.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a sort of health halo\u201d to plant-based milks, Krueger says. \u201cThere\u2019s a general perception that they\u2019re healthier than cow\u2019s milk, and taste better.\u201d\n\nCHOICES, CHOICES\n\nWith the proliferation of new flavors and varieties \u2014 52 new milk-substitute products have been rolled out so far in 2014 \u2014 the growth is sure to continue, she says.\n\nThe nutrition profile of each milk substitute varies widely, so different products appeal to people with different health priorities, says Jessica Crandall, a registered dietitian and spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.\n\nPeople counting calories might reach for almond milk, which has less than half the calories of skim milk, and no sugar. Those who want to boost protein intake may choose soy milk, which has eight grams of protein per serving, as much as cow\u2019s milk.\n\nSome drink kefir \u2014 a fermented, fortified dairy drink \u2014 because it contains probiotics, which help digestion and defend against gastrointestinal distress.\n\nHemp milk, made from the hemp seed, can be a good option for kids with food allergies who need a source of calcium or protein, Crandall says. It also has essential fatty acids such as omega-3 and omega- 6, which help build healthy cells and reduce risk of heart disease.\n\nBut just because a milk is plant-based doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s healthful.\n\nWhile many plant-based milks are fortified, some don\u2019t contain as much calcium or vitamin D as cow\u2019s milk, which is important in preventing osteoporosis. Crandall says you can supplement with such foods as kale, chia seeds, edamame and sardines, which are packed with calcium and vitamin D.\n\nStick with pasteurized, unsweetened varieties of milk alternatives, Crandall says. One cup of Almond Breeze chocolate milk, for instance, has 20 grams of sugar, as much as there is in a Cadbury Creme Egg.\n\nThe Center for Science in the Public Interest, a nonprofit food safety advocacy group, cautions consumers to read labels closely and beware of milk substitutes that ride the health benefits of the plant they\u2019re derived from even if the milk isn\u2019t as nutritious as the whole food.\n\nFor instance, while an ounce of almonds has about six grams of protein, almond milk has only one gram per one-cup serving.\n\nIn the kitchen, each milk substitute is suited for different uses.\n\nHemp milk, for instance, is a good choice for cappuccinos and lattes because it froths better than other plant-based varieties, says Megan Roosevelt a registered dietitian in Portland, Ore., who runs Healthy Grocery Girl, a Web site that offers advice on food shopping and healthy living.\n\nBecause of its thick, creamy consistency, soy milk is ideal in smoothies and for cooking and baking.\n\nAlmond milk, milder in flavor and thinner in texture, tastes good in coffee, tea, smoothies or on its own.\n\nRice milk has the thinnest consistency of all nondairy milks and can be a good accompaniment for cereal or smoothies.\n\nTHE CASE FOR DAIRY\n\nThe proliferation of milk substitutes hasn\u2019t gone unnoticed by the marketers of cow\u2019s milk. A variety of dairy-milk products with added protein and probiotics have recently hit store shelves. In February, the dairy-milk processors rolled out a $50 million ad campaign that promotes milk\u2019s high protein content.\n\nCalcium has been milk\u2019s traditional nutritional advantage over other beverages. But by focusing on protein and all of its implicit benefits \u2014 protein increases satiety, assists in weight management and builds muscle mass \u2014 dairy-milk producers have seized on a way to stay culturally relevant for parents, aging boomers and seniors.\n\nThe so-called Milk Life campaign replaces the \u201cGot Milk?\u201d campaign, which began in 1995. New commercials feature kids, teens and adults drinking milk to power everything from break dancing to dog walking.\n\n\u201cThis is what eight grams of protein can do,\u201d the ads proclaim.\n\nIn consumer research, the message about milk\u2019s high-protein content was the one most likely to win over consumers now drinking juice, water or soda, says Victor Zaborsky, marketing director for the Milk Processor Education Association, which represents 200 dairy-milk companies.\n\n\u201cIt really emphasized the benefits that dairy milk had over alternative beverages,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cTraditionally, milk has been an unconscious choice, just something you put in your coffee or cereal,\u201d Zaborsky says. \u201cNow we\u2019re trying to shift it so that dairy milk is a conscious choice consumers routinely make to improve their quality of life for the long term.\u201d\n\nREADING THE LABELS\n\n\u25a0 Whole dairy milk: Calories, 149; fat, 8 grams; protein, 8 grams; sugar, 12 grams; calcium, 27.6 percent of RDA; vitamin D, 20.6 percent of RDA; other benefits: folate, niacin, riboflavin, thiamin and vitamins B6, A and E.\n\n\u25a0 2 percent dairy milk: Calories, 122; fat, 5 grams; protein, 8 grams; sugar, 12 grams; calcium, 29.3 percent of RDA; vitamin D, 20 percent of RDA; other benefits: iron, magnesium, potassium, zinc, vitamin B6.\n\n\u25a0 Skim dairy milk: Calories, 83; fat, 0 grams; protein, 8 grams; sugar, 12 grams; calcium, 29.9 percent of RDA; vitamin D, 19.2 percent of RDA; other benefits: iron, magnesium, potassium, zinc, vitamin B6.\n\n\u25a0 Soy (Silk original soy milk): Calories, 110; fat, 4.5 grams; protein, 8 grams; sugar, 6 grams; calcium, 45 percent of RDA; vitamin D, 30 percent of RDA; other benefits: vitamin B12, magnesium, phosphorus.\n\n\u25a0 Almond (Almond Breeze original unsweetened): Calories, 30; fat, 2.5 grams; protein, 1 gram; sugar, 0 grams; calcium, 45 percent of RDA; vitamin D, 25 percent of RDA; other benefits: vitamin E, magnesium.\n\n\u25a0 Rice (Rice Dream enriched unsweetened original): Calories, 120; fat, 2.5 grams; protein, 1 gram; sugar, 10 grams; calcium, 30 percent of RDA; vitamin D, 25 percent of RDA; other benefits: vitamins B12 and A, phosphorus.\n\n\u25a0 Coconut (So Delicious): Calories, 70; fat, 4.5 grams; protein, 0 grams; sugar, 7 grams; calcium, 10 percent of RDA; vitamin D, 30 percent of RDA; other benefits: magnesium, vitamins B12 and A, medium-chain fatty acids.\n\n\u25a0 Hemp (Pacific Foods): Calories, 70; fat, 3 grams; protein, 5 grams; sugar, 0 grams; calcium, 30 percent of RDA; vitamin D, 30 percent of RDA; other benefits: vitamins A, B12 and E, phosphorus, magnesium, riboflavin.\n\n\u25a0 Kefir (Nancy\u2019s organic lowfat plain): Calories, 140; fat, 3 grams; protein, 11 grams; sugar, 16 grams; calcium, 40 percent of RDA; vitamin D, 0 percent of RDA; other benefits: probiotics.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2014/07/hfcov0722.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc95db\"", "article_summary": "\u25a0 Almond (Almond Breeze original unsweetened): Calories, 30; fat, 2.5 grams; protein, 1 gram; sugar, 0 grams; calcium, 45 percent of RDA; vitamin D, 25 percent of RDA; other benefits: vitamin E, magnesium.\n\u25a0 Soy (Silk original soy milk): Calories, 110; fat, 4.5 grams; protein, 8 grams; sugar, 6 grams; calcium, 45 percent of RDA; vitamin D, 30 percent of RDA; other benefits: vitamin B12, magnesium, phosphorus.\nPeople counting calories might reach for almond milk, which has less than half the calories of skim milk, and no sugar.\n\u25a0 Kefir (Nancy\u2019s organic lowfat plain): Calories, 140; fat, 3 grams; protein, 11 grams; sugar, 16 grams; calcium, 40 percent of RDA; vitamin D, 0 percent of RDA; other benefits: probiotics.\n\u25a0 Rice (Rice Dream enriched unsweetened original): Calories, 120; fat, 2.5 grams; protein, 1 gram; sugar, 10 grams; calcium, 30 percent of RDA; vitamin D, 25 percent of RDA; other benefits: vitamins B12 and A, phosphorus."}
