Earlier today, President Obama issued a statement and answered questions asked by the press in the Brady Briefing Room. The President explained the need for Congress to reopen the government and prevent a default that would cause an economic shutdown. And he reiterated that while he is willing to negotiate on the budget or matters of policy like Obamacare, he will not allow members of the House of Representatives to hold the economy hostage. He stated:

"This morning, I had a chance to speak with Speaker Boehner, and I told him what I've been saying publicly, that I am happy to talk with him and other Republicans about anything — not just issues I think are important, but also issues that they think are important. But I also told him that having such a conversation, talks, negotiations, shouldn’t require hanging the threats of a government shutdown or economic chaos over the heads of the American people."
