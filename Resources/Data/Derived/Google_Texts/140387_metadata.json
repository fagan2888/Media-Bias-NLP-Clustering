These frustrating situations have taught me a lot about active listening, partnership, patience, and persistence. Some of these experiences could be useful to those of us who strongly oppose Donald Trump becoming President but have friends, family, or colleagues who are either supportive of or comfortable with his candidacy.\n\n1. Abandoning Trump Supporters Is Not An Option.\n\nThis is logistically obvious for those of us who are related to or share workplaces with Trump supporters. Nonetheless, some people may already be disengaging from anything and anyone remotely connected to Trump. Cutting off all ties may seem practical and sustainable, but it's not.\n\nWhile there is a strong possibility (too early to call it a certainty) that Trump will lose the Presidential election, his supporters can succeed in electing members of Congress, governors, state legislators, mayors, and city council members who share the billionaire's clear cruelty and nebulous policies. We have to understand Trump's influence as a chronic problem with potential ripple effects at multiple levels. American democracy has many \"organ systems,\" like state and city governments, serving various functions which impact day-to-day life, vulnerable to toxic decision-making. Trump's influence is like a cigarette addiction, not a sprained ankle to ignore and \"walk off.\"\n\nThis leaves us with no choice but to engage Trump's supporters, as misguided as they are. They're our fellow Americans, and our country functions best (morally, economically, etc.) when we refuse to leave anyone behind, as difficult as that may be. This camaraderie is the moral high ground for which we need to aspire.\n\n2. Some Differences Are Irreconcilable.\n\nThis may seem contradictory to the previous point, but in searching for common ground, we have to be clear where there won't be any. The bigotry, sexism, xenophobia, and other cruelties of the Trump campaign are simply unacceptable in any moral society. Calling these problems out by name is a responsibility we owe each other. Some of Trump's level-headed supporters would have us believe he and his more obnoxious supporters are \"just saying those things for attention.\" But if we are to believe that Trump is \"telling it like it is,\" and if his \"authenticity\" is so appealing, then why shouldn't we take the campaign's threats to immigrants, Muslims, and dissenters seriously? Protesters at Trump's rallies are doing their part. Whether you prefer confrontations, conversations, or a little of both, please choose action over apathy. Polite silence may feel like an easy way to save face and prevent awkward moments, but consider this: when you need someone to have your back, would you accept their polite silence? What would you want him/her to do? Now go do that.\n\n3. Acknowledge Mutual Pain.\n\nTo be clear, the presence of irreconcilable differences does not automatically rule out the existence of any and all common ground. In my clinical experience, my patients' families and I rarely have completely incompatible perspectives on diagnoses or treatment plans. However, when those situations arise, I pay more attention to the gaps in our communication. I acknowledge the patient's and family's experiences of pain, even if their perspectives on how or why it arose differ from mine.\n\nSome of you may be thinking of President Bill Clinton's famous \"I feel your pain\" line, but this is not a joke and it's certainly not meant to pander. Problems like unemployment or under-employment; making the rent or mortgage; affording child care; paying for higher education and student debt; and managing the costs of prescription medications are some of the many challenges American families face, regardless of their politics. During election years, we may talk about these issues on a national level, but they are felt on many smaller neighborhood levels, unique from each other. In acknowledging our fellow Americans' pain, frustrations, and stresses, there are opportunities to be seen and heard -- for both Trump's supporters and his opponents. Recognizing pain and genuinely saying \"the struggle is real\" has the potential (not the certainty) to lower some defenses and tempers.\n\n4. The Solutions Are Not Simple, and That's Okay.\n\nHaving acknowledged the experience of my patients' pain, I usually describe my perspectives on what is causing the pain and why a certain treatment plan will be effective. Simultaneously, I directly ask families for their thoughts: is there more I need to know; how do my assessments fit with their perspectives; what can we work on together; and so on. All of this dialogue is particularly important because on the surface, there is so much that potentially divides us as doctor, patient, and caregiver: ethnicity, gender, age, education level, socioeconomic status, personal struggles, power dynamics in the clinical environment, etc. The thing I try my best to demonstrate is a commitment to bridge-building and bridge maintenance despite whatever divides us. Another thing I convey is that complexity and setbacks are common, and these require cooperation to overcome. Scapegoating and over-simplifying problems stall us from the real work at hand.\n\nThe challenge of political discussions, like many tough clinical conversations, is that we have to divest ourselves from wishful thinking and easy solutions. Civics and policy-making in a democracy are complex and imperfect, like the citizens of that democracy. The problems described two paragraphs earlier will require multilateral policies, careful implementation, and thorough review of all that work -- the exact opposite of the simplicity and quick fixes that struggling people yearn for and campaigns want to market. What Trump offers: the wall on the southern border; confusing our allies abroad; repealing and replacing Obamacare with \"something terrific,\" are all schemes divorced from the realities of how our Constitution guides us to build a more perfect union.\n\nAdmittedly, I am not exemplary in my execution of the previously discussed ideals when it comes to \"confrontational\" patient care. There are also some self-evident flaws in comparing doctor-patient conversations to those between concerned citizens. However, the preservation of civility is paramount in the clinical space and in the public political arena. In our interactions with Trump's supporters, pushing back against cynicism and cruelty to make room for civility is a tough endeavor. Approaches will vary by necessity. There will be direct, possibly impolite confrontations when differences are irreconcilable and human dignity must be upheld. Alternatively, where we find mutual areas of pain and frustration, we can have calmer conversations about how to resolve problems within and without politics. No matter what, giving up on our fellow Americans is simply not an option. Making \"progress\" while excluding others has not worked for America before, and undermines the very concept of progress. At a time when the health of our country was at its lowest, President Lincoln implored us to \"do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves...\" Let's keep up that hard work in this contentious year and in the years ahead.\n\nFollow Sanjeev K.
