Oral arguments are scheduled for Monday before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.\n\nThe ads would appear in newspapers, on TV, websites and cigarette pack inserts. The ads, called \u201ccorrective statements,\u201d stem from a civil case the government brought in 1999 under RICO, the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act.\n\nThe companies say they stand ready and willing to disseminate factual public health information about cigarettes. But they argue that these ads are designed to ensure that the public \u201cdoes not believe anything the companies say on any topic.\u201d\n\nThe companies are asking the appeals court to set aside the corrective statements and craft new ones.\n\nThe preamble to the ads says a \u201cfederal court has ruled that Altria, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco, Lorillard, and Philip Morris USA deliberately deceived the American public.\u201d\n\nThe companies say the statement is overbroad and misleading.\n\nTheir reasoning is that the findings cited by the judge pertain to the alleged inaccuracy of the companies\u2019 public statements about smoking and health, not to whether anyone in the public was actually deceived by the defendants.\n\nThe question of whether the companies deceived the public is a disputed factual issue in every fraud case brought against the defendants by an individual smoker, the companies said in a recent court filing.\n\nThey say that if the corrective statements are not modified, the question of whether the companies deceived the public will be decided by jurors exposed on countless occasions to the erroneous assertion that the companies engaged in deception.\n\nThe companies in the case include Richmond, Virginia-based Altria Group Inc., owner of the biggest U.S. tobacco company, Philip Morris USA; No. 2 cigarette maker, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., owned by Winston-Salem, North Carolina-based Reynolds American Inc.; and No. 3 cigarette maker Lorillard Inc., based in Greensboro, North Carolina.\n\nKessler required the companies to publicly address smoking\u2019s adverse health effects, nicotine manipulation and the health impact of secondhand smoke. The judge also required that the companies address the truth about \u201clight\u201d and low tar\u201d brands and the nature of cigarette addiction.\n\nThe judge said the corrective statements would be in all cigarette packs sold for 12 weeks over the course of two years, in TV spots once per week for a year, in a separate newspaper ad by each company, on company websites indefinitely and at certain retail outlets.\n\nIn 2009, the appeals court directed Kessler to craft corrective statements confined to purely factual and uncontroversial information that would reveal previously hidden truths about the tobacco industry\u2019s products.\n\nBut the companies said in a recent filing that Kessler went beyond those instructions and ordered inflammatory statements that require the defendants to denigrate themselves.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bloodied but unbeaten, the tobacco companies have plunged into another courtroom battle in an effort to stave off the humiliation of having to underwrite an ad campaign in which they brand themselves as liars.", "pubdate": 20150221, "og": {"site_name": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "Bloodied but unbeaten, the tobacco companies have plunged into another courtroom battle in an effort to stave off the humiliation of having to underwrite an ad campaign in which they brand themselves as liars.", "title": "Tobacco companies resist corrective statement about harms of smoking", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/cigarettes.jpg", "url": "http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/tobacco-companies-resist-corrective-statement-harms-smoking/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "Bloodied but unbeaten, the tobacco companies have plunged into another courtroom battle in an effort to stave off the humiliation of having to underwrite an ad campaign in which they brand themselves as liars.", "title": "Tobacco companies resist corrective statement about harms of smoking", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/cigarettes.jpg", "creator": "@newshour", "site": "@newshour", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"app_id": 114150878604116}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newshour", "tag": "tobacco"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "cigarette industry, corrective statement, Gladys Kessler, tobacco"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddbd8\"", "article_summary": "The companies say they stand ready and willing to disseminate factual public health information about cigarettes.\nThe ads, called \u201ccorrective statements,\u201d stem from a civil case the government brought in 1999 under RICO, the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act.\nBloodied but unbeaten, the tobacco companies have plunged into another courtroom battle in an effort to stave off the humiliation of having to underwrite an ad campaign in which they brand themselves as liars.\nIn 2009, the appeals court directed Kessler to craft corrective statements confined to purely factual and uncontroversial information that would reveal previously hidden truths about the tobacco industry\u2019s products.\nThe companies in the case include Richmond, Virginia-based Altria Group Inc., owner of the biggest U.S. tobacco company, Philip Morris USA; No."}
