King Jr., President Barack Obama\u2019s nominee, as secretary of education.\n\nA total of 11 senators did not vote on King\u2019s confirmation, while those who voted against him cited his loyalty to the system and support for Common Core education standards.\n\n>>> Here\u2019s the roll call vote for King\u2019s confirmation:\n\nKing, 41, has been the acting secretary of the Department of Education since January, after Arne Duncan stepped down from the Cabinet post at the end of last year.\n\nSen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., secretary of education under President George H.W. Bush, spoke in support of King on the Senate floor.\n\nBut Sens. James Lankford, R-Okla., and Mike Lee, R-Utah, spoke against confirming King\u2019s nomination.\n\n\u201cThe problem is not that Dr. King lacks experience,\u201d Lee said, adding:\n\nAfter three years as a teacher and a brief stint managing charter schools, Dr. King has risen through the ranks of the education bureaucracy, climbing from one political appointment to the next. But do we really think that someone who has spent more time in a government agency than in a classroom is best suited to oversee federal education policy?\n\nThe eight Republicans who did not vote were Ted Cruz of Texas, Jeff Flake of Arizona, Mark Kirk of Illinois, John McCain of Arizona, Rob Portman of Ohio, Marco Rubio of Florida, Jeff Sessions of Alabama, and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania.\n\nThe two Democrats who did not vote were Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Mark Warner of Virginia.\n\nVermont\u2019s Bernie Sanders, an independent, also did not vote.\n\nOnly one Democrat, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, voted no on King.\n\nMajority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and six other Republicans voted yes: Alexander, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, Thad Cochran of Mississippi, Susan Collins of Maine, John Cornyn of Texas, and Orrin Hatch of Utah.\n\nAlexander is chairman of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, which last week voted 16-6 in favor of King, sending his nomination to the full Senate.\n\nAlexander said an education secretary needs to be in place to provide proper accountability. He specified implementation of the bipartisan Every Student Succeeds Act, a rewrite of the No Child Left Behind education law.\n\n\u201cWe need an education secretary confirmed by and accountable to the United States Senate so that the law fixing No Child Left Behind will be implemented the way Congress wrote it,\u201d Alexander said a statement Monday.\n\nHe added:\n\nThis is such an important year for our nation\u2019s 100,000 public schools. We are working to implement a new law that reverses the trend toward a national school board and restores to those closest to children the responsibility for their well-being and academic success. That\u2019s why, in December, I urged the president to send to the Senate a nominee for education secretary\u2014and I\u2019m glad there\u2019s now someone confirmed and accountable to Congress as we implement this new bipartisan law that represents such a dramatic and important change in direction for federal education policy for 50 million children and 3.4 million teachers in 100,000 public schools.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who voted to confirm King, said on the Senate floor before Monday\u2019s vote:\n\nWhile there\u2019s only a year left in the Obama presidency, this is still one of the most important jobs in Washington because the Department of Education has a powerful set of tools available that it can use to stand up for people who are struggling with student loan debt and tools to help make a quality, affordable college education a reality of millions of Americans.\n\nSecretary of Ed is one of the toughest jobs, because for yrs @usedgov has put student loan companies & for-profit colleges before students. \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) March 14, 2016\n\n\u201cDr. King has an enormous amount of work to do to get the department\u2019s higher education house in order and the American people will be watching closely for results,\u201d she added.\n\nPatty Murray, D-Wash., ranking member of the committee, called King a \u201cstrong nominee.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one can question his passion for our nation\u2019s young people,\u201d Murray said in support of King\u2019s nomination on the Senate floor Monday. \u201cThis administration has a little less than a year left in office, but that is still plenty of time to make progress in several key areas and that progress is more likely with a confirmed secretary in place at the department.\u201d\n\nObama announced his intent to nominate King in mid-February, calling him an \u201caccomplished, lifelong educator.\u201d\n\nKing has been a public school teacher, a principal, and the co-founder of a charter school.\n\nHe served as commissioner of the New York State Education Department from 2011 to 2015. During his tenure, he supervised implementation of the hotly debated Common Core State Standards.\n\n\"I am confident that Dr. John King is a strong nominee to transition from Acting Secretary to\u2026 position of Secretary of Education\" -Murray \u2014 HELP Committee Dems (@HELPCmteDems) February 25, 2016\n\nOverall, @JohnKingatED has spent his career fighting for students so they get the chance to learn, grow, & thrive in the classroom & beyond. \u2014 HELP Committee Dems (@HELPCmteDems) February 25, 2016\n\nIn his floor remarks, Lee also said:\n\nLook closely at his record\u2014especially the three and a half years he spent as New York\u2019s education commissioner, where he forced on an unwilling school system unpopular Common Core curriculum and standards, an inflexible testing regime, and a flawed teacher evaluation system. All of this proves that Dr. King is the standard bearer of No Child Left Behind\u2014the discredited K-12 regime that has become synonymous with dysfunctional education policy in classrooms and households across America. This isn\u2019t just my opinion; it was the opinion of New York\u2019s parents, teachers, legislators, school board members, and superintendents\u2014the vast majority of whom opposed, and protested against, Dr. King and the policies he championed while at the helm of the state\u2019s education department.\n\nIn his remarks, Lankford said:\n\nI shared with Dr. King that, in the view of many legal experts and school officials across the country, the Department of Education has been bullying schools to comply with policies that simply do not have the force of law. This use of power, however well intentioned, is wrong, and it\u2019s unlawful. Leadership requires making those sure within the department conduct themselves in full compliance with the law.\n\nI have no choice but to oppose @JohnKingatED's nomination today for Secretary of Education. Watch my floor speech: https://t.co/Iz77iuT3WU \u2014 Sen. James Lankford (@SenatorLankford) March 14, 2016\n\nSen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., who voted \u201cno\u201d in committee and in Monday\u2019s vote, said in a statement last week that King is \u201cclearly the wrong person for the job.\u201d\n\nI urge my colleagues to vote NO on John King. He is the wrong person for Ed Sec job. #StopJohnKing \u2014 Richard Burr (@SenatorBurr) March 14, 2016\n\n\u201cWe need someone who will listen to teachers and parents,\u201d Burr said, adding:\n\nJohn King has demonstrated that he is not that person. While serving as state education commissioner in New York, he made education worse by forcing big government Common Core standards on teachers and students, and pushing policies that violated student privacy. In addition to promoting bad policy, King exhibited poor judgment as a manager\u2014knowingly allowing lawbreakers to continue serving in senior positions without penalty.\n\nI cannot support John King's nomination bc of our fundamental difference of opinion on the importance of state & local control of education. \u2014 Johnny Isakson (@SenatorIsakson) March 14, 2016\n\nSen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., also opposed King in committee and in the the full Senate vote.\n\n\u201cI want to thank Dr. John King for his willingness to discuss important issues facing our nation\u2019s education system throughout this process,\u201d Scott said last week in a statement.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately,\u201d Scott said, \u201chis lack of support for critical issues surrounding school choice, such as reauthorizing the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program, leave me unable to support his nomination. I am also concerned with his support for Common Core, signaling a willingness to exert more federal control over education.\u201d\n\nScott added:\n\nWe must ensure that every child across this nation has access to a quality education. School choice provides that opportunity, and I sincerely hope that not just Dr. King, but the entire Obama administration, will reconsider their opposition to this critical issue.\n\nToday I voted against the nomination of John King for Sec. of Education b/c he supports #CommonCore & other top-down education policies. \u2014 Richard Shelby (@SenShelby) March 14, 2016\n\nThis report was updated to include new quotations and tweets from senators about the King nomination.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Those who voted against John King cited his loyalty\u00a0to the system\u00a0and support for Common Core education standards.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Those who voted against John King cited his loyalty\u00a0to the system\u00a0and support for Common Core education standards.", "title": "Common Core Advocate Confirmed as Education Secretary", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160314_EducationNominee_Jessen.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-03-15T15:52:04+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1Ucj1ge"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Those who voted against John King cited his loyalty\u00a0to the system\u00a0and support for Common Core education standards.", "title": "Common Core Advocate Confirmed as Education Secretary", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160314_EducationNominee_Jessen.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Education", "tag": "common core", "published_time": "2016-03-14T20:22:09+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-15T15:52:04+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Department of Education, John King, Education Secretary, Senate, Obama Education, education reform, common core, school choice"}, "article_summary": "Alexander said an education secretary needs to be in place to provide proper accountability.\n\u2014 Richard Shelby (@SenShelby) March 14, 2016This report was updated to include new quotations and tweets from senators about the King nomination.\nI cannot support John King's nomination bc of our fundamental difference of opinion on the importance of state & local control of education.\n\u201cI want to thank Dr. John King for his willingness to discuss important issues facing our nation\u2019s education system throughout this process,\u201d Scott said last week in a statement.\nI have no choice but to oppose @JohnKingatED's nomination today for Secretary of Education."}
