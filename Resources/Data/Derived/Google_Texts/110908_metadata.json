Its sale is the last and most important leg of the government's attempt to recoup as much as possible of more than $12 billion used to bail out the financial group over a decade ago.\n\nBut selling off its assets has been a complicated and drawn out affair as South Korea requires at least two bidders for a government sale by law, and as foreign investors are reluctant to enter a market seen as having poor returns and difficult to exit.\n\n\"Because the financial and banking sectors are in a difficult situation, it's not a situation where we can generally expect massive demand,\" said Park Sang-yong, chairman of the Public Funds Oversight Committee in charge of recouping bailout funds.\n\n\"It's hard to tell at the moment...another bidder could emerge in the next 5-6 months,\" Park said.\n\nWoori Bank, which has become a big corporate lender under the state ownership, saw operating profit slide by almost a third to 464 billion won ($455 million) in 2013, hit hard by failures of units owned by cash-strapped local conglomerates.\n\nSouth Korea's National Pension Service, the world's fourth-largest pension fund, and other investors own the remaining 43 percent of Woori Bank.\n\nDEARTH OF FOREIGN INTEREST\n\nThe government has so far recouped 5.8 trillion won from Woori asset sales as of May though that figure does not include gains from two units that have been sold. Proceeds of some asset sales are expected to go towards paying down Woori Finance's debt.\n\nThere was limited foreign investor interest in some earlier asset sales, but all chosen buyers have been local.\n\nCosts have risen and competition has intensified in South Korea's banking market, prompting Citigroup Inc, Standard Chartered Bank and HSBC to all pull back.\n\nUnder the government's plan, Woori Finance Holdings will first be merged with Woori Bank so the bank's value is roughly equivalent to the 8.2 trillion won ($8 billion) market cap of Woori Finance, a government official said, declining to be identified as he was not authorised to talk to the media.\n\nA 30 percent stake would be worth some $2.4 billion but a winning bid is also expected to include a premium, taking the potential sale amount to around $3 billion, analysts have said.\n\nThe remaining 27 percent will be sold off in a dutch auction where bidders will bid for preferred stake sizes of between 0.5 percent and 10 percent.\n\nBoth tranches will proceed simultaneously. Bidders are free to bid in both tranches and multiple times in the dutch auction.\n\nThe sales notice will be out in September after tapping the market for bidder interest and bids are expected to be due by end-November, the Financial Services Commission said.\n\nPreferred bidders for the 30 percent stake and the smaller stakes are set to be chosen within the year, it added.
