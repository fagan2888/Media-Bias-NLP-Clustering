Three months after the failed launch of its online health-insurance enrollment system, the state\u0092s renewed discussions with outside vendors show its desperation to find a working solution.

(AP) \u2014 Cover Oregon is trying to figure out how many people who enrolled in private health insurance plans may owe more tax money as a result of the exchange\u2019s blunder in calculating federal tax credits.\n\nExecutive Director Aaron Patnode said the exchange used the wrong formula to calculate credits for individuals and families with incomes between 139% and 400% of the federal poverty line.\n\nIn Oregon, about 80% of the 67,500 people who have paid plan premiums qualified for a tax credit.\n\nThe error is limited to those who purchased nonstandard plans that cover alternative care beyond the 10 essential health benefits mandated under the Affordable Care Act \u2014 such as acupuncture and chiropractic care.\n\nMost plans on the exchange contain only the 10 essential benefits, such as hospitalization, emergency or preventive services.\n\nPeople who bought plans in Marion and Polk counties could also be affected, because those counties\u2019 standard silver plans \u2014 which are used as a benchmark for the tax credits \u2014 contain nonessential benefits. Currently, 3,500 people get tax credits in Marion and Polk counties, according to Cover Oregon, though only some would be affected by the error.\n\nIn all other counties, the standard plans contain only the essential 10 benefits.\n\nAnd only people who took their credits in advance would be affected by the error. Under the ACA, people can choose to use some or all of their credit right away to lower their monthly premium, but they can also wait and use it when they file their taxes, reducing the total amount of taxes owed.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still working to identify the size and scope of this problem,\u201d Patnode said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very complicated issue given how individualized the application is.\u201d\n\nThe exchange discovered the error as it was preparing a report for the Internal Revenue Service.\n\nEssentially, Patnode said, Cover Oregon based its tax credit calculations on the total value of people\u2019s premiums, instead of basing them on the portion of the plans that represent the 10 essential health benefits.\n\nFor those affected by the error, it\u2019s still unclear how much they would have to pay back, officials said. In most cases analyzed thus far, nonessential health benefits represented only a small percent of the plans \u2014 about 2% \u2014 though in some cases alternative care represented a higher share of the plan.\n\nThe amount to be returned to the IRS would depend on the individual\u2019s or family\u2019s income and plan, on how much tax credit was used in advance or other factors. There are limits as to how much would have to be paid back, Patnode said.\n\nUnder the ACA, people who receive advance payments of the credit can \u201creconcile\u201d it on their tax returns \u2014 and the amount they would have to repay would be capped if their income is less than 400% of the poverty level. For example, an individual whose income falls under $22,980 wouldn\u2019t have to return more than $300. One whose income falls between $34,470 and $45,960 would not pay back more than $1,250.\n\nCover Oregon has made federal officials aware of the problem, Patnode said, and is working with them to see if the error-caused additional taxes can be waived, but the state hasn\u2019t heard an answer back thus far.", "article_metadata": {"norton-safeweb-site-verification": "46bykeo2i0s-akw2xw95c4niny8dm8q2hq2q--p6sq9m44il5276m4e6zl3aewxb9eje2k-8ahjwqf4l2xznzs7ryf88y3cugtu9sy16hu69onbc-aftcwjs4pwj7f74", "description": "The exchange used the wrong formula to calculate credits for individuals and families with incomes between 139% and 400% of the federal poverty line.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.linmedia.newstouch.koin", "og": {"site_name": "KOIN 6", "description": "The exchange used the wrong formula to calculate credits for individuals and families with incomes between 139% and 400% of the federal poverty line.", "title": "Cover Oregon scrambles to fix tax credit error", "url": "http://koin.com/2014/09/08/cover-oregon-scrambles-to-fix-tax-credit-error/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "https://lintvkoin.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/cover-oregon-2.jpg", "height": 366}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The exchange used the wrong formula to calculate credits for individuals and families with incomes between 139% and 400% of the federal poverty line.", "title": "Cover Oregon scrambles to fix tax credit error", "image": {"src": "https://lintvkoin.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/cover-oregon-2.jpg?w=640"}, "creator": "@koinnews", "site": "koinnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Portland Breaking News, Weather, Sports and Traffic", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=411685184", "fb": {"pages": 201148780086040}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://koin.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/14b04f7776cb146ac02da7d9f2520ae3?s=16", "application-name": "KOIN 6", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/koin6", "published_time": "2014-09-09T00:53:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-09T00:53:20+00:00"}, "msvalidate.01": "25404283363C09DE121A55A903F03873", "google-site-verification": "vzU_UZiJT4xFXAdXje_mcSljJEG-ROUbQhc5qkumYRE", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "zipcodes": "97201, 97203, 97204, 97205, 97206, 97207, 97208, 97209, 97210, 97211, 97212, 97213, 97214, 97215, 97216, 97227, 97266, 97005, 97225, 97015, 98661, 97030"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd343d\"", "article_summary": "Cover Oregon has had to rely exclusively on paper applications and had to hire more than 400 workers to process them manually.\nCurrently, 3,500 people get tax credits in Marion and Polk counties, according to Cover Oregon, though only some would be affected by the error.\nFile--In this Nov. 18, 2013, file photo, a roomful of people work to process applications for Cover Oregon, the states' health exchange program, in Keizer, Ore., Monday, Nov. 18, 2013.\nIn Oregon, about 80% of the 67,500 people who have paid plan premiums qualified for a tax credit.\nEssentially, Patnode said, Cover Oregon based its tax credit calculations on the total value of people\u2019s premiums, instead of basing them on the portion of the plans that represent the 10 essential health benefits."}
