And he skewered President Obama for \u201cinconsistent and indecisive leadership\u201d abroad in his first major foreign policy pronouncements since entering the 2016 GOP presidential fray.\n\nIn prepared remarks for a speech this morning at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, Bush wasted little time in distancing himself from the record of his father and brother, former Presidents George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush.\n\nRelated: Jeb Bush Faces Sharp Dilemma in Dealing with ISIS\n\n\u201cI love my father and my brother. I admire their service to the nation and the difficult decisions they had to make,\u201d Bush said. \u201cBut I am my own man \u2013 and my views are shaped by my own thinking and own experiences.\u201d\n\nAs he begins to assemble a campaign organization and massive fundraising network, Jeb Bush must walk a fine line between trading on the notoriety of his famous political family and asserting his independence from the views and record of his father and brother.\n\nThis is critical as he addresses the ongoing crisis in the Middle East \u2013 particularly in in Iraq, a country where his father fought a war and a country his brother invaded and occupied following the 9/11 attacks.\n\nMany critics today blame the policies of George W. Bush for the chaos and terrorism besetting Iraq and neighboring countries, and many GOP leaders long ago began distancing themselves from the former president.\n\nRelated: Jeb Bush Could Rake in Record Campaign Funds\n\nVoters and rival campaigns are watching closely to see how heavily he leans on veterans of the two past Bush administrations for support, The Washington Post reported today. In his prepared remarks, Jeb Bush says he has been lucky to have a father and a brother \u201cwho both have shaped America\u2019s foreign policy from the Oval Office.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a result, my views will often be held up in comparison to theirs \u2013 sometimes in contrast to theirs,\u201d he said. Bush added, \u201cEach president learns from those who came before \u2013 their principles, their adjustments. One thing we know is this: Every president inherits a changing world and changing circumstances.\n\nRelated: Issues That Could Derail Jeb Bush\u2019s 2016 Hopes\n\nStrong American leadership overseas, he said \u2013 \u201cprojected consistently and grounded in principle \u2013 has been a benefit to the world.\u201d But in turning his attention to President Obama\u2019s stewardship these past six years, he said, \u201cI have doubts whether this administration believes American power is such a force.\u201d\n\n\u201dUnder this administration, we are inconsistent and indecisive. We have lost the trust and the confidence of our friends. We definitely no longer inspire fear in our enemies. \u201dHe also said, \u201cThe great irony of the Obama presidency is this: Someone who came to office promising greater engagement with the world has left America less influential in the world.\u201d\n\nhighly critical of the president\u2019s handling of crises in the Middle East, Eastern Europe and other global hot spots, Bush offered few specific prescriptions for improvements besides bolstering defense spending and projecting greater economic strength abroad.\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s word needs to be backed by the greatest military power in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThe president should call on leaders of both parties to fix the budget and address the shortfalls in our defense spending. Obama has in fact proposed lifting spending caps to substantially boost defense spending in the coming fiscal year.\n\nBush also said having a military equal to any threat \u201cis not only essential for the commander in chief, it also makes it less likely that we will need to put our men and women in uniform in harm\u2019s way.\u201d\n\nRelated: Scott Walker Makes Top Tier of White House Wannabes\n\nMoreover, he said, \u201cThe transformation of our economy will also send a powerful message about the American system: Free people, free markets, free ideas \u2026 implemented faithfully\u2026 will set a powerful example of what\u2019s possible to the rest of the world.\n\n\u201cOur words and our actions must match \u2013 so that the entire world knows we say what we mean and mean what we say,\u201d he said.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Former Florida governor Jeb Bush declared Wednesday that he is his", "title": "Jeb Bush Assails President Obama for Poor Leadership", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/18/Jeb-Bush-Assails-President-Obama-Poor-Leadership", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/Jeb_Bush_4.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/18/Jeb-Bush-Assails-President-Obama-Poor-Leadership", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/Jeb_Bush_4.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Former Florida governor Jeb Bush declared Wednesday that he is his", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf828\"", "article_summary": "Former Florida governor Jeb Bush declared Wednesday that he is his own man when it comes to formulating his views on foreign policy.\nRelated: Jeb Bush Faces Sharp Dilemma in Dealing with ISIS\u201cI love my father and my brother.\nAnd he skewered President Obama for \u201cinconsistent and indecisive leadership\u201d abroad in his first major foreign policy pronouncements since entering the 2016 GOP presidential fray.\nRelated: Jeb Bush Could Rake in Record Campaign FundsVoters and rival campaigns are watching closely to see how heavily he leans on veterans of the two past Bush administrations for support, The Washington Post reported today.\nBush and George W.
