I am going to take care of everybody. The government is going to pay for it.\u201d\n\n\"Donald, don\u2019t you know Hillarycare, Obamacare and Trumpcare are government-run healthcare?\u201d the announcer says.\n\nThe clips seem to prove that Trump supports \"government-run health care,\" as the ad says.\n\nBut Trump's position on health care is ambiguous at best. Unlike the Democratic opponents to whom he's being compared, he has not unveiled a detailed plan.\n\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders advocates a single-payer system, which would provide Medicare for all.\n\nClinton has vowed to uphold and build upon the existing Affordable Care Act.\n\nTrump has made a number of statements indicating that he wants the government to be involved in the nation's health care.\n\nIn one interview, he suggested that the government should negotiate with hospitals and drug companies for lower prices.\n\nTrump also said insurance companies that are deemed \"financially responsible\" by the government should be allowed to sell health plans across state lines.\n\nTrump told \"60 Minutes\" last September that he will replace Obamacare with his own plan.\n\n\"I don't care if it costs me votes or not,\" Trump said. \"Everybody's going to be taken care of much better than they're taken care of now. The government's going to pay for it. But we're going to save so much money on the other side.\"\n\nRegardless, Truth Check believes that the claim in the ad that compares Trump's position on health care to the Democrats' is false. Until the presidential candidate provides a detailed plan, it's impossible to make a comparison.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Local News", "ib-analytics": "data", "item-publish-date": "Thu, 11 Feb 2016 21:36:30 EST", "generator": "CoreMedia", "author": "Tim Waller", "og": {"site_name": "WYFF4", "description": "A new political ad accuses Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump of having the same position on health care as the Democrats.
