My father was immensely talented and worked very hard at his writing, but the degree of his success was a fantastically unlikely bit of luck. There are lots of talented, hard-working artists who don\u2019t make it.\n\nThe important thing in overcoming mental illness, whether or not you have a famous last name, is to want things to be better \u2014 and being willing to get help to make that happen.\n\nBoth of my parents\u2019 families advised them to stay away from one another, as mental illness was rumored to be in each other\u2019s family. The rumors were true, but it wasn\u2019t like anyone then or now comes with any guarantees. It makes us feel more alive to be able to see, listen to and read great art, partly because great art is often the result of great struggle. The idea that artists and \u201cthe mentally ill\u201d have inner demons while the rest of us do not is part of what has made it \u2014 and continues to make it \u2014 so hard to come to terms with mental illness.\n\nThe reason the arts and craziness run in families is because crazy people who can sing and dance and paint pictures and write well do a much better job of convincing others to have babies with them than if they\u2019re just plain crazy. Thus has it ever been.\n\nIn my career as a mental patient, I started with schizophrenia, worked my way up through manic depression, and have now settled at bipolar disorder. I can joke about it because I recovered sufficiently to get into and through medical school, internship and residency, and have had the enormous honor and privilege of being trusted by parents to help them and their children. I make no bones about it; I make mistakes just like everyone else, but am very proud of how well I do my job.\n\nI\u2019m also very aware of how easily I could have ended up otherwise \u2014 a suicide statistic or just another broken young man who never got well enough to have a life.\n\nThe diagnosis doesn\u2019t matter much. What they think you have can give doctors a clue about what to do or not do, but for the person who is suffering, and for those who love him or her, wanting the pain and trouble to stop is enough. Knowing that others have recovered is very helpful; most patients, including myself, have diagnosed themselves as hopeless more than once.\n\nI think my father had PTSD, and Faulkner was a depressed narcissist who drank too much. Who cares? The important point is that in spite of whatever \u201cit\u201d was that they had, they both managed to write magnificent transcendent literature that makes us all a little smarter and less lonely.\n\nWhat matters is that their art stabilized them and gave them purpose, along with a substantial amount of fame and fortune. We have the relationship between creativity and mental illness exactly wrong; \u201ccrazy\u201d people don\u2019t create great art unless they are getting better. The illusion that someone in early recovery can simply chuck their meds and produce great art has sent many gifted young people over the cliff.\n\nWhether or not someone needs psychiatric medication is beside the point. The point is to lead a good life and sustain loving relationships. I\u2019m an optimistic person; on a regular basis I find myself looking in the mirror, hoping to see someone who doesn\u2019t need medication staring back at me. However, seeing as I\u2019m 67, that probably isn\u2019t going to happen. And so, I try to make a little joke to myself as I take yet another dose of antipsychotic or mood stabilizing medication: \u201cBoy, I sure hope this stuff works!\u201d\n\nMedications have side effects. No one who doesn\u2019t need them should take them \u2014 I know I certainly wouldn\u2019t. It\u2019s a painful truth that medications and psychiatric hospitals, the faults of which could fill volumes, have both saved me, and made a good life for myself possible. For that, I am grateful.\n\nSymptoms do not a diagnosis make. You can be impulsive, grandiose with flighty ideas and think everything you see on TV is about you without being \u201ccrazy.\u201d The thing about being mentally ill is not being able to attend to day-to-day life, or be part of healthy relationships.\n\nThe reverse is also true; just because you don\u2019t hear voices, doesn\u2019t make you a model of mental health. One of the problems with mental health diagnosis is how reassuring the process is to \u201cso-called normal\u201d people. The sub-text to me having a thinking disorder is that your thinking is fine. I freely admit that I have an affective disorder, and find the idea that my feelings are more than a little off-base a huge relief \u2014 but to jump from my affective disorder to the conclusion that your feelings make perfect sense is just illogical.\n\nThere are all kinds of statistics, but the bottom line is that no one among us is 100 percent crazy, and no one is 100 percent sane. The chance that you or someone you love won\u2019t need help at some point with what we broadly call \u201cmental illness\u201d is 0.\n\nYou don\u2019t need a psychiatrist or a doctor to start the process of recovery. While a full-blown psychotic break involving emergency rooms and psychiatric hospitals is one way to go, I don\u2019t recommend it. You\u2019d think that the humiliation involved in that route would make it easier to accept help, but you\u2019d be wrong. All you need is the desire to have things be different. It\u2019s amazing how readily people accept depression, or alcoholism, or anxiety as the way things have to be. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a friend, family member, or professional who tells you that your life can get better; all you have to do is accept the truth as best you can, and be willing to take the next step. Whether that step leads to a therapist, or AA, or NAMI doesn\u2019t really matter.\n\nThe good thing about recovery is that it\u2019s progressive. Just like depression, anxiety, addiction, PTSD and all the other diseases tend to worsen over time, a good friend or therapist can progress to a good treatment program, a good job, or appropriate medication. People who get better help other people get better. Someone who manages to find recovery can, and often does, help countless others in ways no one could possibly predict.\n\nI\u2019m a shameless eclectic pragmatist in my work as a pediatrician. Having raised three of them myself, I\u2019m well aware that most adolescent and pre-adolescent boys would rather drink poison than talk with a therapist, but they also don\u2019t want things to go on the way they have been. So I mention therapy as something I can probably get them out of if they\u2019re willing to clean up their room, do their homework, maybe eat a little better and stop swearing at their mother. Most of them think they can do this. I point out that whether things go well or not, they can always go back to swearing at their parents and slamming doors, but regardless, I want to see them again in a week or two to see how the experiment is going. Acupuncture, yoga, IEPs, social skills groups \u2014 it truly doesn\u2019t matter.\n\nWhat Thorazine did for me 45 years ago was make it possible to talk to other people in the dayroom. Had my scraggly, 127-pound, Old-Testament-prophet self told them that I was going to get out of there, make it home with a lot of help from friends and family, work my way up from landscaping to medical school, publish a couple of books and raise three sons, they would have upped my meds, put me back in seclusion, or both.\n\nThere ain\u2019t no difference between them and us. We\u2019re all here to help each other through this, whatever it is.\n\nThere\u2019s almost always something positive you can do; the problem is believing in that possibility, and letting others help you figure out what it is.\n\nMark Vonnegut, M.D. is a Boston-area pediatrician who writes and speaks on mental health topics.
