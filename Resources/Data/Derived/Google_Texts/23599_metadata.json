Really.\n\nThe time spent sitting in a waiting room at doctors\u2019 offices has shortened in Maine and nationally in the past year, even as more people got health care insurance under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nCut down on wait times: Here\u2019s how \u2022 Book as early in the day as possible, before the doctor\u2019s office gets bogged down with unexpected problems. \u2022 Call ahead to ensure the doctor is running on schedule. \u2022 Don\u2019t be late. Be early or on time to make sure you get your appointment slot. \u2022 Ask to have any paperwork mailed to you ahead of time. \u2022 Keep calm. The doctor\u2019s staff will be more likely to accommodate a cooperative patient. \u2022 To make sure the appointment is useful, bring a list of issues and concerns so nothing is forgotten. \u2022 Bring a list of medications you take. \u2022 Ask to reschedule if you must wait too long. SOURCE: Southern Maine Medical Center and Lincoln Medical Partners\n\n\u201cFrom a patient\u2019s perspective, their problem is the most important problem. We try to respond to that urgency and need,\u201d said Andrew Russ, M.D., medical director of primary care with Lincoln Medical Partners in Damariscotta. \u201cWe\u2019re not as accessible as families want us to be but we\u2019re getting there and we\u2019re actively working on it.\n\nMaine ranked third best in terms of the shortest average wait time, according to a 2015 report by New Jersey-based health care firm Vitals. At 15 minutes and 56 seconds, Maine came in behind New Hampshire and Wisconsin for short wait times. Still, the wait in Maine was shorter than the national average wait time of 19 minutes and 16 seconds. The worst state? Alabama, with an average wait time of 23 minutes and 25 seconds, according to Vitals.\n\nCompared with the 2014 survey, Maine trimmed 11 seconds off its wait time and the national average wait dropped by one minute, according to Vitals.\n\nA variety of factors have come into play to improve wait times, including new efforts to improve patient satisfaction, electronic records that speed paperwork and chart transfers, and behind-the-scenes planning and better division of care among nurse practitioners, physician assistants and doctors so patients see the right caretaker the fastest.\n\nMaine also has a higher-than-average concentration of doctors, but mostly in urban centers rather than rural locales. Maine ranked seventh in terms of density of doctors. In 2012, Maine had 307.3 physicians per 100,000 residents, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges, which was higher than the national rate of 260.5 physicians per 100,000 people.\n\nMedical practices began paying more attention to wait times after patient surveys listed \u201cdelays\u201d among chief complaints and as competition for patient dollars intensified, doctors said.\n\n\u201cThe single most effective thing we do is the morning huddle,\u201d Russ said. \u201cWe strategize on how to tackle the day and plan for special cases and special needs.\u201d\n\nThe meeting consists of a nurse, a medical assistant, schedulers and doctors who run through the list of patients coming in that day to determine what paperwork and tests are needed, what potential bottlenecks might occur, which patients need special accommodations such as wheelchairs, or where there might be openings in the schedule to fit in emergency cases, Russ said.\n\nSouthern Maine Health Care\u2019s internal medicine practice in Biddeford studied how it managed patients from the moment they walked into the office to the time they left. They realized the practice had different procures depending on who logged in the patient or who walked the patient back to the exam room or which doctor was providing care.\n\n\u201cSometimes it was anecdotal. We would hear things like \u2018Why isn\u2019t my time as valuable as the doctor\u2019s?'\u201d said Karen Waycott, director of primary care operations at Southern Maine Health Care. \u201cNew systems and procedures and planning help us be more respectful of everyone\u2019s time.\u201d\n\nThe practice adopted standardized procedures for every action, making training easy and consistent, and the patient experience \u201cmuch smoother,\u201d said Waycott.\n\nSouthern Maine Health Care has an advisory group that includes patients, doctors, nurses and support staff who suggest improvements.\n\nRelated Read more from Healthy Maine Magazine\n\n\u201cThe improvements are coming from people who are living and breathing the systems everyday, the changes came from the bottom up \u2013 not the top down,\u201d said Lori Cote, practice manager at Southern Maine Health Care Internal Medicine in Biddeford.\n\nWaycott said Southern Maine Health Care tries to communicate better with patients by proactively explaining if and when a doctor is running behind schedule and offering to reschedule.\n\nPaying attention to wait times isn\u2019t just better for patient care and satisfaction rating, it\u2019s also good business, doctors said.\n\n\u201cIn this part of the country, we don\u2019t have to compete against Wal-Mart clinics or a CVS walk-in service yet. But we might at some point. We have to be more responsive,\u201d Russ said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Maine ranks No. 3 in the country for shortest wait time for medical care.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "description": "Maine ranks No. 3 in the country for shortest wait time for medical care.", "title": "Wait time shortens as medical practices become more efficient - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 999, "identifier": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/818915_98880-20160120_waittimes-00.jpg", "height": 687}, "updated_time": "2016-03-16T18:13:38-04:00", "url": "http://www.pressherald.com/2016/03/18/wait-time-shortens-as-practices-become-more-efficient/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Maine ranks No. 3 in the country for shortest wait time for medical care.", "title": "Wait time shortens as medical practices become more efficient - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "image": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/818915_98880-20160120_waittimes-00.jpg", "creator": "@pressherald", "site": "@pressherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=951845858", "fb": {"admins": 769488179, "app_id": 178078215650057}, "google-site-verification": "QWs9pxQP8fwo2-nR5mWopc6qCK2D3920f7bl-U-zkso", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pressherald", "section": "Health", "tag": "Healthy Maine Magazine", "published_time": "2016-03-18T14:00:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-16T18:13:38-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "SOURCE: Southern Maine Medical Center and Lincoln Medical Partners\u201cFrom a patient\u2019s perspective, their problem is the most important problem.\nMedical practices began paying more attention to wait times after patient surveys listed \u201cdelays\u201d among chief complaints and as competition for patient dollars intensified, doctors said.\nPaying attention to wait times isn\u2019t just better for patient care and satisfaction rating, it\u2019s also good business, doctors said.\n'\u201d said Karen Waycott, director of primary care operations at Southern Maine Health Care.\nSouthern Maine Health Care has an advisory group that includes patients, doctors, nurses and support staff who suggest improvements."}
