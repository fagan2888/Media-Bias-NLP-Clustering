Those range from birth control pills to surgical sterilization and include morning-after and week-after medications.\n\nDisregarding the tenets of some religions, the rules sparked a backlash by churches and religiously affiliated employers that find moral offense in some or all the contraceptive techniques.\n\nIn good faith (PAUL BUCKOWSKI/ALBANY TIMES UNION)\n\nThe administration retreated into offering a so-called accommodation: religious objectors need only file a piece of paper to opt out, at which point the government will order their insurers both to provide the coverage and to notify beneficiaries that the employers had nothing to do with it.\n\nBy the government\u2019s telling, the simple act of filling out a piece of paper places the slightest possible burden on the free exercise of religion \u2014 and exempts objectors from participating in conduct deemed sinful.\n\nThe Little Sisters and their fellows at the Supreme Court see the world very differently.\n\nBefore Obamacare, they provided employee health insurance. Like most plans at the time, theirs did not include contraception, let alone free contraception.\n\nThen came the government\u2019s order \u2014 plus the threat of huge fines if they refused to sign the paper that enabled the government to order their insurers to achieve the aim they consider sinful.\n\nEssentially, the Sisters believe that the administration is converting them from a private employer that exercises its faith every day to an agent of a government that, pardon the language, doesn\u2019t give a damn about their beliefs.\n\nThey are, in fact, correct that the administration places a higher value on universal free contraception than on strictures of faith with which it disagrees. Those it has cast aside much too facilely \u2014 even as the administration\u2019s lawyer acknowledged at the Supreme Court that the nuns sincerely believe the government seeks to force them to sin.\n\nThe administration\u2019s disregard for conscience comes into focus by considering its willingness to exempt many secular employers from the contraception mandate.\n\nBig corporations that provided substantial health coverage before Obamacare\u2019s enactment are exempt. Cities like New York are similarly off the hook. Also exempt are businesses with fewer than 50 workers.\n\nBut not people of clear, well-established conscience.\n\nA long time ago, Obama should have put the government into the business of directly providing contraception to any employee of a religious objector who applied for it. Instead, he\u2019s fighting for the right to tell American\u2019s of faith that the government can tell them which of their beliefs count. And that\u2019s the shame of the case.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Editorials", "twitter": {"description": "A nation founded on the principle that government will keep its hands off religion cannot command Catholic nuns to violate their beliefs.", "title": "Mercy for the Little Sisters of the Poor under Obamacare", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/mercy-sisters-poor-obamacare-article-1.2578268", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2578267.1458949615!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/0411-nuns-1b-jpg.jpg", "site": "@nydailynews", "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.tags": "little sisters, obamacare birth control, religion birth control, nuns battle obamacare,", "parsely-author": "Editorials", "parsely-type": "article", "keywords": "little sisters, obamacare birth control, religion birth control, nuns battle obamacare,", "nydn_tags": "obamacare, religion, supreme court, barack obama", "news_keywords": "little sisters, obamacare birth control, religion birth control, nuns battle obamacare,", "parsely-link": "http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/mercy-sisters-poor-obamacare-article-1.2578268", "parsely-title": "Mercy for the Little Sisters of the Poor under Obamacare", "sailthru.date": "2016-03-27T04:00:00-0400", "sailthru.title": "Mercy for the Little Sisters of the Poor under Obamacare", "nydn_section": "Opinion", "parsely-pub-date": "2016-03-27T08:00:00", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2578267.1458949615!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/0411-nuns-1b-jpg.jpg", "description": "A nation founded on the principle that government will keep its hands off religion cannot command Catholic nuns to violate their beliefs.", "robots": "NOARCHIVE", "fb": {"admins": 1594068001, "app_id": 107464888913, "pages": 268914272540}, "msvalidate.01": "02916AAC0DA8B068EFE01D721E03ED7E", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NYDailyNews/"}, "sailthru.description": "A nation founded on the principle that government will keep its hands off religion cannot command Catholic nuns to violate their beliefs.", "viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "parsely-section": "Opinion", "og": {"site_name": "NY Daily News", "description": "A nation founded on the principle that government will keep its hands off religion cannot command Catholic nuns to violate their beliefs.", "title": "Mercy for the Little Sisters of the Poor under Obamacare", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/mercy-sisters-poor-obamacare-article-1.2578268", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2578267.1458949615!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/0411-nuns-1b-jpg.jpg", "type": "article"}, "parsely-tags": "obamacare, religion, supreme court, barack obama", "parsely-image-url": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2578267.1458949615!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/0411-nuns-1b-jpg.jpg", "p": {"domain_verify": "78efe4f5c9935744af497772f68a0ee7"}, "nydn_byline": "Editorials", "sailthru.credits": "NEW YORK DAILY NEWS"}, "article_summary": "On Wednesday, the U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments about whether the dictates of Obamacare trample the conscience rights of the Little Sisters of the Poor and several other faith-based employers.\nLike most plans at the time, theirs did not include contraception, let alone free contraception.\nThe Little Sisters and their fellows at the Supreme Court see the world very differently.\nOBAMACARE IS REALLY GOOD, SAYS PRESIDENT OBAMARegulations that implemented President Obama\u2019s health insurance program require cost-free access to 20 pregnancy prevention measures.\nThey are, in fact, correct that the administration places a higher value on universal free contraception than on strictures of faith with which it disagrees."}
