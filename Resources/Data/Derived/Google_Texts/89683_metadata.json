Judge Reeves ordered the state to stop enforcing its anti-competition law against new moving businesses.\n\nThe anti-competition law essentially gave existing moving companies a veto over new firms. PLF attorneys challenged it on behalf of businessman Raleigh Bruner, who was the target of complaints to the government by existing companies \u2014 and state citations for violating the restriction against start-ups \u2014 after he opened his business in 2010.\n\nIn ruling against the anti-competition law and regulations, Judge Reeves today held that it is unconstitutional for government to favor some companies over others merely for the purpose of protecting existing businesses from competition.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s historic ruling is a victory for entrepreneurs, for consumers, and for the free enterprise principles embodied in the Constitution,\u201d said Timothy Sandefur, the Pacific Legal Foundation Principal Attorney who argued the case. \u201cAn outrageous roadblock to economic liberty and job creation has been taken down. While regulating for health and safety is permissible, regulating merely to benefit insiders over outsiders is illegitimate and downright wrong. Government can\u2019t build a wall around an industry and hang a \u2018keep out\u2019 sign on it, simply to exclude aspiring entrepreneurs and job-creators. As Judge Reeves recognized, the Constitution does not permit restrictions on business activity that are aimed purely at economic protectionism, limiting competition, and curtailing consumer choice.\u201d\n\nKentucky\u2019s cartel law allowed existing businesses to veto new competitors\n\nThe law at issue \u2014 called a Certificate of Necessity law (Kentucky Revised Statutes, section 281.615, et seq.) \u2014 essentially prohibited any person from going into the moving business without permission from existing moving companies. Any person who wanted to run a moving company had to obtain a certificate from the state\u2019s Division of Motor Carriers. But applicants were required to notify the state\u2019s existing moving companies and give them an opportunity to file a protest. Whenever a protest was filed, the start-up business owner was required to attend a public hearing and \u201cprove\u201d to the government that existing moving services were \u201cinadequate,\u201d that a new moving company would serve the \u201cpresent or future public convenience and necessity,\u201d and that the new license would be \u201cconsistent with the public interest.\u201d\n\nPursuing the American Dream: Raleigh Bruner, owner of Wildcat Moving\n\nRaleigh Bruner entered the moving business in 2010 after working as a waiter to put himself through the MBA program at the University of Kentucky. He started by advertising on craigslist.org, and now Wildcat Moving employs 36 people.\n\nWhen he started the business, Bruner was not aware that Kentucky law gave existing moving businesses the power to block his entry into the field. He learned of the law only when Lexington police officers cited him for operating without a Certificate of Necessity.\n\n\u201cIt was a shock to learn that Kentucky required new moving businesses like mine to be approved by other moving companies in order to serve the public,\u201d said Bruner. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the American way, and that\u2019s why I went to court \u2014 to defend my rights, and freedom for all entrepreneurs. I\u2019m grateful that Pacific Legal Foundation has successfully defended my constitutional rights \u2014 and the right of all entrepreneurs to provide honest services and choices for consumers.\u201d\n\nPLF\u2019s track record against moving-business cartels\n\nPLF\u2019s victory over Kentucky\u2019s Certificate of Necessity law follows its successful challenges to similar cartel rules for the moving business in Oregon and Missouri. In both those states, PLF\u2019s lawsuits prompted state lawmakers to repeal the restrictions on new moving businesses. PLF is also currently challenging Nevada\u2019s anti-competition law for the moving business.\n\nAbout Pacific Legal Foundation\n\nDonor-supported Pacific Legal Foundation (www.pacificlegal.org) is a legal watchdog organization that litigates for limited government, property rights, and free enterprise in courts nationwide.
