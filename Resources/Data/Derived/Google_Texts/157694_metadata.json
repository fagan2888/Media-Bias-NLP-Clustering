They were sitting next to a pile of suitcases, the telltale sign of an addict looking for a place to stay. Some get kicked out of their old halfway house because they relapse; others because their insurance coverage has been used up.\n\nThese kids, like hundreds or even thousands of others like them in Delray, are easy targets: They\u2019re often broke and far from home, with limited support from family and friends; they can be mentally and physically unstable; and they\u2019re frequently running from parole or pending court cases.\n\nThe people targeting them are variously called \u201cmarketers,\u201d \u201cbody brokers,\u201d and even \u201cjunkie hunters.\u201d They know addicts better than anyone (and many used to be addicts themselves). They spot kids dragging suitcases along the road and ask them if they need a place to go. Their phone numbers circulate in South Florida among the untold addicts looking for \u201cclean time\u201d \u2014 or those looking for a flop house that will let them get away with using drugs.\n\nIn the midst of a national opiate epidemic, politicians are talking a lot about addiction treatment. In February, Obama asked Congress for $1.1 billion in additional funding to combat opioid and heroin addiction. Hillary Clinton wants to increase addicts\u2019 access to treatment programs. Ted Cruz, whose sister died of an overdose, has mentioned counseling, Alcoholics Anonymous, and \u201csecuring the borders\u201d as solutions to the epidemic. But few if any of these public discussions address what \u201cgetting help\u201d actually looks like.\n\nIn South Florida\u2019s Delray Beach, home to hundreds of rehab facilities and halfway houses, scams abound to profit off of addicts and their insurance policies. The recent uptick in addicts adds energy to the hurricane, but the biggest driving force for the fraud is Obamacare and the 2008 Parity Act, which together give everyone access to private insurance that\u2019s legally bound to pay for rehab. \u201cMarketers\u201d act like headhunters, picking up addicts when they\u2019re down, then bringing them to rehab centers and halfway houses for a fee \u2014 usually about $500 per head.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of cynicism around because there\u2019s these headhunters that hang out at Starbucks and coffeehouses,\u201d said Harold Jonas, an addiction counselor who has run recovery-oriented businesses in South Florida for 25 years and was one of the first sober-home owners in Delray Beach. \u201cThey\u2019ll pay people to use because they get a $500-per-head fee to get them into detox.\u201d\n\nBecause the best way to milk insurance is to cycle addicts through detox, rehab, and outpatient programs, there\u2019s plenty of incentive to keep them relapsing. Five recovering addicts told BuzzFeed News that some marketers give their recruits money for drugs so they test positive on urine tests when checking into treatment.\n\n\u201cHe told me, \u2018You gotta be dirty to go to detox,\u2019\u201d one addict told BuzzFeed News, describing a marketer who gave him cash for drugs.\n\nThe FBI partnered with the state in 2014 on a task force investigating fraud in the $1 billion Florida recovery industry, resulting in at least two closures of addiction treatment businesses, as reported by the Palm Beach Post. But local law enforcement in South Florida isn\u2019t eager to take up the cause.\n\n\u201cThe patient brokering stuff, most of that is being handled by the federal government,\u201d Jeffrey Goldman, the chief of police of Delray Beach, told BuzzFeed News by phone. When the police do get a call, they hand it off to the feds.\n\n\n\nOutside of Starbucks Coffee on the busy street of Atlantic Avenue in Delray Beach, Florida. This coffee shop is a popular hangout spot for the rehab community. Alicia Vera for BuzzFeed News ID: 8244726\n\nByron Ira, a 45-year-old from Indiana who\u2019s recovering from drug addiction, shows how easily a brokered patient can become the broker.\n\n\n\nAfter going through rehab in his home state and relapsing, in November 2015 he contacted the HART Foundation, a nonprofit group that connects addicts with rehab centers. He then got a text, he says, from someone in the sales office of a rehab center in South Florida called C.A.R.E. Addiction Recovery, asking for his insurance information and some questions about his drug use.\n\n\u201cThe next call I got was flight information,\u201d he told BuzzFeed News. \u201cThe day after Thanksgiving, I got picked up at the Fort Lauderdale airport.\u201d\n\n(Mitchell Wallick, the executive director at C.A.R.E., said the facility only pays for patients\u2019 travel if they sign a promissory note promising to pay it back; Ira denies signing anything before his flight, though he notes it\u2019s possible he signed something during his intake once he was in Florida. He says he has never received a bill of any kind from C.A.R.E.)\n\nIra had googled the place ahead of his flight and was expecting a 12-step-based holistic center far from home where he could change his life. Instead, he spent most days at \u201cthe Center,\u201d an office building where addicts did group and individual therapy, but not based on the 12-step program. Nights were spent mostly back at the residence, a two-bedroom apartment housing four men.\n\nThe residence and the Center were understaffed and crowded. During his 23-day stay, Ira estimates he made it to only about five 12-step meetings outside the rehab center, because the staff didn\u2019t have access to enough vans to take the residents anywhere. (Wallick denied these allegations, saying that patients are taken to 12-step meetings every night.)\n\nShortly before Christmas, Ira\u2019s counselor at C.A.R.E. told him he was ready to rejoin life on the outside. But the doctor in charge of the counselors didn\u2019t want to hear it. Ira was told that if he chose to leave, despite his counselor\u2019s recommendation, it would be against medical advice.\n\nOut of the almost $22,000 the program charged Ira\u2019s insurance, they were only reimbursed $1,638.50. So Ira believes that they were trying to keep him another week in order to cover the cost of his flight. Wallick declined to confirm or deny that Ira was a patient, citing privacy laws.\n\nIra left the facility. A few weeks later, a man who Ira says was a patient at C.A.R.E. during his stay texted Ira with an offer. The former patient said he was making $1,500 for every insured addict he recruited to C.A.R.E. He invited Ira to join in recruiting patients, but Ira says he declined to participate.\n\n\u201cIf this is going on, there will be hell to pay,\u201d Wallick said about the brokering accusations. \u201cI would close that damn program down \u2014 pardon my French \u2014 before I would allow anything illegal or unethical to go down under my license or my name.\u201d\n\nIn Florida, the line between illegal patient brokering and legal marketing is simple, according to Jeffrey Lynne, a Delray Beach\u2013based lawyer who routinely represents businesses in the recovery industry. It\u2019s legal to pay someone a flat rate to market your treatment center by setting up an advertorial website, for example, or by recommending your center after doing an intervention.\n\nBut under the Florida Patient Brokering Act, paying a marketer a per-head fee for addicted patients, or offering any kind of financial incentive directly to an addict to entice them to pick your service, is a third-degree felony.\n\nNot that the law means much, given the way it\u2019s currently enforced. Law enforcement doesn\u2019t have the resources to track down these marketers, and prosecutors don\u2019t have the motivation to work hard for little payoff. \u201cIf you have a victim who\u2019s a co-conspirator with the marketer, how are you going to prove it?\u201d Lynne told BuzzFeed News. \u201cIt takes a lot of manpower to prosecute, and for what?\u201d\n\nThe victims \u2014 the addicts \u2014 become implicated in several ways, usually by getting free stuff in exchange for their insurance information.\n\nHalfway houses often set up addicts with in-kind kickbacks \u2014 like cell phones, grocery store gift cards, and free rent \u2014 if they agree to attend an affiliated outpatient program, a violation of the anti-brokering law. Halfway houses can\u2019t charge insurance companies for anything beyond a simple urine test, so they often partner with outpatient rehab centers that can charge hundreds of dollars a day for treatment services. The halfway house operators take an (illegal) cut of the profit in exchange for feeding patients to the outpatient programs, which covers the addict\u2019s rent \u2014 and more.\n\nJessica Bostic, a former heroin addict, texts her boyfriend at her halfway house in Lake Park, Florida. Alicia Vera for BuzzFeed News ID: 8244750\n\nSometimes an addict can earn a little extra cash as a \u201cmole,\u201d checking into another detox center or halfway house and recruiting patients away to their employer\u2019s programs.\n\nSteve, who has worked at several treatment centers in South Florida over the years and asked to not use his full name because speaking to the media would affect his employment, has seen this firsthand. While working as a behavioral health technician at a rehab center in Pompano Beach, Florida, a man came in for a short stint, known as a \u201ctwo-week stabilization.\u201d\n\nSteve noticed that he was very personable, chatting with everyone. A previous experience with a suspected mole had taught Steve to be wary, so one night after curfew he sat the new kid down and pressed him on whether he was being paid to steal patients away.\n\nThe kid broke and told him the details of the scam: For every person he convinced to leave, he\u2019d get a few hundred dollars. \u201cI said, \u2018Do you realize these guys have pimped you out?\u2019\u201d Steve said. \u201cIt\u2019s really easy to get people who are vulnerable and in need of money to say yes.\u201d\n\nGoldman, Delray Beach\u2019s chief of police, confirmed to BuzzFeed News that this is a problem. \u201cMoles are going in and they\u2019re trying to tell Johnny that this place is better,\u201d he said.\n\nBut not everybody wants to work for somebody else. It\u2019s easy for someone in early recovery to start eyeing the marketers\u2019 and owners\u2019 fancy cars and wads of cash and decide to make big deals of their own.\n\n\u201cPeople come in, within six days, they\u2019re counting how much money we\u2019re making,\u201d Jonas, the sober-home operator, told BuzzFeed News. \u201cThey get out six months later or less, and they\u2019re opening their own [house] \u2014 they\u2019re under 30 years old, they don\u2019t have any real recovery time.\u201d\n\nAnd the cash rolls in. \u201cYou sit on Atlantic, you watch the Lamborghinis and the Bugattis go by,\u201d Jonas said.\n\nA motorcycle drives by street art that reads \u201cLove Truth in Delray Beach\u201d. Alicia Vera for BuzzFeed News ID: 8296814\n\nSome marketers will pay the first few Obamacare insurance premiums for addicts they pick up off the street. According to Chris Harshbarger, who has lived in several sober homes in Palm Beach County, one such marketer is Jamal Boyd, the past owner of Ambitious Venture, a halfway house. (The house\u2019s Facebook page claims it\u2019s accredited by the Florida Association of Recovery Residences, which a spokesperson for FARR says is untrue. Boyd told BuzzFeed News he closed the house in February.)\n\nAround August of last year, according to Harshbarger (who is now in jail for an unrelated charge), Boyd offered to pay his insurance premium on a Cigna plan in order to place him in an outpatient program and halfway house that Boyd is affiliated with. He declined Boyd\u2019s offer, he says, and had trouble finding halfway houses that would let him live there without attending outpatient programs that would give the houses insurance kickbacks.\n\nBoyd told BuzzFeed News that Harshbarger\u2019s claims are the result of a personal beef. He said he offered Harshbarger technical assistance in choosing an insurance plan, but did not offer to pay his premiums. Boyd acknowledged that some \u201cother marketers\u201d do pay insurance premiums for addicts seeking treatment, but said that he refers clients who can\u2019t afford insurance to a nonprofit for assistance.\n\nBetween 2012 and 2014, while Boyd was living in halfway houses himself, he said, he did take per-head fees from marketers to refer his friends. \u201cThey tell the kids, OK, I get X amount of dollars if you can find people who need to go to detox,\u201d he said. \u201cThrough their commission, they would kick me back something like 50 or 100 bucks. The most I was getting paid was $250 for a 30-day treatment.\u201d\n\nBoyd opened the Ambitious Venture house in 2014. He told BuzzFeed News that clients who went to an affiliated outpatient program paid a lower weekly rent than those who didn\u2019t. He is a certified medical assistant, and he said those outpatient programs paid him between $150 and $250 a week to conduct \u201caftercare\u201d visits with their mutual clients.\n\nBoyd had trouble describing exactly what his aftercare services entailed. \u201cI basically just check on them and see how well they\u2019re doing \u2014 it\u2019s just a basic assessment,\u201d he told BuzzFeed News.\n\nThe kickbacks Harshbarger describes are a symptom of a much larger issue, one that is taking its toll on the Florida rehab industry\u2019s reputation. For instance, the mega-insurer Cigna, citing rampant health care fraud, pulled out of the Florida health care exchanges for 2016.\n\nOne woman, who requested to remain anonymous for fear of repercussions within the community, told BuzzFeed News about getting $250 a week to do an intensive outpatient program (IOP) in Delray. When her boyfriend, a marketer for the business, failed to bring enough new clients in, the owner cut them off. The woman contacted another marketer, who brought her to a new house.\n\n\u201cThey pretty much knew I was only there to get a cut,\u201d the woman told BuzzFeed News. But during her intake at the second house, she says, a doctor inappropriately touched her breasts and pulled down her underwear. A victim of previous sexual assaults, she panicked and demanded to leave.\n\n\u201cAfter that I told all the body brokers to stay the fuck away from me,\u201d she said. \u201cEven at this point if I relapsed, I would never go back into a halfway or into an IOP.\u201d\n\nMelissa Karnilaw, a flakka addict, approaches a car to ask if it\u2019s her ride to a treatment center. Alicia Vera for BuzzFeed News ID: 8244774\n\nThis layer of cash-only illegal activity creates cracks in the system, where lawbreakers (some with active drug problems) become the rich and powerful gatekeepers to treatment, housing, and even cash.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve heard it all \u2014 we\u2019ve even heard that these [halfway] houses, some of the bad operators are selling drugs in them,\u201d Jeffrey Goldman, the chief of police of Delray Beach, told BuzzFeed News in October.\n\nMarketers pull addicts off the street, said Jessica Bostic, a 26-year-old from Ohio who came to Delray last year for rehab. \u201cThere\u2019s a kickback if you\u2019re the person who signs them into detox for referral. I was offered to go into a [rehab center] for two weeks for $1,000 \u2014 they would give you a portion of the referral fee.\u201d But the marketers told her she would have to \u201cdo something\u201d to qualify for detox \u2014 that is, use drugs.\n\nWith addicts in such a vulnerable state, being offered money, drugs, or both, these marketers sometimes use their power to make sexual demands as well.\n\nBostic relapsed on and off for her first month in Florida. One day she overdosed on the beach where she\u2019d slept the night before. A friend revived her, took her to the hospital, and called Jameal Bost, a well-known marketer around Delray Beach. Bost knew Bostic was \u201crunning\u201d \u2014 still using \u2014 and looking for a safe place to stay.\n\nHe set up Bostic and her friend in Redemption House, a halfway house where Bost was a house manager. She overdosed again in the bathroom that night, and Bost helped revive her.\n\nAfter Bostic left Redemption, Bost sent her dozens of Facebook messages between July and September 2015, ranging from offers of cash to assistance in finding another halfway house. Once Bostic told the marketer she was not interested, he responded defensively:\n\n\u201clook girlfriend you\u2019re not my type nor on my level I have 15 months clean what would I [do] with u? What can you do for me I don\u2019t want you!!\u201d\n\n\u201cLol ok,\u201d Bostic responded. \u201cLater.\u201d\n\nThe next day Bost messaged her again, repeatedly asking her out and then getting angry when she told him to leave her alone. \u201cPisssssh you ain\u2019t no body [in] town but another junkie that don\u2019t want shit in life,\u201d he responded. \u201cU ow[e] me a big apologie but that\u2019s too good for u.\u201d\n\nJameal Bost / Via Facebook: jameal.bost.5 ID: 8244584\n\nBostic says a big part of the problem is how easy it is for addicts with very little clean time to suddenly start making big money selling people they know to rehab centers.\n\n\u201cEverybody needs to make money,\u201d she told BuzzFeed News. \u201cBut when you\u2019re in it for the money and you could give a shit less about the person, it\u2019s very dishonest.\u201d\n\nJessica Bostic, a former heroin addict, brushes her hair in her room at her halfway house in Lake Park, Florida. Alicia Vera for BuzzFeed News ID: 8244672\n\nBostic\u2019s story is not unique, according to Susan Ramsey, a West Palm Beach lawyer who often represents people in the recovery community in South Florida.\n\nShe knows of dozens of legal cases of sexual assault or misconduct throughout the recovery industry in South Florida, many involving techs or counselors having sex with residents.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t all bring cases \u2014in fact most of them don\u2019t,\u201d Ramsey told BuzzFeed News. \u201cFrankly, there\u2019s a double stigma \u2014 because people don\u2019t think drug addicts can be sexually assaulted, plus any time a woman says this, unless there\u2019s video, it\u2019s a problem.\u201d\n\nOne of Ramsey\u2019s clients, an alcoholic with a pending DUI case, was allegedly encouraged to drink by a technician at her halfway house, and then sexually assaulted by him. When she reported it, she was interrogated by the staff and forced to sign a written retraction. She left, and spent the night in a parking lot. The facility did not contact the police.\n\nSome members of the recovery industry even become pimps, like Kenny Chatman. The Palm Beach Post reported in December 2015 that Chatman, who ran several halfway houses in Palm Beach County, was actively pimping women out, getting them high and listing them on a local prostitution site. According the the police report, at least one woman was kept there against her will.\n\nFlorida has struggled to regulate the recovery industry. The last legislative session saw several laws passed, including one that says rehab centers can only refer clients to halfway houses certified by the Florida Association of Recovery Residences to meet a certain standard. There are many people in South Florida who are honestly trying to help addicts recover, and follow strict codes of ethics around how to behave.\n\nBut legal experts say relying on goodwill isn\u2019t enough. The Florida Department of Children and Families (DCF), the body tasked with regulating rehab and detox centers, is woefully underfunded, they say, and doesn\u2019t have staff to enforce its own regulations. And it doesn\u2019t have any power over halfway houses.\n\nLynne, the Delray Beach lawyer, hates when his clients ask him what the risk is if they engage in illegal marketing. \u201cI can only tell you what I know to be true \u2014 there is no DCF police out there, there\u2019s no DCF money out there, and the police aren\u2019t prosecuting,\u201d he told BuzzFeed News. \u201cIt does violate the law. But they come to me and say, \u2018Jeff, if I don\u2019t do it, I can\u2019t even be in the game.\u2019\u201d\n\nDCF says it reports all alleged patient brokering to the attorney general, but otherwise has no power to do anything about it.\n\n\u201cDCF does not deny patient brokering exists,\u201d Michelle Glady, the agency\u2019s press secretary, told BuzzFeed News by email. \u201cDCF does not have legal authority to investigate patient brokering and can only legally revoke a license if minimum standards are not met.\u201d\n\nUltimately, the worst problems may come from the fact that so many addicts are searching for recovery in a place where drugs \u2014 and their consequences \u2014 are easy to find and hard to avoid.\n\n\u201cPeople die every week,\u201d Bostic, the 26-year-old from Ohio, said.\n\nAnd they\u2019re not just dying in Delray Beach. Nationwide, 125 people die of drug overdoses every day. Politicians pay lip service to \u201cevidence-based treatment.\u201d But the truth is, nobody knows the best way to get an addict off drugs.\n\nThere are few numbers on how many addicts get clean in rehab, and even fewer on how many stay clean. By nature, it\u2019s a transient population, difficult to track for the multiple years required to get solid evidence of efficacy. And there\u2019s little incentive for rehab centers to shine a light on relapse rates, which likely hover around 90%.\n\nCarrie Schoewe, a 41-year-old originally from Ohio who got sober in South Florida, told BuzzFeed News she thinks that short stays in sober homes can be beneficial, but that many get trapped in the cycle of relapsing with other addicts in early recovery.\n\n\u201cI think for a small period of time, people who understand where you are and what you\u2019ve been through can be really supportive,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not staying stuck in a place, it\u2019s what you do after. And there don\u2019t seem to be afters for a lot of people.\u201d\n\nID: 8245425\n\n8. Pee Scams, Kickbacks, And Overdoses Plague South Florida Rehabs buzzfeed.com ID: 8245433\n\n9.
