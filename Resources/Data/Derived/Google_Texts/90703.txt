The battle over the House heats up as Congress swears in new members and nothing is getting to the headlines like the movement to remove John Boehner.

FreedomWorks lists the “worst” of the Boehner votes:

“Boehner opposed a full repeal of ObamaCare, the most destructive single law to American liberty in recent memory…Boehner opposed a bill to stop the IRS from targeting individuals based on their political beliefs, such as when the agency disproportionately targeted conservative non-profits before the 2012 elections…Boehner opposed a one-year delay of the ObamaCare individual mandate that is hurting millions of Americans.”

The group, touting a strong mission towards increased liberty, points out Boehner not supporting movements to stop the NSA monitoring, auditing the Fed and stopping the EPA’s overreach on water.

“Boehner supported the more than $1 trillion spending bill crafted in secret behind closed doors…Boehner opposed the REINS Act, a bill that would have required a vote in Congress for any major new regulation.”
