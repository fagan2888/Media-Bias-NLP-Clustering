In 2009, the family acquired the Roseberry Rolle manuscript, which started the Green Collection. Today, they are in possession of one of the world\u2019s largest private collections of rare biblical artifacts, which will be housed inside the museum.\n\n\u201cMost museums have a very focused group looking to attract. We learned that we don\u2019t,\u201d Museum of the Bible\u2019s President Cary Summers said.\n\nTraveling exhibits of biblical artifacts in Israel, Jerusalem, Cuba and Italy showed that there is a big and wide group of interest in the Bible. It cannot be pinpointed to one narrow demographic. All age groups, races and ethnicities feel a connection to the Bible, as showcased by the hundreds of thousands of people that have viewed the exhibits (165,000 from 125 countries in an exhibit in Rome alone), Summers said.\n\n\n\n\n\nMuseum of the Bible president Cary Summers.

The traveling exhibits, although a great supplement, are not enough.\n\n\u201cA museum is very broad. It is a lot of square feet and many stories. While the traveling exhibits represent a portion of the history of the Bible, a museum includes history, impact and narrative,\u201d Summers said.\n\nIt is all one neat package in the heart of the District. The Museum will reach those that the traveling exhibits cannot, and vice versa.\n\nThe Museum of the Bible will be the anchor, while the traveling exhibits will be the buoys, bobbing along the sea in various places. Those that cannot attend the museum will hopefully be able to catch the exhibits.\n\nPaying homage to the impact, history and narrative of the Bible, the museum will not only display the artifacts, but will also take visitors through the history of the development of the Bible \u2013 starting with Jewish roots and showing how and why it spread. In addition, a high school Bible curriculum for both domestic and international use will be created to support learning.\n\n\u201cOnly several millions of people will see the museum But hundreds of millions will not,\u201d Summer said. \u201cEducation is a global and universal desire, and we are simply answering the call of the global market.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Museum of the Bible\u2019s Impact floor.

Under the June 30 ruling, owners of closely-held, profit-making corporations cannot be forced under the Affordable Care Act to provide their employees with certain kinds of contraceptives that offend their religious beliefs.\n\n\u201cTypically, one always gets negative blogs and people making jokes,\u201d Summers said. \u201cBut we have not. It has been quite amazing. And I think one of the reasons is that we have such a broad contingency of scholars and other institutions that are working with us.\u201d\n\nThe traveling exhibit Passages offers a student discount, so there is hope for students watching their pennies with cost of admission to the Museum of the Bible.\n\nThe museum is set to open its doors in 2017.
