The complexity of balancing individual liberties with the promise of security notwithstanding, the Obama administration might try to soften the government\u2019s image by touting another collective benefit of such intelligence gathering \u2014 early warning for infectious disease outbreaks.\n\nWhereas traditional disease surveillance may take weeks to identify an outbreak, the collection of signals intelligence, as well as something much less sinister \u2014 totally legal analysis of Google searches \u2014 allows the government to potentially predict future epidemics. Rather than analyzing doctor reports over time, public health authorities might glean real-time information about disease outbreaks, offering the ability to forecast such events like the weather.\n\nDr. Wenbiao Hu, an investigator from Queensland University of Technology in Australia, told reporters last week that spikes in online searches for infectious diseases might predict outbreaks of disease, an idea long touted by academics in the United States and elsewhere. \u201cThis is because traditional surveillance relies on the patient recognizing the symptoms and seeking treatment before diagnosis, along with the time taken for health professionals to alert authorities through their health networks,\u201d Hu said, according to Business Standard. \u201cIn contrast, digital surveillance can provide real-time detection of epidemics.\u201d\n\nBy analyzing online searches, scientists might have predicted the 2005-2006 avian influenza epidemic a week or two ahead of official reports that used traditional means. \u201cIn another example, a digital data collection network was found to be able to detect the SARS outbreak more than two months before the first publication by the World Health Organization,\u201d Hu said. \u201cEarly detection means early warning and that can help reduce or contain an epidemic, as well as alert public health authorities to ensure risk management strategies, such as the provision of adequate medication, are implemented.\u201d\n\nInvestigators next want to incorporate more forms of digital media into the analysis, including social media platforms such as Twitter. \u201cThere is the potential for digital technology to revolutionize emerging infectious disease surveillance,\u201d Hu said. \u201cWhile this study has looked at the effectiveness of digital surveillance systems retrospectively, Australia is well-placed to take the lead in developing a real-time infectious disease warning surveillance system.\u201d\n\nHu and his colleagues published a paper in November in The Lancet Diseases describing how increasing numbers of emerging diseases might be countered with the new growth of mass digital surveillance. \u201cThe increase in emerging infectious diseases has led to calls for new technologies and approaches for detection, tracking, reporting, and response. Internet-based surveillance systems offer a novel and developing means of monitoring conditions of public health concern, including emerging infectious diseases,\u201d Hu and his team wrote. Although many Americans remain leery of mass surveillance, government health officials expect to make increasingly greater use of mass data.\n\nSource: Milinovich GJ, Williams GM, Clements AC, Hu W.
