There are about 7,000 such diseases, mostly genetic disorders.\n\n\n\nRaskin said the ACA requirement that insurers cover people regardless of pre-existing conditions, removal of the lifetime cap on health insurance expenses and Medicaid expansion are all big steps.\n\n\n\nBut panelists, including doctors, patient advocates and government and life science industry representatives, said diagnosis of rare diseases still lag while affordability problems persist.\n\n\n\nBecause rare diseases require special care, advocates say patients need access to more expansive networks that go beyond a single state's borders. But Raskin said many people ineligible for government subsidies can't afford \"platinum\" and \"gold\" level plans that provide broader access. She would like to see the ACA make specific provisions for the rare disease population.\n\n\n\n\"My vision is people with rare disease should be coded,\" said Raskin, also the executive director of Congenital Hyperinsulinism International.\n\n\n\nThen there are reimbursement questions.\n\n\n\nJayne Gershkowitz, a vice president with the Cranbury-based Amicus Therapeutics, noted that because many rare diseases lack treatments, patients rely on doctors to prescribe other medications off-label to manage symptoms. That is common with Tay-sachs, a nervous system disease, she said.\n\n\n\nGershkowitz said reimbursements pose a problem as people get shifted from one insurance plan to another under the ACA. To avoid such uncertainty, advocates hope to see more a comprehensive array of drugs covered.\n\n\n\nDr. Tanya Pagan Raggio-Ashley, a medical officer with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, called the ACA a \"living law\" subject to ongoing modification.\n\n\n\n\"It has to keep being revisited,\" she said. \"That's a very important component.\"\n\n\n\nPlus, diagnosis of rare diseases can take years. Dr. Swati Sather, a neurology specialist at St. Joseph's Medical Center, said Pompe disease, an often fatal disorder that disables heart and skeletal muscles, takes eight years on average to diagnose among adults.\n\n\n\nThe federal government provides incentives for companies to develop drugs \u2014 called orphan drugs \u2014 including tax breaks and grant eligibility to encourage breakthroughs on rare diseases.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "NJBIZ", "description": "Despite inroads made by the Affordable Care Act to improve prospects for people struggling with rare diseases, patient advocates say much work remains.", "title": "ACA not a cure-all for patients with rare diseases, experts say | NJBIZ", "url": "http://www.njbiz.com/article/20131211/NJBIZ01/131219915/aca-not-a-cureall-for-patients-with-rare-diseases-experts-say", "image": "http://www.njbiz.com/images/njbiz-logo-share.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "njbiz.com", "description": "Despite inroads made by the Affordable Care Act to improve prospects for people struggling with rare diseases, patient advocates say much work remains.", "title": "ACA not a cure-all for patients with rare diseases, experts say | NJBIZ", "image": {"src": "http://www.njbiz.com/images/njbiz-logo-share.jpg"}, "site": "@njbiz", "card": "summary"}, "description": "Despite inroads made by the Affordable Care Act to improve prospects for people struggling with rare diseases, patient advocates say much work remains.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Because rare diseases require special care, advocates say patients need access to more expansive networks that go beyond a single state's borders.\nDespite inroads made by the Affordable Care Act to improve prospects for people struggling with rare diseases, patient advocates say much work remains.\nThe federal government provides incentives for companies to develop drugs \u2014 called orphan drugs \u2014 including tax breaks and grant eligibility to encourage breakthroughs on rare diseases.\nPlus, diagnosis of rare diseases can take years.\nShe would like to see the ACA make specific provisions for the rare disease population."}
