He has the Phoenix fall race three years in a row, also won at the track in March and has a record six victories on the mile oval.\n\nNow he takes Stewart-Haas Racing into the championship race next Sunday at Homestead-Miami Speedway, where the four championship contenders will all be seeking their first Sprint Cup title. Harvick came into Sunday ranked eighth in the eight-driver Chase field.\n\n\u201cWow, I guess that\u2019s what it feels like to hit a walkoff in the extra innings,\u201d Harvick said.\n\nGordon finished second, but lost his bid for a fifth Sprint Cup championship when Newman knocked Kyle Larson into the wall on the final lap to finish 11th \u2014 and one point ahead of Gordon.\n\nDenny Hamlin, the points leader after finishing fifth, and Joey Logano also advanced. The title will be decided by finishing order among the final four at Homestead.\n\nFailing to advance with Gordon were Brad Keselowski, Matt Kenseth and Carl Edwards.\n\nLogano finished third, Keselowski was fourth and Edwards 15th.\n\nNewman\u2019s move on Larson in the final turn made for a stunning shakeup in the points. Winless on the season, his first with Richard Childress Racing, he was aggressive with his pass of Larson to knock Gordon out of the finale.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t take him out,\u201d Newman said. \u201cIn a day or two, he\u2019ll understand. It\u2019s hard to rationalize that, but I did what I had to do. I don\u2019t like racing that way.\u201d\n\nGordon, a four-time winner this season and the points leader for most of the year, was denied a chance to race for his fifth title.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m disappointed, I thought if we came out of here second, even if it was to Kevin or Brad, I thought we\u2019d still make it in,\u201d Gordon said. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty disappointing to do all of that and it just makes last week that much more disappointing. I\u2019m going to be thinking about that one for a while.\u201d\n\nGordon was in position to win at Texas last week until a late caution forced the field into a restart that went bad when Keselowski tried to wedge his car into a small hole and ended up making contact with Gordon. He got a flat tire, spun and finished 29th to fall from first to fourth in the standings.\n\nStill, he doesn\u2019t blame Newman for doing what he had to do to get into the finale.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the system we have,\u201d Gordon said.\n\nIt was a devastating blow for Keselowski, who leads the series this season with six wins and won a race in each of the first two rounds of the Chase. But he fell into a hole because of a mechanical problem at Martinsville in the first event of this three-race round that he couldn\u2019t recover from despite strong finishes at Texas and Phoenix.\n\nHis mettle was definitely tested, too, as his aggressive driving style angered his competitors and led to two fights in four races. He was fined $50,000 for his post-race behavior at Charlotte last month \u2014 actions that caused Kenseth to jump him from behind in the garage \u2014 and he and Gordon were both bloodied when the drivers and the teams brawled on pit road after last week\u2019s race at Texas.\n\n\u201cWe gave it all we had, it was a strong run, it just wasn\u2019t enough to advance,\u201d Keselowski said. \u201cWe did everything but win. We broke down in Martinsville and it was a huge hurdle to overcome and it was probably going to take a win. Fourth wasn\u2019t going to be enough, and we knew that coming in.\u201d\n\nHamlin, who came to Phoenix tied with Logano for the points lead, won the pole and needed only to finish 11th or better to guarantee himself a spot in the finale.\n\nBut a broken valve stem caused his right rear tire to go flat under caution immediately after the first round of pit stops. Hamlin had to pit a second time, went from fourth to 35th on the restart, and sounded panicky as he struggled to regain his lost positions.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying, man, I\u2019m trying,\u201d he radioed.\n\n\u201cTen-4 buddy, you don\u2019t have to get it all back this run,\u201d crew chief Darian Grubb replied.\n\nHe went a lap down with 236 laps remaining in the race.\n\nLogano took a hit when he was penalized for pulling out of his pit stall with the fuel can still attached to his car. He went from second to 26thon a restart with 185 laps remaining.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll recover from this,\u201d crew chief Todd Gordon said.\n\nIt put him and Hamlin in the middle of the pack at the same time, and the two waged a furious battle to put themselves in position to be the driver to earn a free pass back onto the lead lap. Hamlin aggressively went three-wide on a restart to pass Logano and take the position, but Logano eventually passed him and was rewarded when the caution came out with 111 laps remaining.\n\nBoth drivers battled back from a lap down twice and now cruise into Homestead with a title in reach.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m playing with house money now,\u201d Hamlin said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Harvick led 264 laps at Phoenix International Raceway on Sunday to earn an automatic spot next week in the four-man Chase field in the finale at Homestead.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Harvick led 264 laps at Phoenix International Raceway on Sunday to earn an automatic spot next week in the four-man Chase field in the finale at Homestead.", "title": "Kevin Harvick rolls to Phoenix win; Jeff Gordon out of Chase", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/nov/9/kevin-harvick-rolls-phoenix-win-jeff-gordon-out-ch/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/11/09/nascar-phoenix-auto-r_lanc1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/11/09/nascar-phoenix-auto-r_lanc1.jpg", "description": "Harvick led 264 laps at Phoenix International Raceway on Sunday to earn an automatic spot next week in the four-man Chase field in the finale at Homestead.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Kevin Harvick rolls to Phoenix win; Jeff Gordon out of Chase"}, "Author": "Jenna Fryer", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Jeff Gordon, Joey Logano, Denny Hamlin, Ryan Newman"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbd2e\"", "article_summary": "AVONDALE, Ariz. \u2014 Kevin Harvick dominated a race he had to win to advance to the final round of NASCAR\u2019s playoffs, while Jeff Gordon was knocked out when Ryan Newman completed a last-lap pass.\nHarvick led 264 laps at Phoenix International Raceway on Sunday to earn an automatic spot next week in the four-man Chase field in the finale at Homestead.\n\u201cWow, I guess that\u2019s what it feels like to hit a walkoff in the extra innings,\u201d Harvick said.\nDenny Hamlin, the points leader after finishing fifth, and Joey Logano also advanced.\nFailing to advance with Gordon were Brad Keselowski, Matt Kenseth and Carl Edwards."}
