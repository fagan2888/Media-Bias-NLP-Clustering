They cut five trees that were deemed unhealthy from that area.\n\n\"While the tree that fell and struck the driver was not in the Department\u2019s right-of-way, NJDOT officials felt it was imperative to remove any trees that pose a potential hazard to drivers,\" said Kevin Israel, NJDOT spokesman, in an email.\n\nBuy Photo The scene of a fatal accident along Route 34 in Colt Neck is shown Tuesday, October 6, 2015.

COSTELLO)\n\nAfter they cleared the first set of trees, crews identified others farther down on Route 34 on NJDOT property that needed to be cut down. Workers marked nearly two dozen Tulip Poplars and Ailanthus trees to remove.\n\nThe Tulip Poplar that killed Weathers had rotted, Police Chief Kevin A. Sauter told the Press. It also damaged a guard rail on the highway.\n\nBuy Photo The scene of a fatal accident along Route 34 in Colt Neck is shown Tuesday, October 6, 2015.

COSTELLO)\n\nA second tree fell in the early hours of Oct. 14 across the street from where Weathers was killed near Clover Hill Road, Sauter said. Officers shut down the roadway for an hour and dragged the tree out of the way with a department military vehicle, until crews from NJDOT and Jersey Central Power & Light arrived.\n\nIsrael said NJDOT does not have an arborist and he could not determine what made the trees unhealthy, but confirmed the damage was not storm-related.\n\nSteph Solis: 732-643-4043; ssolis@gannettnj.com\n\nDon't miss a thing Download our apps and get alerts for local news, weather, traffic and more.
