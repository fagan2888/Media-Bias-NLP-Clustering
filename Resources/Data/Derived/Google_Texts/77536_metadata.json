LeBron James proved as much by carrying his team into five of the last seven NBA Finals. What\u2019s going to make this quest for a championship in Cleveland the best sports story out there for some time is that he\u2019s committed to try and tip the balance of power by himself, if need be, to pay back all those folks who nurtured him from the start.\n\n\u201cMy goal is still to win as many titles as possible, no question. But what\u2019s most important for me is bringing one trophy back to Northeast Ohio,\u201d James said in a Sports Illustrated first-person story published Friday announcing his decision to return to the Cavaliers.\n\n\u201cI always believed that I\u2019d return to Cleveland and finish my career there. I just didn\u2019t know when,\u201d he said.\n\nHad James delayed the announcement much longer, the army of in-studio analysts and on-scene reporters deployed by every media outlet on the planet would need catheters to stay on the job. If nothing else, that part of our long national nightmare is over. So what\u2019s worth saying after everything that\u2019s already been said?\n\nJust that the next chapter in James\u2019 story will turn out to be worth every penny \u2014 if not quite every word \u2014 that\u2019s been lavished on him.\n\nGoing back home to try and win a championship after what some of his neighbors put him through takes real guts. It\u2019s what plenty of us wanted James to do the first time around: Behave like a real king: Dig in his heels and redouble his effort to patch the cracks in the foundation of a Cavaliers franchise that spent more than seven seasons and hundreds of millions trying to build him a throne.\n\nThat\u2019s the way Michael Jordan, Larry Bird, Magic Johnson and Kobe Bryant got their championship rings. We even held out hope at the time that James might give the Cavs a hometown discount, taking less money than he was worth to free up cap space down the road, the way Tim Duncan has done more than once.\n\nNo disrespect to what James accomplished in Miami: two NBA titles, two Finals MVPs and two more regular-season MVPs, among others. But it will be even better when he wins another one this way.\n\n\u201cIt will be a long process, much longer than it was in 2010,\u201d he wrote in SI. \u201cMy patience will get tested. I know that. I\u2019m going into a situation with a young team and a new coach. I will be the old head. But I get a thrill out of bringing a group together and helping them reach a place they didn\u2019t know they could go.\u201d\n\nParse the entire statement if you want. But everything you need to know is in those last two sentences.\n\nWhen James announced the original decision in 2010, no athlete in history ever held so much sway over his sport without winning a title first. The only thing he could rightly claim to be the king of was hype, hypocrisy and stacking the deck by lighting out for South Beach to join superfriends Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh. A few of his tattoos \u2014 \u201cLoyalty\u201d and \u201c330\u201d (the Akron, Ohio, area code) \u2014 made a mockery of his words even as they spilled out of his mouth.\n\nHe\u2019d been trying so hard to please the various constituencies he\u2019d acquired since coming into the league that you wondered whether James even knew what he really wanted.\n\nBut the LBJ who returns four years later is a much different cat.\n\nFor all the grief he\u2019s caught in the four years since, James has been a model citizen throughout \u2014 poised, polite, accessible, generous with his time and money, durable \u2014 and he plays hard every night. He went to Miami four years ago because it would be easier to win a title. He returns to Cleveland knowing exactly how hard it will be. If you want to call that maturity, and put that quality at the top of the list, you\u2019ll get no argument here.\n\n___\n\nJim Litke is a national sports columnist for The Associated Press.
