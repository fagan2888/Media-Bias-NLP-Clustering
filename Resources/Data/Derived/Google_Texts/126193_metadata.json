In the Sentinel story, the First Amendment Foundation said the radio station should be protected by the shield law that applies to media organizations.\n\nAtwater issued the subpoena at the request of attorneys for FSU, according to Deslatte's story.\n\nThe story that started all this was \"Groups Unaffiliated With 'ObamaCare' Try to Cash In,\" which was aired and posted on Oct. 24. It said that a group calling itself \"The Obamacare Enrollment Team,\" which made a presentation at a Tallahassee church, appeared instead to represent private insurance agents.
