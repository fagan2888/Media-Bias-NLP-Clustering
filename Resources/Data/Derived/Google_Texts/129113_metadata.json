NIAID, CC BY 2.0\n\nThree years ago, a team of doctors at Johns Hopkins Children's Center was able to successfully treat a 2-year-old child who came down with a dangerous and drug-resistant form of tuberculosis (TB). Now, they\u2019re hoping that their retelling of the ordeal, published in the December issue of The Lancet Infectious Diseases, can provide medical providers a future road map toward treating this increasingly more prevalent version of the bacterial disease, particularly in children.\n\n\"We are thrilled that our patient is doing so well,\" said study author and Johns Hopkins Children's Center pediatrician Dr. Sanjay Jain in a statement. \"But at the same time, this is a wake-up call to the realities of TB.\"\n\n'Infinitely More So'\n\nThe child in question came to Johns Hopkins with a persistent fever and pneumonia soon after spending three months in India, a country sporting some of the largest rates of TB, according to a 2015 report by the World Health Organization. Despite initially testing negative, the doctors decided to begin treatment for TB, caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The doctors went with their hunch because of a lung spot found on the child\u2019s chest X-ray, which is considered a possible marker of TB.\n\nAccording to Jain, false negatives often happen in children because they carry a relatively low level of the bacteria in their system compared to adults, highlighting a shortfall of the current detection approach for pediatric TB. \u201cPreliminary test results are notoriously unreliable and this case provides a perfect illustration of the need for swifter and more reliable techniques,\u201d Jain said. It would take a month before further tests were able to confirm her positive status.\n\nThough the child improved at first after being given a conventional antibiotic regimen, lab tests 12 weeks later eventually revealed that they carried a strain of TB known as extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB). Almost as if on cue, the child\u2019s condition began to deteriorate again upon the doctors\u2019 discovery, with signs of lung tissue damage. XDR-TB is a rare variant of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), with strains capable of deterring four of the most commonly used TB drugs (MDR-TB only resists two). It\u2019s believed by the WHO that 9 percent of the 650,000 cases of MDR-TB estimated to occur at any time are XDR-TB.\n\nWhile both forms are nowadays a known danger of TB infection, the appearance of XDR-TB in so young a child presented unprepared challenges to the medical team. \u201cDrug-resistant TB is a daunting disease to diagnose and treat in anyone, but in a child, it is infinitely more so,\u201d noted co-author Dr. Nicole Salazar-Austin, also a fellow in pediatric infectious disease at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine\n\nIn order to combat the child\u2019s XDR-TB, the John Hopkins doctors placed the child on a heavy-duty regimen of five different drugs combined with the vitamin B-6. Rather than rely on the child\u2019s physical symptoms as a guiding post for how they were responding to treatment, Jain and his colleagues turned to child-friendly, low-dose CT-scans instead, a method they now advocate as essential. \u201cIn the absence of reliable biomarkers for pediatric TB, the acute need for rapid readouts of treatment response and the dangers of treatment failure, we felt a CT scan was our best option,\u201d he said.\n\nThe scans allowed the doctors to navigate through the child\u2019s TB infection in real time, and slowly but surely, they were able to send the child into remission. Now, at age 5, the doctors are optimistic that the TB has been permanently purged from the child\u2019s body, though they will continue to monitor the child (and a sibling) for the next two years just to be safe.\n\n\u201cMany factors made this a challenging case, including how physicians would monitor on a timely basis whether the drugs had reduced or eliminated the bacteria,\u201d commented Dr. Antonio Sastre, program director at the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering. \u201cThe effective use of CT monitoring was first shown in the laboratory, with mice, and low-radiation CT imaging has provided a readily translatable solution for this case.\u201d\n\nAn accompanying editorial in The Lancet Infectious Diseases noted that while the worldwide prevalence of TB has steadily decreased since 2000, the resources needed to effectively and globally fight the disease, one of the three major cause of deaths via infectious disease alongside HIV and malaria, are still in short supply. \u201cTuberculosis is already \u2014 and has long been \u2014 a major problem within high-income countries,\u201d the authors of the editorial wrote. \u201cSimply put, it's time to end impotent calls for action; the demand now is for nothing less than success.\u201d\n\nSource: Salazar-Austin N, Ordonez A, Hsu A, et al.
