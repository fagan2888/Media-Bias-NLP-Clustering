Others have begun to notice, too, especially in the UK after David Cameron\u2019s resounding victory, preceded by predictions of doom from the media. For instance, the British Polling Council wants to conduct an investigation into how the UK pollsters got the call so badly wrong:\n\nPolling organisations announce inquiry into accuracy of polls during #GE2015 campaign http://t.co/eXyXVSvVsB pic.twitter.com/DWZ5NJIXji \u2014 BBC Breaking News (@BBCBreaking) May 8, 2015\n\nDavid Axelrod, who worked on behalf of Labour (while Jim Messina worked for the Tories), also thinks that UK pollsters have some \u2018splaining to do:\n\nIn all my years as journalist & strategist, I've never seen as stark a failure of polling as in UK. Huge project ahead to unravel that. \u2014 David Axelrod (@davidaxelrod) May 8, 2015\n\nIt\u2019s not just a problem in the UK, though. US pollsters and media organizations have blown calls here too, and poll aggregator Nate Silver says that it\u2019s time to \u201cworry about the state of the polling industry\u201d:\n\nLater in the evening, Silver added:\n\nOur pre-election forecast, put together in conjunction with electionforecast.co.uk, did project a narrow Conservative plurality. And it was about in line with or slightly more bullish on the Conservatives than other forecasts and betting markets. However, that\u2019s not much of an excuse. The forecast assigned too little of a chance to an outcome like this one, especially given that there have been significant polling errors in the U.K. before. It\u2019s a good lesson as we begin to plan our coverage for the 2016 U.S. election.\n\nPolitico\u2019s Dylan Byers wondered whether Silver had talked himself out of his niche:\n\nThis is quite a notable statement. The former New York Times statistician gained national fame for correctly anticipating the outcome of the 2008, 2010 and 2012 U.S. elections. He did this largely by understanding how to read the polls, and by knowing which polls were worth reading. \u2026 If Silver is declaring that the world has a polling problem, and that there may be more difficult times ahead for the polling industry, what is Silver\u2019s added value in an election cycle? His ability to forecast elections is largely dependent on the accuracy of polling. Without that, what is his raison d\u2019etre \u2014 other than to point out how bad polling caused him to make inaccurate forecasts?\n\nIt sounds more like Silver wants to preserve his niche. Bad polling and \u201cherding\u201d make his job much more difficult, especially the latter. Speaking out for reform may at first make it difficult to explain his analyses and projections without demonstrating some significant nod to the uncertainty in the polling industry, but the polls for 2016 now are nearly meaningless anyway, even if they\u2019re hyper-accurate. The polling industry won\u2019t get any better if those who rely on it just keep their mouths shut about its problems, as the string of examples Silver uses demonstrates.\n\nConsumers of news and especially the analysts have to challenge pollsters to improve their batting average, and sooner rather than later. Otherwise, Silver and others like him will have nothing to add to Election Nights except to continue to recap the industry\u2019s failures \u2014 as necessary as that may be.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "BBC: Polling council to open probe into #GE2015 surveys.", "title": "Nate Silver, David Axelrod agree: Yes, there is a crisis in polling", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2015/05/08/nate-silver-yes-there-is-a-crisis-in-polling/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@EdMorrissey"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "keywords": "Dylan Byers, Nate Silver, polls, pollster, UK,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-08T16:41:34+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-08T21:21:07+00:00"}, "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "article_summary": "His ability to forecast elections is largely dependent on the accuracy of polling.\nBad polling and \u201cherding\u201d make his job much more difficult, especially the latter.\n\u2026 If Silver is declaring that the world has a polling problem, and that there may be more difficult times ahead for the polling industry, what is Silver\u2019s added value in an election cycle?\nThe polling industry won\u2019t get any better if those who rely on it just keep their mouths shut about its problems, as the string of examples Silver uses demonstrates.\nWithout that, what is his raison d\u2019etre \u2014 other than to point out how bad polling caused him to make inaccurate forecasts?"}
