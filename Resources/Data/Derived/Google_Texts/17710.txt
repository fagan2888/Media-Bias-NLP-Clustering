There were a number of potential firsts from the floor of the U.S. Senate this week, to include a reading of Dr.Suess’s “Green Eggs and Ham” and a Darth Vader impersonation, but these incidents take a backseat to what may be the first use of the term “tea baggers.”

U.S. Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., called into MSNBC’s “Andrea Mitchell Reports” from the floor Friday after a vote for cloture to move forward with the resolution to fund government, using the vile term to attack tea party members who didn’t support funding Obamacare.

In pointing to U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, host Andrea Mitchell asked why the vote was delayed from taking place Thursday and Mikulski replied:

“The reason Ted Cruz stood up and asked for a delay is so that he could have a vote during today when he’s… the teabaggers in his tea party were going to watch.”

“Tea bagger” is a slang term that describes a crude sexual act.

Lest we forget, according to the media, the negative discourse in American politics originates with the tea party. Got it?

Looking past the disdain and hatred behind her comments, Mikulski seems to share the concerns of U.S. Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn, that Americans might actually be paying attention to their actions — which proves bipartisanship is not entirely dead in Washington, D.C.
