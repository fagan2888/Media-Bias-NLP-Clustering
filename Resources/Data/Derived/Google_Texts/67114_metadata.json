Because when the Focus was introduced, it didn't just improve on the stodgy looks and driving dynamics of the Escort it replaced.\n\n' It redefined what customers should expect from an affordable hatchback. Even today, it is a very comfortable car.'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "news_keywords": "Humble,Ford,Focus,beats,host,glamorous,supercars,named,greatest,vehicle,past,25,years", "original-source": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2408684/Humble-Ford-Focus-beats-host-glamorous-supercars-named-greatest-vehicle-past-25-years.html", "doc-class": "Living Document", "twitter": {"description": "The car, which can be bought for as little as \u00a3500 today, has been a hit with families and petrol heads since it was launched by Ford in 1998.", "title": "Humble Ford Focus beats host of glamorous supercars to be named the greatest vehicle of the past 25 years", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2408684/Humble-Ford-Focus-beats-host-glamorous-supercars-named-greatest-vehicle-past-25-years.html", "app": {"id": {"ipad": 400442503, "iphone": 384101264}}, "image": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/09/02/article-2408684-14A3831C000005DC-316_1024x615_large.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "account_id": 15438913}, "robots": "noodp,noydir,all,noarchive", "keywords": "Humble,Ford,Focus,beats,host,glamorous,supercars,named,greatest,vehicle,past,25,years", "fb": {"app_id": 146202712090395}, "MSSmartTagsPreventParsing": "true", "articleid": 2408684, "divclasspage": "articlePage", "msvalidate.01": "12E6B4B813EB44C9BFC8F6A21F1D01F5", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMail", "published_time": "2013-09-02T07:12:54.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "author": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/search.html?s=&authornamef=Amanda+Williams", "section": "News", "modified_time": "2013-09-02T09:31:56.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "tag": "Humble Ford Focus beats host glamorous supercars named greatest vehicle past 25 years"}, "verify-v1": "DXwlrsxbqxSv+FTFkWUfgflBvFJfx2YbNf/HmABrVyY=", "y_key": "1a7e912afbfcab2f", "og": {"site_name": "Mail Online", "description": "The car, which can be bought for as little as \u00a3500 today, has been a hit with families and petrol heads since it was launched by Ford in 1998.", "title": "Humble Ford Focus beats host of glamorous supercars to be named the greatest vehicle of the past 25 years", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2408684/Humble-Ford-Focus-beats-host-glamorous-supercars-named-greatest-vehicle-past-25-years.html", "image": {"width": 308, "identifier": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/09/02/article-2408684-14A3831C000005DC-316_1024x615_large.jpg", "height": 185}, "type": "article"}, "channel": "News", "description": "The car, which can be bought for as little as \u00a3500 today, has been a hit with families and petrol heads since it was launched by Ford in 1998."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd662\"", "article_summary": "Ford Focus Mk1 (1998 - 2005)2.\nBugatti Veyron (2005-)8.\nHumble Ford Focus beats host of glamorous supercars to be named the greatest vehicle of the past 25 yearsIt beat McLaren F1 and Bugatti Veyron to be named the greatest in pollThe car, which can be bought for as little as \u00a3500 today,was launched in 1998Also beat Audi TT, Alfa Romeo 156, Aston Martin DB9 and Rover Mini CooperThe humble Ford Focus has beaten the McLaren F1 and Bugatti Veyron to be named the greatest car of the past 25 years.\nNews editor Jack Rix said: 'The Ford Focus has beaten a hot hatch with world rally championship-winning pedigree and the world's greatest supercar to the top prize.'\nMcLaren F1 (1992 - 1998)4."}
