She would adopt and love a tiny, unwanted, profoundly disabled girl named Charla. The private insurance companies that run Tennessee\u2019s Medicaid program would cover Charla\u2019s health care.\n\nDouglas doesn\u2019t think the state and its contractors have held up their end. In recent years she says she has fought battle after battle to secure essential care to control Charla\u2019s seizures, protect her from choking and tube-feed and medicate her multiple times a day.\n\n\u201cIf you have special-needs children you would not want to be taking care of these children and be harassed like this,\u201d Lynda Douglas said. \u201cThis is not right. No way, shape or form is this right.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nState Medicaid programs across the country, which operate with large federal contributions, have outsourced most of their care management in recent years to insurance companies like the ones in Tennessee. The companies cover poor and disabled Medicaid members in return for a fixed payment from taxpayers.\n\nThat helps government budgets but sets up a fundamental conflict of interest: the less care these companies deliver, the more money they make. Nationwide, such firms made operating profits of $2.4 billion last year, according to regulatory data compiled by Mark Farrah Associates and analyzed by Kaiser Health News.\n\nIn an attempt to manage that tension, Washington regulators are about to initiate the biggest overhaul of Medicaid managed-care rules in a decade. Prompted by growth of Medicaid outsourcing, concerns about access to care and stories like Charla Douglas, the regulations are expected to limit profits and set stricter requirements for care quality and the size of doctor networks.\n\n\u201cWe want the enrollees to have timely access to integrated, high-quality care,\u201d James Golden, who oversees Medicaid managed care for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, told a group of insurance executives in February. \u201cThere\u2019s been some question about some of these issues.\u201d\n\nTennessee Medicaid plans \u2014 operated by BlueCross BlueShield of Tennessee, UnitedHealthcare and Anthem \u2014 are among the most profitable Medicaid insurers in the country, according to data from Milliman, a consulting firm. The state, which runs one of the most respected Medicaid managed-care programs in the country, adopted that design in the 1990s and named it TennCare.\n\nState officials point to quality data and survey results as evidence that the companies are doing a good job while allowing the state to spend far less on Medicaid than predicted. More than 90 percent of TennCare customers surveyed last year said they were very satisfied or somewhat satisfied, officials note.\n\n\u201cOur patient satisfaction scores are at the highest over the last five years they\u2019ve been in 20 years of the program,\u201d said TennCare director Darin Gordon, who worries new HHS rules could hinder states from improving Medicaid quality while controlling costs. \u201cDon\u2019t hamstring us from doing other innovative activities that are going to be able to help try to improve the health and wellbeing of our population.\u201d\n\nBut doctors and patient advocates say state savings and insurer profits come at the price of inadequate physician networks, long waits for care and denial of treatments like the ones for Charla Douglas. Answering another question in the survey, 30 percent of adults said the quality of their TennCare care last year was only fair or poor.\n\n\u201cBlueCross is more organized and more strategic in its denials, and the other plans might be more careless, but the way it plays out for folks on the ground level is the same,\u201d said Michele Johnson, executive director of the Tennessee Justice Center, a nonprofit law firm that helps TennCare members navigate the system. \u201cWhat we find is that all three plans will deny care.\u201d\n\nMedicaid\u2019s expansion in most states under the Affordable Care Act has obscured another big but more gradual change: More than half of Medicaid beneficiaries now receive coverage from private insurers, known as managed care companies, with incentives to limit care. The surge helped prompt inquiries by HHS\u2019s inspector general last year that found widely varying state standards for access to doctors and poor information for members on where to find them.\n\nIn one nationwide study, half the doctors listed in official directories weren\u2019t taking Medicaid patients. Among doctors who were, a quarter couldn\u2019t see patients for a month.\n\nIn Tennessee views diverge sharply on whether the proposed federal rules, expected soon, are necessary. Many say the system is far from adequate.\n\nDena Deweese, who runs a primary care practice in Knoxville, has problems finding specialists for her patients who are covered through Amerigroup, a TennCare contractor and Anthem affiliate that recently began operating in the area.\n\n\u201cI kept running into no, no, no,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve still got lots of folks that are simply not taking it.\u201d\n\nAmerigroup says it only recently started covering TennCare members in the area and is still expanding its network. Since January \u201cwe have added more than 3,600 specialty physicians,\u201d said company spokeswoman Cindy Wakefield.\n\nTennCare\u2019s member-per-doctor standard for primary care is among the worst in states that have such rules \u2014 one provider per 2,500 members. Even for urgent care, TennCare rules allow waiting times of up to two days for an appointment.\n\nThe state allows one neurologist per 35,000 TennCare members, although most states have no network standards at all for such specialists.\n\nEven when children are having seizures, Crossville pediatrician Dr. Suzanne Berman often can\u2019t get a TennCare neurology referral for weeks.\n\n\u201cI have a kid who urgently needs to see a specialist,\u201d she said. \u201cWe call and we beg. \u2018We can see you in three months,\u2019 the neurologist\u2019s nurse will say. \u2018OK we can see you in two weeks.\u2019 No, we can\u2019t wait that long.\u201d\n\nOften she must send the child to a hospital emergency room to get the proper care \u2014 it\u2019s \u201cthe only way I have found to jump the queue,\u201d she said.\n\nDr. Douglas Springer, a gastroenterologist and, until recently, president of the Tennessee Medical Association, recognizes states\u2019 need to control Medicaid expense.\n\n\u201cThe cost in that population keeps going up and up and up,\u201d he said.\n\nBut he favors new rules to ensure adequate doctor networks and limit insurer profits.\n\n\u201cIf they can make it hard on [a patient], and make it so the networks are poorly funded or poorly populated, then nobody can go see anybody,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t have to spend any money.\u201d\n\nEvelyn Manley said she had to fight to get TennCare\u2019s insurers to cover even a portion of the behavioral therapy that doctors recommend for Christian, her five-year-old son with diagnoses of autism and Down\u2019s syndrome.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m grateful\u201d for TennCare, she said. \u201cBut it could definitely improve.\u201d\n\nLynda Douglas, 69, knew she wanted to adopt Charla a decade ago as soon as she took her for foster care from the state. Charla\u2019s problems include cerebral palsy, a badly curved spine, frequent seizures and osteoporosis. She cannot speak and takes most food by tube. She is 16, weighs less than 80 pounds and loves Barney the dinosaur.\n\nDouglas, who lives about an hour east of Nashville, says she has often struggled to get adequate treatment for Charla. But she was grateful that TennCare\u2019s contractors sent daytime nurses to monitor her seizures, keep her from choking, activate an implanted device to control seizures, administer medicine and maintain a tube that delivers medicine or nourishment eight times a day.\n\nThen more than a year ago UnitedHealthcare reduced the nursing to one hour a day even though Charla\u2019s condition hadn\u2019t improved. Douglas protested with the help of the Tennessee Justice Center and a pro-bono lawyer and won, but TennCare appealed. It took two more rounds of adjudication before a judge ruled in Douglas\u2019 favor late last year.\n\nThe managed-care companies \u201care making a mint down here,\u201d Douglas said. \u201cThey\u2019re getting rich at the expense of the kids. This is not right.\u201d\n\nUnitedHealthcare made operating profit of $236 million last year on revenue of $2.8 billion in its Tennessee Medicaid business, according to state filings. Anthem\u2019s operating profit for TennCare came to $53 million on revenue of $946 million. BlueCross\u2019s operating profit for TennCare was $121 million on revenue of $1.8 billion. Those results do not include expenses for taxes, depreciation and other items not directly related to health coverage.\n\n\u201cOur care teams worked with the family and with [Charla Douglas\u2019] physicians and other providers to assure that her services were appropriate for her special health care needs,\u201d UnitedHealthcare said in a prepared statement. The managed-care plan followed TennCare\u2019s contract and care guidelines, it said.\n\nThis year Charla switched to the BlueCross TennCare plan to better coordinate her care with two other disabled children in the Douglas household, one foster and one adopted. In March the plan denied coverage of the seizure-control pump that Charla\u2019s doctors prescribed, saying it was medically unnecessary.\n\nBlueCross now says it will pay for the procedure. A spokeswoman blamed the initial denial on a \u201cphysician\u2019s failure to provide the needed medical information.\u201d\n\nLike TennCare officials, the managed-care industry is urging HHS not to publish overly rigid regulations that bog plans down in paperwork and hinder them from making investments to keep members healthy.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re dealing with a huge variation in population\u201d covered by Medicaid from state to state, said Jeff Myers, CEO of Medicaid Health Plans of America, an industry lobby. \u201cEach state has an insurance commissioner. Presumably they\u2019re very good about making decisions about insurance regulation\u201d to suit local conditions, he said.\n\nMyers and other officials expect HHS to issue rules for \u201cmedical loss ratios\u201d that limit profits and force plans to spend a minimum portion of revenue on medical care. Such restrictions already apply to other insurance under the health law.\n\nImposing blanket profit standards on diverse Medicaid programs \u201cwould be terrible policy,\u201d he said.\n\nTennCare director Gordon, who frequently advises other states on Medicaid, rejects suggestions that managed-care networks are inadequate or that contractors deny needed care. Third-party surveys show that 90 percent of Tennessee doctors take TennCare and most of them take new TennCare patients, he said, although consumer advocates dispute this.\n\nTennCare members sometimes have trouble seeing specialist doctors, but so do patients in commercial plans, he said. Like many state Medicaid directors, he wonders how HHS can publish network rules for 50 states with widely varying geographies and health systems.\n\n\u201cWe actually have a pretty solid network,\u201d he said, with systems to closely track how contracted insurers are performing. The HHS investigation into Medicaid doctor networks \u201clooked at it very narrowly\u201d and \u201cgives you a less complete picture of what\u2019s going on in the states,\u201d he said.\n\nWritten the wrong way, Gordon said, HHS limits on managed-care profits could discourage spending on coordinators who improve care quality at decreased cost.\n\n\u201cYeah, we\u2019re a little concerned,\u201d about the proposed rules to be published by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, he added. \u201cThere are some things that we think may have adverse effects.\u201d\n\nOther Tennesseans tend to oppose Washington decrees no matter what they say.\n\n\u201cWe need to keep CMS out of our business. They have done nothing but screw everybody up,\u201d said Dr. Iris Snider, an Athens pediatrician who praises the job Gordon and other officials have done with TennCare. \u201cIt really worries me \u2026 when we finally get a system that\u2019s working reasonably well for my patients.\u201d\n\nKaiser Health News (KHN) is a national health policy news service.
