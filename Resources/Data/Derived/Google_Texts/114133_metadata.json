The high desert winds and open spaces help sharpen her intuitive instincts into what has been for years a knock on clairvoyance\u2019s door. So, from Borrego Springs, Torres offered her annual predictions of what to expect in 2014.\n\n\u201cLast year, I saw a Santa Claus rally coming this year and, sure enough, it happened,\u201d Torres said. \u201cLook at the stock market the past few weeks.\u201d\n\nTorres said the stock market this year will be very \u201cinteresting,\u201d with a roller coaster run the first quarter of the year.\n\n\u201cBut by the end of the year, everything will be really up,\u201d she said. \u201cOf course, there will be corrections at that time and some people will make a lot of money off those corrections. They know how to buy when something\u2019s down.\u201d\n\nTorres said the business world would see a surge in female entrepreneurs, who will find greater opportunities, jobs, capital and attention. She also predicted Nike, Google and Facebook are stocks to watch.\n\n\u201cPasswords will become obsolete and other forms of identity recognition will become the norm,\u201d Torres said. \u201cHacking will be a huge challenge this year and the problems with identity theft will create whole new industries to fight it.\u201d\n\nObamacare will see a lot of \u201chiccups.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere will be a lot of fraud,\u201d Torres said. But there is \u201can 85 percent chance\u201d that it all leads to a single-payer healthcare system down the road.\n\nVaccines are being developed right now to combat addictions, and drugs will be customized to a patient\u2019s profile, she predicted.\n\n\u201cI see growth in robotics, which will become more common and available for home use,\u201d she said.\n\nThe economy will see strong growth this year, which might slow toward the end of the last quarter.\n\n\u201cTechnology will drive that growth,\u201d Torres said. \u201cStart-ups will explode with new ways to transact business on mobile devices. Amazon\u2014now there\u2019s a good stock\u2014will get even bigger.\u201d\n\nThe housing market will be powerful, with high demand in Malibu, and the healthcare industry should benefit from new technologies delivering medical benefits to an individual\u2019s specific health profile.\n\n\u201cAnd the good news is that there will be no government shutdown in 2014 that stops the economy in its tracks,\u201d Torres said.\n\nInternationally, the Middle Eastern conflict will continue to be a problem. Syria will \u201cget worse before it gets better,\u201d and Torres worries about Israel\u2019s vulnerability to Middle Eastern unrest.\n\nBut there are bright spots around the world. Torres pointed out that women are finally permitted to drive in Saudi Arabia and the newly appointed Pope Francis has championed the voice of the poor. Persian women will be giving seminars on how to empower themselves. And to what do we owe this global change? The Internet.\n\n\u201cEveryone knows everything in the blink of an eye,\u201d she said. \u201cSo we will see greater progress in the plight of poor women, children and even animals this year\u2014there will be global appeals through the Internet that create big results.\u201d\n\nOn the energy front, Torres says she sees the U.S. becoming fully self-sufficient in 4 to 10 years, through a combination of renewable and greater oil extraction.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, I also see more big oil spills,\u201d she said.\n\nThe environment will benefit through the actions of watchdogs like Sea Shepherd. Bees, which are seeing an alarming drop in population, will see a resurgence in colonies thanks to pesticide crackdowns.\n\nPopular culture will see broad technological advances.\n\n\u201cStreaming will be the big thing in entertainment and we will see huge diversity on screens,\u201d Torres said. \u201cAnd in fashion, clothes will be made to measure caloric output during workouts.\u201d\n\nPolitically, Torres predicted that Hillary Clinton will announce her candidacy for a 2016 Presidential run, \u201cThough there is no guarantee she will win the primary.\u201d\n\n2014 is a \u201cnumber seven year,\u201d signifying the chariot in Tarot cards.\n\nTorres said it means \u201cwe must not let our passions rule our life. We are not our bodies, but our souls, and a thoughtful flow of cosmic energy will lead to personal success.\u201d\n\nShe did have one sobering thought for the New Year.\n\n\u201cThere is a high probability of a serious earthquake early in the year,\u201d Torres said. \u201cThere will be more seismic activity around the globe in general. So prepare your earthquake kits. I hope I\u2019m wrong on this one.\u201d\n\nAs for individual advice, Torres stressed a fine balance between work and personal reflection.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to remember that the future is not a destination, but the end result of decisions taken today,\u201d she concluded. \u201cBalancing hard work with meditative reflection is crucial to your success.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Malibu Times", "description": "Averi Torres likes to go vacation in Borrego Springs at the end of the year.
