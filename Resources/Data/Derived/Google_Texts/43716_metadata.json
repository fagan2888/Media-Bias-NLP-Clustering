Canada general manager Doug Armstrong is worried about disappointing players twice when it comes to making the final cuts to his World Cup of Hockey roster.\n\nAnd Team Europe GM Miroslav Satan joked that he doesn\u2019t ever recall watching this much hockey on TV during his 14-season NHL career, but scouting has kept his eyes glued to the screen.\n\nAdd in the NHL\u2019s trading deadline Monday, and it\u2019s going to be a frantic few days before the eight World Cup teams announcing the initial 16 players named to rosters on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re on conference calls once a week,\u201d said Tortorella, who was out of work when USA Hockey hired him as coach in September before taking over in Columbus a month later. \u201cIt\u2019s been stimulating knowing we\u2019re going to be in a tournament with the best players in the world.\u201d\n\nArmstrong doesn\u2019t expect many surprises to come on Wednesday. The bigger challenge will be making the final seven selections when full rosters are due on June 1.\n\n\u201cUsually, when you pick Team Canada, you disappoint people once,\u201d Armstrong said. \u201cSome players will be disappointed twice in this format.\u201d\n\nRussia, Sweden, Finland and the Czech Republic round out the six nations competing in the three-week tournament to be held in Toronto in September. And there will be two all-star teams. One will be made up of North American players 23 years and younger, and the other comprised of European players whose nations weren\u2019t invited.\n\nWith nearly a dozen countries to choose from, Satan has been busy scouting and reviewing his staff\u2019s evaluations.\n\n\u201cDefinitely, this is the most as far as watching hockey in a long, long period of time,\u201d he said.\n\nHere\u2019s a glance of the first 16 players projected by The Associated Press to be named to the Canadian, American, North American and European squads, and capsule glances of the four other teams:\n\nCANADA (Group A)\n\nForwards: Jamie Benn, Patrice Bergeron, Sidney Crosby, Ryan Getzlaf, Corey Perry, Tyler Seguin, Steven Stamkos, John Tavares, Jonathan Toews.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Projecting rosters for World Cup of Hockey participants", "title": "Projecting rosters for World Cup of Hockey participants", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Projecting rosters for World Cup of Hockey participants", "title": "Projecting rosters for World Cup of Hockey participants", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/02/29/projecting_rosters_for_world_cup_of_hockey_participants/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/02/world-cup-rosters-hockey.jpeg3-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Projecting rosters for World Cup of Hockey participants", "title": "Projecting rosters for World Cup of Hockey participants", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/02/world-cup-rosters-hockey.jpeg3-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "John Wawrow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cDefinitely, this is the most as far as watching hockey in a long, long period of time,\u201d he said.\nCanada general manager Doug Armstrong is worried about disappointing players twice when it comes to making the final cuts to his World Cup of Hockey roster.\nOne will be made up of North American players 23 years and younger, and the other comprised of European players whose nations weren\u2019t invited.\nTopics: From the Wires, Entertainment News, NewsJohn Tortorella is juggling two jobs, coaching both the Columbus Blue Jackets and Team USA.\n\u201cWe\u2019re on conference calls once a week,\u201d said Tortorella, who was out of work when USA Hockey hired him as coach in September before taking over in Columbus a month later."}
