(WOOD) \u2014 For the first time this tax season reporting health coverage is a requirement on a tax return.\n\nThe change is due to the Affordable Care Act which requires everyone to have health insurance.\n\nFor people who had health insurance last year, such as through work, they\u2019ll only have to check a box.\n\nBut for those who weren\u2019t covered or signed up for health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, it\u2019s a little more complicated and could possible cost them.\n\nWhile signing up for the Affordable Care Act, people were required to give an estimate of their income. They were then given a price for their healthcare coverage based on that estimate. When filing for a tax return, if the person actually made more than expected in 2014 they will have to pay extra for some of that healthcare coverage.\n\nPeople who didn\u2019t sign up for healthcare coverage will have to pay a tax penalty \u2014 the minimum for one person is $95 or a percentage of their income, whichever is higher.\n\nBigger penalties are expected for people who don\u2019t get healthcare coverage in 2015.\n\n\u201cThis year\u2019s penalties might not seem real large but those penalties will grow next year, it\u2019ll be higher the year after that, it\u2019ll be higher again,\u201d said Duane Culver of Culver CPA Group.\n\nCulver said tax preparers and CPAs have been training and preparing for the added paperwork this year. He suggests coming in early to get taxes done and not waiting until the last minute.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013\n\nOnline:\n\nIRS: Affordable Care Act Tax Provisions for Individuals and Families\n\nFees and Exemptions for no healthcare coverage\n\nShare this: Email\n\nPrint\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle\n\nPinterest\n\nMore\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\n\n\nReddit\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "For the first time this tax season reporting health coverage is a requirement on a tax return.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.linmedia.newstouch.wood", "og": {"site_name": "WOODTV.com", "description": "For the first time this tax season reporting health coverage is a requirement on a tax return.", "title": "New requirement for tax returns this year", "url": "http://woodtv.com/2015/01/23/new-requirement-for-tax-returns-this-year/", "image": {"width": 650, "identifier": "https://lintvwood.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/generic_tax_form_122611_nbc_20111226113738_640_480.jpg", "height": 370}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "For the first time this tax season reporting health coverage is a requirement on a tax return.", "creator": "@woodtv", "image": {"src": "https://lintvwood.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/generic_tax_form_122611_nbc_20111226113738_640_480.jpg?w=640"}, "title": "New requirement for tax returns this year", "site": "WOODTV", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Grand Rapids, MI news, weather, sports and traffic", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=488527284", "fb": {"pages": 20114386235}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "application-name": "WOODTV.com", "google-site-verification": "nqHTbbkW32A8Ssjvec6oDik57M8cANvAMyR0LzfR1to", "msvalidate.01": "25404283363C09DE121A55A903F03873", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/woodtv", "published_time": "2015-01-23T11:31:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-23T11:52:56+00:00"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://woodtv.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/28c7d45e6d62506344f0aad2af937984?s=16"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdec35\"", "article_summary": "GRAND RAPIDS, Mich.
