In the event that the Supreme Court rules against the Affordable Care Act in the King v. Burwell case, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) has plans for a health care law to replace it.

"The administration has done absolutely nothing to prepare for an upcoming Supreme Court decision that could leave millions of Americans unable to afford insurance thanks to this failed law," Cruz said, so he and many fellow Republicans plan to repeal "every last word of ObamaCare."

The "Cruzcare" bill, called the "Health Care Choices Act," would come close, The Hill reports, by voiding the mandate that requires everyone to buy insurance and by getting rid of major subsidies. The legislation would also allow people to purchase health insurance across state lines.

Cruz's bill is the most detailed of many proposals offered by the GOP, and it's possible that Republicans may ultimately approve a plan that combines aspects of various bills.

So far, Cruz's bill has five co-sponsors, including Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.). The Supreme Court is expected to reach a decision on the King v. Burwell case by June. Teresa Mull
