Why now?\n\nI thought it was a good moment\u2014just the right time. Immigration reform\u2019s time had come.\n\nHow does leading the nation on immigration reform mesh with serving constituents?\n\n[My constituents] are extremely concerned about immigration. They\u2019re not just from Mexico; they\u2019re from Poland and Ireland and Ukraine. [We\u2019ve filled out] 50,000 applications for U.S. citizenship, thousands of applications for family unification, thousands for deferred action [on deportation].\n\nWith so many issues in front of Congress\u2014Syria, the debt ceiling\u2014will immigration come up this fall?\n\nI think so. I\u2019m very optimistic.\n\nWhy, when Congress is still arguing over the president\u2019s health care plan?\n\nOn [the Affordable Care Act] there is no bridge between Republicans and Democrats. Same with the debt ceiling. Immigration reform is the only issue that generates bipartisanship. I just met with [House Judiciary Committee Chairman] Bob Goodlatte, a Republican from Virginia. The most important comment he made to me was, \u201cImmigration is not dead. It\u2019s alive. I want to get it done.\u201d\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean we have the same definition of immigration reform, but it does mean that we have the same hopes for passage. [Guti\u00e9rrez advocates for a pathway to citizenship for immigrants who are here illegally as well as ceasing the deportation of those with American children.]\n\nYou write in the book that the White House asked you to \u201cstand firm\u201d against an immigration bill from Republican senator Marco Rubio.\n\nThe White House sent its top policy adviser, Cecilia Mu\u00f1oz, to meet with the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and ask us not to support the Rubio proposal. She argued that the problem is it didn\u2019t have a pathway to citizenship [for those living in the country illegally]. Our response was: [We\u2019re] going to support Rubio because his proposal stops deportation [of those immigrants]. The president won\u2019t use his executive authority to stop it. I\u2019ll support Rubio until [the president] stops the deportations.\n\nYou\u2019ve been pestering the president to pursue immigration reform for years, including protesting outside the White House in 2011. Did Rahm Emanuel ever call you telling you to lay off?\n\nThe only time I remember really interacting with Rahm was when we met with the president [in the White House\u2019s State Dining Room in June 2009]. As we left the meeting, I said, \u201cMr. President, who do I follow up with?\u201d He turned around and said, \u201cRahm Emanuel.\u201d If you tell me the chief of staff is in charge, I know nobody is in charge.\n\nSo you never had any Rahm encounters in, say, the gym showers, as other congressmen did?\n\nNo. I once did him a favor. He knew that I kept extra shirts down in the House gym. When he went to get sworn in the first time [for Congress], he messed up his shirt. He said, \u201cHey, Luis, I know you got shirts here, bro.\u201d In his picture when he got sworn in, he was wearing my shirt.\n\nOn the Death of Harold Washington\n\n\n\nIn 1987, when Guti\u00e9rrez was a Chicago alderman, Mayor Washington was a beloved mentor. Here\u2019s what happened on November 25 of that year, according to an excerpt from Guti\u00e9rrez\u2019s new memoir.\n\nIt was right before Thanksgiving, and I was taking some time away from City Hall. Nothing much was happening. The city was quiet. [My wife] Soraida and I were at home together, cleaning the house and getting ready for the holidays. We were hosting our family for Thanksgiving. We were making plans when the phone rang. I answered it.\n\n\u201cLuis, it\u2019s Alderman Dick Mell. Now, don\u2019t get angry, and don\u2019t get excited. We have an important decision to make. Listen\u2014he\u2019s dead. One of my guys was the paramedic. On TV they are going to say he still has a chance, but I\u2019m telling you, he\u2019s dead.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t know what he was talking about.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s dead?\u201d\n\n\u201cYour mayor. He\u2019s dead. Now, we have to decide some things, and I\u2019d like your help. I want to be mayor of the city of Chicago. I\u2019m going to get the votes. I\u2019d like you to keep your options open. Don\u2019t make any hasty decisions.\u201d\n\n[When I went to my office at City Hall, I realized that] I had chosen the wrong place to go find fellow mourners. Many of my colleagues were following Dick Mell\u2019s lead, talking and plotting. The City Council would choose the next mayor, and the campaign was already underway.\n\nExcerpted from Still Dreaming: My Journey from the Barrio to Capitol Hill by Luis Guti\u00c9rrez with Doug Scofield.
