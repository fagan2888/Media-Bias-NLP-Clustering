Helping Seniors Live Independently

Since it was enacted into law in 1965, millions of our most vulnerable seniors have relied on the OAA for their health and economic security. The act helps seniors live independently by:

Supporting nutrition programs, including Meals-on-Wheels

Providing home and community-based services, including preventive health services and transportation assistance

Assisting family caregivers with information and referral, counseling and respite care

Preventing and detecting elder abuse

Providing part-time community service employment and training, including the Senior Community Service Employment Program (SCSEP), which has helped more than 1 million older Americans enter the workforce

The OAA provides an important safety net for people who are at risk of entering nursing homes, a costly option at nearly $88,000 per year for a private room. More than 85 percent of recipients of OAA-funded homemaker services, case management, transportation and home-delivered meals say that this assistance helped them to remain in their home, where the majority of Americans want to live as they age.
