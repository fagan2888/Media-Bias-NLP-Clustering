The [Glenn Beck-instigated] 9/12ers were involved. It was a total and complete agreement that nobody cared who got the credit, that everyone was going to run down the tracks together.\u201d\n\nPriebus made his comments on a Saturday morning CPAC panel addressing how conservatives could fight and defeat organized labor state by state. Moderator Grover Norquist, the president of Americans for Tax Reform, opened the panel by suggesting that conservatives had been neglecting the union issue in recent years out of a mistaken sense that private sector union demise was inevitable, and that public sector union decline was impossible.\n\nRather, argued Norquist, a raft of National Labor Relations Board appointments by Obama \u2013 who he said had made a strategic error by prioritizing Obamacare over a pro-union \u201ccard check\u201d bill \u2013 would make this \u201cthe time for the other team to cheat\u201d and hike private sector unionization. (Pro-labor scholars have questioned how much impact proposed rules from the NLRB, a body which lacked a quorum for some stretches of Obama\u2019s presidency, will have on union efforts.) Meanwhile, said Norquist, Republican victories in the states offered a chance to \u201cfix a lot of the abuses that we thought we\u2019d have to live with\u201d in the public sector. \u201cWisconsin,\u201d Norquist later told the crowd, \u201cis the model.\u201d\n\nScott Walker\u2019s 2011 \u201cbudget repair\u201d law, passed amid a high-profile multi-week protest occupation of the state capitol, severely reduced the right of public employees to collectively bargain, effectively imposed public sector \u201cRight to Work,\u201d and required regular \u201cre-certification\u201d elections among employees on whether to retain their now-narrowed form of union recognition.\n\nPanelist Luke Hilgemann, the current Americans for Prosperity COO who formerly led the Koch-backed group\u2019s Wisconsin efforts, told the crowd that the 2011 victory \u201cstarted back in 2007 on the shores of Lake Michigan,\u201d at a meeting of fifteen intrepid activists who\u2019d \u201chad enough of government overreach,\u201d including then-Milwaukee County Executive Scott Walker. Priebus, a former Wisconsin GOP head, credited the ability to pass Walker\u2019s reforms in part to the party and Tea Party activists unifying well before the 2010 primary behind candidates that made voters \u201cproud to wake up\u201d and vote, like Ron Johnson, Paul Ryan, and Walker. Norquist shared that Walker, after deciding to do a hasty signing of the \u201cbudget repair\u201d bill prior to the official event, in order to stave off attempts to sign union contracts before it became law, gave Norquist the pen he used to sign the bill.\n\nPanelist Vincent Vernuccio, of the Mackinac Center for Public Policy, said that Walker\u2019s success, and Indiana\u2019s 2012 \u201cRight to Work\u201d law, helped make possible the subsequent passage of \u201cRight to Work\u201d in Michigan\u2013 a state Norquist said national \u201cRight to Work\u201d activists hadn\u2019t had \u201con their hit list.\u201d Vernuccio also credited that victory in the United Auto Workers\u2019 stronghold to activists \u201cworking on Right to Work in Michigan for over twenty years\u201d; the passage of prior \u201csmall reforms\u201d that laid the groundwork; and overreach by unions whose failed 2012 collective bargaining constitutional amendment he said helped spur \u201cRight to Work\u201d despite GOP Governor Rick Synder\u2019s previous claim the issue was \u201cdivisive.\u201d (In contrast, unions point to pressure on Snyder, who had already signed other anti-union legislation, from top donors who\u2019d helped fuel his victory.)", "article_metadata": {"description": "At CPAC panel, RNC Chair Priebus touts \"total and complete unity\" between GOP, Tea Party, and Glenn Beck acolytes", "title": "\u201cWisconsin is the model\u201d: Grover Norquist\u2019s Tea Party scheme to crush his union enemies", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "At CPAC panel, RNC Chair Priebus touts \"total and complete unity\" between GOP, Tea Party, and Glenn Beck acolytes", "title": "\u201cWisconsin is the model\u201d: Grover Norquist\u2019s Tea Party scheme to crush his union enemies", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/03/08/wisconsin_is_the_model_grover_norquists_tea_party_scheme_to_crush_his_union_enemies/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/08/grover_norquist3.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "At CPAC panel, RNC Chair Priebus touts \"total and complete unity\" between GOP, Tea Party, and Glenn Beck acolytes", "title": "\u201cWisconsin is the model\u201d: Grover Norquist\u2019s Tea Party scheme to crush his union enemies", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/08/grover_norquist3.jpg", "creator": "@josheidelson", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Josh Eidelson", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, CPAC, CPAC 2014, Grover Norquist, Indiana, John Kasich, Labor, Ohio, Reince Priebus, Tea Party, UAW, Unions, Wisconsin", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddfbf\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe simplest way I can tell you is we had total and complete unity between the state party, quite frankly, Americans for Prosperity, the Tea Party groups, the Grandsons of Liberty.\nModerator Grover Norquist, the president of Americans for Tax Reform, opened the panel by suggesting that conservatives had been neglecting the union issue in recent years out of a mistaken sense that private sector union demise was inevitable, and that public sector union decline was impossible.\nTopics: CPAC, CPAC 2014, Grover Norquist, Indiana, John Kasich, Labor, Ohio, Reince Priebus, Tea Party, UAW, Unions, Wisconsin, Elections News, Business News, Politics News\u201cHow did we do it in Wisconsin?\u201d RNC Chair Reince Priebus asked Saturday morning.\nMeanwhile, said Norquist, Republican victories in the states offered a chance to \u201cfix a lot of the abuses that we thought we\u2019d have to live with\u201d in the public sector.\nPriebus, a former Wisconsin GOP head, credited the ability to pass Walker\u2019s reforms in part to the party and Tea Party activists unifying well before the 2010 primary behind candidates that made voters \u201cproud to wake up\u201d and vote, like Ron Johnson, Paul Ryan, and Walker."}
