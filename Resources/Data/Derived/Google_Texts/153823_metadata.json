It means hospitals and physicians are left with fewer unpaid bills for treatment, organizations that collect medical data can draw from a larger pool of patient information and more people can get affordable preventive care.\n\n\u201cBecause they have insurance, they\u2019re accessing care, and getting the screening and tests that they need, to hopefully prevent a later, catastrophic health situation,\u201d said Art Wingerter, president of Univera Healthcare.\n\nThe latest Census statistics are in line with insurance data released previously that shows Western New York and Upstate New York outperform the rest of the state and the nation when it comes to the uninsured rate.\n\nFor example, Western New York between 2010 and 2012 had an uninsured rate of 7.8 percent, the best of any upstate region over that time and lower even than the goal set by the Congressional Budget Office for the country for 2023.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re 10 years ahead, where we are now,\u201d Wingerter said.\n\nThe new Census statistics show Erie and Niagara counties have an uninsured rate of 6.45 percent, far below the 10.7 percent statewide rate and the 14.5 percent national rate. Adding Chautauqua and Cattaraugus counties puts the regional rate at 7 percent.\n\nThe only large New York counties that have lower uninsured rates than Erie are Saratoga, at 4.8 percent, and Madison, at 5.5 percent.\n\nDrilling deeper into the new data, just 2.2 percent of people under 18 in Erie County were uninsured in 2013, better than the 4 percent rate for New York State.\n\nLow-income residents of Erie County also are more likely to have insurance coverage than people living in the outlying counties. Nine percent of households in Erie County earning less than $25,000 were uninsured, compared to 12.3 percent in Chautauqua and 15.8 percent in Cattaraugus.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Even before the nation\u2019s new health insurance marketplaces went into effect, the percentage of people who did not have insurance coverage in Erie County was one of the lowest in New York State.Just 6 percent of Erie County residents lacked health insurance, the third-best showing am...", "og": {"site_name": "www.buffaloNews.com", "description": "Even before the nation\u2019s new health insurance marketplaces went into effect, the percentage of people who did not have insurance coverage in Erie County was one of the lowest in New York State.Just 6 percent of Erie County residents lacked health insurance, the third-best showing am... - The Buffalo News", "title": "Insured rate in Buffalo Niagara beats New York and nation  - The Buffalo News", "url": "http://www.buffalonews.com/city-region/medical/insured-rate-in-buffalo-niagara-beats-new-york-and-nation-20140920", "image": "http://www.buffalonews.com/storyimage/BN/20140920/CITYANDREGION/140929845/AR/0/AR-140929845.jpg&exactW=1000&exactH=1000&AlignV=middle&Q=80", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@TheBuffaloNews", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": "51000084,100004991951001"}, "__sync_contentCategory": "PayWall", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Why is Buffalo Niagara\u2019s uninsured rate so low?\nThe new Census statistics show Erie and Niagara counties have an uninsured rate of 6.45 percent, far below the 10.7 percent statewide rate and the 14.5 percent national rate.\nAcross New York, nearly 11 percent do not have health insurance, well below the national rate.\nLow-income residents of Erie County also are more likely to have insurance coverage than people living in the outlying counties.\nThe latest Census statistics are in line with insurance data released previously that shows Western New York and Upstate New York outperform the rest of the state and the nation when it comes to the uninsured rate."}
