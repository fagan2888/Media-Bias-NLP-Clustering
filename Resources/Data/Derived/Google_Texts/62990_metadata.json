Bowe Bergdahl, The Right, Politics News\n\nWe have a bright new dividing line in President Obama\u2019s second term: there was everything that happened up until this weekend\u2019s prisoner swap for Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, and then there was everything afterwards. There was the IRS, the VA, Obamacare, and Benghazi, and now there is Bergdahlzi. Republicans can hardly contain themselves. We\u2019ve got a hot one here!\n\nThere is no more loaded description in the Bergdahl coverage this morning than this single prepositional phrase in a New York Times report:\n\n\u201cYes, I\u2019m angry,\u201d Joshua Cornelison, a former medic in Sergeant Bergdahl\u2019s platoon, said in an interview on Monday arranged by Republican strategists. \u201cEverything that we did in those days was to advance the search for Bergdahl. If we were doing some mission and there was a reliable report that Bergdahl was somewhere, our orders were that we were to quit that mission and follow that report.\u201d\n\nBergdahl, once he\u2019s had some time to recover, will have the opportunity to explain his side of the story, why and whether he deserted his fellow soldiers, and so on. It\u2019s fair to hold off judgment until then. But conservatives have already determined, as my colleague Elias Isquith explains, that Bergdahl does not meet the standards of their fairytale version of the Good Soldier, so the U.S. government should have just left him to rot in an Taliban prisoner camp forever. Go ahead and arrange those calls, Republican strategists.\n\nWe use the phrase \u201cBergdahlzi\u201d with some hesitation. It\u2019s obvious. It\u2019s not clever. However! The political parallels with Benghazi \u2014 not the Benghazi incident itself, but the multi-year #Benghazi circus that\u2019s come in its wake \u2014 are impossible to avoid noticing, and we might as well run through them. Besides, conservatives themselves are already taking a shine to this term.\n\nWhat should be an endless parade of House hearings are on the way. Senators Lindsey Graham and John McCain, the self-appointed arbiters of all things good and evil in foreign affairs, are losing their shit. Susan Rice\u2019s Sunday show talking points are once again a source of grand controversy \u2014 expect to hear mockery of Rice\u2019s claim that Bergdahl served \u201cwith honor and distinction\u201d at conservative conferences for approximately the next 173 years. The attention-seekers who seek attention by calling for \u201cimpeachment of Barack Hussein Obama\u201d every time he sneezes are calling for the impeachment of Barack Hussein Obama.\n\nBut there\u2019s another path this story could go down, should Republicans choose to take it that way, that would really bake the Bergdahlzi cake: making former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton a focus of the controversy.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"Republican strategists\" are running the Bergdahl controversy.
