Sioux Falls, SD

From hockey games to monster truck shows and top concerts, the Denny Sanford PREMIER Center's schedule is filling up fast. A week ago, the events center announced Kenny Chesney would take the stage in June. Days later we learned Luke Bryan will perform in Sioux Falls in May. Those announcements may be just the beginning. On this Inside KELOLAND, we'll find out what's next for the new events center and we'll check in with the Sioux Falls Stampede to find out about the benefits of having the best venue in the league. We'll also find out how members of the Sioux Falls Storm are preparing for their first season at the PREMIER Center.

Plus, a new program has the potential to save lives in Sioux Falls. On this Inside KELOLAND, we also take a closer look at how Susan G. Komen South Dakota is expanding in hopes of reaching more women than ever before.
