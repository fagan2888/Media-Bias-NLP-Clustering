Donald Trump said if elected, he'll repeal ObamaCare and replace it with "something so much better."

Trump was asked during the ABC News Republican presidential debate if his vision for health care was closer to Sen. Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton, and he responded by saying he was "closer to common sense." Trump said the other Republican candidates are being taken care of by "insurance people," but he's not, and he's tired of companies "getting rich on ObamaCare, rich on health care, health services. We're going to end that."

His plan, he said, is to "take out the artificial boundaries" and have "people compete, free enterprise." Health care savings plans are "excellent," he added, and he's going to make sure that everyone is covered. "A certain number of people will be on the street dying; as a Republican, I don't want that to happen," he said. "We're going to help people on the street." Catherine Garcia
