We are in so much trouble as a country and there are so many things going on right here in our district that need to be addressed,\u201d Matthews-Davis said. \u201cWe happen to have a very nice man in office representing us, but he hasn\u2019t done anything for the people of our district. We need manufacturing jobs \u2013 we need to do things that provide economic resources to the people that live right here.\n\n\u201cThere are just so many things that need to be addressed and its time that they are.\u201d\n\nWhen Matthews-Davis stops to think about the issues that are plaguing the district, she doesn\u2019t think of a boilerplate response. There are no one-word answers \u2013 no cheat-sheet quips that summarizes her Republican candidacy. Her thoughts are long and drawn-out and her ideas aren\u2019t all that far out of line from what you\u2019d hear on television news broadcasts from conservative parts of the country.\n\nBut at the heart of it all, Matthews-Davis says that she feels the way that she feels because it\u2019s the way that the people she has talked to feel. She\u2019s channeling their fear about losing their jobs because healthcare costs are skyrocketing. She\u2019s sharing their belief that a hike in minimum wage will stifle any future job growth.\n\nThey aren\u2019t talking points. They\u2019re heartfelt and deliberate answers and while she admits that some of them might not necessarily be so well-received \u2013 like offering to trade \u201cObamacare\u201d for the minimum wage increase if elected \u2013 they\u2019re definitely carried with her district in mind.\n\n\u201cI go out there and I talk to people and those are the sorts of things that they\u2019re concerned with \u2013 losing their jobs because \u2018Obamacare\u2019 is making it too expensive for employers to keep them on the payroll. People are legitimately worried about that,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that because of the high cost of insurance businesses can\u2019t afford to raise their minimum wage \u2013 these are the kinds of things that are holding up growth in not just our district but across the entire country.\n\n\u201cIf you look around Manteca and Lathrop and Stockton you can see that it\u2019s perfect for manufacturing \u2013 it was a great place for manufacturing at one time. But you have places like Texas that are drawing businesses away from here by offering them tax incentives and breaks and that\u2019s killing our economy. We need to look into offering those here in California. We need to help our people.\u201d\n\nMatthews-Davis, according to reports, became the target of a violent anti-tax group in late 1993 when she refused to lift a lien that topped $400,000 from one of its members. An Oregon man, Roger Steiner, was convicted for ambushing her while she was in her garage \u2013 beating her to the ground and then placing an unloaded gun to her head and dry-firing it several times.\n\nShe was also sexually assaulted during the incident.\n\nHe spent 18 years in federal prison and was recently released. He contacted the Modesto Bee in February and claimed that he was being \u201crailroaded\u201d in the press and that he was the victim in the situation because he spent 18 years in prison for a crime he didn\u2019t commit. Since his release, according to Matthews-Davis, the threats against her life have intensified and she believes that the same group or the people affiliated with it two decades ago \u2013 a group calling themselves the Juris Christian Assembly \u2013 is responsible.\n\nIt hasn\u2019t deterred her.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been scary and it\u2019s like throwing a bucket of ice water on democracy,\u201d she said. \u201cNobody should be threatened because they\u2019re running for office, but I\u2019m not somebody that runs from threats. It has changed the way that I can do things, but that doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t get the word out and talk about the sorts of things that matter.\n\n\u201cImmigration in this country needs to be overhauled. Maybe it\u2019s time that we bring the military back from one of the bases overseas and get them to protect our borders, and made it mandatory for all immigrants to assimilate into American life \u2013 to learn civics and basic English so that they can succeed. There are a lot of things that need to happen in Washington, D.C., that aren\u2019t happening right now. It\u2019s time somebody stepped up and took care of those.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.mantecabulletin.com/archives/105680/", "image": "http://media.morristechnology.com/webmedia/upload/manteca_bulletin/article/2014/05/14/MATTHEWS--Campaign-PIC-LT.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Threats on her life haven\u2019t derailed Karen Matthews-Davis\u2019 attempt to take 9th Congressional District Representative Jerry McNerney to task for what she says is an apathetic approach to governing.", "title": "Death threats fail to stop Congress hopeful"}, "google-site-verification": "3Z8d-11ZWjT9s7dvU3HKQNiR3B8VGgkvhCZnKsTcGcc", "robots": "noarchive", "title": "Death threats fail to stop Congress hopeful"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbf04\"", "article_summary": "We need manufacturing jobs \u2013 we need to do things that provide economic resources to the people that live right here.\nThere are a lot of things that need to happen in Washington, D.C., that aren\u2019t happening right now.\n\u201cNobody should be threatened because they\u2019re running for office, but I\u2019m not somebody that runs from threats.\nThreats on her life haven\u2019t derailed Karen Matthews-Davis\u2019 attempt to take 9th Congressional District Representative Jerry McNerney to task for what she says is an apathetic approach to governing.\n\u201cWe happen to have a very nice man in office representing us, but he hasn\u2019t done anything for the people of our district."}
