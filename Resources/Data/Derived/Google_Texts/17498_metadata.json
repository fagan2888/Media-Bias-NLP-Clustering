The plan was to experience a pristine landscape rarely seen by humans and, if they were lucky, catch a glimpse of the region\u2019s polar bears. They went prepared with flares and electric fences \u2014 enough, they assumed, to protect them from the massive predators. It wasn\u2019t.\n\nTo say any more would be to spoil the suspenseful, true-life story that Sabrina Shankman recounts in her e-book \u201cMeltdown: Terror at the top of the world,\u201d which was produced with InsideClimate News. You can read an excerpt here. (An accompanying documentary series produced with Vice Media will be premiering later this month.)\n\nJust as terrifying as the details of the attack is the other story Shankman tells: that of the rapidly melting Arctic and its accompanying loss of sea ice, habitat to the polar bears, which scientists warn are facing extinction. Without the ice, the polar bears are unable to hunt seals, their main source of food. Starving and stuck on land, they venture inland in search of alternative food sources \u2014 because of that, experts believe that the number of dangerous interactions between the bears and human populations are set to increase dramatically. \u201cAfter all,\u201d Shankman writes, \u201cto a starving bear, a human is just meat.\u201d\n\nAll that would be reason enough, for me, to avoid polar bear country entirely. But what\u2019s happening up north, of course, is but a magnified version of the changes taking place throughout the planet. As one scientist told Shankman, \u201cWhat\u2019s happening to the polar bears is what\u2019s going to happen to us.\u201d\n\nSalon spoke with Shankman about her book. This interview has been lightly edited for clarity.\n\nTell me how you found this story.\n\nIt came directly to us at InsideClimate News, through one of the guys on the trip, Larry Rodman. In the early fall of last year, after he\u2019d been back for a while, he reached out to David Sassoon, our publisher, and had this crazy story of this trip that he\u2019d been on. Around that time, I was starting to talk with David about coming onboard at ICN and he said, \u201dYeah, and we\u2019ve got this story we\u2019d love for you to take on,\u201d so that was kind of hard to say no to. As a journalist, you hear about these stories once in a blue moon where it\u2019s just such an incredible survival adventure narrative but at the same time has such interesting depths that you can get into from a scientific and climate-change perspective.\n\nDid you know going into it that this was going to be about more than just a random attack that happened? That it would have the huge implications about what\u2019s happening in the Arctic?\n\nI knew from the start that it was going to have bigger implications, but I wasn\u2019t sure exactly what the connections were going to be. For anyone in our field, if you hear about polar bears there\u2019s this inherent connection to climate change. One thing I didn\u2019t know, for instance, was what the polar bears in that specific region were dealing with, because a lot of the issues that polar bears are facing are future problems. There are some populations that are already dealing with declines: I saw you wrote about that report that came out earlier this week, and that\u2019s further evidence of another group that\u2019s really not doing well. But a lot of the bigger issues that biologists talks about, it\u2019s what\u2019s coming down the line for them.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until I really started working on the project that I realized that though the numbers are really good for the Davis Strait population, it\u2019s actually starting to experience some of the early warning signs that come right before the decline in population \u2014 like decreasing body condition and lower survival rates of cubs \u2014 and that they had seen such a huge decrease in days of sea ice.\n\nSo are polar bear-human interactions definitely increasing? And if so, how much of that can we attribute to climate change?\n\nThe biologists who are working on this are just really wrapping their arms around this right now. There\u2019s a guy named James Wilder who I quote in the book who, until recently, was with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in Alaska. He\u2019s been working on compiling the first-ever database of all these attacks because the problem is, the reporting is really shoddy even in places where it\u2019s good \u2014 Canada\u2019s known for having better reporting. In the e-book I talk about all these incidents that weren\u2019t in the database, I think because in some of these Inuit communities these incidents are almost part of life.\n\nWhat James Wilder has found is that they are on the rise, and what other biologists like Ian Stirling and Andrew Derocher and Steven Amstrup \u2014 the big names in polar bear biology \u2014 what they\u2019ve been saying all along is that you\u2019re going to see an increase in interactions as climate change progresses.\n\nWhen I talked to James Wilder about it, I asked him, \u201cIs this because of climate change? Is that why we\u2019re on target for 35 incidents this decade when, in the past, it was more like 10?\u201d And he said, \u201cMaybe.\u201d That\u2019s definitely one of the reasons it could be; it could also have to do with other things that we\u2019re maybe not aware of yet, and that\u2019s kind of the idea of classic scientist hedging. But you can\u2019t definitively say anything except for the fact that it\u2019s been projected for a long time that incidents like this would rise as climate change continues; climate change has continued; you\u2019ve seen a lot of other indications of population stress in certain regions; and you\u2019ve also seen an increase in attacks.\n\nAnecdotally, there also seem to be a number of indications that climate change is changing the region, that polar bears are popping up more. What did you observe when you traveled up there?\n\nIt was new to me \u2014 I\u2019d never been up that far north. But I was up there with the Vice crew and with Matt Dyer, the guy that got attacked. As opposed to what the group did a year earlier, we hired a couple of Inuit bear guards from the region. It was a brother and a sister, and it just so happened that they had grown up going to this exact same fjord every summer with their family, so they had really seen these changes. These are people who are in their 50s, maybe 60s, so what they had seen was a total change in the landscape. As the summers have gotten warmer, which is something they\u2019ve noticed, you\u2019ve seen the mountaintops change from grey and brown to green because there\u2019s all this growth happening now because the climate\u2019s changed. You also see mosquitos everywhere where in the past there weren\u2019t mosquitos at all. Someone from Parks Canada told me they\u2019ve had someone come to the park to study that exact phenomenon and ask why the bugs are there.", "article_metadata": {"description": "As the ice caps melt, polar bears are losing their natural habitats \u2014\u00a0and starvation is driving them to violence", "title": "When polar bears attack: How climate change is creating a new breed of unlikely killers", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "As the ice caps melt, polar bears are losing their natural habitats \u2014\u00a0and starvation is driving them to violence", "title": "When polar bears attack: How climate change is creating a new breed of unlikely killers", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/11/22/when_polar_bears_attack_how_climate_change_is_creating_a_new_breed_of_unlikely_killers/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/polar_bear.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "As the ice caps melt, polar bears are losing their natural habitats \u2014\u00a0and starvation is driving them to violence", "title": "When polar bears attack: How climate change is creating a new breed of unlikely killers", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/polar_bear.jpg", "creator": "@readingirl", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Lindsay Abrams", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Animals, Climate Change, Editor's Picks, Global Warming, polar bears, The Arctic", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda0c2\"", "article_summary": "One thing I didn\u2019t know, for instance, was what the polar bears in that specific region were dealing with, because a lot of the issues that polar bears are facing are future problems.\nFor anyone in our field, if you hear about polar bears there\u2019s this inherent connection to climate change.\nAs one scientist told Shankman, \u201cWhat\u2019s happening to the polar bears is what\u2019s going to happen to us.\u201dSalon spoke with Shankman about her book.\nAnecdotally, there also seem to be a number of indications that climate change is changing the region, that polar bears are popping up more.\nWithout the ice, the polar bears are unable to hunt seals, their main source of food."}
