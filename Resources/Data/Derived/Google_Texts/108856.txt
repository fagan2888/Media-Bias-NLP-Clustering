Aurora police arrested a man considered a person of interest in a homicide after finding a body near North Potomac Street on Saturday night.

Officers arrived at the scene, a field along the Toll Gate Creek between Interstate 225 and North Potomac Street, at about 10:35 p.m. after someone reported a murder, according to police.

“Among those contacted were an adult male that was later taken into custody on an unrelated arrest warrant, and is considered a person of interest at this time,” police said in a release.

Detectives are trying to determine if the victim and others involved in the incident are transients.

Police haven’t said how the victim was killed. They haven’t identified the person of interest in order to avoid compromising the investigation, the release said.

The victim will be identified by the Arapahoe County Coroner’s Office.

Police ask that anyone with information on the case call Detective Chad Lampson at 303-739-6013.
