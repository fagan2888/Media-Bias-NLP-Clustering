A man is behind bars after a shooting in Callaway Friday night.

Investigators believe the shooting began as an argument over a broken bottle in the 5200 block of Lee Drive.

Alleged shooter Torie Robinson was upset someone had left a cracked bottle on the ground, because kids played in the area.

The victim began picking up the pieces, but continued to argue with Robinson.

Robinson took out his gun and shot him four times after the victim punched Robinson's friend.

Bay County deputies sent out a "be on the lookout" overnight.

Robinson has been arrested and is charged with aggravated battery.
