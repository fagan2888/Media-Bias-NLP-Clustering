But this year at the Kentucky State Fair a record was broken when a ham was auctioned off for a cool $2 million dollars. This high-dollar pork product, dry cured using a combination of salt, smoke and time, isn't wrapped in solid gold, or autographed by the Pope, as its price tag may suggest.\n\n\n\nSo what, exactly, makes it a $2 million dollar ham?\n\nIn Kentucky, auctioning off hams for six or seven figures is a tradition of sorts. Every August a competition is held at the state fair in Louisville, where contestants enter their hams to be judged by a panel of judges. The ham that takes the top place (and the blue ribbon) is then presented at the Kentucky Farm Bureau Country Ham Breakfast & Auction where it is auctioned to the highest bidder and the money always goes to charity. Organizers and journalists both remark upon the tradition\u2019s levity, noting that it\u2019s as much a public relations opportunity for corporations and politicians who open their pocketbooks as it is a food contest.\n\nStill, for the producer whose cured ham wins grand champion, the auction is a big deal.\n\n\u201cIt normally sells for about $60, so it\u2019s a bit amazing to us,\u201d says Beth Drennan, who, with husband Ronny, owns country ham company Broadbent B&B Foods in Cadiz, KY, which produced the record breaking pork product. The Drennan\u2019s prize-winning ham weighed in at 15 pounds, making that $125,865 per pound at auction.\n\n\u2018It normally sells for about $60, so it\u2019s a bit amazing to us.\u2019\n\nThe Drennans are old hands at getting their hams past the judges and into the auction; 2014 marked their ninth win.\n\nThe judges, Ronny says, are looking for certain visual qualities: a tight and trimmed \u201cbutt face,\u201d the flat edge of the hind leg where its severed from the body; a black butt face color with a brown ring of fat; and a taut, pecan-colored skin. The judges will inject a probe into the ham to help them smell if the ham cured fully.\n\nThe Kentucky Farm Bureau Country Ham Breakfast is an annual state fair event. It\u2019s a 1600-person party that brings together the state\u2019s ag leaders, elected officials and corporate officers to scarf down biscuits, eggs and, of course, ham. The Drennans, as winners, were seated at the breakfast\u2019s lead table alongside Kentucky Governor Steve Beshear, a Democrat, U.S. Senator Mitch McConnell, a Republican, and the Kentucky Agriculture Commissioner James Comer. The winning ham is dressed on a silver platter and garnished by roses. The current Miss Kentucky parades the ham around for viewing by the bank presidents, CEOs and small business owners who bid on it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an ironically majestic finale for a hind end that spent many of its days ignobly covered in mud,\u201d writes Louisville-based food journalist Steve Coomes in his book \u201cCountry Ham: A Tradition of Hogs, Salt and Smoke.\u201d\n\nThe tradition was cooked up 50 years ago when the Kentucky Farm Bureau and other state agricultural leaders were looking for ways to keep the state fair focused on its agrarian traditions.\n\n\u201cThey were seeing that the emphasis had shifted and wanted to preserve agriculture\u2019s role there,\u201d said Kentucky Farm Bureau spokesperson Dan Smaldone. Part of that preservation included the country ham auction, which highlighted the state\u2019s hog industry as well as Kentuckians\u2019 prowess at curing ham.\n\nThe event today has little to do with ham or pork production, says Smaldone. The breakfast is an opportunity for politicians to stump before a room filled with voters, donors and reporters. And last year, Smaldone remembers, the political speeches became rather heated as Beshear and McConnell traded barbs over Obamacare.\n\nThe entire bid goes to charity, usually education or health nonprofits. Not a penny goes to the Farm Bureau or the winning ham maker.\n\nThe winning bids began accumulating their current Scrooge McDuck levels once competing bidders began combining their cash. For example, say a bank president bids $750,000. Then a doctor bids $800,000. Instead of capping it all there, the two parties decide to both throw in $800,000 to be good sports. That\u2019s what happened in 2010, when the winning bid was $1.6 million. A pairing happened again this year.\n\nThe entire bid goes to charity, usually education or health nonprofits. Not a penny goes to the Farm Bureau or the winning ham maker, Smaldone says.\n\nThe contest brings a great deal of attention to one expensive ham, but some lament that it does little to promote appreciation for the Appalachian art of country ham, a tradition that dates back decades. Ronny recalls a farming childhood spent curing homegrown hams.\n\n\u201cIt used to be every farmer cured ham, but there\u2019s not too many of them left that does that,\u201d says Drennan, who cures 12,000 hams a year. \u201cIt\u2019s a dying art.\u201d\n\nChefs are starting to pay attention, Coomes told Modern Farmer, paying top dollar for country hams made from heritage breed pigs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like wine making, (the ham) is not the same every year,\u201d says Coomes. \u201cIt\u2019s a vintage.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "What makes a $2 million ham so valuable?", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Modern Farmer", "description": "What makes a $2 million ham so valuable?", "title": "The $2 Million Ham  - Modern Farmer", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://cdn.modernfarmer.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/hamhero.jpg", "height": 742}, "updated_time": "2014-09-18T10:57:14-04:00", "url": "http://modernfarmer.com/2014/09/makes-2-million-ham-worth-much/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "What makes a $2 million ham so valuable?", "creator": "@ModFarm", "image": "http://cdn.modernfarmer.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/hamhero.jpg", "title": "The $2 Million Ham  - Modern Farmer", "site": "@ModFarm", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 34000152}, "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"The $2 Million Ham \",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/modernfarmer.com\\/2014\\/09\\/makes-2-million-ham-worth-much\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-09-16 13:19:59\",\"mod_date\":\"2014-09-18 10:57:14\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":26446,\"author_id\":\"56\",\"author_name\":\"Andr\\u00e9 Gallant\",\"author_display_name\":\"Andre Gallant\",\"tags\":[\"Farm Bureau\",\"ham\"],\"categories\":[\"Food\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/modernfarmer.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2014\\/09\\/hamhero.jpg\"}", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ModernFarmerMedia", "section": "Food", "tag": "ham", "published_time": "2014-09-16T13:19:59-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-18T10:57:14-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "news_keywords": "farm bureau, ham, home and garden, environment, technology, food, culture, plants, animals"}, "article_summary": "Part of that preservation included the country ham auction, which highlighted the state\u2019s hog industry as well as Kentuckians\u2019 prowess at curing ham.\nBut this year at the Kentucky State Fair a record was broken when a ham was auctioned off for a cool $2 million dollars.\nThe ham that takes the top place (and the blue ribbon) is then presented at the Kentucky Farm Bureau Country Ham Breakfast & Auction where it is auctioned to the highest bidder and the money always goes to charity.\nThe Kentucky Farm Bureau Country Ham Breakfast is an annual state fair event.\nThe judges will inject a probe into the ham to help them smell if the ham cured fully."}
