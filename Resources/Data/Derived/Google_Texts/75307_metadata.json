But as medicine grows increasingly technocratic, we see doctors or bioethics committees placing them on charts without consent\u2013perhaps without discussion\u2013with family or patient.\n\nIn the UK\u2013the mother of all technocratic medical systems\u2013non voluntary DNRs have become something of a scandal. From the BBC story:\n\nA \u201cdo not resuscitate\u201d (DNR) order means medical staff will not attempt to bring the patient back to life if they stop breathing or their heart stops. The decision to use one is ultimately a doctor\u2019s, but guidelines state medical staff have a duty to discuss it with relatives wherever possible. The study of just over 9,000 dying patients, taken from cases in May 2015, found that in 81% of cases where a DNR was in place, a senior doctor did discuss the decision with a family \u2013 up from 72% in a 2013 audit. In 16% of cases the decision was not discussed with relatives. In the other 4% of cases records showed there were no relatives or the family could not be contacted.

It already does.\n\nIt isn\u2019t just the DNR itself. There is anecdotal evidence that a DNR on a chart can lead to other treatments being withheld, despite the fact it is supposed to only apply to cardiac arrest.\n\nPertinently, some of the most influential architects of Obamacare looked to the NHS as their model of centralized control.\n\nWhen you have centralized control, you get check-list medicine rather than individual care\u2013sometimes with lethal results, as in this story and the Liverpool Care Pathway backdoor euthanasia scandal.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Doctors are Putting Involuntary DNRs on Patients' Charts Without Their Family's Consent", "og": {"site_name": "LifeNews.com", "description": "The \u201cdo not resuscitate order\u201d (DNR)\u00a0is\u00a0an important part of medicine that allows terminally ill, injured, and\u00a0very aged patients die naturally without i", "title": "Doctors are Putting Involuntary DNRs on Patients\u2019 Charts Without Their Family\u2019s Consent", "url": "http://www.lifenews.com/2016/05/02/doctors-are-putting-involuntary-dnrs-on-patients-charts-without-their-familys-consent/", "image": "http://www.lifenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/picassistedsuicide17.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 204509779594999}, "OBKey": "avejq02j7xRr+0owuq+Pcw==", "keywords": "doctors are putting involuntary dnrs on patients\\' charts without their family\\'s consent", "google-site-verification": "PPPx-GD0i7nWjUFAYnFdOYorAAJLuNyKOl23JCeXyrQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "In the UK\u2013the mother of all technocratic medical systems\u2013non voluntary DNRs have become something of a scandal.\nSince it involves life and death, in this country (unlike the UK), DNRs are supposed to be only put on a chart with consent.\nBut as medicine grows increasingly technocratic, we see doctors or bioethics committees placing them on charts without consent\u2013perhaps without discussion\u2013with family or patient.\nIn short, the DNR informs a medical team faced with a patient in cardiac arrest to stand down.\nIn the other 4% of cases records showed there were no relatives or the family could not be contacted."}
