Screenshot CBS 2 News\n\nAt less than 1 lb. \u201414 ounces exactly \u2014 Decklen Maize is just 10 inches, and this mini-preemie is struggling for his life. His parents are praying for a miracle as doctors at St. Mary Medical Center in Apple Valley, Calif., try tirelessly to save the preterm baby.\n\nAlthough Decklen was born four months early, James and Carrie Maize are hoping he keeps fighting on.\n\n\u201cEveryone's been telling us there's nothing they could do for him, that he's not passed the viability stage,\" Mom Carrie Maize told the NY Daily News. \"But we thought if he comes out with a heartbeat and breathing, we want something done. If he's fighting, they need to fight with him and for him.\"\n\nHe was supposed to be born in September, but Decklen was born on Tuesday at 22 weeks, and unfortunately this is not the first preterm baby that Carrie has had. Last year, she gave birth to a baby girl at 22 weeks, but sadly, she died. Decklen is just about the size of his dad\u2019s hand, and he is surviving with the help of a ventilator.\n\nThe Maizes had to make a quick emergency decision on the preemie when they discovered he had an umbilical cord prolapse. So, Carrie decided to undergo an emergency C-section. When James heard what was happening, he rushed back from his army base in Virginia \u2014 he said he refused to give up on his son.\n\nIf the Maizes weren\u2019t quick thinking on their feet, the umbilical cord would have cut off Decklen\u2019s oxygen because it had already passed through the birth canal from the baby\u2019s head, the Daily News reported.\n\n\"Our son was more than strong enough,\" Carrie said. \"He's handling it like a champ.\" While mom will be able to go home, Decklen will remain in the neonatal intensive care for many months.\n\nDecklen is known as a micro-preemie, who are babies before 26 weeks. Their rates of survival of the years have increased with technology, but the earlier they are born, the less chance they have at surviving.\n\nAlso, in premature babies that do survive, there are many complications. They might suffer from respiratory distress syndrome, which means that they have difficulty breathing due to immaturity of the baby's lungs, anemia, apnea, increased rate of infections, and many other issues.\n\n\u201cIf he\u2019s a fighter, you know, we want him to fight and make his own decisions,\u201d James said. \u201cIt\u2019s rough\u2026just being able to sit there at his bedside and just pretty much whisper.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "preemie, preterm baby", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Decklen weighs less than a gallon of milk, but his parents call him a fighter and hope their son pulls through.", "title": "14-Ounce California Preemie Struggles To Stay Alive [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/preemie-born-4-months-early-weighing-less-1-pound-struggles-life-283116", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/05/16/decklan-maize.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Decklen weighs less than a gallon of milk, but his parents call him a fighter and hope their son pulls through.", "title": "14-Ounce California Preemie Struggles To Stay Alive [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/preemie-born-4-months-early-weighing-less-1-pound-struggles-life-283116", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/05/16/decklan-maize.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/05/16/decklan-maize.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-05-16T17:27:53-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-05-16T17:27:48-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Decklen weighs less than a gallon of milk, but his parents call him a fighter and hope their son pulls through."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbdcb\"", "article_summary": "\u201414 ounces exactly \u2014 Decklen Maize is just 10 inches, and this mini-preemie is struggling for his life.\nAlthough Decklen was born four months early, James and Carrie Maize are hoping he keeps fighting on.\n\u201cEveryone's been telling us there's nothing they could do for him, that he's not passed the viability stage,\" Mom Carrie Maize told the NY Daily News.\nDecklen weighs less than a gallon of milk, but his parents call him a fighter and hope their son pulls through.\n\u201cIf he\u2019s a fighter, you know, we want him to fight and make his own decisions,\u201d James said."}
