More\n\nWhat those expectations will be at the time of the Feb. 9 election remain to be seen, but Fiorina is not disturbed by her standing in the polls, either in New Hampshire or nationally.\n\nThis week\u2019s WMUR/CNN New Hampshire Poll had the former Hewlett-Packard CEO at 5 percent, tied for seventh place.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to do what I have to do in New Hampshire,\u201d she said in an interview with WMUR.com. \u201cI\u2019m not saying I\u2019m going to win New Hampshire. I need to exceed expectations in New Hampshire. I need to exceed expectations in Iowa, and I need to keep going because this is a long race.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone would have predicted that I would be in the top six,\u201d Fiorina said after meeting with about 40 members of the Derry Rotary Club.\n\n\u201cThe trajectory that I have had is unlike any other candidates. Nobody knew who I was. Nobody gave me a chance. And I\u2019m sitting in the top six.\"\n\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m sitting there while others have spent millions of dollars on television,\u201d she said. \u201cI haven\u2019t spent anything, so I think I\u2019m doing pretty good. But now it comes down to in the end, voters are going to decide, not polls.\u201d\n\nAnd, she said, polls have been notoriously wrong.\n\nFiorina was asked what she intends to ask GOP frontrunner Donald Trump about his controversial series of remarks about refugees, Muslims and immigrants at next the Republican presidential debate next Tuesday.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the plan?\u201d Fiorina said. \u201cHe never has any specifics.\u201d\n\nShe said Trump\u2019s call to ban all Muslims from the country \u201cis a big distraction from the fact that he has no plan.\n\n\u201cWhen he\u2019s asked, \u2018What are you going to do about ISIS?\u2019 he says, \u2018You don\u2019t want to know what I\u2019m going to do about ISIS.\u2019 He doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s going to do about ISIS.\n\n\u201cSo quit throwing out outrageous statements and tell us what you\u2019re going to do,\u201d Fiorina said.\n\nFiorina said there should be a \u201cpause\u201d in the admission of refugees from Syria until a method can be devised to properly vet them.\n\nShe said the \u201cfundamental problem\u201d is on that issue is: \u201cThe government isn\u2019t performing its job.\n\n\u201cPeople are falling through the cracks for background checks on guns,\u201d she said, noting that the killer of nine people in a massacre at a church in South Carolina in June should not have received clearance to purchase a gun.\n\n\u201cAnd the fianc\u00e9e in San Bernardino, how did they miss this? There are so many examples where, literally, the government is not doing its job. Why not? We have to get to the bottom of that.\u201d\n\nFiorina noted that many Europeans have visas but do not need to go through background checks.\n\n\u201cA lot of these would-be terrorists, probably, are coming through on European passports.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to the Rotarians, Fiorina reiterated her call for a three-page tax code and zero-based budgeting.\n\nShe also talked about her personal challenges in calling for the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, which she included in \u201ca whole set of laws and regulations that are crushing this economy.\u201d\n\n\u201cObamacare is the first, but it won\u2019t be the last,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a cancer survivor,\u201d Fiorina said. \u201cI\u2019m a pre-existing condition. And at the end of a long and difficult battle with cancer, two weeks later, we buried our younger daughter, to the demons of addiction.\n\n\u201cI understand that we have to invest more in drug addiction treatment, for example, or the prevention of drug addiction. But I also understand Obamacare is not working.\"\n\nShe said it should be replaced with state management of high risk pools and true competition in the health insurance market, \u201cand a mandate that every health care provider give you information you need, which includes the cost, the price and the outcome.\n\n\u201cI will tell you as a cancer survivor I had no idea whether the hospital I went to was better than the one 100 miles away,\u201d she said.\n\nFiorina said politicians have been debating immigration for 30 years, \u201cbut nothing gets done because politicians don\u2019t know how to get things done.\u201d\n\nShe said securing a border requires \u201cmoney, manpower and technology, but mostly it takes leadership.\u201d\n\nTaking aim at the national Democratic frontrunner, Fiorina said, \u201cHillary Clinton wants to run on anything but her record. She wants to run on anything but her policies. She wants to run on anything but the reality that she has gotten every foreign policy challenge wrong.\n\n\u201cShe wants to run instead on the historic nature of her candidacy,\u201d Fiorina said. \u201cIf I am up against her she will have to stand and be held to account for her lies about Benghazi, her email server, and on and on,\u201d Fiorina said.\n\n\u201cI understand what leadership is,\u201d Fiorina said. \u201cIt is not about talk. It is about results.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics", "ib-analytics": "data", "item-publish-date": "Thu, 10 Dec 2015 20:06:36 EST", "generator": "ibPublish 2", "author": "John DiStaso", "og": {"site_name": "WMUR", "description": "Carly Fiorina said Thursday she does not need to win the New Hampshire primary, but does need to exceed expectations, in order to remain in the presidential race for the long haul.", "title": "Fiorina's goal in NH: \u2018I need to exceed expectations\u2019", "url": "http://www.wmur.com/politics/fiorinas-goal-in-nh-i-need-to-exceed-expectations/36904518", "image": "http://www.wmur.com/image/view/-/36898380/highRes/1/-/maxh/630/maxw/1200/-/h77s8oz/-/Carly-Fiorina-1-12-10-jpg.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.wmur.com/politics/fiorinas-goal-in-nh-i-need-to-exceed-expectations/36904518", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "wmur://content/article/36904518", "iphone": "wmur://content/article/36904518", "googleplay": "wmur://content/article/36904518"}, "name": {"ipad": "wmur", "iphone": "wmur", "googleplay": "wmur"}, "id": {"ipad": 504646663, "iphone": 504646663, "googleplay": "com.hearst.android.wmur"}}, "site": "@wmur9", "card": "app"}, "al": {"android": {"url": "wmur://content/article/36904518", "app_name": "wmur", "package": "com.hearst.android.wmur"}, "ios": {"url": "wmur://content/article/36904518", "app_store_id": 504646663, "app_name": "wmur"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 98665743246}, "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.wmur.com/politics/fiorinas-goal-in-nh-i-need-to-exceed-expectations/36904518"}, "google-site-verification": "xTJFxn8Gm6mXV5ugnbTb198craV_CkoMGMqQyL4EfS4", "keywords": "Carly Fiorina, Commitment 2016", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/JohnDiStasoWMUR"}, "news_keywords": "Carly Fiorina, Commitment 2016", "description": "Carly Fiorina said Thursday she does not need to win the New Hampshire primary, but does need to exceed expectations, in order to remain in the presidential race for the long haul."}, "article_summary": "I need to exceed expectations in Iowa, and I need to keep going because this is a long race.\nCarly Fiorina said Thursday she does not need to win the New Hampshire primary but does need to exceed expectations in order to remain in the presidential race for the long haul.\nI need to exceed expectations in New Hampshire.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to do what I have to do in New Hampshire,\u201d she said in an interview with WMUR.com.\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying I\u2019m going to win New Hampshire."}
