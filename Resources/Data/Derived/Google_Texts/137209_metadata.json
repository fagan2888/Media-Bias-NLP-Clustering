Some 74% of such plans will not offer coverage of drugs in the gap next year, Avalere said.\n\n\u201cWhile beneficiaries will welcome lower premiums, they will need to look at other facets of benefit design, including how their medications are covered, cost-sharing responsibilities and total out-of-pocket spending,\u201d stated Christine Harhaj, senior manager at Avalere.\n\nAvalere noted a wide variance among the top plans. For example, a consolidated plan from Aetna (AET), called Aetna Medicare Rx Saver, will reduce premiums by 31% to $24.46, while WellCare Health\u2018s (WCG) Classic plan will go up by 52% to $31.46.\n\nThe two most expensive plans are Humana (HUM) Enhanced at $52.81, up 11% from 2014, and the AARP MedicareRx Preferred from UnitedHealth (UNH) at $50.15, up 16% over 2014, Avalere said. The latter plan is also the largest by number of enrollments, at nearly 3.8 million.\n\nHumana also has among two of the lowest-priced 2015 plans: the Humana Preferred Rx Plan at $26.40 and Humana\u2019s Wal-Mart (WMT) Rx Plan at $15.67.\n\nThe second largest plan by enrollment (at nearly 2.5 million), SilverScript Choice, will see average premiums fall by 21% in 2015 to $23.16, Avalere said. SilverScript Choice is offered by SilverScript Insurance, a CVS Caremark company, part of CVS Health (CVS).\n\nAnother plan from UnitedHealth, the AARP MedicareRx Saver Plus, will have an average premium of $28, Avalere said.\n\nAs for Medicare Advantage plans, Avalere found that the number of those plans will drop 3% amid continued government reimbursement cutbacks.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Monthly premiums for stand-alone Medicare Part D prescription drug plans will likely fall next year as a number of sponsors consolidate offerings into lower", "og": {"site_name": "Investor's Business Daily", "description": "Monthly premiums for stand-alone Medicare Part D prescription drug plans will likely fall next year as a number of sponsors consolidate offerings into lower-cost plans, according to a study release\u2026", "title": "Which Medicare Drug Plans To Be Less Costly In 2015?", "url": "http://www.investors.com/news/aetna-and-cvs-lower-2015-premiums-most/", "image": {"width": 512, "identifier": "http://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-ibd-favicon-v7.png", "height": 512}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "creator": "@IBDInvestors"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-ibd-favicon-v7-270x270.png", "date": "2014-09-22 13:09:00:-08:00", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-22T13:09:00+00:00", "modified_time": "-001-11-30T00:00:00+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "As for Medicare Advantage plans, Avalere found that the number of those plans will drop 3% amid continued government reimbursement cutbacks.\nHumana also has among two of the lowest-priced 2015 plans: the Humana Preferred Rx Plan at $26.40 and Humana\u2019s Wal-Mart (WMT) Rx Plan at $15.67.\nMonthly premiums for stand-alone Medicare Part D prescription drug plans will likely fall next year as a number of sponsors consolidate offerings into lower-cost plans, according to a study released Monday by Avalere Health.\nAs premiums decline, Avalere warns, Medicare Part D sponsors \u201cmay be shifting more cost-sharing responsibilities to beneficiaries.\u201d For example, the proportion of prescription drug plans with zero deductibles in 2015 will drop to 42% from 47% in 2014.\nSome 74% of such plans will not offer coverage of drugs in the gap next year, Avalere said."}
