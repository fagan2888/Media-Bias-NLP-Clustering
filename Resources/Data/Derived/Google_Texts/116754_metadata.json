Not know how to do basic stuff, like eat. Or read. Or math. Dumber than sack of hammers, really. Take labels on boxes and cans of food.\n\n\u201cNutrition Facts\u201d \u2014 you seen them. Black-and-white rectangle: Calories, total fat, cholesterol, carbs, protein, vitamins. All that stuff.\n\nPretty simple, right? Easy to understand? Not for dumb-o public! Just ask First Lady, Michelle Obama. Few days ago she explain why Washington changing those labels. First Lady went to college. Princeton. Harvard. Smart lady! But she grok what life like for us stupid folk. Here she tell what it like for typical numbskull American trying to read label we have now:\n\n\u201cSo you marched into the supermarket,\u201d she say. \u201cYou picked up a can or a box of something, you squinted at that little, tiny label \u2014 and you were totally and utterly lost. . . . All you could do was scratch your head, confused and bewildered, and wonder: Is there too much sugar in this product? Is 50 percent of the daily allowance of riboflavin a good thing or a bad thing? And how on Earth could this teeny little package contain five whole servings? . . . Unless you had a thesaurus, a calculator, a microscope or a degree in nutrition, you were out of luck. So you felt defeated, and you just gave up and went back to buying the same stuff you always buy.\u201d\n\nYup. So confused. So defeated. Brain hurt, go lie down.\n\nFirst Lady leave out part about putting food bags in back of \u201985 IROC-Z Camaro before stopping at discount cigarette store on way back to trailer park. Aside from that, though, she nail it.\n\nBut it not just her! Michael Jacobson agree. Him head of goody-goody group Center for Science in Public Interest. Last year he also explain why gummint need to fix nutrition labels. He say \u201clabel complexity\u201d big problem. Can \u201cleave many shoppers mystified.\u201d Simpler labels help \u201cencourage consumers to make smarter choices.\u201d\n\nThis how most media see it, too. \u201cChoosing healthier foods at the grocery store may soon be a little easier,\u201d say CNN. New labels be \u201ceasier to read,\u201d say \u201cToday\u201d show. And here Allison Aubrey, reporter for NPR: \u201cIf you\u2019re perplexed about how to make healthy choices when you\u2019re shopping for food, you\u2019re not alone. We\u2019ve all puzzled over a food label that was confusing and hard to follow.\u201d We sure have, Allison!\n\nIn another piece on \u201cAll Things Considered,\u201d Aubrey do riff on First Lady theme: \u201cYou pick up a box of pasta or a can of soup,\u201d she say, \u201cand there\u2019s just too much information to interpret.\u201d Boy howdy.\n\nBut no give up! Because, as Aubrey say next, \u201chelp is on the way. The FDA has redesigned the nutrition label with these problems in mind.\u201d\n\nWhew! Big relief. Getting scared there for a minute!\n\nNutrition labels good. Person putting hard-earned money down has right to know what he buy. (Or she buy.) Fraud bad. Nobody want to buy big box that say: \u201cContents: FOOD.\u201d Specially if contents really just powdered drywall. Or rat poison. Honesty best policy.\n\nBut still. Guess who design awful, complex, mystifying, puzzling current labels in first place? Federal gummint. FDA \u2014 same people who now say current labels no good! It was federal gummint tell everybody worry about fat, put fats at top of label so everyone pay close attention. Now federal gummint say forget fats. Now sugar bad! Bad, bad sugar! No eat!\n\nAlso, everybody hate Nutrition Facts serving sizes. Everybody know half-cup of ice cream not equal one serving; half-cup just a taste. One serving of ice cream equal one BOWL, darn it. Big bowl, if you have bad day.\n\nWell, who came up with stupid tiny serving sizes? Not evil food companies trying to trick poor little shoppers! Federal gummint did that. Based on \u201creference amounts customarily consumed,\u201d whatever that is. As 1991 New York Times article about new rules put it, \u201cthe F.D.A. will set uniform serving sizes for all foods.\u201d Now same people going to set new serving sizes.\n\nAnd hey, remember food pyramid? Two decades ago federal gummint introduce food pyramid to tell everybody to eat lots of carbs \u2014 six to 11 servings a day! Food pyramid say carbs should be foundation of your diet; tell people eat six to nine servings fruits and veggies. Now federal gummint say \u201cmake half your plate fruits and vegetables.\u201d\n\nOh.\n\nOdd thing about labels. Good to have them, but most folk don\u2019t pay them no mind. Carnegie-Mellon study of restaurant menu labels show \u201cpeople still choose the food they like, not what\u2019s supposed to be healthier,\u201d as news stories put it.\n\nMaybe real problem not \u201clabel complexity.\u201d Maybe real problem is, Americans not respond to gummint stimuli like trained rats in lab. Actually think for they own selves. Eat what they want, not what gummint tell them to.\n\nFunny \u2014 you\u2019d think pointy-headed know-it-alls smart enough to figure that out.\n\nThis article originally appeared at the Richmond Times-Dispatch.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://reason.com/archives/2014/03/10/big-government-will-help-you-eat-right", "site_name": "Reason.com", "type": "article", "description": "The busybodies know what\u2019s in your best interest.", "title": "Big Government Will Help You Eat Right"}, "twitter": {"site": "@reason", "description": "Americans so dumb.
