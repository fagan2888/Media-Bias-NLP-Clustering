Rick Scott in recent years, even as tax revenues have rebounded significantly. That may continue in 2015, despite a projected $1 billion surplus.\n\nHeading into the two-month legislative session that begins Tuesday, state leaders are talking about devoting much of the surplus to tax cuts and a few key programs, leading some to complain that many vulnerable populations dependent on state support are not sharing in Florida\u2019s economic rebound.\n\nScott\u2019s proposed budget calls for $677 million in tax cuts and big spending increases for K-12 education and certain environmental efforts. Funding for a wide range of programs such as Healthy Start would remain flat and others \u2014 including affordable housing initiatives \u2014 are slated for substantial cuts.\n\nScott won reelection promising to cut taxes, and his focus on the issue has coincided with a strong economic turnaround in Florida. But even some top Republicans are questioning the breadth of Scott\u2019s proposed cuts this year, and they could encounter resistance in the Legislature.\n\nThe issue will be one of the most closely watched of the 2015 session. It is further complicated by the fact that a large pot of federal money Florida has received to help cover health care costs for the poor may not be continued, which would put additional strain on the budget.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of moving parts right now,\u201d said Rep. Jim Boyd, R-Bradenton, who will have a big hand in shaping state spending as a member of the House leadership.\n\nTax cuts\n\nScott pledged during his campaign to cut taxes by $1 billion during the first two years of his second term.\n\nThe highlight of his tax package for the 2015-16 budget is a $470 million proposed reduction in the communications services tax paid on cell phone, cable, satellite television and certain land-line phone bills. It would save a family spending $100 per month on their cable and cell phone bills about $43 per year. Florida has one of the highest wireless taxes in the nation, according to the group TaxWatch.\n\nThe governor also wants to cut various business taxes and eliminate sales taxes on college textbooks, which would save college students $41.4 million annually.\n\n\u201cThe governor believes very strongly it\u2019s family\u2019s money, it\u2019s not government\u2019s money,\u201d said Scott spokeswoman Jackie Schutz. \u201cNow that we have a surplus we should be giving money back to families and making investments, and if you look at this budget we\u2019re doing both.\u201d\n\nScott\u2019s tax proposals have been warmly received by state legislators in the past. The governor\u2019s 2014 request for $500 million in reduced taxes and fees sailed through the Legislature.\n\nBut that was an election year, when Republican leaders were looking to give the governor a lift heading into a tough contest. They also were working with an even larger surplus.\n\nTop lawmakers have been coy about cutting taxes in 2015, refusing to commit to a dollar amount or specific types of reductions.\n\nSen. Bill Galvano, R-Bradenton, described Scott\u2019s tax cuts as \u201caggressive\u201d during a recent meeting of the pro-business Argus Foundation.\n\nBoyd agrees.\n\n\u201cI think his tax cuts are a little optimistic,\u201d the Bradenton Republican said, adding that, \u201cif there\u2019s reasonable tax cuts we can employ that can help advance Florida and our economy we\u2019ll certainly take a look at them.\u201d\n\nBut Boyd said the loss of $1.3 billion in federal funding that subsidizes health care costs for low-income individuals could scramble the budget equation. Federal officials have indicated the Low Income Pool funding will not be continued, a change contemplated as part of the Affordable Care Act, but the state is lobbying to keep the money.\n\n\u201cCertainly the LIP funding is a very important piece because if we have to fund it that\u2019s a fairly large number for our budget,\u201d Boyd said.\n\nBoyd also sees a lot of unmet state needs that could take priority over tax cuts.\n\nUnmet needs\n\nScott\u2019s budget provides record per-pupil funding for K-12 education and increases spending on land conservation and other priorities.\n\n\u201cHe is making incredible investments in state programs,\u201d Schutz said of the governor, noting his focus on education funding.\n\nBut many programs don\u2019t fare as well.\n\nSpending on transportation infrastructure would essentially remain flat at a time when the state is growing rapidly and road congestion is an increasing concern. Southwest Florida recently received a big boost when the state Department of Transportation agreed to fund a new Interstate 75 interchange at University Parkway, where a new mall and housing growth are leading to increasing gridlock.\n\nBut other big projects remain on the back burner. One of greatest unfunded priorities for the Sarasota/Manatee Metropolitan Planning Organization is the widening of River Road in Englewood and North Port. The narrow road is a safety hazard and a major concern for hurricane evacuations.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s much more need that funding,\u201d MPO executive director Michael Howe said of the state\u2019s transportation outlook.\n\nThe need for affordable rentals also is growing as the real estate market rebounds and prices rise.\n\nThe governor wants to cut housing funding by $68 million. A coalition that includes Realtors, builders and advocates for the poor is lobbying lawmakers to ignore the proposal and increase the affordable housing budget.\n\nOne often overlooked area of the budget that local lawmakers plan to emphasize this year is mental health treatment.\n\nBoth Galvano and Boyd have pledged to bring more attention to mental health issues.\n\nBoyd recently met with the head of Manatee Glens, a mental health treatment center in Bradenton. She convinced the lawmaker that allocating $300,000 toward bringing psychiatry residents to the area would increase the availability of mental health counseling and provide a critical service to the community.\n\nIt\u2019s not the only state program Boyd hopes to expand.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of needs that have been perhaps a little bit slighted over the past and we\u2019re going to be taking a look at those,\u201d he said.\n\nHealthy start\n\nShon Ewens said her \u201cheart sank a little bit\u201d when she saw the governor\u2019s budget recommendation for her agency.\n\nThe executive director of the Healthy Start Coalition of Sarasota County said there are many services for pregnant women and new mothers she would expand if the money were available, including breast feeding support, safe sleep awareness and mental health counseling.\n\n\u201cSo many of the root issues can be solved through some of that psycho-social counseling,\u201d Ewens said.\n\nState lawmakers boosted Healthy Start\u2019s budget by $3.1 million two years ago but the organization is pushing to recover all of the $8.2 million cut during the Great Recession and secure additional money for investigating infant deaths.\n\nWith 31,145 babies born prematurely in Florida in 2013, Ewens said the state is lagging in support for pregnant women and needs to do more, especially in a time of increasing state revenue.\n\n\u201cI hope some of that surplus would come to our families and our moms.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://politics.heraldtribune.com/files/2015/03/STAXwp.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}, "description": "Lawmakers are talking about devoting much of the surplus to tax cuts and a few key programs, leading some to complain that many are missing out on Florida\u2019s economic rebound.", "framework": "Alkivia Framework 0.8"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc14f\"", "article_summary": "That may continue in 2015, despite a projected $1 billion surplus.\nSen.
