Medicaid has paid the $90,000 medical bills she has accrued. She is photographed at her apartment building in Washington, D.C. on July 2, 2014. (Photo by Marvin Joseph/The Washington Post)\n\nHer love life was disrupting her health insurance. So the woman battling breast cancer weighed her options:\n\nA) Part with her boyfriend, her gainfully employed soulmate, to stay in Washington and keep her Medicaid benefits.\n\nB) Follow that boyfriend to Virginia, lose her Medicaid benefits and rack up hospital debt.\n\nC) Follow him to Virginia, get new medical insurance, keep up her cancer treatments and stay out of debt, simply by doing the one thing she swore she\u2019d never do again: get married.\n\nHealth-care incentives dictate a lot of Americans\u2019 decisions today. Some people cling to jobs they hate to keep their families covered; others work less than they could just to keep government coverage. The Affordable Care Act is only beginning to scramble those incentives and push them into more intimate choices.\n\nThat includes where people live \u2014 and maybe even whom they love, and how.\n\nLiz Church, 59, will lose her taxpayer-funded insurance plan if, come fall, she moves 20 miles from D.C. to Reston in order to stay with Bill Couette, her partner of 15 years. She will need to find and pay for new health care, some way, if she clings to her deep-rooted, life-worn belief that \u201cMarriage is awful.\u201d But if she marries Couette, she\u2019ll gain access to his private health benefits.\n\nTwenty-six states \u2014 and the District of Columbia \u2014 have accepted federal dollars, offered under the new health law, to expand Medicaid and provide no-cost care for a larger pool of low-income workers. The rest, so far, have said no thanks. In states that took the deal, unmarried adults under 65 who earn up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level, or about $15,000, qualify for the benefit. In the states that said no, the income threshold can be dramatically lower.\n\nVirginia has not expanded Medicaid. Church doesn\u2019t qualify there.\n\nHer dilemma \u2014 marriage or Medicaid? \u2014 has something to frustrate conservatives and liberals alike. It\u2019s born of the patchwork way the health care law has extended health coverage to low-income people across the country.\n\n***\n\nSeven months ago, two friends discovered suspicious lumps. We\u2019re getting to that age, Church thought. So she Googled, Where\u2019s the closest Mammovan? She found a mobile breast exam clinic \u2014 much cheaper than a doctor\u2019s appointment \u2014 in Southeast D.C., marked by a big pink ribbon.\n\nTwo weeks later, the letter came: We want to run another test, it said. Next was an ultrasound, an MRI, a biopsy. By February, the diagnosis: breast cancer, early stage.\n\nChurch, a chatty soul singer with wide green eyes, whose lacquered nails flash with each hand gesture, stood shocked. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019ll be in a Playboy spread anytime soon,\u201d she said finally, forcing a smile. \u201cI\u2019ll do whatever it takes.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Her dilemma \u2014 marriage or Medicaid? \u2014 has something to frustrate conservatives and liberals alike.\n\nBefore we go any further, a nurse told her, you need a health-care plan. She was uninsured. And as a part-time contracted nurse\u2019s aide, she made $14 an hour.\n\n\u201cI tried to get on Bill\u2019s insurance,\u201d Church said, \u201cbut they wouldn\u2019t let me.\u201d\n\nYou could get married, the nurse said.\n\nShe had been married \u2014 three times. At 19, Church wed her first husband in rural Illinois, where she grew up. He cheated on her. It ended 18 months later.\n\nHer second husband drank too much. They divorced when she was 29, with a 15-month-old son.\n\nHer third husband convinced her marriage was a curse, a spark killer. An Army officer, he took her to Cairo. The hotel phone rang: \u201cYour husband is having an affair,\u201d a voice said before abruptly hanging up.\n\nChurch was 39.\n\n\u201cThat was it,\u201d she said. \u201cI was done with that. People start feeling like they own each other. They mistreat each other. They take each other for granted.\u201d\n\n***\n\nThe afternoon of her diagnosis, Church, choking back tears, went to the Whitman-Walker Clinic in Northwest D.C., a public agency that guides uninsured patients to health coverage under the Affordable Care Act. She expected chaos. \u201cI tried to enroll in Obamacare twice,\u201d she told the staff. \u201cBut I couldn\u2019t get through the Web site. To be honest, I didn\u2019t think about it until \u2014 bam! I had cancer.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you bring recent pay stubs?\u201d asked a patient navigator.\n\nShe nodded.\n\nThe navigator determined Church was eligible for Medicaid under the state expansion. It did not matter that she lived with Couette, who earned much more, in an apartment complex with a pool on the roof, five blocks from the White House. They didn\u2019t share a child. She hadn\u2019t signed a lease.\n\nChurch\u2019s breast cancer treatment required at least four weeks of radiation, starting in June. Halfway through, her combined medical bills totaled nearly $100,000, she said. Her Medicaid plan covered it all: Xanax to help her sleep. A new pair of reading glasses. \u201cThis,\u201d she said, \u201cis so much better than any private plan I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d\n\nOn scented pink paper, she wrote a letter to the American Cancer Society: \u201cI expected to walk into a run-down clinic filled with homeless individuals. But to my surprise, as I walked up to the admissions desk in beautiful + clean surroundings, I was greeted with a huge smile and asked how they could help me.\u201d\n\nLife on the safety net is not so plush for many of America\u2019s 62 million Medicaid recipients. If the expansion passed in every state, half the people who would be eligible for coverage already subsist on food stamps.\n\nFour years ago, the District expanded Medicaid under Obamacare, and childless adult enrollment has increased from about 2,300 to 50,000, according to the Department of Health Care Finance. Single residents like Church qualify for the benefit if they make less than $2,042 a month. One in three District residents receive Medicaid.\n\nAcross the line in Virginia, where the expansion has not passed (despite Gov. Terry McAuliffe\u2019s contentious, ongoing push), Medicaid does not cover any adults without children. Republicans who oppose the expansion say it would give people more incentive to stay on welfare and that the costs \u2014 which the federal government will fund entirely for the first two years \u2014 will eventually burden state taxpayers.\n\nChurch hadn\u2019t thought about the country\u2019s health-care discrepancies until Couette said, \u201cHoney, we might have to move.\u201d\n\n\u2014\n\nLiz Church and boyfriend Bill Couette near Devil\u2019s Tower in Hulett, Wyo. Date not given. (Photo courtesy of Liz Church)\n\nAfter her third divorce, Church became a flight attendant, eager to explore the world on her own terms. That\u2019s when she met Bill Couette, a pilot in Dallas. They locked eyes on a flight to Lafayette, La. \u201cI hope he\u2019s not married,\u201d she remembers thinking.\n\nCouette was everything the other men weren\u2019t: smart, polite, respectful, loyal. His Minnesota accent betrayed a Midwest gentleness. \u201cI knew I found the one,\u201d Church says. \u201cIsn\u2019t he handsome? Isn\u2019t he sweet?\u201d\n\nFifteen years later, they still hold hands on strolls to the Lincoln Memorial. They ride motorcycles through Wyoming. They donate sacks of clothes to an apartment janitor whose family is growing. They cook pork chops and au gratin potatoes. They plan to retire together in his family\u2019s old cabin on a Minnesota lake.\n\nPeople ask: Why don\u2019t you get married already?\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to,\u201d Church says. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to. No one can make us.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know I love her,\u201d Couette chimes in. \u201cWe\u2019re a little too old to have children. I\u2019m staying with her through every trial, anyway. I will never walk away. I know that. So what\u2019s the point?\u201d\n\nThe law is a fairly big point, all the sudden. After nearly 30 years of flying planes, Couette is now a pilots\u2019 union representative. The union wants him to move to a larger Virginia office. The tentative deadline: October. Church would have to start all over. Last she checked, the cheapest private insurance plan she found cost $600 monthly.\n\nBy fall, her radiation should be done. But with cancer, she said, you never know. It could stay away. It could creep back. She needed an insurance plan, someway.\n\nRefusing to marry \u2014 or marry for readily available benefits \u2014 isn\u2019t cheating the system, Church says. It\u2019s asserting your freedom. It\u2019s your right as an American. Pick your dependency \u2014 the state, or a partner.\n\n***\n\nBy July, Church is half-finished with cancer treatments. Stage zero, it hasn\u2019t spread. The radiation, five days each week, makes her a little more tired. A little anxious. That\u2019s all she\u2019ll admit. She won\u2019t know for at least six months if it\u2019s working.\n\nShe tries to stay upbeat, dance with Couette at country concerts and find cheap plays around D.C. to keep her mind off the cancer, the future, what it all means.\n\nOn this evening, she\u2019s sporting a black cowboy hat, shooting a homemade iPhone video for a national retiree talent show. The best singer wins $5,000 and a trip to San Diego. Church performs \u201cCrazy\u201d by Patsy Cline in her apartment\u2019s rooftop pool bathroom. The acoustics there are better.\n\n\u201cWoo-rry, why did I let myself woo-rry?\u201d she belts. \u201cWooondering, what in the world did I doo-oo-oo?\u201d\n\nCouette stands outside the door, arms crossed, poised to explain to pool-dwellers: She\u2019ll be done in a second! Church loves that about him. He\u2019s there for all of her crazy plans \u2014 like the time they petted a tiger in Thailand or drove through a Minnesota blizzard to a bar on a Tuesday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m crazy for crying, and crazy for trying. I\u2019m crazy for loving you.\u201d\n\nShe will always choose Couette . Over Medicaid. Over certainty. Venturing into the unknown with him sounds better than chaining herself to an insurance plan. Even if it\u2019s the best one she\u2019s ever had.\n\nChurch has decided. She will B) follow her boyfriend to Virginia.
