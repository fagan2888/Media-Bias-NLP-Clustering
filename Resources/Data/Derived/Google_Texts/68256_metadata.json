But as the Lebanese architect and political satirist Karl Sharro joked, \u201cLibya introduces the simulacrum and wins the title.\u201d Indeed, even Baudrillard would probably be scratching his head about what went down in Tripoli today.\n\nJoshua Keating Joshua Keating is a staff writer at Slate focusing on international affairs.\n\nIt all started when Major General Khalifa Haftar, a central figure in the uprising against Muammar al-Qaddafi, gave a recorded statement to Reuters in which, wearing a military uniform, he declared that it was time for the military to \u201crescue\u201d the country and that \"The national command of the Libyan army is declaring a movement for the new road map.\u201d This seemed like a deliberate echo of the \u201croad map\u201d declared by Egyptian military leader Abdul-Fattah el-Sisi last July.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nAfter the statement, though, nothing much happened. No troops appeared to seize power, the government wasn\u2019t suspended, the new road map was nowhere to be seen.\n\nAli Zeidan, the prime minister, quickly declared that \"Libya is stable. The [General National Congress] GNC is doing its work and so is the government. The army is in its headquarters, and Khalifa Haftar has no authority,\" Zeidan told Reuters. \"No military units have moved to touch any institutions.\"\n\nUnlike in Egypt, there isn\u2019t really much of a military to carry out a coup in Libya, even if Haftar \u2013 a former Qaddafi loyalist who had been living in exile in for two decades Northern Virginia before the 2011 uprising -- were actually in a position to lead it. As the New York Times notes, \u201cthe Libyan military never had much cohesion even under Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, and it had splintered apart long before his ouster.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.tags": "coup libya", "sailthru.author": "Joshua Keating", "description": "In 1997, the Turkish military carried out what has become known as the \u201cpostmodern coup,\u201d forcing the government to resign without using troops or susp ...", "og": {"site_name": "Slate Magazine", "description": "In 1997, the Turkish military carried out what has become known as the \u201cpostmodern coup,\u201d forcing the government to resign without using troops or susp ...", "title": "What if You Threw a Coup and Nobody Came?", "url": "http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_world_/2014/02/14/libya_what_if_you_threw_a_coup_and_nobody_came.html", "image": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/the_world_/2014/02/14/libya_what_if_you_threw_a_coup_and_nobody_came/469361969-libyan-protesters-demonstrate-against-the-extended.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In 1997, the Turkish military carried out what has become known as the \u201cpostmodern coup,\u201d forcing the government to resign without using troops or susp ...", "creator": "@joshuakeating", "url": "http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_world_/2014/02/14/libya_what_if_you_threw_a_coup_and_nobody_came.html", "image": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/the_world_/2014/02/14/libya_what_if_you_threw_a_coup_and_nobody_came/469361969-libyan-protesters-demonstrate-against-the-extended.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "title": "What if You Threw a Coup and Nobody Came?", "site": "@slate", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-02-14T15:47:40Z", "sailthru.promoheadline": "What if You Threw a Coup and Nobody Came?", "sailthru.headline": "What if You Threw a Coup and Nobody Came?", "fb": {"app_id": 142011022527753}, "parsely-page": "{\n  \"title\": \"What if You Threw a Coup and Nobody Came?\",\n  \"link\": \"http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_world_/2014/02/14/libya_what_if_you_threw_a_coup_and_nobody_came.html\",\n  \"image_url\": \"http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/the_world_/2014/02/14/libya_what_if_you_threw_a_coup_and_nobody_came/469361969-libyan-protesters-demonstrate-against-the-extended.jpg.CROP.thumbnail-small.jpg\",\n  \"type\": \"post\",\n  \"post_id\": \"236140214003\",\n  \"pub_date\": \"2014-02-14T15:47:40Z\",\n  \"section\": \"News and Politics\",\n  \"author\": \"Joshua Keating\",\n  \"tags\": []\n}", "fb-share": "What if You Threw a Coup and Nobody Came?", "tw-line": "What if You Threw a Coup and Nobody Came?", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/Slate"}, "keywords": "coup libya", "google-site-verification": "jXqoqqPSmx_PWchRdG-IXu-X616Ee2Ptf_AiElI9LzQ", "sailthru.description": "In 1997, the Turkish military carried out what has become known as the \u201cpostmodern coup,\u201d forcing the government to resign without using troops or susp ...", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/the_world_/2014/02/14/libya_what_if_you_threw_a_coup_and_nobody_came/469361969-libyan-protesters-demonstrate-against-the-extended.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd75b\"", "article_summary": "No troops appeared to seize power, the government wasn\u2019t suspended, the new road map was nowhere to be seen.\nPhoto by ABDULLAH DOMA/AFP/Getty ImagesIn 1997, the Turkish military carried out what has become known as the \u201cpostmodern coup,\u201d forcing the government to resign without using troops or suspending the constitution.\nAli Zeidan, the prime minister, quickly declared that \"Libya is stable.\nThe army is in its headquarters, and Khalifa Haftar has no authority,\" Zeidan told Reuters.\nJoshua Keating Joshua Keating is a staff writer at Slate focusing on international affairs."}
