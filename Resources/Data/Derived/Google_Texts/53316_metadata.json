Obamacare brings Dems backlash\n\nMost Americans don\u2019t want to get rid of Obamacare. They just don\u2019t share its fundamental goal of universal coverage anymore.\n\nAnd not only did the political benefits that Democrats thought the 2010 law would eventually bring them not materialize, opposition has only grown, according to an analysis of multiple polls taken between 2010 and last month.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cThere have been backlashes, but never like this,\u201d said Robert Blendon, a professor at the Harvard School of Public Health and co-author of the analysis released Wednesday by the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nThat backlash doesn\u2019t appear directed at the mechanics of the law but at its underlying core principle.\n\nOnly 47 percent of Americans agree that it\u2019s the government\u2019s job to make sure everyone has health coverage, down from 69 percent in 2006, the analysis found. That shift is particularly pronounced among likely voters. Of those who are most likely to show up at the polls on Nov. 4, one in four believe in this principle.\n\nThe study includes a new poll of likely voters by the Harvard School of Public Health showing that while only 31 percent want to see Obamacare repealed, 23 percent want it scaled back. This coalition of Republicans and independents could represent a mandate for congressional efforts to diminish the sweeping overhaul four years after it was enacted \u2014 and with millions of people now covered under its provisions.\n\nThe debate is now \u201cabout whether or not you believe you want to get everybody covered,\u201d Blendon said. \u201cSomething happened on the way to the forum here that made that a much more controversial value.\u201d\n\nThe polling analysis is a snapshot of public opinion today and how it\u2019s changed in recent years, so it does not capture the cause of the shift. But Blendon, citing a study from Kantar Media that found Obamacare\u2019s opponents spent $418 million on 880,000 negative spots between the law\u2019s enactment in 2010 and May of this year \u2014 outpacing spending by supporters 15 to 1, says the ad factor is hard to ignore.\n\n\u201cThe scale of the negative advertising is of historic significance,\u201d Blendon said. In the past, on issues like Medicare, the big campaigns came before the controversial votes in Congress. But after the law was enacted, \u201cthey just went away,\u201d Blendon said. That hasn\u2019t happened with the ACA.\n\nAmericans believed in the universal coverage principle by wide margins through most of the 2000s, according to the analysis, peaking in 2006. But by 2009, as the Obamacare debate intensified, only 47 percent said they believed it was government\u2019s job, and that figure has hovered in place since then. Blendon speculated that ads criticizing the law\u2019s impact on jobs and the middle class might have made people who supported universal coverage in principle decide the \u201cside effects\u201d aren\u2019t worth it. Opinions about the law\u2019s effects tend not to be driven by personal experience: 56 percent said the law hasn\u2019t affected them directly.\n\nBlendon and his co-author, John Benson, analyzed 27 polls from 14 different news organizations conducted between 2007 and this year. Harvard also conducted its own survey of 1,596 likely voters Sept. 10-28, in some cases adopting questions and likely voter measures from other national polls to ensure comparability.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "The reaction doesn\u2019t appear directed at the mechanics of the law but at its core principle.", "title": "Obamacare brings Dems backlash", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/10/obamacare-backlash-112312.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/10/29/141029_obamacare_gty_605.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Obamacare,Elections,Health Care,Democrats,2014 Elections,Affordable Care Act", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "The reaction doesn\u2019t appear directed at the mechanics of the law but at its core principle.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcda6a\"", "article_summary": "Obamacare brings Dems backlashMost Americans don\u2019t want to get rid of Obamacare.\nThey just don\u2019t share its fundamental goal of universal coverage anymore.\nAmericans believed in the universal coverage principle by wide margins through most of the 2000s, according to the analysis, peaking in 2006.\nThat shift is particularly pronounced among likely voters.\nHarvard also conducted its own survey of 1,596 likely voters Sept. 10-28, in some cases adopting questions and likely voter measures from other national polls to ensure comparability."}
