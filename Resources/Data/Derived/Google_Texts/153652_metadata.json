But the blockbuster story of the cycle has to be the one that purported to prove that \u201cillegals\u201d are stealing our elections. This was based upon a study conducted by Old Dominion University political science professors Jesse Richman and David Earnest, in which they extrapolated from census figures and self-reported statistics on illegal immigration that 6.4 percent of the votes cast in 2008 (or 1.2 million people) were by undocumented immigrants and 2.2 percent in 2010.\n\nThe study\u2019s methodology was immediately called into question by other political scientists, and the authors themselves played down the significance of their findings. Nonetheless this story sent a wave of excitement through right-wing circles we haven\u2019t seen since the Tea Partyers donned tricorn hats and started storming town halls five years ago with the likes of Breitbart.com declaring that this study gave credence to Phyllis Schlafly\u2019s Eagle Forum\u2019s dire warnings about legal immigration destroying America by destroying the Republican Party:\n\nThe Eagle Forum report concluded that, though \u201cRepublican outreach to Asian and Latino voters\u201d is \u201ccritical,\u201d Republicans \u201ccan never turn liberal-leaning immigrants and their adult children into supporters of limited government faster than the current high level of legal immigration (one million a year) is bringing in new liberal voters.\u201d The report found that new immigrants \u201cand their adult children are significantly more liberal than the average American voter on a host of policy issues, including the size of government, Obamacare, affirmative action, gun control, greater environmental regulation, and other issues championed by the Left.\u201d\n\nThis is one case where they are admitting outright that they want to suppress the vote:\n\nThe report found that new immigrants \u201cand their adult children are significantly more liberal than the average American voter on a host of policy issues, including the size of government, Obamacare, affirmative action, gun control, greater environmental regulation, and other issues championed by the Left\u2026 Thus, if future immigration is not reduced, it will be virtually impossible for Republicans to remain nationally competitive as a conservative party.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s refreshingly honest. They know immigrants are hostile to their agenda so they want to stop immigration. Good to know.\n\nBut in the midst of all this caterwauling about illegal immigrants stealing elections and vote fraud and ballot box stuffing, guess who\u2019s simultaneously demanding that voting laws be broken so their people can vote against gay rights on Election Day? It would be unbelievable if it weren\u2019t so common for the right wing to do exactly what it accuses the other side of doing.\n\nIn August, opponents of Houston\u2019s recently enacted Equal Rights Ordinance (HERO) reportedly submitted more than the seventeen thousand signatures needed to qualify put the measure on the November ballot. However, upon review of the petition under the City Charter, City Attorney David Feldman determined that thousands of the signatures failed to meet the legal requirements set by local and state law for a voter referendum\u2026 On November 2, thousands of conservatives met in Houston at the \u201cI Stand Sunday\u201d rally to demand that the city government allow for a public vote on the ordinance, despite the failure of the repeal petition. The event, which was hosted by the anti-gay hate group Family Research Council (FRC), was widely promoted by Fox News and featured speeches from Fox\u2019s Todd Starnes and Mike Huckabee. At the rally, speakers demanded that the city of Houston \u201clet the people vote\u201d on the ordinance, accusing openly gay Mayor Annise Parker of violating the religious liberty of HERO\u2019s opponents by refusing to count their improperly collected signatures.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Conservatives worry about election integrity -- except when \"sacred\" churches endorsing candidates come into play", "title": "Christian right\u2019s illegal ploy: Why they\u2019re electioneering from the pulpit \u2014 and getting away with it", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Conservatives worry about election integrity -- except when \"sacred\" churches endorsing candidates come into play", "title": "Christian right\u2019s illegal ploy: Why they\u2019re electioneering from the pulpit \u2014 and getting away with it", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/11/04/christian_rights_illegal_ploy_why_theyre_electioneering_from_the_pulpit_and_getting_away_with_it/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/brown_mcconnell_tillis.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Conservatives worry about election integrity -- except when \"sacred\" churches endorsing candidates come into play", "title": "Christian right\u2019s illegal ploy: Why they\u2019re electioneering from the pulpit \u2014 and getting away with it", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/brown_mcconnell_tillis.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Heather Digby Parton", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Christianity, Editor's Picks, Gay Rights, GOP, IRS, James O'Keefe, law, pastors, Religion, Republicans, Tea Party, The Right, The Tea Party, Voter Fraud", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd717e\"", "article_summary": "But the blockbuster story of the cycle has to be the one that purported to prove that \u201cillegals\u201d are stealing our elections.\nBut in the midst of all this caterwauling about illegal immigrants stealing elections and vote fraud and ballot box stuffing, guess who\u2019s simultaneously demanding that voting laws be broken so their people can vote against gay rights on Election Day?\nThe study\u2019s methodology was immediately called into question by other political scientists, and the authors themselves played down the significance of their findings.\nThey know immigrants are hostile to their agenda so they want to stop immigration.\nIt would be unbelievable if it weren\u2019t so common for the right wing to do exactly what it accuses the other side of doing."}
