(AP) \u2014 Connecticut\u2019s Department of Insurance is playing a major role in a deal that could create the nation\u2019s largest health insurer, leading a 26-state review of Anthem Inc.\u2019s proposed merger with Bloomfield-based Cigna.\n\nSince Cigna is based in Connecticut, state insurance regulators are tasked with coordinating the review by other states with legal Cigna entities within their borders, informing them about Connecticut\u2019s evaluation of the massive merger, and hosting conference calls between the various state regulators.\n\n\u201cThis transaction has a large number of states,\u201d said Connecticut Insurance Commissioner Katharine Wade. \u201cHaving 26 states involved, coordinating among regulators, is significant.\u201d\n\nThe application process for the proposed merger includes multiple steps, including approvals from shareholders. The U.S. Justice Department is currently reviewing Anthem\u2019s planned $54.2 billion acquisition of Cigna to determine whether the merger will hurt competition and consumers. About 53 million customers could be affected.\n\nUltimately, regulators in the 26 states will issue final approvals after considering issues such as the amount of local competition and the companies\u2019 financial conditions. In the U.S., states decide how insurers conduct business and what new companies can enter the market. State regulators may impose some conditions on the deal.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to make sure if these two companies come together, that there\u2019s enough competition, that there are enough other players in the marketplace,\u201d Wade said. Her agency plans to hire an independent economist to review market competition issues and assist the Department of Insurance team.\n\nConnecticut Attorney General George Jepsen\u2019s staff is also reviewing the proposal for possible anti-trust issues.\n\nOn a joint website about the deal, the two insurers said they are \u201cconfident that state regulators will see the merits of the transaction and that they will approve it.\u201d\n\nThe top Senate Republican on the Connecticut General Assembly\u2019s Insurance and Real Estate Committee, Kevin Kelly, has questioned why Wade, a former Cigna vice president, didn\u2019t recuse herself from the process. Wade\u2019s husband is also Cigna\u2019s associate chief counsel for litigation in its law department.\n\nWade contends she can participate in the process fairly and objectively. She submitted a letter to the Office of State Ethics spelling out her role in the review process and saying she no longer owns any shares of Cigna stock. She said her husband holds only unvested shares that will be placed in a blind trust when vested. Wade said Cigna has formally recused her husband from any matters involving her agency.\n\nA public hearing is planned in Connecticut, likely next year, on the merger. The first part of the application, a whopping 3,000 pages, was posted last week to the Department of Insurance website. Besides interest from customers, the two companies employ thousands in Connecticut who will likely be paying attention to the proceedings. Anthem\u2019s local subsidiary in Wallingford has about 1,400 workers while Cigna employs about 4,200 in the state.\n\nAnthem\u2019s application states it has \u201cno current plans or proposals to reduce in any material respect the number of employees employed by the Cigna companies.\u201d\n\nConnecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal has voiced concerns about the Anthem/Cigna merger, as well as Aetna\u2019s proposed $35 billion deal for Humana. At a recent Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, he said the Department of Justice should scrutinize the mergers together to determine their combined effect on the overall health insurance marketplace. If approved, the two mergers would reduce the number of insurance giants from five to three.\n\n\u201cAt its core, these two mega-mergers threaten higher prices through rising premiums and other costs to consumers. It\u2019s really that simple,\u201d Blumenthal, the state\u2019s former attorney general, told The Associated Press.\n\nThe insurers have said these combinations will help them save money by reducing overlapping costs and improving technology. On the joint website, both said \u201cthe marketplace is, and will remain, highly competitive, and customers will continue to have a wide range of competitors to choose from.\u201d\n\nBlumenthal urged state officials \u201cto be as expansive and creative as possible\u201d in their interpretation of their authority when reviewing the deal.\n\n\u201cThey have a stewardship responsibility, a public trust in protecting consumers,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "anthem, cigna, insurance merger, connecticut", "generator": "WordPress.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=488522642", "og": {"site_name": "WTNH Connecticut News", "description": "Connecticut\u2019s Department of Insurance is playing a major role in a deal that could create the nation\u2019s largest health insurer, leading a 26-state review of Anthem Inc.\u2019s proposed \u2026", "title": "Connecticut agency to play key role in Anthem/Cigna merger", "url": "http://wtnh.com/2015/10/03/connecticut-agency-to-play-key-role-in-anthemcigna-merger/", "image": {"width": 512, "identifier": "https://lintvwtnh.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/2015-10-03-insurance-merger.jpg", "height": 341}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Connecticut\u2019s Department of Insurance is playing a major role in a deal that could create the nation\u2019s largest health insurer, leading a 26-state review of Anthem Inc.\u2019s proposed \u2026", "title": "Connecticut agency to play key role in Anthem/Cigna merger", "image": {"src": "https://lintvwtnh.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/2015-10-03-insurance-merger.jpg?w=640"}, "creator": "@WTNH", "site": "@wtnh", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "anthem, cigna, insurance merger, connecticut", "msapplication-tooltip": "Connecticut News, CT Weather, Conn Traffic and Roads", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.linmedia.newstouch.wtnh", "fb": {"pages": 48010180735}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://wtnh.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/4eb8f03fcc8a8756ac275dd34c27b214?s=16", "application-name": "WTNH Connecticut News", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WTNH8", "published_time": "2015-10-03T21:15:11+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-03T21:15:11+00:00"}, "msvalidate.01": "25404283363C09DE121A55A903F03873", "google-site-verification": "ZhFDO7qoefSEo7HNtJIuKwhzd9Scb3I7EiPvU_GALiE", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Connecticut's Department of Insurance is playing a major role in a deal that could create the nation's largest health insurer, leading a 26-\u2026"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8432\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThis transaction has a large number of states,\u201d said Connecticut Insurance Commissioner Katharine Wade.\nState regulators may impose some conditions on the deal.\nHer agency plans to hire an independent economist to review market competition issues and assist the Department of Insurance team.\n\u201cHaving 26 states involved, coordinating among regulators, is significant.\u201dThe application process for the proposed merger includes multiple steps, including approvals from shareholders.\nThe U.S. Justice Department is currently reviewing Anthem\u2019s planned $54.2 billion acquisition of Cigna to determine whether the merger will hurt competition and consumers."}
