Sure there were highlights, but the lows were particularly low. And we're not just talking about the pothole epidemic in Abilene.\n\nFrom the Paris terrorist attacks in January to more racial upheaval, this time in Baltimore in April and in November at the University of Missouri, to the late-year terrorists attacks in San Bernardino and again in Paris, we sadly were not surprised by bad news because it came so often.\n\nNews that made front-page headlines that might have been forgotten:\n\nA bus carrying prisoners crashed on icy Interstate 20, killing 10 \u2014 including the driver and a corrections officer \u2014 and injuring five west of Abilene in January.\n\nChris Kyle Day was held Feb. 2 in Austin. The movie about the man who grew up in the Stephenville area, \"American Sniper,\" failed to win the Academy Award for best picture but it topped $350 million at the box office. Kyle was shot to death at a gun range Feb. 2, 2013.\n\nThe Reporter-News in March joined Journal Media Group, which in October was targeted for acquisition by Gannett Inc. That deal, if approved by the shareholders and federal regulators, would be completed in the first quarter of 2016.\n\nA woman died in early May when a tornado struck the Cisco area.\n\nMarching bands from seven Big Country high schools advanced to the UIL state contest in November. Cooper High School took third at its area contest, coming up one place short of going to San Antonio.\n\nAmong the decisions or, at least, discussions coming out of City Hall, were a possible teen curfew, OK of a bike master plan and approval of moving the south-side library to the Mall of Abilene.\n\nTaylor County commissioners were solid in support of displaying \"In God We Trust\" at the courthouse but Police Chief Stan Standridge said his department would not join others in Texas with displaying the motto on vehicles.\n\nThe Texas Supreme Court met in November in Abilene, hearing two cases. Justice Jeffrey Boyd is a 1983 Abilene Christian graduate.\n\nIt was a year of retirement, or pending retirement. Longtime and hugely successful Abilene High School football coach/athletic director Steve Warren retired. Warren guided the Eagles to the 2009 state championship, the school's first since a three-year title run in the 1950s.\n\nFifteen-year Rehab Center leader Woody Gilliland retired from that post, though he still has a key role in that organization.\n\nLongtime and respected local TV journalist Wayne McCormick retired in late June after 23 years at KTXS. (Hopefully, we got the facts right, Wayne)\n\nMeanwhile, two-time Hardin-Simmons University President Lanny Hall announced his retirement in May 2016.\n\nIt was in with a new city manager and a president/CEO for the Abilene Chamber of Commerce.\n\nIt was a weird weather year. It rained 8.26 inches on July 7, setting a one-day record. The year's total was near 40 inches by year's end. It did not hit 100 until July 29. It was 64 degrees Christmas Day, and hit 71 Saturday before the wintry weather set in.\n\nRain fell for us personally. We shed a lot of tears, for sure.\n\nThe community was stunned with the sudden death of Brian Green, 56, the owner of Cypress Street Station but, more importantly, an all-in community guy \u2014 an \"Abilene icon,\" Mayor Norm Archibald toasted him. Another sudden death was that of Judge Sam Carroll, County Court-at-Law No. 2. The 68-year-old judge crashed while riding his bike in the Tour de Gap event in late July and died in hospice care after hospitalization.\n\nThe death of longtime sports writer Bill Hart, 83, touched many \u2014 those who knew him personally and those who enjoyed, for decades, his stories spun with a down-home style. For months, coaches, players, fans and friends recounted to the Reporter-News the impact he had on the Big Country and personally.\n\nA Hart column in October 2014 was about Doug Neece, the father of two Albany High School football players (and four boys total). Neece gamely was battling cancer, and the playoff-bound Lions drew inspiration from their No. 1 fan to advance to the state finals that year. Neece, 44, died the day the 2015 playoffs started, and the Lions again carried forth with even more dedication to win for him. Against the odds, the Lions again gained the state finals.\n\nOther notable deaths include West Texas Rehabilitation Center super fan Danny Isbell, Brown County Sheriff Bobby Grubbs, former Abilene Mayor Dale Ferguson and Steve Fehr, the founder of Fehr Foods, now AbiMar, a business success story for more than 20 years.\n\nWe did laugh a little, despite ourselves.\n\nAbilene went nuts for and, yes, came on down to the Civic Center for \"The Price Is Right\" traveling show.\n\nSpeaking of nuts, how many bags of pecans did you take to get shelled or turn in for cash? It was a banner year.\n\nIn late August, residents for two hours addressed the City Council, which was considering updating the city's animal ordinance. It eventually did not, to howls of delight. Council members Bruce Kreitler and Steve Savage dressed up for the meeting, wearing themed ties (roosters for Savage and dogs for Kreitler).\n\nOnly in Abilene would there be brown water in the toilet, and it wasn't what you'd think.\n\nSpeaking of toilet water, effluent water began flowing into Lake Fort Phantom Hill and, surprise, no one has died or even gagged \u2014 including the affluent.\n\nHere now are what Reporter-News editors considered the top 10 stories of the year.\n\n1. AISD fallout/recovery\n\nThe free fall and the resurrection of the Abilene ISD began in late December 2014, when Holland Medical High School dean Michael Trook told school officials he had an inappropriate relationship with a 17-year-old female student. Trook resigned and was arrested.\n\nThe new year began with more bad news \u2014 Abilene High School teacher Breanne Nicole Brown was accused of an inappropriate relationship with a 16-year-old male student. She also quit.\n\nThe incidents were bad enough, but the Abilene Police Department accused Superintendent Heath Burns and others on his staff with interfering with their investigations. Worse, did AISD officials know about Brown's relationship and not inform police before a final inappropriate act?\n\nIn February, Burns resigned. He was named sole finalist for the superintendent's job with the Blooming Grove ISD, near Waco. That bounce-back bid ended, however, when it came out that he also had obtained medications by fraud and was arrested. Eventually Burns was given three years's probation, a fine and his educator's license in Texas was revoked for life.\n\nTrook pleaded guilty to a charge of improper relationship with a student, a second-degree felony. He was sentenced to 10 years adjudicated probation, 15 days in jail, a $2,500 fine and surrender of his teacher's certificate.\n\nLater, Associate Superintendent Mark Neal, who's the school district's in-house attorney and responsible for Human Resources and Student Services, was ordered to enter a \"pretrial diversion program.\" He'll be supervised for 12 months by a representative of the district attorney's office.\n\nAnd AHS Principal Jennifer Raney would be temporarily reassigned to a downtown job while her role in the Brown case was determined. She was cleared of wrongdoing, returned to the AHS campus but in December announced her retirement.\n\nJust as the 2015-2016 school year was to start, the AISD announced Cooper High grad and Pampa ISD Superintendent David Young had been hired to lead the 17,000-student district. Young soon may be working with new faces on the school board. Four are up for election in May, Place 7 member Kelvin Kelley stepped down in December and former President Stan Lambert is running for the state Legislature.\n\n2. The name is bond\n\nThe Abilene City Council reduced the price tag on its May bond election to just over $80 million, allowing the Abilene ISD's 2013 bond total of $87.1 million to remain the largest in city history.\n\nAlthough it was a lot of money, voters approved all nine propositions. The most money, almost $46 million, was targeted for street repairs \u2014 more specifically, the 25 projects deemed the most pressing. Later, it was discovered that amount did not include what water and sewer line work might be associated with the project.\n\n\"Apparently, there wasn't coordination between the streets department and the water department,\" said new City Manager Robert Hanna, who promised that the city won't fix a street and then tear it up again to fix water lines underneath it.\n\nAlso approved were the addition of four splash pads and construction of an aquatic park, upgrades to the Civic Center and zoo, construction of new fire stations and a police record-keeping facility, airport improvements, funding for sidewalks and the first phase of the Cedar Creek Waterway project.\n\nAlso that day, Wylie ISD residents approved $15 million in bonds to add classrooms to the high school and build a performing arts center.\n\n3. Weather REPORT\n\nYou'd think we would've had a white Christmas with all the rain we had this year. Heading into Christmas Day, Abilene had received almost 38.5 inches \u2014 the most in 45 years, and the fourth most on record.\n\nThis comes a year after Abilene measured 15.02 inches \u2014 the second lowest amount in the same 45-year stretch. We sent Christmas cards to El Ni\u00f1o.\n\nIn late December, Lake Fort Phantom Hill was at 88 percent capacity, a rise so dramatic that every-other-week watering restriction were eased back to weekly. Other lakes are full or nearly so. Even Lake Abilene, which a hiker could trek across last fall, is listed at 19 percent full.\n\nIs the drought over? We know better than to think that, which is why plans continue to move forward to build a reservoir northeast of Abilene, recycle water and find other sources to ensure future needs.\n\nIf we needed a reminder about our fickle weather, consider that from July 8 through Oct. 21, we received 1.80 inches of precipitation \u2014 106 days. Then Oct. 22-23, we got 5.29 inches.\n\nWhen it does rain in Abilene, it pours.\n\n4. Dyess in the news\n\nThere are years that not much news comes out of Dyess Air Force Base. This year was not one of them.\n\nThe biggest news was tragic \u2014 a Dyess-based C-130 crashed on takeoff from an airfield in Afghanistan, killing all 11 on board and two more people on the ground. Among the dead was the four-man Dyess crew, TORQE 62 \u2014 Capt. Jordan Pierson, Capt. Jonathan Golden, Staff Sgt. Ryan Hammond and Senior Airman Quinn Johnson-Harris. The men, all with the 317th Airlift Group, were hailed as heroes at local services, and condolences were sent from as far as the White House.\n\nThere was good news, though.\n\nDyess opened its gates in May to host an airshow featuring the famed Thunderbirds. They did two shows, both under blue skies. That weekend, the World's Largest Barbecue was held in a hangar on base. It was the 50th barbecue by the Military Affairs Committee of the Abilene Chamber of Commerce for military and their families.\n\nCol. Michael Bob Starr announced early retirement plans so that he could meet the filing deadline to make a run for U.S. Congress. Col. David Benson succeeded Starr.\n\nAnother Dyess leader departed \u2014 Col. Brian Yates retired and took the position of vice president of the chamber, heading the Military Affairs Committee.\n\nDyess' mission changed this year. On Oct. 1, the 7th Bomb Wing switched from Air Combat Command to Air Force Global Strike Command. The transition places responsibility for B-1s, B-2s and B-52s under a single command, and likely will cut deployments though not at the expense of global response.\n\nAlso in 2015, Lt. Col. William Dyess, for whom the base is named, was honored posthumously by Gov. Greg Abbott, who awarded the World War II hero the state's Legislative Medal of Honor. An online petition effort was launched to award Dyess the Medal of Honor.\n\n5. POLITICAL SHAKE-UP\n\nThere was a whole lotta shakin' goin' on in 2015, not all blamed on fracking.\n\nThe exit of Gov. Rick Perry in 2014 set off an across-the-board change in state leadership. The same situation occurred closer to Abilene this year.\n\nU.S. Rep. Randy Neugebauer announced he is retiring after six elections to Congress, setting off a scramble to represent District 19. The job interested Dyess AFB commander Starr so much that he put in for retirement to run for office. Eight other Republicans also are seeking the office.\n\nLongtime state Sen. Troy Fraser is retiring from District 24, setting off a flood of hopefuls for that job. The job interested State Rep. Susan L. King so much that she announced she would step away from her District 71 post to run. Five other Republicans and a Democrat are seeking the office.\n\nThat plan was put on hold for several weeks when King suspended her campaign to be treated for chronic depression. The day before the filing deadline, her office announced that King would run for Senate.\n\nThe open House seat interested people so much that five Republicans and one Democrat signed up as candidates.\n\nState Rep. Jim Keffer also announced he would not run in 2016. Keffer, of Eastland, represents District 60.\n\nEven closer to home, the City Council changed dramatically when Steve Savage rebounded from a previous election defeat to soundly beat Joy Ellinger for a vacated spot on the council. Then, local tree service owner Bruce Kreitler felled incumbent Joe Spano in May.\n\nTaylor County Commissioner Stan Egger is retiring, sparking interest in that one of five seats on the court.\n\n6. AS THE CITY TURNS\n\nThe City Council change was just part of the ongoing local leadership shift.\n\nAbout two years after coming to Abilene, chamber president/CEO Jason Smith departed for Oklahoma and Doug Peters, who held the same post with the Fayetteville, North Carolina, chamber came to West Texas.\n\nKent Sharp, formerly of Gainesville, completed his first year as the head of the Development Corporation of Abilene. Sharp, who was named to the DCOA post in late July 2014, recently was named a board member of the Texas Economic Development Council.\n\nRobert Hanna was hired in April to succeed Larry Gilley as city manager of Abilene. Hanna came to town from Denison, where he had been city manager since 2011.\n\nThe city shake-up reverberated on down.\n\nDeputy City Manager David Vela, a finalist for Gilley's job, departed for Alice to lead that city.\n\nHanna elevated Mindy Patterson and James Childers to assistant city manager posts. Patterson was director of finance since 2008 and Childers director of community services since 2012.\n\nJon James, the city's planning director, headed south to San Angelo after 11 years working for the city of Abilene. His wife, Theresa, took the city attorney's job there. She had been the assistant here.\n\nRecently, Dana Schoening was announced to follow him in that job at year's end.\n\nAlso gone is City Attorney Dan Santee, who took a job in San Antonio. Santee had been in his job here since 2007. His wife, Megan, stepped away from the job as director of public works in July.\n\n7. DON ALLEN KILLING\n\nAbilene Police Department officer Don Allen was found dead Aug. 31 in his Clyde home.\n\nDetails of his death were sketchy early on. He was remembered fondly at a service at Beltway Park Church in south Abilene, a service attended by law enforcement representatives from across the state.\n\nGruesome details of his death soon emerged, however, as did questions. There was no forced entry. Allen, 27, was found bound. Personal and police items were taken, including his gun, baton and badge.\n\nPolice sought two suspects, who were arrested. A Callahan County grand jury 85 days after Allen's body was found indicted Phillip (29) and Violet (30) Walter on charges of first-degree felony murder, second-degree felony robbery and third-degree felony theft of a firearm. They are accused of \"choking, strangling, otherwise impeding the breathing of Don Allen,\" according to court records.\n\nThe couple, both still jailed, said there was communication with Allen before his death.\n\nA trial date tentatively was set last week \u2014 May 2. It's not known which suspect will be tried first.\n\n8. STATING OUR CASE\n\nAbilene State Supported Living Center lives on.\n\nAmid news that a troubled facility in Austin would be closed, those in cities where other campuses are located feared they would be next.\n\nState Rep. Susan King reassured those in District 71, which includes Taylor County, that the Abilene facility was not identified as a specific target. Still, she and state Sen. Troy Fraser were taking no chances.\n\nA commission tasked with eliminating \"waste\" in state government spending stood down on plans to shut down these living centers, formerly called state schools. The 13 centers operate on a yearly budget of $662 million.\n\nThe Abilene facility serves about 350 residents and employs more than 1,300, making it one of the largest employers in our city. It also serves a great need, one that proponents believe should not be relegated to off-campus homes or other means.\n\nThe Texas State Sunset Commission announced in July 2014 that it recommended six of the 13 state supported living centers be closed. The only facility mentioned by name in the announcement was the Austin State Supported Living Center.\n\nIn May, a bill out of the Senate that in part outlined the closure plan did not pass before its deadline, largely because of House obstruction. It was King's amendment to the bill that derailed a broader plan to sunset the Texas Department of Aging and Disability Services.\n\n\"We felt like that was the right thing to do,\" said King, who was not opposed to other parts of the bill, but not at the expense of closing living centers.\n\n9. Cheap gas\n\nNot even the summer blend of unleaded gas was very expensive.\n\nIf you get royalty checks in the mail, have a job in the oil and gas industry or are trying to figure how much tax money generated from oil and gas revenue is going to flow into the state's \"Rainy Day Fund,\" the low price for crude was not good. But for those going to the pumps, a prices of $1.69 per gallon at some local pumps the day before Christmas has been welcome news.\n\nThe average price at Abilene pumps in April 2011 was $3.79 per gallon. The last price above $3 was early October 2014.\n\nThe price slipped to $1.81 before rebounding to $2.59 in mid-June before reversing course again to dip under $2 in mid-September. It has been there since. The average low of $1.81 recorded this month in Abilene is the lowest in recent memory.\n\nIt's not just in Texas. A national cartoonist noted Santa was opting to drive this year \u2014 it's faster and the stereo is better \u2014 and give the reindeer the night off.\n\n10. Affordable marriage licenses.\n\nOK, we're mixing two controversial national issues, but both had \u2014 and will have \u2014 impact on Abilene and Taylor County.\n\nThe Supreme Court in June went back to back with decisions on the Affordable Care Act and same-sex marriage.\n\nIn a 6-3 vote, the court, upheld what's often called Obamacare as a means to provide health care to more Americans \u2014 about 6.4 million of them.\n\nOpponents cite the crippling effects on small-business and the High Court's effort, in their, to fix a broken plan.\n\nIn a 5-4 vote, the court rules that government recognition of marriage and couple benefits extend to gay and lesbian couples. Opponents said that shouldn't be the court's call.\n\nSoon after, a marriage license was processed at the Taylor County Courthouse for a same-sex couple.\n\nThese two stories, like many others from 2015, will continue in the new year.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\u00a92015 the Abilene Reporter-News (Abilene, Texas)\n\nVisit the Abilene Reporter-News (Abilene, Texas) at www.reporternews.com\n\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\n\n_____\n\nTopics: t000002458,t000027866,t000149877,t000027879,t000002776,t000166569,t000002953,t000047704,t000407386,t000409574,t000002537,t000396078,t000003817,t000040348,t000141113,t000029726,t000181590,t000003007,t000165515,t000002707,t000032885,t000038454,t000410581,t000002925,t000040464,t000032881,t000003060,g000362661,g000065562,g000066164,g000065598,g000222672,g000065627,g000224421", "article_metadata": {"description": "Is there anything more to remember about 2015 other than \"The Force Awakens?\"The new \"Star Wars\" movie dominated our attention at year's end, whether we wanted it to or not.We needed a movie like \"Star Wars\" because nationally and locally, it was a trying year.
