PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) â€” A wind farm planned for off the coast of Block Island has been given the final OK by the federal government.

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is the lead federal permitting agency for the project. Deepwater Wind said Friday the agency approved the Block Island Wind Farm and the project is now fully permitted. Nine state and federal agencies reviewed it.

Deepwater Wind plans to build five turbines off the island and a transmission cable between the island and Narragansett.

An application for a right of way in federal waters for the transmission cable is still under review by the federal government. Deepwater Wind says it expects an approval soon.

Deepwater Wind plans to begin construction offshore next summer and begin operating the wind farm in 2016.
