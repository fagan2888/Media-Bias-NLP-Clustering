Late-night talk show host Bill Maher on Friday railed against a Black Lives Matter protester who targeted Hillary Clinton at a campaign fundraising event this week, saying she and other Black Lives Matter activists need to remember that Mrs. Clinton is not the racist here.

He accused the protesters of acting “purer” than everyone else and wondered whether the protester who targeted Mrs. Clinton realized that a significant percentage of GOP front-runner Donald Trump’s supporters disagree with the Emancipation Proclamation.

“This is who you’re going after? This is where we start the battle? You f***ing idiots!” Mr. Maher said, Mediaite reported.

Georgetown Professor Michael Eric Dyson pushed back, arguing that no one called Mrs. Clinton a racist but instead activists were pointing out that her husband’s policy of mass incarceration, which she advocated, had negative consequences for black people.

He also noted that Mrs. Clinton apologized for calling black criminals “super predators” in a speech she made about mass incarceration in the 1990s.

Mr. Dyson argued that it is sexist for people to punish Mrs. Clinton for the actions of her husband during his presidency.

Actor Mark Ruffalo jumped in and said Black Lives Matter protesters were trying to hold Democrats accountable as the party that is supposed to be on the side of the black community, but “has let them down continuously,” Mediate reported.

Mr. Maher still argued that Black Lives Matter activists were making a mistake by going after Mrs. Clinton.

“People need to learn the difference between an imperfect friend and a deadly enemy,” Mr. Maher said. “You want to tear Hillary Clinton down? Great. Then enjoy President Trump.”
