For the fourth day in a row, we had an earthquake.

Not a big one. Not enough to tump over the patio furniture. But big enough to get Twitter’s attention.

Tonight’s was a 2.8-magnitude — equal to Thursday afternoon’s 2.8, just a touch less powerful than early Friday morning’s 2.6 and well above the 2.1 that rattled Luna Road in Northwest Dallas Saturday morning without anyone noticing. (There was another 2.1 Friday morning as well.)

Sunday’s rumbled through at 6:27 p.m., and it was back on the Irving side of the fault line, more or less between MacArthur High School and the Four Seasons.

It was a strange one too — the sound that tends to precede these quakes lasted a little longer than usual. It wasn’t the usual boom; it was more like a long, low rumble, at least in Northwest Dallas.

And it only took the U.S. Geological Survey 10 minutes to track and post it to the website, which is so SoCal.
