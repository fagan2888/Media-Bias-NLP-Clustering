The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) paid nearly $300,000 for HIV drugs to go to 158 Medicare part D beneficiaries who are already dead.\n\nA new Inspectors General report puts the tab directly at the aching feet of taxpayers. In some cases, multiple prescriptions were filled for a single dead person.\n\nThis may just be the tip of the zombie iceberg, however: The report looked only at one year and only at HIV drugs, \u201cwhich account for one-quarter of one percent of all Part D drugs in 2012,\u201d the report said.\n\nRelated: Obamacare Could Face Large Numbers of Dropouts\n\nDrugs used to treat HIV are expensive and \u201ccan be a target for fraud, waste and abuse\u201d \u2013 yet \u201cthe issues raised are relevant to all Part D drugs,\u201d the report noted. The financial impact across the $85 billion-a-year Medicare prescription program known as Part D was not calculated in the report but clearly could be in the millions or beyond.\n\nWhile Medicare has been working to curb prescription drug reimbursements to deceased patients, it clearly \u201chas come up short,\u201d as Government Executive put it, which further explained it this way:\n\nBecause sponsoring pharmacies working with Medicare Part D too often submit payment reports outside the 32-day window following a patient\u2019s death, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services paid for HIV drugs for more than 150 deceased beneficiaries \u2026 [The IG,] using prescription drug purchases in 2012 and cross-checking them against the Beneficiary Enrollment Database and the Social Security Administration\u2019s Death Master File, found that Medicare paid for 348 HIV drugs for 158 deceased beneficiaries serviced by 124 pharmacies\u2014at a total cost of $292,381.\n\nSome 37 million Americans use the Medicare Part D system \u2013 and earlier reports have shown the federal government to have wasted millions of dollars in reimbursements to people who had already died.\n\nRelated: Taxpayers Treat DHS Workers to $30K of Starbucks\n\nCMS has an editing system in place that\u2019s supposed to reject records for drugs \u201cwith dates of service more than 32 days after death,\u201d the IG report said. Most of the drugs were dispensed by retail pharmacies, the report indicated. \u201cAccording to CMS, it is possible that \u2013 because of delays in receiving death information \u2013 it will accept a PDE [prescription drug event] with a date of service that is after the 32-day window,\u201d said the report.\n\nThe IG has suggested that CMS either reduce or cut the 32-day window; CMS has agreed.\n\n\u201cAfter reviewing this report,\u201d wrote administrator Marilyn Tavenner, \u201cCMS has had preliminary discussions with the industry to revisit the need for a 32-day window, which was instituted because the date of service in some pharmacies reflects the date the prescription was filled, not the date the prescription was dispensed.\u201d Discussions are ongoing.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "If you think zombies have taken over America \u2013 \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d gets roughly", "title": "\u2018Zombies on Drugs\u2019 Cost Taxpayers Nearly $300,000", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/11/03/Zombies-Drugs-Cost-Taxpayers-Nearly-300000", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/slideshows/03272013_class_zombies.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/11/03/Zombies-Drugs-Cost-Taxpayers-Nearly-300000", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/slideshows/03272013_class_zombies.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@maurmack"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "If you think zombies have taken over America \u2013 \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d gets roughly", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd6be\"", "article_summary": "The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) paid nearly $300,000 for HIV drugs to go to 158 Medicare part D beneficiaries who are already dead.\nThe IG has suggested that CMS either reduce or cut the 32-day window; CMS has agreed.\nThis may just be the tip of the zombie iceberg, however: The report looked only at one year and only at HIV drugs, \u201cwhich account for one-quarter of one percent of all Part D drugs in 2012,\u201d the report said.\nIf you think zombies have taken over America \u2013 \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d gets roughly 17 million viewers per episode \u2013 here\u2019s more proof.\nA new Inspectors General report puts the tab directly at the aching feet of taxpayers."}
