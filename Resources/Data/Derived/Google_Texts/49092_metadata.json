A former staffer at the libertarian Institute for Humane Studies, she talked recently with Reason TV about Amazons, academics, and adventure. Watch that here or scroll down to the bottom of this article.\n\nHow can a freedom-loving writer make the greatest impact for liberty in the world today? For me, the chosen path has always been through fiction. Even as I pursued a doctorate in the history of ideas in my native Denmark, I realized I had neither the encyclopedic training nor the passion for cool logic\u2014not to mention the nerve\u2014to follow in the footsteps of classical liberal philosophers and economists such as Robert Nozick, Friedrich Hayek, and Milton Friedman.\n\nIn my case, the desire to explore themes of freedom and human action led inescapably to the novel. For as long as I can remember, I have endeavored to physically and emotionally inhabit my interests\u2014moments in history as well as ideas\u2014rather than treating them as objects on display. And there is no question that the novel has the potential to attract and influence scores of readers who are not necessarily predisposed to agreeing with the underlying philosophy. Classic examples are the widespread and continuing readership for Orwell\u2019s Animal Farm, as well as\u2014obviously\u2014the works of Ayn Rand.\n\nWithin the realm of fiction, it is always tempting to set one\u2019s stories in a dystopian future, where all our misgivings about state power can be shown in full force. In the current book market, however, an aspiring Rand or Orwell risks being labeled as a writer of science fiction or fantasy and relegated to the themed side-shelves in the vast mass-market paperback jungle. Don\u2019t get me wrong. That can be a great place to be, and a good libertarian author may well be able to grow a keen following of like-minded fans. But one\u2019s chances of ending up on the front table, rubbing spines with Dan Brown and Nora Roberts, are quite slim.\n\nTo build a significant audience among the educated female readers who make up the overwhelming majority of American book buyers, an author is generally better off working within the genres we know as literary and historical fiction (two examples are Kathryn Stockett\u2019s wildly popular The Help, and Jamie Ford\u2019s now-classic Hotel on the Corner of Bitter and Sweet). These are traditionally the kind of books that show strong sales over time, and they also\u2014in contrast to science fiction, crime and mystery, and romance\u2014have a greater chance of becoming staff picks and book-club favorites. That sort of viral marketing does not just increase sales but influence with both readers and publishers.\n\nTo the freedom-friendly novelist, one further advantage of historical fiction is that the entire history of mankind is jam-packed with tragic examples of what Hayek called \u201cthe fatal conceit\u201d and the corrupting effects of power\u2014especially state power. Thus the author need not invent a world and infuse it with political philosophy ex nihilo. The world is already there, firmly based on research, and you don\u2019t have to exercise much poetic license to illuminate the evils of statism and the heroic nature of the freedom fighter throughout human history. For example, my first novel, Juliet, is partly set in medieval Siena and based on the historical situation that informed Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. It was a time torn between emperor, pope, and corruption and nothing is easier than to let one of the present-day characters speak the glaring truth: \u201cThe devotion of the old neighborhood militia was essentially what made the Sienese republic possible. If you want to keep the bad guys in check, make sure the good guys are armed.\u201d\n\nIn my new novel, The Lost Sisterhood, the classical liberal subtext is everywhere apparent. The action alternates between contemporary England and North Africa and the Bronze Age Mediterranean world of Myrina, the legendary first queen of the Amazons. Our modern-day male hero is explicitly libertarian, and the lost sisters of my title are not lost at all. Freedom fighters that they are, the Amazons have simply chosen to live outside established society. I had much fun creating scenes where the ancient world foreshadows modern life\u2014that is, life within the impudent, groping embrace of the state\u2014and it is my hope that readers will feel a twinge of outrage at situations such as this one, in which Myrina returns to her companions with five hard-won copper tokens in order to pay the fee for staying overnight at the harbor in Crete:\n\n\u201cWait!\u201d she cried, striding down the gangplank to the outer dock where the boat was moored. \u201cHow many copper tokens to stay the night?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat depends,\u201d said the man. \u201cWhat do you have?\u201d\n\nMyrina opened her fist and showed him.\n\n\u201cAh,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s say two, then. Plus two for tomorrow.\u201d\n\n\u201c ?\u201d Kyme stepped forward, her face still flushed from the argument Myrina had missed. \u201cCan we not pay those in the morning?\u201d\n\nThe fee collector shook his head. \u201cThen you must leave at sunrise. But you won\u2019t be able to. Not the way that north wind is blowing.\u201d\n\nWelcome to income-based taxation and installment payments.\n\nHistorical novels\u2014especially bestsellers\u2014are also more likely to appeal to filmmakers, which opens up the possibility of a whole new audience for one\u2019s ideas and themes. Traditionally, the theme of liberty has primarily found its way to the silver screen via dystopian narratives set in the future (such as the graphic novel V for Vendetta), but I suspect that is primarily due to the scarcity of libertarians in the field of historical fiction. It\u2019s true that it\u2019s just as likely that the libertarian ideas might not make the transition to screenplay in perfect condition, but at least the hype surrounding a film release will draw new readers back to the original book (as happened, for instance, with Jim Harrison\u2019s Legends of the Fall, an anti-war, anti-Prohibition novella after it was made into a 1994 movie starring Brad Pitt).\n\nSo historical fiction is one of the best avenues through which a freedom-friendly novelist can reach a wide and varied audience.\n\nA novel is not a philosophical or economic argument, of course, and I don\u2019t write fiction to convince people that, say, the minimum wage hurts the poorest, lowest-skilled workers (which it does) or that airline deregulation was a good idea (which it was). A novel is, hopefully, the starting point of a conversation, one in which the author engages readers and asks that they see things from a different point of view than they might otherwise. The author creates an alternative world in which the readers invest their time and their emotions. The payoff is not conversion to an ideological position but a heightened awareness of different possibilities, often via an empathetic, visceral reaction to injustice.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "A best-selling writer explains the power of historical fiction.", "title": "The Lost Sisterhood and the Case for Libertarian Novels", "url": "http://reason.com/archives/2014/04/08/the-case-for-libertarian-novels", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/mc/ngillespie/2014_04/annefortier2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@reason", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/mc/ngillespie/2014_04/lostsisterhood.jpg", "description": "Editor\u2019s Note: Anne Fortier is\nThe New York Times best-selling author of \nJuliet (2010), and her new novel, \nThe Lost Sisterhood, came out in March.
