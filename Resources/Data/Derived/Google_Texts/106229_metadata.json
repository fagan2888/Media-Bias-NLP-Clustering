But at the start of the administration, Kissinger saw it as Nixon\u2019s idea and repeatedly derided it. The president\u2019s 1967 Foreign Affairs article had said it was unwise to leave China out of the global mainstream. Kissinger was dubious. After hearing Nixon explain his strategy, the new national-security adviser called it a \u201cflight of fancy.\u201d When White House Chief of Staff H. R. Haldeman reminded him that the president really wanted to visit China in his first term, the man who thereafter treated the initiative as his greatest achievement simply scoffed. \u201cFat chance,\u201d Kissinger replied. He later wrote that he and Nixon had hit on the idea \u201cindependently.\u201d But the record doesn\u2019t support his claim. When Kissinger\u2019s secret trip to Beijing was arranged in 1971, the president was full of self-congratulation. \u201cJesus, this is a hell of a move,\u201d he said. And when the trip went well, Nixon\u2019s reaction was completely proprietary. \u201cI told you so,\u201d he exulted to Kissinger. \u201cI told you so!\u201d\n\n\u2014 Adapted from Maximalist: America in the World From Truman to Obama, by Stephen Sestanovich (Knopf, February 2014)", "article_metadata": {"description": "A very short book excerpt", "author": "Stephen Sestanovich", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "A very short book excerpt", "title": "Taking Credit for China: Nixon vs. Kissinger", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/static/b/theatlantic/img/default-thumbnail.png", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2014/03/very-short-book-excerpt/357578/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda2d8\"", "article_summary": "Rapprochement with China was such a celebrated breakthrough that Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger never stopped vying for the credit.\nBut at the start of the administration, Kissinger saw it as Nixon\u2019s idea and repeatedly derided it.\nHe later wrote that he and Nixon had hit on the idea \u201cindependently.\u201d But the record doesn\u2019t support his claim.\nThe president\u2019s 1967 Foreign Affairs article had said it was unwise to leave China out of the global mainstream.\n\u201cI told you so!\u201d\u2014 Adapted from Maximalist: America in the World From Truman to Obama, by Stephen Sestanovich (Knopf, February 2014)"}
