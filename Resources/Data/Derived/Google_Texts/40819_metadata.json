Chris Christie lit into Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.) for giving the same damn speech over and over again, no matter what the question, because he's simply not qualified to be president.\n\nChristie's been making the case for weeks that Rubio isn't ready for the White House.\n\n\"You have not been involved in a consequential decision where you had to be held accountable,\" he said. \"You just simply haven't.\"\n\nRubio fired back at Christie over New Jersey's credit rating being downgraded nine times. But then, he transitioned into an unrelated speech about President Barack Obama's agenda. It was one that he had given moments earlier, but why not do it again.\n\n\"Let's dispel with this fiction that Barack Obama doesn't know what he's doing. He knows exactly what he's doing,\" Rubio said. \"He is trying to change this country. He wants America to become more like the rest of the world. We don't want to be like the rest of the world; we want to be the United States of America.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ouch.", "sailthru.expire_date": "2016-02-07 21:33:52 -0500", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "Ouch.", "title": "Chris Christie Is Over Marco Rubio's Same Old 25-Second Speech", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/chris-christie-marco-rubio_us_56b6a33ae4b01d80b2469676", "image": "http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/2000_1000/56b6a4d71a00009c01ab2231.jpeg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Ouch.", "creator": "@jbendery", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/2000_1000/56b6a4d71a00009c01ab2231.jpeg", "height": 1000}, "title": "Chris Christie Is Over Marco Rubio's Same Old 25-Second Speech", "site": "@HuffPostPol", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2016-02-06 21:33:52 -0500", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=us_56b6a33ae4b01d80b2469676", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "Chris Christie,Marco Rubio,Elections 2016,2016 election,gop debate,republican debate", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "Chris Christie,Marco Rubio,Elections 2016,2016 election,gop debate,republican debate", "published_time": "2016-02-06 21:33:52 -0500", "modified_time": "2016-02-07 11:36:27 -0500", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/huffpostjenbendery"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "article_summary": "Chris Christie lit into Sen.
