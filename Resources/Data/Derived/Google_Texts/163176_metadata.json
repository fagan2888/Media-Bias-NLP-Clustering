But she sent a clear signal on Friday that she was not planning to cede any ground to her liberal rival.\n\nWhile New Hampshire has long been hospitable to the Clinton family \u2013 her husband called himself \u201cthe comeback kid\u201d after finishing second in the primary here in 1992, and she won the 2008 primary \u2013 Mrs. Clinton\u2019s appearance here came as Mr. Sanders has been surging in the polls.\n\n\u201cI will fight hard against what I see as the injustice and unfairness in our society,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said, discussing her record and seemingly mindful of Mr. Sanders as she did. \u201cI take a back seat to no one when you look at my record of standing up and fighting for progressive values.\n\nMrs. Clinton delivered the unbridled defense of her record as she addressed a crowd estimated by her aides at more than 850 in Hanover, the leafy New Hampshire town that is home to Dartmouth College.\n\nMrs. Clinton\u2019s aides have struggled since before she announced her candidacy with the reality that her sky-high early poll numbers would be almost impossible to sustain. They have sought to diminish the expectations for her, and have sought to avoid chasing distractions.\n\nThe Vermont border is just across the Connecticut River from Hanover, and several attendees at Mrs. Clinton\u2019s event on Friday said they were either from Vermont and were curious, or were supporting Mr. Sanders.\n\nMrs. Clinton\u2019s speech demonstrated the challenge she faces: She must keep a wary eye on Mr. Sanders without attacking him, but she must also seem engaged and rouse her supporters, so attacks on the Republican field on issues like the Affordable Care Act have been her approach.\n\nShe kept to that script here on Friday, warning that a Republican president would repeal the health care law, and she denounced the administration of George W. Bush for \u201cpoor management\u201d of the economy that led to the recession.\n\n\u201cI will defend it and I will do everything i can to improve it,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said of Mr. Obama\u2019s signature health care law, calling it an issue of \u201cfairness and humanity, also of economics\u201d and praising the Supreme Court for recently upholding it.\n\nRepublican calls for \u201crepeal, repeal, repeal mean nothing \u2013 unless they elect a Republican president,\u201d Mrs. Clinton warned, saying ominously, \u201cIf the country elects a Republican president, then they will repeal the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nHer voice rising at times, Mrs. Clinton called for new gun control laws as she spoke in a state where many residents own guns. And she sounded a note of muted praise for a potential nuclear deal with Iran, while vowing to defend her record on \u201cprogressive values\u201d against anyone.\n\nHolding a microphone as she spoke from the stage at The Bema, an amphitheater-style spot near the college campus \u2013 where, according to a Clinton aide, the high school graduation of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s Vermont-bred campaign manager, Robby Mook, took place \u2013 she said that Republican policies had a history of failure.\n\n\u201cThen Democrats have to come in and fix what\u2019s broken,\u201d she said, noting that at the end of her husband\u2019s two terms there was a \u201csurplus that would have paid off the national debt had it not been rudely interrupted by the next administration.\u201d\n\nRepublicans \u201cjust don\u2019t know the theory of original sin, because we wouldn\u2019t have had to have a recovery if we hadn\u2019t had the kind of poor management and bad economic policies that put us into the ditch in the first place,\u201d she said to applause.\n\nMr. Obama, she said, \u201cdeserves a lot more credit than he\u2019s usually given\u201d for pulling the economy back.\n\nShe also pledged to continue discussing gun control, saying, \u201cWe have to work very hard to muster the public opinion to convince Congress\u201d to support universal background checks for gun buyers.\n\n\u201cI think it is the height of irresponsibility not to talk about it, so I will talk about it,\u201d she said.\n\nAs for Iran, Mrs. Clinton walked a careful line. She said she supported the Obama administration in its efforts to get a deal to curtail Iran\u2019s nuclear capabilities, calling it a \u201csingular step in the right direction,\u201d but warned that such a deal would not change the fact that Iran was an \u201cexistential threat to Israel.\u201d\n\nAfter the speech, Mrs. Clinton visited the Dairy Twirl ice cream parlor in the nearby town of Lebanon, where she was asked by a reporter about the large crowds that Mr. Sanders has been drawing. \u201cI always knew this was going to be competitive,\u201d she said.\n\nBut Mrs. Clinton, who was introduced at the Dartmouth event by a campaign organizer, acknowledged that organization was a failure of her 2008 campaign and said her team was focused now on organizing around the country \u2014 the clear implication being that she did not intend to be surprised this time around.\n\n\u201cOne of the things I certainly learned from the last campaign is how important it is not just to have events but to organize every single day, including around the events,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20150703173513, "BN": "first-draft", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us/politics/firstdraft", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/first-draft/post", "per": "Bush, George W;Clinton, Hillary Rodham", "org": "Dartmouth College", "keywords": "Bush George W,Clinton Hillary Rodham,Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Presidential Election of 2016,Dartmouth College,Uncategorized", "description": "Hillary Rodham Clinton warned that a Republican president would repeal the Affordable Care Act, and she denounced the administration of George W.
