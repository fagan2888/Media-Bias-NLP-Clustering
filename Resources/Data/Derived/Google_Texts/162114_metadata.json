Real Rebels respect ART!\" to protest the leak.\n\n\n\nThe new batch of leaked songs includes a collaboration with Pharrell Williams titled \"Back That Up (Do It).\"\n\n\n\nIn the wake of unauthorized release of the first batch of tracks, Madonna spoke with several media outfits to air her frustration.\n\n\n\n\"It's thrown us all into overdrive. We're having to think outside the box. Think on our feet. I didn't plan to put my record out this way,\" she told Billboard.\n\n\n\n\"Obviously there is a person, or a group of people, behind this that were essentially terrorizing me,\" she said. \"I don't want to sound alarming, but certainly that's how I felt. It's one thing if someone comes into your house and steals a painting off your wall: that's also a violation, but, your work, as an artist, that's devastating,\" she told The Guardian.\n\n\n\n\"I'm an artistic person, I'm very expressive. I'm sorry if words alarm people, but that's what it felt like. It was not a consensual agreement. I did not say 'hey, here's my music, and it's finished.' It was theft,\" she continued.\n\n\n\nIn response to the first leak, Madonna released six official tracks from \"Rebel Hear\" last week. The 56-year-old entertainer plans to release the album in full in March 2015.\n\n\n\nAccording to Idolator, the following are the titles of the tracks that were leaked this week:\n\n\n\nIconic\n\nVeni Vidi Vici\n\nBeautiful Scars\n\nFreedom\n\nGod Is Love\n\nHold Tight\n\nBest Night\n\nInside Out\n\nTragic Girl\n\nNothing Lasts Forever\n\nBack That Up (Do It) ft.
