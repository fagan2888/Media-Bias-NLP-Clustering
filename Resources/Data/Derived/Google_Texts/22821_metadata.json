In emergencies, her office can file a separate motion for a hearing within 24 working hours.\n\nA children\u2019s advocacy organization also is working with county officials to make it easier for children in foster care to get necessary medical treatment.\n\n\u201cAt what level we are going to be seeking legislation or policy practice change will depend on the research that we get,\u201d Denise Tanata Ashby, executive director for the Children\u2019s Advocacy Alliance, said on Thursday.\n\nAshby\u2019s organization recently launched the Stakeholder Opinion Survey to find ways to improve Nevada\u2019s child welfare system.\n\n\u201cWhen we get responses that we feel are policy issues, we take it to the department and have a discussion with them,\u201d she said.\n\nThe 7-month-old\u2019s death was such a case.\n\nOBTAINING ADVANCE CONSENT\n\nThe Children\u2019s Advocacy Alliance is looking at how other agencies handle parental consent for medical treatment. One option is getting broad parental consent at the beginning of a Family Services case.\n\nAnother option is expanding the decision-making scope of foster parents and of the agency.\n\nJeanne Marsh, director for the Washoe County Children\u2019s Services Division, said her agency has parents sign medical releases when their children are removed from the home. The medical release is also addressed during the 72-hour emergency child protective hearings.\n\n\u201cThe judge states the order out loud so that parents are aware, and then the parents get a copy of the orders,\u201d she said.\n\nBut it\u2019s the department\u2019s practice to include parents in any medical situation when possible, Marsh said.\n\nIn the case of the 7-month-old girl who died in Clark County, the foster mother took the ailing baby to the hospital, but doctors needed to run a test to treat her, which required consent from the biological mother.\n\nFamily Services couldn\u2019t locate the biological mother and told Smith it would take two weeks to get a court order for the needed procedures, the foster mother said in July.\n\nHospital staff conducted the procedure after seven days because the infant was in serious decline, Smith said. The baby later died.\n\nJanice Wolf, directing attorney for the Children\u2019s Attorneys Project at Legal Aid of Southern Nevada, said she didn\u2019t know the specifics of the 7-month-old\u2019s death, but noted there was another option \u2014 filing an \u201cemergency setting slip\u201d to get cases in front of the court quickly.\n\n\u201cWhile it\u2019s nice to do motions, I don\u2019t understand why a slip wasn\u2019t used,\u201d she said.\n\nWolf believes current medical consent practices in Clark County do work. But part of making them work in cases like that of the 7-month-old girl is effectively communicating the urgency of the situation.\n\n\u201cIt sounds like someone didn\u2019t realize how urgent it was,\u201d Wolf said.\n\nLIABILITY VERSUS NEED\n\nThe medical consent practices in Clark County have been in place since the early 2000s. At the time, a couple of parents became upset because the Nevada Division of Child and Family Services sought medical treatment for foster children when parents thought they should have been consulted, Duffy explained.\n\nSince the current medical consent policy was put in place, \u201cthere\u2019s been some really tough days,\u201d she said.\n\nIn a few circumstances, a parent was responsible for their child\u2019s medical problems through abuse or neglect. While the parent faced criminal charges, the hospital wanted a decision on do not resuscitate orders, Duffy said.\n\n\u201cIf we make that decision, that could be the (difference) between attempted murder and murder,\u201d Duffy said.\n\nDuffy met with the grieving foster parents of the 7-month-old girl but couldn\u2019t talk about case specifics because the district attorney\u2019s office represents Family Services. The agency is not commenting on details of the girl\u2019s death.\n\nFamily Services also would not comment on what\u2019s being done to improve current medical consent practices. Officials referred the Review-Journal to a July statement released when the baby\u2019s death was first reported. The statement reiterated the department\u2019s current policy.\n\nThere also are liability issues officials have to consider.\n\n\u201cIf we make those gigantic leaps into saying this more-than-routine medical procedure is needed and something happens, and we, being the department, consent to it without a court (order), then the liability falls on the department and not onto the court,\u201d she said.\n\nThere might also be some hesitation on the part of hospitals to proceed without parental or court consent because of liability issues, Ashby said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s got to be a balance between protecting both the agency and the medical providers, but also making sure the kids are getting the medical care they need when they need it,\u201d she said.\n\nDr. Jay Fisher, head of University Medical Center\u2019s pediatric emergency department, said he speaks to the hospital\u2019s lawyers about their practices frequently and there\u2019s a great latitude in the law to do what\u2019s right for patients.\n\n\u201cIt would be highly unusual to look at a team of professionals and say that they were neglectful or guilty of some type of incorrect activity\u201d for providing a life-saving measure to a child, he said.\n\nUnder state statute, the director or other authorized representative for a child welfare agency should organize one or more multidisciplinary teams to review the death of a child in several circumstances, including if the child dies while in custody of the agency.\n\n\u201cThe statute does not require an additional team to be convened,\u201d Kristi Jourdan, Family Services spokes\u00adwoman, said last month when asked if a team was formed to review the death of the 7-month-old girl. \u201cThe current Clark County Child Death Review Team process, which reviews every child death in our community, already meets the statutory requirements, according to the district attorney\u2019s office.\u201d\n\nTara Phebus with the Clark County Child Death Review Team said she couldn\u2019t talk about specific cases, but the team meets monthly to review all child deaths.\n\nDuffy would like to see the court move away from the current medical consent practices because of their complexity.\n\n\u201cI recognize that parents have rights and they are fundamental rights, regard\u00adless of how these kids landed in the system, but at some point, I would like to see the courts say the department has this ability and trusts the department to make these decisions,\u201d she said. \u201cBut that\u2019s not going to be a popular stance because parents have rights.\u201d\n\nIt would be ideal if parents stayed in constant communication with Family Services, but that\u2019s not the case, Duffy said.\n\n\u201cThe district attorney\u2019s office will find a way to help the department attain the ability to have more control over those decisions,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll keep working with the courts to figure out a better process.\u201d\n\nContact Yesenia Amaro at yamaro@reviewjournal.com or 702-383-0440.
