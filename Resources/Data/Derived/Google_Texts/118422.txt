Friedman: Our politics aren't keeping up Thomas Friedman says U.S. politics has failed to find a sensible common ground. Barack Obama offered an opportunity to do so; Trump does not.

When the U.S. military trains fighter pilots, it uses a concept called the OODA loop. It stands for observe, orient, decide, act. The idea is that if your ability to observe, orient, decide and act in a dogfight at 30,000 feet is faster than the other pilot's, you'll shoot his plane out of the sky. If the other pilot's OODA loop is faster, he'll shoot you out of the sky. For a while now, it's been obvious that our national OODA loop is broken - and it couldn't be happening at a worse time.
