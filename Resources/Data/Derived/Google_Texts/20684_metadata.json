Orrin G. Hatch, chairman of the Finance Committee and president pro tempore of the Senate, demanded the inspector general investigate the recalcitrant taxpayers and look at the IRS\u2018 own systems for trying to track down tax cheats when it comes to Obamacare.\n\nHe said the number of delinquents was \u201castounding.\u201d\n\nIRS Commissioner John Koskinen alerted Congress to the 710,000 potential cheats in a memo Friday, in which he outlined his agency\u2019s early experience with Obamacare\u2019s first full year of operation in 2014.\n\nAll taxpayers were required to file their returns or to request an extension by April 15, and about 7.5 million of those are expected to have claimed a tax credit for buying Obamacare plans, either collecting the credit throughout the year or asking for a reimbursement when they filed this year.\n\nMr. Koskinen said some of those claimed too little and got a check back from the government at tax time, though even more were overpaid during the year and owed money back under Obamacare.\n\nThey had to repay an average of $800.\n\nThen there were those who were overpaid by thousands of dollars. Under Obamacare, the government couldn\u2019t go after all of the money. The IRS calculated that nearly $350 million in overpayments won\u2019t be collected.\n\nAs for the 710,000 delinquents, he said they\u2019re being told to file a return within 30 days.\n\n\u201cIt is not unusual for the IRS to follow up with taxpayers for more information about their returns after April 15th,\u201d he said in his memo to Congress. \u201cThis is the first year for this new provision, and we expect that taxpayers will continue to better understand this process as it becomes more routine. We are committed to learning from this experience so that we can improve our processes and enhance the support we provide in the future.\u201d\n\nMr. Hatch, though, demanded an official audit of the agency\u2019s handling of the delinquent taxpayers.\n\n\u201cA critical element in safeguarding the integrity of insurance subsidies is the reconciliation process that occurs when taxpayers file their tax returns and reconcile subsidies received versus the amount they were in fact due,\u201d he wrote to J. Russell George, Treasury\u2019s inspector general for tax administration, in a letter demanding an investigation.\n\nHe said it\u2019s likely that some of the 710,000 delinquent filers are honest mistakes, but said many of them could be fraudulent.\n\nWith tax credits averaging $3,400, the senator calculated that the pool of people who\u2019ve ducked the tax system to date received more than $2.4 billion in total subsidies.\n\nMr. Hatch is particularly skeptical after the Government Accountability Office told his committee that undercover investigators were able to sneak 11 out of 12 fake Obamacare customers into subsidized coverage in 2014, and that all 11 were able to automatically enroll for a second year.\n\nSeto J. Bagdoyan, the GAO\u2019s director of audit services, testified the findings suggest the federal HealthCare.gov marketplace is putting access to coverage before anti-fraud measures.\n\nWhile congressional Republicans fumed, top Senate Democrats downplayed the findings, saying it didn\u2019t amount to real-world fraud. After all, the fake enrollees didn\u2019t request medical services or file their taxes.\n\nMr. Hatch said the IRS\u2018 new reporting raises concerns about whether the latter is an adequate safeguard.\n\nFor its part, the Department of Health and Human Services has said it employs various tools to verify enrollees, who sign up under penalty of perjury for lying on their applications.\n\nIt has noted, for instance, that more than 200,000 people have lost coverage because they could not prove their citizenship or legal residency.", "article_metadata": {"description": "More than 700,000 Obamacare customers claimed tax credits for buying health care but didn't bother to file their taxes, potentially jilting the government out of $2 billion in bogus payments, the Senate's senior lawmaker said Monday.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "More than 700,000 Obamacare customers claimed tax credits for buying health care but didn\u2019t bother to file their taxes, potentially jilting the government out of $2 billion in bogus payments, the Senate\u2019s senior lawmaker said Monday.", "title": "Obamacare fraudulent claims cost government $2 billion", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jul/20/obamacare-fraudulent-claims-cost-government-2-bill/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/07/20/Koskinen.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/07/20/Koskinen.jpg", "description": "More than 700,000 Obamacare customers claimed tax credits for buying health care but didn't bother to file their taxes, potentially jilting the government out of $2 billion in bogus payments, the Sena", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Obamacare fraudulent claims cost government $2 billion"}, "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Business Finance, Orrin G Hatch, Internal Revenue Service, Senate"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca9b0\"", "article_summary": "He said it\u2019s likely that some of the 710,000 delinquent filers are honest mistakes, but said many of them could be fraudulent.\nMr. Hatch said the IRS\u2018 new reporting raises concerns about whether the latter is an adequate safeguard.\nMore than 700,000 Obamacare customers claimed tax credits for buying health care but didn\u2019t bother to file their taxes, potentially jilting the government out of $2 billion in bogus payments, the Senate\u2019s senior lawmaker said Monday.\nAfter all, the fake enrollees didn\u2019t request medical services or file their taxes.\nIt has noted, for instance, that more than 200,000 people have lost coverage because they could not prove their citizenship or legal residency."}
