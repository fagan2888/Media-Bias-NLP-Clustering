A red Jeep approached heading the wrong way down a one-way portion of the alley.\n\nThe city vehicle blocked the Jeep\u2019s path, according to a police report on the incident. Eads told the driver through her open window: \u201cYou\u2019re going the wrong way on a one way.\u201d\n\nThe driver responded by stopping his vehicle and calmly walking toward Eads\u2019 open window, a full cup of a beverage in his hand. He asked what Eads said, cursed at her and threw the soda in her face, the empty cup landing inside the vehicle.\n\nThe suspect then reached through the window and punched her.\n\nAs the man walked away, Eads rolled up her window and locked her doors. He briefly returned to the code enforcement vehicle and tried to pull open the door, then fled.\n\nEads wrote down the license plate of the vehicle and later identified the suspect in a photo line-up, according to a police report.\n\nOfficers apprehended Ervin C. Allen, 21, of 3207 W. Willow Knolls Drive, Apt 63, on Wednesday morning. He was booked into the Peoria County Jail on a charge of aggravated battery but had not yet been formally charged by later in the afternoon. He could make an initial appearance before a judge to have his bond determined Thursday.\n\nAllen has one previous arrest in Peoria County for a charge of possessing 30 to 500 grams of marijuana in December 2012 and a related delivery charge. The case remains open pending completion of 24 months of probation as part of a first-time offender plea deal that could keep a felony drug conviction from appearing on his record.\n\nMatt Buedel can be reached at 686-3154 or mbuedel@pjstar.com.
