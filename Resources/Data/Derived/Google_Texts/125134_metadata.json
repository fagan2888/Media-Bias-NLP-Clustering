The certification, she said, adds another level of legitimacy to what she does.\n\nTo be eligible for the CHW certification, individuals must have at least 500 hours of paid or volunteer experience; 30 hours of training in the core competencies; and two letters of reference. They must also complete an application. Starting in 2016, applicants must also take an exam.\n\nCommunity health workers officially got a Department of Labor job code in 2010.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Community Health Worker becomes certified profession", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Orlando Sentinel", "author": "Orlando Sentinel", "og": {"site_name": "OrlandoSentinel.com", "description": "Community health workers generally work in nonprofit organizations like HHI or Federally Qualified Health Centers and they are the bridge between community itself and medical and social community.", "title": "Community Health Worker becomes certified profession", "url": "http://www.orlandosentinel.com/health/vital-signs/os-community-health-worker-new-certification-post.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-54c81745/turbine/os-community-health-worker-new-certification", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp12.17", "twitter": {"site": "@orlandosentinel", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "Community health worker, health care, HHI, uninsured", "fb": {"admins": 100004353067097, "page_id": 5779052556, "app_id": 890804050949750}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=402223551, app-argument=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/deeplinkid/82649160", "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2015-01-27", "Description": "Community health workers generally work in nonprofit organizations like HHI or Federally Qualified Health Centers and they are the bridge between community itself and medical and social community.", "y_key": "fb73650ad672fe45", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Community health worker, health care, HHI, uninsured"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd92cd\"", "article_summary": "One of them was Lolita Dash-Pitts, executive director of Front Porch Community Development Association, in St. Petersburg, who has been a community health worker since 2009.\n\"People are more apt to share their stories with somebody who's from the same community and somebody who they can relate to, and that's what's different with the community health workers,\" said Patria Alguila, co-chair of Florida Community Health Worker Coalition.\nCommunity health workers, individuals who have been linking underserved communities with medical and social services, can now be certified in Florida.\nCommunity health workers officially got a Department of Labor job code in 2010.\nCommunity health workers generally work in nonprofit organizations like HHI or Federally Qualified Health Centers and many times they're known within their community as someone who can answer questions about medical and social resources."}
