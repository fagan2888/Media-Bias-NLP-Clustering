The Democratic nominee is state Attorney General Jack Conway, who easily won the nomination over token opposition. The Republican nominee, industrialist Matt Bevin, won a hotly contested primary by an 83-vote margin, with 32.9% of the vote to Agriculture James Comer\u2019s 32.9%. Comer and former Louisville city councilman Hal Heiner, who came in third, have endorsed Bevin.\n\nThere\u2019s been some television and personal politicking, but mainly the political folks are lying low during the summer. In Kentucky, says Lowell Reese, editor and publisher of Kentucky Roll Call, \u201cthe political scene kicks off at the annual Fancy Farm picnic [on August 1] \u2026 People are on vacation now, the legislature has gone home.\u201d Then, \u201cThere\u2019s a mad rush after Labor Day.\u201d\n\nThe only post-primary poll taken so far was by Public Policy Polling (PPP) (D) in mid-June. Bevin led with 38% to 35% for Conway, with 6% for potential independent Drew Curtis. The high percentage of undecided voters \u2013 20% \u2013 reflected voter ignorance about both candidates. Conway has been the state\u2019s attorney general for nearly eight years, but a surprising 35% have no opinion of him; 34% view him unfavorably and 31% favorable.\n\nSimilarly, voters show no enthusiasm for Bevin. Some 40% have no opinion of him, despite his primary victory in May and his losing race for the US Senate last year; 31% view him favorably and 28% unfavorably.\n\nAl Cross, a political journalist with decades of experience covering Bluegrass State politics, says \u201cYou have two nominees for governor who are clearly not up to the task \u2026 Conway is not a very good politician, but he\u2019s a good public servant and imminently more qualified to be governor\u201d than Bevin. He adds that Conway \u201calways looks like he\u2019s trying to be someone he isn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nBevin, says Cross, is \u201can arrogant jerk,\u201d who easily alienates people. He won the Republican Primary \u201cbecause the two leading candidates got in a pissing contest \u2026 [Bevin] has been unable to organize the campaign within his own party.\u201d\n\nThe joker in the race is Curtis, a humorist best known for his website, www.FARK.com. He hasn\u2019t yet filed the 5,000 signatures he needs to run as an independent, but probably will. Whether he would hurt Bevin or Conway more isn\u2019t clear. But one result of his candidacy could well be that the next governor will be elected with less than a majority.\n\nConway has been on television, with a positive ad. There\u2019s also a Democratic ad on the internet that \u201cis an echo chamber of what McConnell said about Bevin last year,\u201d notes longtime Democratic consultant Dale Emmons. Bevin has not aired TV spots, but the Republican Governors Association has sponsored ads that associate Conway with coal emissions policy and Obamacare.\n\nWhile the state has been trending sharply red in recent years, local political establishments have remained blue. Reese notes that \u201c68% of the courthouse people in the 120 counties are Democrats.\u201d\n\nAlthough Republicans led in the down-ballot contests in the PPP survey, state races tend to be purple. \u201cConway watches that color,\u201d opines Reese \u201cHe\u2019s left of center, but closer to the purple than Bevin, who is red all the way through. If he continues to project himself as red, he\u2019ll lose.\u201d\n\nAnother uncertain factor is Mitch McConnell. The Senate Majority Leader easily (60% to 35%) defeated Bevin\u2019s challenge from the right in the 2014 Republican Primary, but afterwards, Bevin declined to endorse McConnell and McConnell\u2019s endorsement of Bevin in this race was particularly bloodless: \u201cI congratulate Matt Bevin on his victory and endorse him for governor.\u201d Period. End of comment.\n\nSays Reese, \u201cIf McConnell is serious about electing Bevin, it will be a big help. If he drags his feet, and his people do too, it will hurt Bevin.\u201d Adds Emmons, \u201cThe Democratic Party is united by its candidates for governor and other statewide candidates. The Republicans are still stinging from a nasty primary. Bevin hasn\u2019t reached out to all Republicans. There are still some wounds.\u201d\n\nOn issues, the expansion of Medicaid under Obamacare would be costly, and Bevin may gain on that issue. He\u2019s also taken a more conservative stance on gay marriage, advocating getting the state out of the business of issuing marriage licenses altogether, a libertarian approach supported by US Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY). Conway, while not endorsing the Court\u2019s decision, said the state \u201cmust uphold the new law and find a way to process and recognize same-sex marriage.\u201d The Democratic Party has blasted Bevin for owing property taxes on a business he owns in Maine.\n\nIn sum, \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody could say it\u2019s going one way or another right now,\u201d says Reese. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a close election,\u201d forecasts Emmons. And Cross predicts \u201ca likely low turnout with not much excitement.\u201d Stay tuned.", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2"}, "article_summary": "By Hastings Wyman \u2013The most closely watched gubernatorial race this year is in Kentucky, where the GOP is trying to win back the governor\u2019s mansion after eight years of Democratic occupancy.\nBevin has not aired TV spots, but the Republican Governors Association has sponsored ads that associate Conway with coal emissions policy and Obamacare.\nThe Democratic nominee is state Attorney General Jack Conway, who easily won the nomination over token opposition.\nThere\u2019s been some television and personal politicking, but mainly the political folks are lying low during the summer.\nBevin led with 38% to 35% for Conway, with 6% for potential independent Drew Curtis."}
