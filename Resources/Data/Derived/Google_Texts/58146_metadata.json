The expanded coverage for the poor, which is still being debated in North Carolina, would have helped the company offset reductions in Medicare payments under the law.\n\nEven without the expansion, the controversial law is making big changes, says Mission CEO Ron Paulus.\n\n\u2022 Higher quality, safer care. Mission has long had high quality standards. But it has made even more gains by reducing patient deaths by 500 a year since 2010. The law has pushed Mission to do more through cost-savings in purchasing, higher penalties for readmission from hospital-acquired illnesses and alignment with doctors under an accountable care organization. The ACO now handles Medicare spending for 40,000 people.\n\n\u2022 More cost reduction. The law created reductions in Medicare payments. Those reductions, combined with the lack of new dollars from Medicaid expansion, has forced the company to lower costs. It has negotiated lower costs across the board from blood to orthopedic implants.\n\n\u2022 Innovation. Paulus calls the current business model a \"burning platform.\" It creates the energy and sometimes fear that's needed to change, he says. Three-quarters of Mission's patient mix is on Medicaid, Medicare or considered \"no-pay,\" which is not sustainable. If the company doesn't change, it will get much smaller and won't be able to offer the services people expect, Paulus said. It is operating differently with more big growth in outpatient services, data, quality and safety.\n\n\u2022 More collaboration. One of the big changes at Mission under the Affordable Care Act is expansion of how many doctors' offices it owns. The company went through a period when it was buying rural hospitals. Today, however, it is following the revenue stream to outpatients, as the law offers more rewards for ambulatory care and savings through alignment. Mission Medical Associates has grown from 225 providers in 2012 to 345 today, the company says. Mission Health Partners, the group managing Medicare in the area as an accountable care organization, is private physician-led and growing.\n\n\u2022 More access. More people have insurance today than in years past and that has helped Mission collect more revenue. The company still provides about $130 million a year in charity care but more insurance in the market is better for patients and the company.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://avlne.ws/1CjOu5r", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "The controversial law is making big changes at Mission and for patients in Western North Carolina.", "og": {"site_name": "Citizen Times", "description": "The controversial law is making big changes at Mission and for patients in Western North Carolina.", "title": "How the Affordable Care Act changed Mission Health", "url": "http://www.citizen-times.com/story/news/local/2015/03/28/affordable-care-act-changed-mission-health/70564236/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/citizen-times.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The controversial law is making big changes at Mission and for patients in Western North Carolina.", "title": "How the Affordable Care Act changed Mission Health", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ab3d32e34c7717459a308682dd58665834c06002/c=340-0-1023-683&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/03/27/CarolinaGroup/Asheville/635630864974655411-Heartexam-001.jpg", "creator": "@asheville", "site": "@asheville", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=787264923", "fb": {"app_id": 117201858348253}, "article": {"author": "http://www.facebook.com/jonostendorff"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce16c\"", "article_summary": "One of the big changes at Mission under the Affordable Care Act is expansion of how many doctors' offices it owns.\nMission Health Partners, the group managing Medicare in the area as an accountable care organization, is private physician-led and growing.\nEven without the expansion, the controversial law is making big changes, says Mission CEO Ron Paulus.\nMission Medical Associates has grown from 225 providers in 2012 to 345 today, the company says.\nThe law has pushed Mission to do more through cost-savings in purchasing, higher penalties for readmission from hospital-acquired illnesses and alignment with doctors under an accountable care organization."}
