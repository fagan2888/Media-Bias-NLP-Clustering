Holiday shopping is in full swing, but theft is also on the rise this time of year. One crime that's proven difficult to protect against is stolen car parts. One metro man became a victim in just three hours.

Ed Murray is no stranger to News 9, but he says the unexpected happened to him while at the mall on Black Friday, and there wasn't anything he could do to stop it.

"I came out and started up my car, and it sounded like I was at the starting line of a drag race," said Murray. "It was embarrassing it was so loud."

Murray checked out his 4-runner, called a friend, and learned his catalytic converter had been stolen from underneath his car while it was parked at the mall.

"Look how easy it is, simply. You just walk up, someone's on the phone and you're on the phone distracted, and I'm touching a tail pipe right now," Murray said.

"They'll get under that vehicle with a blowtorch, and that catalytic converter will be gone in seconds," said OKC Police Lt. Jay Barnett.

Barnett said officers see it all the time: Thieves targeting car parts to sell the metal.

"Unfortunately, in the process of stealing them, the thieves invariably do a lot more damage then what they're even going to get out of it in turning around and selling it," Barnett said.

Murray said replacing the catalytic converter is going to cost him his insurance deductible, but he feels violated.

"Well, I'm worried about putting another one on there and having it happen again," said Murray. "Even a 16-year-old car with 300,000 miles on it described as white over rust can be a hit."

Murray did call police and has a report on file. Police say it's too early to tell how many car thefts like this occurred on Black Friday.
