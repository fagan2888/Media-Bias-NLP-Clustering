As President Obama led thousands of mourners in Charleston, South Carolina, in \u201cAmazing Grace,\u201d I thought about late 2013 and early 2014. Obama\u2019s Presidency was surely dwindling, if not finished. His mood was sombre, philosophical\u2014which is good if you are a philosopher; if not, not.\n\nObama described himself to me then in terms of his limits\u2014as \u201ca relay swimmer in a river full of rapids, and that river is history.\u201d More than a few columnists believed that Obama was now resigned to small victories, at best. But pause to think of what has happened, the scale of recent events.\n\nOn Thursday, the Supreme Court (despite an apocalyptic dissent about \u201cpure applesauce\u201d and \u201cinterpretive jiggery-pokery\u201d by Justice Scalia) put an end to years of court cases and congressional attacks against the Affordable Care Act, which means that millions of Americans will no longer live in a state of perpetual anxiety about health costs.\n\nOn Friday, the Supreme Court (despite a curiously ill-informed dissent about Kalahari, Aztec, and Han mating rites by Chief Justice Roberts) legalized same-sex marriage nationally\u2014a colossal (and joyous) landmark moment in the liberation of gay men and lesbians.\n\nMeanwhile, throughout the South, governors and legislatures are beginning to lower the racist banner of the Confederate flag. Cruelty on a horrific scale\u2014slaughter committed in the name of racism and its symbols\u2014has made all talk about the valuable \u201cheritage\u201d of such symbols absurd to all but a very few. The endlessly revived \u201cconversation about race\u201d shows signs of turning into something more serious\u2014a debate about institutional racism, and about inequities in the criminal-justice system, in incarceration, in employment, in education. The more Obama leads on this, the more he sheds his tendency toward caution\u2014his deep concern that he will alienate as many as he inspires\u2014the better. The eulogy in Charleston, where he spoke as freely, and as emotionally, as he ever has about race during his Presidency, is a sign, I think\u2014I hope\u2014that he is prepared, between now and his last day in office, to seize the opportunity.\n\nFinally, in recent months Obama has also, through executive action, made solid gains on immigration, wage discrimination, climate change, and foreign-policy issues, including an opening, after more than a half century of Cold War and embargo, to Cuba. These accomplishments\u2014and potential accomplishments, like a rigorous, well-regulated nuclear arrangement with Iran\u2014will help shape the coming election. In no small measure, Obama, and what he has achieved, will determine the parameters of the debate.\n\nOne can just as easily point to issues that remain of tremendous concern\u2014the consequences of painting (and revising) \u201cred lines\u201d with Syria and the early underestimation of ISIS , among others. But the idea that Obama would play out his Presidency as a professorial lame duck turns out to be without basis. And that gives a certain weight to his remarks in early 2014.\n\n\u201cI have strengths and I have weaknesses, like every President, like every person,\u201d Obama told me. \u201cI do think one of my strengths is temperament. I am comfortable with complexity, and I think I\u2019m pretty good at keeping my moral compass while recognizing that I am a product of original sin. And every morning and every night I\u2019m taking measure of my actions against the options and possibilities available to me, understanding that there are going to be mistakes that I make and my team makes and that America makes; understanding that there are going to be limits to the good we can do and the bad that we can prevent, and that there\u2019s going to be tragedy out there and, by occupying this office, I am part of that tragedy occasionally, but that, if I am doing my very best and basing my decisions on the core values and ideals that I was brought up with and that I think are pretty consistent with those of most Americans, that, at the end of the day, things will be better rather than worse.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think we are born into this world and inherit all the grudges and rivalries and hatreds and sins of the past,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut we also inherit the beauty and the joy and goodness of our forebears. And we\u2019re on this planet a pretty short time, so that we cannot remake the world entirely during this little stretch that we have. \u2026 But I think our decisions matter. And I think America was very lucky that Abraham Lincoln was President when he was President. If he hadn\u2019t been, the course of history would be very different. But I also think that, despite being the greatest President, in my mind, in our history, it took another hundred and fifty years before African-Americans had anything approaching formal equality, much less real equality. I think that doesn\u2019t diminish Lincoln\u2019s achievements, but it acknowledges that, at the end of the day, we\u2019re part of a long-running story. We just try to get our paragraph right.\u201d\n\nIt turns out that this was not, for Barack Obama, a rhetoric of resignation at all, but a kind of resolve.\n\n* An incorrect reference to the 2014 midterm elections in a previous version of this post has been corrected.", "article_metadata": {"cache-version": 20160526204643, "description": "David Remnick on the Obama Presidency following the racist killings in Charleston and the landmark Supreme Court decisions on gay marriage and Obamacare.", "account-url": "https://account.newyorker.com", "wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "og": {"site_name": "The New Yorker", "description": "In a short time, America has witnessed savage mayhem, uncommon forgiveness, furious debate, mourning, and, finally, justice and grace.", "title": "Ten Days in June - The New Yorker", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.newyorker.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Remnick-Obama-Charleston-2-1200-630-26193144.jpg", "height": 630}, "updated_time": "2015-06-28T11:27:32-04:00", "url": "http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/ten-days-in-june", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In a short time, America has witnessed savage mayhem, uncommon forgiveness, furious debate, mourning, and, finally, justice and grace.", "creator": "@newyorker", "image": "http://www.newyorker.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Remnick-Obama-Charleston-2-1200-630-26193144.jpg", "title": "Ten Days in June - The New Yorker", "site": "@newyorker", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The New Yorker", "robots": "noodp", "parsely-metadata": "{\"id\":\"3070616\",\"title_alt\":\"Ten Days in June\",\"featured_image_url\":\"http:\\/\\/www.newyorker.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2015\\/06\\/Remnick-Obama-Charleston-2-728-375-26193144.jpg\"}", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "environment": "prod", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1081530898", "fb": {"admins": 757909316}, "article": {"section": "News Desk", "tag": "Supreme Court", "published_time": "2015-06-26T20:10:48-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-28T11:27:32-04:00"}, "google-site-verification": "_jvLA9pRQom0-f6587wRKrNwfRtqyKzjfYWvwcZ5fxc", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "id": 3070616, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0", "news_keywords": "Charleston, Gay Marriage, Obamacare, President Barack Obama, Racism, Supreme Court"}, "article_summary": "What a series of days in American life, full of savage mayhem, uncommon forgiveness, resistance to forgiveness, furious debate, mourning, and, finally, justice and grace.\nAs President Obama led thousands of mourners in Charleston, South Carolina, in \u201cAmazing Grace,\u201d I thought about late 2013 and early 2014.\nI am comfortable with complexity, and I think I\u2019m pretty good at keeping my moral compass while recognizing that I am a product of original sin.\nBut the idea that Obama would play out his Presidency as a professorial lame duck turns out to be without basis.\nI think that doesn\u2019t diminish Lincoln\u2019s achievements, but it acknowledges that, at the end of the day, we\u2019re part of a long-running story."}
