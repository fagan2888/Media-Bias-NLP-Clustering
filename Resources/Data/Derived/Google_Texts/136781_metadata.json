His recent public comments have ranged from the offensive to the bizarre: from his assertion that he would have tackled the Oregon college gunman to the discovery that he once \u201cbravely redirected\u201d an armed robber he encountered in a Baltimore Popeyes. And how can we forget his infamous comments about how a Muslim shouldn\u2019t be President or how Jews could have stopped the Holocaust had they only been armed? His statements are so increasingly preposterous that it\u2019s hard to distinguish a satirical headline from a real one (like this hilarious Andy Borowitz report, \u201cBen Carson: Pompeii Victims Should Have Outrun Lava,\u201d which many on social media thought was real).\n\nIn the public consciousness, Ben Carson used to be the grape jelly to Donald Trump\u2019s chock-full-of-nutty peanut butter. He was the seemingly mild-mannered straight man to Trump\u2019s loud-mouthed crassness. Yet he\u2019s gone so far off the rails these days as to appear borderline unhinged, certainly out of touch with reality. Ben Carson is, in the words of another genius Andy Borowitz report, single-handedly shattering the stereotype that brain surgeons are smart.\n\nAs a physician trained at Johns Hopkins Medical School, I stand with my colleagues who are outraged at Carson\u2019s opinions about Obamacare \u201cas slavery\u201d, abortion \u201cas human sacrifice\u201d and prison as capable of turning \u201ca lot of straight people into gays.\u201dFrom being a well-respected neurosurgeon on faculty at Johns Hopkins Hospital, known the world over for separating multiple sets of twins joined at the head, Carson has become an embarrassment to the profession of medicine, and should be called out as such. I am dismayed that he\u2019s not been more roundly and publicly criticized by doctors across the country. He\u2019s not just making physicians look stupid, he\u2019s making us look like clueless egomaniacs. Unfortunately, the roots of his cultural tone-deafness can be easily traced to our profession. So I don\u2019t just blame Ben Carson, I blame everyone who helped Ben Carson become Ben Carson. I blame a culture of medicine that not just allows but rewards the unchecked growth of professional egos. I blame a profession that rewards doctors for thinking, and acting, like they are gods.\n\nBack in the day when I was a student and Carson was a professor at Johns Hopkins, he was the keynote speaker at my \u2018white coat ceremony\u2019 \u2014 the pomp-and circumstance-filled event in which young physicians in training are made to literally and metaphorically feel the weight of their profession upon their shoulders. \u201cYou are entering a time honored and ancient profession,\u201d someone intoned at us, while our Dean assured us that as Hopkins med students we were \u201cthe best of the best.\u201d Although the ceremony itself was intended to be a humbling experience, the culture of the institution assured that it was laced with plenty of pomposity. And in my first year of medical school, that arrogance wore the face of Dr. Ben Carson.\n\nForget the Holocaust, forget his opinions on gun control: any physician who is willing to write a memoir called Gifted Hands and speak of himself performing \u201cmiracles\u201d needs to be looked on as an out-of-touch megalomaniac. We in the medical field should have all seen this coming. Yet, back in the early 1990\u2019s, not only Ben Carson, but the rest of Johns Hopkins Medical School seemed to buy into the myth of the godly Carson \u2014 the King Solomon-like surgeon who ran around separating children like the red sea (Ok, I\u2019m mixing my Biblical metaphors, but you get where I\u2019m going.)\n\n\n\nAt my white coat ceremony, as I recall, Dr. Carson talked a lot about that near mythical separation of the conjoined twins. To his credit, he also described the challenges of being an African American neurosurgeon, relating stories about patients who mistook him for the cleaning staff. But even in those tales, the undertone of godliness was always there. Finally, Carson told a long-winded and wind-baggy story about being called away to perform emergency surgery the day of his son\u2019s fifth birthday party. That night, on returning home, having missed the cake and gifts, the balloons and singing, Carson apparently woke his small son up and told him, \u201cThis year, I didn\u2019t have time to get you a present, son, but this year, for your birthday present\u201d \u2014 and here, Carson paused for dramatic effect \u2014 \u201cI saved another child\u2019s life!\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The presidential hopeful was the keynote speaker at my white coat ceremony.
