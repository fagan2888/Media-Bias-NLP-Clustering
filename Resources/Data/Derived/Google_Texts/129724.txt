Fire officials are saying a family is lucky to have escaped a fire that tore through their home early Sunday, Feb. 7, after one of the inhabitants was awakened by loud popping sounds because the home had no smoke detectors.

A little after 5 a.m., a 71-year-old woman heard a loud popping sound three different times in her home in the 1000 block of North Perry Avenue, near West Speedway Boulevard and North Stone Avenue, according to a Tucson Fire Department media release.

She immediately got out of the house to safety and tried to put out the fire with a garden hose. The home's other resident was at work, and the pair had two dogs in the backyard. The first fire truck arrived at 5:29 a.m., and it took 10 units and 25 firefighters 48 minutes to bring the fire under control, according to the release.

No firefighters, residents or dogs were harmed, and the home's two residents will stay with relatives and get help from the American Red Cross for their other needs.

On-scene investigators could determine only that the fire began near the northwest part of the home, but they are still looking into how it started.

TFD Capt. Andrew Skaggs, a department spokesman, said more than half of residential fire deaths happen in fires that start between 11 p.m. and 7 a.m.

"Working smoke alarms save lives," he wrote in the media release. "Three of every five home fire deaths resulted from fires in homes with no smoke alarms or no working smoke alarms. You should have a smoke alarm inside and outside each bedroom and on every level of your home."
