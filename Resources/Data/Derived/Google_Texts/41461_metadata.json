And she knew they were going to be forbidding.\n\nMedical procedures like facial electrolysis cost $20,000. There was a year of therapy, required at the time to make sure Buechner, a renowned pianist, was a suitable candidate for transition \u2013 at $80 a session.\n\nSince American options were just too pricey, Buechner opted for surgery in Thailand. The tab? $10,000, including flights.\n\nThis was in the early 2000s, and none of those costs were covered by insurers. She sold one of her two pianos, a Yamaha, to help foot the bill. \u201cI emptied all my accounts,\u201d Buechner remembers. \u201cAnd I consider myself one of the lucky ones.\u201d\n\n\n\nBuechner was more than willing to pay those high bills, because it was the culmination of something she had known since childhood: She was female, despite having been born as David.\n\nTransgender issues are more openly discussed these days, such as Caitlyn Jenner\u2019s transition from Olympic athelete Bruce Jenner. But the costs of transition can be overwhelming, especially for a population that is already marginalized.\n\nThe Philadelphia Center for Transgender Surgery, for instance, lists menus of procedures for both male-to-female transitions and female-to-male that total well over $100,000.\n\nMeanwhile, corporations have been slow to help. According to the 2015 Employee Benefits Survey by the Society for Human Resource Management, just 5% of employers offer gender reassignment health care coverage to their staff.\n\nThat is up since 2011, when only 2% of companies did so. But progress has so far only been incremental.\n\nAmong larger companies, the numbers are more encouraging. One-third of Fortune 500 firms now offer healthcare coverage including transgender surgery and related medical costs, according to the Human Rights Campaign\u2019s Corporate Equality Index report.\n\nIn addition, the provisions of Obamacare \u2013 as well as state-specific laws in places like California, New York and Oregon \u2013 have been pushing plans towards transgender-inclusive health coverage, according to the National Center for Transgender Equality.\n\n\u201cThe policy environment is changing for sure,\u201d says Jody Herman, a scholar of public policy at UCLA\u2019s Williams Institute. \u201cThe way anti-discrimination laws are being interpreted is moving in the direction of saying that exclusions to trans-related healthcare are not acceptable.\u201d\n\nLost Work\n\nThe costs of transition are not just medical, though. Buechner started losing recital engagements when venues found out about her personal story. She also had trouble booking any new ones.\n\nWhen she applied to become a music teacher at more than 30 U.S. colleges, she didn\u2019t get a single response. (She is now an associate professor at Vancouver\u2019s University of British Columbia.)\n\nNo wonder so many transgender Americans are economically vulnerable. 15% report making less than $10,000 a year, according to the Center for American Progress, quadruple the average poverty rate.\n\nThe No. 1 tip from financial advisers: Start financial preparations early.\n\n\u201cPlan ahead, know what your costs are going to be, and what your insurance will cover and what it won\u2019t,\u201d says Paula Heichel, a financial adviser with Wells Fargo Advisors in Washington, D.C. who has counseled transgender referrals on their finances. \u201cThese cost are not to be taken lightly, and you have to be able to pay as you go.\u201d\n\nIndeed, with a long enough timeline, it might be worth the effort to seek employment at one of the 418 major U.S. companies which offer at least one transgender-inclusive employee health plan. Otherwise, the costs could be very significant indeed.\n\n\u201cJust imagine, you have to take every stitch of clothing you own and put it in the garbage,\u201d Buechner says. \u201cThe best analogy I tell people is, \u2018What if you moved to Bolivia tomorrow, how much would it cost to start a totally new life?'\u201d\n\n\u201cThe costs are enormous.
