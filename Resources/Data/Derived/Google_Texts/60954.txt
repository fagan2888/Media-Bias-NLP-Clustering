Jeffrey Tambor won a well-deserved Golden Globe for his groundbreaking performance as trans woman Maura Pfefferman in Amazon’s “Transparent” (which, by the way, also won the Globe for best TV series, musical or comedy. Why aren’t you watching Transparent!?)

At the end of his speech, a visibly moved Tambor dedicated his speech to the transgender community, saying: “Thank you for your courage, thank you for your inspiration, thank you for your patience and thank you for letting us be a part of the change.”
