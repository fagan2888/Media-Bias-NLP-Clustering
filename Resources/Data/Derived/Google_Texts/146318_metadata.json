He was 85.\n\nTripucka completed 10-of-15 passes in the Broncos\u2019 first game in 1960, a 13-10 victory over the Boston Patriots.\n\nBroncos general manager Bob Howsam, who later gained prominence in baseball as the architect of Cincinnati\u2019s Big Red Machine in the mid-1970s, retired Tripucka\u2019s No. 18 after the quarterback\u2019s retirement in 1963. Floyd Little (44) and John Elway (7) are the only other Broncos players whose numbers have been retired.\n\nTripucka gave his blessing to surrender his No. 18 to Peyton Manning after the Broncos signed the star quarterback before last season. The Broncos had been working in the last couple of weeks to set up a meeting between their current quarterback and original quarterback Saturday in northern New Jersey, where Tripucka lived. The Broncos are playing the New York Giants in New Jersey this Sunday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s perfectly OK for him to go ahead and use it,\u201d Tripucka said on March 14, 2012, six days before Manning signed with the Broncos. \u201cI would be honored to have him wear it. It\u2019s been retired for 50 years. That\u2019s long enough.\u201d\n\nTripucka, who was inducted into the Colorado Sports Hall of Fame in 1983, is survived by his wife Randy, six sons (including former Notre Dame and NBA basketball star Kelly) and one daughter.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Frank Tripucka, Broncos\u2019 Ring of Famer and first quarterback, dies at 85", "title": "Frank Tripucka, Broncos\u2019 Ring of Famer and first quarterback, dies at 85", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/09/12/frank-tripucka-broncos-ring-of-famer-and-first-quarterback-dies-at-85/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130912_123257_Ftripucka091213a.jpg", "height": 381}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130912_123257_Ftripucka091213a.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-12T12:39:37+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-29T11:26:58+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd65d7\"", "article_summary": "18 to Peyton Manning after the Broncos signed the star quarterback before last season.\nFrank Tripucka, the first quarterback in Broncos history, a Ring of Famer and the first player whose number was retired by the team, died Thursday morning after a lengthy illness.\n\u201cIt\u2019s perfectly OK for him to go ahead and use it,\u201d Tripucka said on March 14, 2012, six days before Manning signed with the Broncos.\nTripucka completed 10-of-15 passes in the Broncos\u2019 first game in 1960, a 13-10 victory over the Boston Patriots.\nThe Broncos had been working in the last couple of weeks to set up a meeting between their current quarterback and original quarterback Saturday in northern New Jersey, where Tripucka lived."}
