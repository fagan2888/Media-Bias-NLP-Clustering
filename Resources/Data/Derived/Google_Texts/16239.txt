(Newser) – Ten reports of full or partial fingertip amputations and one finger laceration have prompted the voluntary recall of 5 million strollers manufactured by Graco Children's Products, CNN reports. The Graco- and Century-branded models have folding hinges that "can pinch a child’s finger, posing a laceration or amputation hazard," reports the US Consumer Product Safety Commission, which also warns those watching children to show "extreme care when unfolding the stroller to be certain that the hinges are firmly locked before placing a child in the stroller." A free repair kit with hinge covers will be offered for affected models, which were sold through Target, Toys R Us, Walmart, Amazon, and other retail and online sites, according to Graco.

Recalled models include Aspen, Breeze, Capri, Cirrus, Glider, Kite, LiteRider, Sierra, Solara, Sterling, and TravelMate model strollers and travel systems, with a manufacture date of Aug. 1, 2000, to Sept. 25, 2014. Even such a big recall might not take babies out of harm's way, though. An investigation set to air on ABC's 20/20 tonight shows that most recalled products are never brought in or fixed—at best, the number hovers around 20%, at worst 5%, ABC News reports. Instead, the products stay in use or—worse—are listed for resale, which is illegal, according to the CPSC. ABC News found plenty of such resale items available and points out that manufacturers don't have federal minimums to meet in terms of either effort or money when it comes to recalls.
