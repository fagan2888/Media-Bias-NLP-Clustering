On a daily basis, my primary focus is on your South Jersey 7-day forecast. That’s my comfort zone, and also where I find the highest degree of accuracy forecast-wise. Obviously, if you go out farther ahead, the forecast confidence decreases. But occasionally, I like to test the waters of longer range forecasting, and try to pick out general trends. While meteorology is an inexact science, strides have been made in seasonal forecasts. So let’s start with the next seven days, and branch out from there.
