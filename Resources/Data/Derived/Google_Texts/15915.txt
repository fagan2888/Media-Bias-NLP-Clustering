Two suspects have been arrested in connection with a 7-Eleven robbery in Loveland, officials said.

Tips received from the public allowed the Loveland Police Department to arrest 20-year-old Adam Wells-Soto and a 17-year-old boy on Thursday in connection with a robbery earlier this week, according to a Loveland Police Department news release.

Wells-Soto was taken to the Larimer County Jail where he is being held on suspicion of aggravated robbery and theft, the release said.

The boy was taken to juvenile holding on suspicion of robbery and theft.

Police are continuing to look for a third person they believe was involved in the robbery who acted as a driver.

“We have no reason to believe at this time that the three people mentioned above were involved in the other two recent robberies in Loveland,” police said.
