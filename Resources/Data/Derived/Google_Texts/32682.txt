Depending upon one’s politics, the surcharge a small number of restaurants has begun adding to the food and beverage totals of their guests could cause indigestion.



Even though the amounts are small, at least for now, for some it is the principle of the thing. They are against Obamacare, and they don’t want to be forced to pay for the law when they go out to eat.

Well, better start scrutinizing the fine print of those restaurant receipts. Already, some eateries in Florida and California are tacking on what amounts to Obamacare surcharges to customer's checks.



A local sports bar chain in Florida made national news for its Obamacare surcharge tucked into its guest checks under the heading “ACA Surcharge” – as in Affordable Care Act.

Gator’s Dockside, a chain of self-described “family-friendly, sports-themed restaurants” in Florida, slapped a surcharge on customers that works out to about 1% of the total bill, according to Forbes.com.



A photo of one receipt posted on the web shows a subtotal of $21.15 with applicable sales tax of $1.49 and ACA surcharge of $.20.

Not enough to give one heartburn, you say?

Well consider this: The portion of Obamacare that is leading to the so-called surcharge hasn’t even taken effect yet. This is the employer mandate, under which employers with 50 or more full-time employees must offer healthcare, and it takes effect in 2015. So it’s possible these surcharges could grow in size and spread to more and more eating establishments.

So what do you think of the so-called Obamacare surcharge showing up on restaurant bills of a few eating establishments across the country?

Would it give you indigestion to pay for Obamacare as part of your meal?

Or would you consider the small charge a minor incidental to a great lunch or dinner?
