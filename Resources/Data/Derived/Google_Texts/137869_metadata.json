At the time of his death, an appeal was pending before the United States Supreme Court asking the justices to halt his execution. Andrew Cohen lays out the timeline:\n\nAt 10:11, the final lethal injection protocols were initiated. By this time, the 8th Circuit had rejected all of the claims before it\u2014over another pointed dissent from Judge Bye\u2014leaving only an active appeal before the Supreme Court. At 10:20 Smulls was pronounced dead. Ten minutes later, at 10:30, the Supreme Court notified the lawyers that Smulls\u2019 final stay request had been denied at 10:24. This means that Missouri began to execute a man 13 minutes before it was entirely sure it could do so. Smulls was pronounced dead four minutes before the Supreme Court finally authorized Missouri to kill him.\n\nAs Cohen notes, \u201c[j]ust imagine what we\u2019d be talking about today if the justices had granted Smulls\u2019 stay request four minutes after he was pronounced dead.\u201d At the very least, Smulls\u2019 appeal held enough merit that a United States Court of Appeals judge would have granted the stay.\n\nAnd yet, thanks to a 1983 Supreme Court ruling, Missouri\u2019s actions were probably legal. The state points to Barefoot v. Estelle, which explained that \u201c[s]tays of execution are not automatic pending the filing and consideration of a petition for a writ of certiorari from this Court to the court of appeals that has denied a writ of habeas corpus,\u201d to justify its actions in the Smulls case.\n\nSmulls died amidst a cloud of uncertainty regarding exactly how Missouri planned to execute him and whether those protocols were even legal. In an earlier iteration of his appeals, a divided United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit held that the state was not required to disclose the manufacturer of the drugs used in its execution protocol \u2014 information that Smulls\u2019 lawyers wanted so that they could determine the quality of the drugs being used (and, by extension, whether they were likely to cause Smulls an undue amount of pain).", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Herbert Smulls was in the middle of a phone call discussing his attorneys' final efforts to save his life when he was reportedly seized by prison guards, hauled into an execution chamber, and injected with a toxic cocktail of drugs.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Herbert Smulls was in the middle of a phone call discussing his attorneys' final efforts to save his life when he was reportedly seized by prison guards, hauled into an execution chamber, and injected with a toxic cocktail of drugs.", "title": "Missouri Executes Man While His Appeal Was Still Pending Before Supreme Court", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2014/02/02/3237571/missouri-executes-man-appeal-pending-supreme-court/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/smulls.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Herbert Smulls was in the middle of a phone call discussing his attorneys' final efforts to save his life when he was reportedly seized by prison guards, hauled into an execution chamber, and injected with a toxic cocktail of drugs.", "creator": "@imillhiser", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/smulls-321x214.jpg", "title": "Missouri Executes Man While His Appeal Was Still Pending Before Supreme Court", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-justice", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/smulls.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/smulls.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-02T09:00:54+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/IanMillhiserPublic"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "At the time of his death, an appeal was pending before the United States Supreme Court asking the justices to halt his execution.\nAnd yet, thanks to a 1983 Supreme Court ruling, Missouri\u2019s actions were probably legal.\nSmulls was pronounced dead four minutes before the Supreme Court finally authorized Missouri to kill him.\nBy this time, the 8th Circuit had rejected all of the claims before it\u2014over another pointed dissent from Judge Bye\u2014leaving only an active appeal before the Supreme Court.\nTen minutes later, at 10:30, the Supreme Court notified the lawyers that Smulls\u2019 final stay request had been denied at 10:24."}
