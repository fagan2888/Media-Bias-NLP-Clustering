Three of four are unhappy with the direction the country is headed. Two of three think America is in a state of decline, and more than half believe that we\u2019re no longer a country where anyone can get ahead and have a better standard of living.\n\nThis dismal outlook includes every major American institution. Strikingly, the one that enjoys the greatest public support is the military \u2013 but even at that, only four of ten adults have \u201ca great deal of confidence\u201d in our military. Next highest are churches, but only one of four has a high level of trust in our religious institutions. Only one in five has the highest degree of confidence in the presidency; one of seven in public schools; one of eight in the U.S. Supreme Court; one of ten in banks; and only one out of twenty in Congress.\n\nOver the last generation, we\u2019ve largely destroyed our uniquely American culture, created an activist government that pursues its own agenda, no longer serving the people or following the Constitution, banished organized religion to a place of public irrelevance, and reconstructed the traditional family into something never before known in the history of mankind.\n\nExacerbating these problems is the paralysis that citizens feel as a result of our 24/7/365 national news inundation. We routinely hear of maddening decisions by the U. S. Supreme Court, the president\u2019s use of his phone and pen to enact unpopular policies and the Senate\u2019s refusal to take up over 300 common sense bills passed by the House (more than 200 of them passed unanimously), and we know there is nothing we can do to reverse any of these things.\n\nIn tough and frustrating times, there is a tendency to look outside for help \u2013 for something to relieve the pressure, to solve the problem, or simply to give hope. For those in the religious community, the pressure-relief valve is often eschatology (the theological view of the final events of history, commonly described as the \u201cend times\u201d) They tell themselves that what is going on now is what was prophesied millennia ago \u2013 that current events were decreed by God and are beyond any human control.\n\nBut is America\u2019s fate really predetermined? Is a solution beyond our reach? I firmly believe the answer is no \u2013 which is why George Barna and I wrote the book U-Turn: Restoring America to the Strength of its Roots. There are things that we can do that will make a difference.\n\nSome simple facts from the American Revolution provide encouragement here. When we read of the Revolution today, knowing that we won the struggle against Great Britain, we assume that there was widespread public support for independence and liberty. Not so.\n\nHistorians report that only one-third of Americans supported independence; one-fourth opposed it; and the remaining group didn\u2019t care who won; they just wanted to be on the winning side. Only 9 percent of Americans actually participated in securing liberty for the nation. Clearly, then, it doesn\u2019t take a definitive majority to win; it only takes a dedicated and persistent core.\n\nAnother lesson from the American Revolution is seen in its early battles. When British troops approached Lexington, Concord, Bunker Hill, Williamsburg, and elsewhere, Americans didn\u2019t send a messenger to George Washington to ask what should be done. Instead, they simply stood up in their own local community to face down the enemy closest to them.\n\nWe, too, need to pay attention to what is happening locally. We need to fill our school boards, city councils, public utility districts and other city and county positions with common-sense, God-fearing, Constitution-heeding individuals. There are millions of such persons in America; and while it might be difficult to elect them to the U.S. Senate or House right now, it\u2019s not difficult to elect them as mayors or school board presidents.\n\nAnd for those in the faith community, our destiny is still in our hands. Most credible prophecy experts agree that America doesn\u2019t appear in end-time prophecies. The fates of nations such as Gog, Magog, Israel, Egypt and others may be, but America\u2019s is not. We still get to choose our destiny. So, Americans of faith shouldn\u2019t use eschatology as an excuse to retreat into a shell of non-activity, but instead should obey Jesus\u2019 direct command to His servants to \u201cOccupy until I come\u201d (Luke 19:13). We must adopt the attitude voiced in 2 Kings 7:3, when a handful of individuals looked at what was going wrong around them and asked the simple question, \u201cWhy should we just sit here, waiting to die?\u201d They got moving and their seemingly inconsequential actions brought profound results.\n\nThis is not the time to back out of the battle. Instead, it is the time to go forward.\n\nIt\u2019s time for us to restore America to the strength of its roots.\n\nDavid Barton is a historian, author, and the Founder and President of WallBuilders - a national pro-family organization that presents America\u2019s forgotten history and heroes.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Lessons from the American Revolution show that our destiny is still in our hands.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Lessons from the American Revolution show that our destiny is still in our hands.", "title": "DAVID BARTON: How America can reclaim greatness", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jan/26/david-barton-how-america-can-reclaim-greatness/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/05/04/3ce17d5c78ea3511530f6a7067000aac.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/05/04/3ce17d5c78ea3511530f6a7067000aac.jpg", "description": "Lessons from the American Revolution show that our destiny is still in our hands.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "DAVID BARTON: How America can reclaim greatness"}, "Author": "David Barton", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdad19\"", "article_summary": "David Barton is a historian, author, and the Founder and President of WallBuilders - a national pro-family organization that presents America\u2019s forgotten history and heroes.\nAnother lesson from the American Revolution is seen in its early battles.\nSome simple facts from the American Revolution provide encouragement here.\nANALYSIS/OPINION:It\u2019s difficult to get Americans to agree on many things today, but there are a few exceptions.\nNext highest are churches, but only one of four has a high level of trust in our religious institutions."}
