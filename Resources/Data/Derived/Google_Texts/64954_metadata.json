We think the wellness atrium is a unique feature.\u201d\n\nGuests can see miles of the Rocky Mountains through towering windows. The interior view includes demonstration kitchens offering healthy-cooking classes, an eatery, gift shop, drop-in day care, pharmacy and other retail-like elements.\n\nFocus groups said they wanted \u201ccalm, peaceful, serene,\u201d Jenkins said. Much of the hospital is situated away from the large Level III trauma center with 24/7 emergency services.\n\nThe 50-acre campus has miles of marked walking trails, a chapel, an assortment of water features and gardens. Much of the acreage will be held as vacant land awaiting future development.\n\nCentura Health\u2019s new hospital advertises \u201cno waiting,\u201d unlimited visiting hours, competitive outpatient pricing, conveniently located rooms and private discharge exit with valet service. Health workers will have a gym.\n\nOf the 92 inpatient beds, 60 are concentrated \u2014 and tucked out of view \u2014 on the fourth floor. All the essential hospital services are in the 350,000-square-foot building \u2014 imaging, doctor offices, surgery center, 20-bed intensive care unit, 12 birthing rooms, labs and so on. They just aren\u2019t what most people will see, unless they need to be in one of them.\n\nFlood damage to the first floor in September 2013 from 12 inches of rain set back the opening of the new health campus from late 2014 to a newly scheduled March date. Crews had to replace almost half the concrete on the first floor. Repairing the damage cost $6.6 million and three months of lost work, Centura spokeswoman Christy Maraone said.\n\nThe old St. Anthony North, off Federal Boulevard and 84th Avenue in Westminster, will be repurposed, Jenkins said, as a long-term care and rehab services facility with a free-standing emergency department, primary care and behavioral health services.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re not going to do is abandon the population we\u2019re already serving,\u201d Jenkins said.\n\nCentura Health also plans to open three outpatient care neighborhood centers in October \u2014 in Dacono at I-25 and Summit Boulevard, in Thornton at 128th Avenue and Colorado Boulevard, and at Church Ranch Boulevard.\n\nSt. Anthony Hospital with a Level I trauma center is at West Second Place and Routt Street in Lakewood.\n\nElecta Draper: 303-954-1276, edraper@denverpost.com or twitter.com/electadraper", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Westminster\u2019s St. Anthony North Health Campus design a shift in focus", "title": "Westminster\u2019s St. Anthony North Health Campus design a shift in focus", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/07/27/westminsters-st-anthony-north-health-campus-design-a-shift-in-focus/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140727__20140728_A4_CD24STANTHONY2p1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140727__20140728_A4_CD24STANTHONY2p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-27T21:09:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T11:05:34+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fceb6f\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIt\u2019s a paradigm shift,\u201d said Kevin Jenkins, a St. Anthony North vice president.\nSt. Anthony Hospital with a Level I trauma center is at West Second Place and Routt Street in Lakewood.\nWESTMINSTER \u2014 It might be a hospital, but the design of the new $177 million St. Anthony North Health Campus is meant to make guests forget about sickness when it opens in early 2015.\nThe old St. Anthony North, off Federal Boulevard and 84th Avenue in Westminster, will be repurposed, Jenkins said, as a long-term care and rehab services facility with a free-standing emergency department, primary care and behavioral health services.\nFlood damage to the first floor in September 2013 from 12 inches of rain set back the opening of the new health campus from late 2014 to a newly scheduled March date."}
