Asked how that differed from efforts last century to track Jews in Nazi Germany, he said: \u201cYou tell me.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, Trump deflected criticism of the remarks, saying in a tweet: \u201cI didn\u2019t suggest a database-a reporter did. We must defeat Islamic terrorism & have surveillance, including a watch list, to protect America.\u201d\n\nHis comments came amid renewed security concerns following the Islamic State attacks in Paris last week that killed at least 129 people, and a political fight over U.S. plans to take in 10,000 refugees from Syria.\n\nREAD: Anti-immigrant rhetoric can be deadly (COMMENTARY)\n\nTwo Republican presidential rivals, former Florida Governor Jeb Bush and Ohio Governor John Kasich, were the most critical of the database comments. Bush called them \u201cjust wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s manipulating people\u2019s angst and their fears,\u201d he said on CNBC. \u201cThat\u2019s not strength. That\u2019s weakness.\u201d\n\nKasich, whose Super PAC is launching a $2.5 million series of attacks against Trump, said the remarks proved the real estate mogul was not worthy of the White House.\n\n\u201cThe idea that someone would have to register with the federal government because of their religion strikes against all that we have believed in our nation\u2019s history,\u201d Kasich said in a statement.\n\nTexas Senator Ted Cruz, campaigning in Iowa, said he was glad Trump was running because he had generated a lot of excitement for the Republican race, but criticized his support for registries.\n\n\u201cOn the question of should the federal government keep a registry of any religious group? The answer is of course not. The First Amendment protects religious liberties for every American,\u201d Cruz said.\n\nRetired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, who earlier this week compared Syrian refugees to \u201crabid dogs,\u201d called singling out an individual religion to create a database \u201ca pretty dangerous precedent.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea to treat anybody differently, one of the hallmarks of America is that we treat everybody the same,\u201d Carson said.\n\nHe said, however, it would be acceptable to shut down mosques where \u201ca lot of activity going on that is radicalizing people.\u201d\n\nREAD: Ben Carson: Muslims unfit to be US president\n\nOther Republican candidates opted not to weigh in on the remarks from Trump, who earlier in the week called for shutting down American mosques frequented by radicals.\n\nTrump, who leads the Republican presidential field in opinion polls, has called for deporting the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants in America.\n\nHe said Muslims would be legally required to register for the database. \u201cThere should be a lot of systems, beyond databases,\u201d he said.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders also criticized Trump\u2019s comments.\n\n\u201cThis is shocking rhetoric. It should be denounced by all seeking to lead this country,\u201d Clinton said on Twitter. Sanders called Trump\u2019s remarks \u201coutrageous and bigoted.\u201d\n\nThe Paris attacks have launched a growing debate on the 2016 campaign trail about the appropriate U.S. response.\n\nAs the debate over terrorism has gained prominence, polls show Republicans turning to Trump, a billionaire with no previous government experience, to tackle the issue. A Reuters/Ipsos poll after the attack found 33 percent of Republicans think he is best suited to address terrorism, leading the field.\n\nTrump supporters Betty and Terry Phelps, of Lisco, Nebraska, said the database made sense. Betty Phelps said it would not be much different than existing databases.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all kept track of, through driver\u2019s license, social security number,\u201d she said.\n\nIbrahim Hooper, spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, a Muslim rights group, said other Republican candidates should say whether they would close mosques, create a database of Muslims or require Muslims to carry a special ID card.\n\n\u201cThis is way beyond the pale, this is basically a call to persecute a religious minority based on nothing other than their faith,\u201d Hooper said.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Beliefs, 2016 election, Ben Carson, Donald Trump, Islam, Jeb Bush, John Kasich, mosque, Muslims", "generator": "Easy Digital Downloads v2.5.16", "og": {"site_name": "Religion News Service", "description": "GOP rivals Gov.
