And that\u2019s my charm. Never a dull moment.\n\nPeople would be surprised to know that \u2026\n\nI don\u2019t drink alcohol.\n\nWhat is your drink of choice?\n\nWater.\n\nWhere is your happy place?\n\nChinatown. Many ancient Chinese secrets here.\n\nWhat is your biggest regret?\n\nNone. I can sleep at night knowing I\u2019ve always done the right thing.\n\nIf you could change one thing about yourself, what would it be?\n\nLose 100 lbs.\n\nWhat do you consider your greatest achievement?\n\nWriting for Philly.com. Ever since I was a child, I had an infatuation with the Inquirer and the Daily News. Then I was a reader, and now I\u2019m a columnist. It\u2019s my dream come true!\n\nWhich trait do you most value in another person?\n\nEthical behavior trumps everything else.\n\nIf you could interview anyone, past or present, who would it be?\n\nYou! If you have an unheard but interesting story to tell that will appeal to Philly.com readers, I want to hear from you!\n\nFavorite movie?\n\nPlanet of the Apes. The ending still gives me the chills.\n\nWhat TV show is currently your DVR/On Demand obsession?\n\nYou\u2019ll be surprised to know I don\u2019t have TV service.\n\nWhat is your guilty pleasure?\n\nPleasure? Try pleasures! Life is too short not to enjoy what you want when you want it.\n\nThe worst thing anyone said or did to you is\u2026\n\nI\u2019m a gentleman, and so I\u2019ll let an ex off the hook!\n\nI believe in\u2026\n\nPeanut butter. Do you believe in Peter Pan?\n\nIf you could travel back in time, where would you go?\n\nSeptember 10, 2001 and be a hero.\n\nWhat is your motto or inspiration?\n\nI\u2019m used to overcoming tremendous odds. At age 7, I was thrown from a horse and almost died. As a consequence, I was unable to breathe through my mouth or nose. For 13 years, I had a tracheotomy. Every specialist told me I\u2019d never be able to breathe normally again. I never accepted that sentence. I finally found an otorhinolaryngologist who cured me. What I learned was to never, ever give up. And that\u2019s been my guiding principle throughout life.", "article_metadata": {"pubdate": 20160526, "editdate": "20141006T12:21:06", "twitter": {"title": "Featherman: Teachers' union should strike", "url": "http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/U-TURN/Teachers-union-should-strike.html", "image": "http://media.philly.com/images/20141007_rrxschools_haver_1024.jpg", "creator": "@JohnFeatherman", "site": "@phillydotcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "cg": "news", "keywords": "Local Republican activist, mayoral race, teacher strike, Mayor, Kenneth A.
