OK, so she didn't win. Miranda Levy still did what all of the finalists on "Project Runway" do. She returned to her hometown to create a new line of designs.

Levy will unveil her latest fashions for the first time since appearing on last year's season of "Project Runway" in her "Return to the Runway" show at 6 p.m. Friday at the Intercontinental Milwaukee, 139 E. Kilbourn Ave.

She'll be joined by fellow "Project Runway" designers Christopher Straub (Season 6), Peach Carr (Season 8) and Angela Bacskocky (Season 12) as well as other Milwaukee designers: Gretchen Bartz, Linda Breshears Marcus, Amanda Martinez, Tama Roberts and Sara Terrell.

Tickets are $15 to $50 online at miranda2014.evenbrite.com. Seating is limited.
