A man has been charged with murder in connection with a fatal hit-and-run crash in the Portland neighborhood early Sunday, according to Louisville Metro Police.

Charles Ballard, 26, is charged in the death of Cory Russell Starrett, 24, who was hit about 3:44 a.m. on Griffiths Avenue at 25th Street, said Alicia Smiley, a spokeswoman for the police department.

The driver was going fast, and “it appeared that he struck an object, causing it to go airborne,” Smiley said. A witness realized that "it was actually a person that he had struck.”

Starrett, who was in his early to mid-20s, was pronounced dead at the scene, Smiley said. Police located Ballard nearby at 25th and Bank streets.

Ballard was charged with murder and driving under the influence, Smiley said. He also was charged with leaving the scene of an accident and having no insurance or operator’s license with him.

Funeral arrangements for Starrett are pending, according to the Coroner's Office.
