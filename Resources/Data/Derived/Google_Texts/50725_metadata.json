The flames damaged a barn and siding on two houses.\n\nFirefighters initially had trouble reaching the fire and lining up water, Greeley Fire Marshal Dale Lyman said.\n\n\u201cFor a minute, it looked like we might be losing the battle. Thank goodness we were able to get water on those buildings,\u201d he said.\n\nThe cause was uncertain; investigators were looking at whether perhaps an unpermitted fire played a role, he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a strong possibility.\u201d\n\nEast of Denver along Interstate 70, a brushfire south of Bennett burned about 100 acres. It damaged a guest house and two sheds and destroyed a dozen vehicles, including motorcycles and ATVs, officials said. Two firefighters were hurt slightly responding to that fire, which was contained.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re putting out hot spots,\u201d Arapahoe County Sheriff\u2019s Office spokeswoman Julie Brooks said.\n\nIn Larimer County, the Poudre Fire Authority and the Wellington Fire Department extinguished a grassfire, according to the Larimer County Sheriff\u2019s Office. And firefighters in eastern El Paso County snuffed a 5-acre blaze at Hanover.\n\nThe National Weather Service had issued a \u201cred flag\u201d warning due to temperatures around 87 degrees and wind gusting to 35 miles per hour in the Denver area. \u201cWe\u2019re not sure what ignited those fires, but with the dry grass, it didn\u2019t take long to take off. Those grasses are very dry,\u201d meteorologist Frank Cooper said.\n\nThe warning will be lifted as temperatures dip into the 70s on Monday, Cooper said. \u201cBut it\u2019s still going to be dry.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Heat and wind drive Front Range wildfires including one in Greeley", "title": "Heat and wind drive Front Range wildfires including one in Greeley", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/10/11/heat-and-wind-drive-front-range-wildfires-including-one-in-greeley/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151011__IMG_5074ap1.jpg", "height": 490}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151011__IMG_5074ap1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-11T12:44:59+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T05:59:27+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Wildfires"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9936\"", "article_summary": "In Larimer County, the Poudre Fire Authority and the Wellington Fire Department extinguished a grassfire, according to the Larimer County Sheriff\u2019s Office.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not sure what ignited those fires, but with the dry grass, it didn\u2019t take long to take off.\nWind-whipped wildfires devoured dry grass along the Front Range on Sunday, destroying vehicles, sweeping toward homes and occupying firefighters from Larimer to El Paso counties.\n\u201cThey\u2019re putting out hot spots,\u201d Arapahoe County Sheriff\u2019s Office spokeswoman Julie Brooks said.\nGreeley firefighters battled a blaze on the east side of the city that accelerated in grass and spread quickly, igniting woodpiles."}
