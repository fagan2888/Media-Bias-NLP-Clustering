Jerry Brown (D) what may seem like an unusual request. They want to spend more money on the state\u2019s Medicaid program that provides insurance services to low-income Californians.\n\nSpecifically, lawmakers want to pour $200 million into the state\u2019s struggling Denti-Cal program, the state-run dental insurance program under Medicaid. The lawmakers were spurred to action by a damning report published in April. \u201c[The] report reveals that \u2018California\u2019s Medicaid dental program is\u2026 broken, bureaucratically rigid, and unable to deliver the quality of dental care most other Californians enjoy,\u2019\u201d the lawmakers wrote in a letter to the governor.\n\n\u201cFixing Denti-Cal is a priority for legislative Republicans,\u201d they concluded.\n\nAt first glance, the California GOP\u2019s enthusiasm to boost Medicaid funding seems out of character. Republicans are usually vocal opponents of expanding Medicaid with government dollars, citing the program\u2019s runaway costs. Nineteen states still refuse to expand Medicaid coverage under Obamacare \u2014 almost all Republican controlled.\n\nBut California Republicans are perhaps not so different from conservative legislators in other states. Earlier this year, the same Missouri lawmakers who dug in their heels against Medicaid expansion extended dental benefits to nearly 300,000 Medicaid recipients. In 2014, Republican-controlled South Carolina did the same, using federal Medicaid dollars to cover 70 percent of the cost.\n\nIf people can\u2019t get in with prevention, they eventually show up for more serious treatments.\n\nIn fact, many of the states opposed to Medicaid expansion \u2014 including Wyoming, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, and North Carolina \u2014 provide at least very basic dental benefits to their low-income residents. The Medicaid program does not require dental coverage, so these benefits are entirely optional.\n\nThese lawmakers view preventive dental care as a cost-saving measure. Missouri estimates that emergency dental room visits cost the state $17.5 million in 2013. Nationwide, dental emergency room visits cost an estimated two billion dollars per year, according to the American Dental Association.\n\n\u201cReceiving regular preventive care from dentists is the most effective way to avoid [expensive emergency room] visits for dental problems,\u201d Missouri health officials said of fiscally conservative lawmakers\u2019 decision to expand government health insurance.\n\nIn California, lawmakers are relying on the same logic.\n\n\u201cIf people can\u2019t get in with prevention, they eventually show up for more serious treatments,\u201d California Sen. Dr. Richard Pan (D), a dentist himself, told a state oversight agency. \u201cNow you have cavities that aren\u2019t treated and you\u2019re putting in a crown. Then they set up in the emergency room with an abscess and now you\u2019re treating that. Then they have to have teeth extracted and then you\u2019re talking about dentures and on and on. You start to cause this ball to roll.\u201d\n\nCalifornia is doing a poor job of stopping the ball. Denti-Cal\u2019s woes are much the same as those of Medicaid nationwide: reimbursements are so low that doctors don\u2019t want to participate in the program, leaving needy people without timely or accessible care. Of the 15 states that offer extensive dental coverage for low income adults, California is perhaps the most penny-pinching \u2014 paying dentists 35 percent of what other state-run dental programs pay their dentists, on average.\n\nDentists also complained to the state oversight agency that it takes months to register using the program\u2019s offline, 40-page application. Worse, once they do register they have to deal with the program\u2019s sensitive billing system.\n\n\u201c[Even] with experienced staff, the return rate on claims was 25 percent because maybe you left a box out, or didn\u2019t process a fee somewhere, or didn\u2019t have the exact word for the description for why you were treating that specific tooth,\u201d Assemblymember Jim Wood, a former practicing dentist, told the state oversight agency.\n\nMany dentists simply don\u2019t want to deal with the program. 400,000 Californians live in counties that have no Denti-Cal providers at all or no dentists willing to accept new Denti-Cal patients. Consequently, just 38 percent of Denti-Cal-eligible children see a dentist annually.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, did not ultimately include adult dental coverage in Medicaid reform. Dental care was left largely untouched by the reforms, leaving state lawmakers to reform dental care for themselves.\n\nOne reform that has bipartisan support is for states to license mid-level dental hygienists to do teeth cleanings without a dentist\u2019s permission. Most states require that dental hygienists be employed by dentists, which drives up the cost of tooth cleanings and prevents low income individuals from getting regular cleanings. Democratic lawmakers tried and failed to fold this reform into Obamacare in 2010. The conservative organization Americans for Tax Reform, headed by Grover Norqhuist, endorsed this reform as a tax-free alternative to Medicaid.\n\nBut Republicans in California see Medicaid as a solution, and they are working to improve its cost-effectiveness. Gov. Brown is expected to release his revised budget later today.\n\nCory Herro is an intern at ThinkProgress.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "At least, on a specific type of program.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "At least, on a specific type of program.", "title": "Why Some Republicans Actually Want To Expand Medicaid", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2016/05/13/3778194/medicaid-dental-republicans/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/13104548/AP_557123640896-600x315.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "At least, on a specific type of program.", "title": "Why Some Republicans Actually Want To Expand Medicaid", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/13104548/AP_557123640896-321x214.jpg", "creator": "@coryherro14", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/13104548/AP_557123640896-540x303.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/13104548/AP_557123640896-99x66.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2016-05-13T13:26:32+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Health Why Some Republicans Actually Want To Expand Medicaid CREDIT: Branden Camp/AP ImagesThis month, California\u2019s top Republican lawmakers asked Gov.\nThey want to spend more money on the state\u2019s Medicaid program that provides insurance services to low-income Californians.\nDental care was left largely untouched by the reforms, leaving state lawmakers to reform dental care for themselves.\nBut Republicans in California see Medicaid as a solution, and they are working to improve its cost-effectiveness.\nSpecifically, lawmakers want to pour $200 million into the state\u2019s struggling Denti-Cal program, the state-run dental insurance program under Medicaid."}
