Good news: the website behind the campaign, DoYouGotInsurance.com, is back and this time, they're targeting the ladies.\n\nWhere to begin?\n\nIf the genders in this ad were reversed, it would be slammed by critics as promoting \"rape culture\" and misogyny. Instead, we're supposed to applaud \"Susie\" for making a good health choice using the free birth control pills provided by the Affordable Care Act. This is insane. This ad is disrespectful to both men and women, trivializes sexuality, and is in no way an appropriate advertisement.\n\nAnd for heaven's sake, the grammatically correct word is \"have,\" not \"got.\" Susie has insurance. This is despicable.\n\nThanks Obamacare!", "article_metadata": {"description": "Let's call it \"hosurance.\" .05/24/2016 5:51:47AM EST.", "author": "Christine Rousselle", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Let's call it \"hosurance.\"", "title": "Christine Rousselle - From the Makers of Brosurance: New Ad Encourages Casual Sex", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/christinerousselle/2013/11/12/from-the-makers-of-brosurance-new-ad-encourages-casual-sex-n1745206", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2013/11/12/13.png", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Let's call it \"hosurance.\"", "title": "Christine Rousselle - From the Makers of Brosurance: New Ad Encourages Casual Sex", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/christinerousselle/2013/11/12/from-the-makers-of-brosurance-new-ad-encourages-casual-sex-n1745206", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2013/11/12/13.png", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "From the Makers of Brosurance: New Ad Encourages Casual Sex, Christine Rousselle, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1a9f\"", "article_summary": "This ad is disrespectful to both men and women, trivializes sexuality, and is in no way an appropriate advertisement.\nIf the genders in this ad were reversed, it would be slammed by critics as promoting \"rape culture\" and misogyny.\nGood news: the website behind the campaign, DoYouGotInsurance.com, is back and this time, they're targeting the ladies.\nInstead, we're supposed to applaud \"Susie\" for making a good health choice using the free birth control pills provided by the Affordable Care Act.\nAnd for heaven's sake, the grammatically correct word is \"have,\" not \"got.\""}
