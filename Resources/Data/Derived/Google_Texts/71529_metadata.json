But most wells here haven\u2019t been tested for contaminants. Among those that have, one in 10 has elevated levels of arsenic, state toxicologist Andrew Smith told me last June.\n\nHow likely is your well to contain arsenic? The state has updated its searchable public health data portal, so now you can see the latest contamination counts by town. I\u2019ve listed them by the percent of wells exceeding the maximum level of arsenic the state deems safe to drink: 10 micrograms per liter (ug/L).\n\nThe information reflects only well water tests conducted by the state-run Maine Health and Environmental Testing Laboratory \u2014 results from commercial water testing companies are unavailable \u2014 but it provides a useful snapshot. Arsenic and other drinking water contaminants often cluster in certain areas depending on the underlying geology.\n\nYou can see that clustering effect here. Thanks to my colleague Darren Fishell for creating this map.\n\nDrinking water with high levels of arsenic can lead to skin damage, circulation problems, stomach pain, nausea, and tingling in the hands and feet. Over many years, it may raise the risk of developing cancer, including skin, bladder, and lung cancers, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Arsenic exposure can also lead to low birth weight and affect brain development in young children.\n\nOf course, the best way to know if your well water is contaminated is to have it tested.\n\nRecommend this article", "article_metadata": {"wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "fb": {"app_id": 748756371893770}, "viewport": "width=device-width", "generator": "WordPress 4.1.5"}, "article_summary": "Among those that have, one in 10 has elevated levels of arsenic, state toxicologist Andrew Smith told me last June.\nThe information reflects only well water tests conducted by the state-run Maine Health and Environmental Testing Laboratory \u2014 results from commercial water testing companies are unavailable \u2014 but it provides a useful snapshot.\nI\u2019ve listed them by the percent of wells exceeding the maximum level of arsenic the state deems safe to drink: 10 micrograms per liter (ug/L).\nDrinking water with high levels of arsenic can lead to skin damage, circulation problems, stomach pain, nausea, and tingling in the hands and feet.\nAbout half all all Maine households rely on private well water, one of the highest rates in the country."}
