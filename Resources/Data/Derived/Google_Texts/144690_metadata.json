Customers need to upload their proof of legal residence to HealthCare.gov by Sept. 5, or the administration will kick them out of their health care plan at the end of the month.\n\nAs of Tuesday, HHS says that it\u2019s still sending final notices out to 239,000 of the 300,000, meaning by far most customers with problems still haven\u2019t been able to resolve them, The Associated Press reports.\n\nPart of the problem could be HealthCare.gov. Insurance agents and immigration experts have reported that their customers are struggling to upload the necessary documents to HealthCare.gov at all. (RELATED: Report: HealthCare.gov Still Doesn\u2019t Work)\n\nSome immigration advocates say that many of the notices may be ignored because customers don\u2019t understand the importance or think they\u2019ve already taken care of the problem. They\u2019ve also hit the Obama administration for sending out notices in only two languages, English and Spanish.\n\n\u201cPeople do not know what they say or that they\u2019re important. Many have been putting them aside or throwing them away,\u201d Philadelphia immigration advocate Amy Jones told The AP.\n\nFlorida has the largest number of customers with immigration problems at almost 100,000, but some working in the area believe the Obama administration\u2019s letters are being ignored.\n\nVicki Tucci, a Palm Beach attorney, told The Associated Press that while she worked with thousands of Obamacare sign-ups during open enrollment, less than 20 clients have come back with questions about the notices. Tucci noted that some customers thought the letter was a scam and didn\u2019t take any action. And among the clients that Tucci has helped, many have already sent in their documentation and it seemingly hasn\u2019t been recorded.\n\nIf customers can\u2019t find a way to submit their proof of citizenship or immigration status by Friday, they\u2019ll lose their coverage. And not only are customers at risk for losing their health insurance, any who received premium subsidies may be required to pay back the federal government if their documentation is never received.\n\nCustomers who submit their documentation by the Friday deadline, but have not had it processed by federal officials, will remain covered as the Obama administration works its way through the backlog, according to The AP.\n\nThe administration has struggled to address millions of inconsistencies in Obamacare applications. The belated attempt to check citizenship and immigration status could cause the Obamacare enrollment tally to drop significantly.\n\nFollow Sarah on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Sarah Hurtubise", "description": "Many still slated to lose coverage", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "The Obama administration is days away from rescinding Obamacare coverage from hundreds of thousands of customers, as the vast majority of those with applications problems still haven't cleared them up", "title": "Days Before Deadline, Almost 240,000 Still Haven\u2019t Fixed Immigration Status For Obamacare", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/09/02/days-before-deadline-almost-240000-still-havent-fixed-immigration-status-for-obamacare/", "image": {"width": 1185, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/RTR3IXIX-1-630x4441-e1453761615395.jpg", "height": 552}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Many still slated to lose coverage", "title": "Days Before Deadline, Almost 240,000 Still Haven\u2019t Fixed Immigration Status For Obamacare Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/09/02/days-before-deadline-almost-240000-still-havent-fixed-immigration-status-for-obamacare/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/RTR3IXIX-1-630x4441-e1453761615395.jpg"}, "creator": "@@SarahMHurtubise", "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-09-02 18:39:04", "sailthru.title": "Days Before Deadline, Almost 240,000 Still Haven't Fixed Immigration Status For Obamacare", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "sailthru.tags": "obamacare,sarah-hurtubise", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "keywords": "obamacare", "sailthru.description": "The Obama administration is days away from rescinding Obamacare coverage from hundreds of thousands of customers, as the vast majority of those with applications problems still haven't cleared them up", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/RTR3IXIX-1-630x4441-e1453761615395.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "The belated attempt to check citizenship and immigration status could cause the Obamacare enrollment tally to drop significantly.\nIf customers can\u2019t find a way to submit their proof of citizenship or immigration status by Friday, they\u2019ll lose their coverage.\n4305638The Obama administration is days away from rescinding Obamacare coverage from hundreds of thousands of customers, as the vast majority of those with applications problems still haven\u2019t cleared them up.\nThey\u2019ve also hit the Obama administration for sending out notices in only two languages, English and Spanish.\nInsurance agents and immigration experts have reported that their customers are struggling to upload the necessary documents to HealthCare.gov at all."}
