Runners race with chips on their shoes that track progress at 2K, 5,200 meters, 8K and then the finish at 10K, which offers insight into how the race played out.\n\nAt 2K, Colorado was third with 181 points behind Iona (143 points) and Syracuse (97 points). Colorado remained in third at 5.2K with 130 points, behind Stanford\u2019s 123 and Syracuse\u2019s 90. At 8K, Colorado and Syracuse were tied with 99 points. By the finish, Syracuse had won 82-91 over Colorado.\n\nSenior Pierce Murphy, Colorado\u2019s No. 1 runner all season, was in 18th at 2K before moving up 11 spots to seventh, then three spots by 8K and one final position to third in the last 2K.\n\nLet\u2019s took a closer look at Colorado\u2019s next five runners.\n\nSenior Morgan Pearson\n\nPearson was 28th at 2K, 18th at 5.2K (10-spot improvement), 16th at 8K (+2) and 25th at the finish \u2014 a drop of nine spots in the last 2,000 meters and an overall gain of three spots.\n\nPearson was 28th at 2K, 18th at 5.2K (10-spot improvement), 16th at 8K (+2) and 25th at the finish \u2014 a drop of nine spots in the last 2,000 meters and an overall gain of three spots. Freshman John Dressel\n\n94th at 2K, 76th at 5.2K (+18), 41st at 8K (+35), and 26th (+15) at the finish \u2014 a net gain of 68 spots from 2K to the finish. That kind of movement suggests Dressel started too slowly and didn\u2019t have the time to move up farther. Still, that\u2019s not surprising given that he was racing only his second 10K ever (his last one eight days prior at regionals in Albuquerque).\n\n94th at 2K, 76th at 5.2K (+18), 41st at 8K (+35), and 26th (+15) at the finish \u2014 a net gain of 68 spots from 2K to the finish.

Junior Ben Saarel\n\n96th at 2K, 78th at 5.2K (+18), 50th at 8K (+28), 31st at the finish (+19). Net gain of 65 spots.\n\n96th at 2K, 78th at 5.2K (+18), 50th at 8K (+28), 31st at the finish (+19). Net gain of 65 spots. Senior Connor Winter\n\n64th at 2K, 35th at 5.2K (+29), 27th at 8K (+8), 33rd at the finish \u2014 a drop of six spots in the last 2K and a net gain of 31 positions.\n\n64th at 2K, 35th at 5.2K (+29), 27th at 8K (+8), 33rd at the finish \u2014 a drop of six spots in the last 2K and a net gain of 31 positions. Senior Ammar Moussa\n\n42nd at 2K, 26th at 5.2K (+16), 35th (-9), 42nd (-7) at the finish. No net change in position.\n\nMoussa, because he was sixth, didn\u2019t count in team scoring. But he fell behind Syracuse\u2019s eventual No. 4 \u2014 Philo Germano \u2014 in the final few meters of the race (based on some video I saw; more on that below).\n\nMoussa was fifth overall at nationals last year, and Saarel \u2014 who said he had been struggling to come back from mononucleosis all year \u2014 was seventh. So two Buffs runners who were huge contributors last year had way worse days on Saturday. Colorado won the championship in 2014 with 65 points.\n\nNow let\u2019s examine Syracuse, which placed three runners in the top 10 and started much stronger overall near the front of the race and then gained positions. Even though Colorado\u2019s fifth runner came in before Syracuse\u2019s fourth and fifth, Syracuse\u2019s front-loaded group made the task of winning extremely difficult for Colorado.\n\nSophomore Justyn Knight\n\nKnight, Syracuse\u2019s top runner, moved up front early in the race and never wavered. He was 4th at 2K, 3rd at 5.2K, 3rd at 8K, and 4th at the finish \u2014 no net change in position.\n\nKnight, Syracuse\u2019s top runner, moved up front early in the race and never wavered. He was 4th at 2K, 3rd at 5.2K, 3rd at 8K, and 4th at the finish \u2014 no net change in position. Sophomore Colin Bennie\n\n13th at 2K, 8th at 5.2K (+6), 7th at 8K (+1), 8th at the finish (-1). Net gain of five spots.\n\n13th at 2K, 8th at 5.2K (+6), 7th at 8K (+1), 8th at the finish (-1). Net gain of five spots. Senior Martin Hehir\n\n14th at 2K, 13th at 5.2K (+1), 9th at 8K (+4), 9th at the finish (0). Net gain of five positions.\n\n14th at 2K, 13th at 5.2K (+1), 9th at 8K (+4), 9th at the finish (0). Net gain of five positions. Junior Joel Hubbard\n\n50th at 2K, 41st at 5.2K (+9), 51st at 8K (-10), 47th at the finish (+4). Net gain of three positions. Hubbard ended as Syracuse\u2019s fifth runner.\n\n50th at 2K, 41st at 5.2K (+9), 51st at 8K (-10), 47th at the finish (+4). Net gain of three positions. Hubbard ended as Syracuse\u2019s fifth runner. Senior Dan Lennon\n\n51st at 2K, 44th at 5.2K (+7), 56th at 8K (-12), 65th at the finish (-9). Net loss of 14 positions. Lennon ended as Syracuse\u2019s No. 6.\n\n51st at 2K, 44th at 5.2K (+7), 56th at 8K (-12), 65th at the finish (-9). Net loss of 14 positions. Lennon ended as Syracuse\u2019s No. 6. Sophomore Philo Germano\n\nHere\u2019s where it gets interesting. Germano was 52nd at 2K, 56th at 5.2K (-4), 53rd at 8K (+3), 39th at the finish (+14). That\u2019s a net gain of 13 positions from 2K to the finish, but he gained 14 spots in the final 2,000 meters \u2014 which translated to 13 positions in team scoring. In photos I took of the race from the platform, you can see him charging hard \u2014 he\u2019s behind Moussa in one frame, and then ahead of him in the next. All other things being equal, without Germano\u2019s late surge to be Syracuse\u2019s No. 4 runner, the Orange doesn\u2019t win.\n\nSyracuse maintained a strong group of three near the front of the race and either maintained or moved up a handful of positions. Yes, cross country is a team sport, and Syracuse\u2019s success with its top three set it up for victory. But Germano\u2019s monster last 2,000 meters \u2014 and, really, what I suspect was an all-out kick in the homestretch \u2014 ultimately sealed the win for the Orange.\n\nDaniel Petty: dpetty@denverpost.com or @danielpetty", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Ammar Moussa,Ben Saarel,Colin Bennie,Colorado,Connor Winter,Dan Lennon,Joel Hubbard,John Dressel,Justyn Knight,Martin Hehir,Morgan Pearson,Pierce Murphy,Syracuse", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "The Field House", "description": "A look at the numbers and positioning that led Syracuse to upset Colorado at the NCAA cross country championships on Saturday in Louisville, Ky.", "title": "How Colorado lost to Syracuse at NCAA cross country championships", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/colleges/2015/11/22/how-colorado-lost-syracuse-ncaa-cross-country/34571/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/colleges/files/2015/11/philo-germano-syracuse-495x329.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "A look at the numbers and positioning that led Syracuse to upset Colorado at the NCAA cross country championships on Saturday in Louisville, Ky.", "title": "How Colorado lost to Syracuse at NCAA cross country championships", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/colleges/2015/11/22/how-colorado-lost-syracuse-ncaa-cross-country/34571/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/colleges/files/2015/11/philo-germano-syracuse-495x329.jpg", "creator": "@danielpetty", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "A look at the numbers and positioning that led Syracuse to upset Colorado at the NCAA cross country championships on Saturday in Louisville, Ky."}, "article_summary": "\u201cTom\u201d Sawyer Park at the NCAA cross country championships, they tried to do the same, but the story of how they lost happened in the final 2,000 meters.\nYes, cross country is a team sport, and Syracuse\u2019s success with its top three set it up for victory.\nNet gain of 65 spots.\nNet gain of five spots.\nNet gain of five positions."}
