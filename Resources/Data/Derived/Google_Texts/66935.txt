HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) - A look at where Pennsylvania’s four Democratic candidates for U.S. Senate - John Fetterman, Katie McGinty, Joe Sestak and Joe Vodvarka - stand on a selection of issues, from abortion to transportation. The primary election is Tuesday.

___

ABORTION

Fetterman, McGinty and Sestak support abortion rights, and would oppose legislation to ban most abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy. Vodvarka opposes abortion rights.

___

DEFICIT/DEBT

To close the nation’s deficit and lower the national debt, Fetterman said he supports closing the carried interest loophole, which allows hedge fund managers “to get away with paying one of the lowest tax rates.” He said he also supports ensuring that millionaires pay no less than 30 percent of their income in taxes, ending inversions and offshore subsidiaries and legalizing and taxing marijuana.

McGinty said she supports closing corporate tax loopholes that encourage companies to “ship jobs overseas.”

Sestak said he would support closing “many corporate tax credits, deductions and loopholes that allow corporations to pay an effective tax rate of somewhere between 13 and 17 percent.” That includes ending “inversions” to take advantage of tax laws in low-tax countries, instituting a hybrid tax holiday in which companies with money overseas are taxed 10 percent for bringing their profits back onshore, with an option to keep half of it to invest in either workforce training or domestic capital projects.

Vodvarka said he would impose tariffs on certain foreign imports and impose a 15 percent tax on the profits U.S. companies overseas.

___

ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENT

Fetterman, McGinty and Sestak support President Barack Obama’s administration’s new carbon pollution regulations on power plants, called the “Clean Power Plan,” and its agreement to a United Nations accord on global warming in which countries pledge to limit the amount of greenhouse gases emitted by human activity in the coming decades.

Vodvarka opposes both.

___

FINANCIAL REGULATIONS

Fetterman, McGinty and Sestak said they support the Dodd-Frank Act of 2011, a new post-recession regulatory scheme for banks.

Fetterman and Sestak said they support the reinstatement of the Glass-Steagall Act, a Depression-era law that once separated commercial and investment banking. It was repealed in 1999. McGinty did not say whether she would support its reinstatement or not.

Vodvarka said he was unfamiliar with both laws.

___

GAY RIGHTS

All four support same-sex marriage and civil protection for lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transgender people.

___

GUN RIGHTS

Fetterman, McGinty and Sestak would support requiring background checks for online gun sales and purchases at gun shows; a ban on the manufacture and sale of automatic firearms: a ban on allowing people on the terrorist watch list to obtain a firearm; increasing federal criminal penalties against people who make “straw purchases”; expanding gun-buying prohibitions to abusive dating partners and convicted stalkers; imposing a federal limit on magazine capacity; allowing federal funding for gun violence prevention research; granting broader authority to the federal government to release firearm trace data; requiring gun dealers to submit their inventories to law enforcement agencies; and repealing a federal law that shields gun manufacturers from liability in cases where their weapons are used in crimes.

McGinty also would support a ban on the sale of armor-piercing “cop killer” bullets.

Fetterman, McGinty and Sestak oppose federal reciprocity legislation to require every state to recognize and allow the use of concealed carry licenses or permits issued by other states.

Vodvarka opposes additional gun control measures.

___

HEALTH CARE

Fetterman, McGinty and Sestak support Obama’s 2010 federal health care law, the Affordable Care Act, and Sestak voted for it as a member of the U.S. House. All three also voiced support for “single payer” health care that excludes private health insurance companies. Fetterman said single payer health care “is the ideal that we should all move towards.” McGinty said single payer health care “would squeeze so much of the excessive costs out of our health care system.” Sestak said he supports the “public option” concept that did not make it into the final version of the Affordable Care Act.

Vodvarka said he believes marketplace coverage under the Affordable Care Act will collapse and that measures need to be taken to improve competition among health insurers to cover more people.

___

IMMIGRATION

Fetterman, McGinty and Sestak support the “DREAM Act,” which would establish a path toward citizenship for people who came to the United States illegally as children and who attend college or join the military; a 2012 Obama administration policy of allowing young people in the country illegally who have no criminal history and graduated from high school or served in the military to remain in the county; a bipartisan immigration reform bill that passed the Senate in 2013 that would establish a path toward citizenship for an estimated 11 million immigrants living illegally in the United States; and Obama’s executive order in 2014 to allow up to 5 million immigrants living in the U.S. illegally - mainly the parents of U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents - to work legally in the United States.

Vodvarka said he supports a national referendum on policies that would allow immigrants living in the U.S illegally to stay.

___

LABOR UNIONS

All four said they support the right to organize and collectively bargain and would oppose efforts to ban unions from collecting “fair share” fees from nonmembers.

___

MARIJUANA

Fetterman said he supports the full legalization of marijuana. McGinty, Sestak and Vodvarka said they support the legalization of medical marijuana and the decriminalization of small amounts of marijuana possession.

Vodvarka said he would support a national referendum on whether to legalize marijuana.

___

MIDDLE EAST

All four oppose the use of ground troops in Syria.

Fetterman, McGinty and Sestak support the Obama administration’s nuclear accord with Iran.

Vodvarka opposes the nuclear accord with Iran.

___

MINIMUM WAGE

All four support an increase in the federal minimum wage, currently set at $7.25 an hour. Fetterman and McGinty support an increase to $15 an hour. Sestak said he supports an increase to $10.80 an hour. Vodvarka supports an increase to around $10 an hour.

___

POLICE

Fetterman and Sestak said they support President Obama’s order last year ending long-running federal transfers of some combat-style gear to local law enforcement agencies.

McGinty did not say whether she supports it.

Vodvarka said he would support a referendum on whether to end the transfers.

___

PRESIDENTIAL RACE

Fetterman has endorsed Bernie Sanders in the Democratic Party’s presidential nominating contest. McGinty has endorsed Hillary Clinton. Sestak and Vodvarka are not endorsing a candidate.

___

SOCIAL SECURITY

All four oppose the diversion of Social Security payroll taxes into privately managed investment accounts. All four said they oppose cutting Social Security benefits or raising the retirement age. Fetterman, McGinty and Sestak support raising the income limit for Social Security payroll taxes, currently $118,500. Vodvarka said he would not raise the income limit.

Sestak said he supports the creation of a new “Consumer Price Index for Elderly Consumer” to ensure year-to-year benefit increases more closely match rising costs for seniors.

___

TRADE

All four oppose the Trans-Pacific Partnership free trade agreement with 11 Pacific Rim nations that Obama’s U.S. trade representative signed in February and that is awaiting congressional approval. However, Sestak said he believes the trade agreement can be renegotiated to be acceptable - such by as protecting intellectual property - and that it a strong agreement is important to domestic job creation and blunting Chinese economic influence over Asian nations.

___

TRANSPORTATION

Fetterman said he supports Obama’s proposal to impose a $10 fee per-barrel of oil to help fund investments in clean transportation that fight climate change and he would support an increase in the 18.4 cent per-gallon federal gas tax to keep the Highway Trust Fund solvent, primarily to fix the most desperate repairs.

McGinty said she would seek to raise the money through closing corporate tax loopholes.

Sestak said he would end state and federal subsidies to the oil, gas, and coal industry to subsidize clean and renewable energy sources. For highways, he said he would support reducing or eliminating the gasoline tax in favor of a “fair use-based formula” to improve Highway Trust Fund solvency and create a national transportation infrastructure bank.

Vodvarka said he would support imposing tariffs on some foreign imports.
