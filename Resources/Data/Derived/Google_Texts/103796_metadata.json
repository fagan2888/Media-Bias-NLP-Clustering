Advances in technology have broadened our sense of community. This growing interconnectivity creates complex relationships that are explored in the field of sociology. By better understanding how society functions, sociology professionals can help find practical solutions to meet the needs of communities.\n\nYou\u2019ll develop a better understanding of the world around you when you pursue an online sociology degree at Southern New Hampshire University \u2013 and develop the skills and knowledge you\u2019ll need to create a fulfilling career in this complex field.\n\nWhat Is Sociology?\n\nSociology is the study of society, which is specifically accomplished through the examination of the social lives of individuals, groups and civilization as a whole. By unifying elements of economics, psychology, history and other pertinent areas of study, sociology holds up a lens to our world.\n\nCarolyn Paul, a lead sociology faculty member at SNHU, is intimately familiar with the field. She believes that the emphasis on group interactions, both large and small, is what sets sociology apart from similar disciplines that also study human behavior.\n\n\"In sociology we talk about micro groups like the family. We look at continuing trends like changing gender roles in the family,\" Paul said. \"Then we look at large groups like social institutions. We identify clear social problems that plague a nation.\"\n\nIs Sociology Right for You?\n\nWhen it comes to studying humans, you have a number of fields to choose from. In addition to sociology, the student interested in human behavior or societal interactions could pursue degrees in areas of study such as anthropology, psychology, history or even criminology, to name a few. Each has a unique emphasis that sets it apart from the rest. The first step is to figure out exactly what area you're most interested in, and then determine which field focuses the most on that area.\n\n\"The student who's interested in people will wonder, 'Where should I go?'\" Paul said. \"They need to decide what they're interested in studying and start asking 'How do I prepare for a career working with people?'\"\n\nAccording to Michelle Alvarez, associate dean of social sciences for SNHU College of Online and Continuing Education, those who are interested in people in general often opt for anthropology, which is broadly defined as the study of humankind. Students who are interested in providing human services, such as mental health resources, tend to study psychology. Those who are more interested in the group dynamics of human society should consider pursuing a career in sociology.\n\n\"It's really the study of group behavior. How do groups function?\" Alvarez said. \"I think that's what sets it apart.\"\n\nIf you're interested in pursuing a career in which you work toward understanding group behavior, an online bachelor's degree in sociology could be the next step in preparing you for the job market.\n\nCareer Opportunities in Sociology\n\nWhen it comes to a choosing a career in this area of study, you have many options to consider. Sociology is a field that offers career opportunities that are as diverse as the people who study the topic. For example, those who fill the position of a sociologist study society and societal behavior through the examination of groups, social institutions and processes, often at a research institution or university \u2013 but that's far from the only job opportunity available to those who study the field.\n\n\"There are a lot of paths that students take,\" Paul said. \"Some go on from a bachelor's to a master's in social work. I'm finding that more students are working in the nonprofit sector. Many students are interested in helping the homeless in their community. If you're interested in people and issues like poverty, sociology is where you should look.\"\n\nMany people with backgrounds in sociology choose positions where they can actively help members of their community through work in the nonprofit sector. Some enter into social services or advocacy work. Others choose careers as varied as college admissions, criminal justice, urban planning and health policy.\n\nSome even go into marketing after studying sociology, Paul said. By combining their educational background with the tools provided by the field of marketing, graduates are able to promote community organizations and help raise awareness for important issues on local, national and sometimes even global levels.\n\nProjected Salary and Field Growth\n\nWhen you pursue a degree in sociology, you'll have a number of options to choose from in an up and coming field. For example, social and community service managers are in growing demand across the country. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reported that there were 132,900 people working in these jobs in 2012, a number that is expected to increase by 21 percent by 2022. The mean salary for service managers in this field is about $60,000 a year.\n\nAnother 61,410 members of the U.S. workforce were employed as of May 2014 as social workers. While the position can encompass a number of different areas, and generally requires a graduate degree, the mean yearly salary for these positions is $58,410.\n\nYou could also play a role in improving your community. Demand for recreation workers, for example, is on the rise, according to the BLS. With a degree, you could play a leadership role in developing or running social programs like these in your area.\n\nWhatever career you choose to pursue, a sociology degree will widen your opportunities and open doors for advancement in this growing field.\n\nThe Benefits of a Sociology Degree\n\nWhile some pursue a career in the field without a sociology degree, a formal education is becoming increasingly important for success. By earning a bachelor\u2019s degree in sociology, you\u2019ll acquire the knowledge and skill set to pursue a particular area that you're most interested in, opening doors when it comes to career opportunities.\n\nA degree also gives students opportunities to start building up a portfolio for future job applications. For example, Paul said that in her Sociology of the Family course, students are required to pick a trend to study and create a long-form magazine style article on the topic. Once the articles are completed, she encourages students to use them to start building up a portfolio to share with prospective employers in the future. By earning a degree in sociology, you not only gain knowledge in your area of study, you also have the chance to showcase your abilities through hands-on assignments that will help prepare you for employment in the field.\n\nAn SNHU Online Sociology Degree\n\nAn online sociology degree from SNHU allows students to pursue their interest in sociology no matter where they are on their academic journey. Whether you're looking to earn your bachelor's degree in sociology right out of high school or are working full time in a different field and are ready for a career change, the flexibility of the online program lets you advance your career while maintaining your activities outside of your academic commitments.\n\nStudents actively engage in their education through online discussion boards, community posts and other resources no matter where they\u2019re at geographically. Paul said that she often interacts more with her online students than those that she teaches at a physical location.\n\n\"I know my online students better,\" Paul said. \"You can have a campus class where some students talk and some don't, but in online programs everyone participates.\"\n\nPart of the increased engagement results from the fact that students are able to interact with others at any time of the day or night. If a student is thinking about a topic the day after the discussion, he can go back and post on the discussion board even though the discussion may have already formally ended. It's a luxury that isn't afforded to students sitting in on campus lectures, where participation is limited to the time period of the class.\n\n\"The ability to interact is endless, and some students may post multiple times,\" Alvarez said.\n\nTo ensure the most proactive education possible, every course has been designed with the help of one or two industry experts who bring hands-on field experience to the table. As a result, students garner academic knowledge and real-world insight to effectively enter the workforce after graduation. An SNHU degree is more than something that you can hang on your wall. It's tailored to prepare you for your future career in the field that you choose to study.\n\n\"Course development is a science and an art,\" said Alvarez. \"I think we do a good job of developing courses that are creative and innovative and bring real-world experience to students in the course.\"\n\nConcentration in Community Health\n\nAt SNHU, students who are interested in issues related to community health can now earn a bachelor's degree in sociology with a concentration in community health. It\u2019s perfect for those who want to work with local organizations to help address health-related concerns in their community. In this concentration, students examine current trends in health and health policy and examine the consequences that the issues have on individuals, groups and society as a whole.\n\nPublic health is an up-and-coming field that students should seriously consider if they're looking for a career that affords opportunities to help make a difference in their community, as positions are on the rise. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, jobs for health educators and community health workers are expected to grow by 21 percent by 2022.\n\nIn the online bachelor's degree in sociology program at SNHU, the community health concentration includes four classes that focus on the intersection between sociology and the medical field, preparing students for work in the community.\n\n\"Whatever sociology program they pursue, they're able to tag on the concentration in public health courses that give them specifics about helping in communities,\u201d said Paul.\n\nIn this area of study, many job seekers who are interested in sociology and healthcare are finding employment opportunities related to the Affordable Care Act (ACA), Paul said. Because the legislation is so intricate and lengthy, many people find it difficult to determine what they qualify for and how to go about getting their benefits. Those with a bachelor's degree in sociology are good candidates for a growing number of community positions for trained individuals who can articulate the ACA and explain eligibility rules to help promote better healthcare in populations.\n\nThe Life of an Online Sociology Student\n\nOne of the benefits of an online degree program is that you can fit the coursework around your existing schedule. Whether you have familial responsibilities, a full-time job or an active military assignment, you can find ways to prioritize your academic success without sacrificing other important areas of your life.\n\nDuring the week, you'll study and learn just like students who are taking classes at a physical location, but instead of sitting in a classroom, you'll be working from a computer at the location of your choice. That means if you have to work a morning shift, for example, you can take care of your course work in the evening. You can structure your schedule in the way that best fits your unique needs.\n\nPart of a student's week may also be dedicated to an internship in the field. At SNHU, the hands-on experience that an internship offers is seen as a critical part of the degree program that prepares students for their future career.\n\n\"A clear advantage to our SNHU program is that we're virtual in our learning, but we're hands-on in our programs,\" Paul said. \"Those can open doors. I've had students finish internships and then have employers ask for their resume.\"\n\nStudents can seek out opportunities for volunteer or paid internships in their community, and then present their proposed internship to the staff at SNHU. Faculty will vet the opportunity to ensure that it meets educational requirements and will help prepare the student for opportunities outside of academics. If the standards are satisfied by the opportunity, Alvarez will sign off on the internship and the student can start working with the organization.\n\nIn addition to important hands-on experience, Alvarez added that these internships give students an opportunity to start networking in the field before they even graduate with their sociology degree. Even if a student isn't offered a position with the organization they worked with, they build important connections that may be helpful in their job search down the road.\n\nThe SNHU Difference\n\nAt SNHU, you'll receive an education that goes above and beyond simple coursework when pursuing your sociology degree. From the moment you express interest in the sociology program, you'll have access to advisors who will answer your questions and help plan the best schedule to fit with your busy life. That assistance doesn't stop when your schedule is set. Academic program and career advisors will help you every step of the way.\n\nAdvisors aren't the only ones who will assist you on your path to success. SNHU instructors are chosen with very high standards to ensure that students receive the best possible education. You'll be in courses taught by experts in the field, who are dedicated to seeing you succeed. While you may be taking the course remotely, your instructors are available via phone or email, or on your course discussion board, to answer questions or to help you better understand challenging material.\n\n\"We have excellent faculty,\" Alvarez said. \"They're very responsive to students who need support. Here, there are high expectations, so you really have to be a good instructor who brings authentic field experience to the classroom.\"\n\nHigh-quality instruction is supplemented with resources that help you get the most out of each course. You\u2019ll have access to the Shapiro Library, which provides students with remote access to over 100 databases that include journals, reports, magazines and newspapers specifically chosen to support curriculum. Students can also live chat with a librarian or call directly on the phone during business hours.\n\n\"As an instructor I've had the opportunity to teach at a few other schools and SNHU courses are loaded with resources to help our students be successful,\" Paul said.\n\nAcross the board, you\u2019ll have the support you need to succeed as you advance your education in pursuit of a fulfilling career.\n\nContinued Success with Some Help from SNHU\n\nMany new doors will open with the completion of your degree.
