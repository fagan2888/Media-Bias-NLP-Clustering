Well, your wish is granted.\u201d\n\nWell, not really. In October, the Associated Press reported that $184 million of \u201cno-bid\u201d contracts were given to firms with professional connections to Peter Lee, executive director of Covered California. This April, investigative journalist Sharyl Attkisson reported the story of whistleblower Peter Hill, a former project manager at the exchange\u2019s call center. After complaining to the board about waste and cover-ups, Hill\u2019s contract was terminated.\n\nEmails between Hill and Covered California colleagues are inexplicable. He was told not to use his government email to search for information on \u201cbest practices,\u201d and not leave an electronic trail of draft contract language or clarifications.\n\nCovered California\u2019s customer service is appalling: On Yelp, it had 205 reviews on April 27, of which 185 were one star out of a possible five \u2013 the lowest ranking possible. When tax season rolled around, 100,000 Covered California customers got either inaccurate tax forms or none at all. This is important because Obamacare through the IRS levies a tax penalty on people who do not have government-qualified coverage.\n\nLee is a veteran executive of the Pacific Business Group on Health, a nonprofit coalition of large employers (including Bechtel, Boeing and Safeway) that operated a previous health insurance exchange established by the state. PacAdvantage was created to give small businesses the same leverage as big employers in negotiating health benefits. PBGH took it over in 1999 and shut it down with minimal warning in 2006 because insurers fled and the exchange was losing money. Remarkably, under Lee\u2019s leadership, Covered California gave PBGH two contracts worth $525,000.\n\nIt is not hard to understand why it took so long for the problems to surface at Covered California. First, the billion dollars that the exchange burnt through were federal grants. Nobody at the state level really cared to be accountable. Second, nine in 10 of Covered California\u2019s enrollees are paying artificially low premiums because of tax credits paid to insurers in the exchange. These people have no choice but to put up with poor customer service because they cannot get covered outside Covered California.\n\nFortunately, Covered California\u2019s enrollment has peaked at about 1.4 million people, effectively unchanged from 2014. However, about a thousand people enroll every day because of events (such as job loss or marriage) that qualify them for Obamacare. And there will be another surge of about half a million people when 2016 open season starts Oct. 15. (There is a lot of \u201cchurn\u201d in Covered California. Almost one third of 2014 enrollees did not sign up for 2015. A similar number of new enrollees signed up.)\n\nEvery Californian should be concerned, because federal funding is finished. Although Covered California\u2019s budget \u201cassumes\u201d $360 million is left for 2015, there will be no more funding after that. The exchange\u2019s operating budget of almost a half million dollars will have to be financed by a fee of $13.95 added to each enrollee\u2019s premium each month. Any bets on when Covered California\u2019s board might have to go to the Legislature for more money?\n\nHere\u2019s the good news: None of this is necessary. The government has no more business running a health insurance exchange than the DMV does running a car dealership. Brokers and agents, either in person or online, are perfectly competent to inform people about their choices and help them make the right one. Indeed, two California businesses, eHealthinsurance.com and GetInsured.com both had a national online presence years before Obamacare and state exchanges interfered with their markets.\n\nEven Obamacare\u2019s strongest opponents agree that individuals should receive a tax break for buying individual health insurance. Obamacare forces us to use unnecessary government-run exchanges to get it. Partisans on both sides of the Obamacare debate should agree that shutting down Covered California deserves to be a priority for both Congress and the state Legislature.\n\nJohn R.
