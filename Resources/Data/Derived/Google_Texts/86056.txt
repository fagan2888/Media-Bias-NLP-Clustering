MetroHealth to re-open former HealthSpan buildings over the next two weeks

The MetroHealth System says it will begin serving patients in several former HealthSpan buildings in the Cleveland area over the next two weeks.

Medical buildings in Parma, Cleveland Heights and Bedford were opened to patients on Tuesday. A facility in Rocky River facility will start serving patients on April 18, and a new medical office will open at the Galleria YMCA in August to serve the downtown population.

HealthSpan announced plans last December to close its medical group and exit the Northeast Ohio market as a direct provider of health services. The company, which has suffered steep financial losses in recent years, has also said it will wind down its insurance business and cease operations in January 2017.

HealthSpan has struck a deal to transition many of its members to Medical Mutual in coming months, although it remains unclear how many will do so.

Meanwhile, MetroHealth, University Hospitals and Cleveland Clinic have been hiring the company's physicians. MetroHealth said it has hired over 60 former HealthSpan doctors and brought an additional 25 providers into the area to care for the more than 40,000 patients.

In addition to taking over HealthSpan's medical offices, which closed March 31, MetroHealth has also opened two emergency departments in former HealthSpan buildings in Cleveland Heights and Parma.

"This is a unique opportunity for MetroHealth to expand access to care for patients throughout the communities we serve â€“ and do it without building new centers," said Dr. Akram Boutros, MetroHealth's chief executive. "As we work to transform care, one of our goals is to develop key partnerships that will improve quality and value."
