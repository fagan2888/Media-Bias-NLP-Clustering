The cabinet has cut the number of years a bank has to be registered before it conducts renminbi business from three to one, and scrapped a two-year profitability requirement.\n\nBanks now no longer have to first establish a China representative office before setting up other branches.\n\nUnder the new rules, branches of a foreign bank will not face obstacles to carrying out renminbi business if it already has one branch doing so.\n\nThe rules will take effect on Jan. 1.\n\nExperts told the news agency the revisions put foreign banks on an equal footing with local lenders.\n\nChina has been working to liberalise its financing sector, widening the band for bank deposit rates in late November and allowing brokerages to trade in the interbank foreign exchange market this month.
