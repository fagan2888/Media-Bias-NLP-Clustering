In comments to CMS, AMGA supported the idea of factoring partial year enrollees, who may have higher healthcare costs, into the risk adjustment methodology. AMGA also recommended that CMS consider socioeconomic and sociodemographic factors as part of its efforts to improve risk adjustment for plans offered on the ACA marketplaces.\n\n\n\n\u201cResearch indicates there is a relationship between socioeconomic status, race and ethnicity, and healthcare status and outcomes,\u201d said Donald W. Fisher, Ph.D., CAE, AMGA\u2019s president and chief executive officer. \u201cTo accurately account for the health mix of plan enrollees, these factors should be part of a risk adjustment methodology.\u201d\n\nAMGA also agreed with CMS that patient prescription drug use and high-cost enrollees are appropriate factors to consider when revising the risk adjustment methodology.\n\n\n\nRead AMGA\u2019s comments.\n\nAbout AMGA\n\nAMGA is a 501(c)(6) trade association representing medical groups, health systems, and other organized systems of care, including some of the nation's largest, most prestigious integrated delivery systems.
