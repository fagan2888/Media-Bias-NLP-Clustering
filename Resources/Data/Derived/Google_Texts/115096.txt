A white square the size of a large area rug is set into the center of a ballroom, chandeliers hanging overhead. We see someone in strappy platforms, from the ankles down, walk out onto the space.

The heels are carefully removed and replaced with— sparkly ice skates!

The camera pulls back. A man puts on what look like painters' pants and a white hooded coat with tails. Cue violins, and then — ta da! — the man spins and jumps as if he were on ice.

This is the scene in a trailer video prepared for "Legacy," an event organized by former "Project Runway" contestant and local fiber artist and fashion designer Timothy Westbrook (above). Leave it to Westbrook to embrace a winter pastime while finding a way to reject the actual ice.

The event, which Westbrook calls an "abstract fashion experience," will explore themes of angst related to finding one's path in life, particularly Westbrook's decision to call himself an artist.

It will include fashions, indoor figure skating (on some mysterious, hard material that makes this possible) and Westbrook's signature obsession: unicorns.

Everything in the show will be made from "art waste." Attendees are encouraged to "dress to express" with attire inspired by origami, surrealism and abstract painting.

The show is Wednesday in the Imperial Ballroom at the Pfister Hotel, 424 E. Wisconsin Ave., where Westbrook was an artist in residence.

Doors open at 7:30 p.m.; the performance starts at 8:30 p.m. Reception and other performances will follow. Tickets are $15.
