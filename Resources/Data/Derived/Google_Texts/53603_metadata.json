One Democrat voted with Republicans to take health care away from millions and 3 Republicans voted with Democrats against the bill.\n\nBefore the vote, Ways and Means Committee Ranking Member Sander Levin (D-MI) said, \u201cThis bill is reckless and has zero chance of becoming law. But most significantly, it\u2019s heartless. What it says from Republicans here to millions: an unhappy New Year. It could take health insurance away from 22 million people.\u201d\n\nHouse Republicans offered up the same untrue talking points that they have been using against the ACA for years.\n\nThere was nothing new said by Republicans that hasn\u2019t been said before, but conservatives are so out of touch that they are celebrating sending a bill to the desk of the President that he is certain to veto. In a statement, Heritage Action said, \u201cToday\u2019s vote and forthcoming and forthcoming presidential veto will provide momentum to help make the full repeal of Obamacare a reality in 2017.\u201d\n\nThe key takeaway from today\u2019s vote is that Republicans are showing every American what they plan to do if they win the White House and keep control of Congress.\n\nWhat House Republicans accomplished with this vote was shrink their support even more ahead of the presidential election. Millions of people would be negatively impacted if Obamacare repeal and Planned Parenthood defunding became law.\n\nIn his veto threat before the Senate voted on the reconciliation bill, Obama said:\n\nRepealing key elements of the Affordable Care Act would result in millions of individuals remaining uninsured or losing the insurance they have today. An estimated 17.6 million Americans gained coverage as several of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s coverage provisions have taken effect \u2013 15.3 million since the beginning of the first open enrollment in October 2013. The Senate amendment to H.R. 3762 would roll back coverage gains and would cost millions of hard-working middle-class families the security of affordable health coverage they deserve.\n\nRepealing the health care law would have implications far beyond these Americans who have or will gain insurance. More than 150 million Americans with employer-based insurance would be at risk of higher premiums and lower wages, or losing their coverage altogether. It would raise taxes on certain middle-class families. The Senate amendment to H.R. 3762 also would defund the Prevention and Public Health Fund, limit women\u2019s health care choices, and disproportionately impact low-income individuals.\n\nInstead of making their tent bigger, Republicans are dooming themselves to defeat. House Republicans continue to pander to the gerrymandered districts that got them elected instead of doing what is right for the rest of the country.\n\nHouse Republicans are running on a platform of taking away health care from tens of millions of Americans. It is a losing argument that is bound to be rejected by voters on Election Day 2016.", "article_metadata": {"description": "House Republicans began 2016 with a heartless and politically clueless vote to take health care away from 22 million Americans.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Jason Easley", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "House Republicans began 2016 with a heartless and politically clueless vote to take health care away from 22 million Americans.", "title": "Heartless House Republicans Vote To Take Health Care Away From 22 Million Americans", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2016/01/06/house-dooms-gop-2016-voting-repeal-obamacare-defund-planned-parenthood.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/ryan-meet-the-press.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-01-06T17:59:24+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Editors' Picks,Featured News,Issues,ACA repeal vote,house republicans vote to repeal obamacare,house votes to repeal obamacare,obama to veto ACA repeal bill,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Issues", "published_time": "2016-01-06T17:55:41+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-06T17:59:24+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "ACA repeal vote, house republicans vote to repeal obamacare, house votes to repeal obamacare, obama to veto ACA repeal bill"}, "article_summary": "House Republicans began 2016 with a heartless and politically clueless vote to take health care away from 22 million Americans.\n3762 also would defund the Prevention and Public Health Fund, limit women\u2019s health care choices, and disproportionately impact low-income individuals.\nHouse Republicans are running on a platform of taking away health care from tens of millions of Americans.\nOne Democrat voted with Republicans to take health care away from millions and 3 Republicans voted with Democrats against the bill.\nHouse Republicans continue to pander to the gerrymandered districts that got them elected instead of doing what is right for the rest of the country."}
