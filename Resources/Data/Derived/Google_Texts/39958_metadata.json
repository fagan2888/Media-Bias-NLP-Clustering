By his early 20s, he was a proven warrior, ultimately building up a confederacy of 32 tribes and more than 10,000 people during the War of 1812.\n\nHis defeat marked the end of the Indian resistance east of the Mississippi, said Lisa Gilbert, a War of 1812 historian. Never again did American Indians rise in rebellion with such force.\n\n\u201cOctober 5 was a very important date in Native history,\u201d she said. \u201cAs a result of Tecumseh\u2019s defeat, Natives were never again considered separate and equal partners in international relations.\u201d\n\nTecumseh is known for working with his brother, Tenskwatawa\u2014also called The Prophet\u2014to unite Native forces against the settlers. The brothers left Ohio in 1808 and settled in Indiana, at the juncture of the Wabash and Tippecanoe rivers. That settlement was destined to be the headquarters of an Indian confederacy and a training ground for warriors.\n\n\u201cTecumseh had a certain grandeur,\u201d said Charlene Houle, tourism development officer for the city of Chatham-Kent, Ontario, where the Battle of the Thames was fought 200 years ago. \u201cHe united all those people under him, thousands of people. He was one of those charismatic leaders who had a vision and worked to get it.\u201d\n\nTecumseh\u2019s plans were crushed in November 1811 when the U.S. Army, led by Gen. William Henry Harrison, defeated the Native forces at the Battle of Tippecanoe. After the loss, Tecumseh allied with the British against the U.S.\n\nThe alliance was forged on a desperate promise, Houle said. Tecumseh agreed to join British forces in exchange for his homeland.\n\nThat promise was never delivered. The British were retreating into Canada when Tecumseh and his warriors joined them. The Battle of the Thames marked the collapse of one of the greatest Native forces.\n\n\u201cTecumseh became a symbol of the potential for success and promises never lived up to,\u201d Houle said. \u201cHe has this legacy of being a great leader who was betrayed.\u201d\n\nAlthough only 500 Native warriors followed him to Canada, Tecumseh fought fiercely, once again facing Gen. Harrison on the battleground. The Native troops were outnumbered six to one.\n\nGilbert believes Tecumseh knew he would die there. Prior to the battle, the chief reportedly said that he \u201ccould not exactly tell, but it was an evil spirit which betokens no good.\u201d\n\n\u201cTecumseh had a premonition of his own death,\u201d she said. \u201cHe painted his face black that day.\u201d\n\nTecumseh was killed in the afternoon of October 5, 1813. He was 45.\n\n\u201cNo one knows exactly where he fell or who killed him,\u201d Gilbert said. \u201cThere still is controversy over where he was buried.\u201d\n\nAt least 24 people took credit for pulling the trigger that killed Tecumseh. Harrison, who served as the ninth U.S. president, built his reputation as \u201cvanquisher of Tecumseh,\u201d Gilbert said. Richard Mentor Johnson, the country\u2019s ninth vice president, also claimed to have killed the Shawnee chief.\n\nTecumseh\u2019s legacy has grown exponentially since his death. Once viewed as an enemy, he now is celebrated as a hero.\n\nGilbert attributes that legacy to Tecumseh\u2019s personality and charisma.\n\n\u201cOf all the Native leaders to emerge in the struggle against the U.S., Tecumseh had the charisma to band them together,\u201d she said. \u201cThe thing about Tecumseh is that he\u2019s still as charismatic as he was. Even 200 years later, he\u2019s still exerting that charisma beyond the grave.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "On October 5, 1813, Shawnee Chief Tecumseh was killed at the Battle of the Thames, just north of the U.S.-Canada border.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "leeanne", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2013/10/05/native-history-tecumseh-defeated-battle-thames-151604", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/uploads/2012/06/Death-of-Tecumseh-Battle-of-the-Thames-Nathaniel-Currier-e1339907505919.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Native History: Tecumseh Defeated at Battle of the Thames"}, "dcterms.date": "2013-10-05T13:00-04:00", "dc": {"title": "Native History: Tecumseh Defeated at Battle of the Thames"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2013/10/05/native-history-tecumseh-defeated-battle-thames-151604", "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Tecumseh, Shawnee, Native American History", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 8}, "dcterms.title": "Native History: Tecumseh Defeated at Battle of the Thames"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdaf97\"", "article_summary": "This Date in Native History: On October 5, 1813, Shawnee Chief Tecumseh was killed at the Battle of the Thames, just north of the U.S.-Canada border.\n\u201cThere still is controversy over where he was buried.\u201dAt least 24 people took credit for pulling the trigger that killed Tecumseh.\nThe Battle of the Thames marked the collapse of one of the greatest Native forces.\nHarrison, who served as the ninth U.S. president, built his reputation as \u201cvanquisher of Tecumseh,\u201d Gilbert said.\n\u201cTecumseh had a certain grandeur,\u201d said Charlene Houle, tourism development officer for the city of Chatham-Kent, Ontario, where the Battle of the Thames was fought 200 years ago."}
