Cardinal Lorenzo Baldisseri, General Secretary of the Synod, said that 85% of the conferences responded to the survey.\n\nThe document will be used as a guideline for discussions at a synod, a meeting of top Catholic bishops convened by Pope Francis, to be held in Rome in October.\n\nThe official name of the synod is \"The Pastoral Challenges of the Family in the Context of Evangelization.\"\n\nAnother synod to be held in October 2015, will provide further reflection on the questions before presenting a final document to the Pope.\n\nWell before the Vatican released Thursday's document, a national bishops' conference in Germany and Switzerland said their surveys exposed a wide gap between church teaching and lay Catholics' personal views.\n\n\"Most of the baptized have an image of the church that, on the one hand, is family friendly in its attitude, whilst at the same time considering her sexual morality to be unrealistic,\" the German bishops said, according to National Catholic Reporter.\n\nBishops in the United States declined to make their survey results public.\n\nWhile the Vatican document release Thursday does not change church teaching on homosexuality, it aligns with Pope Francis' softer tone toward gays and lesbians, made famous last July with his question, \"Who am I to judge?\"\n\nPope Francis on gays: 'Who am I to judge?'\n\nThe document firmly rejects gay marriage, for instance, but also said Catholics leaders, \u201care trying to find a balance between the Church\u2019s teaching on the family and a respectful, non-judgmental attitude towards people living in such unions.\u201d\n\n\u201cA distinction must be made,\u201d the Instrumentum Laboris says, \u201cbetween those who have made a personal, and often painful, choice and live that choice discreetly so as not to give scandal to others, and those whose behavior promotes and actively \u2013 often aggressively \u2013 calls attention to it.\u201d\n\nOne suggestion recommends, \u201cnot using phrases such as \u2018gay\u2019, \u2018lesbian\u2019 or \u2018homosexual\u2019 to define a person\u2019s identity,\u201d in order to \u201ctake every aspect of the person into consideration.\u201d\n\nHow to really measure the 'Francis effect'\n\nAnother suggestion is a \u201ctheological study in dialogue with the human sciences to develop a multi-faceted look at the phenomenon of homosexuality.\u201d\n\nThe document also emphasizes that when gay couples request baptism for their children, \u201cthe child must be received with the same care, tenderness and concern which is given to other children.\u201d\n\nOther topics to be addressed at the Synod include contraception, and in vitro fertilization, cohabitation, separated, divorced and remarried persons, and teen mothers.\n\n(CNN's Daniel Burke contributed reporting.)", "article_metadata": {"description": "By Delia Gallagher, CNN ROME (CNN) -- The\u00a0Vatican said Thursday that gays and
