Unemployment sits at 5.3 perecent, an all time state low.\n\n\u0093More people are working in South Carolina than ever before in the history of the state,\u0094 she said. \u0093To improve South Carolina you have to take care of all of South Carolina and that includes the rural areas.\u0094\n\nHaley touched on several topics during her 45-minute address, discussing the competition between the Palmetto State and Georgia as to who has the most efficient sea port; education and the need for all students to be able to read before entering fourth grade; the hidden catch with the local penny sales tax, and the five-year old Berkeley County hospital dispute, DHEC and the Certificate of Need program.\n\nOn which is better for shipping, Charleston or Savannah, Haley said, \u0093While I love the spirit of competition, our port is just better. We\u0092re deeper, we can service a larger variety and volume of ships, and we just do it better than they do.\u0094\n\nOn healthcare, specifically Obamacare, Haley remained adamant.\n\n\u0093Healthcare should be state based and not federal based,\u0094 she said. \u0093We will continue to resist and say, \u0091No,\u0092 to Obamacare.\u0094\n\nOn welfare, Haley said it is about finding out how to put welfare recipients to work.\n\n\u0093Before, you filled out the application and waited on your check. What we need to do is to find out what kind of skills these recipients have and find them jobs. They want to work. They want to make their families proud. Then you can take the 20,000 people off welfare and make them part of the workforce.\u0094\n\nOn education, the governor said children need to learn to read by the fourth grade if they want to continue progressing toward a diploma.\n\n\u0093More than 800,000 people in South Carolina don\u0092t have a G.E.D. and there are only 4.5 million people in the state\u0094 she said. \u0093We have to teach these kids to read.\n\n\u0093If a child can\u0092t read by the end of the third grade, they will not advance to the fourth grade. Statistics show if a student can\u0092t read by the fourth grade they are four times more likely not to graduate.\u0094\n\nHaley warned about what she called the hidden evils of local option penny sales taxes, saying to be careful what you wish for when approving them.\n\n\u0093Once they\u0092re here they never go away,\u0094 she said.\n\nHaley is also not a fan of the Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC) or the Certificate of Need (CON):\n\n\u0093I\u0092m not a fan of the CON. I think it is a wishing well for hospitals. Government needs to back out of this and let the businesses compete for their customer base. Hospitals are businesses, and when businesses compete, quality goes up while costs go down.\u0094\n\nHaley concluded her remarks by saying South Carolina\u0092s success is always going to be about jobs, \u0093Because people want to work. That is the heart of the American Dream, and when they say the American Dream is dead in South Carolina, we can proudly raise our heads and say, \u0091No, we are just getting started.\u0092\u0094\n\nHaley will face Democratic State Sen.
