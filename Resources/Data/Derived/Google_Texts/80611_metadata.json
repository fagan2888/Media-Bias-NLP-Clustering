Jeb Bush said Wednesday that Ohio Gov. John Kasich had a \u201cone-state strategy\u201d and knocked Mr. Kasich for expanding Medicaid under Obamacare.\n\n\u201cHe has nothing going on down here, best we can tell,\u201d Mr. Bush said on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe,\u201d speaking about South Carolina. \u201cHe had a one-state strategy, and it was effective and I commend him for the campaign he ran in New Hampshire.\u201d\n\n\u201cJohn\u2019s a good man. He\u2019s served as governor of the state of Ohio. He\u2019s done a good job,\u201d Mr. Bush said. \u201cBut he\u2019s not as conservative as me, and his record is not nearly as good as mine.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the one telling thing that he did, apart from not really focusing on rebuilding the military, which I think is important down here and in our country, is that when he had a chance, he expanded Obamacare through Medicaid,\u201d Mr. Bush said. \u201cGovernors across this country had a chance to take a stand against Obamacare \u2014 many did.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn Florida as a private citizen, I fought for stopping the expansion of Medicaid, and we were successful,\u201d Mr. Bush said. \u201cOther states did the same. But in Ohio, it was expanded. And he\u2019ll have to explain that down here where Obamacare, the people want it repealed. They don\u2019t want it expanded.\u201d\n\nMr. Kasich was on track to finish second behind businessman Donald Trump in the New Hampshire GOP presidential primary Tuesday, with Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas in third and Mr. Bush in fourth with 89 percent of precincts reporting Wednesday morning.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Former Florida Gov.
