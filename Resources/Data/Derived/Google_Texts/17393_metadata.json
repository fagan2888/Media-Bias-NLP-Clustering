We\u2019re going to lose. All that matters is winning, winning, winning.\u201d\n\nCoulter said it\u2019s much more sensible to go after seats Republicans don\u2019t already have than to spend time and money trying to replace Republicans.\n\n\u201cMay I say one name,\u201d Beck remarked. \u201cCharles Sumner.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s one that\u2019s [from] recent history,\u201d Coulter retorted sarcastically.\n\nWhile Beck insisted the U.S. is on the verge of seeing Republicans go the way of the Whig Party, Coulter said she\u2019d rather see a third party \u201ctaking votes from the Democrats.\u201d\n\nThe two also discussed specific politicians, particularly Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. As those who have been listening to Glenn Beck recently know, Beck has been on fire about replacing McConnell, saying he is a \u201creally bad guy.\u201d\n\nBut Coulter had to object there too: \u201c[McConnell] was the Ted Cruz on campaign finance reform \u2026 Mitch McConnell was so strong on that, was so brave, was attacked by the media, never backed down. And just one other point \u2014 he is leader of the Senate \u2026 he has to gather all the Republicans together.\u201d\n\nCoulter said McConnell is \u201csmarter than Trent Lott,\u201d \u201cmore conservative than Bob Dole,\u201d and that he managed to get \u201cevery single Republican to vote against Obamacare, including [Senators] Collins and Snowe.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you some stories off-air about Mitch McConnell,\u201d Beck promised. \u201cMitch McConnell is not exactly a friend of Mike Lee, Ted Cruz and you know that.\u201d\n\nCoulter repeated that McConnell doesn\u2019t have a history of attacking them publicly, but is the \u201cmost conservative and smartest\u201d leader of Republicans the U.S. Senate has had in her lifetime. Until she verifies these \u201csecret rumors off-air,\u201d Coulter said, she\u2019s going to stick up for the guy.\n\nBut both Coulter and Beck were able to agree that if you are going to replace one Republican senator, it should be Lindsey Graham of South Carolina.\n\n\u201cThat would scare the rest of them,\u201d Coulter remarked. \u201cAnd Lindsey Graham, what is he wrong on? Oh, everything. Syria, amnesty, Gang of Eight. Voted for Kagan, voted for Sotomayor. [He] wants to go to wars America doesn\u2019t need. I mean \u2014 I don\u2019t even understand what his position is.\u201d\n\nAnn Coulter: \u201cAll that matters is winning, winning, winning.\u201d Share:\n\nCoulter added that she\u2019s a bit \u201cannoyed\u201d with the congressional delegation from South Carolina, saying one needs to step up and run against Graham. Her favorite among the contenders would be Rep. Trey Gowdy, she said, and Beck and his co-hosts were completely on board.\n\nBut shortly thereafter, things heated back up again.\n\nWhen Beck asked what Coulter thinks of Matt Bevin, who is running against McConnell in Kentucky, Coulter remarked: \u201cNo, no, no. Stop! No, no. This is like Liz Cheney. No!\u201d\n\nShe explained that the situation is similar because Cheney is \u201crunning against a conservative Republican\u201d and we don\u2019t need primary fights, jokingly adding: \u201cNow I think you\u2019re a secret Democrat!\u201d\n\nCoulter proceeded to add one more point in McConnell\u2019s favor. \u201cMy third point is, how has Mitch McConnell voted differently than Rand Paul? And footnote here \u2014 did Mitch McConnell spend one month promoting amnesty before finally coming around like, oh, your looove Rand Paul?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure I love Rand Paul right now\u2026\u201d Beck responded with a laugh.\n\nCoulter said she\u2019s in no way attacking Paul, but that \u201cMcConnell has voted the same way \u2026 is it worth having a vicious primary in Wyoming, in Kentucky?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily what Mitch McConnell does in his votes,\u201d Beck said. \u201cIt\u2019s what Mitch McConnell does behind the scenes.\u201d\n\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nThe two concluded on a positive note, agreeing that Beck\u2019s new mantra \u201c#DefundTheGOP\u201d is admirable in the sense of cutting off funding to the Republican establishment in Washington, instead choosing the candidates and organizations you truly want to support.\n\nWhere Coulter disagrees, she said, is attacking Republicans who can\u2019t vote \u201cdown the line\u201d conservative because they come from the equivalent of the Soviet Union, like Massachusetts.\n\n\u201cPick the ones \u2026 [that] are really hateful\u201d and go after them, she suggested.\n\nWhat conservatives need to do, Coulter said, is imagine how the \u201cnon-Fox media\u201d would be covering the Democrats if the situation were reversed, and Republicans had been in charge. How would they be treating the by almost all accounts disastrous Obamacare rollout? The economy? Jobs?\n\n\u201cThis is the point of the beginning of my book here,\u201d Coulter said. \u201cWe need the ruthlessness of the Democrats without their crazy ideas.\u201d\n\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nThe full episode of The Glenn Beck Program, along with many other live streaming shows and thousands of hours of on-demand content, is available on just about any digital device.
