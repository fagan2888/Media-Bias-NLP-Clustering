Ireland’s government has joined Microsoft in opposing a U.S. court order to obtain emails stored in the tech giant’s cloud data server located in Dublin, noting the case could have heavy consequences for international sovereignty and digital privacy.

Tech companies host their user’s personal information in data servers around the world, and the government since last year has sought emails of an unidentified user through court order. The Obama administration has argued that a company based in the U.S. must comply with government data requests no matter where the data is stored.

Microsoft fought the order in district court and lost, but is now appealing the decision in the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, arguing that it violates the Fourth Amendment requirement that a government search request must be particular in its scope. The decision also could damage trust in U.S. technology companies and spur other nations to seek data stored on servers located outside their borders, the company argued.

“The government cannot seek and a court cannot issue a warrant allowing federal agents to break down the doors of Microsoft’s Dublin facility,” the company said in documents filed to the District Court.

European officials agreed with Microsoft on Wednesday when the Irish government and Jan Philipp Albrecht, a member of the European Parliament from Germany, filed separate court briefs in support of Microsoft’s argument.

The Irish government said in its brief that it is interested in cooperating with U.S. law enforcement but not at the expense of its national sovereignty or the privacy of its citizens.
