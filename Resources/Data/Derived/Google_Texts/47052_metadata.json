Within this set, they looked for accidents related to surfing, mountain biking, motocross, skateboarding, snowmobiling, snowboarding, and skiing. They found that more than 4 million cases fit the description.\n\nThe results, which will be presented at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) in New Orleans, show that one out of every 10 injuries linked to these seven sports are to the head or neck. About 2.5 percent of these were classified as severe, which means that they involved fractures. Skull injuries were by far the most common.\n\nThe sport that produced the most injuries was skateboarding, with more than 129,000 head and neck injuries recorded over the 11-year period. At a close second was snowboarding, which was associated with 97,000 cases. Skiing and motocross were third and fourth, with 83,000 and 78,000 cases, respectively.\n\nWhat\u2019s worse, there\u2019s good reason to believe that these figures will continue to rise, as extreme sports appear to be gaining more popularity each year. The number of Americans who skateboard, for example, has grown by nearly 50 percent since 1999. Today, more than 14 million skate on a regular basis.\n\n\u201cThe research provides a baseline to further study head and neck injuries among extreme sport participants,\u201d Sabesa explained. \u201cThere\u2019s an understanding that these sports are growing in participation, and that they can result in significant injuries.\u201d\n\nSabesa added that improving safety is possible, but will require efforts from parents as well as organizers. \u201cIn general we need to make sure protective equipment is available \u2014 such as helmets and wrist guards \u2014 and encouraged. And we need to make sure we provide medical care and team doctors on site, and that kids know that it's possible to get a concussion when doing these sports and are encouraged to seek medical help when there's any concern,\u201d she told reporters.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "extreme sports, neck injuries, head injuries, national electronic injury surveillance system, skateboarding, snowboarding, skateboarding head and neck injuries", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Skateboarding, snowboarding, and other extreme sports account for more than 40,000 head and neck injuries each year, a new study finds.", "title": "Extreme Sports Cause 4 Head And Neck Injuries Every Hour", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/extreme-sports-cause-40000-head-and-neck-injuries-each-year-how-can-organizers-and-parents-improve", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/16/skate.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Skateboarding, snowboarding, and other extreme sports account for more than 40,000 head and neck injuries each year, a new study finds.", "title": "Extreme Sports Cause 4 Head And Neck Injuries Every Hour", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/extreme-sports-cause-40000-head-and-neck-injuries-each-year-how-can-organizers-and-parents-improve", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/16/skate.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/16/skate.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-03-16T15:03:38-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-03-16T15:03:37-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Skateboarding, snowboarding, and other extreme sports account for more than 40,000 head and neck injuries each year, a new study finds."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdba44\"", "article_summary": "Skateboarding, snowboarding, and other extreme sports account for more than 40,000 head and neck injuries each year, a new study finds.\n\u201cThe research provides a baseline to further study head and neck injuries among extreme sport participants,\u201d Sabesa explained.\nThe sport that produced the most injuries was skateboarding, with more than 129,000 head and neck injuries recorded over the 11-year period.\nEach year, extreme sports is the direct cause of thousands of head and neck injuries among non-professionals, according to a new study that underscores the importance of thinking twice before mimicking TV stunts.\nWithin this set, they looked for accidents related to surfing, mountain biking, motocross, skateboarding, snowmobiling, snowboarding, and skiing."}
