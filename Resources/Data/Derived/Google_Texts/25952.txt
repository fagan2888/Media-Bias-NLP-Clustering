CHARLOTTE, N.C. — For the second consecutive week, Washington Redskins inside linebacker Keenan Robinson is inactive as he recovers from a stinger.

Robinson was limited in practice all week and was listed as questionable. Will Compton will again start in place of Robinson alongside Perry Riley Jr.

Even if Robinson was healthy, it is likely Compton would still start. The play among inside linebackers improved last week with Compton on the field. He had eight tackles against the New Orleans Saints last week and 10 the week before against the New England Patriots.

The other inactive players are quarterback Robert Griffin III, strong safety Trenton Robinson, wide receiver Rashad Ross, left guard Arie Kouandjio, tight end Anthony McCoy and defensive end Frank Kearse.

Trenton Robinson injured a hamstring against the Saints, but had already lost the starting job to Jeron Johnson. Johnson played 49 snaps against the Patriots after Robinson struggled. Johsnon started against New Orleans and played 20 snaps, while cornerback DeAngelo Hall played in sub packages.

Wide receiver Andre Roberts is expected to resume his role as the Redskins‘ kickoff returner after missing last week’s game with an ankle injury.
