Perception is reality for the public.\u201d\n\nCo-host Brian Kilmeade also got in on the discussion by blasting Grande for making the decision to walk into the shop and using that as an opportunity to make comments about the entire country. Vail said that she did not know what the solution to the problem was, but speculated as to what was truly the root of all evil on this issue:\n\nFor the past six or seven years \u2014 and that\u2019s a good chunk of a millennials\u2019 adult life \u2013 we\u2019ve had a president who doesn\u2019t believe in American exceptionalism and doesn\u2019t speak up for the American values this country was built on. Can you blame millennials for their modicum of patriotism when for the majority of our adult lifetime, we have not witnessed anything to make us think differently?\n\nVail concluded by saying that Grande acted like an entitled diva with no sense of gratitude, and expressed her hopes that she loses fans from the incident.\n\nYou can watch the segment here, via Fox:\n\nWatch the latest video at video.foxnews.com\n\n[h/t Raw Story]\n\n[Image via Fox/sreencap]\n\n\u2014 \u2014\n\n>> Follow Ken Meyer (@KenMeyer91) on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ariana Grande has apologized for licking donuts at a pastry shop and saying that she hates America, but Fox & Friends said that there was an issue of patriotism", "generator": "WordPress 2016.21", "og": {"image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/PicMonkey-Collage-Fox-Grande.jpg", "title": "Fox & Friends Guest Blames Obama for Ariana Grande and Unpatriotic Millennials"}, "twitter": {"description": "Ariana Grande has apologized for licking donuts at a pastry shop and saying that she hates America, but Fox & Friends said that there was an issue of patriotism behind the incident, and Obama is to blame.", "title": "Fox & Friends Guest Blames Obama for Ariana Grande and Unpatriotic Millennials", "image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/PicMonkey-Collage-Fox-Grande.jpg", "creator": "@KenMeyer91", "site": "@mediaite", "card": "summary"}, "NextGEN": "1.5.5", "date": "2015-07-09T14:38:08+00:00", "keywords": "tv", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.5, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2bb5\"", "article_summary": "Vail concluded by saying that Grande acted like an entitled diva with no sense of gratitude, and expressed her hopes that she loses fans from the incident.\n\u201cShe should know as a public figure that everything you say and do is taken at face-value.\nYou can watch the segment here, via Fox:Watch the latest video at video.foxnews.com[h/t Raw Story][Image via Fox/sreencap]\u2014 \u2014>> Follow Ken Meyer (@KenMeyer91) on Twitter\nCan you blame millennials for their modicum of patriotism when for the majority of our adult lifetime, we have not witnessed anything to make us think differently?\nPerception is reality for the public.\u201dCo-host Brian Kilmeade also got in on the discussion by blasting Grande for making the decision to walk into the shop and using that as an opportunity to make comments about the entire country."}
