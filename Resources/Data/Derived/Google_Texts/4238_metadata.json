Chatter ceased, heads bowed.\n\nAfter praying for humanity and for the country, Williamson offered up, \u201cMay love prevail. And so it is.\u201d The rapt audience replied in turn: \u201cAnd so it is.\u201d\n\nWilliamson, 61, beloved by fans (including Oprah) for her warm writings on transforming the heart and soul, is seeking to convince voters to send her to gridlocked Washington, D.C., in her quest for California\u2019s 33rd District seat.\n\nIt\u2019s a decision Williamson calls a \u201clateral move,\u201d in keeping with her career\u2019s trajectory, which took off after the 1992 best-selling book \u201cA Return to Love.\u201d\n\nWith about four months before primary elections, Williamson is seeking to tap into widespread discontent and disillusionment and apply her own brand of well-packaged, transformational wisdom to stoke \u201ca people\u2019s movement.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the people who have to intervene, because the political status quo is part of what has taken us to where we are,\u201d Williamson said in an interview this week, highlighting corporate money as a primary cause for the present state of affairs. \u201cIt\u2019s an all-hands-on-deck moment.\u201d\n\nWilliamson launched her campaign in October. She wants to end the status quo of capitulation to corporate money in politics and encourage an engaged, loving electorate. A lifelong Democrat, Williamson registered as an Independent \u2014 bypassing party structure in order to challenge incumbent, Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif. Last month Waxman announced his retirement, capping off 20 terms as the district\u2019s representative.\n\nWith Waxman out, many people have jumped at the opportunity to represent the district, which includes some of Southern California\u2019s toniest areas \u2014 Malibu, Beverly Hills and Santa Monica \u2014 populated by heavyweight Democratic fundraisers. In addition to Williamson, they include producer and director Brent Roske, a fellow Independent, along with two seasoned Democratic politicians: state Sen. Ted Lieu, and former Los Angeles controller Wendy Greuel.\n\nWilliamson\u2019s campaign logo \u201cCreate Anew,\u201d is emblazoned on sweatshop-free T-shirts from American Apparel and features a band of doves flying over an American flag.\n\nWilliamson\u2019s platform gets beyond abstracts, just barely. It outlines what\u2019s worrisome about contemporary society, from mass incarceration to climate change to health care inaccessibility, with little by way of policy proposals. For example, Williamson vows to \u201cwork closely with\u201d supporters of the Affordable Care Act. She opposes nuclear energy and will do \u201ceverything possible\u201d to minimize the power of pesticide makers.\n\nOn education, Williamson wants universal pre-K education, fully funded college tuition for qualified students, and more options to attend trade and technical programs.\n\nBut it\u2019s not policy prescriptions that draw 43-year-old Tyrus Wilson, a waitress and artist, to support Williamson\u2019s candidacy.\n\n\u201cIt would be nice to have some heart in politics,\u201d said Wilson, who attends weekly volunteer meetings for the Williamson campaign in Venice.\n\n\u201cI feel that she genuinely wants to heal America,\u201d added Amy Elizabeth, a Beverly Hills-based Pilates instructor who is also a regular at Williamson\u2019s weekly spiritual lectures at a West L.A. theater.\n\nStill, political consultant Donna Bojarsky concluded that effective spiritual teaching and effective politicking require different skill sets.\n\n\u201cShe has a steep hill to climb,\u201d said Bojarsky, who specializes in consulting to Hollywood elite, many of whom live in the 33rd District.\n\nWilliamson concedes building up a campaign is difficult, but bristles at the idea that she\u2019s reaching beyond her orbit: She penned a book on politics in 1997, and founded Project Angel Food, a nonprofit that provides food to those affected by HIV/AIDS.\n\nAnd if her candidacy draws mockery \u2014 that of a political neophyte with grandiose ambitions \u2014 Williamson said it\u2019s predictable.\n\n\u201cIf anything is naive and lightweight,\u201d said Williamson, \u201cit\u2019s the traditional political conversation.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "LOS ANGELES (RNS) It\u2019s not a typical campaign for U.S. Congress, and that\u2019s the point.\n\nBest-selling author and spiritual lecturer Marianne Williamson ...", "sailthru.expire_date": "2014-02-08 12:54:23 -0500", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "LOS ANGELES (RNS) It\u2019s not a typical campaign for U.S. Congress, and that\u2019s the point.\n\nBest-selling author and spiritual lecturer Marianne Williamson ...", "title": "Marianne Williamson Looks To Pray Her Way To Congress", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/02/07/marianne-williamson-prayer-congress_n_4746435.html", "image": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1609211/images/o-MARIANNE-WILLIAMSON-facebook.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1609211/images/o-MARIANNE-WILLIAMSON-facebook.jpg", "height": 1000}, "title": "Marianne Williamson Looks To Pray Her Way To Congress", "description": "LOS ANGELES (RNS) It\u2019s not a typical campaign for U.S. Congress, and that\u2019s the point.\n\nBest-selling author and spiritual lecturer Marianne Williamson ...", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@HuffPostRelig"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-02-07 12:54:23 -0500", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=4746435", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "religion", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "marianne williamson prayer congress,Marianne Williamson,marianne williamson congress,marianne williamson religious,marianne williamson politics,marianne williamson create anew", "article": {"section": "Religion", "tag": "marianne williamson prayer congress,Marianne Williamson,marianne williamson congress,marianne williamson religious,marianne williamson politics,marianne williamson create anew", "published_time": "2014-02-07 12:54:23 -0500", "modified_time": "2014-02-07 12:59:01 -0500"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "article_summary": "On education, Williamson wants universal pre-K education, fully funded college tuition for qualified students, and more options to attend trade and technical programs.\nWilliamson\u2019s campaign logo \u201cCreate Anew,\u201d is emblazoned on sweatshop-free T-shirts from American Apparel and features a band of doves flying over an American flag.\n\u201cIt would be nice to have some heart in politics,\u201d said Wilson, who attends weekly volunteer meetings for the Williamson campaign in Venice.\nAnd if her candidacy draws mockery \u2014 that of a political neophyte with grandiose ambitions \u2014 Williamson said it\u2019s predictable.\nBest-selling author and spiritual lecturer Marianne Williamson closed out a campaign volunteer meeting Thursday (Feb. 6), by beckoning the crowd of about 100 people to do what she does naturally \u2014 pray."}
