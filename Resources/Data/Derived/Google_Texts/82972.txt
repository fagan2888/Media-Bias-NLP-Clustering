The Edwards Street Fellowship Center located in Hattiesburg will open up a new free medical clinic next to its food pantry.

The Fellowship Health Clinic will have three components: dental, pharmaceutical and medical.

This will be the only clinic of its kind in the Harrisburg area, which will also be fully integrated.

Hattiesburg Clinic has played a substantial role in this clinic be donating such things as exam tables and other equipment.

Twenty-One percent of Hattiesburg-area resident do not have health coverage, according to 2014 data from the Mississippi Department of Health.

“Patients receive every service here totally free of charge,” said Ann McCullen, executive director of Edwards Street Fellowship Center. “This is available to adults in the Forrest and Lamar Counties who do not have any insurance at all. Some people have found that they can’t afford even the Affordable Care Act insurance because of the premiums and because there are co-payments and deductibles. And it may be that we morph into something else where it’s more of an underinsured population who we see.”

The fellowship's mission statement includes that it will treat the uninsured and underinsured residents of those two counties.

Also, nursing students from The University of Southern Mississippi as well as medical students from William Carey University will be part of the student staff at the clinic.

The pharmaceutical component will come from the Saint Vincent De Paul Community Pharmacy from Biloxi to provide free prescription medicine that is non-controlled.

A dedication service for the new clinic will take place Jan. 10 at 2 p.m.
