We pray for their families. God, we pray that you bring them the comfort, the peace that only you can bring. \u2026 God, we just pray that you will bring comfort to the parents, the siblings, the spouses, the children that are left behind. \u2026 We pray that you will give them faith and an understanding. Father, we pray for resolve in our nation as we confront evil and our enemies. Lord, we pray for healing for the people of Chattanooga in Tennessee. Lord, we, in a special way, lift up our men and women in uniform to your protection. God, we give you thanks for their courage, their service, and their loyalty\u2026\n\nFederal officials are treating the incident as an act of domestic terrorism, but have cautioned that an investigation would determine how the shooting was classified.\n\nJindal was ready to go a step further.\n\n\u201cIt seems pretty clear from what we already know that this is an act of not only terrorism, but radical Islamic terrorism,\u201dJindal said. \u201cThe reality is this: There is evil in the world.\u201d\n\nJindal believes that building up the military, not cutting 40,000 troops, is what America needs to keep up with growing threats to the country from around the world.\n\nJindal said, \u201cI would like our commander-in-chief to wage war on radical Islamic terrorism.\u201d\n\nIf elected president, securing the borders and investing in national defense will be top priorities for Jindal.\n\nMrs. Supriya Jindal introduced 2016 presidential candidate & Louisiana Gov. @BobbyJindal in Waterloo, Iowa, tonight. pic.twitter.com/3PwX9aAZD5 \u2014 Leah Jessen (@_LeahKay_) July 17, 2015\n\nBringing his wife along to the event, Jindal stood strongly to his view that marriage is between one man and one woman. \u201cMy Christian views do not evolve or change with the polls,\u201d he said.\n\nJindal also holds a pro-life view and criticized Planned Parenthood.\n\nCalling the recent Planned Parenthood video \u201cdisgusting\u201d and \u201cgrotesque,\u201d Jindal said, \u201cWhat an awful, offensive video.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt certainly looks like they are talking about illegal human trafficking and sale of fetal body parts,\u201d he claimed.\n\nJindal noted that his state of Louisiana has been the most pro-life state for the last six years.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to stand for life in Louisiana and America,\u201d Jindal said.\n\n.@BobbyJindal & Mrs. Jindal met with folks in Waterloo, Iowa, tonight.
