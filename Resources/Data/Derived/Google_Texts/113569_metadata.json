Photograph By Gerry Kahrmann, The Province\n\nA University of B.C. professor who studies public health is himself having trouble finding a family doctor.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m actually in the camp of not being able to find a GP,\u201d said Jason Sutherland, a professor at UBC\u2019s centre for health services and policy research.\n\n\u201cI see the irony \u2014 it\u2019s not lost on me.\u201d\n\nSutherland , 44, grew up in the Okanagan and studied in B.C. He taught at American universities before getting his job at UBC about five years ago.\n\n\u201cI did look (for a family doctor), and the only openings were more over toward Boundary Road (in Burnaby), quite a ways away,\u201d he said. \u201cI live on campus and walk in to work. It just wasn\u2019t making sense for me (to go out to Burnaby), so I just found this walk-in clinic where there\u2019s only a couple of physicians.\u201d\n\nFor a single, healthy guy with nothing more than the odd sports injury to deal with, that arrangement worked well.\n\nBut Sutherland is now married and became a father last fall. The birth of his child coincided with an opportunity to work in Washington, D.C., for just over a year to study the effects of U.S. President Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Health Care Act.\n\nSutherland and his family had no trouble finding a family doctor in D.C., but they\u2019re coming back to Vancouver in January, when Sutherland will resume his teaching duties.\n\nAnd that\u2019s when they\u2019ll renew their search for a family doctor.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll want the continuity of care that a single doc provides. For pediatric-based care you\u2019re going to want that kind of doctor,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Sutherland doesn\u2019t expect to find one close to his Vancouver home.\n\n\u201cI phoned quite a few clinics to see if they were accepting patients and they were not. Around UBC, Point Grey, even in south Vancouver, it\u2019s hard to get in.\u201d\n\nFamily doctors typically take on from 1,200 to 1,500 patients, he said.\n\n\u201cOnce their roster is full they do not want to take on more patients,\u201d he said.\n\nPeople with uncomplicated health issues turn to walk-in clinics, which can work for generally healthy people, he said, but not so well for those with chronic or complex conditions.\n\n\u201cThese walk-in clinics are doing a barn-burning business,\u201d said Sutherland, whose specific area of study is how financial incentives affect hospitals and doctors.\n\n\u201cThe physicians are paid on a piecemeal basis. They spend approximately six minutes per patient and they just grind through. There\u2019s a huge demand for the services. I just think, \u2018What a great business model.\u2019\u201d\n\nSHORTAGE IS GROWING\n\nDoctors of B.C. (formerly the B.C. Medical Association) estimates that some 220,000 British Columbians don\u2019t have a family doctor, up from 176,000 in 2005.\n\n\u201cAbout half are actually looking for a physician, half don\u2019t really care because they\u2019re young and healthy,\u201d said association president Dr. Bill Cavers, a 63-year-old family doctor in Victoria.\n\n\u201cBut the half that are looking are desperate, because many of them are at the age where they\u2019re starting to get chronic ailments and some problems.\u201d Cavers, who co-chaired a BCMA committee on family practice from 2002 to 2010, has been part of the effort to address the shortage of family doctors.\n\nHe was in the audience at a press conference in 2010 when then health minister Kevin Falcon promised a family doctor for every British Columbian by 2015.\n\n\u201cI was there with my co-chair,\u201d Cavers recalled. \u201cWe looked at each other and said, \u2018Oh, I guess we\u2019re committed now.\u2019 After our dizziness and light-headedness stopped, we realized there\u2019s nothing like working under a deadline.\u201d\n\nThat deadline has arrived but the shortage of family doctors persists.\n\nA study by UBC public health researchers Kim McGrail and Ruth Lavergne noted that the province has spent $1 billion to improve primary care since 2006, with more than $700 million of that going to incentives for doctors to encourage the traditional family practice model.\n\nThose incentives include additional payments \u2014 on top of regular fees \u2014 to doctors for providing mental-health care and palliative care, and for the management of patients with chronic diseases.\n\nDespite those incentives, family doctors already in practice are turning away new patients because their rosters are full. Many new doctors are choosing to join walk-in clinics rather than taking on the responsibility and costs of setting up a family practice.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a whole skein of different issues in there,\u201d Cavers said of the family-doctor shortage, adding that there\u2019s an increasing demand for medical services by aging boomers.\n\nAnd family doctors aren\u2019t working the kind of hours they once did, said Cavers.\n\n\u201cGone are the days when a doctor worked outside of the house and the doctor\u2019s spouse worked inside the house. We now have two-career families,\u201d said Cavers, who worked a 50-hour week as a doctor before he became head of Doctors of B.C.\n\n\u201cNow physicians are trying to balance that. They\u2019re not working the total number of hours that old guys like me used to work.\u201d\n\nThe committee Cavers helped start in 2002 was aimed at increasing the number of doctors in family practice. That year, only 23 per cent of B.C.\u2019s medical school grads chose family practice, he said. The latest numbers show 40 per cent of today\u2019s grads are choosing that option.\n\nThe University of B.C. medical school has expanded from Vancouver to train doctors in Victoria, Kelowna and Prince George, with graduate numbers rising from 128 in 2003 to 288 each year since 2011. UBC has the fifth-largest medical student population in North America. Residency spots in B.C. for international medical grads went up from six in 2003 to 50 this year, and will rise to 58 next year.\n\n\u201cThe bad news is, we estimate we need about 450 new physicians in B.C. per year to meet demand, and we\u2019re only graduating 288,\u201d Cavers said.\n\nB.C. Health Minister Terry Lake acknowledges the continuing shortage.\n\n\u201cEven with more doctors, accessibility seems to be reduced,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd, of course, we\u2019ve got an aging population so the demand is higher.\u201d\n\nReferring to the 2015 deadline, Lake said, \u201cWe\u2019re maybe not as far ahead as we wanted to be at this stage, but I think we\u2019re on the verge of some real positive changes now.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t get the 2014 numbers until June from Statistics Canada. If we see the needle start coming down on the number of people without a doctor, that will be a good sign that we\u2019re on the right track.\u201d\n\nAs for all those patients still looking for doctors \u2014 and those retiring doctors who can\u2019t find younger colleagues to take over their practices \u2014 Cavers admits there\u2019s going to be more of a wait.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to say keep your eyes peeled for changes in the next 12 to 24 months,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do expect there will be significant improvements in the next couple of years.\n\n\u201cAlthough we found that 2015 was an ambitious goal, it certainly did assist in helping us to giddy-up.\u201d\n\n\u2018I HAVE TO WAIT FOR UP TO THREE HOURS SOMETIMES\u2019\n\nLouise Setchell had the same family doctor her whole life while growing up in England, but since she moved to B.C. in 2009 she\u2019s had a revolving door of at least 12 different physicians.\n\nWhen Setchell, 31, gave birth to her son Mateo five months ago, her partner\u2019s doctor agreed to accept the baby as a patient, but wouldn\u2019t take Louise because the doctor was nearing retirement.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been trying to get a family doctor since I moved here. Every time I\u2019ve managed to find one \u2014 it has happened three times now \u2014 they\u2019ve up and left,\u201d Setchell said.\n\nHer last family doctor confirmed Setchell\u2019s pregnancy, after which Setchell had a midwife attend the birth. When Setchell sought to make a post-pregnancy appointment at her practice, she found that her doctor had had a baby and moved to Toronto.\n\nSetchell, who is on maternity leave from her job as a psychiatric nurse, hasn\u2019t been able to find a new family doctor since. The B.C. College of Physicians and Surgeons has a website (cpsbc.ca) that lists doctors accepting new patients, but it\u2019s \u00adfrequently out of date. Setchell has been relying on walk-in clinics, as many do, but said she misses the continuity of seeing the same doctor every time.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous that I don\u2019t get to see the same person,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is causing me hardship because there are cancer issues in my family, so I have to go to the doctor every year without fail to go and get checked out.\u201d\n\nShe needs an annual exam to renew her contraceptive pill prescription and it\u2019s done by a different doctor every time, she said.\n\n\u201cSo I have to see a strange female,\u201d she said. \u201cOne time I had to see a male doctor that I\u2019d never seen before. I was told at a walk-in clinic that it was a female doctor I\u2019d be seeing.\u201d\n\nSetchell and her family live in New Westminster and she goes to a walk-in clinic at the Vancouver-Burnaby border.\n\n\u201cI have to wait for up to three hours sometimes for the chance of seeing somebody,\u201d she said. \u201cThey need more doctors who are willing to take on a family practice rather than working in a walk-in clinic.\u201d\n\n\u2018IT\u2019S ABOUT HAVING SOMEBODY REGULAR THAT WE CAN SEE\u2019\n\nNatalie Kootchin hasn\u2019t had a family doctor since she left her Vancouver Island home for the mainland as a teen.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t had anyone since my childhood family doctor,\u201d she said.\n\nNow 32 and living in Vancouver, Kootchin got through her 20s by using walk-in clinics when she needed to see a doctor.\n\nBut when she got pregnant last year, Kootchin started looking for a family doctor close to her home for herself, her husband and their baby, due this May.\n\nSo far, she\u2019s come up empty.\n\n\u201cI have found it difficult,\u201d she said. \u201cI only have a couple of months left to try to find a family doctor that I can see with the baby.\u201d\n\nShe has arranged midwives and a doula, and is registered to give birth at B.C. Women\u2019s Hospital, but she wants a family doctor for after the baby is born.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about the ongoing care afterwards, having somebody regular that we can see,\u201d said Kootchin, who works as a human resources consultant.\n\n\u201cMy plan in the meantime is, there\u2019s a walk-in clinic near me and I know there are family doctors there that are good. I can call ahead, find out when they\u2019re working and try to get in to see them,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t take appointments. It\u2019s not ideal.\u201d\n\nIronically, Kootchin and her husband live a five-minute walk from the cluster of doctors\u2019 offices around Vancouver General Hospital.\n\n\u201cYou would think it would be easier,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s so many medical offices in the Broadway-Cambie-Williow area.\u201d\n\n\u2018I\u2019M NOT A ONE-ISSUE PERSON\u2019\n\nBarbara Bird has to drive an hour-and-a-half from her Chilliwack home to see her family doctor in Vancouver.\n\n\u201cI would not travel to Vancouver to see a doctor if I didn\u2019t have to,\u201d said the 58-year-old Bird, who suffers damaged joints from rheumatoid arthritis. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to find one in Chilliwack. I\u2019ve been living here for about four-and-a-half years. Still haven\u2019t been able to find one.\u201d\n\nBird worries what will happen when her family doctor of 40 years retires.\n\nBird was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis in 1997. Three years ago she had to quit her desk job because of complications from the condition and side effects of the medication she takes to treat it.\n\n\u201cYou should see how thick my file is,\u201d Bird said.\n\nThe medications she takes to ease her symptoms leave her susceptible to infections, including bouts of pneumonia so severe that the coughing has given her broken ribs. She also suffers from asthma.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a one-issue person,\u201d she said of her health. \u201cI can\u2019t help that. It\u2019s just my life.\u201d\n\nBird said her GP, who has been treating her since she was 19, takes the time to discuss her myriad health issues at appointments, while doctors she has seen at walk-in clinics in Chilliwack and Surrey often refuse to discuss more than one health problem per visit.\n\n\u201cMy doctor is an old-school doctor. If you see the newer ones, you can only come in for one issue. You\u2019ve got 15 minutes and you\u2019re out of there,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThe fact that I have RA means that I have more issues when I do get sick. So if I have a doctor who has an understanding of RA, the medications that I take for it and the side effects of those medications, it makes a huge difference. Otherwise, I\u2019m the one who has to go in and educate them.\u201d\n\nThe typical wait time of more than an hour at walk-in clinics is hard for Bird because sitting still that long aggravates her condition.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re sitting for a long time you can barely walk afterwards.\u201d\n\nPRACTISING OUTSIDE THE FEE-FOR-VISIT BOX\n\nDr. Mitchell Fagan and his colleagues at Langley\u2019s Murrayville family-practice group don\u2019t charge for every patient visit to their office.\n\n\u201cWe instead get paid to look after people,\u201d said Fagan, who is also in charge of training family-practice residents at Langley General Hospital.\n\nMurrayville\u2019s four doctors, two registered nurses and several nurse practitioners care for nearly 9,000 patients in what started as a pilot project 11 years ago.\n\nEach of the patients is assessed by the Medical Services Plan based on age, sex and complexity, after which the practice is paid a straight annual fee for each patient based on that assessment.\n\nThe pilot funding arrangement has allowed Fagan and his partner to hire a mix of doctors, nurses, therapists and nurse practitioners out of Murrayville\u2019s annual budget. The arrangement would have been impossible under the traditional MSP system that pays doctors a fee for each patient visit.\n\nAt the Murrayville practice, a patient might be seen by a registered nurse (RN) or a nurse practitioner rather than a doctor, depending on the specific reason for the visit.\n\nNurse practitioners, a relatively new class of health provider first regulated in B.C. in 2005, are able to perform 80 per cent of the services done by doctors, including diagnoses, writing prescriptions and ordering lab tests.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s helped us to do more in the day more effectively,\u201d he said. \u201cFor us, we were able to bring in an RN who is an expert in diabetes. Things that might have taken me half an hour to do, I can now do without ever having to see the person, because she\u2019s responsible and we\u2019re able to receive remuneration for it.\u201d\n\nThe model could also help encourage younger doctors to go into family practice by giving them an alternative to setting up a practice of their own, which involves office costs and responsibility for the ongoing care of patients with complicated health issues.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really germane to the whole future of primary care,\u201d Fagan said. \u201cIt\u2019s about partnership. It\u2019s about young docs who are coming out from training who are not yet comfortable with the idea of being on their own, but there aren\u2019t a lot of other practice opportunities for them.\u201d\n\nThe pilot funding model isn\u2019t available to other doctors in B.C. beyond five practices in Langley, including Murrayville, and two in Vancouver where it\u2019s already in use, but the Doctors of B.C.\u2019s general practice services committee is studying it.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve really been privileged to be partners with the health authority and the government ... being allowed to do this,\u201d Fagan said. \u201cIt\u2019s given us the opportunity to show you can do health care differently.\u201d\n\nBY THE NUMBERS\n\n\u2022 As of 2014, the B.C. College of Physicians and Surgeons listed 11,361 doctors: 5,875 of the total are GPs and 5,486 are specialists.\n\n\u2022 The usual fee for an in-office visit to a family doctor for a patient between the ages of two and 49 is $30.15.\n\n\u2022 Doctors of B.C. says that for GPs, about 45 per cent of money collected from fees goes to covering the doctor\u2019s overhead costs (staff salaries, insurance, office lease, utilities, equipment).\n\nThere is a daily limit on how many patients a doctor will be paid to see. Doctors receive:\n\n\u2022 Full payment for each of up to 50 office visits per day;\n\n\u2022 50 per cent payment for 51 to 65 office visits;\n\n\u2022 No payment for 66 and more office visits.\n\nRead more from the The Province\n\n\u00a9 Copyright Times Colonist", "article_metadata": {"description": "A University of B.C. professor who studies public health is himself having trouble finding a family doctor.   \u201cI\u2019m actually in the camp of not being able to find a GP,\u201d said Jason Sutherland, a . . .", "title": "Long wait for a family doctor for thousands of British Columbians", "og": {"site_name": "Times Colonist", "description": "A University of B.C. professor who studies public health is himself having trouble finding a family doctor.   \u201cI\u2019m actually in the camp of not being able to find a GP,\u201d said Jason Sutherland, a . . .", "title": "Long wait for a family doctor for thousands of British Columbians", "url": "http://www.timescolonist.com/news/local/long-wait-for-a-family-doctor-for-thousands-of-british-columbians-1.1814577", "image": "http://images.glaciermedia.ca/polopoly_fs/1.1814580.1428272792!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/facebookogimage_560_292/family-doctor-04052015.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://images.glaciermedia.ca/polopoly_fs/1.1814580.1428272792!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/facebookogimage_560_292/family-doctor-04052015.jpg", "description": "A University of B.C. professor who studies public health is himself having trouble finding a family doctor.   \u201cI\u2019m actually in the camp of not being able to find a GP,\u201d said Jason Sutherland, a . . .", "site": "@timescolonist", "card": "summary", "title": "Long wait for a family doctor for thousands of British Columbians"}, "author": "Glen Schaefer", "robots": "NOODP", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "fb": {"app_id": 589634334411994}, "msvalidate.01": "B35552358D0685310DF5A3DE206352FA", "MobileOptimized": 320, "DC.creator": "Glen Schaefer", "keywords": "victoria, local news, capital regional, vancouver island, news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/timescolonist", "section": "News"}, "DC.title": "Long wait for a family doctor for thousands of British Columbians", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "victoria, local news, capital regional, vancouver island, news"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc24a\"", "article_summary": "Medical Association) estimates that some 220,000 British Columbians don\u2019t have a family doctor, up from 176,000 in 2005.\nStill haven\u2019t been able to find one.\u201dBird worries what will happen when her family doctor of 40 years retires.\n\u2022 The usual fee for an in-office visit to a family doctor for a patient between the ages of two and 49 is $30.15.\n\u201cI did look (for a family doctor), and the only openings were more over toward Boundary Road (in Burnaby), quite a ways away,\u201d he said.\nLouise Setchell, with her son Mateo, has been looking for a family doctor since moving to Metro Vancouver in 2009."}
