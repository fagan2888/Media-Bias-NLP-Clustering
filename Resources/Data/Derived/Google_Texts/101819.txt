More than 11 million people signed up or renewed for health insurance on the state and federal exchanges this year, the White House announced Tuesday.

More than a million people signed up in the last nine days of open enrollment, which ended Sunday, the White House said.

"It's working a little better than we anticipated," President Barack Obama said in video posted on Facebook.

"Sunday, February 15 was the biggest enrollment day ever: more new consumers signed up for health coverage than on any day this open enrollment period or the last," the White House said.

Health officials say another 10 million gained health insurance in the states that expanded Medicaid.

Most Americans get health insurance through an employer, Medicare or Medicaid. The exchanges were set up to allow otherwise uncovered people to buy private health insurance, many with hefty federal subsidies.
