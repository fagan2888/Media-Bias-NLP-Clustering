At this point, Ashley Manus, a quick-thinking nurse stepped in and proposed that the cries of her newborn daughter, Rylan, may be enough to rouse Shelly from her sleep. \u201cI was hoping somewhere deep down, Shelly was still there and could feel her baby, hear her baby, and her mother's instincts would come out and she would realize, 'This is where I need to be.'\" Manus told People.\n\nWithin minutes of hearing her baby\u2019s cries, Shelly\u2019s vitals peaked and she woke up long enough to hold Rylan for the first time. However, it still was another week before Shelly made a full recovery from her coma.\n\n\u201cMy life, that i\u2019m still here because of her, and I can\u2019t wait to tell her that, to tell her that she saved my life,\u201d Shelly told Fox 4 Kansas City.\n\nThe North Carolina mom\u2019s reaction to her baby\u2019s cries adds further evidence to the idea that coma patients can hear their loved ones while asleep. Past research has shown that reading stories to coma patients may even help to stimulate the areas of their brain responsible for long-term memory and may help trigger awareness.\n\nNow, a year after the ordeal, the Cawley\u2019s are not only celebrating Rylan\u2019s birthday but also the anniversary of her mother\u2019s recovery.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "mothers, love, mom, awakes, coma, after, hearing, her, newborn, cry, first, time", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Following an emergency C-section, Shelly Cawley did not wake up for hours until she heard the cries of her newborn daughter.", "title": "Mom Awakes From Coma After Hearing Her Newborn Cry [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/mothers-love-mom-awakes-coma-after-hearing-her-newborn-cry-first-time-352460", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured/public/2015/09/14/cawley.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Following an emergency C-section, Shelly Cawley did not wake up for hours until she heard the cries of her newborn daughter.", "title": "Mom Awakes From Coma After Hearing Her Newborn Cry [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/mothers-love-mom-awakes-coma-after-hearing-her-newborn-cry-first-time-352460", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured/public/2015/09/14/cawley.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/09/14/cawley.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-09-14T14:15:13-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-14T14:15:13-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Following an emergency C-section, Shelly Cawley did not wake up for hours until she heard the cries of her newborn daughter."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0fa1\"", "article_summary": "Now, a year after the ordeal, the Cawley\u2019s are not only celebrating Rylan\u2019s birthday but also the anniversary of her mother\u2019s recovery.\nWithin minutes of hearing her baby\u2019s cries, Shelly\u2019s vitals peaked and she woke up long enough to hold Rylan for the first time.\nLast year, in the ultimate example of a mother\u2019s instinct, 23-year-old Shelly Cawley was roused from her medically induced coma after hearing the cries of her newborn daughter for the first time.\n\"The doctors had done all they could and it was clear, they absolutely thought they were losing her at this point,\" Shelly\u2019s husband, Jeremy Cawley told People.\nHowever, it still was another week before Shelly made a full recovery from her coma."}
