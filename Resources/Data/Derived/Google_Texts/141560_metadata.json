Bill Haslam speaks to reporters in an office suite at the state Capitol in Nashville, on Wednesday, Feb. 4. 2015, after the GOP-controlled Legislature defeated his Insure Tennessee proposal to extend health coverage to 280,000 low-income Tennesseans. (AP Photo/Erik Schelzig)\n\nA plan to expand Medicaid to cover an additional 280,000 low-income Tennessee residents failed in a key committee vote Wednesday, bringing a quick end to a long debate spearheaded by Gov. Bill Haslam (R).\n\nAfter nearly two years of negotiations, Haslam called the legislature into special session to consider the plan, dubbed Insure Tennessee. The plan would have offered vouchers to those earning up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level to help purchase employer coverage. Others would have been able to sign up for plans similar to health reimbursement accounts.\n\nHaslam began discussions with Republican lawmakers reluctant to take federal money back in 2013. He announced his support for the modified plan, which he said had tentative approval from the federal Department of Health and Human Services, after winning reelection in 2014. And in recent weeks, he stumped across the state to build public support.\n\nBut after all that work, it took just over two days for the state Senate Health and Welfare Committee to vote, by a 7 to 4 margin, against Insure Tennessee.\n\n\u201cWe made a decision today but we didn\u2019t do anything about, to answer the problem. And the problem is there are hundreds of thousands of Tennesseans who need health care, who could get that in a way that doesn\u2019t cost the state anything,\u201d Haslam said after the vote. \u201cWe have health-care costs that are out of control both in our state and across the country.\u201d\n\nEven if the Senate panel had voted to expand Medicaid, the plan\u2019s path was full of landmines. House Speaker Beth Harwell (R) said earlier Wednesday she didn\u2019t think Insure Tennessee could pass the full House, and its passage through the House Insurance and Banking Committee was far from assured. Even some Democrats voiced skepticism of the expansion.\n\nState Sen. Rusty Crowe (R) told The Tennessean he was concerned about a lack of a signed agreement between state and federal officials.\n\nLegislative leaders don\u2019t expect the Medicaid expansion proposal to return during the regular session, which begins Monday.\n\n\u201cI said from the very beginning it would be difficult to get something that we could get agreed to in Washington, that we could get passed here. And I think what you saw today is a measure of just how difficult that is,\u201d Haslam said.\n\nHaslam was one of a handful of Republican governors who were pushing to accept federal money to expand Medicaid. Governors in Wyoming, Utah and North Carolina are all working with skeptical lawmakers to pass their own plans, though all are fashioning their plans as alternatives to traditional Medicaid expansion. Indiana Gov. Mike Pence (R) announced an agreement with HHS to expand Medicaid last month.\n\nTwenty-eight states and the District of Columbia have expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, including eight states that did so under Republican governors.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Lawmakers killed Gov.
