The shutdown solution Rep. Paul Ryan proposed in a Wall Street Journal op-ed never gained traction.

President Obama's no-negotiation position on raising the debt limit was unpopular, but tying the funding of the government to Obamacare was even less popular, John writes.

Dave Weigel says Republicans are already rewriting the history of their own defeat.

In his remarks after the deal was done, Obama called for an end to the demonization of government.

Facebook loosened its privacy rules for teenagers so it could make more money, Emily writes.

Emily chatters about an endearing Red Sox video on Intentional Talk.

John chatters about a Kottke article on brain training games.

David chatters about a graphic adaptation of the Gettysburg Address.
