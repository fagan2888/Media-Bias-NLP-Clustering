The folly that is Obamacare is beginning to hit Americans hard. Higher premiums, higher deductibles and less choice are all symptoms of the Obamacare disease. Already conceded by even Obamacare’s most shrill apologists are the realities that Americans can’t keep their doctors or their plans or that they’ll save $2,500 dollars a year for a family of four. We are now graduating into government-imposed fines for people who don’t follow their government’s edict to buy lousy and expensive insurance. Now, Americans watch as the huge bureaucracy that has already grown around Obamacare gives out wrong information and places the burdens of compliance on a majority of the people who opposed the wrong-headed bill to begin with.

In short, Americans have been screwed by their own government.

The question is, how do we fight back? The opposition party, you say? There seems to be no opposition party on this issue. Many of the GOP elites, with their $12,000 health care stipend in hand, seem powerless or unwilling to fight this cancerous entitlement.

This weekend on The Chris Salcedo Show, we brought together a panel to answer the question that many who have been harmed by Obamacare are asking: How do Americans beat Obamacare? We also talked with a congressman who said Congress has no constitutional obligation or obligation under the law to fund Barack Obama’s executive inaction memo.
