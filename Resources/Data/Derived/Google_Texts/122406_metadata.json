And that\u2019s largely because it usually makes sense only for a subset of retirement savers, namely, small business owners and self-employed people with non-W-2 income.\n\nFor the right candidates, though, there\u2019s a powerful case to make for SEP IRAs, as long as you understand the fine print.\n\nWhat I Tell Them\n\nThe advantages of the SEP IRA are strong. For starters, it lets you set aside up to 25% of your income (up to $53,000) annually. Traditional IRAs, in comparison, limit you to $5,500 to $6,500, and 401(k)s cap at $18,000 to $24,000.\n\nThe contributions come out of your pretax income, and you don\u2019t pay income taxes on the money until you begin to withdraw it after age 59\u00bd.\n\nAnother giant plus, particularly if you\u2019re prone to upward and downward income swings, is that there are no required annual contributions. That means if you\u2019re having a bad year, you can choose to set aside $0 in the SEP\u2014and then pick it back up once the cash starts flowing in steadily again.\n\nAdministrative costs for SEP IRAs tend to be much lower than those of traditional employee retirement plans. If you own a business, you\u2019d likely have your CPA handle filling out the necessary 5305-SEP IRS form and other paperwork; no third-party administrator is needed.\n\nRelated: IRAs: Everything You Need to Know for 2015\n\nBut the drawbacks of SEP IRAs can be equally striking. First and foremost, if you\u2019re an employer, contributions for workers come out of your own pocket\u2014not theirs. Employees can\u2019t contribute their money to SEP IRAs, so it\u2019s essentially your gift.\n\nFor small business owners, the SEP has one contribution rule that\u2019s particularly rigid: You have to contribute the same percentage for each employee\u2014you can\u2019t kick in 10% for a new hire while rewarding a longtime worker with 25%.\n\nEven if you\u2019re a freelancer or sole proprietor and only contribute for yourself, you need to rake in serious revenue to take full advantage of the 25% max contribution. Few people can afford to save $1 out of every $4 they earn. For this reason, it\u2019s usually those who make more than $200,000 a year who gravitate toward a SEP.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nA SEP IRA tends to cater to individuals who are self-employed or run a small business. It\u2019s an especially attractive retirement savings option for high earners who have cash left over after paying their bills and can put aside a significant amount of pretax income.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Retirement can conjure up visions of perfecting your golf swing, hanging with the gran", "title": "How the Self-Employed Can Build Big Retirement Nest Eggs", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/30/How-Self-Employed-Can-Build-Big-Retirement-Nest-Eggs", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/09302012_retirement_piggies_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/30/How-Self-Employed-Can-Build-Big-Retirement-Nest-Eggs", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/09302012_retirement_piggies_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Retirement can conjure up visions of perfecting your golf swing, hanging with the gran", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3dd9\"", "article_summary": "The Bottom LineA SEP IRA tends to cater to individuals who are self-employed or run a small business.\nThat\u2019s why I sometimes get asked: \u201cWhat\u2019s a SEP IRA?\u201dWhy So Many People Ask This QuestionThe SEP IRA isn\u2019t a well-known entity.\nRelated: IRAs: Everything You Need to Know for 2015But the drawbacks of SEP IRAs can be equally striking.\nFor the right candidates, though, there\u2019s a powerful case to make for SEP IRAs, as long as you understand the fine print.\nAnd that\u2019s largely because it usually makes sense only for a subset of retirement savers, namely, small business owners and self-employed people with non-W-2 income."}
