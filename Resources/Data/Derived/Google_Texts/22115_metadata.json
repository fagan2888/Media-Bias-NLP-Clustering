Five rural medical centers have closed since 2013 and nearly two thirds of the rest were in the red in 2014. Hospital executives have tried just about everything to right their respective ships: Fort Oglethorpe\u2019s hospital restructured; Elijay\u2019s cut services; and Sandersville\u2019s went so far as to hand over the keys to the owner of the local Ford dealership. (Spoiler: It wasn\u2019t a good test drive.)\n\nFor Georgia, what\u2019s already become a major problem could worsen. At the end of 2017, the state will reach the edge of a fiscal cliff that could shutter small rural hospitals\u2014as well as force larger urban hospitals to close key clinics. The problem has spurred hospital officials, state lawmakers, and health-care advocates to form a statewide alliance to resolve the potential funding gap before it\u2019s too late.\n\nThe situation in which Georgia finds itself was brought about by an unintended consequence of legal challenges to the Affordable Care Act. For years, many Georgia hospitals relied on federal reimbursements\u2014known as Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) payments\u2014to offset the cost of treating the uninsured. But the ACA called for those payments to be phased out under the assumption that those patients would now have insurance.\n\nHowever, things didn\u2019t go according to plan. In 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a key provision of the ACA that required states to expand Medicaid. Like many Republican governors, Nathan Deal rejected the expansion, claiming it would cost Georgia too much. (If the governor expanded Medicaid, the state would have had to spend $2.5 billion over a 10-year period, but would\u2019ve received $33.7 billion in federal cash.) As a result, the state still has more than 400,000 uninsured residents.\n\nWith federal DSH payments scheduled to end January 1, 2018, more of Georgia\u2019s rural hospitals could be forced out of business if the state still hasn\u2019t expanded Medicaid to cover currently uninsured patients. For many small communities, Hometown Health CEO Jimmy Lewis says, such closures could mean driving more than an hour to reach an emergency room.\n\n\u201cA very large part of the rural hospital population is losing money and is financially distressed,\u201d Lewis says. \u201cThe loss of DSH in Georgia won\u2019t be a good thing.\u201d\n\nLarge safety-net hospitals like Grady Memorial Hospital and Savannah Memorial Hospital, which are required to care for indigent patients regardless of their ability to pay, could also be harmed. If DSH payments disappear, hospital officials could be forced to consider closing entire departments. Grady CEO John Haupert, who helped restore the hospital\u2019s fiscal health after it faced closure in the mid-2000s, has said the hospital\u2019s mental health clinic\u2014the state\u2019s second largest after the prison system\u2014could be on the chopping block if it is unable to offset the loss of DSH payments.\n\nTim Sweeney, deputy director of policy for the Georgia Budget and Policy Institute, says the easiest way forward is to fix the problem by expanding Medicaid as intended. \u201cThe sooner Georgia acts, the better off it\u2019ll be,\u201d Sweeney says. \u201cIt addresses the coverage issue and it brings $3 billion into state\u2019s healthcare system. If hospitals weren\u2019t getting paid to deliver care, this would pay them. In the long term, it\u2019s delivering care in lower cost settings than hospitals.\u201d\n\nHowever, the divisive politics surrounding Obamacare make a straightforward expansion of Medicaid virtually impossible. Two years ago, Deal, who once had sole authority to expand the federal program, signed a bill that passed the buck to the General Assembly. By giving a larger group of Obamacare opponents a voice in the matter, he made it even harder to expand Medicaid.\n\nSo how do you effectively expand Medicaid without calling it Medicaid expansion? The influential Georgia Chamber has hired two old Deal staffers, former spokesperson Brian Robinson and ex-health policy adviser Blake Fulenwider, to work on a Georgia solution. Their pitch: It\u2019s in the state\u2019s best interest to expand healthcare access.\n\n\u201cThis affects businesses and individuals,\u201d Robinson says. \u201cIf a hospital closes and it\u2019s a lot farther to get treated for a stroke, it\u2019s significantly harder to attract major economic developments for those regions. Employees don\u2019t want to go where they can\u2019t get health care.\u201d\n\nRobinson, who until last year had peddled anti-Obamacare rhetoric for the governor, seems an unlikely candidate for the gig. But he envisions a broad coalition coming together to solve the DSH dilemma\u2014much in the same way both parties rallied behind Deal\u2019s criminal justice reform efforts during his first term.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll depend on buy-in from every region, Democrat and Republican,\u201d Robinson says. \u201cIt can\u2019t be politicized.\u201d\n\nSince last fall, the Georgia Chamber has also looked at the economic impact of closing the coverage gap and studied Medicaid expansion workarounds that wouldn\u2019t hurt the state\u2019s bottom line. The group expects to make a series of formal recommendations later this year. Once they pick one of those plans, supporters plan to build momentum around it heading into next year\u2019s legislative session. By that time, the nation will have elected a new president, and the polarizing debate around healthcare likely will have calmed down. That leaves a yearlong window to stop hospitals from falling off a fiscal cliff.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t have a plan in place, we don\u2019t know the full extent of the DSH cuts,\u201d Robinson says. \u201cThis gets us ready for any potential situation.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.categories": "News & Opinion,", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.atlantamagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2016/02/Hutcheson-005-cropped-300x300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "Max Blau", "description": "Rural and urban hospitals form an unlikely alliance to find an alternative to Medicaid expansion", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "sailthru.link": "http://www.atlantamagazine.com/news-culture-articles/georgias-hospitals-look-to-avoid-financial-catastrophe/", "og": {"site_name": "Atlanta Magazine", "description": "Rural and urban hospitals form an unlikely alliance to find an alternative to Medicaid expansion", "title": "Georgia\u2019s hospitals look to avoid financial catastrophe - Atlanta Magazine", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1000, "identifier": "http://www.atlantamagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2016/02/Hutcheson-005-cropped-e1455732695139.jpg", "height": 510}, "updated_time": "2016-02-17T14:54:35-04:00", "url": "http://www.atlantamagazine.com/news-culture-articles/georgias-hospitals-look-to-avoid-financial-catastrophe/", "type": "article"}, "sailthru.image.221": "http://www.atlantamagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2016/02/Hutcheson-005-cropped-221x290.jpg", "sailthru.date": "2016-02-17 13:25:06", "sailthru.image.100": "http://www.atlantamagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2016/02/Hutcheson-005-cropped-100x120.jpg", "robots": "noodp", "sailthru.title": "Georgia\u2019s hospitals look to avoid financial catastrophe", "sailthru.image.400": "http://www.atlantamagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2016/02/Hutcheson-005-cropped-400x400.jpg", "sailthru.tags": "Affordable Care Act,Brian Robinson,Georgia,Georgia Chamber,Jimmy Lewis,Medicaid Expansion,Nathan Deal,Tim Sweeney,News & Opinion,News and Culture,", "article": {"section": "News & Opinion", "tag": "Tim Sweeney", "published_time": "2016-02-17T13:25:06-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-17T14:54:35-04:00", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/maxcblau"}, "news_keywords": "affordable care act, brian robinson, georgia, georgia chamber, jimmy lewis, medicaid expansion, nathan deal, tim sweeney", "sailthru.description": "\"If a hospital closes and it\u2019s a lot farther to get treated for a stroke, it\u2019s significantly harder to attract major economic development[s] for those regions.
