That gave newly-sworn in President George W. Bush his first international crisis to deal with.\n\nOsborn and his crew were interrogated by the Chinese before being released.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re 26 years old, you\u2019re scared out of your mind,\u201d Osborn recalled. \u201cThose twelve days they held us prisoner were very intense. They used sleep deprivation. They interrogated me six to eight hours at a time. They didn\u2019t let me sleep for days on end.\u201d\n\nOsborn said he is often asked about his experience in China while on the campaign trail.\n\n\u201cI say this on the stump, \u2018Listen, I understand you\u2019re probably thinking in your mind what\u2019s being a good Navy pilot have to do with being a good U.S. senator. And my answer is not much. But leadership matters. And, I learned how to lead in the Navy,'\u201d Osborn said.\n\nThe Nebraska Senate primary\n\nOsborn is running in a competitive GOP primary to replace Republican Sen. Mike Johanns this year. His competition includes Republican Ben Sasse, the president of Midland University.\n\nAsked to differentiate himself from his opponents, Osborn noted his military experience. \u201cThere are only two combat veterans in the United States Senate,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve collected intelligence off of every single country we\u2019re having problems with today,\u201d Osborn said. \u201cI won\u2019t just make my decisions based on academic theory. I make them on real-world experience. Personal experience.\u201d\n\nObsorn also emphasizes his business experience. \u201cI\u2019m the only entrepreneur in this race,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m the only one who knows what it\u2019s like to risk all and leave a cushy job and go out there and create a business from scratch.\u201d\n\nHe also boasts of cutting spending as state treasurer. \u201cI\u2019m the only one in this race or probably in any race running right now that can say they\u2019ve actually shrunk government,\u201d he said.\n\nContinuing, he said: \u201cOver a four year period, I cut the budget nearly 12 percent. I reduced the staff 28 percent. \u2026 I actually know how to shrink government and make it more efficient.\u201d\n\nAs state treasurer, Osborn said he launched NebraskaSpending.gov, which shows every aspect of state spending. He said the federal government should do something similar.\n\n\u201cPie graphs, bar graphs, historical data going back ten years and it shows people where they\u2019re money\u2019s being sent,\u201d he said. \u201cWho\u2019s the vendor, who are the vendors doing business with the state? That\u2019s something we absolutely need in Washington, D.C.\u201d\n\nAs for other issues he\u2019s talking about on the trail, Osborn said: \u201cObamacare is obviously a big topic on everybody\u2019s mind. I am the only candidate in this race that back in 2009, I spoke at rallies all across the state hammering on Obamacare, saying this is bad policy.\u201d\n\n\u201cObviously Obamacare is failing miserably, but it was designed to fail. It\u2019s just failing quicker than they thought. And we know the end game here. For the Democrats and Obama it\u2019s to have single payer health care,\u201d he said.\n\nFollow Alex on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Alex Pappas", "description": "Shane Osborn running for Senate on his military experience", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Shane Osborn is the only Senate candidate who can make a campaign pitch like this.    \"If I can stand up to interrogations by the Chinese -- the communist Chinese for twelve days -- I can certainly ha", "title": "Navy pilot famously held captive by Chinese running for Senate", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/02/03/navy-pilot-famously-held-captive-by-chinese-running-for-senate/", "image": {"width": 517, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/shane-osborn-senate-nebraska-e1391486508246.jpg", "height": 222}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Shane Osborn running for Senate on his military experience", "title": "Navy pilot famously held captive by Chinese running for Senate Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/02/03/navy-pilot-famously-held-captive-by-chinese-running-for-senate/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/shane-osborn-senate-nebraska-e1391486508246.jpg"}, "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-02-03 23:08:22", "sailthru.title": "Navy pilot famously held captive by Chinese running for Senate", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "sailthru.tags": "nebraska,alex-pappas", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "keywords": "nebraska", "sailthru.description": "Shane Osborn is the only Senate candidate who can make a campaign pitch like this.    \"If I can stand up to interrogations by the Chinese -- the communist Chinese for twelve days -- I can certainly ha", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/shane-osborn-senate-nebraska-e1391486508246.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf9e2\"", "article_summary": "Osborn, the former Republican State Treasurer in Nebraska, was the Navy pilot held captive for nearly two weeks by the Chinese after the Hainan Island incident in 2001.\nThe Navy plane piloted by Osborn collided in midair with a Chinese fighter jet in international airspace, sending his plane into an inverted dive.\n\u2026 I actually know how to shrink government and make it more efficient.\u201dAs state treasurer, Osborn said he launched NebraskaSpending.gov, which shows every aspect of state spending.\nAnd, I learned how to lead in the Navy,'\u201d Osborn said.\nWhile the Chinese pilot died in the collision, Osborn safely landed the plane in China carrying a 23-member crew."}
