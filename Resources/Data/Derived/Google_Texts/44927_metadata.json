John Kitzhaber announced last week that the Service Employees International Union would drop five ballot measures \u2014 and instead sit down for talks with the state\u2019s biggest health systems: Legacy, Providence, Kaiser and PeaceHealth.\n\nHere\u2019s what those ballot measures might have done and what the various parties are now hoping to get from the talks.\n\nFor anyone who\u2019s wrestled to understand a hospital bill, or find the best local hospital, the ballot measures might have been appealing.\n\nCourtesy Nathan Bobey/SEIU\n\nMeg Niemi is the president of SEIU local 49 , which has thousands of members working in the health care sector. She says one measure would have made it easier to shop for health care.\n\n\u201cSo what would be the difference to get some stitches at a Providence versus a Legacy ER versus a PeaceHealth ER. Actually what\u2019s the difference in cost,\u201d she said.\n\nAnother measure would have dealt with quality.\n\n\u201cSo how do you as a patient or consumer be able to evaluate and say which hospital is going to give me the highest quality of care. I\u2019m going to have the best chance of recovery for this surgery, the best outcomes and right now that data is not available to consumers,\u201d said Niemi.\n\nCourtesy Jesse Stemmler/SEIU\n\nThere is some information available. But it\u2019s difficult to both find and to understand.\n\nAnother ballot measures would have pinned down the amount of charity care hospitals have to provide. Most Oregon hospitals are non-profit, so in exchange for not having to pay various taxes they offer care to those who can\u2019t afford to pay.\n\n\u201cWe think that hospitals should have a base amount of charity care they need to be providing, in return for being non-profit and not paying taxes,\u201d said Niemi. \u201cSo saying that they should provide at least five percent of their level of revenue in charity care to the community.\u201d\n\nAnother measure would have capped executive pay at 15 times that of the lowest paid employee.\n\nAnd the final measure would have capped the price of health care procedures at 130 percent of the actual hospital cost \u2014 so uninsured patients would no longer face inflated costs because they don\u2019t have an insurance company negotiating on their behalf.\n\nBut to avoid a big fight over the measures, Governor John Kitzhaber\u2019s office managed to get the SEIU and the big health care systems to sit down and work on these issues.\n\nDave Underriner is the chair elect of the Oregon Association of Hospitals and Health Systems.\n\n\u201cRather than allowing the process and the engagement to happen, the ballot measures would take a pretty strong blunt implement to the work that\u2019s going on and I think divert away from the work that we need to be doing together,\u201d said Underriner.\n\nKey to the talks will be the degree to which the concerns of union workers, like x-ray technicians, registered nurses and housekeepers, are addressed by hospital executives. This is at a time when hospitals are trying reduce costs \u2014 and maybe cut staff \u2014 to meet new state and federal requirements.\n\nSo for example, the federal government is fining hospitals for having high re-admissions \u2014 that is a high number of cases where a patient is released from hospital after an operation, then quickly returns because of an infection or other problems associated with the original admission.\n\nUnder the old system, hospitals benefited from re-admissions \u2014 because they could charge fees for them. Now under the Affordable Care Act, they\u2019ll be fined.\n\nUnion president Meg Niemi says hospitals could learn a lot from their staff about such issues \u2014 rather than from executives and consultants.\n\n\u201cEven Science Today has done articles about housekeepers having the right training, the right equipment and enough time to clean patients\u2019 rooms in the right way, getting all of the right touch points that are frequently touched in areas where infections get spread, is one of the best ways that you can reduce infection rates,\u201d said Niemi.\n\n\u201cAnd often in a hospital, housekeepers are seen on the lowest rung of the totem poll, rather than respected for that.\u201d\n\nSo the union wants to see more staff given more time to do their jobs.\n\nHospital Association chair elect Dave Underriner, says hospitals already tap cleaners, nurses and technicians for information and ideas.\n\n\u201cOne of the most important things that we do is engage our caregivers, our employees, our front line staff in the work that we do,\u201d said Underriner.\n\nBut, he says, they\u2019re always open to more.\n\n\u201cWere going into the meetings with the full team of folks, including SEIU to really engage in dialogue around how are we improving health care, what are some of the best practices that we\u2019ve seen in Oregon, around the country. So I think this collective meeting is an opportunity to engage in that dialogue with typically a group of folks that you won\u2019t necessarily see around a table.\u201d\n\nGovernor Kitzhaber issued a statement saying the agreement moves health reform goals forward far better than a multimillion dollar ballot measure fight.\n\nThe first meeting has yet to be scheduled, but discussions are likely to last through the summer.\n\nThe union hasn\u2019t gathered the signatures to put the measures on the ballot, but it says if these talks aren\u2019t productive, it would pursue them in 2016.", "article_metadata": {"author": "Kristian Foden-Vencil", "og": {"url": "http://www.opb.org/news/series/vitalsigns/multi-million-dollar-ballot-fight-avoided/", "image": "http://www.opb.org/images/upload/c_fill,h_300,q_90,w_400/f8bljjbdnigu10vy77cw.jpg", "description": "Oregon may have just avoided a multimillion dollar health care battle.", "title": "Multi-Million Dollar Ballot Fight Avoided"}, "twitter": {"description": "<p>Oregon may have just avoided a multimillion dollar health care battle.</p>", "title": "Multimillion Dollar Ballot Fight Avoided?", "image": {"src": "http://www.opb.org/images/upload/c_fill,h_348,q_90,w_620/f8bljjbdnigu10vy77cw.jpg"}, "creator": "@OPB", "site": "@OPB", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "org_id": "OPB", "fb": {"pages": 17790154938}, "google-site-verification": "KMaJ_LFRGDv_xknYuKImf3uF3H8gkUuIblN-HIVIjAM", "sniply-options": "block", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb6ea\"", "article_summary": "Oregon may have just avoided a multimillion dollar health care battle.\nHere\u2019s what those ballot measures might have done and what the various parties are now hoping to get from the talks.\nFor anyone who\u2019s wrestled to understand a hospital bill, or find the best local hospital, the ballot measures might have been appealing.\nAnother ballot measures would have pinned down the amount of charity care hospitals have to provide.\nCourtesy Nathan Bobey/SEIUMeg Niemi is the president of SEIU local 49 , which has thousands of members working in the health care sector."}
