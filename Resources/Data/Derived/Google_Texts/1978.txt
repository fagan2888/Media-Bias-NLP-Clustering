Downtown Meridian has been busy with several activities at the Threefoot Arts Festival Saturday.

It was clear skies and perfect temperatures for the annual event. Hundreds of people turned out to enjoy arts, crafts, live music and of course a lot of good food. Many people coming out to enjoy the music and fellowship others just to see what some of the vendors have to offer.

"You can come out here and see everything. It's pretty cool, honestly,” Robert Anderson says.

"It's fun stuff, I love it," Derrick Clark says.

“People have been supporting and buying. It's great weather, but a little windy. It's a great atmosphere and everyone is enjoying it," Kenneth Rue says.
