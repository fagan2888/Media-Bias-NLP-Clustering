Supporters for Texas gubernatorial candidate Wendy Davis were caught on video mocking her Republican opponent, Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott, over the fact that he’s confined to a wheelchair.

When James O’Keefe’s “Project Veritas” was in Texas to investigate Obamacare navigators and Battleground Texas, a group organized to turn red state Texas blue, it found something else altogether.

“Since he’s in a wheelchair and most the slogans are ‘Stand with Wendy’ and ‘Stand with Texas Women,’ isn’t that amazing to think of? He’s in a wheelchair and we want to stand with Wendy?” a supporter said.

She then remarks on Abbott’s shortcomings as a candidate for statewide office.

“Greg Abbott is not, he’s really not a sure thing, and he’s really not real electable,” the Battleground Texas staffer says. “First of all he’s not good looking, he doesn’t speak very well, he doesn’t have a good personality, and he’s in a wheelchair.” This observation resulted in cackles of laughter.

What she neglected to add is that Abbott, as attorney general, has already won statewide office. His opponent, as a state senator, has not.

Davis, who’s already under fire for embellishing her biography, wasn’t happy when she heard of this latest development. O’Keefe tweeted:

Breaking: Wendy Davis Responds to video: "The language used in this video about Greg Abbott is abhorrent…." — James O'Keefe (@JamesOKeefeIII) January 23, 2014

Abhorrent? Yes — and it also isn’t going to help her already beleaguered campaign.
