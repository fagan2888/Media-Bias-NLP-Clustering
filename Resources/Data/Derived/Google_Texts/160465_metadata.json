Now that he\u2019s a presidential candidate, fact-checkers are examining his rhetorical record.\n\nHow Uber knows your phone battery is dying and more\n\nWhy Congress is looking at labels to curb food waste\n\nSmoke detected on EgyptAir Flight 804: What does that mean?\n\nBillionaire developer and reality TV personality Donald Trump has been getting the cold-shoulder treatment from the Republican establishment, especially most of the other presidential hopefuls, for his controversial remarks about immigration.\n\nBut the veracity of his assertions \u2013 not just on immigration but on a wide range of issues \u2013 is being tested by fact-checkers as well.\n\nIn a blistering op-ed piece about the reemergence of anti-immigration thought similar to the Know Nothing movement of the 19th century, Timothy Egan of The New York Times takes on Trump and conservative political commentator Ann Coulter, whose latest book is titled \u201c\u00a1Adios, America! The Left\u2019s Plan to Turn Our Country Into a Third World Hellhole.\u201d\n\nRecommended: What do you know about Donald Trump?\n\nEgan points to a Pew Research Center report concluding that \u201cthe net migration flow from Mexico to the United States has stopped and may have reversed.\u201d\n\nAccording to Pew, \u201cThe standstill appears to be the result of many factors, including the weakened U.S. job and housing construction markets, heightened border enforcement, a rise in deportations, the growing dangers associated with illegal border crossings, the long-term decline in Mexico\u2019s birth rates and broader economic conditions in Mexico.\u201d\n\nEgan also cites National Bureau of Economic Research data showing that \u201cpoor immigrants are less likely to take advantage of free government help than citizens.\u201d\n\nAs for Trump\u2019s controversial remark about many Mexican immigrants being violent criminals, including \u201crapists,\u201d that too is questionable. (\u201cThey\u2019re bringing drugs,\u201d Trump said in announcing his presidential bid last month. \u201cThey\u2019re bringing crime. They\u2019re rapists.\u201d)\n\n\u201cThe Congressional Research Service found that the vast majority of unauthorized immigrants do not fit in the category that fits Trump\u2019s description: aggravated felons, whose crimes include murder, drug trafficking or illegal trafficking of firearms,\u201d The Washington Post reports. \u201cCRS also found that non-citizens make up a smaller percentage of the inmate population in state prisons and jails, compared to their percentage to the total U.S. population.\u201d\n\nBased on an analysis of data from the FBI, the US Census Bureau, and other agencies, the American Immigration Council reports:\n\n\u201cA variety of different studies using different methodologies have found that immigrants are less likely than the native-born to engage in either violent or nonviolent \u2018antisocial\u2019 behaviors; that immigrants are less likely than the native-born to be repeat offenders among \u2018high risk\u2019 adolescents; and that immigrant youth who were students in U.S. middle and high schools in the mid-1990s and are now young adults have among the lowest delinquency rates of all young people.\u201d\n\nWhile Trump\u2019s incendiary comments about immigrants have gotten the most attention, his rhetorical forays into military policy and national security have triggered pushback as well.\n\nIn order to defeat ISIS, Trump says he would \u201cbomb the hell\u201d out of oil fields in Iraq.\n\n\"If I win [the presidential election], I would attack those oil sites that are controlled and owned \u2013 they are controlled by ISIS,\" Trump said. \"I wouldn't send many troops because you won't need 'em by the time I'm done.\"\n\nMilitary experts say that would do more harm than good, CNN reports, because it would make it more difficult for Iraq to rebuild once ISIS is defeated.\n\n\"You're destroying the infrastructure of Iraq, you're not really doing much to hurt ISIS,\" retired Lt. Col. Rick Francona said. \"At some future point those oil fields will have to help regenerate Iraq.\"\n\n\"You have to understand the issues a little bit better than just bombing things,\" says Lt. Gen. Mark Hertling, another CNN military analyst.\n\nCynics may believe that \u201ctruth in politics\u201d can never be firmly established. But a number of institutions and organizations give it a try, including Pulitzer Prize winner PolitiFact, an independent fact-checking journalism website. Here\u2019s how they grade 23 of Donald Trump\u2019s statements: Two are true; three are half true; two are mostly false; ten are false; and six are \u201cpants on fire.\u201d\n\nAmong the Trump statements rated false are those having to do with public approval rates on abortion, the US unemployment rate, the enrollment rate for the Affordable Care Act, the amount President Obama has spent defending lawsuits regarding his birth certificate, the reliability of the US nuclear arsenal, whether South Korea pays for US troops based there, who buys Libyan oil, and the fact that his book \u201cThe Art of the Deal\u201d is \u201cthe number one selling business book of all time.\u201d\n\nPolitiFact also debunks several Trump statements on immigration.\n\nFor his questionable and downright false assertions about immigration, the Post\u2019s fact-checker feature awards Trump \u201cFour Pinocchios,\u201d defined as \u201cWhoppers.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s repeated statements about immigrants and crime underscore a common public perception that crime is correlated with immigration, especially illegal immigration,\u201d writes the Post\u2019s Michelle Ye Hee Lee. \u201cBut that is a misperception; no solid data support it, and the data that do exist negate it. Trump can defend himself all he wants, but the facts just are not there.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, most Republicans are distancing themselves as rapidly as possible from Trump\u2019s comments on immigration.\n\nOn Saturday, Trump is scheduled to speak to an event at the Phoenix Convention Center hosted by the Republican Party of Maricopa County and featuring Sheriff Joe Arpaio, another outspoken opponent of most immigration.\n\nUS Sens. John McCain and Jeff Flake and Gov. Doug Ducey, all Republicans, are shunning the event, reports The Arizona Republic.\n\n\"Donald Trump's views are coarse, ill-informed and inaccurate, and they are not representative of the Republican Party,\" said Sen. Flake.\"As an elected Republican official, I'm disappointed the county party would host a speaker that so damages the party's image.\"\n\nIn addition to the media sniping and fact-checking watchdogs, Trump has seen some of his many business ties broken as a result of his comments on immigration. Does he care about any of this? Apparently not.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.content.id": "a0b950d75fa1c0e613dfb16b0fd26bbb", "sailthru.author": "Brad Knickerbocker", "description": "Billionaire developer and TV personality Donald Trump is known for generating outrage when commenting on just about anything, most recently immigration.
