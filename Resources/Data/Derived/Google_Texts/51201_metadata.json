The Obama administration has a new metaphor for the rollout of the health law: It\u2019ll be like the iPhone upgrade.\n\n\u201cI clearly have an iPad, and I also have an iPhone, and about ten days ago got the prompt that the operating system had changed and did I want to upgrade to the new operating system, and so I did, on both my iPad and my iPhone,\u201d said HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius hours before the new insurance exchanges went live, building on a metaphor tested late last week by one of her top deputies, Gary Cohen, and then other senior administration officials in briefings with reporters.\n\nPrescribed: An Interactive WSJ Tour of What Obamacare Means for You\n\n\u201cAnd then about five days after that, I got the second prompt saying, \u2018Well, there\u2019s a little problem with the iOS 7 system and now we have a \u2018new\u2019 new upgrade and why don\u2019t you re-upgrade your upgrade,\u2019\u201d the secretary said.\n\nOK, we think we know where this is going.\n\n\u201cApple, you know, has a few more resources than we have to roll out technology, and a few more people who\u2019ve been working on the system for a while, and no-one is calling on Apple to not sell devices for a year or to, you know, get out of the business because the whole thing is a failure.\u201d\n\nWait \u2014 the federal government is comparing itself to Apple?\n\n\u201cEveryone just assumes \u2018Well, there\u2019s a problem, they\u2019ll fix it, we\u2019ll move on,\u2019 said Ms. Sebelius. \u201cAnd like many of their customers I put the \u2018new\u2019 new system on my phone and went on my merry way, but it was just a reminder that we\u2019re likely to have some glitches. We will fix them and move on. Is this a sign that the law is flawed and failed? I don\u2019t think so. I think it\u2019s a sign that we\u2019re building a piece of complicated technology, we want it to work, we want it to work right. We\u2019ve got an incredible team working 24/7 to do just that.\u201d\n\n\u201cHopefully they\u2019ll give us the same slack they give Apple,\u201d she finished up. \u201cIf there\u2019s not quite the operational excellence right away, we\u2019ll continue to press for that.\u201d\n\nThere are limits, though. When a reporter pointed out to Ms. Sebelius that Apple has had tech rollouts that started too soon, and asked her to identify the point at which the administration would consider backing away, the secretary responded less enthusiastically.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t possibly do that. I don\u2019t know. We haven\u2019t gone through 85,000 DEFCON scenarios. I can tell you that we have anticipated a variety of ways that people can enter the system, a variety of ways that we can get people enrolled, and that we have backups and redundancies for most of the systems in place.\n\n\u201cHaving said that, we\u2019re focused on going forward and recognizing that frankly, this is a brand new launch, a brand new opportunity, and for a lot of people, I think the biggest challenge is getting them information about what really is out there.\u201d\n\nMore", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Forget glitches and bumps.
