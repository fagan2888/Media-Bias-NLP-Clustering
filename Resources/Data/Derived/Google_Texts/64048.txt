Cool ranch Doritos: Just the sound of it evokes the sensation of blissful taste and crunch that sends my mouth watering. But have you ever wondered what’s actually in them? Well, photographer Dwight Eschliman and author Steve Ettlinger are offering a new approach to how we view the processed foods we eat, that’ll make you seriously rethink your next Insta-food post.

Their book, Ingredients: A Visual Exploration of 75 Additives and 25 Food Products, set to come out Sept. 29, offers a visual representation of all the ingredients and additives put in common processed foods we all enjoy. Taking the trend of stunning, photoshopped pictures of our favorite edibles, the book breaks down these treats, and gives a fascinating look at some of their most basic components. Ettlinger and Eschliman take us through what those unpronounceable words on our food labels actually look like, further adding to the discourse of why less artificial ingredients should go in our food. Because there’s just nothing yummier than ethyl vanillin, shellac, and cooked chicken skins.
