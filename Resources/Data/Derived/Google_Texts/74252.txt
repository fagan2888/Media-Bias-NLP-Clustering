Orlando's Planned Parenthood has merged with affiliates in Naples and Sarasota, creating Planned Parenthood of Southwest and Central Florida.

"That geographic expansion allows us to provide greater access to health care organizations regionally," said Barbara Zdravecky, the new organization's CEO, which has its headquarters in Sarasota. "We're more attractive as a merged entity, for sure."

Patient services at the 12 health centers serving 22 counties, reaching from Brevard County to Citrus and Collier, will not be affected.

The merger follows the current trend among other health-care groups, hospitals and practices, which are looking for ways to maintain a positive bottom line in the changing and complex health-care landscape.

With the Affordable Care Act, Planned Parenthood began accepting third-party insurance, which helped patients who had been paying cash.

But, it also meant that the organization had to hire staff to do billing, coding and contract negotiations. "We have over 25 insurance contracts that we're now dealing with, whereas two years ago we had none," Zdravecky said.

Other factors driving the merger, which was unanimously approved by their boards, were the cost of electronic health records, maintaining the ability to offer competitive salaries and to boost lobbying efforts.

"We'll be looking at advocating in a stronger way in Tallahassee so that we can have our voices heard," Zdravecky said.

Among the top issues for the agency is the 24-hour waiting period for abortions, a new law approved by the Legislature but temporarily delayed by a judge last week.

"We know that the state mandate puts women's health at risk, and we fought against it when it was introduced in Tallahassee, and we continue to support the ACLU's challenge to it," she said.

The new organization will serve 39,000 patients, with more than 60,000 annual visits.
