Judicial Watch added that arrests for murders are up 55 percent, while rape arrests have surged 370 percent:\n\nJudicial Watch announced today it obtained records from the San Francisco County Sheriff\u2019s Department revealing that violent crime in the Bay area has skyrocketed since 2011, with the number of arrests for murder up 55%, and the number of arrests for rapes up 370%. Judicial Watch uncovered the numbers through a July 9, 2015, California Public Records Act request that sought the number of arrests for violations of the following crimes between 2011 and 2015: Penal Code 187 \u2013 first and second degree murder Penal Code 240 \u2013 simply assault Penal Code243 \u2013 battery Penal Code 261 \u2013 rape According to the data provided by the Sheriff\u2019s Department, arrests for violations of the most violent of the crimes listed \u2013 murder and rape \u2013 have soared over the past four years:\n\nJudicial Watch President said in a statement that this data shows a connection between sanctuary status and crime. Illegal aliens enter these urban areas because they know there won\u2019t be a concerted federal effort to find them and deport them. You can debate about whether there is a correlation between sanctuary cities and illegal aliens. While there has been a spike in homicides in most urban areas across the country, they haven\u2019t come close to the insane homicides rates that were set in the 1990s. Moreover, FiveThirtyEight found that media headlines might have contributed to this aura that the country is undergoing a renewed crime wave; we\u2019re still less violent, and much safer, than we were 20 years ago.\n\nNevertheless, it doesn\u2019t mitigate the awful murders illegal aliens have committed over the years. The most recent to grab national headlines, and rightfully so, was the horrific death of Kate Steinle, who was shot in San Francisco by an illegal alien.\n\nHer killer, Francisco Sanchez, had been deported five times, but admitted upon his arrest that he continued to come to San Francisco due to its status as a sanctuary city. Sanchez said he was under the influence of pills, and that shooting Steinle was an \u201caccident.\u201d\n\nSteinle was walking on a pier when she died, her last words to her father were, \u201chelp me, Dad.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Not good.05/25/2016 23:31:57PM EST.", "author": "Matt Vespa", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Not good", "title": "Matt Vespa - San Francisco Sees Spikes In Murder and Sexual Assault Arrests", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2015/09/14/san-francisco-sees-spikes-in-murder-and-sexual-assault-arrests-n2051894", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/240/f834932c-a18b-4a15-9f6d-b3853f8e5d5f.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Not good", "title": "Matt Vespa - San Francisco Sees Spikes In Murder and Sexual Assault Arrests", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2015/09/14/san-francisco-sees-spikes-in-murder-and-sexual-assault-arrests-n2051894", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/240/f834932c-a18b-4a15-9f6d-b3853f8e5d5f.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "San Francisco Sees Spikes In Murder and Sexual Assault Arrests, Matt Vespa, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd863a\"", "article_summary": "Her killer, Francisco Sanchez, had been deported five times, but admitted upon his arrest that he continued to come to San Francisco due to its status as a sanctuary city.\nThe most recent to grab national headlines, and rightfully so, was the horrific death of Kate Steinle, who was shot in San Francisco by an illegal alien.\nJudicial Watch added that arrests for murders are up 55 percent, while rape arrests have surged 370 percent:Judicial Watch announced today it obtained records from the San Francisco County Sheriff\u2019s Department revealing that violent crime in the Bay area has skyrocketed since 2011, with the number of arrests for murder up 55%, and the number of arrests for rapes up 370%.\nYou can debate about whether there is a correlation between sanctuary cities and illegal aliens.\nIllegal aliens enter these urban areas because they know there won\u2019t be a concerted federal effort to find them and deport them."}
