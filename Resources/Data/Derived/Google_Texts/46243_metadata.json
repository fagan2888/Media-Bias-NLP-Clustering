When that tube gets plugged up, Joe stops breathing, and unclogging it is risky, requiring the skills of specially trained nurses.\n\n\u201cEverything has changed,\u201d Donna Swider, 59, told FoxNews.com. \u201cThis is a man that\u2019s walking, talking, eating, working, driving one day\u2014 and the next, he\u2019s on a ventilator.\u201d\n\nAfter a federal judge ruled in December that Swider\u2019s local union didn\u2019t break the law by switching health insurance plans, the Swiders, of Atco, New Jersey, have begun tapping into donations to pay for the nursing they thought Joe\u2019s 27 years with the union would always cover. Donna, who works full time as a physicians\u2019 recruiter for emergency departments, alternates shifts with the skilled nurses: She acts as Joe\u2019s caregiver from 4 p.m. to 11 p.m. on weekdays and 3 p.m. to 11 p.m. on weekends.\n\n\u201cOvernight, we have a nurse for seven hours so I can rest before I start it all over again,\u201d Donna said.\n\nTommy Swider, Joe\u2019s youngest brother and an executive at a software company, set up a GoFundMe.com page to help raise money for Joe\u2019s care. But as far as he\u2019s concerned, he said the crowdfunding is simply \u201cbuying time.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like, over $233,000 a year,\u201d Tommy, 55, of Mount Laurel, New Jersey, told FoxNews.com. \u201cWho the hell has money like that laying around?\u201d\n\nTaking on the system\n\nAs Tommy, Joe and Donna race to raise funds, thousands of strangers are rallying around the family. Meanwhile, the Swiders are searching for options.\n\n\u201cThis is a man who is completely dedicated to his family,\u201d Donna said. \u201cHe\u2019ll tell you\u2014 there\u2019s so much to live for.\u201d\n\nMichael Burns, an attorney at South Hampton, Penn.-based firm Bowlen & Burns, began working with the Swiders when they took their case to court in October 2015 because he witnessed his grandfather, a unionized steelworker with Bethlehem Steel, face a similar health insurance hurdle.\n\n\u201cI just felt compelled to help Joe out given his circumstances,\u201d Burns told FoxNews.com.\n\nThe Swiders recalled Burns thinking the case would be easy to win.\n\n\u201cWe thought we had such a slam dunk,\u201d said Joe, who speaks hoarsely through a microphone because ALS has weakened the muscles that help his vocal chords function.\n\nThe Swiders say the U.A. Local Union No. 322 promised equal or greater benefits with the new plan, but the union and its board of trustees ended up not delivering on that promise. The switch ultimately translated to a basic Medicare supplement plan, categorized as supplement F, that didn\u2019t cover the private skilled nursing Swider needed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the difference between a Mercedes and a Ford Pinto,\u201d Joe said.\n\nJoe had been receiving the private skilled nursing for free under his previous Horizon Blue Cross plan for about 16 hours a day, seven days a week for nearly all of the previous three and a half years. Donna said the health insurance she could get through her job doesn\u2019t cover the benefit either, and the family also explored using a rider that would grant them the benefit, but those efforts were unsuccessful. They also couldn\u2019t get the coverage extended via COBRA because the union terminated the plan, Donna noted.\n\nPaying out of pocket for the skilled nursing is costly, but the family said they can\u2019t afford to pursue further legal action because they need that money to keep Joe alive.\n\n\u201c[Joe] has a tracheotomy, so he does require skilled nursing care,\u201d Jill Romoff, client services manager at Bayada, which has provided Joe\u2019s care since mid-2012, told FoxNews.com. \u201cCaregivers aren\u2019t nurses; they wouldn\u2019t know what to do.\u201d\n\nNot only do the skilled nurses help feed Joe, and help him shower and use the restroom, but they also are trained to perform cough assists and maintain his trach, which contains an inner tube\u2014 similar to a straw inside a garden hose. The hose helps dispose of the mucus and phlegm Joe\u2019s body still produces, but that he cannot cough up. Without the device, those substances would accumulate in his lungs\u2014 which operate on a ventilator\u2014 and he would contract pneumonia.\n\nSometimes, the inner tube itself gets plugged up.\n\n\u201cIf he gets plugged up, he stops breathing,\u201d Mary Adekanye, a registered nurse and the clinical manager at Bayada who oversees Joe\u2019s care, told FoxNews.com. \u201cThat means someone needs to act fast. They need to change the trach, and that needs to be done within the minute, and if not, he could pass away.\u201d\n\nJoe said the problem is twofold: \u201cWhen I do plug up, it\u2019s cut off from my lungs but also my vocal chords\u2014 so I can\u2019t talk. So whoever\u2019s watching me has to know what they\u2019re doing. They have to react.\u201d\n\nKurt R. Krueger, business manager of the U.A. Local Union 322, declined to discuss the case with FoxNews.com, but he provided a memo stating that its welfare fund lost over $5 million in 2014, \u201cand the Welfare Trustees have a duty to the some 1,700 other participants in the Welfare Fund and their families as well.\u201d The memo also stated that Joe didn\u2019t have a case under a discriminatory basis, \u201cas he is not an employee and has not been denied any benefit promised by the plan.\u201d\n\nIn the memo, the union attributed the funding of Joe\u2019s private nursing care to \u201can administrative mistake as a Horizon\u2019s appeal determination sets a May 2, 2012 cut-off date.\u201d\n\nThe Swiders told FoxNews.com that Bayada submitted for re-certification of coverage with Blue Cross every three months, and that Joe\u2019s care over that timespan totaled about $1.7 million. They argued in their case that their previous insurance plan booklet stated 100 percent coverage of skilled nursing with zero copay.\n\n\u201cEven assuming that Horizon was correct in covering the private nursing care,\u201d the memo reads, \u201cthe Welfare Fund Trustees had a right to terminate the Horizon policy and replace it with a new policy.\u201d\n\nThe Swiders hired Burns to handle their case following a union board of trustees Q&A meeting in mid-July, when they got a clear answer that the private skilled nursing wouldn\u2019t be covered. However, a letter they received in mid-June specifically stated the plan would be changing but not the benefits, Donna said.\n\nBurns said the judge\u2019s final ruling came down to a simple settlor function under The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), a federal law that allows for certain institutions to change or eliminate terms in health plans.\n\nThe Swiders said the change was made possible due to four words stamped on the bottom of every page of their health insurance documents: \u201cPlan subject to change.\u201d\n\n\u201cI call it \u2018the legal right to lie,\u2019\u201d Joe said. \u201cYou either say what you mean, or you don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nA disturbing trend\n\nJoe\u2019s story may not be all that uncommon.\n\nGregory Dell, a nationwide disability insurance attorney with Hollywood, Fla.-based firm Dell & Schaefer, who was not involved in the Swiders\u2019 case, said he has noticed an uptick in insurance policy changes that leave retirees at a disadvantage.\n\n\u201cSometimes, what they do with these pension deals is they say, \u2018We\u2019re going to give you coverage, but it doesn\u2019t have to [be] good coverage,\u2019\u201d Dell told Foxnews.com. \u201cI think since ObamaCare came out, you\u2019ve seen a lot more of this. It especially happens to retirees. Companies were able to get more affordable health plans for the company [with ObamaCare], but it ends up costing the disabled retirees, or retirees, more money.\u201d\n\nBurns said these sorts of health insurance switches are \u201cwhat all the unions are doing.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s becoming more common to the extent they can do it, to change the health plans to limit the services,\u201d he said.\n\nDonna said she tried reaching out to U.S. Rep. Frank LoBiondo (R-N.J.), which serves the Swiders' hometown of Atco in the state\u2019s second congressional district, Sens. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), Assistant Majority Leader James Beach (D-N.J.) and Assemblyman Troy Singleton (D-N.J.), but they all said the family\u2019s case was a private matter. FoxNews.com contacted the office of Rep. LoBiondo, as well as U.S. Rep. Chris Smith (R-N.J.), which deferred comment to the office of U.S. Rep. Donald Norcross (D-N.J.), and they all declined to comment.\n\nBrian T. Murray, press secretary for New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, also declined to comment on the Swiders\u2019 case.\n\nThe legal trials compelled the union to extend Joe\u2019s coverage until Jan. 17, after which the Swiders began paying for the service out of pocket. The benefit was originally scheduled to expire in August 2015.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no more,\u201d Joe said of pursuing further legal action. \u201cWe can\u2019t put money out toward a wild goose chase when we thought we had a good case and got the door slammed in our face.\u201d\n\nFighting on\n\nAs Tommy Swider continues to research alternative health insurance options for his brother, the GoFundMe page he set up on Jan. 3, 2016 had raised about $49,000 of its $75,000 goal as of Tuesday morning\u2014 thanks to the support of more than 430 donors. The Swiders said the goal amount was picked somewhat arbitrarily and can be adjusted. They estimated the donations they have received so far would last them through the first week of April.\n\n\u201cWhen the money runs out, I guess we call hospice because I don\u2019t see any other way around it,\u201d Joe said. \u201cObviously, that doesn\u2019t deliver very well with the family, but if you\u2019ve got a better way, tell me about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe last thing I want to do is watch myself suffocate because something happened and the person watching over me didn\u2019t know how to fix it,\u201d Joe said, \u201cand that\u2019s nothing against my family, but they\u2019re not trained like the nurses are.\u201d\n\nDonna described Joe as \u201cthe ultimate Mr. Fix-It\u201d\u2014 someone who loved building furniture and helping his kids with plumbing issues when he was able and healthy. He also loved to babysit his grandchildren, whom he can no longer hold.\n\nBut she\u2019s not giving up on Joe.\n\n\u201cAnytime I think we\u2019re at the end of our rope, something miraculous happens,\u201d Donna said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what we\u2019re going to do when the funds dry out\u2014 and they will.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe just try to stay strong and have faith, and see what the next chapter is in our story,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd I know that sounds corny, but in our society, it just can\u2019t happen like this.\u201d\n\n", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX
