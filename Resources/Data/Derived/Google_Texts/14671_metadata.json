The main opposition, Fianna Fail, appears to be running a close second, suggesting that Kenny will need Fianna Fail to form a government.\n\nAfter the exit results became clear, Kenny ruled out resigning. \"Democracy is always exciting but it is merciless when it kicks in,\" RTE News reported Kenny to have said. He also rejected another Fine Gail-Labor coalition government.\n\nKenny looks to have become the latest victim of an anti-establishment groundswell spreading across Europe even though his premiership has seen Ireland bounce back from a bailout to become the continent's fastest growing economy.\n\n\n\nKenny's center-right Fine Gael will win the election with 24.8 percent of the vote, the exit poll for national broadcaster RTE said. That is far below the 36 percent it won five years ago and the 30 percent opinion poll rating it enjoyed at the start of campaigning.\n\nWith partners Labour in line to win just 7.1 percent of the ballot, the only viable option for government appeared to be a problematic alliance between historic rivals Fine Gael and Fianna Fail, which the exit poll showed rose to 21.1 percent.\n\n\"Either we could have another election now and do away with the count, or we'll let them muddle around for a month or so and maybe they can think the unthinkable,\" said Michael Marsh, a professor of politics at Trinity College Dublin.\n\n\"It's hard to see any kind of government without Fine Gael and Fianna Fail getting together.\"\n\n", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "cnbcnewsstory", "description": "Ireland looked set to kick Prime Minister Enda Kenny's coalition government out of office in an election on Friday with no clear alternative in sight, exit polls indicated.", "author": "CNBC", "og": {"site_name": "CNBC", "description": "Ireland looked set to kick Prime Minister Enda Kenny's coalition government out of office in an election on Friday, exit polls showed.", "title": "Ireland set for unprecedented alliance after polls", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2016/02/27/ireland-set-to-oust-government-in-election-no-obvious-replacement-exit-poll.html", "image": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2016/02/27/103425006-GettyImages-512424428.1910x1000.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Ireland looked set to kick Prime Minister Enda Kenny's coalition government out of office in an election on Friday, exit polls showed.", "title": "Ireland set to oust government, no obvious replacement: Exit polls", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2016/02/27/ireland-set-to-oust-government-in-election-no-obvious-replacement-exit-poll.html", "image": {"src": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2016/02/27/103425006-GettyImages-512424428.1910x1000.jpg"}, "site": "@CNBC", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"ios": {"app_name": "CNBC Business News and Finance", "app_store_id": 398018310}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=398018310", "GOOGLEBOT": "unavailable_after: 31 Dec 9999 23:59:59 GMT", "keywords": "Elections, Politics, Ireland, European Union, Europe, business news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cnbc", "published_time": "2016-02-27T16:51:11-0500", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/CNBC", "section": "Elections", "modified_time": "2016-02-27T16:51:41-0500", "tag": "Europe"}, "pageNodeId": 103425005, "news_keywords": "Ireland, Enda Kenny, politics, elections, Irish elections, austerity"}, "article_summary": "The main opposition, Fianna Fail, appears to be running a close second, suggesting that Kenny will need Fianna Fail to form a government.\n\"It's hard to see any kind of government without Fine Gael and Fianna Fail getting together.\"\nKenny's center-right Fine Gael will win the election with 24.8 percent of the vote, the exit poll for national broadcaster RTE said.\nPolls suggest that Fine Gael will remain the largest party, but only narrowly so.\n\"Democracy is always exciting but it is merciless when it kicks in,\" RTE News reported Kenny to have said."}
