So half my shift, almost half my shift,\u201d she said.\n\nWith this kind of time requirement, it is well worth the $13 an hour that lead ED scribe Tyrell Kirchhefer makes as he works toward his goal of getting into medical school, Tortorich said.\n\nHowever, Dr. George Gellert, medical informatics officer at Christus Health, Irving, Texas, argued that the medical scribe industry actually is standing in the way of progress by giving EMR developers a disincentive to improve the documentation functionality of their products. Gellert explained his viewpoint in a recent commentary in the Journal of the American Medical Association.\n\nTake a listen, and try not to cringe when \u201cMarketplace\u201d host Kai Ryssdal misleadingly states that the move toward EMRs was \u201cin part because of the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s called the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act, Mr. Ryssdal. It was part of the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, a year before the Affordable Care Act came to be.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The medical scribe industry is booming, as listeners of American Public Media's \"Marketplace\" heard Tuesday, and is forecast to employ 100,000 by 2020, five times the number today.
