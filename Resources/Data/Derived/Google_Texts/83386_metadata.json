( Courtesy photo/Michael Cotton )\n\nMichael Cotton has deliberately adopted a scruffy look, for this month, at least.\n\nHe's made this a \"No-Shave November\" and says \"it's annoying,\" but it's for a cause.\n\nCotton, a writer and a fitness instructor at Frederick's Tri Town Brazilian Jiu Jitsu Academy, and his wife Emily, the pharmacy manager at Firestone's King Soopers store, are on the board of Voices4Peru, a foundation that sponsors a school, a soccer club and other activities for children in Ventanilla, an impoverished Peruvian community in the foothills north of Lima.\n\nIn September, the Firestone couple made their first personal visit to that community and the kids and families benefiting from the foundation's work in that crime-ridden community, a trip he said was \"a life-changing experience.\"\n\nNow that they're back, Michael Cotton is resuming his efforts to raise awareness about \u2014 and funds for \u2014 Voices4Peru. Hence, the November beard.\n\n\"They say when your palms itch, you are about to come into some money,\" Cotton has written on his Facebook page. \"Well, I hope that saying is true about beards too, because mine is driving me nuts. I hope you get the itch to donate.\"\n\nIf end-of-November contributions total $1,200 \u2014 the annual amount it costs to send one child to the foundation's school \u2014 Cotton will shave his head, including the increasingly uncomfortable beard.\n\nIf the donations total $1,800, he'll temporarily leave enough hair for a \"Mr. T\"-style mohawk, named after the actor best known for his roles in the TV series \"The A-Team\" and the movie \"Rocky III.\"\n\nIf he's able to get $2,400 for the foundation, Cotton has promised to undergo an on-camera chest waxing \u2014 something, he joked, might rival the one administered to actor Steve Carell in the film \"The 40 -Year-Old Virgin.\"\n\nCotton is appealing on Facebook and his organization's website \u2014 V4Peru.com \u2014 for people to donate whatever they can, even if it's only $1 or $10 \u2014 not just for his current personal drive, but for he year-around fund raising he said Voices4Peru needs to help children and families in Ventanilla.\n\nMichael Cotton is growing a beard as part of a fundraiser for Voices4Peru. Depending on how much money is raised, Cotton will shave parts or all of the hair on his head, including the beard.

They were very loving.\"\n\nSaid Cotton: \"We will return to Peru. We just don't know when.\" He said it would be nice if he and his wife could visit the children and families there annually but that it might have to be every other year.\n\nIn the meantime, there's a continuing need for sponsors for the children participating in the foundation's school and other programs, Cotton said, and he appealed to people to help out, even if they can't afford a full sponsorship.\n\n\"Even if it's only a $1 donation, that's $1 we didn't have,\" Cotton said.\n\nJohn Fryar: 303-684-5211, jfryar@times-call.com or twitter.com/jfryartc", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_26998140/firestone-man-will-shave-help-fund-peruvian-kids", "modificationDate": "2014-11-23T17:41:42-0700", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2014/1123/20141123__24TCATAKw~2_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By John Fryar \n \n  Times-Call staff writer", "description": "Cotton, a writer and a fitness  instructor at Frederick's Tri Town Brazilian Jiu Jitsu Academy, and his wife Emily, the pharmacy manager at Firestone's King Soopers store,  are on the board of  Voices4Peru, a  foundation that sponsors a school, a soccer club and other activities for children in Ventanilla, an impoverished Peruvian community in the foothills north of Lima.", "ag": {"canon": "LongmontTimes-Call:article:26998140:view"}, "startDate": "2014-11-23T19:39:34-0700", "og": {"url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_26998140/firestone-man-will-shave-help-fund-peruvian-kids", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2014/1123/20141123__24TCATAKw~3.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Cotton, a writer and a fitness  instructor at Frederick's Tri Town Brazilian Jiu Jitsu Academy, and his wife Emily, the pharmacy manager at Firestone's King Soopers store,  are on the board of  Voices4Peru, a  foundation that sponsors a school, a soccer club and other activities for children in Ventanilla, an impoverished Peruvian community in the foothills north of Lima.", "title": "Firestone man will shave to help fund Peruvian kids programs"}, "twitter": {"domain": "timescall.com", "description": "Cotton, a writer and a fitness  instructor at Frederick's Tri Town Brazilian Jiu Jitsu Academy, and his wife Emily, the pharmacy manager at Firestone's King Soopers store,  are on the board of  Voices4Peru, a  foundation that sponsors a school, a soccer club and other activities for children in Ventanilla, an impoverished Peruvian community in the foothills north of Lima.", "title": "Firestone man will shave to help fund Peruvian kids programs", "url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_26998140/firestone-man-will-shave-help-fund-peruvian-kids", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2014/1123/20141123__24TCATAKw~3.jpg", "site": "@TimesCall", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-11-23T19:39:34-0700", "sailthru.site": "timescall.com", "endDate": "2024-11-23T17:39:34-0700", "sailthru.title": "Firestone man will shave to help fund Peruvian kids programs", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Local News", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "lLtD9ZooxmJUEEdRSCVzkO06t_hYKtyDqZF7EA3N2U0", "byline": "By John FryarTimes-Call", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2014/1123/20141123__24TCATAKw~2.jpg", "pubDate": "2014-11-23T17:42:12-0700", "news_keywords": "Longmont Colorado TimesCall local news"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3e44\"", "article_summary": "( Courtesy photo/Michael Cotton )Michael Cotton has deliberately adopted a scruffy look, for this month, at least.\nIf end-of-November contributions total $1,200 \u2014 the annual amount it costs to send one child to the foundation's school \u2014 Cotton will shave his head, including the increasingly uncomfortable beard.\nNow that they're back, Michael Cotton is resuming his efforts to raise awareness about \u2014 and funds for \u2014 Voices4Peru.\nMichael Cotton poses with children at the school the Voices4Peru foundation serves in the Lima suburb Ventanilla.\n\"She was amazing,\" Michael Cotton said."}
