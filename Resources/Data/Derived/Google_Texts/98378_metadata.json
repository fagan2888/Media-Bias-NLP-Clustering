It will be a blend of free live workshops and online training and more advanced, in-depth paid courses.\n\n\"One Spark is really looking at this as something that we're not looking to make money on. This is something that we absolutely want to provide to the creators as a resource to find success at the world's crowdfunding festival,\" said Joe Sampson, executive director of One Spark. \"It can be really tough to turn your idea into a reality. Headed into the third year in Jacksonville we think it's time to bring this to life and see how it works out.\"\n\nFor more information about the workshops schedule and curriculum, visit OneSparkCreatorAcademy.com.\n\nCopyright 2014 by News4Jax.com.
