REUTERS/Carlos Barria\n\n4713762\n\nPresident Obama announced a new executive order on Tuesday which authorizes federal agencies to conduct behavioral experiments on U.S. citizens in order to advance government initiatives.\n\n\u201cA growing body of evidence demonstrates that behavioral science insights \u2014 research findings from fields such as behavioral economics and psychology about how people make decisions and act on them \u2014 can be used to design government policies to better serve the American people,\u201d reads the executive order, released on Tuesday.\n\nThe new program is the end result of a policy proposal the White House floated in 2013 entitled \u201cStrengthening Federal Capacity for Behavioral Insights.\u201d\n\nAccording to a document released by the White House at that time, the program was modeled on one implemented in the U.K. in 2010. That initiative created a Behavioral Insights Teams, which used \u201citerative experimentation\u201d to test \u201cinterventions that will further advance priorities of the British government.\u201d\n\nThe initiative draws on research from University of Chicago economist Richard Thaler and Harvard law school professor Cass Sunstein, who was also dubbed Obama\u2019s regulatory czar. The two behavioral scientists argued in their 2008 book \u201cNudge\u201d that government policies can be designed in a way that \u201cnudges\u201d citizens towards certain behaviors and choices.\n\nThe desired choices almost always advance the goals of the federal government, though they are often couched as ways to cut overall program spending.\n\nIn its 2013 memo, which was reported by Fox News at the time, the White House openly admitted that the initiative involved behavioral experimentation.\n\n\u201cThe federal government is currently creating a new team that will help build federal capacity to experiment with these approaches, and to scale behavioral interventions that have been rigorously evaluated, using, where possible, randomized controlled trials,\u201d the memo read.\n\nThat document cited examples from the U.K. which showed that sending out a letter to late taxpayers which read \u201c9 out of 10 people in Britain pay their taxes on time\u201d led to a 15 percent increase in compliance.\n\nThe new executive order encourages federal agencies to \u201cidentify policies, programs, and operations where applying behavioral science insights may yield substantial improvements in public welfare, program outcomes, and program cost effectiveness,\u201d as well as to \u201cdevelop strategies for applying behavioral science insights to programs and, where possible, rigorously test and evaluate the impact of these insights.\u201d\n\nTo jump-start the programs, agencies are encouraged to recruit behavioral science experts to join the federal government and to develop relationships with researchers in order to \u201cbetter use empirical findings from the behavioral sciences.\u201d\n\nA fact sheet sent out by the White House on Tuesday shows that researchers at numerous universities and think tanks \u2014 from MIT, Harvard, and the Brookings Institute, to name a few \u2014 have signed on to the program.\n\nThe executive order specifically directs federal agencies to develop nudge programs that help individuals, families, communities and businesses \u201caccess public programs and benefits by, as appropriate, streamlining processes that may otherwise limit or delay participation.\u201d\n\nThis can be achieved by \u201cadministrative hurdles, shortening wait times, and simplifying forms,\u201d the order suggests.\n\nThe initiative also urges agencies to tinker with how information is presented to individuals, consumers, borrowers, and program beneficiaries.\n\nThe \u201ccontent, format, timing, and medium by which information is conveyed\u201d should be taken into consideration as those characteristics affect \u201ccomprehension and action by individuals.\u201d\n\nIn programs that offer choices for consumers, agencies are instructed to \u201cconsider how the presentation and structure of those choices, including the order, number, and arrangement of options, can most effectively promote public welfare.\u201d\n\nThe order also suggests that agencies fiddle with whether to label certain expenditures as \u201cbenefits, taxes, subsidies\u201d or other incentives to \u201cefficiently promote\u201d programs.\n\nPresident Obama\u2019s federal health care law, Obamacare, is replete with \u201cnudge\u201d language and experimentation.\n\nIn its fact sheet, the White House noted that reminding individuals who had started to sign up for Obamacare led to a 13 percent increase in completed applications.\n\nTo help determine which presentation was more effective, the Department of Health and Human Services \u201csent one of eight behaviorally designed letter variants to each of more than 700,000 individuals who had already begun the health insurance enrollment process but had not yet completed an application.\u201d\n\nThe most effective version of the letter generated the 13 percent improvement. Other less effective letters only increased enrollment rates by around four percent.\n\nAnother nudge contained in Obamacare was brought to light in the debate over whether the individual mandate contained in the law was a tax hike.\n\nRepublicans insisted that it was a tax increase, but the White House portrayed it as a penalty on the logic that the word \u201ctax\u201d has a negative connotation.\n\nWhile the Obama administration touts nudge policies, others are hesitant to get on board.\n\n\u201cI am very skeptical of a team promoting nudge policies,\u201d Michael Thomas, an economist at Utah State University, told Fox News in 2013.\n\n\u201cUltimately, nudging\u2026assumes a small group of people in government know better about choices than the individuals making them.\u201d\n\nFollow Chuck on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Chuck Ross", "description": "President Obama announced a new executive order on Tuesday which authorizes federal agencies to conduct behavioral experiments on U.S. citizens.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "President Obama announced a new executive order on Tuesday which authorizes federal agencies to conduct behavioral experiments on U.S. citizens in order to advance government initiatives.    \"A growin", "title": "President Obama Orders Behavioral Experiments On American Public", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2015/09/15/president-obama-orders-behavioral-experiments-on-american-public/", "image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/2015-09-01T000723Z_1_LYNXNPEB800YP_RTROPTP_4_USA-KATRINA-e1441737830756.jpg", "height": 344}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "'Nudge squads'", "title": "President Obama Orders Behavioral Experiments On American Public Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2015/09/15/president-obama-orders-behavioral-experiments-on-american-public/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/2015-09-01T000723Z_1_LYNXNPEB800YP_RTROPTP_4_USA-KATRINA-e1441737830756.jpg"}, "creator": "@@ChuckRossDC", "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-09-15 14:12:29", "sailthru.title": "President Obama Orders Behavioral Experiments On American Public", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "sailthru.tags": "chuck-ross", "sailthru.description": "President Obama announced a new executive order on Tuesday which authorizes federal agencies to conduct behavioral experiments on U.S. citizens in order to advance government initiatives.    \"A growin", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/2015-09-01T000723Z_1_LYNXNPEB800YP_RTROPTP_4_USA-KATRINA-e1441737830756.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcf9f\"", "article_summary": "REUTERS/Carlos Barria4713762President Obama announced a new executive order on Tuesday which authorizes federal agencies to conduct behavioral experiments on U.S. citizens in order to advance government initiatives.\nWhile the Obama administration touts nudge policies, others are hesitant to get on board.\n\u201cI am very skeptical of a team promoting nudge policies,\u201d Michael Thomas, an economist at Utah State University, told Fox News in 2013.\nIn its 2013 memo, which was reported by Fox News at the time, the White House openly admitted that the initiative involved behavioral experimentation.\nIn its fact sheet, the White House noted that reminding individuals who had started to sign up for Obamacare led to a 13 percent increase in completed applications."}
