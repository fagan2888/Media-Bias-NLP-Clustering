Four people have been arrested and another is being sought in connection with a fatal shooting of a teenager Friday in the parking lot of Olive Garden, North Charleston police said.

The victim, who was shot in an apparent drug deal, died after being transported to the Medical University Hospital, police said.

He has been identified as 15-year-old Derrick Roper of Charleston, according to the Charleston County Coroner’s office. Investigators believe Roper and the suspects met up in the restaurant’s parking lot for a drug deal, Pryor said.

Police responded to the shooting at 6:22 p.m. Friday on Northwoods Boulevard to find a passenger in a tan Nissan Moreno with a gunshot wound to the upper left shoulder, police said.

Calvin Dennis Benekin Jr., 22, of Wolverine Drive in North Charleston was arrested and charged with murder on Saturday, police spokesman Spencer Pryor said. He is being held at the Charleston County jail.

A second murder warrant was issued for Jamal S. Drayton, 22, of Pinewood Dr. Summerville. He is still being sought by police.

Police are also looking for a burgundy 2004 Saturn Ion with the South Carolina license plate EFV985, Pryor said.

Deshone Bernard Rivers, 19, of Richmond Street in Charleston and Brittney Wall, 23, of Woodstock Avenue in North Charleston were charged with conspiracy to violate narcotics laws, and Tyler Linwood White, 20, of Bonaparte Drive in North Charleston was charged with possession with intent to distribute marijuana, according to police.

All three are believed to have been involved with coordinating and/or participating in the arrangement of the drug transaction, Pryor said.
