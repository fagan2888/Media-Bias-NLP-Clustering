It misallocates all of the resources so that everybody is worse off than they would have been if they had just allowed free men and women to make their own decisions,\u201d Jane Orient, a doctor with the group, told TPM. \u201cThe remedy is for patients and physicians is to decline to participate in the system, go for a true free-market alternative.\u201d\n\nOrient said she fears that the federal government could \u201coutlaw private practice, just like they did in Canada.\u201d\n\nBut maybe this kind of over-heated rhetoric isn\u2019t so surprising from a group with AAPS\u2019s record.\n\nBack in 2009, one member of the group, Florida neurosurgeon Dr. David McKalip, withdrew temporarily from the healthcare debate after being caught forwarding a racist email that depicted President Obama as a witch doctor. Within months, McKalip had rejoined the battle, reporting back to fellow conservatives from an AAPS meeting that featured Reps. Paul Broun and Tom Price, among others.\n\nOn one level, though, this is encouraging for supporters of Obamacare.
