Re “Paying Respects, Pentagon Revives Vietnam, and War Over Truth” (front page, Oct. 10), about the Pentagon’s plans for a 50th-anniversary commemoration of the Vietnam War and the objections of scholars, veterans and activists to having the military write the era’s history:

It’s interesting that nearly half a century after the end of the Vietnam War the debate over commemoration still seems to ignore the primary victims of the war: the civilian population of Vietnam. It is inevitable that the Pentagon would like to put a spin on the war that emphasizes the heroism and sacrifices of American soldiers. But the central, enduring moral horror of that conflict was that countless civilian noncombatants died as a direct result of our intervention. There are also many thousands in Vietnam today, including the victims of our use of the toxic defoliant Agent Orange, who continue to suffer.

Perhaps the best way to commemorate the war would be for our country to move to alleviate the horrors they and their families endure.

There are two good ways to honor Vietnam veterans.

The first would be a commemoration-long apology for sending them into a hellish, unjustified war in the first place. Second would be to spare no expense in taking better care of veterans, including today’s, by giving the wounded, the spiritually damaged and the traumatized all the help they need so they can live decent lives as civilians.

It’s an axiom that history is written by the winners. But in this case, it appears, history is being rewritten by the losers.
