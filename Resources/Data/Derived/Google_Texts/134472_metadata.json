But when one woman called about her dying husband, Meeks saw firsthand the tragedy a lack of health coverage can bring.\n\nIn November, the woman called for her husband, who had not enrolled in a Medicare Part D plan when he had first become disabled, and who had been diagnosed with cancer. \u201cI knew I couldn\u2019t help her right then \u2014 I could sign him up for coverage starting Jan. 1, but I started asking if he might qualify for extra help,\u201d Meeks said. \u201cI took their income \u2014 no, they were over. I asked if there was anyone else living in the house, and she said she had sons, so that put them in range. I filled out her application, never promising her anything, but giving her a little bit of hope.\u201d\n\nMeeks checked every other day to see whether the application had been approved. The woman called again to tell Meeks that her husband had received two pain medication prescriptions they couldn\u2019t afford to fill, and so she checked again, but the application had yet to be approved. Later the same night, Meeks said something told her to check the application again, and she found that it had been approved. The family got two prescriptions valued at more than $180 for less than $7.\n\n\u201cShe called me back and said, \u2018If I had found you four or five months ago, I really think he wouldn\u2019t be dying,\u2019\u201d Meeks said.\n\nThe same woman called Meeks again last Friday to tell her that her husband had died.\n\n\u201cI though to myself, \u2018I wasn\u2019t able to help him for very long, but at least I helped him get that pain medication,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nMeeks, director of the West Virginia State Health Insurance Assistance Program and the Senior Medicare Patrol Program, deals primarily with Medicare recipients, but her office also has an in-person assister trained to help people enroll in expanded Medicaid and individual coverage through the Affordable Care Act.\n\nShe was one of nearly 100 health insurance navigators gathered in Charleston Tuesday to celebrate the more than 200,000 West Virginians who have gained insurance coverage since 2013 under the ACA. The event fell 18 days ahead of the deadline for 2016 ACA health insurance enrollment on Jan. 31.\n\nThis is the third year of ACA open enrollment. According to West Virginians for Affordable Health Care, the organization that coordinated the event, more than 34,450 West Virginians have newly enrolled or re-enrolled for individual insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace, and more than 165,000 have enrolled in expanded Medicaid. West Virginia has seen a huge drop in the rate of uninsured, from 14 percent in 2013 to 8.6 percent in 2014.\n\n\u201cWe know that in those last couple of weeks everyone will be coming out, and I think it\u2019s important to remind people of the penalty,\u201d said Joanne Grossi, regional director of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nThis year, the tax penalty for forgoing health insurance is 2.5 percent of a person\u2019s income or $695 per adult, whichever is higher.\n\nAccording to Scott Streator, vice president of CareSource, an Ohio-based nonprofit managed care organization that now operates in 10 West Virginia counties, a market study the company conducted before entering the state revealed that while only 9 percent of West Virginians characterize their health as \u201cexcellent,\u201d a full two-thirds believe it could be improved, and most cited health-care affordability as the second-most important barrier to wellness behind lack of exercise.\n\nTo counteract that, CareSource is offering $0 copays on generic drugs for its silver plans, as well as $0 copays for primary care visits, with no limit on how many primary care visits a consumer can have in a given year, Streator said. CareSource is offered to residents in Brooke, Cabell, Hancock, Kanawha, Lincoln, Marshall, Mason, Ohio, Putnam and Wayne counties.\n\nFor Colleen Anderson, health coverage has been her single biggest expense in her 40-year career as a self-employed graphic designer and writer who was diagnosed with high blood pressure early in her career.\n\n\u201cI never had to use it; I\u2019m very, very lucky, because I don\u2019t know where that $10,000 or sometimes $20,000 deductible would have come from, but it was a constant source of stress for me,\u201d she said. \u201cThen, two years ago, I got affordable health care, and for the first time in my working life, I could afford it, and it was good insurance. I actually had a copay for the first time in my life.\u201d\n\nMany federally-qualified health centers, hospitals and state agencies offer in-person assisters trained to help people navigate the health insurance marketplace and select a plan. West Virginia NaviCare has several enrollment events scheduled across the state, including on Thursday from 1 p.m. to 7 p.m. at Summersville Regional Medical Center, Thursday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. at Davis Medical Center in Elkins, and on Tuesday from noon to 7 p.m. at the Bridgeport Conference Center in Bridgeport. More events will be held on Jan. 20 from noon to 7 p.m. at the Hilton Garden Inn in Morgantown, Jan. 21 from noon to 7 p.m. at West Virginia Northern Community College in Wheeling, Jan. 25 and Jan.26 from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. at the Wood County Courthouse in Parkersburg, Jan. 29 from 3 p.m. to 8 p.m. at Disability Action in Fairmont, and on Jan. 30 and Jan. 31 from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. at Raleigh County Convention Center in Beckley.\n\nReach Lydia Nuzum at lydia.nuzum@wvgazettemail.com, 304-348-5189 or follow @lydianuzum on Twitter.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Charleston Gazette-Mail", "title": "Mitch Vingle: Examining the state\u2019s D-I baseball crop", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.wvgazettemail.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CH/20160524/GZ020401/160529757/AR/0/AR-160529757.jpg", "url": "http://www.wvgazettemail.com/sports-mitch-vingle/20160524/mitch-vingle-examining-the-states-d-i-baseball-crop", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Charleston Gazette-Mail", "description": "See attached", "creator": "@wvgazettemail", "image": {"src": "http://www.wvgazettemail.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CH/20160524/GZ020401/160529757/AR/0/AR-160529757.jpg"}, "title": "Mitch Vingle: Examining the state\u2019s D-I baseball crop", "site": "@wvgazettemail", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "google-site-verification": "1bw05nOwAmeGwNrWfrMp361tiStYbQbOwqqj_P_-LVA", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/charlestongazettemail"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "dc.title": "Mitch Vingle: Examining the state\u2019s D-I baseball crop"}, "article_summary": "West Virginia has seen a huge drop in the rate of uninsured, from 14 percent in 2013 to 8.6 percent in 2014.\nThis year, the tax penalty for forgoing health insurance is 2.5 percent of a person\u2019s income or $695 per adult, whichever is higher.\nThe same woman called Meeks again last Friday to tell her that her husband had died.\nThe event fell 18 days ahead of the deadline for 2016 ACA health insurance enrollment on Jan. 31.\nMarcia Meeks fields dozens of calls every day from people trying to enroll in health insurance."}
