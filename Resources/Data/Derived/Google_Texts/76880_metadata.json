The sessions will be conducted at the TigerLabs offices on Nassau Street in Princeton and through online subscriptions.\n\nThose who put down a few hundred dollars and commit to the sessions will come away with a business plan that just may qualify for an extra sit-down with company executives, who are in the business, after all, of investing in promising start-ups.\n\nTigerLabs aims to be the epicenter of the entrepreneurial spirit in Princeton, its founders said during an interview last week. The boot camp is simply one of its opening salvos.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a great history of entrepreneurship in the Princeton community, but there\u2019s never really been one thing to aggregate that community,\u201d said James Smits, one of TigerLabs\u2019 partners and its program director. \u201cTigerLabs is an entrepreneurial epicenter. In terms of the ideal participant for the boot camp, it\u2019s really open to anyone and everyone \u2014 people who want to learn more about digital health care, people who want to be entrepreneurs, someone who wants to start their own digital app.\u201d\n\nBill Zeruld, a health-care consultant who will be running the boot camp, said there are up to 97,000 apps on different technology platforms in the health-care space alone.\n\nThe possibilities for an engaged, spirited entrepreneur are wide open. But, Zeruld added, health care is a complex landscape that entrepreneurs need to learn how to navigate before they can consider the worth of a new product or application.\n\nThe boot camp will offer a broad survey of the health-care industry, including the roles of payers, providers, pharmaceutical companies, government agencies, consumers and other stakeholders in the digital health-care world.\n\nThe latter half of the sessions will focus on what it takes to launch a business. Participants will have direct access to veteran health-care entrepreneurs, operators and investors to learn how to build a dynamic team, product development considerations, technology and legal issues, and how to take a product to market, among other subjects.\n\nThe fee for a general participant is $500. Full-time students will pay $200.\n\nTigerLabs CEO and founding partner Bert Navarrete said that although the company may expand its interests beyond health care, it is focusing on that industry with its start-up investments right now. In part this is because of the large number of industry players located in and around Mercer County, he said.\n\nThe other reason, of course, is opportunity.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very excited about the rapid innovation in health care, and that the industry is recognizing that there are new ways to deliver both their primary product as well as gain direct access to consumers,\u201d Navarrete said.\n\nFor example, a new direction for health care goes by the term \u201cremote monitoring,\u201d and involves the collection of personal health data by consumers for analysis by a variety of health care providers.\n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s counting calories or how they\u2019re sleeping, we\u2019re going to see a big demand in that area,\u201d Zeruld said.\n\nWith all that data comes the need to crunch it effectively. Therefore, TigerLabs executives said, there will be a demand in ways to process and analyze information. Apps for doing that will proliferate.\n\nIn addition, the Affordable Care Act has ushered in a new age of comparison shopping, something that consumers were not sufficiently motivated to pursue in the past.\n\n\u201cI think transparency is going to be a huge piece, an opportunity to look at providers and compare them based on how effective their outcomes are as well as their costs,\u201d said Zeruld. \u201cNow we\u2019re going to see patients more accountable for their own payment, so they\u2019re going to be looking for increasing levels of transparency.\u201d\n\nNavarrete has been a venture capitalist for his entire post-graduate career. He has been involved primarily in investing in software companies, first with Merrill Lynch, and later with Mitsui & Co, one of the world\u2019s largest trading, investment and service companies, based in Tokyo. TigerLabs also works closely with Princeton University\u2019s prestigious Keller Center of Innovation.\n\n\u201cTigerLabs has contributed greatly to entrepreneurship in the Princeton area,\u201d said the Keller Center\u2019s director Sanjeev Kulkarni. \u201cThe Keller Center interacts with TigerLabs in various ways, and they are a terrific partner in helping to build the entrepreneurial ecosystem in and around Princeton.\u201d\n\nMore information on the TigerLabs Digital Health Boot Camp, which runs tomorrow through March 3, is available through the business website at www.tigerlabs.co.\n\nOn mobile or desktop:\n\n\u2022 Like Times of Trenton on Facebook\n\n\u2022 Follow @TimesofTrenton on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "'@times','princeton'", "title": "TigerLabs in Princeton to hold Digital Health Boot Camp, an intensive program for entrepreneurs", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"TigerLabs in Princeton to hold Digital Health Boot Camp, an intensive program for entrepreneurs\", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/mercer/index.ssf/2014/02/tigerlabs_in_princeton_to_digital_health_boot_camps_an_intensive_program_for_entrepreneurs.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/the-times/photo/2014/01/14162342-large.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"12164371\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-02-09T12:15:03Z\", \"author\": \"Wendy Plump | For The Times of Trenton\", \"tags\": [\"@times\",\"princeton\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.nj.com/the-times/photo/2014/01/14162342-small.jpg", "description": "Bill Zeruld, a health-care consultant who will be running the boot camp, said there are up to 97,000 apps on different technology platforms in the health-care space alone.", "card": "summary", "site": "@njdotcom"}, "article_date_updated": "Sunday, February 09, 2014,  7:15 AM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.nj.com/the-times/photo/2014/01/14162342-large.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"njottplump\", \"author_nickname\": \"Wendy Plump | For The Times of Trenton\", \"author_id\": \"8554906\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Mercer County\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.nj.com/mercer/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "NJ.com", "description": "Bill Zeruld, a health-care consultant who will be running the boot camp, said there are up to 97,000 apps on different technology platforms in the health-care space alone.", "title": "TigerLabs in Princeton to hold Digital Health Boot Camp, an intensive program for entrepreneurs", "url": "http://www.nj.com/mercer/index.ssf/2014/02/tigerlabs_in_princeton_to_digital_health_boot_camps_an_intensive_program_for_entrepreneurs.html", "image": "http://media.nj.com/design/alpha/img/logo_njo.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NJ.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Sunday, February 09, 2014,  7:10 AM", "article_author": "Wendy Plump | For The Times of Trenton", "Description": "Bill Zeruld, a health-care consultant who will be running the boot camp, said there are up to 97,000 apps on different technology platforms in the health-care space alone."}, "article_summary": "The group, TigerLabs, will hold the first of its Digital Health Boot Camps beginning tomorrow with an intensive, four-week, project-based program for entrepreneurs.\nFor example, a new direction for health care goes by the term \u201cremote monitoring,\u201d and involves the collection of personal health data by consumers for analysis by a variety of health care providers.\nThe boot camp is simply one of its opening salvos.\nThis is particularly true in the labyrinthine world of health care, according to a small group of Princeton-based venture capitalists who aim to change all that.\nThe boot camp will offer a broad survey of the health-care industry, including the roles of payers, providers, pharmaceutical companies, government agencies, consumers and other stakeholders in the digital health-care world."}
