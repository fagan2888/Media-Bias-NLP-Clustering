Who pays the bills for health care? Our dysfunctional health care system: we pay more for less For more Information\n\n(1) Feeding your fears by misrepresenting the government\u2019s liability\n\nWe face massive medical costs as the boomers retire, a burden that comprises the greater part of the Federal government\u2019s liabilities (obligations for future spending). Unpayable liabilities, used to terrorize Americans into cutting back vital parts of the social safety net (to maintain multi-generational low tax rates on the rich).\n\nEstimates of the Federal government\u2019s major liabilities, from the widely cited Debt Clock website (there are a wide range of estimates):\n\n$012.3 \u2014 Public Debt (from the US Treasury)\n\n$016.7 \u2014 Social Security liability\n\n$110.1 \u2014 Medicare liability\n\n\u201cThe Challenge of Rising Health Care Costs \u2014 A View from the Congressional Budget Office\u201c, Peter R. Orszag and Philip Ellis (Director and Senior Analyst of the CBO), New England Journal of Medicine, 1 November 2007 (gated) \u2014 Opening:\n\nThe long-term fiscal condition of the United States has been largely misdiagnosed. Despite all the attention paid to demographic challenges, such as the coming retirement of the baby-boom generation, our country\u2019s financial health will in fact be determined primarily by the growth rate of per capita health care costs.\n\nWe need not fear these liabilities. The actuaries of the Social Security Administration show that minor reforms can fund it. The Medicare liability could be lethal to the government\u2019s solvency. But all of our peers have health care systems more cost-effective than ours. Even gradual reform can make much of the Medicare liability disappear. Deep reforms could eliminate most of it.\n\nA substantial reform of our health care system could reduce the government\u2019s total liabilities to easily managed levels. Reducing health care costs by 1/4 is roughly equivalent to eliminating the entire public debt AND social security liability. And the US would still have the highest dollar spending per capital of any OECD nation.\n\n(2) The most important graph about America\n\nSee this graphic from OECD\u2019s Health at a Glance 2013, which has a wealth of information comparing our health care system to that of our peers. We spend roughly $2,000 per capita more on health care than our peers, and have roughly similar health care outcomes \u2014 and lower life expectancy at birth. We tremble in fear at a problem long-ago solved by other nations (although they seek further improvements).\n\nThese costs will fall, moving us to the left on this graph (lower cost/gp). Hopefully up and left (longer life at less cost/gdp); perhaps straight and left. But no matter how great the power of the health care industry, costs will come down. There is no excuse for not moving left and up, with so many proven superior systems to learn from (the complex mish-mash of ObamaCare demonstrates our dysfunctionality).\n\nThe people in the health care sectors have benefited from the multi-generational rise in costs. However costs fall, it will hurt many of them. Now let\u2019s look at the details of this our problem.\n\n(3) About US life expectancy\n\n.\n\nThe high US homicide rate depresses our average life expectancy at birth. We look a bit better in terms of average life expectancy at age 65. Graphic 8.2.1:\n\n.\n\n(4) How much do our peers spend for health care?\n\nA lot less than we do.\n\n.\n\n(5) Who pays the bills for health care?\n\nNote that the health care systems of our peers take various forms, most some kind of mixed public-private system.\n\n.\n\n(6) An example of our dysfunctional health care system: we pay more for less\n\n(a) We pay more for less health\n\n\u201cAnalyzing Whether Countries Are Equally Efficient at Improving Longevity for Men and Women\u201c, Douglas Barthold et al, American Journal of Public Health, in press.\n\nFor a summary of study see \u201cExpensive Healthcare Doesn\u2019t Help Americans Live Longer\u201d by Olga Khazan, the Atlantic, 13 December 2013 \u2014 Among developed countries, a new report says, the U.S. ranks very low in translating health dollars into longer lives \u2014 particularly for women\u201d\n\n(b) We pay more than anybody else for legal drugs. Although I\u2019ve not seen research on this, it\u2019s commonly said that the pharmaceutical industry earns roughly 3/4 of its profits in the US. No surprise as Federal law prohibits Medicare from negotiating volume discounts (as the Vet and Medicaid programs do). Graph from 7.4.1 from the OECD report:\n\n.\n\n(b) The doctors\u2019 cartel keeps the numbers of doctors low, their compensation high, and works to restrict use of alternatives (e.g., nurse practitioners) \u2014 vs our peers. Classic monopolistic practice, working their magic to produce more income.\n\nFewer doctors than our peers \u2026\n\n.\n\n\u2026 so our doctors get paid more.
