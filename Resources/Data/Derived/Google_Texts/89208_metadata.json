Roberts is one of the court\u2019s conservative justices, but has been the deciding vote in past cases, including when the Supreme Court upheld the Affordable Care Act as constitutional.\n\nOne tough take from Roberts came when the Court\u2019s chief justice said pro-gay marriage advocates are \u201cnot seeking to join the institution, you\u2019re seeking to change what the institution is.\u201d\n\nAnd while Roberts acknowledged \u201chow quickly\u201d society has accepted same sex marriage \u2014 with state after state authorizing gay marriages and public opinion favoring legalizing same-sex marriage \u2014 he also said that a Court decision could close the debate and close minds.\n\nSteve Vladeck, a constitutional law professor at American University and CNN analyst, said Tuesday\u2019s session revealed few surprises to close observers of the court who have expected Kennedy and Roberts would be the swing votes on this case.\n\n\u201cWe heard both of them in the arguments today showing support for both sides of the argument, showing skepticism for both sides of the argument,\u201d Vladeck said. \u201cI think the headline here is it\u2019s about what we expected. It\u2019s going to be close, it\u2019s going to be divisive and it\u2019s going to come down to Kennedy and Roberts.\u201d\n\nVladeck also cautioned against reading too much into the justices\u2019 questioning and comments during the oral arguments, which account for just a few hours in the multi-month process of deciding such an consequential case.\n\nLawyers and justices also debated whether same-sex marriage should be decided by the courts or left to the people via ballot, the method preferred by conservatives who argue states should be allowed to ban same-sex unions.\n\nBut Justice Sonia Sotomayor, a liberal on the Court, took that argument and flipped it \u2014 arguing that people should be allowed to decide on same-sex marriage simply by deciding who they want to marry.\n\nThe emotion of the case also flooded into the courtroom, as one protester seated inside began shouted and screaming in the middle of the arguments.\n\n\u201cIf you support gay marriage you will burn in hell,\u201d the protester shouted before police quickly detained the man and dragged him out of the courtroom while he continued to scream.\n\n\u201cRather refreshing actually,\u201d conservative Justice Antonin Scalia quipped as the man was dragged out to laughter in the courtroom.\n\nLawyers with the pro-gay marriage organization Lambda Legal, which represented two of the cases wrapped into the Supreme Court case \u201can awe-inspiring and singular moment in the march towards justice.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was incredibly moving to gather in the Supreme Court chamber with their parents and all 30 plaintiffs in these historic cases. Mary and Doug were fantastic, making a compelling and to my mind irrefutable case on their behalf,\u201d Lambda Legal\u2019s Alphonse Gerhardstein said of the lawyers who argued in favor of same-sex marriage before the Court on Tuesday.\n\nU.S. Solicitor General Donald Verrilli, who represented the Obama administration\u2019s views, also presented arguments in favor of same-sex marriage, focusing on equal protection under the 14th amendment and likening bans on same-sex marriage to handing second-class status to gay Americans.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why we would repeat history,\u201d he said.\n\nJohn Bursch, who argued the states\u2019 claim that the courts should not overturn bans on same-sex marriage, told the justices Tuesday that the decision should be left up to the political and democratic process.\n\nBursch also argued that making same-sex marriage a constitutional right would change the meaning of marriage and impact the interest of states in furthering the institution of marriage to encourage procreation.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Supreme Court justices appeared divided Tuesday, April 28, 2015, during historic arguments over the constitutionality of gay marriage.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=339570924", "og": {"site_name": "WQAD.com", "description": "Supreme Court justices appeared divided Tuesday, April 28, 2015, during historic arguments over the constitutionality of gay marriage.", "title": "Supreme Court justices appear skeptical of redefining marriage", "url": "http://wqad.com/2015/04/28/supreme-court-justices-appear-skeptical-of-redefining-marriage/", "image": {"width": 200, "identifier": "http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2882036417f6cd8ccaa6f6a7d2c6eaae?s=200&ts=1464224522", "height": 200}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2882036417f6cd8ccaa6f6a7d2c6eaae?s=240", "site": "@mytwitterhandle", "card": "summary", "creator": "@mytwitterhandle"}, "keywords": "news, same-sex marriage", "p": {"domain_verify": "93c0125b6e5dd793b0f306c174977ff3"}, "fb": {"pages": 32869603490}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "application-name": "WQAD.com", "google-site-verification": "oCyrEMhIYdAYe44exrSiY6lwtVx417KNhwh2t4d9nwM", "msvalidate.01": "9CC50DB4C5614EA88B5CFA75E33AAB02", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/wqad8", "published_time": "2015-04-28T19:27:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-28T19:27:10+00:00", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/wqad8"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://wqad.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2882036417f6cd8ccaa6f6a7d2c6eaae?s=16"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfb48\"", "article_summary": "Bursch also argued that making same-sex marriage a constitutional right would change the meaning of marriage and impact the interest of states in furthering the institution of marriage to encourage procreation.\nOn the anti-gay marriage side, Kennedy pointed out that for \u201cmillenia\u201d the definition of marriage has been between a man and a woman, and called efforts to legalize same-sex marriage a redefinition of that institution.\nWASHINGTON (CNN) \u2014 Supreme Court justices appeared divided Tuesday, April 28, 2015, during historic arguments over the constitutionality of gay marriage, with Justice Anthony Kennedy returning to a familiar role as the court\u2019s pivotal vote.\nMany questions on Tuesday centered around the definition of marriage and whether the decision to authorize or ban gay marriage should be left to voters in individual states or decided by the judicial system.\nKennedy, often the bench\u2019s swing vote, showed his arguments in favor and against legalizing same-sex marriage as he questioned both the plaintiff and the defense."}
