(Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post)\n\nThe millions of gallons of oil that spilled from BP\u2019s Deepwater Horizon well forced the company to pay billions of dollars in fines and to plead guilty to manslaughter. But in the database used by federal agencies to review contractors\u2019 work, there is not a single negative review of the company, a congressional review found.\n\nSen. Claire McCaskill\u2019s staff also found that CGI Federal, which built the troubled federal health-care exchange, is ranked as exceptional, even though the Obama administration ended its contract and found a replacement company to complete the work.\n\nAt a Senate subcommittee hearing Thursday, McCaskill (D-Mo.) cited both of those examples as embarrassments that illustrate how poorly the federal government reviews contractors\u2019 work history. The system, she said, is \u201cshockingly old and clunky\u201d and incomplete because even egregious missteps go unreported by officials who would rather not have to deal with the fallout of posting a negative review about a company.\n\n\u201cInformation about past performance and integrity is scanty, and what there is can be scattered across multiple databases,\u201d McCaskill said during a hearing by the subcommittee on financial and contracting oversight. \u201cReports can be difficult to find or just plain wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s weird to me that a contracting officer using a non-\n\npublic database would have less complete information about a contractor\u2019s performance than somebody who just Googled them,\u201d she said.\n\nFederal officials told the committee that they have made great strides in compiling information on contractors\u2019 past performance and improving training so that evaluations of contractors are objective and accurate.\n\n\u201cIt is an issue that is taken seriously,\u201d said Kevin Youel Page of the U.S. General Services Administration. \u201cThere are known improvements that are underway in terms of getting the quality and timeliness of reports up.\u201d\n\nThe goal, he said, is to \u201cmitigate the risk to government of entering into business with a vendor that is not capable or less capable of doing the work.\u201d\n\nBut he said there are \u201cno doubt miles to go.\u201d\n\nOfficials from the Office of Management and Budget were also invited to testify, but they did not show in what McCaskill called a \u201cwillful disregard of legitimate government oversight.\u201d\n\nFrank Benenati, an OMB spokesman, said that no one was available to testify because of the president\u2019s budget release this week but that the administration \u201cbelieves strong financial and contracting oversight is critical.\u201d\n\nMichael Fischetti, the executive director of the National Contract Management Association, said in an interview that the problem has been around for years, and despite efforts to fix the system, it still can\u2019t be counted on.\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t reliable, quite frankly,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd past performance should be one of the most important criteria in most cases.\u201d\n\nBut Jim McCarthy, owner of AOC Key Solutions, which helps companies win contracts, said that often the quality of the employees matters most.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what the company\u2019s background is as much as the team the company has assembled,\u201d he said.\n\nMcCaskill said the problem stems in large part from a reluctance by federal agencies to report when a contractor falls short.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost like if a contracting evaluator gives negative information, they know they are going to get blowback from the contractor, right? And so it\u2019s easier not to,\u201d she said. \u201cWe let things slide because it\u2019s too hard to fight it.\u201d\n\nShe said her staff could not find any negative reports in the database for BP, which has been suspended from receiving federal contracts. And she said that the most recent assessment for CGI Federal ranked it as exceptional.\n\n\u201cMajor screw-up \u2014 that\u2019s probably all you needed to put in there,\u201d she said. \u201cThe notion that there is no negative information about CGI Federal or the subsidiaries of BP in [the database] is embarrassing.\u201d\n\nBP declined to comment.
