Unlike Trump, he was neither paranoid, perfidious nor vicious and, despite our big disagreements with him on policy (hello, Planned Parenthood), it was clear that he understood that being president actually is about, you know, the country \u2014 unlike Trump, who behaves as if it\u2019s all about him, not to mention his pathological need to convince himself his hands are really big as a way of masking what apparently is a severe sex problem.\n\nGovernment 101: Kasich\u2019s notion of leadership, based on experience in Congress and as chief executive of a large, diverse state, appeared to be rooted in the world we live in, which is to say the real world. Trump appears to have skipped Social Studies class on the day the teacher talked about the Separation of Powers, and his insistence that he, Trump, will solve the nation\u2019s problems owes less to Adams, Jefferson and Madison than to Mussolini, Kim Il-Sung and Attila the Hun.\n\nCompromise: Kasich, although a soldier in the Gingrich Revolution, not only allowed the essential importance of the federal government in shaping domestic policy, the economy and providing a social safety net, but also acknowledged the need to account for \u2014 and even accommodate! \u2014 viewpoints different than his own. Trump by contrast not only believes he has all the answers, despite his massive ignorance of the complexities and issues he would face as president, but also presumes that browbeating, intimidation and force are the paramount tools of politics, the logical culmination, evolutionary consequence and most monstrous mutation of every hot-shot corporate executive who recklessly thinks politics is just a second-rate form of business.\n\nAs E.J. Dionne wrote in his recently published and essential \u201cWhy the Right Went Wrong,\u201d Kasich was the closest thing to a serious-minded conservative reformer in the Republican race:\n\nA partial exception was Governor John Kasich, In the Republicans\u2019 first debate in August 2015, he was willing to break with party orthodoxy by offering an unambiguous defense of his push to have Ohio accept an expansion of Medicare under the Affordable Care Act. He offered a stirring defense of the interests of the working poor and seemed, for a moment at least, to be the incarnation of a compassionate conservative coming back to life. In late October, Kasich excoriated his party\u2019s moves rightward on issues ranging from Medicare and Medicaid to the flat tax. \u201cWhat has happened to our party,\u201d he asked. \u201cWhat has happened to the conservative movement?\u201d\n\nGuess we\u2019ll find out, governor.\n\nP.S.
