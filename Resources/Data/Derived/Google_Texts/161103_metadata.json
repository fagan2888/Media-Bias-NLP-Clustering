Mitchell is on fire:\n\nBut the larger point, Congressman Duffy, is these mini CR s\u2013 mini continuing resolutions \u2014 that\u2019s the whole question of taking little pieces of the government. The issue is not that this is a small matter, it\u2019s a very big matter, but so is the matter of the kids in Head Start. So is the problem of the single moms who aren\u2019t getting food stamps and aren\u2019t getting their help. So down the road are the survivors benefits and that fund is going to run out in weeks if not months. So you can\u2019t take this piecemeal, Congressman. Isn\u2019t the issue that someone has to sit down and figure out what to do about the stalemate that has led to this disgrace?\u2026.\n\nAfter Duffy filibusters about Obamacare for a few minutes, Mitchell jumps in:\n\nWith all due respect, this is about military death benefits to kids, 19-year-old kids who died in Afghanistan and who are not returning home, this is about what their families are entitled to by law and what they are not getting. This is not about what you want in Obamacare and not about what the president wants on the debt ceiling.\n\nSnap!\n\nMitchell should have asked Duffy when was the last time he went to the \u201cessential\u201d House gym.\n\nThe fun begins at 6:45 into the video:", "article_metadata": {"description": "NBC's Andrea Mitchell destroys GOP Congressman Sean Duffy over the GOP shutdown now denying death benefits to the families of US troops killed in action.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "AMERICAblog News", "description": "NBC's Andrea Mitchell destroys GOP Congressman Sean Duffy over the GOP shutdown now denying death benefits to the families of US troops killed in action.", "title": "Andrea Mitchell burns GOP Rep. over denial of death benefits to troops", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://americablog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/sean-duffy-200x128.jpg", "updated_time": "2013-10-08T23:10:09-04:00", "url": "http://americablog.com/2013/10/andrea-mitchell-fire-roasts-gop-congressman-denial-death-benefits-us-troops.html", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "NBC's Andrea Mitchell destroys GOP Congressman Sean Duffy over the GOP shutdown now denying death benefits to the families of US troops killed in action.", "creator": "@aravosis", "image": "http://americablog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/andrea-mitchell-sean-duffy.jpg", "title": "Andrea Mitchell burns GOP Rep. over denial of death benefits to troops", "site": "@americablog", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "p": {"domain_verify": "6a65cadbb06b6a8cd2795a412c36d6b4"}, "fb": {"admins": 504024627}, "google-site-verification": "LrdwJVMR_suty6YsOZ4xc1Hv3-F8Ms0Wo-VhCAoXm_U", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/AMERICAblog", "published_time": "2013-10-09T08:00:49-04:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/aravosis", "section": "News", "modified_time": "2013-10-08T23:10:09-04:00", "tag": "Video"}, "news_keywords": "Andrea Mitchell, death benefits, government shutdown, gratuity, health care reform, military, Obamacare, Sean Duffy, Video"}, "article_summary": "You have to give credit to Duffy for one thing: He makes clear during the seven-minute interview that the entire shutdown is about Obamacare, Obamacare, Obamacare.\nMitchell is on fire:But the larger point, Congressman Duffy, is these mini CR s\u2013 mini continuing resolutions \u2014 that\u2019s the whole question of taking little pieces of the government.\nMitchell should have asked Duffy when was the last time he went to the \u201cessential\u201d House gym.\nSo down the road are the survivors benefits and that fund is going to run out in weeks if not months.\nSo is the problem of the single moms who aren\u2019t getting food stamps and aren\u2019t getting their help."}
