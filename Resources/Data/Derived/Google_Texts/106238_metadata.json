The marked followers, who wore name tags identifying their employers on the orange cords, were ubiquitous at the annual winter meeting of the National Governors Association (NGA). They could also be found huddled over restaurant tables with the state leaders, or cozied up next to officials on lobby sofas. More would tug on gubernatorial sleeves at the private receptions and in the hallways of the conference center.\n\n\n\nThe interlopers were officially called \u201ccorporate fellows\u201d in the lingo of the event, but most Americans would probably just recognize them better as lobbyists\u2014well-paid ear-benders working to place their clients\u2019 interests before the state\u2019s most powerful elected leader. They form the backbone of the policy arm of the NGA, which has played a role in crafting some of the most significant bipartisan policy solutions in the nation\u2019s history, like the now-fraught Common Core education standards. And their constant presence was one of the few unifying presences at an organization increasingly riven by partisan divisions.\n\nBut in recent years, governors and staff say, even the constant presence of influence peddlers has begun to wear on the members of the NGA, as the organization has lost influence, driven by concerns about a slow-moving organization and growing polarization among the governors, who increasingly favor party-specific Governor gatherings.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lobbyist-fest,\u201d said the chief of staff to one governor of the NGA. \u201cAnd worse yet, the organization isn\u2019t accountable to anyone.\u201d\n\nIn recent years, both the Democratic and Republican Governors Associations, known by the acronyms DGA and RGA, have built out their policy teams, as both parties\u2019 governors have become more ideologically polarized. They view the NGA as a bloated bureaucracy\u2014it still uses triplicate copy paper for on-site registrations\u2014that produces few results, or worse, policies they don\u2019t support. Republican governors have been saddled by the organization\u2019s role in framing Common Core, while Democratic governors have bristled at the organization\u2019s more GOP-friendly positions on immigration and healthcare.\n\n\u201cThe most valuable commodity any governor has is their time,\u201d said former RGA Executive Director Phil Cox. \u201cThey have to ask the question, \u2018What are we getting out of this?\u2019 At RGA and DGA, it is pretty clear. Their time and engagement results in substantial and effective political and policy support. At NGA, it is less clear. In recent years, it is difficult to point to substantive bipartisan accomplishments.\u201d\n\nSince Common Core, the group\u2019s policy initiatives have faded in ambition and significance. This year\u2019s chair\u2019s initiative, called \u201cDelivering Results,\u201d focused on boosting government efficiency, while one of the group\u2019s key legislative priorities is passing the so-called Marketplace Fairness Act, which would allow states to charge sale tax on Internet purchases.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not competitors with RGA and DGA,\u201d said NGA Deputy Director David Quam, who said the group has \u201ca very active agenda this year.\u201d \u201cTheir job is to get governors elected. Our job is to help bring them together and come to policy positions that can really solve issues at the state level and the federal level. We\u2019re probably more relevant now than ever because all the action\u2019s in the states.\u201d\n\nAccording to a spokesperson, last year, the organization held more than 80 meetings in states with nearly 3,100 state officials on issues such as economic development, education, health care and governance.\n\nFormer Texas Gov. Rick Perry pulled his state out of the organization more than a decade ago, and has been followed by Ohio Gov. John Kasich, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, Florida Gov. Rick Scott, and others. Democrats, like former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley, have considered quitting the organization, but have yet to take the leap. Dues-paying New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has never attended a session, according to fellow governors, while California\u2019s Gov. Jerry Brown has frequently skipped the meetings. Quam called the trend \u201cold news.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe biggest thing keeping governors engaged in NGA is a sense that they want to support their colleagues who are in leadership,\u201d said a person close to Democratic governors.\n\nThe NGA considers all governors members in their organization by virtue of their election, even if they\u2019ve decided against paying dues. Governors are charged membership in the organization based on the population size of their states, with the largest states paying more than $175,000 before travel costs are added. The money is usually paid out of a governor\u2019s budget, funds they could use to hire additional staff or use for other initiatives.\n\nThe annual Washington conference is the more business heavy of the two meetings a year. The summer gathering, which rotates around the country, includes leisure activities. In 2013 in Milwaukee, governors were offered the chance to ride to the Harley Davidson museum on motorcycles as part of a motorcade with veterans, and were treated to a fireworks display over Lake Michigan after a fancy dinner reception. The 2014 meeting in Nashville featured a performance by country music star Carrie Underwood and a private reception at the Country Music Hall of Fame.\n\nOne former senior DGA official called the group \u201cthe spleen of political organizations.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re infuriated when a Governor pops their mouth off about something \u2018political,\u2019 but then turn around and do politically insane things like sell access to Governors to Chinese government officials,\u201d the operative said, referencing the 2011 meeting which brought together Chinese governors at an event at the Chinese embassy in Washington. The 2015 meeting included a reception at the Canadian embassy.\n\nAccording to the event program, 122 companies were represented as corporate fellows at this meeting, including Bank of America, IBM, McKinsey & Company, and UPS.\n\nThe ostensible reason for the meetings\u2014convening governors to share ideas and best practices\u2014is often fleeting. In the corner of the main meeting room, a large case contains name cards for the 55 governors from the states and U.S. territories. But most never leave the box. Few governors attend the public sessions, where issues like healthcare, education, and cyber-security are discussed, instead taking meetings with reporters, donors, or the orange-lanyards interest group representatives. Some registered attendees, like New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, didn\u2019t attend a single open committee session this weekend.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no venue quite like this,\u201d boasted one corporate government affairs executive. \u201cI have meetings with governors stacked up all day.\u201d\n\nQuam said he\u2019s not surprised by the corporate interest in NGA, saying it\u2019s a sign that the states are actually getting things done. \u201cThey complain that we don\u2019t give them enough access all the time,\u201d he said of the fellows. The NGA maintains that committee session attendance has been \u201cexcellent,\u201d noting that only 8-10 governors serve on each committee.\n\nAlongside the conferences are gatherings of the RGA and DGA, much of whose unlimited fundraising comes from the same corporate fellows who fill the coffers of the NGA. On Saturday night, the DGA threw its annual Taste of the America gala at the Mayflower hotel for its donors. The RGA\u2019s Executive Roundtable huddled Friday with the governors, with an address by former Vice President Dick Cheney.\n\nBut the NGA organizers try hard to keep try to keep the partisanship out of the main conference center, sometimes to no avail. Closed-door luncheons of governors in recent years have frequented partisan spats over the Affordable Care Act or immigration policy.\n\nLast year\u2019s press conference following a private meeting with President Barack Obama devolved into a partisan smack-down between Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and Connecticut Gov. Dan Malloy. The capstone of the weekend, the annual governor\u2019s dinner at the White House, isn\u2019t even an official NGA event. Hosted by the President and First Lady, all governors are invited to the black tie dinner, as well as to the business meeting with the president set for Monday morning.", "article_metadata": {"description": "For three days, the National Governors Association scurried with their security details down swanky hotel hallways in Washington", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "Influence-brokers descend on a gathering of state chiefs", "title": "Lobbyists Get Face Time With America's Governors", "url": "http://time.com/3717941/national-governors-association/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/rtr4qnpf.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/rtr4qnpf.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "description": "Influence-brokers descend on a gathering of state chiefs", "site": "TIME", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Lobbyists Get Face Time With America's Governors"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "democratic governors association, governors, national governors association, republican governors association, states, barack obama", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time", "author": "https://facebook.com/zekejmiller"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "democratic governors association, governors, national governors association, republican governors association, States, Barack Obama"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd21c6\"", "article_summary": "And their constant presence was one of the few unifying presences at an organization increasingly riven by partisan divisions.\n\u201cThey have to ask the question, \u2018What are we getting out of this?\u2019 At RGA and DGA, it is pretty clear.\nLast year\u2019s press conference following a private meeting with President Barack Obama devolved into a partisan smack-down between Louisiana Gov.\nThe NGA considers all governors members in their organization by virtue of their election, even if they\u2019ve decided against paying dues.\nThe capstone of the weekend, the annual governor\u2019s dinner at the White House, isn\u2019t even an official NGA event."}
