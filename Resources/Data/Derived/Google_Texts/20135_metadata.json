But this \u2018transparent\u2019 administration can\u2019t tell you the truth about its signature piece of legislation. That irony is just rich to me.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "Congressman Trey Gowdy (R., S.C.) said the series of embarrassing statements from Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber should continue to flow uninterrupted\u00a0because they reveal the true deceptive natu", "title": "Trey Gowdy: Gruber an \u2018Insomniac with Tourette\u2019s Syndrome\u2019", "url": "http://freebeacon.com/politics/trey-gowdy-gruber-an-insomniac-with-tourettes-syndrome/", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/freebeacon.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@freebeacon", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/freebeacon.png", "description": "Congressman Trey Gowdy (R., S.C.) said the series of embarrassing statements from Obamacare architec", "card": "summary", "title": "Trey Gowdy: Gruber an \u2018Insomniac with Tourette\u2019s Syndrome\u2019"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1047859882", "fb": {"app_id": "FB_APP_ID"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd91f2\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWhen you have an insomniac with Tourette\u2019s syndrome, you don\u2019t interrupt him,\u201d Gowdy told Fox\u2019s Greta Van Susteren on Wednesday.\nBY:Congressman Trey Gowdy (R., S.C.) said the series of embarrassing statements from Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber should continue to flow uninterrupted because they reveal the true deceptive nature of President Obama\u2019s unpopular health care law.\nBut this \u2018transparent\u2019 administration can\u2019t tell you the truth about its signature piece of legislation.\n\u201cIf I could get past the irony, I would get to the arrogance.\n'\u201d Gowdy said."}
