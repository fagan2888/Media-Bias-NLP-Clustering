The U.S. Ski Team will send six moguls skiers and three aerials athletes to Sochi. The U.S. Olympic Freestyle Team will be led by reigning Olympic champion Hannah Kearney, who has won three World Cup contests this season, followed by Montana’s Heather McPhie and Connecticut’s Eliza Outtrim. Vail’s Heidi Kloser, the daughter of vaunted endurance champion Mike Kloser, is joining the U.S. moguls roster.

Kloser, who was told by coaches to prepare for Sochi late Monday, said she was trying not to focus on the Olympics in the final three Olympic-qualifying World Cup contests earlier this month.

“I was really just focused on my skiing. I wasn’t focused on making the team. I just wanted to ski like I know how to ski and the results would follow,” said the 21-year-old. The results did arrive. Kloser’s second-place finish at the World Cup on Tuesday at Lake Placid supercharged her chances for Sochi.

She’s going to keep the same strategy heading onto the biggest stage of her career.

“I want to treat it like any other event. I know it’s going to be different. It will definitely be a different story. But the program will be the same. Two jumps and moguls. I can do that,” she said.

Olympic veteran Patrick Deneen will join Montana’s Bradley Wilson as the two men’s moguls skiers competing for the U.S. in Sochi. Olympic-tested women’s aerials skiers Ashley Caldwell of Virginia and Emily Cook of Massachusetts will join solo men’s aerials skier — and USSA rookie of the year — Mac Bohonnon of Connecticut from the U.S. Aerials Team.
