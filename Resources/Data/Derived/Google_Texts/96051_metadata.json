General Assembly last week. \u201cThe violence engulfing the region today has made too many Israelis ready to abandon the hard work of peace. And that\u2019s something worthy of reflection within Israel,\u201d he said at the U.N.\n\nIn addition to Israel\u2019s relations with Palestinians, Obama and Netanyahu said they would discuss the international coalition against Islamic State militants, also referred to as ISIS, in the Middle East and international nuclear talks with Iran, which faces a looming deadline.\n\n\u201cIsrael fully supports your efforts and your leadership to defeat ISIS. We think everybody should support it,\u201d Netanyahu said. \u201cEven more critical is our shared goal is preventing Iran from becoming a military nuclear power.\u201d\n\nNetanyahu and Israeli officials have expressed concern in recent weeks that Western powers will make concessions to Iran in talks to gain its support in the battle against Islamic State.\n\n\u201cThe Islamic Republic is now trying to bamboozle its way to an agreement that will remove the sanctions it still faces and leave it with a capacity of thousands of...centrifuges to enrich uranium. This would effectively cement Iran\u2019s place as a threshold military nuclear power,\u201d he said earlier this week at the U.N.\n\nTehran insists that it is pursuing nuclear capabilities for peaceful aims.\n\nThe U.S. and Israeli leaders last met in March, while the Israelis and Palestinians were still involved in a U.S.-mediated peace process. Those talks ultimately dissolved without an agreement.\n\nMore from MarketWatch", "article_metadata": {"lifp_basePath": "https://id.marketwatch.com/access", "twitter": {"site": {"id": 624413}, "domain": "marketwatch.com", "image": {"width": 1320, "identifier": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-CV431_obama__ZG_20141001133911.jpg", "height": 742}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "President Barack Obama on Wednesday called on Israel\u2019s prime minister to help shake up the status quo with Palestinians as the sides seek to find a more lasting peace in the region."}, "article.content_group": "marketwatch", "parsely-author": "Jeffrey Sparshott And Felicia Schwartz", "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-pub-date": "2014-10-01T13:41:00-04:00", "parsely-link": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/obama-calls-on-netanyahu-to-help-shake-up-mideast-peace-process-2014-10-01", "author": "Jeffrey Sparshott And Felicia Schwartz", "parsely-title": "Obama calls on Netanyahu to help \u2018shake up\u2019 Mideast peace process", "description": "President Barack Obama on Wednesday called on Israel\u2019s prime minister to help shake up the status quo with Palestinians as the sides seek to find a more lasting peace in the region.", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=336693422", "article.section": "Economy & Politics", "page.site": "marketwatch", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 283204329838}, "parsely-section": "MW_Economy & Politics", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "og": {"site_name": "MarketWatch", "description": "President Barack Obama on Wednesday called on Israel\u2019s prime minister to help shake up the status quo with Palestinians as the sides seek to find a more lasting peace in the region.", "title": "Obama calls on Netanyahu to help \u2018shake up\u2019 Mideast peace process", "url": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/obama-calls-on-netanyahu-to-help-shake-up-mideast-peace-process-2014-10-01", "image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-CV431_obama__ZG_20141001133911.jpg", "type": "article"}, "ob": {"image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-CV431_obama__ZG_20141001133911.jpg"}, "article.id": "7BA20E40-4991-11E4-BFB5-20F1C7E2E4FC", "position": 1}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd10a0\"", "article_summary": "U.S. efforts to broker peace between Israelis and Palestinians have faltered, and Obama again challenged Israel during remarks to the U.N.
