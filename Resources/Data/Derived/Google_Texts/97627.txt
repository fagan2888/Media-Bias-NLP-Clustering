Slowly but steadily, area clinics and hospitals are turning to apps to schedule patients.

Apps like ZocDoc and InQuicker are tapping into increased competition among urgent care centers and pharmacy clinics.

“Patients cancel their appointments with doctors nearly a quarter of the time, and what we're doing is, we integrate to all the different systems that doctors have,” CEO and founder of ZocDoc Cyrus Massoui said. “There (are) 1,400 different systems out there. Any time there is a last-minute cancellation for one of our doctors, that gets fed to the Internet."

Medical professionals pay to be part of the app database, and there’s a payoff. If a doctor can tighten up scheduling, he or she may get a better review from the patient and more Medicare reimbursements.

"The Affordable Care Act is looking at managing patient populations,” Jersey City Medical Center Operations Chief Kirat Kharode said. “So the ability to create access points into our system is critical in getting patients to use our system and use our services."

The apps allow the customer to shop around and find a clinic ready to accept patients immediately.

“At the end of the day, it was definitely worth it, because I spent far less time in the car driving out there than I would have in the waiting room,” InQuicker user Lauren Toth said.

The apps will list insurance carriers, letting the customer decide immediately if the doctor is in and affordable.
