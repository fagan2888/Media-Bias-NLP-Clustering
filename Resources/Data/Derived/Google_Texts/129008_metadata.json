When spinning, the dowel hangs by the yarn coming off the top and is spun in a clockwise direction.\n\nAs the spindle turns, loose fibers are pulled into the twisting wool, caught up in the twist and wound into the strand of yarn.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not difficult,\u201d Clary said. \u201cBut, it does take a little bit of getting used to.\u201d\n\nEventually, Clary would like to have a spinning wheel to use for her fiber arts. A friend has one that breaks down into the size of a backpack.\n\nDrop spindles were used back in medieval times to get children started spinning, but it\u2019s also small enough to take places, unlike a wheel.\n\n\u201cAbout 6, 7, they would learn on a drop spindle. I was about 6 or 7 when I learned on the drop spindle,\u201d Clary said. \u201cThe drop spindle\u2019s wonderful because you can take it on the go and as you\u2019re waiting around, you can get quite a bit of work done.\u201d\n\nClary has used her yarn to make hats, lucite cord and inkel, material called that because it\u2019s woven on an inkel loom.\n\nThe inkel can then be used as a belt or a table runner or a blanket.\n\nThe dark purple yarn that Clary has been spinning will probably end up as socks, she said.\n\n\u201c(Spinning) is a fun craft on its own that leads to other crafts,\u201d Clary said.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Kodiak (Alaska) Daily Mirror, http://www.kodiakdailymirror.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Most people don't think about where their clothes come from, but members of the Society for Creative Anachronism, who re-enact medieval lifestyles, know it takes a lot of work to get from raw fibers to clothing.", "Author": "JULIE HERMANN", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Most people don\u2019t think about where their clothes come from, but members of the Society for Creative Anachronism, who re-enact medieval lifestyles, know it takes a lot of work to get from raw fibers to clothing.", "title": "Group spins wool in part of medieval re-enactment", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/apr/26/group-spins-wool-in-part-of-medieval-re-enactment/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/23/b53b02840a016912740f6a7067002ddc.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/23/b53b02840a016912740f6a7067002ddc.jpg", "title": "Group spins wool in part of medieval re-enactment", "description": "Most people don't think about where their clothes come from, but members of the Society for Creative Anachronism, who re-enact medieval lifestyles, know it takes a lot of work to get from raw fibers t", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe077e\"", "article_summary": "Members of the local SCA group this month held a hands-on day for learning about arts and sciences of the medieval ages, including spinning wool into yarn.\nI was about 6 or 7 when I learned on the drop spindle,\u201d Clary said.\n\u201cAbout 6, 7, they would learn on a drop spindle.\nDrop spindles were used back in medieval times to get children started spinning, but it\u2019s also small enough to take places, unlike a wheel.\nClary has worked with raw wool given to her straight off the sheep before, but for Saturday\u2019s spinning, she used already combed and dyed wool from Kodiak\u2019s local fiber arts shop, The Rookery."}
