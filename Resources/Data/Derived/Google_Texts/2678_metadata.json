The group went on to reject the university\u2019s proposed solution, which it claims \u201cdoes not adequately address the magnitude of the issues at hand,\u201d and also included a list of additional demands, setting a deadline of Aug. 25 for MU to respond.\n\nThe university replied to the group Friday through the Office of the Chancellor, saying it would temporarily reverse its decision and restore health insurance subsidies for the balance of the academic year, but that the students\u2019 other demands would be handled through the normal process of \u201cshared governance\u201d in consultation with student representatives.\n\nNonetheless, the Graduate Professional Council (GPC) and Graduate Student Association (GSA) reiterated the FGR\u2019s demands\u2014which include higher annual stipend increases for graduate student employees, the construction of new graduate student housing, and a university-supported child care facility\u2014in an open letter to students and administrators Saturday, lending their implicit support to the protest movement.\n\n\u201cIt is not clear that shared governance mechanisms are adequately equipped to address the specific issues at hand,\u201d the letter contends, arguing that the administration has outsized influence in the process bolstered by \u201cdecades of experience working within a bureaucracy\u201d and claiming that previous efforts to address student grievances through shared governance have failed to produce an \u201cadequate solution.\u201d\n\nChristian Basi, Associate Director of the MU News Bureau, told Campus Reform that the university could not confirm whether any classes have officially been cancelled, but that any such cancellations would be a matter for department heads to take up with individual professors.\n\nBasi also referred Campus Reform to a statement from Dr. Hank Foley, Senior Vice Chancellor for Research, Graduate Studies, and Economic Development, responding to the walkout on a more general level:\n\n\u201cBe at the Columns at noontime tomorrow [Aug. 26] to express gratitude and support for our graduate students and to celebrate the central roles that they play in teaching, scholarship, research, and the life of the mind at MU!\u201d the statement said.\n\nFollow the author of this article on Twitter: @FrickePete", "article_metadata": {"category": "News",
