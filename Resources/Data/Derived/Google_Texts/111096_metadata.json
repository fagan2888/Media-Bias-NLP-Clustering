Bracy is the executive director of the Rhode Island State Right to Life Committee, a small nonprofit that doesn\u2019t offer health insurance plans for employees, requiring workers to purchase their own. Bracy had a family policy through Anthem BlueCross BlueShield, which did not cover abortion, and hoped to keep the coverage once the Affordable Care Act (ACA) became law in 2012. Initially, due to ACA effects on private insurance companies, the Bracys\u2019 premium shot up $70 per month to almost $500. Then in October 2013, Anthem informed the family that in order to meet ACA requirements, the plan would be canceled, according to the lawsuit.\n\nBracy discovered he could purchase a new plan similar to the previous one through Anthem\u2019s participation in the state healthcare exchange. It had a shockingly low sticker price: less than $3 per month, after applicable subsidies for which the family qualified. But the prospect of recovering $497 in the family\u2019s monthly budget collapsed when the enrollment counselor would not reveal whether or not the insurance plan covered elective abortions. After further research, Bracy discovered all plans on the Connecticut exchange included elective abortion coverage.\n\nWe see you\u2019ve been enjoying the content on our exclusive member website.

But the ACA includes a directive for insurance providers to \u201ccollect from each enrollee in the plan (without regard to the enrollee\u2019s age, sex, or family status) a separate payment\u201d to cover elective abortions. The monthly allocation is supposed to be set aside into a special fund the provider uses to pay for the procedures. States may opt-out or limit elective abortion coverage in some or all of their plans, according to their own abortion laws. All exchanges are required to offer at least one plan that does not cover elective abortions, according to a report from the Government Accountability Office. But the report revealed five states\u2014Connecticut, Rhode Island, New Jersey, Vermont, and Hawaii\u2014only offered plans with the coverage.\n\nBracy, a deacon in the Roman Catholic church, had three options: purchase a new policy through private insurance that would double the family\u2019s already high premium; violate his beliefs and buy a policy through the exchange; or go without health insurance altogether, giving up his subsidy and risking fines. Instead, he sued the Obama administration for violating his family\u2019s First Amendment rights and the Religious Freedom and Restoration Act.\n\nOn Nov. 19, Bracy voluntarily dropped the lawsuit after Connecticut officials announced they would add two plans with no elective abortion coverage. Information about which plans cover elective abortions and which don\u2019t will be posted on the state exchange\u2019s website. Officials also promised to train representatives on all the options so they can advise customers, the dismissal notice said.\n\nAlthough pro-lifers now have options in Connecticut, four states still require all people enrolling in the healthcare exchange to chip in for others\u2019 elective abortions. And millions of ACA enrollees across the nation may not be aware that, unless they\u2019ve specifically asked to be in a plan with no elective abortion coverage, part of their monthly fee will be used to end a baby\u2019s life.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "WORLD", "description": "A family in Connecticut dropped its lawsuit against the Obama administration last week when the state\u2019s healthcare exchange added options that no longer require", "title": "WORLD | Connecticut agrees to offer health plans with no abortion coverage | Sarah Padbury | Nov. 28, 2014", "url": "http://www.worldmag.com/2014/11/connecticut_agrees_to_offer_health_plans_with_no_abortion_coverage", "image": "http://www.worldmag.com/media/images/content/ap090122023972.jpg", "type": "article"}, "keywords": "world magazine, christian world news magazine, christian views, christian perspectives, god's world magazine", "description": "A family in Connecticut dropped its lawsuit against the Obama administration last week when the state\u2019s healthcare exchange added options that no longer require"}, "article_summary": "States may opt-out or limit elective abortion coverage in some or all of their plans, according to their own abortion laws.\nAfter further research, Bracy discovered all plans on the Connecticut exchange included elective abortion coverage.\nOn Nov. 19, Bracy voluntarily dropped the lawsuit after Connecticut officials announced they would add two plans with no elective abortion coverage.\nInformation about which plans cover elective abortions and which don\u2019t will be posted on the state exchange\u2019s website.\nBracy is the executive director of the Rhode Island State Right to Life Committee, a small nonprofit that doesn\u2019t offer health insurance plans for employees, requiring workers to purchase their own."}
