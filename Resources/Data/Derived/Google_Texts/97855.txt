Several cars in a Wichita neighborhood were damaged by vandals late Friday night.

The person or persons used cans of spray paint to vandalize cars. Some cars were sprayed with random patterns, other cars had writing on them. One read "call me," followed by a expletive and a phone number.

"It's just inexcusable," said one of the victims of the vandalism, "I don't see the point in this really."

KAKE News did call the phone number on the car but the call failed to connect.

Most of the cars that were vandalized were sitting street-side and were light colored (white, silver or beige).

Many of the cars were located near the intersection of Central and Oliver in Wichita.

CrimeStoppers is a good number to call if there is information that can get the person or people held accountable for the vandalism. That number is (316) 267-2111.
