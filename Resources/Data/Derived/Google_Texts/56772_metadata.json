I wish every moment of every day of the last three days that I was in that bed and not him.\"\n\nCaiden's organs shut down late Friday night, passing away with family by his side.\n\n\"It feels like somebody's ripped my heart out because irregardless if I have two other children that's my baby,\" says Beagle. \"Me and Caiden fought so many battles together because it was me and him for a long time.\"\n\nHe'll be remembered as a little boy with a big heart who was always looking to lend a hand.\n\n\"Most of all he was my little body guard,\" says Beagle.\n\nCaiden's mother and two little sisters are now without a home and belongings, but that's the last thing on their minds.\n\n\"I would live on the streets if I had all my children right there by my side,\" says Beagle. \"Mommy loves you baby, with all my heart to the moon and back a trillion times.\"\n\nCaiden gave gift of sight to two people, including a young boy around his age. The family tells KAKE News everyone is welcome at his funeral. They would like people to bring a Christmas gift to donate to the children's hospital at Saint Francis.\n\nIf you'd like to help, Caiden's family has set up a fund to help pay for medical bills.
