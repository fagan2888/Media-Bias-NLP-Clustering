The California Highway Patrol has hundreds of positions that become vacant due to retirement every year and the department is accepting applications for its cadet training program.

Aired 9/9/13 on KPBS News. After being unable to fill vacancies because of a hiring freeze, the California Highway Patrol is looking for super-qualified candidates to become new officers.

Chuck King is the Commander of the training center in West Sacramento. He said the department hopes to have 600 cadets go through training next year.

"We're hopeful to have four classes in the upcoming year for 2014; the classes are every three months usually. So, they overlap because the training is 27 weeks long; usually we'll have a junior and senior cadet class," King explained.

The CHP training center is in West Sacramento and has 69 disciplines in its training program including physical fitness, and training in firearms, self-defense, and high-speed driving.

The cadets live on site for the duration of their training. Applications for the next class will be accepted September 12th through the 14th.
