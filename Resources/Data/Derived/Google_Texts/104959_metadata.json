He said he plans to still seek a court appraisal of the value of Dell shares, a process that could impact the profits he ultimately takes home.\n\nThe activist and other shareholders that agitated in the fight did pressure buyout partners Michael Dell and private-equity firm Silver Lake to boost their bid last month to $13.75 a share, up from $13.65 a share. The buyout group also added a special 13-cent dividend and guaranteed a third-quarter dividend of eight cents a share.\n\nMr. Icahn first revealed a position in Dell in March, the month after the original deal had been struck, and began a campaign to block the deal. He proposed an alternative in which the company would repurchase a majority of shares for $14 a piece along with a partial warrant for shares. That would have left a small part of Dell still trading on the market, allowing shareholders to partake in any risk, and reward, of a potential Dell turnaround.\n\nIn the appraisal scenario, Mr. Icahn has 60 days after the shareholder vote to decide whether, rather than sell into the buyout, he will instead ask a judge to rule whether Dell shares are worth more, or possibly less, than the buyout price. Whatever price the judge would rule would be the price Mr. Icahn, and any other shareholders seeking the appraisal, would get.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Carl Icahn is looking at about a $70 million profit on his six-month investment in Dell Inc. if the buyout of the computer company passes this week and he sells his stake into the deal, a person familiar with his investment said Monday.", "title": "Carl Icahn Looking at $70 Million Profit on Dell Investment", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2013/09/09/carl-icahn-looking-at-70-million-profit-on-dell-investment/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/MK-CF231_DELL_F_E_20130801194243.jpg"}, "site": "WSJMoneyBeat", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Markets", "article.headline": "Carl Icahn Looking at $70 Million Profit on Dell Investment", "description": "Carl Icahn is looking at about a $70 million profit on his six-month investment in Dell Inc. if the buyout of the computer company passes this week and he sells his stake into the deal, a person familiar with his investment said Monday.", "article_section": "Markets", "author": "David Benoit", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "MoneyBeat Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "MoneyBeat", "article.summary": "Carl Icahn is looking at about a $70 million profit on his six-month investment in Dell Inc. if the buyout of the computer company passes this week and he sells his stake into the deal, a person familiar with his investment said Monday.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2013-09-09T16:35:57-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-143", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2013/09/09/carl-icahn-looking-at-70-million-profit-on-dell-investment/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-MBB-7717", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Markets", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Carl Icahn is looking at about a $70 million profit on his six-month investment in Dell Inc. if the buyout of the computer company passes this week and he sells his stake into the deal, a person familiar with his investment said Monday.", "title": "Carl Icahn Looking at $70 Million Profit on Dell Investment", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2013/09/09/carl-icahn-looking-at-70-million-profit-on-dell-investment/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/blogs/img/WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "MoneyBeat", "article.id": "BL-MBB-7717", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2013-09-09T16:36:17-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1f77\"", "article_summary": "Whatever price the judge would rule would be the price Mr. Icahn, and any other shareholders seeking the appraisal, would get.\nMonday, Mr. Icahn announced he had resigned himself to losing his campaign to upend the deal, telling Dell shareholders he wasn\u2019t going to take further action.\nCarl Icahn is looking at about a $70 million profit on his six-month investment in Dell if the buyout of the computer company passes this week and he sells his stake into the deal, a person familiar with his investment said Monday.\nMr. Icahn first revealed a position in Dell in March, the month after the original deal had been struck, and began a campaign to block the deal.\nHe said he plans to still seek a court appraisal of the value of Dell shares, a process that could impact the profits he ultimately takes home."}
