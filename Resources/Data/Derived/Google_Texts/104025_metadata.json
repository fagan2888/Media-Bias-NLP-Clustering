It wasn\u2019t true. And in the end, they didn\u2019t buy it. My campaign was going to put my foot on whoever\u2019s throat was coming after me. I know that if you let up for a minute \u2014 complacency is dangerous. I wasn\u2019t ever going to get complacent. I decided I\u2019m not going to let anybody take this from me \u2014 from us.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s what we are going to get with our newly elected Senator \u2014 and with our delegates Daryl Cowles and Saira Blair \u2014 and newly elected State Senator Charles Trump and with our Congressman Alex Mooney \u2014 foot on the throat politics.\n\nThey all have reputations of being \u201cnice\u201d people.\n\nBut they are \u201cnice\u201d people who believe in foot on the throat politics.\n\nThey all benefited from race baiting ads that cluttered the mailboxes of West Virginia voters, including one from Go West Virginia Inc. that landed in mailboxes across the state on the Saturday before the election.\n\nThe mailer showed a picture of a menancing Barack Obama covered in a red tint with the tagline \u2014 EPA\u2019s War on Coal, Failed Obamacare, Failed Education System.\n\nAnd now that they are elected, it will be their feet on the throats of the people of West Virginia.\n\nTake the issue of raising the minimum wage.\n\nThere is no question that if raising the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour were on the ballot in West Virginia on Tuesday, it would have passed overwhelmingly.\n\nOn Tuesday, minimum wage initiatives passed in four Republican dominated states \u00ad\u00ad\u2013 Alaska, Arkansas, Nebraska, and South Dakota \u2014 \u00ad\u00adall four of which elected Republican senators alongside the initiative.\n\nAnd yet, Cowles, Blair, Trump, Capito and Mooney \u2014 will all fight off any effort to increase the minimum wage.\n\nEarlier this year, Cowles voted against raising the minimum wage by $1.50 from $7.25 to $8.75.\n\nLast Sunday, in a debate in Romney, Trump spoke out forcefully against the idea of a minimum wage.\n\nLast month on Kercheval\u2019s show, Mooney dodged a question about raising the minimum wage.\n\nAnd Capito, even though she voted for raising the minimum wage in 2006, refuses to answer questions from constituents about raising the minimum wage today.\n\nDuring the interview yesterday, Kercheval asked Capito about Senator Harry Reid not allowing for debate on certain issues.\n\n\u201cPeople would rather hear your opinion,\u201d Capito said.\u201dThey would rather have you debate the issue, rather than hide from it. Maybe people don\u2019t agree with you all the time. I don\u2019t think people expect to agree with you all the time. But they do expect you to form an opinion and have a pathway to do what you think is the right thing to do. But if you are not even bringing it up, you are not even giving people a chance to explain why I\u2019m for this, why I\u2019m not for this, why I think it could be better. The American people just want to be talked to as adults in a straight way.\u201d\n\nOf course, for years Capito has refused to discuss the issue of raising the minimum wage.\n\nAt a rally in Romney last month, she refused to answer a question about it and ran away from the reporter who was trying to ask the question.\n\nShe has repeatedly refused requests for a town hall meeting to discuss the issue. More than 400 of her constituents have signed a petition asking for such a meeting \u2014 to no avail.\n\n\u201cThey would rather have you debate the issue, rather than hide from it,\u201d Capito said.\n\nOr run from it.", "article_metadata": {}, "article_summary": "They all benefited from race baiting ads that cluttered the mailboxes of West Virginia voters, including one from Go West Virginia Inc. that landed in mailboxes across the state on the Saturday before the election.\nWest Virginia Senator elect Shelley Moore Capito was on Hoppy Kercheval\u2019s Metronews Talkline show yesterday.\nAnd Capito, even though she voted for raising the minimum wage in 2006, refuses to answer questions from constituents about raising the minimum wage today.\nAnd now that they are elected, it will be their feet on the throats of the people of West Virginia.\nAnd yet, Cowles, Blair, Trump, Capito and Mooney \u2014 will all fight off any effort to increase the minimum wage."}
