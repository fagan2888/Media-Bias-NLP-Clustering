Just last week, the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) said that the Pentagon can\u2019t account for how its spent more than $1.3 billion intended to build roads, bridges and schools.\n\nRelated: Pentagon Doesn\u2019t Know What Happened to $1.3 Billion in Afghanistan\n\nNow, a new report from the auditors suggests that agencies involved in the rebuilding are struggling to coordinate their efforts.\n\nSIGAR reported that a $488 million fund intended to help prop up the country\u2019s mining, oil and gas industry is vulnerable to waste, fraud and abuse because the agencies responsible for the program\u2014the State Department, USAID and the Pentagon\u2019s Task Force for Business and Stability Operations (TFBSO)\u2014are disorganized and don\u2019t talk to each other.\n\nThe lack of coordination has led the agencies to each implement different programs\u2014resulting in duplication and projects that weren\u2019t planned well enough to be sustainable, the auditors said.\n\n\u201cWithout sound sustainability planning within and among all agencies active in Afghanistan's extractive industries, the $488 million U.S. government investment in efforts to develop Afghanistan's extractive industries could be wasted,\u201d SIGAR said.\n\nRelated: 7 Threats to U.S. Rebuilding Efforts in Afghanistan\n\nThe report included several examples demonstrating how uncoordinated the agencies are.\n\nIn one instance, a senior official at the U.S. Embassy in Kabul said that the embassy didn\u2019t know anything about a $40 million TFBSO project until Afghan government officials thanked the ambassador for the support.\n\nThe auditors recommended that the three agencies improve communication strategies and develop a system to better track what each of them is doing to bolster Afghanistan\u2019s oil and gas industry.\n\nOfficials from USAID, State, and TFBSO all conceded that coordination efforts had all but fallen apart by last year and agreed to the auditors\u2019 recommendations.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The U.S.\u2019s $104 billion-and-counting efforts to rebuild Afghanistan ar", "title": "Watchdog: Almost $500 Million at Risk in Afghanistan", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/28/Watchdog-Almost-500-Million-Risk-Afghanistan", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02082011_Afghanistan_Child_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/28/Watchdog-Almost-500-Million-Risk-Afghanistan", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02082011_Afghanistan_Child_article.jpg", "creator": "@Briannaehley", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The U.S.\u2019s $104 billion-and-counting efforts to rebuild Afghanistan ar", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccd84\"", "article_summary": "Officials from USAID, State, and TFBSO all conceded that coordination efforts had all but fallen apart by last year and agreed to the auditors\u2019 recommendations.\nIn one instance, a senior official at the U.S. Embassy in Kabul said that the embassy didn\u2019t know anything about a $40 million TFBSO project until Afghan government officials thanked the ambassador for the support.\nThe U.S.\u2019s $104 billion-and-counting efforts to rebuild Afghanistan are under constant scrutiny for falling short on coordination and oversight, which has put much of that money at risk.\nThe federal auditor tasked with keeping tabs on where U.S. tax dollars are going has repeatedly flagged vulnerabilities that jeopardize the overall program.\n\u201cWithout sound sustainability planning within and among all agencies active in Afghanistan's extractive industries, the $488 million U.S. government investment in efforts to develop Afghanistan's extractive industries could be wasted,\u201d SIGAR said."}
