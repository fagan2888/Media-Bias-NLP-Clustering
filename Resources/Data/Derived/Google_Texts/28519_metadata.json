Since that announcement, the lovable ladies of Nevada\u2019s renowned Moonlite Bunny Ranch have come out in support of our former first lady in a serious, potentially large-scale campaign called \u201cHookers for Hillary.\u201d These Everyday Americans have chosen their candidate.\n\nWhen Hillary Clinton kicked off her campaign to win the hearts and minds of Americans everywhere, she started, as most do, in the heartland. It was during a recent trip to Iowa where she met with a small group of concerned business owners\u2014people who questioned the future of America\u2019s health-care policy and wanted to know how she proposed to fix it.\n\nAfter hearing the concerns and challenges these Iowans faced, particularly in regards to health care, Clinton said she\u2019d consider having insurance companies compete across state lines. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to have a free market system, we need a free market where we\u2019ve got people competing on cost and quality, and that may be one thing we need to look at,\u201d Clinton said. And the Hookers for Hillary couldn\u2019t agree more. In fact, their website boasts a four-point platform outlining their endorsement, and protecting health-care reform is at the top.\n\n\u201cThis is the first time ever that over 500 independent contractors, or as you call it legalized prostitutes, were able to get health care and that's because of the Affordable Care Act,\u201d says Krissy Summers, a prostitute and Hookers for Hillary supporter. \u201cWhether someone agrees with legal prostitution or not it\u2019s not right to take health care away from us. We pay into taxes too.\u201d\n\nBunny Ranch owner Dennis Hof agrees. \u201cWith Obamacare the girls were able to buy good health insurance and without it they weren\u2019t able to. Since Day One when I bought the brothel in 1992 no legal prostitute could get health insurance,\u201d says Hof.\n\nAccording to the National Task Force on Prostitution, it\u2019s estimated that well over 1 million people in the U.S. have worked as prostitutes\u2014or roughly 1 percent of American women. If this campaign is a success, that could translate into some serious voting power.\n\n\u201cA lot of people are going to look at this and say it\u2019s a publicity stunt, but it\u2019s more than a publicity stunt. When you can get publicity and do the right thing then you\u2019ve got a winner. And we\u2019ve got a winner here,\u201d says Hof. \u201cYou\u2019re going to see crazy things. They\u2019re going to show up at rallies in bikinis. Bunnies for Hillary. They\u2019re going to push the issue and stir it up because when you stir it up you get people thinking and looking at it.\u201d\n\nAccording to one of the \u201cbunnies,\u201d Air Force Amy, just stirring up a conversation would make the campaign a success. \u201cIt gets people talking about it at local hometown levels,\u201d says Amy. \u201cThere were one thousand comments within 36 hours on the TMZ post. Of course there is a lot of prostitution-bashing and a lot of pro and con Hillary comments, but it gets the word out and gets people talking about it.\u201d\n\nRegardless of your stance on Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential bid, \u201cHookers for Hillary\u201d has a certain ring to it and it\u2019s getting the media\u2019s attention. With that kind of endorsement the conversations promise to be lively. Just take a look at why these ladies support Clinton\u2019s foreign policy, according to their website HookersforHillary.com: \u201cThe Bunny Ranch entertains customers from all around the globe, and the girls have great respect for any woman who can take powerful men from oppressive cultures and make them bend to her will.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "MissAuroraSnow"}, "keywords": "presidential election, sex, Nevada,United States, entertainment, Google, Hillary Clinton, U.S. Politics", "publicationDate": 201504210915, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/entertainment", "description": "Nevada\u2019s infamous brothel Moonlite Bunny Ranch has launched a campaign dubbed \u201cHookers For Hillary.\u201d Here, the working women explain why they\u2019re Team Hillary 2016.", "pageNum": 1, "title": "Meet the Hookers for Hillary: Why Prostitutes Want Hillary Clinton for President", "tags": "entity:politicalevent/presidential_election,sex,entity:provinceorstate/nevada_united_states,topic:entertainment,syndication:syndication-google,entity:person/hillary_clinton,u_s_politics0", "environment": "dev", "platform": "desktop", "template": "article", "type": "house", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Meet the \u2018Hookers for Hillary\u2019: Why Prostitutes Want Hillary Clinton for President\",\"link\":\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/04/21/meet-the-hookers-for-hillary-why-prostitutes-want-hillary-clinton-for-president.html\",\"image_url\":\"http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/04/21/meet-the-hookers-for-hillary-why-prostitutes-want-hillary-clinton-for-president/jcr:content/image.crop.410.273.jpg/47737843.cached.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/04/21/meet-the-hookers-for-hillary-why-prostitutes-want-hillary-clinton-for-president\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-04-21T09:15:00+00:00\",\"section\":\"Entertainment\",\"author\":\"Aurora Snow\",\"tags\":[\"presidential_election\",\"sex\",\"nevada_united_states\",\"entertainment\",\"syndication-google\",\"hillary_clinton\",\"u_s_politics0\"]}", "news_keywords": "presidential election, sex, Nevada United States, Entertainment, Google, Hillary Clinton, US Politics", "sectionTaxanomies": "entertainment", "fb": {"admins": "1703087,30000737,1117577220,1276800108,931159,514915512", "app_id": 189930913679}, "authors": "Aurora Snow", "article": {"section": "entertainment", "published_time": "2015-04-21T09:15:00.000Z", "author": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/contributors/aurora-snowhtml"}, "resourceType": "dailybeast2/components/pages/article", "contentpath": "/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/04/21/meet-the-hookers-for-hillary-why-prostitutes-want-hillary-clinton-for-president", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "Nevada\u2019s infamous brothel Moonlite Bunny Ranch has launched a campaign dubbed \u201cHookers For Hillary.\u201d Here, the working women explain why they\u2019re Team Hillary 2016.", "title": "Meet the \u2018Hookers for Hillary\u2019: Why Prostitutes Want Hillary Clinton for President", "url": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/04/21/meet-the-hookers-for-hillary-why-prostitutes-want-hillary-clinton-for-president.html", "image": "http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/04/21/meet-the-hookers-for-hillary-why-prostitutes-want-hillary-clinton-for-president/jcr:content/image.img.2000.jpg/1432135313376.cached.jpg", "type": "article"}, "authorIds": "/etc/authors/a/aurora-snow", "content-type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8"}, "article_summary": "\u201cEveryday Americans need a champion,\u201d Hillary Clinton proclaimed in her YouTube video.\nAfter hearing the concerns and challenges these Iowans faced, particularly in regards to health care, Clinton said she\u2019d consider having insurance companies compete across state lines.\nWhen Hillary Clinton kicked off her campaign to win the hearts and minds of Americans everywhere, she started, as most do, in the heartland.\nTHE MOVEMENTNevada\u2019s infamous brothel Moonlite Bunny Ranch has launched a campaign dubbed \u201cHookers For Hillary.\u201d Here, the working women explain why they\u2019re Team Hillary 2016.\n\u201cWhether someone agrees with legal prostitution or not it\u2019s not right to take health care away from us."}
