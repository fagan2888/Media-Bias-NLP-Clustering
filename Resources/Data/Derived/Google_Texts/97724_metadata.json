However, 61 percent said they struggled to find qualified applicants compared to 51 percent one year earlier.\n\nAs a result, 71 percent of the chamber members said they increased their recruiting, 32 percent increased wages and 32 percent reported training in-house to fill new jobs. Thirty-one percent said they hired less qualified workers and 27 percent said they increased overtime.\n\n\"Thirty-one percent responded that positions were not filled because they could not find qualified talent. When it comes to finding qualified employees, social media replaced recruiting events as the top tool,\" the chamber said in its news release.\n\n\"We will continue to advocate on behalf of our members in support of creating a strong talent system from early childhood education to the K-12 system as well as programs like Michigan's Skilled Trades Training Fund that raise the capabilities of our existing workforce,\" said Allie Bush, the chamber's director of Government Affairs.\n\n\"Michigan's economic recovery has taken some pressure off local government budgets, but wise investment remains critical to help us address legacy costs and better prepare us for the next rainy day,\" said Josh Lunger, director of Government Affairs.\n\nA summary of the survey can be found at grandrapids.org/government-affairs-survey.\n\nJim Harger covers business for MLive/Grand Rapids Press.
