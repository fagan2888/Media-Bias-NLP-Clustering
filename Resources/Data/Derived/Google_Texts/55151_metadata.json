The words \u201cdon\u2019t shoot\u201d were first claimed to be Brown\u2019s last words as Officer Darren Wilson shot him execution style in the back, but ballistic and DNA evidence, plus eyewitness accounts of roughly 40 witnesses prove neither was true.\n\nIn fact, forensic evidence showed that Brown went after Officer Wilson\u2019s gun during a fight inside the police car, making it a clear-cut case of self defense.\n\nIn the end, the facts became clear: Brown wasn\u2019t shot in the back, his hands weren\u2019t up, and he didn\u2019t mouth the words \u2018don\u2019t shoot,\u2019 but the phrase stuck and remains a popular rallying cry for those drawing attention to the deaths of African Americans at the hands of law enforcement officers.
