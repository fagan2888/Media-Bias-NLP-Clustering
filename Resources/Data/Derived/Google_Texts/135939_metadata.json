Goldstein Fellow of Spinal Surgery, Strong Memorial Hospital, Rochester, N.Y., 1989\n\nWork history: I began working at age 12 at Dusty and Dewey's Grocery in Logan, Ia., for 50 cents an hour. After college I sold auto parts for three years at Fochtman Motor Company in northern Michigan till 1975. After medical training, I served as a Navy doctor with the U.S. Marine Corps. I was in private solo practice of spinal surgery till 2009. In the last 5 years, I have been a private contractor practicing orthopaedics at a critical-access hospital in an underserved area of Iowa.\n\nPolitical experience: My best qualification is that I am not a professional politician. When my husband was stationed in Arizona, I was in private practice and was elected chief of staff at Yuma Regional Medical Center, a 250-bed hospital with 220 physicians. I am past president of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, and a national speaker on the perils of government-run health care.\n\nCivic involvement: When I was in full-time practice, I worked 100-hour weeks caring for all comers in the emergency room. My charity was done at work. Now, I volunteer time to teach ethical medicine to today's medical students and have served on the Board of the Arizona Medical Association.\n\nFamily: I was married 30 years to a USMC officer, Ross Hieb. My son Nathan is 25 and a senior medical student at Creighton University. My son Mason is 21 and a junior electrical engineering student at Tulsa University.\n\nReligious affiliation: Was raised in the Christian Church, not currently a member of a particular congregation.\n\nCampaign website: www.Hieb2014.org\n\n\n\nTwitter handle:@Hieb2014\n\nFacebook page: Facebook.com/hieb2014\n\n\n\nTop three issues\n\nEducation: End Common Core by saying no to the federal programs that have brought us increased expense without increased educational benefit. Do we really want federal employees sitting in our classrooms (as outlined in the federal DOE website as the \"ambassador\" program) insuring compliance to this program? We were top of the educational pyramid when we actually had local control -- no departments of education to give us \"standards.\"\n\nHealth care: Save Iowa's budget by ending the Obamacare exchanges which are totally unaffordable and will not improve access to health care. Cost-effective medicine was practiced for over a hundred years in Iowa. My father charged $3 for an office visit and $6 for a house call in 1970. Today it costs on average $68 just to bill a third party. The answer (details on my website) is the 3 C's -- cash for outpatient care; catastrophic insurance, not prepaid health care; and local charity for those in need.\n\nBusiness: We need to diminish the heavy-handed regulations and taxation that are killing our small businesses and driving jobs out of Iowa. Big businesses are able to withstand the regulations that put smaller businesses out of business. Regulators are incentivized to regulate to keep and expand their jobs at the expense of the private citizen who then cannot afford the compliance expense. We are at a tipping point. We have 20 percent more government workers per capita than California. We need their jobs to be shifted to the private sector, which will then blossom.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://dmreg.co/1x8OuSg", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Learn about Lee Deakins Hieb, Libertarian Party candidate for Iowa governor", "p": {"domain_verify": "372c291dc2b106308d26264f4fba3b10"}, "og": {"site_name": "Des Moines Register", "description": "Learn about Lee Deakins Hieb, Libertarian Party candidate for Iowa governor", "title": "Meet the Candidate: Iowa Governor: Lee Deakins Hieb, Libertarian Party", "url": "http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/2014/10/04/iowa-election-lee-deakins-hieb-bio-issues/15491911/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/desmoinesregister.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Learn about Lee Deakins Hieb, Libertarian Party candidate for Iowa governor", "title": "Meet the Candidate: Iowa Governor: Lee Deakins Hieb, Libertarian Party", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ed8149adcac12aabe27259178c456cb7f5ea37c8/c=0-650-2592-3242&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/IAGroup/DesMoines/2014/09/11/1410491218000-Lee-D.-Hieb,-MD.jpg", "creator": "@DMRegister", "site": "@DMRegister", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600025120", "fb": {"app_id": 169766623060429}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Places/University of Iowa", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Places/University of Iowa", "title": "Meet the Candidate: Iowa Governor: Lee Deakins Hieb, Libertarian Party", "author": "The Des Moines Register", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/politics", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6cbff131503fa30d5ef582e90d498e8f3851d357/c=262-777-2592-3872/local/-/media/IAGroup/DesMoines/2014/09/11/1410491218000-Lee-D.-Hieb,-MD.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/12784eabae3e19eda2372e6ff533ceefee36affe/c=0-650-2592-3242/local/-/media/IAGroup/DesMoines/2014/09/11/1410491218000-Lee-D.-Hieb,-MD.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f6808efcc3c0d0b0758a815ae844fa45f322ae0e/c=0-767-2592-2718/local/-/media/IAGroup/DesMoines/2014/09/11/1410491218000-Lee-D.-Hieb,-MD.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0724a63fee629e59bc8016bb173289c171e8d060/c=0-777-2592-2243&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/IAGroup/DesMoines/2014/09/11/1410491218000-Lee-D.-Hieb,-MD.jpg", "publishtime": "2014-10-14T19:19:44-05:00", "shorthed": "Meet the Candidate: Lee Deakins Hieb on the issues", "articleid": 15491911, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c388dbe72db16df10b67bc28a1b036edd78a10eb/c=0-777-2592-2243/local/-/media/IAGroup/DesMoines/2014/09/11/1410491218000-Lee-D.-Hieb,-MD.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b99e779d49d8644436e9239c7b0aa4e596607741/c=349-641-2165-3872/local/-/media/IAGroup/DesMoines/2014/09/11/1410491218000-Lee-D.-Hieb,-MD.jpg"}}}, "article_summary": "Lee Deakins Hieb (Photo: Special To The Register)There are five candidates in the general election: Republican Terry Branstad, Democrat Jack Hatch, Jim Hennager of the New Independent Party Iowa, Lee Deakins Hieb of the Libertarian Party and Jonathan Narcisse of the Iowa Party.\nLee Deakins HiebAge: 61Date of birth: Oct. 21, 1952Place of birth: Chicago, Ill.\nWhen my husband was stationed in Arizona, I was in private practice and was elected chief of staff at Yuma Regional Medical Center, a 250-bed hospital with 220 physicians.\nI was in private solo practice of spinal surgery till 2009.\nCivic involvement: When I was in full-time practice, I worked 100-hour weeks caring for all comers in the emergency room."}
