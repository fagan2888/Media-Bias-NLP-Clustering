Rockstar reportedly sank as much as $265 million into the project. This is $100 million more than the blockbuster crime/car-carnage movie \u201cFast & Furious 6,\u201d and if true, would make \u201cGTA V\u201d the most expensive video game ever made. Other analysts have estimated that the game cost about as much as that film. Either way, it\u2019s clear that the game is setting a new bar for blockbuster entertainment.\n\nRELATED: VIDEO GAME CHANGERS - 21 TITLES THAT ROCKED THE INDUSTRY\n\n\u201cGTA V\u201d also looks likely to become the most profitable game ever. It is slated to sell 24 million copies and rake in over a billion dollars, a figure that rivals successful films like \u201cSkyfall\u201d and \u201cIron Man 3.\u201d In anticipation of its launch, shares of Take-Two Interactive have surged 60 percent since the start of the year.\n\nThere's no question that the face of gaming has changed. Back in the heady days of acid-wash jeans and gaudy tracksuits, most games were created by small production houses, with programmers filling multiple roles. Even as late as 2002, cult classic videogame \u201cMax Payne\u201dhad its titular character modeled and voiced by its writer, Sam Lake. Fast forward to 2013, and the upcoming Quantic Dream title \u201cBeyond: Two Souls\u201d bills Hollywood stars Ellen Page and Willem Dafoe, with a score composed by the renowned Hans Zimmer.\n\nFar from the pubescent, acne-studded nerd world of gaming in the '90s as portrayed in multiple cringe-worthy movies, most surveys now peg the average gamer as a thirtysomething year-old person (of either sex) who games to relax after juggling work, kids, and other responsibilities. The skateboarding, Mountain Dew drinking gamers of the '90s have grown up, and gaming has grown up with them.\n\nIt's hard to imagine anyone lining up at midnight for a cartridge of \u201cMissile Command\u201d or \u201cBreakout.\u201dLike it or not, games have evolved into a nuanced, artistically valid and profitable entertainment sector.
