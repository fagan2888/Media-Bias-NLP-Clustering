Roberts Jr., June 29, 2015\n\nRoberts\u2019s intellectual complexity does not prevent him from expressing himself pithily, as he did with those words when dissenting in a case from Arizona. Joined by Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas and Samuel A. Alito Jr., Roberts\u2019s dissent should somewhat mollify conservatives who are dismayed about his interpretive ingenuity four days earlier in writing the opinion that saved the Affordable Care Act. Furthermore, they, including this columnist, may have missed a wrinkle in Roberts\u2019s ACA opinion that will serve conservatives\u2019 long-term interests.\n\nTo end gerrymanders, Arizona voters, by referendum, amended the state\u2019s constitution to strip the legislature of its control of redistricting. They created an Independent Redistricting Commission (IRC) on which no member of the legislature may serve.\n\nHowever, the U.S. Constitution\u2019s elections clause says, \u201cThe times, places and manner of holding elections for senators and representatives, shall be prescribed in each state by the legislature thereof.\u201d When Arizona\u2019s legislature sued, the IRC\u2019s implausible response was: The Constitution\u2019s Framers did not use the word \u201clegislature\u201d as it was then and still is used, to denote the representative bodies that make states\u2019 laws. Rather, the IRC said the Framers used \u201clegislature\u201d eccentrically, to mean any process, such as a referendum, that creates any entity, such as the IRC, that produces binding edicts.\n\nImplausibility is not an insurmountable barrier to persuading a Supreme Court majority, and last week five justices accepted the IRC\u2019s argument. Ruth Bader Ginsburg, joined by Anthony M. Kennedy, Stephen G. Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, said: There is \u201cno suggestion\u201d that when the Framers stipulated that the manner of a state\u2019s elections should be determined by \u201cthe legislature thereof\u201d the Framers necessarily meant \u201cthe state\u2019s representative body.\u201d\n\nThis detonated Roberts, who began his dissent by saying: The reformers who waged \u201can arduous, decades-long campaign\u201d to achieve ratification in 1913 of the 17th Amendment establishing popular election of U.S. senators could have saved themselves the trouble. They could have adopted what Roberts calls the \u201cmagic trick\u201d the majority performed regarding Arizona. What chumps the reformers were for not simply asserting this: Sure, the Framers stipulated that two senators from each state were to be chosen \u201cby the legislature thereof,\u201d but the Framers really meant \u201cby the people.\u201d\n\nRoberts said the majority wasted much ink defending a proposition that \u201cnobody doubts\u201d \u2014 that the people of Arizona can, under their state constitution, exercise lawmaking powers. They cannot, however, establish governmental processes that violate the U.S. Constitution. With many citations from the Federalist Papers and Supreme Court precedents, Roberts emphasized that a state\u2019s \u201clegislature\u201d was not a term of uncertain meaning when the Framers put it into the Constitution.\n\nMany conservatives may be muttering, \u201cWhere was this semantically punctilious Roberts four days earlier?\u201d Then, Roberts said that although the Affordable Care Act says insurance subsidies are to be distributed by the IRS through exchanges \u201cestablished by the state,\u201d the language does not mean this when read in the context of Congress\u2019s clear purpose (broad health-care coverage). So, the IRS can distribute subsidies through exchanges established by the federal government.\n\nThis is not because the court deferred to the IRS, an independent agency, in interpreting the statute. On the contrary, the court denied the power of the IRS \u2014 and, inferentially, the power of the executive branch \u2014 to be the final word on statutory interpretation. Instead, the court, in the act of deference to Congress\u2019s objective in enacting the ACA, asserted its power to render the final, if properly deferential, word in interpreting what Congress does. Thus did judicial aggression against one branch come cloaked in the cloth of deference to another.\n\nConstruing the Constitution in the Arizona case, Roberts said the Framers\u2019 language was as clear as their purpose, to which deference is due. Interpreting the health-care statute, Roberts said Congress\u2019s language was \u201cinartful\u201d but, read in the context of the ACA\u2019s structure, was not ambiguous and should not defeat Congress\u2019s purpose, to which the court owes deference.\n\nRoberts\u2019s ruling advanced a crucial conservative objective, that of clawing back power from the executive branch and independent agencies that increasingly operate essentially free from congressional control and generally obedient to presidents. If conservatives cannot achieve their objectives, including ACA repeal, through the legislative branch, conservatism\u2019s future is too bleak to be much diminished by anything courts do. If, however, conservatives can advance their agenda through Congress, they will benefit from Roberts\u2019s ACA opinion, which buttresses legislative supremacy.\n\nRead more from George F.
