The group dispatched Steptoe & Johnson, a lobbying firm it retains, to analyze the bill.\n\nLobby groups that represent major for-profit health care interests in Colorado, including hospitals and insurance brokers, are similarly mobilizing against Amendment 69. The Colorado Association of Commerce & Industry \u2014 a trade group led in part by HCA HealthOne, a subsidiary of HCA, one of the largest private hospital chains in the country \u2014 is soliciting funds to defeat single payer. The business coalition to defeat the measure also includes the state\u2019s largest association of health insurance brokers.\n\nThe proposal calls for the Colorado legislature to pass new laws raising $25 billion a year from a mix of employer payroll taxes, a 3 percent tax on employee gross pay, and a new tax on self-employed net income. The money would be used for a new health care system that would cover all premiums and out-of-pocket costs for health and dental care. The state would also be charged with negotiating with providers and for better drug prices. Supporters of the plan say the system would save $4.5 billion a year.\n\nI asked Sean Duffy, a spokesperson for \u201cColoradans for Coloradans,\u201d an ad hoc coalition against the single-payer ballot measure, how the state should address high health care costs and those struggling to afford health insurance premiums.\n\n\u201cWe are focused on sharing with Coloradans the numerous questions, ambiguities, and concerns with Amendment 69,\u201d said Duffy. He noted that \u201cmotivations for universal coverage are shared by many in Colorado\u201d but that making Colorado a \u201cone-state experiment, and the cost of doubling our state budget, potentially diminishing the accessibility and quality of care and creating an unaccountable, massive bureaucracy is just not a good idea for Colorado.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. is the only wealthy nation without a publicly financed universal health care system \u2014 and spends far more than every other industrialized nation on health care costs. America also has one of the highest infant mortality rates of countries ranked by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.\n\nPatients using Medicare, the single-payer program for the elderly set up by President Lyndon Johnson, consistently tell pollsters that they prefer Medicare over private insurance. But expanding the system has proven difficult over industry opposition. Profit-driven health care industries and professional medical societies have blocked cost-saving reforms for decades, and in recent years, spent tens of millions of dollars to shape the outcome of President Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act. The health insurance industry in particular lobbied aggressively to shape public opinion and block proposals to expand single payer over the last decade.\n\nAs other states consider proposals to lower costs and expand coverage, health care interests keen to protect some of the largest profit margins in the economy will be sure to mobilize quickly to snuff them out.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "https://prod01-cdn06.cdn.firstlook.org/assets/static/browserconfig.xml", "og": {"site_name": "The Intercept", "description": "Colorado's Amendment 69, up for a vote in November, calls for universal coverage and replacing insurance premiums with higher taxes.", "title": "Health Care Industry Moves Swiftly to Stop Colorado\u2019s \u201cSingle Payer\u201d Ballot Measure", "url": "https://theintercept.com/2016/04/22/colorad-single-payer/", "image": "https://prod01-cdn06.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2016/04/coloradocare1-feature-hero.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Intercept", "description": "Colorado's Amendment 69, up for a vote in November, calls for universal coverage and replacing insurance premiums with higher taxes.", "title": "Health Care Industry Moves Swiftly to Stop Colorado\u2019s \u201cSingle Payer\u201d Ballot Measure", "image": "https://prod01-cdn06.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2016/04/coloradocare1-feature-hero.jpg", "creator": "@the_intercept", "site": "@the_intercept", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "fb": {"pages": 619459291436461}, "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://prod01-cdn07.cdn.firstlook.org/assets/static/mstile-144x144.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "The money would be used for a new health care system that would cover all premiums and out-of-pocket costs for health and dental care.\nThe health insurance industry in particular lobbied aggressively to shape public opinion and block proposals to expand single payer over the last decade.\nThe Council of Insurance Agents & Brokers, a national trade group, is mobilizing its member companies to defeat single payer in Colorado.\nThe campaign in Colorado to create the nation\u2019s first state-based \u201csingle payer\u201d health insurance system, providing universal coverage and replacing insurance premiums with higher taxes, has barely begun.\nLobby groups that represent major for-profit health care interests in Colorado, including hospitals and insurance brokers, are similarly mobilizing against Amendment 69."}
