NCAA Hockey: UNH steps up defense but win eludes team



— The somber mood in the postgame press conference helped tell the story. The University of New Hampshire's latest loss, a 1-0 setback to UMass-Lowell on Friday night, stung more than most.



What caused the extra pain? It seemed to stem from the fact that UNH has been striving to improve on its leaky defense, and when the Wildcats finally turned in a strong defensive effort they were left with nothing to show for it.

..

“It's as good a defensive game as we've played,” UNH coach Dick Umile said. “I thought we played very hard in the defensive zone, and did a really good job there.”



UNH entered the game with the No. 6 offense in Division I (3.95 goals per game) and was No. 5 in power-play percentage (27.5 percent), but couldn't dent goaltender Kevin Boyle or a Lowell defense that was allowing an average of 1.84 goals per game.

..

Lowell (12-4-4, 7-2-3 Hockey East) had given up 35 goals through its first 19 games; UNH (8-8-4, 2-2-4) allowed 66 in its first 19 contests, or 3.47 per game.



Lowell's only goal came with 2:44 to play, when a loose puck found its way to the UNH goal mouth even though the River Hawks failed to put a shot on net. Sophomore right wing Ryan Collins needed several chances to jam the puck past outstretched goaltender Danny Tirone.

..

UNH held Lowell, the top team in Hockey East, to six shots on goal in the final 20 minutes. Each team finished with 27 shots on goal.



Lowell entered the weekend having scored a least one power-play goal in 11 of its last 13 games, but failed to score in three power-play chances Friday night.

..

“I think we've been pretty good (defensively) the last few games,” Tirone said. “We work on it a lot. Any success I have is because of the way the defense plays in front of me. There's been a lot better communication out there. A little less chaos in our zone. When the other teams has a lot of time in our zone we're able to handle it a little better now instead of running around.

..

“We played well defensively and so did they. It came down to who would get the break. Unfortunately they got it tonight.”



UNH defenseman Matias Cleland had a game-high five shots on goal. Cleland said his team's improved defensive performance was a silver lining in the loss.

..

“I thought we played pretty well defensively,” Cleland said. “We have to continue to improve on that. We kind of had a lapse there and that's how they scored that goal, but I think we just have to take the positive of how we played defensively tonight.

..

UNH will now turn its attention to Northeastern. The Wildcats and Huskies will play a home-and-home series next weekend. Northeastern is the only Hockey East team without a victory within the conference.

..

“We're definitely playing better defensively and certainly that's something that we're gonna keep focusing on and it's going to help us down the road,” Tirone said.
