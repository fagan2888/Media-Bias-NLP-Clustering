It has to be denial, or worse, right?\n\nThe best statistic we seem to have comes from a German study of births at all Berlin metropolitan area hospitals back in 1995 and 1996. It showed that one in 475 women didn\u2019t know she was pregnant at 20 weeks, and one in 2,455 gave birth to a viable fetus without realizing she was pregnant until she went into labor.\n\nThe overall numbers are quite small \u2014 62 for first group, and just 12 for the second \u2014 but they are enough to lead the authors to conclude that \u201cthe common view that denied pregnancies are exotic and rare events is not valid. Deliveries in which the woman has not been aware of her pregnancy until going into labor occur about three times more often than triplets.\u201d\n\nBut, really, what we want to know is whether these women have serious psychological issues.\n\nAt least two researchers have done literature reviews and come up with vastly different conclusions. In a 2011 study published in the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine, one team found that such mothers have serious psychological problems.\n\nDividing the \u201cillness\u201d into \u201cpsychotic\u201d and \u201cnon-psychotic\u201d varieties, the researchers wrote that \u201cthis inappropriate defense mechanism may be so powerful that the woman is genuinely unaware of her condition.\u201d\n\nSuch women are \u201cunprepared for delivery and motherhood,\u201d they wrote, posing \u201csignificant risks for both the mother and fetus, including emotional disturbance, lack of antenatal care, precipitous delivery (often into the toilet bowl) and neonaticide.\u201d\n\nBut a 2006 review in the journal Medical Hypotheses offers a much more benign interpretation, even suggesting that these events be called \u201ccryptic\u201d pregnancies, instead of \u201cdenied\u201d pregnancies.\n\nMarco Del Giudice, now at the University of New Mexico, notes that there is conflicting information about whether the women suffered from psychological distress; that only 26 percent of women completely stopped menstruating (some, in their 40s, mistook that for the onset of menopause); only 26 percent reported nausea early in pregnancies; and 56 percent gained little or no weight.\n\nIt may be that women who are unaware they are pregnant have suffered a number of early spontaneous abortions and have lower levels of a pregnancy hormone that causes such symptoms. Or being unaware that she is pregnant could be seen as an \u201cadaptive emergency mechanism\u201d for a woman facing the psychosocial stress of a partner who has deserted her or social isolation, he wrote. \u201cIn my opinion, the literature on this condition is biased by a pervasive assumption that psychological denial is taking place, but, in the majority of cases, there is virtually no evidence supporting this assumption,\u201d Del Giudice said.\n\n\u2013 Lenny Bernstein, The Washington Post", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2015/02/hfqa03.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "article_summary": "The overall numbers are quite small \u2014 62 for first group, and just 12 for the second \u2014 but they are enough to lead the authors to conclude that \u201cthe common view that denied pregnancies are exotic and rare events is not valid.\nThe best statistic we seem to have comes from a German study of births at all Berlin metropolitan area hospitals back in 1995 and 1996.\nIn a 2011 study published in the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine, one team found that such mothers have serious psychological problems.\nQ: How can you go into labor without knowing you\u2019re pregnant?\nAt least two researchers have done literature reviews and come up with vastly different conclusions."}
