All that was missing from Mr. Obama\u2019s celebration was the old \u201cIckey Shuffle\u201d endzone dance.\n\nThis news no doubt came as a bit of a shock to voters since the economy has been sickly for a long long time. As recently as this fall, half of Americans were saying that the country is still in recession.\n\nConditions have improved in the past six months, for sure, with growth accelerating, inflation low and stable, hiring picking up and gas prices tumbling.\n\nBut if things are as good as the White House says they are, why do we feel so bad? Why are we collectively so worried about the fragile future of our nation?\n\nOne answer is that the conventional statistics of economic conditions for families aren\u2019t measuring the real hardships families are facing today. Is there anyone on this continent who really thinks that the unemployment rate is 5.6 percent?\n\nBut here are a dirty dozen hidden indicators of an American economy that may be in a lot worse shape than Washington is telling us.\n\n\u2022 The growth gap. This economic recovery is the slowest in 50 years. If we had had the same pace of improvement since June 2009, when the recession ended, as in an average recovery, national output and incomes would be more than $1 trillion larger today. In other words, we would have about $10,000 more income per family than we do.\n\n\u2022 The raiseless recovery. It\u2019s been 10 years since Americans in the middle class got a pay raise that kept pace with inflation. Median-income households today make $1,500 less than they did when the recession officially ended. The recession really hasn\u2019t ended for half of all families.\n\n\u2022 The myth that inflation is dead. By looking at what middle-income families have to buy \u2013 food, energy, tuition, health care \u2013 prices have been running two to three times the official rate. Low gas prices are helping, but health costs are rising again \u2013 despite that Obamacare was supposed to bend the cost curve down. Oops.\n\n\u2022 Inequality is worse. President Obama has made closing the gap between rich and poor his highest priority. Guess what? The Gini co-efficient (as measured by the Census Bureau), the Left\u2019s favorite measure of income inequality, rose each of Obama\u2019s first four years in office, breaking all time-highs in both 2011 and 2012, and it remains high.\n\n\u2022 Where are the new small businesses? According to an analysis by the Kauffman Index of Entrepreneurial Activity, the rate of business creation dipped to just 0.28 percent of all adults in 2013. It\u2019s been more than a decade \u2013 2001 \u2013 since business creation rates were this low. The Census Bureau tracks the number of newly created firms. The latest available data (2012) shows creation only slightly rebounding from the recession lows.\n\n\u2022 American Dream goes bust. A 2014 Pew Research Poll found only 34 percent of Americans think their children will be better off than they are. This pessimism contrasts sharply with the Obama rosy scenario.\n\n\u2022 $7.3 trillion added to the debt. When Barack Obama entered office the national debt was under $11 trillion. Now it\u2019s more than $18 trillion \u2013 more than $120,000 for each worker. It will be $19 trillion when he leaves office. Mr. Obama has added more debt to the nation than every President from George Washington through Bill Clinton. Who will pay these bills?\n\n\u2022 The kids are not alright. The percentage of Americans under age 25 who are in the workforce has fallen to its lowest level since the early 1970s \u2013 which was before women started entering the workforce in very large numbers. The percentage of working Americans ages 25-29 is at the lowest level since 1982 \u2013 the earliest data online provided by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The real unemployment rate in America is near 10 percent when accounting for these lost workers who have given up.\n\n\u2022 Families are still breaking up. A key to a healthy economy and rising incomes is keeping families intact. But marriages are breaking up, and there is almost universal agreement that a big contributor to poverty is family break-up. Children living in homes without a father present are three times more likely to live in poverty than intact families. Marriage is one of the greatest anti-poverty programs. W. Brad Wilcox of the American Enterprise Institute and Robert I. Lerman of the Urban Institute estimate that \u201cyoung men and women from intact families enjoy an annual \u2018intact-family premium\u2019 that amounts to $6,500 and $4,700, respectively, over the incomes of their peers from single-parent families.\u201d Yet, since 1970, the percentage of children living in single-parent households has skyrocketed from nearly 12 percent to more than 25 percent. The unwed birth rate has remained at all-time highs of nearly 40 percent.\n\n\u2022 Entitlement spending will nearly double. Spending on Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and Obamacare is estimated to nearly double in 2024 compared with 2013.\n\n\u2022 Government dependency rising. The Census Bureau says more than one in three people live in families receiving federal welfare benefits. Of course, that\u2019s not counting non-means-tested programs such as Social Security or unemployment. Add in those programs, and half of families get a government check.\n\n\u2022 Students are awash in debt. According to analysis by the Institute for College Access & Success of U.S. Department of Education data, the number of college students graduating with student loan debt increased from fewer than half in 1993 to more than 70 percent in 2012, and the average burden increased from under $10,000 in 1993 to nearly $30,000 in 2012.\n\nAmericans sense that a recovery built on trillions of dollars of debt, overspending and trillions more in easy money is a house of sand. Mr. Obama\u2019s only economic ideas are to redistribute wealth, via ever-rising taxes, from the productive class and the job creators to everyone else. If Republicans let him, things will get worse for everyone before they get better.\n\nStephen Moore is chief economist at the Heritage Foundation\n\nand a Fox News contributor.", "article_metadata": {"geo.placename": "Santa Ana", "geo.region": "US-CA", "content_section": "commentary", "description": "Opinion: Stephen Moore: If economic crisis over, why do we still feel bad? | families, percent, obama, americans, debt, rate, economic, recession, trillion, bureau", "geo.position": "33.745573;-117.867834", "author": "STEPHEN MOORE", "og": {"site_name": "The Orange County Register", "description": "The big news from the president\u2019s State of the Union address is that the economic \u201ccrisis is over.\u201d Apparently, we\u2019ve been rescued from a second Great Depression, and everything this president has done to fix the economy has worked.
