Johannes Sonny Susanto of Pentecostal Mawar Sharon Church. \u201cLet them put their trust in you and know that you are a good God.\u201d\n\nAmen was echoed by those in the pews.\n\nIt is not clear what caused the Singapore-bound plane to plummet into the Java Sea 42 minutes after taking off from Surabaya, Indonesia\u2019s second-largest city, last Sunday. Minutes before losing contact, the pilot told air traffic control he was approaching threatening clouds, but was denied permission to climb to a higher altitude because of heavy air traffic.\n\nDespite a massive international search and recovery operation, so far only 31 bodies have been found, in large because of bad weather. But officials said after locating what appears to be a massive part of the fuselage, it is possible many remaining passengers and crew will be found inside the wreck.\n\nDivers waited for breaks in weather Sunday to reach the site, but rolling seas stirred up silt and mud, leaving them with zero visibility, said Henry Bambang Soelistyo, chief of the National Search and Rescue Agency.\n\nThey had to turn back because conditions were so bad.\n\n\u201cAt this moment, it\u2019s impossible to send any divers,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll wait until the weather gets better.\u201d\n\nTwenty planes and helicopters were being deployed Sunday together with 27 ships from Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, the United States searching for the all-important black boxes and pieces of wreckage.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Prayers held as divers wait to check AirAsia site", "author": "Eileen Ng", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Prayers held as divers wait to check AirAsia site", "title": "Prayers held as divers wait to check AirAsia site", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/01/04/prayers_held_as_divers_wait_to_check_airasia_site/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/01/indonesia-plane.jpeg29-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Prayers held as divers wait to check AirAsia site", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/01/indonesia-plane.jpeg29-1280x960.jpg", "title": "Prayers held as divers wait to check AirAsia site", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Prayers held as divers wait to check AirAsia site", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cGod, we pray that you will give the grieving families extraordinary strength and help ease their pain,\u201d said the Rev.\nDespite a massive international search and recovery operation, so far only 31 bodies have been found, in large because of bad weather.\n\u201cLet them put their trust in you and know that you are a good God.\u201dAmen was echoed by those in the pews.\n\u201cAt this moment, it\u2019s impossible to send any divers,\u201d he said.\nDivers waited for breaks in weather Sunday to reach the site, but rolling seas stirred up silt and mud, leaving them with zero visibility, said Henry Bambang Soelistyo, chief of the National Search and Rescue Agency."}
