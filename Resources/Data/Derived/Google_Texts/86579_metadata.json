The latest Gallup shows that the number of Americans who believe that big government is the biggest threat to the United States has been increasing in a rather steady fashion.\n\nAccording to Gallup, 72% percent of Americans now believe that big government is the number one threat to the country. The poll also demonstrated that only 21% of Americans now believe that big business is the major issue. The historical high choosing big business over big government or big labor, 38%, was registered in 2002.\n\nGallup\u2019s analysis shows that government policies specific to the period are seen as major factors behind people\u2019s decisions. Since Barack Obama took office, his \u201cnew economic patriotism\u201d turned on the \u201ctrickle-down ideology,\u201d as Timothy P. Carney put it, by boosting the good old system of bumping money into big businesses \u201cin the hope this money will trickle down.\u201d Aside from the obvious failures of Obama\u2019s \u201ctrickle-down\u201d method, Edward Snowden\u2019s revelations concerning the NSA surveillance program and the various scandals regarding the poor implementation of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s health care exchange website, may also have served as factors linked to the recent increase in the number of Americans distrustful of their government.\n\nWhile Republicans are usually the ones mostly concerned about the effects of big government policies, what has truly caught everybody\u2019s eye in the latest poll is the increasing number of democrats and independents who have picked big government as the biggest threat yet.\n\nAccording to Gallup, 92% of Republicans say big government is the problem, followed by 71% of independents and 56% of Democrats.\n\nThat\u2019s right. 56% of Democrats think big government is the greatest threat to Americans.\n\nThe steady increase of the number of Americans voicing their opinions regarding the negative effects of big government policies indicates that, soon, we might be witnessing a shift in the way we pick our candidates.\n\nAmericans are now aware of the big failure of big government and are fully mindful of how harmful the consequences of heavy-handed intervention can be.\n\nAmericans respond to the different political environments of the times but have consistently viewed big government as a major threat ever since Gallup started asking the question, back in 1965. This trend could continue to present itself as a sign that Americans are now watching more closely, and might not tolerate another administration addicted to heavy-handed interventionism in all aspects of our lives.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Barack Obama,big business,Big Government,big labor,corporations,Economy,freedom,Gallup,labor unions,Liberty,ObamaCare,Politics,News,Blog,Current,Alternative,Libertarian,Election,Nonpartisan,Ron Paul", "robots": "index,follow", "description": "big governmentSince Barack Obama took office in 2009, more Americans say that big government is a much greater threat to the country than big business.
