Or will hackers sabotage a major chemical plant this year? Answers to these questions may surprise you because they\u2019re slightly counterintuitive.\n\nMany of the nation\u2019s most-at-risk \u201ccritical infrastructure\u201d sites \u2013 like power plants and chemical facilities \u2013 have analog redundancies in place that ensure catastrophic cyber-attacks won\u2019t halt operations. For now.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut as connectivity increases and as electric grids become \u201csmarter\u201d through efficiency and automation measures, they will only become more and more linked to the internet \u2013 and more at risk of infiltration.\n\nThe good news is that we seem to have stumbled upon a short window of time where the government can work with U.S. critical infrastructure sites to beef up both cyber and physical security. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is taking the lead in assessing these vulnerabilities \u2013 with the private sector \u2013 as fast as they can.\n\nJust last month, DHS released information about a U.S. public utility that was infiltrated. The Department worked quickly with the company to enhance security \u201cbefore there was any impact to operations.\u201d For once, we\u2019ve got a plan in place to address what most experts suggest will be an ongoing problem.\n\nThe not-so-good news is that some industry partners aren\u2019t comfortable or willing to partner with the government, even though attacks on U.S. utility companies are increasing steadily. California\u2019s Energy Commission chairman was quoted recently as saying, \u201cIf you\u2019re a utility today, depending on your scale, you\u2019re under attack at this moment.\u201d Voluntary public-private partnerships remain the principal mechanism for managing critical infrastructure risk.\n\nWhile there are still arguments over which government agency should \u201cown\u201d the cyber mission, the one responsible for protecting America\u2019s energy sector, wastewater facilities and even public transportation systems is Homeland Security.\n\nFor most people, cybersecurity is a complicated subject \u2013 especially when the government is involved. But it doesn\u2019t have to be. What exactly is your government doing to keep you safe? Here\u2019s what DHS is and isn\u2019t doing to protect against a cyber \u201cPearl Harbor.\u201d\n\n1. What does DHS do in the cybersecurity world?\n\nDHS\u2019s role is to bring together all stakeholders\u2014government officials and business leaders, security professionals and infrastructure owners and operators\u2014to share information and best practices to reduce and manage cyber risk.\n\nTo do that, DHS set up a space called the National Cybersecurity and Communications and Integration Center (NCCIC) where the private sector can sit with DHS and FBI analysts to talk directly to each other and respond to threats in real time.\n\nAs part of that Center, DHS maintains the US Computer Emergency Readiness Team \u2013 a 24 hour cyber operations center that responds to incidents, provides technical assistance and notifications about current and potential security threats and vulnerabilities.\n\nThrough this center, DHS offers threat details and analysis that is non-attributable and anonymized to private sector companies who ask for it and help companies create assessments to understand if there are security gaps that can be fixed.\n\nAt the same time, DHS conducts regular Privacy Impact Assessments, which are released to the public, about its cyber operations and data minimization efforts.\n\n2. What doesn\u2019t DHS do?\n\nDHS doesn\u2019t track the systems of companies that haven\u2019t signed up to partner through a mutual agreement and it does not have any so-called \u201coffensive\u201d ability to launch cyber-attacks.\n\nThe Department doesn\u2019t force a company to change its cyber security methods, and working with the Department is completely voluntary.\n\nDHS doesn\u2019t view the systems of all critical infrastructure businesses. Unfortunately, that means they don\u2019t have a complete threat picture. The more private sector groups partner with DHS, the easier it will be to see threat trends and be able to address them in real time.\n\nThe Department is responsible for and scans the systems on federal networks, but cannot fix problems. They can only alert tech teams in each particular Department or Agency. This argues for greater authority or binding guidance from OMB so that DHS can address intrusions.\n\n\n\n3. What will DHS do in the future?\n\nDHS computer systems will automatically send and receive cyber threat information to private sector partners, based on current threat conditions. Its systems will get \u201csmarter\u201d as it is exposed to new threats.\n\n4. Why does DHS have a cyber role at all? Just because the Department is responsible for protecting critical infrastructure doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s capable of adding in preventing cyber-attacks, right?\n\nThe Homeland Security Act requires DHS to assess vulnerabilities to critical infrastructure, which has naturally evolved to include cyber security. Plus, as a result of a variety of other homeland security efforts, like border security, the Department has developed impressive cyber capabilities.\n\nFor example, Immigration and Customs Enforcement has a Cyber Crimes Unit that focuses on transnational criminal organizations that use the internet for narcotics trafficking and illegal imports. And the Secret Service is tasked by Congress to investigate certain financial computer crimes (its original mandate was to investigate financial fraud). So the capacity has been evolving for a long time.\n\nThe bottom line: over the past few years, DHS has built successful partnerships and experience to protect critical infrastructure. Now, the mission is shifting from a sole focus on protection (i.e. building stronger firewalls) to building resilience into the networks, systems, and assets that America relies on for the delivery of essential functions and services. DHS is even encouraging innovators to adopt a resilient and secure by design principle.\n\nNo government effort will ever be perfect, and the Department has certainly made a few mistakes that have made some wary of trusting it. But the DHS deserves credit for thinking about the long-game and making progress in the absence of cyber legislation.\n\nKing is the national security adviser to the president and CEO of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "We seem to have stumbled upon a short window of time where the government can work with U.S. critical infrastructure sites to beef up both cyber and physical security.", "description": "We seem to have stumbled upon a short window of time where the government can work with U.S. critical infrastructure sites to beef up both cyber and physical security.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Congress Blog"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "We seem to have stumbled upon a short window of time where the government can work with U.S. critical infrastructure sites to beef up both cyber and physical security.", "title": "DHS 'dos and don'ts' on cybersecurity", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/homeland-security/212853-dhs-dos-and-donts-on-cybersecurity", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T04:20:37-05:00", "type": "article"}, "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T04:20-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/homeland-security/212853-dhs-dos-and-donts-on-cybersecurity", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2014-07-21T16:00-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Joe Picard", "author": "Meg King", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-21T16:00:02-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T04:20:37-05:00"}, "keywords": ",,", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/homeland-security/212853-dhs-dos-and-donts-on-cybersecurity", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "We seem to have stumbled upon a short window of time where the government can work with U.S. critical infrastructure sites to beef up both cyber and physical security.", "card": "summary", "title": "DHS 'dos and don'ts' on cybersecurity"}, "dcterms.title": "DHS 'dos and don'ts' on cybersecurity"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe4a54\"", "article_summary": "The Homeland Security Act requires DHS to assess vulnerabilities to critical infrastructure, which has naturally evolved to include cyber security.\nDHS computer systems will automatically send and receive cyber threat information to private sector partners, based on current threat conditions.\nThe bottom line: over the past few years, DHS has built successful partnerships and experience to protect critical infrastructure.\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is taking the lead in assessing these vulnerabilities \u2013 with the private sector \u2013 as fast as they can.\nWhat doesn\u2019t DHS do?"}
