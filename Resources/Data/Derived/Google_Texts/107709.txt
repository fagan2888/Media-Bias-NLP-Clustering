Friends and family are mourning the loss of a prominent community leader.

Bobby Roberts died Sunday morning at a hospital in Hattiesburg, Mississippi. He’d been there for the past month recovering from heart surgery.

Roberts is the founder of Roberts Financial Planning Services in Panama City. He also served as local chairman of the Republican party and National Vice President of the Jaycees.

Saturday, his wife Elise wrote this on her Facebook page:

“Thanks to all who have called and are praying for Bobby. He is still in intensive care in the Wesley Hospital in Hattiesburg, Miss. He is making a slow recovery after four weeks in ITC”.

Friends got a call about his death around 8:30 a.m.

"When I got the call this morning, it was kind of a shock and rejoicing,” said former GOP chairman Arthur Cullen. He visited Roberts in the hospital just a few weeks ago.

“Bobby was such a good guy and we're going to miss him greatly here in our community. There's not many people that have been able to impact a community like Bobby Roberts has. But I also rejoice with him today because I know where he is and he's in a much better place than we are today."

Roberts also spent a few years working at Newschannel 7.
