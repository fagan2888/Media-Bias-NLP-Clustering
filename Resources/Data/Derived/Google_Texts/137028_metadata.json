In April, DeMint\u2019s counterpart at a rival conservative think tank was visiting the Dalai Lama.\n\n\u201cI went to set up the collaboration in his monastery in Dharamsala, India,\u201d Arthur Brooks, president of the American Enterprise Institute, said in a recent interview with CQ Roll Call. \u201cI meditated for half a day in his monastery and met with him in the afternoon.\u201d\n\nIn his downtown Washington, D.C., office, wearing a black blazer with a checkered pocket square, slim-fit jeans and argyle socks, Brooks paused and smiled, as if relishing the audacity of it all: a conservative figurehead traversing a continent to convince the Buddhist spiritual leader to participate in an upcoming AEI campaign about \u201chuman flourishing and happiness.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is the new right,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the new right.\u201d\n\nIn his former life, Brooks was an academic, writing books and teaching courses on the virtues of the free-enterprise system, for which he calls himself a \u201cwarrior\"; before that, he was a professional French horn player with a renowned orchestra in Barcelona.\n\nSince Jan. 1, 2009, Brooks has helmed the AEI, a prestigious powerhouse of conservative intellectualism, where he wants to lead a revolution to transform the Republican Party of the 21st century.\n\nHis school of thought is this: Republicans are constantly hammered by the left for being the party of haters, especially haters of the poor.\n\nBrooks argues any conservative who subscribes to the philosophy of the free-enterprise system subscribes to the system inherently designed to do the most good for the most people. But that message isn\u2019t resonating with voters, and Brooks said it\u2019s because conservatives aren\u2019t talking about it the right way.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s any distinction between the approach that I\u2019m taking and what anybody else around town at any time has been taking, it\u2019s the emphasis on the \u2018why\u2019 of our movement,\u201d Brooks said, \u201cand trying to look at the deep moral truths that enable our free-enterprise system to bestow its blessings on you and me and everybody else, especially those who aren\u2019t as lucky as you and me.\u201d\n\nTake, for instance, how Brooks recently spun the debate over entitlement programs.\n\n\u201cThe reason we have to reform entitlement is we are going to become insolvent, and if we\u2019re insolvent we have austerity, and if we have austerity, it hurts the poor the most and imperils the safety net,\u201d he said. \u201cThe social safety net is one of the greatest achievements in our society and we have to fight for it.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s his conservative clincher: \u201cAnd that means not extending it to 70 percent of the population.\u201d\n\nAnd, for the Democrats who paint Republicans as caring only for those with money, Brooks has a talking point for that, too.\n\n\u201cPeople who are stronger than we are, people who are really rich ... they don\u2019t need my protections,\u201d he said. \u201cThe people who need me and our movement are the people who are stuck in failing schools ... [or] unable to find jobs. These people are stuck in cycles of dependence, marginalized on the basis of growing statism and the free-enterprise system has not been extended to them aggressively enough.\u201d\n\nBrooks called free enterprise \u201can act of global brotherhood.\u201d\n\nOf course, convincing conservatives that they need to message differently is an exercise in undoing decades of learned behavior, and Brooks, who is actually registered as a political independent, said it requires patience. Brooks said he has a 10-year goal of making free enterprise a \"settled issue\" in America, \"like civil rights are today.\"\n\nBrooks and his AEI colleagues make frequent trips to Capitol Hill for meetings, presentations and congressional hearings. He said he has forged relationships with influential House GOP lawmakers who \u201cget\u201d his message. Brooks referred to many of them by their first names: Eric, as in Majority Leader Cantor, for example, or Paul, as in Budget Chairman Ryan.\n\nThat familiarity might not extend itself in the reverse, however \u2014 at least not yet. In conversations with CQ Roll Call, many prominent House Republicans and their aides said the name \u201cArthur Brooks\u201d was familiar but didn\u2019t evoke any strong feelings other than that he and the AEI continued to do good work.\n\nBut if Brooks has some work to do in making his name a household one, the time might be right.\n\nThere\u2019s a new interest in expanding the GOP base, which necessitates building a reputation of a more inclusive Republican Party. Brooks is all about that, and he\u2019s caught the eye of Rep. Renee Ellmers of North Carolina, who is also looking to change the party from within.\n\n\u201cHis perspective is from a real, scientific research-based perspective of how people listen to an emotional message before they can grasp the facts of the situation and how [Republicans] really should be doing a better job that way,\u201d said Ellmers, the chairwoman of the Republican Women\u2019s Policy Committee.\n\nAs part of her effort to make the GOP more palatable to women in an election year, Ellmers arranged for the AEI to be a partner of the RWPC beginning in early 2014. The think tank will meet regularly with the committee, offering targeted policy analyses, messaging strategies and polling data.\n\nBrooks also could have an \u201cin\u201d with influential congressional Republicans whose relationship with the Heritage Foundation has soured, due in part to the aggressive tactics of its advocacy arm, Heritage Action for America.\n\nDeMint, in an interview with CQ Roll Call, downplayed the House GOP\u2019s frustration with his organization, as well as the differences between how he runs his shop and how Brooks runs his.\n\nHe called Brooks a \u201cleader\u201d in the conservative movement, though, with a gift for driving the message home: \u201cI came out of the marketing and advertising business, and I\u2019ve been frustrated for a long time that the ideas that I know work and are better for people are not being communicated.\u201d\n\nBrooks conceded that Heritage is \u201ccreating conflict\u201d on the Hill, but he stressed that he was a yearly donor and a great admirer of the think tank\u2019s work.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s the thing we should be really super happy about,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are happy or unhappy with what Heritage is doing, or what AEI is doing ... but you know what? I guarantee you there will not be a knock in the night and a jackbooted thug at my door. And I run what is arguably the most important conservative institution outside of government in America today.\n\n\u201cThat is a miracle,\u201d Brooks continued. \u201cThat is something that I\u2019m so grateful for every day.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "In August, Heritage Foundation President Jim DeMint was traveling through GOP-friendly districts, urging Congress to defund Obamacare.
