Saturday, Harley Davidson of Panama City Beach sponsored a charity "Ride United" motorcycle event for the United Way of Northwest Florida.

Dozens of motorcycle enthusiasts paid $25 s as a registration fee, which included a t-shirt, lunch, and entertainment.

United Way of Northwest Florida helps support other non-profits throughout the community.

Bryan Taylor, the CEO of the United Way Northwest Florida said,

"Why a motorcycle ride? Why not. Ride united, its a way that united way and Harley Davidson can show our partnership to the community and it's a way for Harley customers, fans and supporters to support United Way."

Taylor said although this is the first time they've hosted a motorcycle ride they're pleased with the turn out, and believe the event will continue to grow larger each year.
