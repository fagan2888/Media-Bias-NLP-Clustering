Working as an independent contractor -- as opposed to being an employee -- puts you at a significant disadvantage when the tax man comes calling. You\u2019re also likely to miss out on more affordable health care coverage. But if a few whiffs of the gig economy\u2019s intoxicating aroma has you hooked, here are some tips.\n\n1. Make Sure You\u2019re Not \u201cMisclassified\u201d\n\nMisclassification runs rampant in American business. To save money, some companies classify their workers as independent contractors even though they function as employees. Simply put, unless you\u2019re being showered with cash specifically because of your ability to work independently, it\u2019s better in the long run to be an employee. Among other things, you\u2019re able to earn overtime pay, collect unemployment insurance if you lose the job and not got screwed on taxes (more on that later). If you\u2019re not able to work full-time, don\u2019t worry. You can still be an employee and work part-time. Before getting hired, it\u2019s worth asking if you can be an employee.\n\nOf course, the boss might just say no. In that case, if you\u2019re stuck as an independent contractor but feel like you\u2019re an employee, it may be worth filing a complaint with your state\u2019s labor department. State laws vary on the topic and they aren\u2019t always fully enforced, but they generally tend to favor workers. The U.S. Department of Labor even went on record this summer saying \u201cmost workers as employees.\u201d You shouldn\u2019t get penalized at work for filing a complaint. If your boss retaliates, he\u2019s in violation of federal law.\n\n2. Get Healthcare\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nIn the United States, health insurance is famously tied to employment. Not all is lost if you\u2019re a freelancer, though. If you\u2019re younger than 26, thanks to the Affordable Care Act, you can stay on the health insurance policy of a parent. That applies even if you\u2019re financially independent or married. It\u2019s likely the most cost-effective option.\n\nIf you\u2019re 26 or older, then you\u2019ll have to buy insurance on your own. For coverage starting in 2016, open enrollment doesn\u2019t begin until November 1. Before then, you can do some research into the different policies available in your state -- this nifty website, Healthcare.gov, will connect you. It all depends on what sort of plan you\u2019re looking for, but if you\u2019re healthy and looking to save some money, consider a high-deductible plan with low premiums. In insurance-speak, that\u2019s known as a \u201cbronze plan.\u201d Basically, you want to avoid paying for coverage you\u2019re not using all that much.\n\nA good tool for browsing insurance plans tailored for independent contractors is the Freelancers Union website. Despite the group\u2019s title, it\u2019s not a union in the traditional sense; it doesn\u2019t do any bargaining or sign contracts on behalf of members. The Freelancers Union actually used to offer its own plan in New York for union members, but that became financially impossible under the Affordable Care Act.\n\n3. Keep Track Of Your Business Expenses\n\nIt\u2019s critically important to keep track of all your work-related expenses. If you\u2019re driving for Lyft, then hold on to the receipts you get from gas stations and car washes; if you\u2019re a Postmates courier, do the same for all the buses and subways you take; if you\u2019re working from home, keep track of how much you spend on phone and internet. All of this will come in handy during your annual tax return, since you can deduct all these as business expenses. If you\u2019re unsure that something counts as such an expense, keep track of it anyway and decide later. It\u2019s better to have too many records than too few.\n\n4. Pay Your Taxes--Four Times A Year\n\nPeople are supposed to pay taxes as they earn income. If you\u2019re employed, then your boss effectively does this for you, deducting taxes from your paychecks. But if you\u2019re an independent contractor, you need to do it on your own -- or you could be charged penalties and interest to the IRS when you file your tax return in April. The government has a timetable for these so-called \u201cestimated tax\u201d obligations, with due dates four times a year, and you can file electronically. It\u2019s tempting to think you can just settle your tab in April, but it\u2019s not worth it. If you owe Uncle Sam $1,000 or more -- and if you\u2019re having anything resembling success as a freelancer, you will -- then you\u2019ll be saddled with extra debt for not paying on time.\n\nFiling taxes is tricky enough for those who aren\u2019t self-employed. And tax preparation software like Turbo Tax can make the process easier. But depending on your financial means, it may be worth simply paying for a real-live human accountant to help sort through all this.\n\n\u201cIt depends if people understand what they\u2019re reading,\u201d says Jonathan Medows, a New York City-based CPA who works with freelancers. But if you\u2019re having trouble making sense of the sort of questions the software asks, he says, get an accountant.\n\nOverall, Medows says, \u201cit\u2019s important to take yourself seriously as a business.\u201d Making the right moves over taxes and healthcare -- not to mention, making sure your boss follows labor laws -- can save you headaches and cash.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://s2.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "millennial money, working as a freelancer, tips for working in gig economy, tips for working in sharing economy, tips for working in on-demand economy, sharing economy labor, working sharing economy, working for uber, working in on-demand economy", "og": {"site_name": "International Business Times", "description": "The informal motto of the on-demand economy has a nice ring to it: \u201cBe your own boss.\u201d But going out on your own is far from simple.", "title": "How To Make It In The Gig Economy: 4 Tips For Freelancers", "url": "http://www.ibtimes.com/how-make-it-gig-economy-4-tips-freelancers-2117069", "image": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2015/09/28/rtx1l94s.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The informal motto of the on-demand economy has a nice ring to it: \u201cBe your own boss.\u201d But going out on your own is far from simple.", "title": "How To Make It In The Gig Economy: 4 Tips For Freelancers", "url": "http://www.ibtimes.com/how-make-it-gig-economy-4-tips-freelancers-2117069", "image": {"src": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2015/09/28/rtx1l94s.jpg", "identifier": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2015/09/28/rtx1l94s.jpg"}, "site": "@IBTimes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "fb": {"app_id": 263851690471857, "pages": 128026713884051}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/IBTimes", "section": "Business", "published_time": "2015-10-01T06:04:07-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-08T10:22:03-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The informal motto of the on-demand economy has a nice ring to it: \u201cBe your own boss.\u201d But going out on your own is far from simple."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce9ea\"", "article_summary": "But if a few whiffs of the gig economy\u2019s intoxicating aroma has you hooked, here are some tips.\nThe informal motto of the on-demand economy has a nice ring to it: \u201cBe your own boss.\u201d But if you want to scrape together a living by driving for Uber, delivering groceries for Instacart or buying rich people coffee at Postmates, the struggle can make Sisyphus\u2019 gig seem cushy.\nBut if you\u2019re having trouble making sense of the sort of questions the software asks, he says, get an accountant.\n\u201cIt depends if people understand what they\u2019re reading,\u201d says Jonathan Medows, a New York City-based CPA who works with freelancers.\nTo save money, some companies classify their workers as independent contractors even though they function as employees."}
