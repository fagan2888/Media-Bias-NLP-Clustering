We’re still 18 months away from the general presidential election, and the short list of candidates is already pulling in major endorsements. Yet it’s been endorsements from those outside the political bubble that have been catching the attention of wonks.

A couple of legal Nevada brothels are throwing their hats into the political arena for 2016. Take for instance, one right outside of Las Vegas — Sheri’s Ranch. Workers there sent out an endorsement for Nevada’s Democratic Senator Harry Reid, with an offer to host the Senator’s retirement party.

Meanwhile the women from Dennis Hof’s HBO-famous Moonlite Bunny Ranch are taking a step further. Earlier this month the workers there launched a web site called “Hookers for Hillary,” endorsing, obviously, the Democratic front-runner and presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton.

According to the women at the ranch, the main reason they’re supporting Clinton is her stance on the Affordable Care Act, which has given legal prostitutes in Nevada the option to purchase health care.

“With any Republican in office, they’re likely to repeal [the ac] and I don’t think it’s fair that we shouldn’t be able to purchase health care, since we pay into taxes like everybody else,” explains Krissy Summers, an employee at the Bunny Ranch and part of the campaign.

Summers and other Bunny Ranch colleagues told Come Here And Say That that their group is so diverse, it felt as if they were part of Hillary Clinton’s campaign launch video. We wanted to see it for ourselves, so, like in Clinton’s video, we asked the women what they were looking forward to in 2016. Check out our version above.
