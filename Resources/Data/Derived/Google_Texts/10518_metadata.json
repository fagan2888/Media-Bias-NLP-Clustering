Andrus is now the longest-tenured position player in Texas.\n\nGame 3 against the Blue Jays is Sunday night in Texas.\n\nLeft-hander Martin Perez (3-6) pitches for the Rangers in the potential clincher. Marco Estrada (13-8), who held hitters to an MLB-low .183 batting average after the all-star break, starts for Toronto.\n\n\u201cWe need a big outburst with the bats, score a lot of runs,\u201d Blue Jays manager John Gibbons said. \u201cWe score in bunches.
