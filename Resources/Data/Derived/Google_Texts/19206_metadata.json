Thompson, center second right, listen as Gov. Chris Christie, center back, addresses a gathering of Camden High School students. Mel Evans/Associated Press\n\nNew Jersey Gov. Chris Christie announced plans Tuesday to spend at least $50 million to renovate Camden High School and update its technology, the latest in a series of efforts to turn around the poor city\u2019s failing schools.\n\nFamilies and educators have long complained about the district\u2019s crumbling buildings, including the high school, which was built in 1918. The funding will come from the New Jersey Schools Development Authority, which uses bond money to build and repair schools in urban areas.\n\nMr. Christie has been to Camden repeatedly over the last year, positioning himself as a Republican who cares about struggling cities even while he gets few votes in them. Last year he took over the troubled Camden schools and appointed a new superintendent, who has said the dilapidated conditions held students back and demoralized them.\n\nSuperintendent Paymon Rouhanifard said Tuesday he aimed to create four small learning communities within the high school, with one focused on career and technical education.\n\nState data for Camden High School say that in 2012-13, only 47% of students graduated in four years and few were deemed ready for college. The school has about 800 students this year.\n\nThe Schools Development Authority is also planning a $130.5 million construction of a new high school in Trenton.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "New Jersey Gov.
