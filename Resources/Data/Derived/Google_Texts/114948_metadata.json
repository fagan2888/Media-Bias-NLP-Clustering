It would add 10 to 15 minutes,\u201d Ed Kirkwood, township manager, said of the possible detour's impact.\n\nPennDOT District 10 bridge engineer Jim Andrews said PennDOT has begun the preliminary engineering process for the replacement of the bridge. \u201cAt this time, the project is not funded for construction,\u201d he said.\n\nPennDOT's bridge project manager Ray Smith wrote the township in late July saying, \u201cThis bridge could be considered a redundant bridge. There is another crossing about 2,000 feet to the west and another about 3,000 feet to the east. Therefore we are considering closing this bridge and vacating the property.\u201d\n\nThe bridge has collision damage and cannot be repaired, Smith said.\n\n\u201cA repair plan would include constructing a new superstructure,\u201d Smith wrote to Kirkwood.\n\nIn a lengthy response letter to PennDOT, Kirkwood detailed problems a bridge closing could cause.\n\nVehicles from the township's three volunteer fire departments would have to detour to get into the new Wyncrest Estates development in the township's northwest section, he said.\n\nThose same detours also would delay police response, he said.\n\nThe detours take vehicles outside Butler Township and onto Lions Road in neighboring Center, which Kirkwood said is a secondary road that floods easily.\n\nA closed Lions Road bridge would slow trips by commuters and shoppers, Kirkwood said.\n\n\u201cIt will impact the drive to work for many people and people shopping at Moraine Point Plaza, Butler Commons and Butler Crossing,\u201d Kirkwood said.\n\nIt would also make clearing roads of snow and ice longer and more costly, Kirkwood said.\n\n\u201cThe suggested alternative roads are hazardous in good weather and treacherous in the winter,\u201d he said.\n\nRick Wills is a staff writer for Trib Total Media.
