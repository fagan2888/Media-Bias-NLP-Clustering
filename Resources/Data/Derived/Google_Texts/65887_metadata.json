The new initiatives come as Maduro\u2019s approval ratings have plunged into the low 30 percent range, and his party prepares for congressional elections next year.\n\nMaduro recently announced that his administration had taken over warehouses where \u201cbourgeois criminals\u201d were hoarding food and medical supplies. He also increased the maximum prison sentence for smugglers to 14 years.\n\nOfficials say the state has arrested more than 1,000 smugglers since Venezuela began closing its border with Colombia each night.\n\nThe administration blames shortages on black-market vendors who buy groceries at government-regulated prices and illegally resell them for high profits and on an \u201ceconomic war\u201d it says is being waged by hostile, speculating companies. Critics say the problems are the result of excessive government intervention in the economy and smuggling that is tacitly endorsed by security forces.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Shortages, inflation threaten Venezuela Christmas", "title": "Shortages, inflation threaten Venezuela Christmas", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Shortages, inflation threaten Venezuela Christmas", "title": "Shortages, inflation threaten Venezuela Christmas", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/11/01/shortages_inflation_threaten_venezuela_christmas/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/venezuela-shortages.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Shortages, inflation threaten Venezuela Christmas", "title": "Shortages, inflation threaten Venezuela Christmas", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/venezuela-shortages.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Hannah Dreier", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: From the Wires, NewsCARACAS, Venezuela (AP) \u2014 Venezuela is stepping up efforts to combat shortages and rising prices so families can have a merry Christmas complete with 12-cent sacks of sugar and 50-cent chickens.\nThe move is part of expanded effort to combat chronic shortages, smuggling, and runaway inflation that are putting great stress on consumers in the socialist Latin American country.\nOfficials say the state has arrested more than 1,000 smugglers since Venezuela began closing its border with Colombia each night.\nMaduro recently announced that his administration had taken over warehouses where \u201cbourgeois criminals\u201d were hoarding food and medical supplies.\n\u201cToday we deploy, and in November and December you will see that we have guaranteed a happy Christmas for the people,\u201d he said during televised remarks."}
