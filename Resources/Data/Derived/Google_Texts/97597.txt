U.S. Xpress, Inc., is partnering with Habitat for Humanity of Greater Chattanooga Area in the 2015 Mud Run. This is the second consecutive year that U.S. Xpress, Inc. has sponsored teams in the charity event.

Habitat for Humanity of Greater Chattanooga Area is a non-profit organization that partners with hard-working, low-income families in Chattanooga. The charity builds and finances new, safe, and affordable homes making homeownership possible for families who are unable to qualify in a traditional manner.

All proceeds from the Mud Run will be used to provide lowincome families with safe housing. The Mud Run posed a fun way for U.S. Xpress to involve employees in team-building and even trigger light-hearted competition with executives all while supporting a good cause.

“U.S. Xpress is proud to sponsor our employees, who eagerly volunteered to contribute to a cause that benefits the Chattanooga Community,” said Amanda Thompson, VP of Human resources at U.S. Xpress, Inc.
