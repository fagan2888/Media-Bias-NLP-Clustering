When in doubt, you or your pharmacist should check first with your insurer. Note, too, that your insurance plan may have age limitations, for example, most plans will not cover the shingles vaccines for adults under age 60. If you\u2019re paying out-of-pocket, know that prices vary depending on the pharmacy, just as they do at your doctor\u2019s office. For example, you\u2019ll pay $85 for the pneumonia vaccine at CVS and Target, but just $73 at Costco pharmacies. And the dual Hepatitis A and B vaccine costs $169 at Target, and $114 at Walmart. Ask your pharmacist to forward information about your vaccinations to your doctor's office so that it can be added to your medical record.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "health, drugs, prevention, preventative care, Affordable Care Act, vaccines, vaccinations, immunizations, pharmacy, wellness, Conditions & Treatments", "Title": "Getting Vaccinated at the Pharmacy - Consumer Reports", "og": {"url": "http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/news/2015/07/should-you-get-vaccines-at-the-pharmacy/index.htm", "image": "http://www.consumerreports.org/content/dam/cro/news_articles/health/CRO_Health_Vaccine_in_Arm_07-15.png", "type": "article", "title": "Getting Vaccinated at the Pharmacy - Consumer Reports"}, "robots": "INDEX,FOLLOW", "publishDate": "2015-07-14T10:00Z", "primarytag": "Health", "last-modified": "2015-07-15T14:49Z", "fb": {"app_id": 551478298314138}, "searchTitle": "Consumer Reports: Getting Vaccinated at the Pharmacy - Consumer Reports", "keywords": "health, drugs, prevention, preventative care, Affordable Care Act, vaccines, vaccinations, immunizations, pharmacy, wellness, Conditions & Treatments", "contenttag": "Conditions & Treatments", "description": "Consumer Reports experts share what you need to know before getting vaccines at the pharmacy."}, "article_summary": "If you\u2019re paying out-of-pocket, know that prices vary depending on the pharmacy, just as they do at your doctor\u2019s office.\nAsk your pharmacist to forward information about your vaccinations to your doctor's office so that it can be added to your medical record.\nFor example, you\u2019ll pay $85 for the pneumonia vaccine at CVS and Target, but just $73 at Costco pharmacies.\nAnd the dual Hepatitis A and B vaccine costs $169 at Target, and $114 at Walmart.\nAs at your doctor\u2019s office, most pharmacies will file with your insurance, and under the Affordable Care Act, insurers are required to cover most immunizations for adults and children, so you probably won\u2019t be charged."}
