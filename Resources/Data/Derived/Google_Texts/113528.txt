Carly Fiorina turned to her own battle with cancer when asked about President Obama’s healthcare law at Tuesday night’s Republican debate on Fox Business.

The former CEO of Hewlett-Packard was asked what the alternative would be if she repealed Obamacare. She answered by discussing her own health history.

“Look, I’m a cancer survivor,” said Fiorina, who was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2009. “I understand you can’t have someone who’s battled cancer just become known as a preexisting condition. I understand that you cannot allow families to go bankrupt if they truly need help.”

She offered another way to run the health care system, saying that “the alternative is to allow states to manage high risk pools for those who really need help.”
