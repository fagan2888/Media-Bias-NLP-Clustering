Kennedy, chronicling his life, his leadership, and his tragic assassination. But amidst all the literary analysis Abramson lobs a few barbs in the direction of Bill O\u2019Reilly.\n\nAbramson cites the words of a historian journalist who believes that a lot of this JFK literary worship is done not simply to reflect on the life and times of America\u2019s 35th president, but to boost the celebrity profile of the author. And this is what brought Abramson around to O\u2019Reilly.\n\nAbramson contrasts O\u2019Reilly\u2019s book Killing Kennedy with the newer, written-for-children Kennedy\u2019s Last Days.\n\nThis new version, it must be said, distinctly improves on the original, whose choppy sentences, many written in the present tense, lose nothing when recast for younger readers. \u201cHe is on a collision course with evil,\u201d O\u2019Reilly declares. No less elevated is his discussion of Kennedy\u2019s decision to visit Dallas despite warnings of roiling violence, including the physical assault on his United Nations ambassador, Adlai Stevenson, who had given a speech in the city in October 1963. \u201cJ.F.K. has decided to visit Big D,\u201d O\u2019Reilly writes. \u201cThere is no backing down.\u201d\n\nAbramson does admit the \u201cwooden prose\u201d is slightly elevated by the illustrations, but dismissed it as the latest in a long line of \u201cbad books by celebrity authors.\u201d\n\nNoticeably absent from Abramson\u2019s review is any mention of another pundit with perhaps a far more intense fascination with Kennedy: Chris Matthews. Matthews has written two books, Kennedy & Nixon and Jack Kennedy: Elusive Hero, about Kennedy, and is himself pretty boastful about them.\n\nWould Matthews\u2019 JFK books be considered in the same vein as O\u2019Reilly\u2019s? I\u2019m guessing Matthews wouldn\u2019t take too kindly to that.\n\nYou can read the full review here.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In the New York Times Sunday Book Review this weekend, Times executive editor Jill Abramson looks at the staggering number of books about John F.
