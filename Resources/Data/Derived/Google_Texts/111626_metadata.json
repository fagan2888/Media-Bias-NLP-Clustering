(Trevor L. Davis / Loveland Reporter-Herald)\n\nMemorial Day commemorations on Monday \u2014 from somber to celebratory \u2014 honored the members of the military who never came home and gave thanks to those who did.\n\nAt the Associated Veterans of Loveland event at Loveland Burial Park, featured speaker Nick Pizzuti, a retired Army colonel who lives west of Berthoud, said the best way of thanking veterans today is by protecting and supporting them.\n\nPizzuti told the story of Alan, a young Army medic who was severely injured in Iraq in 2003 when he went to the aid of a fellow soldier and who is slowly working his way back from total paralysis.\n\n\"Alan would tell you he was just doing his job on the day he was wounded back in 2003,\" he said. \"He's no hero, he would say.\n\nJulianne Henry and her grandfather, Gene Stout, a Marine Corps veteran, salute the flag at the Associated Veterans of Loveland's Memorial Day ceremony in Loveland Burial Park on Monday. (Trevor L. Davis / Loveland Reporter-Herald)\n\n\"For that matter, I'm not sure I have ever heard a veteran or service member call him or herself a hero,\" Pizzuti said.\n\nHe stressed that this country can keep its promise to honor its warriors by \"providing reinforcement\" to wounded veterans such as Alan.\n\n\"We thank our veterans by fighting for them when they can't,\" Pizzuti said. \"By ensuring they and their survivors get the care they earned when they wrote a blank check \u2014 up to, and including, their very lives.\"\n\nThe Loveland Burial Park ceremony concluded with a roll call and tolling of a bell for the 24 local veterans who have died in the past year, a 21-gun salute and taps by bugler Terry Thompson.\n\nLoveland resident Mary Wheeler took her two young sons to the service, and they moved over at the end to get a better view of the Junior ROTC color guard taking down the flag.\n\nWheeler said her father served in Vietnam, her uncle in Vietnam and Korea and her great-uncle in World War II and Korea.\n\n\"I think it's important to teach the kids what Memorial Day's about; it's not about barbecues and shopping,\" she said. \"I want them to see the sacrifices people make for us.\"\n\nWendy Miller, a member of the honor choir at Frontier Academy in Greeley, releases a dove during the Memorial Day ceremony at Resthaven Memory Gardens on Monday.

Joseph Cassidy of Fort Collins delighted the crowd with stories from his first days in the Army after being drafted in 1943.\n\nThe 90-year-old served in the Army, then the Navy, during World War II and then returned to the Army for a total of 32 years in uniform.\n\nCassidy ran through a quick history of the wars that the United States has fought and the death toll of each, which have added up to 850,446 American men and women killed.\n\n\"The one word that describes war is 'ugly,' in all aspects\" he said. \"War is indeed an indictment of the human race.\n\n\"There is always the lingering doubt that another war could spring up, and there's always the lingering hope, the desire, the prayer that war will cease, and we will never have war again,\" Cassidy said.\n\nA helmet sits on a rifle during the Memorial Day ceremony at Loveland Burial Park on Monday. (Trevor L. Davis / Loveland Reporter-Herald)\n\n\"I have very often of late been approached by people who say, 'I want to thank you for your service,' and I, within myself, quietly, silently, I return that thanks to a country that is the greatest nation in the world, the United States of America.\"\n\nCassidy's speech was followed by a 21-gun salute, taps and the release of three dozen white doves.\n\nAnd then the party began. Kevin Wolfe, chief operating officer of Resthaven and Allnutt Funeral Services, said his study of history shows that cemeteries traditionally were places where families gathered for picnics and concerts, and he's trying to bring that back.\n\nResthaven had concerts, fireworks and a skydiving demonstration Friday and Saturday, and on Monday after the traditional ceremony, the Andrews Sisters tribute act Reveille 3 sang songs from the World War II era and other nostalgic favorites.\n\n\"It just makes you feel good to give back to the families we serve and give back to the veterans,\" Wolfe said. \"Today is to honor veterans.\"\n\nCraig Young: 970-635-3634, cyoung@reporter-herald.com, www.twitter.com/CraigYoungRH.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.reporterherald.com/news/loveland-local-news/ci_28186872/loveland-area-memorial-day-services-thank-war-heroes", "modificationDate": "2015-05-26T12:00:13-0600", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2015/0525/20150525__26RHAMEMORIALw~1_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By Craig Young \n \n  Reporter-Herald Staff Writer", "description": "Memorial Day commemorations on Monday \u2014 from somber to celebratory \u2014 honored the members of the military who never came  home and gave thanks to those who did.", "ag": {"canon": "LovelandReporter-Herald:article:28186872:view"}, "startDate": "2015-05-25T17:56:53-0600", "og": {"url": "http://www.reporterherald.com/news/loveland-local-news/ci_28186872/loveland-area-memorial-day-services-thank-war-heroes", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2015/0525/20150525__26RHAMEMORIALw~1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Memorial Day commemorations on Monday \u2014 from somber to celebratory \u2014 honored the members of the military who never came  home and gave thanks to those who did.", "title": "Loveland-area Memorial Day services thank war heroes living and dead"}, "twitter": {"domain": "reporterherald.com", "description": "Memorial Day commemorations on Monday \u2014 from somber to celebratory \u2014 honored the members of the military who never came  home and gave thanks to those who did.", "title": "Loveland-area Memorial Day services thank war heroes living and dead", "url": "http://www.reporterherald.com/news/loveland-local-news/ci_28186872/loveland-area-memorial-day-services-thank-war-heroes", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2015/0525/20150525__26RHAMEMORIALw~1.jpg", "site": "@reporterherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-05-25T17:56:53-0600", "sailthru.site": "reporterherald.com", "endDate": "2025-05-25T17:56:53-0600", "sailthru.title": "Loveland-area Memorial Day services thank war heroes living and dead", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Loveland News", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "XzsHDcJw4iXBQEYtDXFRaUAdKzxhSvxWMgXyQQNFFzg", "byline": "By Craig YoungReporter-Herald", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2015/0525/20150525__26RHAMEMORIALw~1.jpg", "pubDate": "2015-05-25T17:58:37-0600", "news_keywords": "Loveland News, Loveland News news, Loveland Colorado Loveland News news, Loveland Colorado news, Loveland News Loveland news, Loveland News Colorado news, US Loveland News news, world Loveland News news."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2b2c\"", "article_summary": "A helmet sits on a rifle during the Memorial Day ceremony at Loveland Burial Park on Monday.\nWendy Miller, a member of the honor choir at Frontier Academy in Greeley, releases a dove during the Memorial Day ceremony at Resthaven Memory Gardens on Monday.\nWheeler said her father served in Vietnam, her uncle in Vietnam and Korea and her great-uncle in World War II and Korea.\nJulianne Henry and her grandfather, Gene Stout, a Marine Corps veteran, salute the flag at the Associated Veterans of Loveland's Memorial Day ceremony in Loveland Burial Park on Monday.\nNiko Navas, a member of the Junior ROTC, cradles an American flag for a moment of silence after folding it at the end of the Associated Veterans' Memorial Day ceremony at Loveland Burial Park."}
