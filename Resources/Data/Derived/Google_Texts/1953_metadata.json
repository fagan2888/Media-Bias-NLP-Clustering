What needs to be understood are the triggering and venting mechanisms and how those factors play into today\u2019s politics.\n\nWe are told that the current rise of Donald Trump is the result of the classic: \u201cAngry White Male syndrome.\u201d\n\nBut that is individual anger. Mob or group anger is an entirely different matter. How one views the triggering or venting of anger is dependent upon the degree to which one either sympathizes with the causation or the plight of those angered.\n\nIn 2011 when the Occupy Wall Street crowds were rioting, defecating on police cars and attacking women, some \u201cprogressives\u201d \u2014 including Nancy Pelosi \u2014 found admiration in the protestors:\n\n\u201cGod bless them, for their spontaneity. It\u2019s independent ... it\u2019s young, it\u2019s spontaneous, and it\u2019s focused. And it\u2019s going to be effective,\u201d Pelosi reportedly said.\n\nRecently, the anger of American blacks has channeled into \u201cBlack Lives Matter.\u201d Lost, of course, is that the triggering mechanism, the death of Michael \u201cThe Gentle Giant\u201d Brown, is based on the proven falsehood of \u201cHands up, don\u2019t shoot.\u201d\n\nCompare these reactions to the response to the Tea Party. To the left, the controlled and appropriately channeled anger of this group is a source of ridicule, vexation and regarded as wholly unacceptable. It is not uncommon to see references to the Tea Party in harsh and militaristic terms. Case in point; the New York Times: \u201cThe stormy aftermath of Mississippi\u2019s Republican Senate runoff has sent Tea Party conservatives around the country to the ramparts, raising the prospect of a prolonged battle that holds the potential to depress conservative turnout in November in Mississippi \u2014 and possibly beyond.\u201d\n\nToday the anger of the electorate, including honest liberals (yes, a few actually exist) has manifested into the rise of non-establishment candidates.\n\nDonald Trump has channeled this anger into his (so far) successful run for the GOP nomination. The GOP establishment has failed to consider the advice of Confucius; \u201cWhen anger rises, think of the consequences.\u201d\n\nThus the well-justified anger has prevailed over the impotence of the \u201cNever Trump\u201d crowd.\n\nFollowing is a shortened list of contributory factors of the once simmering, now boiling, anger:\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2022 We thought that the Democrats supported African Americans and worked for their benefit, until we saw the \u201cHigh Tech lynching\u201d of Clarence Thomas.\n\n\u2022 We were told that the Clinton administration would be the most \u201cethical in history,\u201d but that was before: Travelgate, cattle futures, FBI filegate, bimbogate, Hillarycare, Whitewater, John Huang, Lincoln Bedroom, etc.\n\n\u2022 We were told Hillary was a champion of women\u2019s rights, but we then learned of: Eileen Wellstone, Juanita Broaddrick, Carolyn Moffet, Elizabeth Ward, Paula Corbin, Christy Zwercher, Kathleen Wiley, Paula Jones, etc.\n\n\u2022 We believed that it was illegal to raise money from the White House, then Vice President Gore taught us that there was \u201cNo controlling legal authority.\u201d\n\n\u2022 They said they wanted every vote to count. Why then did they conspire to throw out the military ballots?\n\n\u2022 We listened to President Bush\u2019s stirring speech on the USS Lincoln: \u201cOur mission continues. al-Qaida is wounded, not destroyed.\u201d This was turned into a source of ridicule as \u201cMission Accomplished\u201d was ensconced into the lexicon of the left.\n\n\u2022 We heard candidate Obama call his predecessor \u201cirresponsible and unpatriotic\u201d for increasing the national debt, but that was before President Obama added $8 trillion (and counting) to that debt.\n\n\u2022 Many believed candidate Obama when he told the Rev. Rick Warren that he believed marriage was between a man and a woman. Then we saw the White House bathed in celebratory rainbow colors.\n\n\u2022 The nation thought they elected a black president who would heal racial animus. Why were we then called racist for opposing his policies?\n\n\u2022 They told us that guns were a danger and automatic weapons were the ultimate evil. They said this as they supplied more than 2,000 guns to the Mexican drug cartels.\n\n\u2022 We heard Joe Wilson declare \u201cyou lie!\u201d to the president during his State of the Union address, and Wilson was severely rebuked in the media. Yet the words were more prescient than rude.\n\n\u2022 President Obama on national TV declared that Obamacare \u201cis absolutely not a tax increase.\u201d The Supreme Court\u2019s ruling indicated otherwise. We then saw the president celebrate his \u201cvictory.\u201d\n\n\u2022 John Gruber was caught on video discussing Obamacare: \u201cLack of transparency is a huge political advantage. And basically, call it the stupidity of the American voter ...\u201d And now everyone learned that was the plan all along: To deceive the \u201cstupid\u201d American voter.\n\n\u2022 We remember that Hillary wrote Article Two of the Nixon Impeachment, including: \u201cEndeavoured to obtain from the Internal Revenue Service ... confidential information contained in income tax returns.\u201d We then saw Lois Lerner plead the fifth to avoid prosecution for using the IRS for crass political gains.\n\n\u2022 We heard Hillary and others declare: \u201cIt was the video.\u201d When the truth was revealed, they blamed the Republicans for cutting their budget.\n\n\u2022 We heard the president declare that Iraq was a stable state, our soldiers had attained success. We then saw Christians crucified, burned alive, beheaded and otherwise killed by the \u201cJV\u201d team.\n\nGiven the above transgressions, one can respond in several ways: Those who support Hillary will challenge the facts as being incomplete or not telling the whole story. Taken collectively, they represent daunting evidence against Democrats in general and the Clintons in particular.\n\nIf one rationally considers the behavior above the choices are basic:\n\n\u2022 Acceptance. \u201cThere is nothing that can be done\u201d would be their unacceptable cry of defeat. In reality, does anyone wish to survive under a Vichy regime where those ostensibly in charge capitulate to controlling evil?\n\n\u2022 Resistance: Those actively supporting Trump or Sanders, have made this their choice. They wish to fight against the corruption of the establishment, while simultaneously rejecting the quislings.\n\nThose tottering between Hillary and Trump have a decision to make: The devil you know or the one you don\u2019t. Do you prostrate before the altar of the never changing government power structure, or do you risk the unknown?\n\nThe only recourse allowed for abuse by the Chief Executive is impeachment, which is not, nor never has been, a true \u201clegal\u201d process. Instead, impeachment is the ultimate end game of presidential politics. Nixon was impeachable, not as much for his \u201ccrimes,\u201d but because of the abject hate the left had for him.\n\nWe all acknowledge that the current president is unimpeachable. We must also recognize that Hillary would have a similar immunity, if elected.\n\nIt is difficult to imagine what we would endure under a President Rodham Clinton, one confident enough to believe she can get away with anything. Considering her history, who would challenge that belief?\n\nAs for me, I am willing to risk the devil I don\u2019t know rather than the one we have seen for far too many years.\n\n\u2014 Dennis Lund/Benicia", "article_metadata": {"description": "Human nature tells us that everyone experiences anger, to some degree or level.
