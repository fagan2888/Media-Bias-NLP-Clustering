(AP) - It\u2019s 2 in the afternoon and Bella is waiting.\n\nAt the same time each weekday afternoon - when she hears the click of a cane - Bella heads to the edge of the carpet, the dividing line that separates Dunklau Gardens from Fremont Health Medical Center.\n\nThat\u2019s where Bella waits for Roger Randall and a massage, the Fremont Tribune (http://bit.ly/1PwYbTt ) reported.\n\nSitting in a cushiony chair, Randall massages the Labrador retriever\u2019s neck and back. And before long, the yellow dog has melted into a furry heap on the tile floor.\n\nIt\u2019s a unique partnership, but one that\u2019s mutually beneficial.\n\nBella was a rescued stray, who\u2019s become a friend to residents and staff at the hospital and care center.\n\nRandall is a Fremont man, who had to relearn basic tasks like walking and using his left and right hands after strokes damaged his brain nearly seven years ago.\n\nTogether, they attract smiles and friendly comments from passersby.\n\nBella was just a year old when she was found by a Humane Society worker in another town. A family adopted Bella and had her for a year when they realized a daughter was allergic to the dog.\n\nCindy Cook Bouslaugh, resident life associate at Dunklau Gardens, was looking for a dog when she saw a listing about Bella on the Internet and contacted her owners.\n\n\u201cWe met in North Bend and they let me have her for a day to see if she worked with our family and she worked out perfectly,\u201d Cook Bouslaugh said. \u201cWe called them that afternoon and told them we\u2019d take her.\u201d\n\nBella has found her canine calling at Dunklau Gardens.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s been coming to work every (week)day for the last two years and she has just been perfect,\u201d Cook Bouslaugh said.\n\nThe dog happily enters - with her tail wagging - a group of wiggly, loud preschoolers and is equally at home with the residents.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s just the right height for the wheelchairs and when we go into new people\u2019s rooms, she breaks the ice - whether they\u2019re scared or confused or even if they have dementia, she puts a smile on everyone\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cShe doesn\u2019t judge,\u201d Cook Bouslaugh said. \u201cShe just brings love to everyone.\u201d\n\nBella also knows a friend, like Randall, when she finds one.\n\nRandall was 58 when he had a series of strokes that affected both sides of his brain.\n\n\u201cI had to learn how to do everything again,\u201d he said.\n\nThat meant simple things like learning how to brush his teeth.\n\nAnd it meant relearning how to walk, a road he\u2019d traveled years earlier.\n\n\u201cWhen I was about 21, I had both feet broken and had to learn how to walk again,\u201d he said.\n\nThe prospects could have been extremely discouraging, but Randall realized something.\n\nDuring rehab at Omaha\u2019s Immanuel Hospital, Randall said he saw soldiers returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. He cites the case of a 28-year-old soldier and father of three who was a quadriplegic.\n\nRandall realized he\u2019d already lived much of his life and had been able to do much of what he\u2019d wanted to do, while the young father had many years of life ahead.\n\n\u201cYou look around. There are so many that are so much worse off - and I\u2019ve got so much to work with - you don\u2019t want to lie there and feel sorry for yourself,\u201d he said. \u201cSo you just keep driving ahead.\u201d\n\nAfter about three months, Randall could walk, although it tired him.\n\nDoctors wanted to make sure he could walk and navigate stairs before he came home.\n\nRandall said he returned home and went to rehabilitation at Fremont Health.\n\nAfter that, he started working out in the hospital\u2019s Wellness Center, operated by the Fremont Family YMCA.\n\nAt the Wellness Center, he works with the ActivTrax weights and cardio program.\n\nRandall figures he\u2019s gone 3,000 or more miles on the elliptical and lifted thousands of pounds of weight.\n\n\u201cI could have walked to Denver and back on the elliptical,\u201d he said. \u201cIt helps my gait and my feet.\u201d\n\nRandall also walks a circular, indoor route that takes him along hallways at Fremont Health and Dunklau Gardens, which are connected.\n\nAlthough his eyesight was fine when he walked outside, Randall noticed that while walking and looking down the hallways, it seemed like the walls would close in about 20 to 30 feet ahead.\n\nSo instead of walking on a treadmill in the Wellness Center, he began walking the corridors to help improve his eyesight.\n\nAbout a year ago, he discovered an unexpected ally.\n\n\u201cI was walking one day and Bella was out here and so I stopped and petted her,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter his stroke, Randall lacked the coordination to smoothly pet an animal or hold a small child.\n\nEven picking up inanimate objects was tough. He couldn\u2019t control the strength in his hands.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d pick up a pen or a pencil and snap it,\u201d he said.\n\nHe worked with a ball in the palm of his hands until he could rotate it forward, backward and around.\n\nRandall also began using both hands to give Bella shoulder rubs to help with his right and left hand coordination.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d work her neck and around her ears, give her a massage,\u201d he said.\n\nBella liked the relaxing massages.\n\n\u201cIt got so that she just melted to the floor and collapsed upside down,\u201d Randall said, smiling.\n\nEventually, Randall was able to pet Shredder, a miniature Australian shepherd.\n\n\u201cI pet him and I\u2019m real careful,\u201d he said. \u201cI work very carefully and scratch his ears. He\u2019s more fragile.\u201d\n\nHe doesn\u2019t try to hold cats.\n\n\u201cIf I try to hold them, I clamp down or squeeze too hard and a cat doesn\u2019t like that,\u201d he said.\n\nBut if a cat lies on its side, he will pet it.\n\nAnd he pets Bella who waits for Randall each weekday.\n\nOne day, Bella wasn\u2019t outside waiting for Randall and he figured she wasn\u2019t around.\n\nSo he proceeded down the corridor.\n\nThat\u2019s when the dog took matters into her own paws and went looking for Randall.\n\n\u201cPretty soon you had this feeling that something was watching you and I stopped at the corner and turned around - and here Bella rounded the corner,\u201d he said.\n\nNot one to miss a good massage, Bella was headed his way.\n\n\u201cWe came back to the chair and I gave her a neck rub and talked to her and she gets all happy,\u201d he said.\n\nRandall estimates that he rubs Bella\u2019s neck for no longer than 15 minutes to a half hour.\n\nHe appreciates Bella.\n\n\u201cShe got my hands working . I can coordinate my right and left hands now . and she\u2019s so friendly,\u201d he said.\n\nCook Bouslaugh also appreciates Bella, who goes camping and swimming with her family.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s really been a blessing to my husband, Joe, and I,\u201d she said. \u201cShe\u2019s been so good.\u201d\n\nAnd as she waits each day at 2 for Randall, it\u2019s apparent that she\u2019s a blessing to him, too.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Fremont Tribune, http://www.fremontneb.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "It's 2 in the afternoon and Bella is waiting.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "It\u2019s 2 in the afternoon and Bella is waiting.", "title": "Dog gets massages as Fremont man regains hand coordination", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/sep/26/dog-gets-massages-as-fremont-man-regains-hand-coor/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/26/776487c624d1082b830f6a7067005f30.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/26/776487c624d1082b830f6a7067005f30.jpg", "description": "It's 2 in the afternoon and Bella is waiting.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Dog gets massages as Fremont man regains hand coordination"}, "Author": "TAMMY REAL-MCKEIGHAN", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2934\"", "article_summary": "Randall also began using both hands to give Bella shoulder rubs to help with his right and left hand coordination.\nRandall is a Fremont man, who had to relearn basic tasks like walking and using his left and right hands after strokes damaged his brain nearly seven years ago.\nA family adopted Bella and had her for a year when they realized a daughter was allergic to the dog.\nThat\u2019s where Bella waits for Roger Randall and a massage, the Fremont Tribune (http://bit.ly/1PwYbTt ) reported.\nBella was a rescued stray, who\u2019s become a friend to residents and staff at the hospital and care center."}
