And it appears the Kentucky Republican, who was elected Senate majority leader Thursday for the new Congress, plans to join the president for a glass of bourbon, according to the Associated Press.\n\nA day after Republicans handed Democrats an Election Day defeat by taking control of the Senate, Obama extended an olive branch during a White House press conference. \u201cYou know, actually, I would enjoy having some Kentucky bourbon with Mitch McConnell,\u201d Obama told reporters. The president hasn\u2019t always felt that way. At the 2013 White House Correspondents Dinner, Obama responded to criticism that he hadn\u2019t put in enough face time with Republicans in Congress. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you get a drink with Mitch McConnell,\u201d Obama joked, adding, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I get frustrated sometimes.\u201d\n\nRepublicans, too, are sounding a bipartisan note in the wake of the midterm elections. But McConnell told GOP leaders Saturday in Kentucky that the premise of the so-called \u201cbourbon summit\u201d remains to be seen, according to the AP.\n\nMeeting over drinks is not without precedent in the Obama White House. In 2009, Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. and police Sgt. James Crowley, the Cambridge officer who arrested Gates at his Cambridge, Mass. home, sat down with the president on the Rose Garden patio for a \u201cbeer summit.\u201d Gates consumed a Red Stripe, Obama a Bud Light and Crowley a Blue Moon.\n\nIt remains to be seen which Kentucky bourbon Obama and the top Republican in the Senate will go for.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "It appears the so-called \"bourbon summit\" between President Obama and Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell is indeed in the works.", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/bourbon-summit-mitch-mcconnell", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "It appears the so-called \"bourbon summit\" between President Obama and Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell is indeed in the works.", "title": "'Bourbon summit' is on, says Mitch McConnell", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/bourbon-summit-mitch-mcconnell", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/ap672235422061.jpg?itok=huAvAXHb", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/bourbon-summit-mitch-mcconnell", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/ap672235422061.jpg?itok=fYQ5a7lx", "title": "'Bourbon summit' is on, says Mitch McConnell", "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "It appears the so-called \"bourbon summit\" between President Obama and Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell is indeed in the works."}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2014-11-15T16:56:00-05:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "nv": {"author": "drewkat", "title": "'Bourbon summit' is on, says Mitch McConnell", "tags": "barack-obama,democrats,mitch-mcconnell,republicans", "published": 1, "date": "11/15/2014 16:56:00 EST", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/bourbon-summit-mitch-mcconnell"}, "article": {"author": "http://www.facebook.com/msnbc"}, "abstract": "It appears the so-called \"bourbon summit\" between President Obama and Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell is indeed in the works.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Democrats, Republicans, Barack Obama, Mitch McConnell"}, "article_summary": "\u201cYou know, actually, I would enjoy having some Kentucky bourbon with Mitch McConnell,\u201d Obama told reporters.\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you get a drink with Mitch McConnell,\u201d Obama joked, adding, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\nPresident Obama has come around on the prospect of having a drink with Mitch McConnell.\nIt remains to be seen which Kentucky bourbon Obama and the top Republican in the Senate will go for.\nBut McConnell told GOP leaders Saturday in Kentucky that the premise of the so-called \u201cbourbon summit\u201d remains to be seen, according to the AP."}
