The Pentagon \u201cand State [Department] give information to SIGAR every quarter on their successes such as drug-treatment centers built, rehab workers trained, tractors donated (31 last year), alternative-livelihood programs executed, drug seizures, and so on. Yet, despite all this, we see record and rising levels of opium production.\u201d\n\nDespite these taxpayer-funded efforts, \u201cThe United Nations reports that Afghanistan produces 90 percent of the world\u2019s illicit opiates,\u201d Sopko said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s equivalent to more than 400,000 U.S. football fields, including the end zones,\u201d he added. \u201cThis enormous acreage devoted to opium feeds a huge tragedy-fostering heroin addiction and crime around the world, including here-as well as a strategic threat. Taxes on opium are a major revenue source for Afghan insurgents, and a powerful prod to corruption among Afghan officials.\u201d\n\nThe billions the United States spends on counter-narcotics programs reduced Afghanistan\u2019s opium fields by just more than 1 percent in the last year.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line\u2014record opium cultivation and production\u2014clearly shows we are not winning the war on drugs in Afghanistan,\u201d Sopko said.\n\nSince 2002, Congress has appropriated nearly $110 billion for various Afghanistan reconstruction projects. The money continues to flow despite many instances of fraud and waste identified by SIGAR in recent years.\n\nSecurity in Afghanistan also continues to deteriorate, making it more difficult for inspectors to provide oversight on the projects receiving U.S. funding.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "Afghanistan is housing the equivalent of 400,000 football fields worth of opium fields, despite the United States having spent billions in taxpayer funds to combat the growth of illicit narcotics, acc", "title": "Afghanistan Housing 400,000 Football Fields Worth of Opium", "url": "http://freebeacon.com/national-security/afghanistan-housing-400000-football-fields-worth-of-opium/", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/poppy-field-Afghanistan-150x150.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Afghanistan is housing the equivalent of 400,000 football fields worth of opium fields, despite the", "creator": "@Kredo0", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/poppy-field-Afghanistan-150x150.jpg", "title": "Afghanistan Housing 400,000 Football Fields Worth of Opium", "site": "@freebeacon", "card": "summary"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1047859882", "fb": {"app_id": "FB_APP_ID", "pages": 282024895179874}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "BY: Follow @Kredo0Afghanistan is housing the equivalent of 400,000 football fields worth of opium fields, despite the United States having spent billions in taxpayer funds to combat the growth of illicit narcotics, according to the Special Inspector General for Afghan Reconstruction (SIGAR).\n\u201cThe bottom line\u2014record opium cultivation and production\u2014clearly shows we are not winning the war on drugs in Afghanistan,\u201d Sopko said.\n\u201cAs of this March, the United States has provided $8.4 billion-I repeat, billion-for counternarcotics programs in Afghanistan,\u201d Sopko said, according to text of his remarks.\n\u201cThat\u2019s equivalent to more than 400,000 U.S. football fields, including the end zones,\u201d he added.\nSecurity in Afghanistan also continues to deteriorate, making it more difficult for inspectors to provide oversight on the projects receiving U.S. funding."}
