And that goes for next weekend's special rail tickets as well.\n\nThe ticket scam most often involves websites that are designed to skim credit card information or request wire transfers to pay for tickets and rail passes. Some of the 30,000 free tickets that were offered online to see the pope at Independence Hall, the World Meeting of Families closing ceremonies and the papal Mass were selling at online sites like Craigslist and eBay for hundreds of dollars just a few hours after the reservations closed.\n\nAs the historic visit draws near, Pennsylvania and New Jersey consumer advocates and law enforcement authorities have been watching and waiting for word about pope-related fraud schemes.\n\n\"Our agents are keeping an eye out for anything that could be suspicious,\" Sadie Martin, a spokeswoman with the Pennsylvania Attorney General's Bureau of Consumer Protection, said.\n\nAs of last week, Burlington County Sheriff Jean Stanfield said her office hadn't received any reports of suspected fraud related to the papal visit, but her staff is keeping an eye out and will forward any complaints to the New Jersey Department of Consumer Affairs.\n\nStanfield believes most fraud will involve fake tickets for papal events or online scams for phony accommodations.\n\n\u201cHopefully, people are being savvy,\u201d she added.\n\nEvents like the papal visit are often rife with scammers, Bucks County Director of Consumer Protection Michael Bannon said.\n\n\u201cHistory has it, at large events like this, the scam artist, thieves and con artists all thrive and try their best to trick unsuspecting consumers out of money or other valuable items,\u201d Bannon said. \u201cWhen someone is asked to open their wallet or purse for money to buy something, take a second to stop and think about it.\u201d\n\nHigh-pressure sales are a red flag that something might be off, the Bucks official said, adding that his office will monitor its phone lines during the weekend papal visit, Bannon added.\n\nOther anticipated scams involve housing and parking.\n\nHousing scams typically target outsiders who put down deposits on rental homes that are advertised online. When they arrive, they learn the house or apartment doesn\u2019t exist or it was never available for rent \u2014 leaving out-of-town visitors without accommodations.\n\nWith parking at a premium in Philadelphia and the suburban neighborhoods near the rail stations that will be open next weekend, Bannon said he anticipates some people may set up paid parking in lots they don\u2019t have authorization to use. Such scams could cost drivers much more than the parking fee if the lot owners have vehicles towed, Bannon said.\n\nMontgomery County Sheriff Russell Bono said his department isn\u2019t aware of any local scams related to the papal visit, but he\u2019s heard of a phone scam offering front row tickets to the Sunday Mass on the Benjamin Franklin Parkway. Tickets are free \u2014 and they've already been distributed.\n\nOlder adults are expected to account for the majority of those attending events related to the pope\u2019s visit and that is the population that organized scam artists most frequently target, authorities said.\n\nBono warned against providing any financial information to callers \u2014 even if the callers appear to have accurate information about the person or their plans to see the pope. Fraudsters also will also disguise caller ID \u2014 a scam called spoofing \u2014 to make it appear a legitimate organization or business is calling, Bono said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very easy for them to get that information from multiple sources,\u201d Bono said.\n\nBefore giving out any financial information, individuals should verify what a caller says with the business, church or other organization the caller mentions.\n\nSEPTA initially used a lottery system for chances to buy its special Regional Rail passes for the pope\u2019s visit, but Bannon said concern remains that scammers \u2014 using high-tech printing equipment \u2014 may attempt to duplicate the passes, which sold for $10 for each day. SEPTA isn't aware of any attempts involving fraudulent papal rail passes, spokesman Andrew Busch said. The passes do have security features, including magnetic encoding, visual reflective foil applique or a hologram, he added.\n\nA check of Craigsist and eBay found ads selling SEPTA rail passes for the pope weekend for prices ranging from $20 to $70 per pass, per day. One seller offered 20 passes for $1,000. After SEPTA had leftover passes following its lottery, the agency switched to in-person pass sales and has encouraged people to purchase tickets directly at rail stations.\n\nAnother ticket scam Bannon and others anticipate involves people offering special passes to meet Pope Francis. Those passes don't exist, though many area parishes were given free tickets that would allow them to get closer to the pope.\n\n\u201cThe World Meeting of Families Philadelphia 2015 will be aggressively monitoring for counterfeit/black market 'tickets,' \" Archdiocese of Philadelphia spokesman Kenneth Gavin said.\n\nOther scams consumer advocates anticipate involve souvenirs allegedly blessed or touched by the pope and price gouging for water and food.\n\nUpdated information on the World Meeting and papal events can be found at www.worldmeeting2015.org or the website of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops at www.usccb.org/about/leadership/holy-see/francis/papal-visit-2015/index.cfm.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Bucks County Courier Times", "description": "Pennsylvania consumer advocates are watching for similar scammers.
