About 44 percent of Heritage Action\u2019s overall contributions came from individuals or entities giving less than $5,000. The names of those donors aren\u2019t publicly available, since 501(c)(4)s don\u2019t have to disclose them. But the size and number of the gifts lends support to group\u2019s claim to have grassroots support, at least last year. Of the 108 itemized contributions of more than $5,000 listed in the group\u2019s annual Form 990 filing, 63 were donations of $10,000 or less. The largest gift was $500,000. That likely was a grant from billionaire industrialists Charles and David Koch, made through a nonprofit trade association linked to them called Freedom Partners. Heritage and the Shutdown When Heritage Action was founded in 2010, Edwin Feulner and Michael Needham \u2014 the heads of both the Heritage Foundation, which dates back to the Nixon administration, and its new political arm, respectively \u2014 wrote in the Wall Street Journal that the older group had been referred to as \u201cthe beast\u201d of all think tanks. Now, with the birth of Heritage Action, \u201cour beast added new fangs,\u201d they wrote.\n\nIn the same article, Feulner and Needham attested that Heritage Action \u201cwill not get involved in electoral politics.\u201d Two years after its founding, though, in 2012, Heritage Action spent more than $200,000 on expenditures directly advocating for or against a dozen candidates.\n\nBut Heritage Action\u2019s electoral activities were dwarfed by the political pressure it exerted before and during the recent shutdown. Heritage Action spent much of the last three months promoting a plan to defund Obamacare.\n\nSenator Ted Cruz (R-Texas) \u2014 who would become the face of the shutdown battle \u2014 went on a nine-city tour \u201cDefund Obamacare Town Hall Tour\u201d hosted by Heritage Action in August. Cruz was joined by former senator and current Heritage Foundation President Jim DeMint who called on Republicans to defund the healthcare law in the upcoming budget battles or risk being \u201c replaced .\u201d\n\nHeritage Action\u2019s strategy involved networks of \u201c Sentinels \u201d around the country who received information and talking points from Heritage and were encouraged to use it in letters to the editor or community meetings. Thousands of prospective Sentinels attended Heritage Action\u2019s \u201c skills clinics \u201d in the months before the shutdown. The aim of the program was to \u201cenvelop\u201d Congress in the Heritage message, Heritage Action CEO Needham told Rolling Stone . Thus a lawmaker would be \u201chearing it from our six lobbyists\u201d while Congress was in session and from \u201ca well-informed Sentinel who is a Tea Party leader\u201d while back in his or her district.\n\nEven as the shutdown stretched into its third week and the public had long soured on the gridlock in the Capitol, Heritage Action was unshakable. Needham praised the House for \u201cpushing to defund this unworkable, unaffordable and unfair law\u201d and lamented that Senate Republicans didn\u2019t have the \u201cdetermination\u201d of their colleagues in the House.\n\nAt the same time, as House GOP lawmakers tried to craft a last-ditch bill to reopen the government and raise the debt ceiling, Heritage Action asserted that a \u201cyes\u201d vote for any bill that didn\u2019t defund Obamacare would be \u201c key voted ,\u201d negatively affecting members\u2019 scores on the group\u2019s scorecards\n\nA Bigger Base Than Many\n\n\n\nThe attention that Heritage Action got during the shutdown often touched on the group\u2019s possible donors. But \u2014 if the group\u2019s pattern in 2012 has continued in 2013 \u2014 it has a large donor base compared to other notable nonprofits active in politics. For example, American Action Network \u2018s latest 990, filed last May, showed the group raising far more money from just 45 donors. AAN\u2019s largest donation, $10.3 million, was nearly twice as much as Heritage Action\u2019s entire 2012 revenues.\n\nOpenSecrets Blog, these donors gave between $1 million and $5 million each. Together, contributions of $5,000 or more made up more than 75 percent of the FreedomWork\u2019s total revenues in 2012. FreedomWorks , the other prominent social welfare organization leading the charge to defund Obamacare , received nearly 60 percent of its $15 million in revenues from just four donors in 2012. According to a recent filing also obtained by thethese donors gave between $1 million and $5 million each. Together, contributions of $5,000 or more made up more than 75 percent of the FreedomWork\u2019s total revenues in 2012.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "OpenSecrets Blog", "description": "Heritage Action, one of the biggest advocates of defunding Obamacare even if it meant a government shutdown, raised close to half of its 2012 revenue from donors giving less than $5,000.", "title": "More than Kochs, Small Donors Fueled Heritage Action in 2012", "locale": "en_US", "updated_time": "2013-10-24T16:16:56+00:00", "url": "http://www.opensecrets.org/news/2013/10/more-than-kochs-small-donors-fueled/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2013-10-24T16:16:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-10-24T16:16:56+00:00"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc93a2\"", "article_summary": "The aim of the program was to \u201cenvelop\u201d Congress in the Heritage message, Heritage Action CEO Needham told Rolling Stone .\nNow, with the birth of Heritage Action, \u201cour beast added new fangs,\u201d they wrote.\nIn the same article, Feulner and Needham attested that Heritage Action \u201cwill not get involved in electoral politics.\u201d Two years after its founding, though, in 2012, Heritage Action spent more than $200,000 on expenditures directly advocating for or against a dozen candidates.\nAbout 44 percent of Heritage Action\u2019s overall contributions came from individuals or entities giving less than $5,000.\nHeritage Action spent much of the last three months promoting a plan to defund Obamacare."}
