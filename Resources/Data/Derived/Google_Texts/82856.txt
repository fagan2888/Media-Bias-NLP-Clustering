John Dickerson of Slate recently reported on a woman from Pennsylvania who has (unsuccessfully) attempted to sign up for coverage under the Affordable Care Act.

After logging on when the exchanges began at 8 a.m. on October 1, she immediately ran into problems. The site failed to record her information correctly and she could not alter the incorrect information it’d recorded, so “Alice” went to the website’s customer-service online chat. Here’s what happened:

Thanks for your interest in the Health Insurance Marketplace. We have a lot of visitors trying to use our website right now. That is causing some glitches for some people trying to create accounts or log in. Keep trying, and thanks for your patience. We’ll continue working to improve the site so you can get covered

[4:32:40 pm]: Alice

what does that mean?

[4:32:52 pm]: Alice

It says my application is “in Progress”

[4:33:12 pm]: Alice

Does that mean it is not completed and I can continue to try to edit it?

[4:33:55 pm]: Alice
