Construction M&A Continues to Build Up With Morsco Buying Murray Supply

The purchase will expand the Advent-backed buyers presence in the Southeast

Heating and cooling equipment supplier Morsco, backed by Advent International, has acquired privately held plumbing supplier Murray Supply Co., as strong dealmaking momentum in the construction industry continues.

Murray Supply, founded in 1965 and with headquarters in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, distributes residential and commercial plumbing products. It has operations in North Carolina and Virginia. The purchase is Morsco’s first in the Southeast and will give the buyer a total of seven operating businesses.

Advent acquired Morsco in 2011 when it was known as Morris Supply Co. In 2013, Forth Worth Texas-based Morsco acquired Express Pipe & Supply.

Construction deals have been picking up in 2015. For instance, High Road Capital Partners has purchased Cali Bamboo LLC; Masonite International Corp. (NYSE: DOOR) made a $82 million deal for National Hickman.; Quanex (NYSE: NX) announced its intent to buy privately-held cabinets manufacturer Woodcraft Industries for $248.5 million in cash.

The Orr Group advised Murray Supply.
