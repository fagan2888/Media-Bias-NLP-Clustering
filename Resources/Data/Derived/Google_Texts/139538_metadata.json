The law abolished the \u201cpersonal belief exemption\u201d which allowed parents to refuse to vaccinate their children \u2014 but still send them to public or private school.\n\n\u201cThe law doesn\u2019t say (special education students) are exempt,\u201d said Ronald Wenkart, general counsel for the Orange County Department of Education and the author of the memo. If the lawmakers who drafted the legislation had wanted to exempt these students, \u201cthey could have put an exemption in there,\u201d he said.\n\nYet, many parents who opposed the new vaccination law, known as Senate Bill 277, believed that special education students would be exempt. That\u2019s because of language in the bill, inserted late in the legislative process, that they felt guaranteed federally-protected educational services no matter what. The law states that it \u201cdoes not prohibit\u201d a student who qualifies for a special education from \u201caccessing any special education and related services.\u201d No details are provided.\n\nBut the meaning of the phrase \u201caccessing any special education and related services\u201d has not yet been clarified by the California Department of Public Health, which is charged with issuing regulations and guidance to schools about the vaccination law. The Orange County Office of Education appears to be one of the first education agencies to offer an interpretation.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of anxiety, a lot of frustration and the feeling that we were lied to.\u201d Kristie Sepulveda-Burchit, executive director, Educate Advocate\n\nIts memo has surprised and upset some parents of unvaccinated students in special education, said Kristie Sepulveda-Burchit, executive director of Educate Advocate, a Southern California-based nonprofit organization of parents of children with special needs.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of anxiety, a lot of frustration and the feeling that we were lied to,\u201d Sepulveda-Burchit said. \u201cPretty much anyone you talk to was under the impression that students with an IEP (Individualized Education Program) were exempt from the bill.\u201d\n\nBut that is not how the Orange County Department of Education sees it.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there is any difference between general education and special education in terms of vaccinations,\u201d Wenkart said. \u201cIt\u2019s the same rules.\u201d\n\nHe said the federal guarantee of a \u201cfree and appropriate education\u201d for students with disabilities does not conflict with the state law requiring that students be vaccinated.\n\n\u201cA child is entitled to a free and appropriate education and you also have a legal obligation to vaccinate your child,\u201d he said. Wenkart did not provide further explanation about how schools would provide special education services to unvaccinated students.\n\nHe added, \u201cIf a parent chooses to violate the law, consequences could follow.\u201d After notifying parents in writing about the requirements of Senate Bill 277, school districts could contact the Orange County Health Care Agency for assistance, he said.\n\nAnd parents could end up in court, he said. \u201cThey\u2019d have to present what would be their reason for not vaccinating their child,\u201d Wenkart said. \u201cIf they believe vaccinations are harmful, the burden of proof is on them and they\u2019d have to provide medical backup.\u201d A school district could seek a court order to force parents to comply with the law, he said.\n\nThe legal opinion of the Orange County Department of Education is not the final word. The California Department of Public Health said that with regard to special education students, it \u201cis reviewing the new law and meeting with partners to determine what guidance might be needed.\u201d\n\nJennifer Nix, an attorney with School and College Legal Services of California, noted that the federal law is clear in requiring that students who qualify for special education receive those services.\n\n\u201cFederal law always trumps state law, if they can\u2019t be implemented at the same time,\u201d Nix said.\n\nPaul Lavigne, executive director of the Greater Anaheim Special Education Local Plan Area, said his organization is waiting for further guidance. \u201cIt\u2019s one of these situations where the interpretation of the law is going to be the issue,\u201d he said.\n\nAt the board meeting scheduled for Monday at the Orange County Department of Education in Costa Mesa, Sepulveda-Burchit and other members of Educate Advocate are \u201choping to get some more answers,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThis brings fear to a whole other level for parents of kids with special needs,\u201d she said of the memo.\n\nJane Meredith Adams covers student health and well-being for EdSource.
