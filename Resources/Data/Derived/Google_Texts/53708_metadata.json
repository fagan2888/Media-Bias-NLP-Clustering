The ad also talks about Weh\u2019s support of a \u201cflat tax\u201d which proponents say would be more fair while allowing everyone to contribute and critics say would slash taxes on the wealthiest Americans while increasing taxes on Americans with less money.\n\nWhen it comes to the Affordable Care Act, Udall\u2019s ad says repealing the law would result in nearly 190,000 New Mexicans losing their health insurance.\n\n\u201cAs a multi-millionaire CEO, Allen Weh seems to be looking out for himself and CEOs like him instead of New Mexico families. Otherwise he would know that his Tea Party strategy of revoke and deny would be disastrous for New Mexico,\u201d Udall campaign manager Daniel Sena said in a statement. \u201cAllen Weh is just wrong for New Mexico. According to Weh\u2019s own ad, he wants to turn back the clock to a time when insurance companies could kick you off your health insurance plan if you got sick \u2013 when being a woman was considered a pre-existing condition. He even supports a plan that would cut Medicare and Social Security so millionaires like him could pay less in taxes.\u201d\n\nTom Udall: I\u2019m Tom Udall, and I approved this message. Voice Over: 190,000 New Mexicans would lose their health insurance. That\u2019s what Allen Weh is calling for. And if you have a pre-existing condition, insurance companies could drop you again. Allen Weh also supports a plan that cuts Medicare and Social Security to pay for tax breaks for CEOs and millionaires like himself. Allen Weh would destroy Social Security and Medicare \u2026 for a tax break? Allen Weh: Way wrong.\u201d\n\nTranscript as provided by Udall\u2019s campaign:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "New Mexico Telegram", "description": "Just yesterday, NM Telegram wrote that Udall kept his string of positive ads going.
