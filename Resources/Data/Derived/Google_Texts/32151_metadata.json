Ad Policy\n\nAn ever-present force in this debate was a group called Concerned Veterans for America. Its leader, Peter Hegseth, frequently appeared on cable news segments about the scandal, and CVA was often mentioned on the floor of the Senate.\n\nThough the group doesn\u2019t disclose its donors, it has for a long while been clear the group is funded in part, or perhaps even in full, by the Koch brothers. Any remaining doubt can now be erased thanks to audio from the secretive Koch donor retreat this summer, obtained by The Undercurrent and reported here.\n\nHegseth addressed the crowd and not only confirmed that the Koch network \u201cliterally created\u201d CVA but explained giddily \u201cthe central role that Concerned Veterans for America played in exposing and driving this crisis from the very beginning.\u201d\n\nMost notably, during his roughly ten-minute speech, Hegseth outlined how the group was turning legitimate grievances over Veterans Affairs care into a political weapon to attack both the Obama administration and the idea of government-provided healthcare.\n\nWhen Kevin Gentry, vice president of the Charles G. Koch charitable foundation, introduced Hegseth to the assembled donors, he noted that \u201cyou all helped build a group called Concerned Veterans for America.\u201d\n\nAt various points, Hegseth took pains to express his gratitude to the people funding his operation. \u201cConcerned Veterans for America is an organization this network literally created to empower veterans and military families to fight for the freedom and prosperity here at home that we fought for in uniform on the battlefield,\u201d he noted.\n\n\u201cWe utilized the competitive advantage that only this network provides: the long-term vision to invest and the resources to back it up,\u201d he continued.\n\nHegseth also created a distinct impression for the audience that CVA was responsible for bringing the VA crisis to the forefront:", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/pete_hegseth_ap_img-275x173.jpg", "sailthru.author": "George Zornick", "description": "From the beginning, the Koch Brothers were exploiting troubles at VA hospitals to weaken Obamacare and attack Democrats.", "generator": "WooCommerce 2.3.13", "og": {"site_name": "The Nation", "description": "From the beginning, the Koch Brothers were exploiting troubles at VA hospitals to weaken Obamacare and attack Democrats.", "title": "How the Koch Network Exploited the Veterans Affairs Crisis", "url": "http://www.thenation.com/article/how-koch-network-exploited-veterans-affairs-crisis/", "image": {"width": 1500, "identifier": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/pete_hegseth_ap_img.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 975}, "updated_time": "2015-06-29T08:27:37+00:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "From the beginning, the Koch Brothers were exploiting troubles at VA hospitals to weaken Obamacare and attack Democrats.", "title": "How the Koch Network Exploited the Veterans Affairs Crisis", "url": "http://www.thenation.com/article/how-koch-network-exploited-veterans-affairs-crisis/", "image": {"height": 975, "src": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/pete_hegseth_ap_img.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/pete_hegseth_ap_img-1440x756.jpg", "width": 1500}, "site": "@TheNation", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "September 23rd, 2014", "sailthru.title": "How the Koch Network Exploited the Veterans Affairs Crisis", "keywords": "George Zornick, The Nation, Pete Hegseth, Koch Brothers, Concerned Veterans for America, Healthcare, VA Crisis, Political Weapon,", "fb": {"app_id": 192399944158735}, "sailthru.content_id": 112803, "sailthru.tags": "Corporations,Politics,Science and Health,Blog", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheNationMagazine", "tag": "Political Weapon", "published_time": "2014-09-23T16:00:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-29T08:27:37+00:00", "author": "http://www.thenation.com/author/george-zornick/"}, "sailthru.description": "From the beginning, the Koch brothers were exploiting troubles at VA hospitals to weaken Obamacare and attack Democrats.", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/pete_hegseth_ap_img-680x430.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8f35\"", "article_summary": "Ad PolicyAn ever-present force in this debate was a group called Concerned Veterans for America.\nHegseth also created a distinct impression for the audience that CVA was responsible for bringing the VA crisis to the forefront:\n\u201cConcerned Veterans for America is an organization this network literally created to empower veterans and military families to fight for the freedom and prosperity here at home that we fought for in uniform on the battlefield,\u201d he noted.\nIts leader, Peter Hegseth, frequently appeared on cable news segments about the scandal, and CVA was often mentioned on the floor of the Senate.\n\u201cWe utilized the competitive advantage that only this network provides: the long-term vision to invest and the resources to back it up,\u201d he continued."}
