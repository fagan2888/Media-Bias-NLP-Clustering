The agency, part of the Department of Health and Human Services, oversees Obamacare and the associated website HealthCare.gov.\n\nOne of the main questions the GAO and lawmakers had for CMS was whether HealthCare.gov would be ready for consumers for the second open enrollment period, which begins in November and ends in February. During that time, consumers will be able to purchase health insurance through the federal exchange for coverage beginning next year.\n\nThe GAO report calls on CMS to analyze potential risks before new signups begin:\n\nCMS needs a mitigation plan to address these issues. Unless CMS improves contract management and adheres to a structured governance process, significant risks remain that upcoming open enrollment periods could encounter challenges.\n\nWoods is GAO\u2019s director of acquisition and sourcing management. Rep. Morgan Griffith, R-Va., questioned him on HealthCare.gov\u2019s readiness, asking whether consumers were going to experience problems like those that occurred last October: site crashes, long wait times, bugs in the system.\n\nAlthough Woods told lawmakers that in his view risks remain, he noted that CMS said it intended to analyze and mitigate any issues.\n\nSubcommittee members also expressed concern about the ballooning costs of a contract awarded to Accenture, the technology firm tapped to fix HealthCare.gov.\n\nAfter the online insurance exchange rolled out to system failures and malfunctions last fall, CMS fired CGI Federal, the Canadian company that built it. In January, the agency awarded a one-year, no-bid contract to Accenture to repair the website and improve its functionality.\n\nSo far, the Washington, D.C.-based firm has received $175 million from the federal government for its work on HealthCare.gov \u2014 nearly double the $91 million price tag on the original contract.\n\nAnd Woods said the bill likely will continue to rise, based on GAO\u2019s review of taxpayers\u2019 dollars paid to Accenture several months ago.\n\n\u201cThe costs on that contract are almost certainly higher than before,\u201d the GAO official said.\n\nCMS rebutted by arguing that the rising charges resulted from reassessed tasks. The total cost of HealthCare.gov and related systems currently is close to $1 billion.\n\nFollowing the hearing, Republican oversight leaders \u2014 Sens. Orrin Hatch of Utah, Chuck Grassley of Iowa, and Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, and Reps. Dave Camp and Fred Upton, both of Michigan \u2014 sent a letter to CMS Administrator Marilyn Tavenner asking questions about HealthCare.gov contracts. They wrote:\n\nAmericans deserve a government that is held accountable, and that accountability should extend to the companies that work for the federal government.\n\nThe lawmakers also asked why the Accenture contract increased in cost and what the agency\u2019s estimate is for the final bill.\n\nThe Energy and Commerce Committee has held roughly a dozen hearings on implementation of the Affordable Care Act and the effects of the health care law. The GAO report lays out specific CMS management issues that could spell trouble for the next open enrollment period.\n\nAmericans generally were in favor of the law when Congress passed it in 2010. However, tracking polls by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that support fell to new lows after HealthCare.gov\u2019s rocky launch last year.\n\nMore of those surveyed say they favor Obamacare \u2014 37 percent \u2014 now than in October. Still, 53 percent \u2014 the highest since Congress passed the law \u2014 have an unfavorable opinion.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Three months before HealthCare.gov re-opens to Americans seeking insurance through Obamacare, overseers worry that consumers could \u201cencounter challenges.\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Three months before HealthCare.gov re-opens to Americans seeking insurance through Obamacare, overseers worry that consumers could \u201cencounter challenges.\u201d", "title": "Pressure on Obamacare Agency to Be Ready for More Enrollees", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/140731_Agenda_Quin-opt1.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-08-01T18:43:36+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1pN0pja"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Three months before HealthCare.gov re-opens to Americans seeking insurance through Obamacare, overseers worry that consumers could \u201cencounter challenges.\u201d", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/140731_Agenda_Quin-opt1.jpg"}, "title": "Pressure on Obamacare Agency to Be Ready for More Enrollees", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Health Care", "tag": "obamacare", "published_time": "2014-08-01T17:21:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-01T18:43:36+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "HealthCare.gov, William Woods, Government Accountability Office, Morgan Griffith, House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Obamacare, Accenture, CGI Federal, Affordable Care Act"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0095\"", "article_summary": "The agency, part of the Department of Health and Human Services, oversees Obamacare and the associated website HealthCare.gov.\nThe GAO report lays out specific CMS management issues that could spell trouble for the next open enrollment period.\nPublished Wednesday, the report examines the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services\u2019 management of Obamacare contracts.\nThe GAO report calls on CMS to analyze potential risks before new signups begin:CMS needs a mitigation plan to address these issues.\nUnless CMS improves contract management and adheres to a structured governance process, significant risks remain that upcoming open enrollment periods could encounter challenges."}
