Rush Limbaugh said today the reason liberals are lashing out about prayers and gun control in the wake of San Bernardino is because they share the guilt in the shooting.

He said that Democrats are “trying to pin blame on people that had nothing to do with” the massacre, possibly to transfer their “guilt in order to protect their political agenda.”

And Limbaugh does believe that the attack threatens the Democrats’ agenda, especially on terrorism, and was a little stunned by the reluctance in some quarters to label this terrorism.

And after mentioning the New York Daily News cover on meaningless prayers, Limbaugh said the left clearly shares guilt here.

It is never more obvious to me than it is today,” he said, “that the left knows it is responsible for this. The left knows that it is as guilty as those pulling the trigger here, and they’re doing everything they can to transfer that guilt and cover it up.”
