Unfortunately, over 65 percent of Americans are now either overweight or obese, and the extra weight costs employers in terms of productivity, healthcare costs, increased employee absences, and chronic health conditions. Couple those statistics with the Affordable Care Act, and employers are in a position where they need help improving their staff\u2019s health.\n\nWe\u2019re all about improvement and prevention, not perfection. Our goal is to break the trend in declining employee health and cultivating a culture of health and wellness in the workplace.\n\nWhat is the best part about owning this business: Seeing the changes in our client\u2019s employees- greater productivity, healthier lifestyles, and reduced healthcare expenses.\n\nWhat has been the biggest surprise that has happened since the opening: How many people who are completely unaware of their health conditions.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Business Name: TRS WellnessLocation: Conway\tTelephone: 501-358-6013Website: www.trswellness.com\t\tDate Opened: Operations began in June 2012; we moved into our new office in May of 2014Number of Employees: 8What Type of Business is it: Corporate and Industrial Wellness Services", "geo.position": "35.093106;-92.441872", "og": {"site_name": "TheCabin.net - Conway, Arkansas", "description": "Business Name: TRS Wellness \nLocation: Conway  \nTelephone: 501-358-6013 \nWebsite: www.trswellness.", "title": "TRS Wellness ribbon cutting", "url": "http://thecabin.net/news/business/2014-11-08/trs-wellness-ribbon-cutting", "image": "http://thecabin.net/sites/default/files/13867637.jpg", "type": "article"}, "revisit-after": "1 day", "icbm": "35.093106,-92.441872", "keywords": "conway near arkansas, Conway, Arkansas, ARK, Faulkner County, economic, business, community, development, cities, AR, taxes, city guide, relocation, industrial, incentives, chamber, commerce, education, industrial site, commercial site, buildings, manufacturer, employment, media, utilities, government, history, organization, tourism, health care, recreation, directories, statistics, demographics, census, university, college, directory, Greenbrier, Mayflower, Vilonia, Guy, Damascus, Log Cabin Democrat, Toad Suck Daze, Newspaper, 72032", "copyright": "Copyright 2011 The Log Cabin Democrat"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd5931\"", "article_summary": "Our goal is to reduce organizational health risk through biometric-based wellness coaching, health risk assessments, interactive wellness workshops/education, team challenges, and incentive management.\nTRS Wellness emphasizes wellness in the workplace.\nWe empower employees to get and stay healthy while lowering health care costs for all involved.\nTRS Wellness is a subsidiary of Therapy & Rehab Solutions, Inc. of Conway.\nTherapy & Rehab Solutions has been providing therapy services for Conway Regional Health System for over 30 years."}
