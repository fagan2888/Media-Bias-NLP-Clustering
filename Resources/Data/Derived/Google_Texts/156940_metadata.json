In the NewsChannel 8 studio, from left, Larry Hogan, Anthony Brown, Jenna Johnson of The Washington Post, Shawn Anderson of WTOP radio, and Bruce DePuyt of NewsChannel 8.\n\nIt was a more intimate setting Monday for the second TV debate between Republican Larry Hogan Jr. and Anthony Brown in their race for governor. Sitting side by side at a table in the studios of WJLA-News Channel 8 in Arlington the candidates went at it, questioned for an hour by three reporters.\n\n\n\nThe full debate is now available online. There are links to three video segments below.\n\n\n\nHere are the reviews and observations from seven commentators: Melissa Deckman, Blair Lee, Barry Rascovar, Brian Griffiths, Rick Vatz, Blaine Taylor and Len Lazarick. Professor Todd Eberly\u2019s commentary on the race and the debate ran so long that we made it a separate story.\n\n\n\nAnimated and defensive, they connected with their constituencies\n\n\n\nBy Melissa Deckman\n\n\n\nIn this second debate, both Larry Hogan and Anthony Brown were more animated and defensive, which may reflect that the race is tightening. Neither candidate won any major political points but may have further cemented their connection with different constituencies in the state.\n\n\n\nBrown appeared stronger on issues of education, calling into question whether Hogan would properly fund public schools, and also raised the issue of pre-kindergarten again \u2014 although he dodged the question about what happens if gambling funds aren\u2019t enough to extend Pre-K universally as he would like. Brown was also adept at reminding voters about his administration\u2019s commitment to keeping college affordable.\n\n\n\nAnother strength of the debate for Brown came toward the end when he reminded voters that he supported the raise in minimum wage, which also tapped a bit into the gender gap given that women are more likely to be earning the minimum wage more than men. Frankly, I\u2019m surprised that Brown doesn\u2019t do more to appeal to women voters more directly when it comes to economic issues.\n\n\n\nAt the same time, Hogan was very clear about his priorities concerning taxing and spending, and his \u201claser beam focus\u201d on the issues, to use his description, has really set the tone and substance of the campaign thus far. His criticisms about Brown\u2019s role in managing botched health care roll-out were effective.\n\n\n\nHe also planted the seed in voters\u2019 minds that his work under Gov. Bob Ehrlich, as his appointments secretary, was bipartisan in nature, deflecting criticism by Brown that he was perhaps a \u201cbipartisan boss\u201d as opposed to a party boss!\n\n\n\nHogan\u2019s responses were not so great, however, to the claim that his audit numbers are off, the numbers on which he is basing much of his campaign as he pledges to reduce government fraud and waste. Unless he can be clearer about his math errors, which have not only been raised by Brown but by independent observers, he could potentially undercut his major plan for governance.\n\n\n\nHowever, so far, given Hogan\u2019s newness as a political candidate, his debate performances have been solid.\n\n\n\nMelissa Deckman is chair and professor of Political Science as well as Louis L. Goldstein Professor of Public Affairs at Washington College in Chestertown.\n\n\n\nHogan communicates despite biased questioning\n\n\n\nBy Blair Lee\n\n\n\nHogan, on camera, is a better communicator. He was relaxed, confident, conversational and, most important, on message. He\u2019s also good at one-liners (\u201cOur economy is a mess, everybody in Maryland seems to know it but you\u201d). Brown comes across stiff and scripted. When he can\u2019t answer he reverts to Maryland\u2019s AAA bond rating and his military service.\n\n\n\nThe panel was more biased than Debate #1 last Tuesday. \u201cModerator\u201d Bruce DePuyt led by asking Hogan this loaded question, \u201cAre you asking Marylanders to elect someone who opposes their social values?\u201d And have you stopped beating your wife? Three times the panel asked about Hogan\u2019s flawed $1.7 billion savings audit list, especially his alleged $450 school construction cuts. Likewise, the panel made gun control a big deal. In the real world of one-party Annapolis, none of these scare scenarios can happen, even if governor Hogan wanted to.\n\n\n\nBut at least the panel brought up Brown\u2019s Obamacare website fiasco. Brown accepted some blame but claimed eventual success, \u201cWe rolled up our sleeves and got it done\u201d).\n\n\n\nSubstance. Much like Debate # 1, the chief dynamic was Hogan hanging the status quo around Brown\u2019s neck. Brown wants to \u201cmake this election about the future, not the past\u201d but on every issue \u2014 taxes, environment, jobs, economy, etc. \u2014 Hogan asks: Why didn\u2019t you accomplish it during the eight years you and O\u2019Malley were in charge?\n\n\n\nHogan (and the polls) say Md. is headed in the wrong direction, the economy stinks and taxes are too high. Brown is forced to either disagree or change the subject.\n\n\n\nBrown\u2019s offensive. Unlike Debate # 1, Brown came out swinging. He challenged Hogan on minimum wage, cleaning up the Bay, corporate taxes, education spending, gun control, etc. Some of his punches were comically wild; Hogan caused higher ed tuition hikes because he worked in the Ehrlich administration, Hogan is \u201ca partisan boss,\u201d Hogan\u2019s running mate (Boyd Rutherford) was involved in a scandal.\n\n\n\nHogan\u2019s one-liner response, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the Ehrlich-Hogan administration, but you are the O\u2019Malley-Brown administration.\u201d Even if the media helpfully echoes Brown\u2019s charges they are only distractions from what appears to concern voters this election.\n\n\n\nBottom line. These debates help the underfunded Hogan communicate with voters while Brown is left defending an unpopular governor and a flawed record.\n\n\n\nBlair Lee is a columnist at the Gazette newspapers, chairman of the board of Lee Development Group in Silver Spring and a regular commentator for WBAL radio. His email address is blairleeiv@gmail.com.\n\n\n\nHogan got more aggressive\n\n\n\nBy Brian Griffiths\n\n\n\nMonday\u2019s debate was a lot chipper than the one that we saw last Tuesday.\n\n\n\nThe biggest theme I noticed was how much more aggressive Larry Hogan was in challenging the assertions made, especially those which were made by Anthony Brown. Especially impactful was Hogan\u2019s point that \u201cBoyd Rutherford is the most qualified man ever to run for Lt. Governor\u201d was not just accurate, but also a direct shot at Anthony Brown\u2019s qualifications to serve as governor, something that many people on both sides of the aisle have openly questioned.\n\n\n\nThis is exactly the kind of aggressive campaign that we were looking forward to when we at Red Maryland enthusiastically endorsed Larry Hogan for Governor last fall.\n\n\n\nAnthony Brown\u2019s clung to his already discredited talking points on women\u2019s health and guns, though he did try to turn a little more focus onto jobs, education spending, and taxes. The problem for Brown though is the fact that by doing so he exposed his weakness in these areas.\n\n\n\nTaking credit for Under Armor\u2019s success was amusing. More amusing was Brown\u2019s assertion about how he was going to balance the budget, during a time in which the O\u2019Malley-Brown administration oversaw a $10 billion increase in state spending, structural deficits waiting for the next administration, and property tax increases baked into future budgets due to the spending hikes championed by O\u2019Malley and Brown.\n\n\n\nBrown\u2019s continued attempts to tie Hogan to Bob Ehrlich\u2019s record fall flat on a number of levels. One, Larry Hogan was a cabinet secretary and not the lieutenant governor as Brown is. Secondly, Anthony Brown is in the room now whereas the Ehrlich administration ended eight years ago. The \u201cbackroom deals\u201d comment was amusing given the cronyism we have seen during the O\u2019Malley-Brown years and the Land Deals that the O\u2019Malley-Brown team were working out with their political allies at the beginning of their administration.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s enlightening that Brown wants to blame the Ehrlich administration for the last eight years of the O\u2019Malley-Brown administration\u2019s shortcomings, and merely continues to feed the perception that Anthony Brown is an empty suit.\n\n\n\nMore structured and focused\n\n\n\nOn the media end of it, this debate was much more focused and structured than the WJZ/Baltimore Sun debate. Unlike the first debate, where Vic Carter and Andy Green decided to not ask a question about such an important issue, the moderators did ask about Anthony Brown\u2019s role in the failed health care exchange roll out. Two of the three moderators, Bruce DePuyt of NewsChannel8 and Shawn Anderson of WTOP radio were both on point and asked relevant questions.\n\n\n\nJenna Johnson of the Washington Post on the other hand should never be allowed to moderate a debate ever again. She seemed to be aloof and more interested in carrying Anthony Brown\u2019s water than in being a relevant contributor to the debate process. While that shouldn\u2019t be a surprise by a Post reporter who has written pointless articles like this one about the Governor\u2019s race, she brought absolutely nothing to the debate.\n\n\n\nHer question about school construction spending, well after both candidates had already addressed the issue, showed she was interested more in either talking about what she wanted to talk about or getting herself over as a journalist than she did in contributing to the public discourse. I hope future debates have serious journalists involved, and not Jenna Johnson.\n\n\n\nThe least surprising thing about the debate? Larry Hogan took questions from reporters afterward again, while Anthony Brown ran away.\n\n\n\nHogan\u2019s aggressive nature and Brown\u2019s defensive responses tell us a lot about the state of play in this race and how the last three weeks are going to play out.\n\n\n\nBrian Griffiths is an editor and commentator at the partisan Red Maryland blog.\n\n\n\nChalk up a big one for Anthony Brown\n\n\n\nBy Barry Rascovar, Political Maryland.com\n\n\n\nChalk one up \u2013 a big one \u2013 for Anthony Brown.\n\n\n\nIn a campaign marked by wild accusations and harsh, over-the-top negativity, the Democratic candidate for Maryland governor finally started talking policy in the second televised debate.\n\n\n\nNot all the time, mind you, but at least one of the contenders gave voters a clearer idea of how he\u2019d govern Maryland over the next four years.\n\n\n\nRepublican Larry Hogan Jr. missed a prime opportunity to gain ground. Time after time he failed to offer specifics on how he\u2019d clean up the Chesapeake Bay, how he\u2019d deal with gun laws, how he\u2019d jump-start the state\u2019s economy and how he\u2019d improve education.\n\n\n\nHogan totally dodged pointed questions about whether he\u2019d name a new State Police superintendent with the goal of liberalizing the issuance of concealed weapons permits.\n\n\n\nHe refused to acknowledge or refute a Washington Post story that he had made promises to gun advocates at a private meeting.\n\n\n\nHogan avoided giving details throughout the debate. He offered little beyond his distaste for past tax increases, his pessimistic view of Maryland\u2019s economy and his wish to create more jobs.\n\n\n\nHe gave no concrete examples of how he\u2019d lower state spending or pump up Maryland\u2019s economy.\n\n\n\nWhere\u2019s the beef? There was none.\n\n\n\nBrown got specific, Hogan wasn\u2019t\n\n\n\nBrown, at least, stopped finger-pointing long enough to give a hint of how he\u2019d run the state. He provided an understandable explanation of the botched health exchange rollout and a defense of Obamacare, i.e., giving 410,000 more Marylanders health insurance.\n\n\n\nHe far outdistanced Hogan in his response to protecting Maryland waterways against stormwater pollution. He repeated his pledge to use tax credits and tax cuts to spur small business development.\n\n\n\nHe defended his call for universal pre-kindergarten through a phased-in program. He committed to rapid-rail expansions that Hogan wants stopped.\n\n\n\nHe placed deserved emphasis on career and technical education (the old vocational-tech courses) to make high school students job-ready if they\u2019re not college-bound.\n\n\n\nHogan harped on familiar themes he\u2019s used throughout this campaign with no detail about how he\u2019d turn ideas into reality.\n\n\n\nIn contrast, Brown finally started giving voters hints of a governance plan. He came across as competent, knowledgeable and substantive.\n\n\n\nFor Brown, it was Mission Accomplished.\n\n\n\nBarry Rascovar has been reporting on Maryland politics for over 40 years and writes a weekly column for MarylandReporter.com and his own blog, politicalMaryland.com.\n\n\n\nThe dandy versus rough around the edges: Nod goes to Hogan\n\n\n\nBy Richard E. Vatz\n\n\n\nI suppose this will be what passes for a fair debate on NewsChannel 8, with no obvious prejudice but with The Washington Post\u2019s Jenna Johnson asking repeatedly one-sided questions in favor of Anthony Brown and with his (Brown\u2019s) getting three shots at the devastating legacy and cost ($288 million, said Larry Hogan) of the healthcare run-up, while Hogan got one.\n\n\n\nMuch of the debate otherwise was a replay of the campaign this far: Brown was more rhetorically dexterous and Hogan was incredulous at what he claimed were false imputations of policy arguments and positions.\n\n\n\nThe format allowed some ad hoc participation, and I think if you add up the minutes, Brown was advantaged by this. It was not outrageous, and the debate as a whole was generally informative, even if it was not quite up to the fairness and equity in the WJZ-Baltimore Sun debate.\n\n\n\nBruce DePuyt was a fair enough moderator, and he and questioner WTOP\u2019s Shawn Anderson were just fine in their roles, but Ms. Johnson, as noted, appeared to be consistently quasi-hostile to Hogan. Writing several days ago on Brown\u2019s accusation that Hogan\u2019s \u201cprivately telling \u2018extreme\u2019 gun-rights activists that he would use executive orders to roll back some gun-control measures \u2014 something that Hogan has publicly said he would not do,\u201d she became what we call in persuasion theory a \u201cspecial pleader,\u201d pressing and pressing this issue after it had been discussed earlier in the debate.\n\n\n\nAgain, Hogan denied he would do any such thing, as Johnson had written in the Post a week ago, and that he could not respond to unnamed sources. Perhaps he can be asked about this four or five more times.\n\n\n\nStandard issues and responses\n\n\n\nThere were the standard issues and responses, and, again, Hogan\u2019s general attack was that Brown had solutions to problems that he was part and parcel of creating as lieutenant governor and that Brown had never publicly spoken up about such matters. Hogan asked if Brown ever voiced his objection to Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley concerning his misgivings, but Brown never addressed that.\n\n\n\nThe weakest Brownian answers concerned the question by DePuyt, \u201cAre Marylanders overtaxed?\u201d and Brown said yet again that he didn\u2019t see the need for raising taxes, but never addressed the question or why he should be believed that he would not raise taxes when he had made the same promise four years ago. There were also no answers to the $10 billion spending rise, the loss of jobs, the rise in unemployment (despite the infusion of federal jobs, unmentioned by Hogan) or who was responsible for Maryland fiscal policy if not the governor and lieutenant governor.\n\n\n\nI am going to jump off the Tallahatchie Bridge if Hogan again pursues his \u201cpursuing mental illness history will cut down on gun violence\u201d argument without ever giving any evidence that such pursuit has had any effect whatsoever. Why don\u2019t reporters question him on this? Because they believe that \u201cmental illness\u201d is the cause of gun violence, without any evidence as well.\n\n\n\nFinally, as a pox on both their houses, is no one going to talk about the elephant in American society, single parent households which contribute outrageously disproportionately to crime and other social pathologies, or is the answer just to buy government overseeing of our children at earlier and earlier ages, say pre-K and pre-pre-K education?\n\n\n\nI must say that as disappointed as I was substantively in Anthony Brown\u2019s evasions and sophistry, his elocution is near-perfect. I hope my students someday present as well as he. Hogan\u2019s is not bad as a rough style, often associated with ingenuous honesty, but most audiences prefer style such as Brown\u2019s.\n\n\n\nEdge to Hogan.\n\n\n\nProfessor Vatz teaches Persuasion at Towson University and is author of The Only Authentic Book of Persuasion: the Agenda-Spin Model (Kendall Hunt: 2013)\n\n\n\nMany more issues were covered\n\n\n\nBy Blaine Taylor\n\n\n\nA far better debate than the first, in which many more issues were covered, and more hardball questions were asked\u2014and sometimes answered\u2014on both sides.\n\n\n\nThe lieutenant governor\u2019s answer on the Health Care rollout debacle was a non-answer, and that is simply because he is defending an indefensible blunder on his part. Nothing was said, either, about the hands-on director of that boondoggle, and should be, hopefully in the next debate.\n\n\n\nWe learned a lot about Mr. Hogan\u2019s running mate, but still know zero of the lieutenant governor\u2019s, Howard County Executive Ken Ulman. Hopefully we\u2019ll hear about him as well in the next debate.\n\n\n\nAnother person we didn\u2019t hear about\u2014and should\u2014is why the lieutenant governor still hasn\u2019t repudiated the conduct of his former mentor, State Sen. Ulysses Currie. That, too, is indefensible.\n\n\n\nI close with an opinion about the always much-ballyhooed Maryland Triple A bond rating. Rather than something that politicians can and always do embrace, to me\u2014as both a voter and a citizen\u2014it represents what is wrong about both state and federal government. It allows them all to borrow more money that we simply shouldn\u2019t spend. We need to get our governments and ourselves back on cash and carry operational conduct. We stepped on the slippery slope of debt in government via the Triple A Bond Rating, and in our personal lives, via out of control credit card misuse.\n\n\n\nBoth as voters and as spenders, we have met the enemy, and it is us. We need to save ourselves from ourselves, and I hope that the next debate will focus on this and the other items mentioned above.\n\n\n\nBlaine Taylor is an author who has run for U.S. Senate and House as a Democrat.\n\n\n\nNot much new but a good summary of the campaign\n\n\n\nBy Len Lazarick, Len@MarylandReporter.com\n\n\n\nWhat did anyone who\u2019s been paying attention to this 2014 campaign learn from the second debate?\n\n\n\nNot much at all. But someone who hadn\u2019t been paying very much attention would have gotten a good taste of the men\u2019s personalities and positions, along with their usual misrepresentations, half-truths, inaccuracies and accomplishments. Some of the inaccuracies have been pointed out before.\n\n\n\nHogan is more comfortable in a less formal setting, needs a haircut in the back, and shows a good sense of humor. Brown is reliably disciplined to stay on message, but as countless people have probably told him most of his life, he needs to loosen up a bit.\n\n\n\nI have no way to come at these men with a fresh eye. Over four years and more, I\u2019ve seen them both in public and in private, and interviewed them both briefly and at length before they were in the heat of the campaign. To their credit, they have both chosen men as their lieutenant governor running mates who are at least as bright as they are and certainly more experienced in actually running large government operations.\n\n\n\nIf you managed to get to the end of the debate and hear their closing remarks, both candidates strongly articulated why they are running. Brown\u2019s recounting of his military service is in such compelling contrast to what you might expect from someone with his Harvard education.\n\n\n\n\u201cToday, I\u2019m on a different mission,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n\u201cI happen to believe that our state is way off track,\u201d said Hogan. He hopes Marylanders will vote \u201cto go in a different direction,\u201d while his opponent represents \u201canother four years, another O\u2019Malley term.\u201d\n\n\n\nThey both agree, as Hogan puts it, \u201cthis is a fight for Maryland\u2019s future,\u201d or as Brown puts it \u201cThis election is not about the past, it\u2019s about the future.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe debate really did dwell on the past. While they\u2019ve given us some inkling of what aspects of that future might be, what that future might look like with either man as governor is still fairly vague.\n\n\n\nLen Lazarick is the founding editor and publisher of MarylandReporter.com.

Larry Hogan took questions from reporters afterward again, while Anthony Brown ran away.Hogan\u2019s aggressive nature and Brown\u2019s defensive responses tell us a lot about the state of play in this race and how the last three weeks are going to play out.Chalk one up \u2013 a big one \u2013 for Anthony Brown.In a campaign marked by wild accusations and harsh, over-the-top negativity, the Democratic candidate for Maryland governor finally started talking policy in the second televised debate.Not all the time, mind you, but at least one of the contenders gave voters a clearer idea of how he\u2019d govern Maryland over the next four years.Republican Larry Hogan Jr. missed a prime opportunity to gain ground. Time after time he failed to offer specifics on how he\u2019d clean up the Chesapeake Bay, how he\u2019d deal with gun laws, how he\u2019d jump-start the state\u2019s economy and how he\u2019d improve education.Hogan totally dodged pointed questions about whether he\u2019d name a new State Police superintendent with the goal of liberalizing the issuance of concealed weapons permits.He refused to acknowledge or refute a Washington Post story that he had made promises to gun advocates at a private meeting.Hogan avoided giving details throughout the debate. He offered little beyond his distaste for past tax increases, his pessimistic view of Maryland\u2019s economy and his wish to create more jobs.He gave no concrete examples of how he\u2019d lower state spending or pump up Maryland\u2019s economy.Where\u2019s the beef? There was none.Brown, at least, stopped finger-pointing long enough to give a hint of how he\u2019d run the state. He provided an understandable explanation of the botched health exchange rollout and a defense of Obamacare, i.e., giving 410,000 more Marylanders health insurance.He far outdistanced Hogan in his response to protecting Maryland waterways against stormwater pollution. He repeated his pledge to use tax credits and tax cuts to spur small business development.He defended his call for universal pre-kindergarten through a phased-in program. He committed to rapid-rail expansions that Hogan wants stopped.He placed deserved emphasis on career and technical education (the old vocational-tech courses) to make high school students job-ready if they\u2019re not college-bound.Hogan harped on familiar themes he\u2019s used throughout this campaign with no detail about how he\u2019d turn ideas into reality.In contrast, Brown finally started giving voters hints of a governance plan. He came across as competent, knowledgeable and substantive.For Brown, it was Mission Accomplished.I suppose this will be what passes for a fair debate on NewsChannel 8, with no obvious prejudice but with The Washington Post\u2019s Jenna Johnson asking repeatedly one-sided questions in favor of Anthony Brown and with his (Brown\u2019s) getting three shots at the devastating legacy and cost ($288 million, said Larry Hogan) of the healthcare run-up, while Hogan got one.Much of the debate otherwise was a replay of the campaign this far: Brown was more rhetorically dexterous and Hogan was incredulous at what he claimed were false imputations of policy arguments and positions.The format allowed some ad hoc participation, and I think if you add up the minutes, Brown was advantaged by this. It was not outrageous, and the debate as a whole was generally informative, even if it was not quite up to the fairness and equity in the WJZ-Baltimore Sun debate.Bruce DePuyt was a fair enough moderator, and he and questioner WTOP\u2019s Shawn Anderson were just fine in their roles, but Ms. Johnson, as noted, appeared to be consistently quasi-hostile to Hogan. Writing several days ago on Brown\u2019s accusation that Hogan\u2019s \u201cprivately telling \u2018extreme\u2019 gun-rights activists that he would use executive orders to roll back some gun-control measures \u2014 something that Hogan has publicly said he would not do,\u201d she became what we call in persuasion theory a \u201cspecial pleader,\u201d pressing and pressing this issue after it had been discussed earlier in the debate.Again, Hogan denied he would do any such thing, as Johnson had written in the Post a week ago, and that he could not respond to unnamed sources. Perhaps he can be asked about this four or five more times.There were the standard issues and responses, and, again, Hogan\u2019s general attack was that Brown had solutions to problems that he was part and parcel of creating as lieutenant governor and that Brown had never publicly spoken up about such matters. Hogan asked if Brown ever voiced his objection to Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley concerning his misgivings, but Brown never addressed that.The weakest Brownian answers concerned the question by DePuyt, \u201cAre Marylanders overtaxed?\u201d and Brown said yet again that he didn\u2019t see the need for raising taxes, but never addressed the question or why he should be believed that he would not raise taxes when he had made the same promise four years ago. There were also no answers to the $10 billion spending rise, the loss of jobs, the rise in unemployment (despite the infusion of federal jobs, unmentioned by Hogan) or who was responsible for Maryland fiscal policy if not the governor and lieutenant governor.I am going to jump off the Tallahatchie Bridge if Hogan again pursues his \u201cpursuing mental illness history will cut down on gun violence\u201d argument without ever giving any evidence that such pursuit has had any effect whatsoever. Why don\u2019t reporters question him on this? Because they believe that \u201cmental illness\u201d is the cause of gun violence, without any evidence as well.Finally, as a pox on both their houses, is no one going to talk about the elephant in American society, single parent households which contribute outrageously disproportionately to crime and other social pathologies, or is the answer just to buy government overseeing of our children at earlier and earlier ages, say pre-K and pre-pre-K education?I must say that as disappointed as I was substantively in Anthony Brown\u2019s evasions and sophistry, his elocution is near-perfect. I hope my students someday present as well as he. Hogan\u2019s is not bad as a rough style, often associated with ingenuous honesty, but most audiences prefer style such as Brown\u2019s.Edge to Hogan.A far better debate than the first, in which many more issues were covered, and more hardball questions were asked\u2014and sometimes answered\u2014on both sides.The lieutenant governor\u2019s answer on the Health Care rollout debacle was a non-answer, and that is simply because he is defending an indefensible blunder on his part. Nothing was said, either, about the hands-on director of that boondoggle, and should be, hopefully in the next debate.We learned a lot about Mr. Hogan\u2019s running mate, but still know zero of the lieutenant governor\u2019s, Howard County Executive Ken Ulman. Hopefully we\u2019ll hear about him as well in the next debate.Another person we didn\u2019t hear about\u2014and should\u2014is why the lieutenant governor still hasn\u2019t repudiated the conduct of his former mentor, State Sen. Ulysses Currie. That, too, is indefensible.I close with an opinion about the always much-ballyhooed Maryland Triple A bond rating. Rather than something that politicians can and always do embrace, to me\u2014as both a voter and a citizen\u2014it represents what is wrong about both state and federal government. It allows them all to borrow more money that we simply shouldn\u2019t spend. We need to get our governments and ourselves back on cash and carry operational conduct. We stepped on the slippery slope of debt in government via the Triple A Bond Rating, and in our personal lives, via out of control credit card misuse.Both as voters and as spenders, we have met the enemy, and it is us. We need to save ourselves from ourselves, and I hope that the next debate will focus on this and the other items mentioned above.What did anyone who\u2019s been paying attention to this 2014 campaign learn from the second debate?Not much at all. But someone who hadn\u2019t been paying very much attention would have gotten a good taste of the men\u2019s personalities and positions, along with their usual misrepresentations, half-truths, inaccuracies and accomplishments. Some of the inaccuracies have been pointed out before.Hogan is more comfortable in a less formal setting, needs a haircut in the back, and shows a good sense of humor. Brown is reliably disciplined to stay on message, but as countless people have probably told him most of his life, he needs to loosen up a bit.I have no way to come at these men with a fresh eye. Over four years and more, I\u2019ve seen them both in public and in private, and interviewed them both briefly and at length before they were in the heat of the campaign. To their credit, they have both chosen men as their lieutenant governor running mates who are at least as bright as they are and certainly more experienced in actually running large government operations.If you managed to get to the end of the debate and hear their closing remarks, both candidates strongly articulated why they are running. Brown\u2019s recounting of his military service is in such compelling contrast to what you might expect from someone with his Harvard education.\u201cToday, I\u2019m on a different mission,\u201d he said.\u201cI happen to believe that our state is way off track,\u201d said Hogan. He hopes Marylanders will vote \u201cto go in a different direction,\u201d while his opponent represents \u201canother four years, another O\u2019Malley term.\u201dThey both agree, as Hogan puts it, \u201cthis is a fight for Maryland\u2019s future,\u201d or as Brown puts it \u201cThis election is not about the past, it\u2019s about the future.\u201dThe debate really did dwell on the past. While they\u2019ve given us some inkling of what aspects of that future might be, what that future might look like with either man as governor is still fairly vague.
