A man died when he lost control and drove into a pond in Boulder sometime overnight.

A jogger in Boulder discovered the vehicle submerged in a pond with one person inside on Sunday morning, according to the Colorado State Patrol.

The driver lost control while turning onto eastbound U.S. 36 from Foothills Parkway, said patrol spokesman Tim Sutherland.

A man was removed from the vehicle and taken to a hospital, where he was declared dead, Sutherland said.

As a precaution, divers from Boulder Fire-Rescue are searching the area near the car to make sure no one else is in the water.
