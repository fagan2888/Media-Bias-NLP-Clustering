Immigration? Don\u2019t send them home, send them to Detroit. They\u2019re in need of about a million people. Suicidal veterans? Open up all the shuttered military bases as vet centers where they can live for free with other guys like themselves who understand whatever it is they\u2019re going through. Abortion? Have the medical community lead the country to adopt the same brain wave standard for birth as we do for death. If a specific type of brain wave determines whether you\u2019re alive or not at the end of life, why should that be different for the beginning of life?\n\nChristopher Buckley is a master at creative solutions.\n\nEven more fun are the situations you can put people in. If you\u2019re in the mood, you can dress Michele and Marcus Bachmann in latex or send Rick Santorum to the ER with a hamster problem. I once had Dick Cheney delivered to The Hague in the dead of night, left handcuffed in a courtroom wearing his jammies, with a videotape of himself bragging about enhanced interrogations chained around his neck . (I let The Hague put him on trial. Now what does the newly elected President Obama do? Spoiler alert, in the end you find out it was the Navy Seals who captured Cheney on Obama\u2019s order.)\n\nBut sometimes, life is stranger than fiction, and real life people behave in ways you never suspect they had in them. That\u2019s what happened when Judge Julia Smith Gibbons wrote the opinion in a case that was heard by the Sixth Circuit Appeals Court en banc, in which a for-profit corporation claimed providing birth control coverage to its employees violated the religious freedom of the owner.\n\nJulia Smith Gibbons has impeccable conservative credentials. Vanderbilt undergrad. U of Virginia Law. Fresh out of law school, she clerked for a conservative judge on the Sixth Circuit and after a couple of years in private practice she joined Tennessee Governor Lamar Alexander\u2019s staff. Ronald Reagan appointed her to the federal bench and W elevated her to the Sixth Circuit in 2003. Her husband Bill Gibbons is a former district attorney who ran on the Republican ticket for governor of Tennessee three years ago. I bet she even has a string of pearls.\n\nThe Sixth Circuit upheld the provision in Obamacare that says an employer must offer contraception coverage. Court watchers expected Julia Smith Gibbons to dissent. Instead, she wrote the opinion for the unanimous decision. In it she says corporations are not people, so they can\u2019t have a religion. Judge Smith wrote what we wish the Supreme Court had decided about corporations in Citizens United; that the reason corporations are created:\n\n\u201cis to create a distinct legal entity, with legal rights, obligations, powers, and privileges different from those of the natural individuals who created it, who own it, or whom it employs.\u201d\n\nAppellate courts have split on the legality of the contraception requirement in the Affordable Care Act, which means the Supreme Court will probably be the final arbiter of the issue. The High Court has the power to discard Judge Gibbons assertion that corporations are not people, and declare them all members of the Westboro Baptist Church. I\u2019m sure none of us would even be surprised.\n\nBut maybe not. The decision of the very conservative Julia Smith Gibbons should be seen as a glimmer of hope. Until now, the Supreme Court has always limited religious liberty claims to \u201cindividuals and non-profit religious organizations.\u201d Perhaps this is one of those times when Chief Justice Roberts will read the Six Circuit\u2019s decision by Judge Gibbons and worry about his place in history. He can\u2019t be happy that his court\u2019s \u201ccorporations are people\u201d decision has become the punchline of a national joke.\n\nSo let\u2019s give a nod of appreciation to the judge who tweaked the High Court\u2019s nose about their disastrous decision in Citizen\u2019s United. Today, Judge Julia Smith Gibbons, and her declaration that corporations aren\u2019t people, are On Our Radar.\n\nPhoto: Wiki\n\n\n\nJean Ann Esselink is a straight friend to the gay community.
