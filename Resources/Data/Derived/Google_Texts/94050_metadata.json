But it will probably be smaller than last year\u2019s deficit, and will be the lowest since President Obama took office.\n\nThe good news surprised the budget counters at the CBO.\n\n\u201cReceipts for the first seven months of fiscal year 2015 totaled $1,892 billion, CBO estimates \u2014 $155 billion more than receipts in the same period last year. That increase is roughly $40 billion larger than what CBO expected when it published its March 2015 report,\u201d the nonpartisan agency said in its report.\n\nSEE ALSO: Senate adopts GOP budget targeting \u2018Obamacare\u2019\n\nThe fiscal year runs from Oct. 1 through Sept. 30.\n\nBoth taxes and spending are growing rapidly, at 9 percent and 7 percent, respectively.\n\nThe CBO said the biggest spending increases are in Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security \u2014 the big entitlement programs that are essentially on autopilot, with costs increasing as more poor, disabled and elderly people become eligible. Combined, they are up some $81 billion compared to the same time period from fiscal year 2014.\n\nDefense spending is down, dropping by nearly 4 percent.\n\nThose defense cuts worry many congressional Republicans, who say given the global dangers to the U.S., it\u2019s the wrong time to be trimming security spending.\n\nThis week Congress cleared a GOP-written budget for 2016 that would boost defense spending, using a budget trick to get around limits imposed under the 2011 \u201csequester\u201d deal. But Democrats, led by Mr. Obama, have insisted they won\u2019t accept any increase in defense spending unless it\u2019s coupled with domestic spending hikes. They don\u2019t count entitlements in those calculations, since those programs are deemed \u201cmandatory\u201d spending, and are on autopilot.\n\nSocial Security has risen 4 percent this year, and Medicare has risen 8 percent, after unanticipated spending increases in 2014 left the government with a big bill at the beginning of this fiscal year.\n\nBut the biggest leap has been in Medicaid, the federal-state partnership that provides health care to the poor, and which is up 22 percent, or $36 billion, over the previous year. CBO analysts said the increase was chiefly due to Obamacare, which has pushed millions of new customers into the program, drawing ever-more resources.\n\nOverall, the government has taken in $1.89 trillion in revenue, and spent $2.18 trillion through the first seven months of the fiscal year.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The federal government set a record tax haul in April, taking in nearly a half-trillion dollars in one month alone, according to Congressional Budget Office statistics released Thursday.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The federal government set a record tax haul in April, taking in nearly a half-trillion dollars in one month alone, according to Congressional Budget Office statistics released Thursday.", "title": "Feds set tax haul record: $472B in one month", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/may/7/feds-set-tax-haul-record-472-billion-one-month/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/02/6ec0257a52dcff056c0f6a70670014a4.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/02/6ec0257a52dcff056c0f6a70670014a4.jpg", "description": "The federal government set a record tax haul in April, taking in nearly a half-trillion dollars in one month alone, according to Congressional Budget Office statistics released Thursday.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Feds set tax haul record: $472B in one month"}, "Author": "Stephen Dinan", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Business Finance, Social Issues, Politics, Congressional Budget Office"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0dc9\"", "article_summary": "The federal government set a record tax haul in April, taking in nearly a half-trillion dollars in one month alone, according to Congressional Budget Office statistics released Thursday.\nBut Democrats, led by Mr. Obama, have insisted they won\u2019t accept any increase in defense spending unless it\u2019s coupled with domestic spending hikes.\nSpending, meanwhile, was a more modest $317 billion, leaving the government with a surplus for that one month of $155 billion \u2014 also a record.\nApril is always a busy month with the tax deadline on April 15, but this year\u2019s haul was historic, totaling $472 billion, far outstripping the previous monthly record, set last April, of $414 billion.\nDefense spending is down, dropping by nearly 4 percent."}
