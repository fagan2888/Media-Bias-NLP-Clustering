L.L.C.\u2019s Wearable Advanced Sensor Platform shirt is meant to keep firefighters safe. The flame-resistant, moisture-wicking T-shirt contains sensors that track the wearer\u2019s heart rate, respiration rate and other factors. And the Pittsfield, New Hampshire company also makes a belt, with a unit the size of a deck of cards to provide location data in GPS-denied areas, a firefighter can wear around the waist.\n\nBecause of the high costs and privacy concerns regarding certain wearables, it will take time for them to get traction with employers, said Jake Steinerman, the Midland, Michigan-based co-founder and team lead for\n\napp developer DriveSafe. But that hasn\u2019t stopped him from developing an app for Google Glass, which is worn like eyeglasses and functions like a smartphone, to alert drivers when their eyes begin to close.\n\nMr. Steinerman, whose idea came from a long, tiring drive, began working on DriveSafe with his team after he was selected as one of 8,000 Glass Explorers last year. The Explorer program, open to anyone willing to spend $1,500 on Glass, is the only way now to buy a Google Glass prototype.\n\nDriveSafe still is being fine-tuned, but \u201cthere\u2019s been a lot of interest from insurance companies and other companies that develop software and some hardware for the trucking and shipping industry,\u201d Mr. Steinerman said. \u201cThat\u2019s really where we see a lot of potential on the road, for these guys who are driving 12 to 14 hours or more a day.\u201d\n\nAs the cost of Google Glass drops and more apps are developed, the Glass technology \u201cwill be built right into protective goggles,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve started to see is a bigger push and better-use cases today for industry as opposed to the consumer market.\u201d\n\nPatrick Jackson, a firefighter in Rocky Mount, North Carolina, developed another Google Glass app that gives firefighters hands-free access to information such as building floor plans, extraction diagrams for vehicles and fire hydrant locations, according to the Explorer program website.\n\nNot all wearable devices promoting safety and health track vital signs or facilitate communication.\n\nThe Chairless Chair, for example, provides lightweight leg supports that act as an exoskeleton, relieving stress on leg muscles and joints when locked in a sitting position, said inventor Keith Gunura, the Zurich-based CEO and co-founder of the company noonee, so named as a play on \u201cnew knee\u201d or \u201cno knee problems.\u201d\n\nThe exoskeleton, which is attached with straps at the waist and thighs, allows workers who are typically on their feet to sit, but still stand, walk or run when it\u2019s not activated, Mr. Gunura said.\n\nWhile it doesn\u2019t offer Bluetooth capabilities or enhance strength, it does aim to prevent workers from developing musculoskeletal disorders after spending years on their feet, he said.\n\nCar manufactures have expressed interest in piloting the Chairless Chair in Germany, Mr. Gunura said. BMW A.G. reportedly is starting production line trials this month, and Audi A.G. will do so later this year. Neither could be reached for comment.\n\nInnovent Technologies L.L.C., a Peabody, Massachusetts, manufacturer of components and systems used in making computer chips, is another potential customer.\n\nInnovent President Felix Twaalfhoven said many of the company\u2019s 55 employees stand during their shift because it\u2019s hard to find a narrow enough chair that\u2019s the right height so operators can still move around.\n\n\u201cThe guys in the factory were enthusiastic,\u201d Mr. Twaalfhoven said. \u201cThey elected to try this out and they have asked me to continue to work with Keith to see when we might get the next model.\u201d\n\nNoonee won\u2019t disclose the price of the Chairless Chair until the final model is ready, but Mr. Gunura said it\u2019s more affordable than many wearable devices because of the absence of digital technology.\n\nThere could be a future Chairless Chair model that collects data, such as usage, but \u201cnow is not the time,\u201d he said.\n\nDespite cost and privacy hesitations, more employers will start to see the value wearables can bring to workplaces, experts say.\n\nAs PC World Editor-in-Chief Jon Phillips wrote earlier this year, \u201cThe future of smartglasses will be realized by a factory worker operating a 3,000-pound stamp press, not a gamer stomping on virtual-reality bad guys.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Business Insurance", "description": "Wearable devices could help employers improve the health and safety of their workers.Ranging from Fitbit Inc. fitness trackers to the Chairless Chair, experts say there\u2019s a place for wearables in the workplace.
