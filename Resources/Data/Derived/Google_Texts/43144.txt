One Panama City Beach man is in the Bay County Jail Sunday after he led both the Panama City and Panama City Beach Police in a high speed chase.

Prema Benson almost hit a Panama City Police Officer working special detail for Ironman on South Thomas Drive.

He then jumped the curb and hit a fence before fleeing the scene.

Panama City and Panama City Beach Police Officers chased Benson down Thomas until the Bay County Sheriff's Office deployed spike strips by the Cypress Park business parking lot.

Benson then jumped one of the parking stops and reversed into a panama city beach police car.

He was arrested and is facing multiple charges including DUI, property damage, and attempting to elude a police officer.
