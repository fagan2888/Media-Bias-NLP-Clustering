Never mind whether we agree with them on any particular policy issue, they are simply no longer a serious organization.\n\nThat fact was underscored again this week and over the weekend, in light of the release of two different official reports, one from the U.S. State Department on the proposed Keystone XL Pipeline project and another from the Congressional Budget Office on the economic outlook in light of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nNever mind whether you agree with the Republican position on either of those two policies. The fact that the party feels it necessary to blatantly lie about what\u2019s in each of those reports, specifically with regard to \u201cjob creation,\u201d in order to advocate for their own policy positions, underscores yet again that these are simply not serious people are worth being taken seriously anymore \u2026\n\nKeystone XL Jobs Lie\n\nIf it receives approval from both the State Department and the White House, the proposed Keystone XL pipeline would ship dirty tar sands oil from Alberta, Canada, down to the Gulf of Mexico to be shipped overseas.\n\nAfter years of claims by Republicans that the proposed Keystone XL pipeline would \u201ccreate tens of thousands of jobs,\u201d we now have some hard numbers on that, at least from the U.S. State Department, if you choose to believe them.\n\nLast year, while pushing for the KXL, House Speaker John Boehner released a statement claiming that the pipeline \u201cwill create over 20,000 direct jobs and 100,000 indirect jobs.\u201d On Friday, as the State Department released its \u201cFinal Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement\u201d on the project, Boehner once again released a statement reiterating his previous claim that the pipeline would bring \u201cmore than 100,000 jobs.\u201d\n\nThe trouble is, that\u2019s not true. At least according to the actual State Department report, which was the occasion for Boehner\u2019s Friday statement.\n\nThe report is long and in many pieces, so, naturally, it\u2019d be too much to ask of the speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives or anybody in his office to actually read it before issuing a statement about it. Nonetheless, it comes with a reasonably brief Executive Summary [PDF] (just 44 pages) in which it speaks directly to the issue of jobs in relation to KXL.\n\nIn the section on \u201cEconomic Activity During Construction\u201d (page 26), the report estimates that \u201cConstruction spending would support a combined total of approximately 42,100 jobs throughout the United States for the up to 2-year construction period.\u201d\n\nThat sounds pretty good! Until one bothers to keep reading. \u201cA job consists of one position that is filled for one year. The term support means jobs ranging from new jobs (i.e., not previously existing) to the continuity of existing jobs in current or new locations.\u201d\n\nApproximately 16,100 of those temporary jobs would be \u201cdirect jobs at firms that are awarded contracts for goods and services, including construction\u201d and the rest, \u201capproximately 26,000,\u201d would be the result of \u201cindirect or induced spending.\u201d In other words, that would be \u201cgoods and services purchased by the construction contractors and spending by employees working for either the construction contractor or for any supplier of goods and services required in the construction process.\u201d\n\nSo, in addition to people who work for suppliers (where they may already be employed prior to the approval of KXL), people who work at restaurants or motels near the construction site or for any of the suppliers, also count as \u201cjobs\u201d in this estimate. For example, the report cites \u201cranchers providing beef for restaurants and construction camps.\u201d\n\nFair enough. Two years of jobs for those folks, many of whom will be able to continue working in the jobs they already have (so those jobs are not \u201ccreated,\u201d per se, by the construction of the pipeline.)\n\nAfter it\u2019s built, however, either one or two years later, according to the very next section of the Executive Summary titled \u201cEconomic Activity During Operations,\u201d the report states quite clearly [emphasis added]:\n\nOnce the proposed Project enters service, operations would require approximately 50 total employees in the United States: 35 permanent employees and 15 temporary contractors.\n\nThat\u2019s it. The Keystone XL Pipeline will offer 35 permanent jobs in the U.S. for the life of the pipeline, according to the U.S. State Department\u2019s final analysis.\n\nThat\u2019s a far cry from Boehner\u2019s claim on Friday, after the report came out, that KXL would bring \u201cmore than 100,000 jobs \u2026 with it.\u201d\n\nOf course, Boehner\u2019s hardly the only one in the Republican Party disingenuously making such unsupported claims about KXL. Last year, GOP Chairman Reince Priebus took to Facebook to claim that \u201cThe Keystone Pipeline would create thousands of jobs.\u201d Last week, he took to Twitter to claim that \u201c721,000 construction jobs have been lost, #Keystone remains unapproved.\u201d\n\nPerhaps Priebus was referring to something other than Keystone with that 721,000 number \u2014 it\u2019s unclear from his tweet \u2014 but if his message was unclear, that would be no accident. His quarter of a million followers on Twitter heard it loud and clear. He, like Boehner, was willing to lie to them in order to advocate for the pipeline \u2014 a pipeline that would result in 35 permanent American jobs.", "article_metadata": {"description": "From Obamacare to Keystone, here's why they're no longer a legitimate entity that deserves to be taken seriously VIDEO", "title": "R.I.P.
