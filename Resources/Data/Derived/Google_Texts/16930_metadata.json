Calvary Catholic Cemetery, but earlier records were incomplete. She looked up obituaries by conducting research through the Kansas State Historical Society, the Topeka and Shawnee County Public Library, and the Jackson County Historical Society\u2019s office.\n\nArnold, who retired from the Department of Veterans Affairs and whose husband, Merlin, was a career military serviceman, also was looking up veterans\u2019 information.\n\n\u201cI found this person who didn\u2019t have a stone and found that he was a veteran,\u201d she said.\n\nThe man, Daniel B. Marshall, who served as an Army sergeant in World War I, died March 30, 1931, in a soldier\u2019s home in Indiana at age 42. Arnold proceeded to complete the paperwork to get Marshall a military marker, but it wasn\u2019t until after she had done some research that she realized he was a cousin of her grandmother.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know that at the time I ordered the stone,\u201d she said.\n\nArnold said she hasn\u2019t found any additional information about Marshall\u2019s military service, and she has found very little about his life. He was divorced, and his remains were shipped from Indiana to his brother in Jackson County. He is buried with his parents and brothers, who she said all seem to have markers.\n\nShe isn\u2019t sure why his grave was never marked, but says it is possible the family couldn\u2019t afford it. Times were tough in 1931.\n\nBut 83 years and one day after Marshall died, he got his marker. Arnold said she is pleased with the way things turned out.\n\n\u201cIt made me feel even better to know that he was related,\u201d she said. \u201cI think my grandmother would be pleased that there was a stone there.\u201d\n\nSeveral of Arnold\u2019s family members are buried at Mt. Calvary, so when she visited the small cemetery in Duluth, in Pottawatomie County, and used its directory while doing genealogy work for a grandson who was traveling to Germany, she thought it would be nice to build a similar directory for Mt. Calvary. That was about a year ago, and she spent countless hours researching for it while her husband and others donated time and materials to build it.\n\nBecause of the Arnolds\u2019 military background \u2014 Merlin retired in 2003 as a chief master sergeant in the Kansas Air National Guard\u2019s 190th Air Refueling Wing \u2014 Judy also wanted to ensure veterans buried in the cemetery were recognized. She found that some Civil War veterans had no flag holders at their graves, and also looked for members of the VFW and American Legion\u2019s auxiliaries.\n\nShe found that, of the nearly 500 graves in the cemetery, 68 belonged to veterans. About 20 graves were missing flag holders. Those veterans\u2019 service ranged from the Civil War to Vietnam, she said.\n\nWhile the directory was completed in December, Arnold says she likely isn\u2019t finished with the project yet. There are still four unmarked graves in the cemetery that she hasn\u2019t been able to identify, and she is still looking for obituaries of others interred there.\n\nStill, she said she feels proud of her work.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a very rewarding project for me,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "News, Local, Samantha Foster", "og": {"site_name": "CJOnline.com", "description": "When Topekan Judy Arnold began researching to create a directory for Holton's Catholic cemetery, she had no idea it would lead her to a distant relative - a World War I veteran whose grave had never been marked with a headstone.", "title": "Topekan's research leads to discovery of WWI veteran's unmarked grave", "url": "http://cjonline.com/news/2014-05-25/topekans-research-leads-discovery-wwi-veterans-unmarked-grave", "image": "http://cjonline.com/sites/default/files/13388337.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "When Topekan Judy Arnold began researching to create a directory for Holton\u2019s Catholic cemetery, she had no idea it would lead her to a distant relative \u2014 a World War I veteran whose grave had never been marked with a headstone.Arnold obtained records from St. Dominic Catholic Church\u2019s cemetery board for Mt.
