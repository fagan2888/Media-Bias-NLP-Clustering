I\u2019m talking about the Hillary emails. The Hillary apology. The Hillary scandal blown up by a media that is obsessed with making 2016 Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton into a bad person. The former Secretary of State did apologize, for what we don\u2019t know, just days ago in a TV interview with Andrea Mitchell, who has been referred to as the Clinton hunter for decades.\n\nThe Hillary Clinton supporters that I talked to were outraged and angry. Why is she apologizing, they asked? I can\u2019t tell you how many people have approached me to ask me this question. Too many to count.\n\nThe only reason I could see was that the media was having another angry reaction to her lack of availability to them and her refusal to cower to their narratives \u2013 these are the same people who have been selling a conspiracy based on a book about her as if it were legitimate, when the author was a known conspiracy nut with an agenda and the book had no actual facts or evidence to substantiate the claims \u2013 and they were going to make damn sure she knew who was boss.\n\nSo we got the emails the emails the emails until no one could stand it anymore, and oh my gosh, the polls dropped! You don\u2019t say. Then the media said, look, your polls are dropping! You better talk to us about it. You need to apologize. In fact she was asked on August 4th during an NBC TV interview if she felt she needed to apologize.\n\nClinton was understandably taken aback. She must have been wondering if she was to apologize for the summer of fake email scandal coverage that the mainstream press had been living off of?\n\nNow that she apologized on TV last week and ate humble pie for the media, they say she might turn this thing around.\n\nInsert maniacal laughter here. Turn her pretty big chance especially with VP Joe Biden waiting in the wings to cancel out the Sanders influence, according to Nate Silver, to win the Democratic nomination around? Wow, I\u2019ll bet she\u2019s so relieved to hear that. Or could they be referring to her huge lead against many Republican contenders in their own home states? Or her huge win against them in a national poll?\n\nNo, they will say they were referring to the drop in her polls.\n\nYou know, the drop that came about because of the coverage they were doing over a non-issue.\n\nNow they say she apologized, but she did so reluctantly. You see, she likes to \u201cdig in\u201d, according to Maggie Haberman and Amy Chozick writing for New York Times. The way people do when they are right, perhaps. The authors have good reason for what they are writing \u2013 they say they interviewed many close Clinton inner circle people who were desperately trying to get Hillary to apologize but she just wouldn\u2019t. The problem is there is no context to how we got to Ground Zero in the Email Scandal that Never Existed.\n\nThere is no admission of the \u201clong-standing antipathy\u201d between the media and the Clintons, as Nate Silver put it, and the need for something to report on in what looked last spring to be a given for the Democratic candidate.\n\nThe emails are not an issue. The State Department has said that, the DoJ said it, Republicans have done the same thing and been less transparent about it, and all in all, the bottom line is voters don\u2019t care about emails. They didn\u2019t care when previous politicians took the computers and servers right out of the office.\n\nThey didn\u2019t care when they found out that 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney spent $100,000.00 in state funds to destroy all of his communications as Governor of Massachusetts. \u201c\u2026 11 of his top aides purchased their state-issued computer hard drives, and the Romney administration\u2019s e-mails were all wiped from a server, according to interviews and records obtained by the Globe\u2026 Andrea Saul, a spokeswoman for the Romney campaign, said the governor\u2019s aides did nothing wrong.\u201d\n\nDo any of you even remember this? It barely made a blip and no one asked him if he felt he needed to apologize. But it isn\u2019t that the issue doesn\u2019t matter- transparency matters. It\u2019s that voters do not care.\n\nSo this drop in the polls was due to the ongoing narrative that Hillary Clinton can\u2019t be trusted. She just has a way. I\u2019ve seen these comments over and over again \u2014 \u201cthe way she operates\u201d they say. When pushed for specifics, it\u2019s all crickets but for vague references to various debunked scandals.\n\nSo what we have here is a big pile of flaming desperation.\n\nWhat we have here is an Obamacare glitch redo. Remember? The press said you all didn\u2019t want affordable healthcare \u2013 it was ruined- because the roll-out had a glitch. Never mind that the glitch was no doubt in small part to the fact that Republicans found a way to throw the system into chaos. That was not made into an issue. The issue was that there was a \u201cglitch\u201d and it would destroy Obama, his plan, and the entire Democratic party. EVERYONE RUN! And many 2014 Democrats followed the media\u2019s advice to their own peril. The media also told us that Obama voters were over him in the lead up to 2012. It\u2019s as if they live in a different world.\n\nSo here we are, back at dissecting why Hillary Clinton\u2019s apology was so late for a scandal that didn\u2019t exist except due to the press\u2019s obsession with it.\n\nIt seems as if Clinton is being pushed by the same people who pushed her in 2007 to chase after something that isn\u2019t actually going anywhere. 2008 was mostly due to the Iraq vote and the fact that Obama was a once in a generation candidate, with the message the party supporters needed at the time, Kennedy charisma and incredible powers of oration. Obama was cool temperament at a time when the country was reeling from Bush\u2019s emotional, scattershot leadership. Clinton didn\u2019t do anything wrong then.\n\nThe former Senator and Secretary of State is not wrong now. She had nothing to apologize for and she doesn\u2019t need to cower to anyone. She has been the \u201cmost admired woman\u201d in the world pretty reliably for the last decade. She doesn\u2019t need to change herself or put on humble airs to appease the media. The people like the strong, independent, reliable, experienced and knowledgeable persona she projects. She is strong with Democrats (liberal Democrats might lean to Sanders but not as an anti-Clinton reaction, as we have pointed out before).\n\nShe can do what President Obama starting doing in his second term.\n\nGo around the media to get a message straight to the people. Yes, candidates need to be accessible to the press and they need to answer questions when they\u2019ve agreed to do so and they shouldn\u2019t avoid agreeing to do so for months or an entire campaign. But the media also has a responsibility to educate people and inform them, to vet stories. That\u2019s not what we see in our beltway media. It\u2019s hard to guard a henhouse when you\u2019re drinking with the hens every Friday.\n\nOnce again, we have a media more intent on proving their own importance and power than on vetting issues. Where is Jeb Bush\u2019s apology? Where is Mitt Romney\u2019s apology or the media asking him if he feels he needs to apologize? Oh, that\u2019s right, no one cares what they did with their emails.\n\nIn a perfect world, Clinton would bring on some of the Obama team that helped steady the boat in the rocky waters of media turmoil. It must be tough to face a constant barrage of \u201cyou need to apologize, or you\u2019re going to lose everything!\u201d from people who have the power to make nothing into something.\n\nBut I disagree with the media that her apology turned this around. It turned them around, but they are still sour on how she got there. This is like trying to date someone that just isn\u2019t into you.\n\nIt is my opinion that Hillary Clinton should take her bad self 100% in the opposite direction. These are new times. Democratic voters like her \u201cdigging in\u201d (aka, cool disdain) when she is wrongfully attacked. They trusted her more than most politicians for years. She earned that with her serious work and dedication. That is who she is. A bit square, a bit \u201ctoo\u201d serious. But it adds up to a person the public really trusts.\n\nClinton was the girl who studied really hard every night to get good grades. Now she\u2019s an enormously powerful woman who has met with world leaders as Secretary of State and as First Lady. She\u2019s been a Senator. She has undertaken each job, as she took her job as mother, with fierce dedication. That is who she is. What we get from Hillary Clinton is someone we grew up with, someone who has always been pushing for the middle class, someone who is loyal, reliable and tough. Not someone who apologizes for things that weren\u2019t wrong. Because to be honest, that apology came off as inauthentic and that is so much worse than a made up scandal. That will harm her brand more than any hyperventilating from Republicans and the press.\n\nSec. Clinton doesn\u2019t need to fix anything or be handled out of herself out of other people\u2019s fear.\n\nWhere is the media\u2019s apology to Hillary Clinton? Maybe the people don\u2019t want another decade of media bias against the Clintons. Maybe it\u2019s time to focus on the issue that actually matter to voters.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hillary Clinton apologized for a made up email scandal that was blown way out of proportion by the MSM.
