(T.J. Kirkpatrick/Getty Images)\n\nWith bold opinions and a witty and erudite writing style, Andrew Sullivan has long been one of the most important British imports among the American pundit class. He has also been a media pioneer, becoming a successful blogger before the term was widely known and an entrepreneur who tested the limits of \u201cbrand-name journalism\u201d by starting a personal for-profit Web site called the Dish.\n\nBut on Wednesday, Sullivan, 51, said that his experiment in free-standing, self-supporting journalism was coming to an end after two years. \u201cI want to let you know I\u2019ve decided to stop blogging,\u201d he wrote in a note posted on the Dish, adding that the end would come \u201cin the near future.\u201d\n\nAlong with a small staff in Washington, Sullivan, an omnivorous intellectual, made the Dish into a wide-ranging, and sometimes idiosyncratic, collection of news and commentary. His cosmopolitan eye ranged from the State of the Union to the progress of gay marriage across America (he was a fervent proponent) to marijuana legalization (also in favor). There are also copious contributions from readers, including such amusing ephemera as \u201clatrinalia,\u201d or bathroom graffiti.\n\nAt times, the site has been hyper-personal. Sullivan shared with his readers \u2014 \u201cover-shared\u201d as he put it in his note \u2014 not just his opinions on issues but details of his life, such as his marriage and his health struggles (he is HIV-positive). The site\u2019s mascot was Sullivan\u2019s beagle, Dusty, whose caricature appears in the masthead. Sullivan wrote about his beloved dog\u2019s life and death, too.\n\nBut the rigors of overseeing a nonstop stream of news and errata apparently took a toll. Sullivan said in his note that exhaustion played a role in his decision to quit. He noted that he has been blogging nearly continuously for the past 15 years \u2014 his blog had been part of Time, the Atlantic and the Daily Beast before he went out on his own in 2013.\n\nSullivan, who did not return requests for comment, has moved seamlessly from the old media to the new and back again over the arc of his career. He moved to the United States in 1984 and eventually served as editor of the New Republic for five occasionally tempestuous years, ending in 1996. He wrote books (\u201cThe Conservative Soul\u201d) and magazine articles and became a familiar TV commentator before starting his blog in 2000. A self-described conservative, he has nonetheless taken liberal positions on issues including gay marriage, the Affordable Care Act and government torture of terrorism suspects.\n\nIn announcing his decision to stop blogging, he wrote: \u201cI want to read again, slowly, carefully. I want to absorb a difficult book and walk around in my own thoughts with it for a while. I want to have an idea and let it slowly take shape, rather than be instantly blogged. I want to write long essays that can answer more deeply and subtly the many questions that the Dish years have presented to me. I want to write a book.\u201d\n\nHe also said, \u201cI want to spend some real time with my parents, while I still have them, with my husband, who is too often a \u2018blog-widow\u2019, my sister and brother, my niece and nephews, and rekindle the friendships that I have simply had to let wither because I\u2019m always tied to the blog.\u201d\n\nSullivan said he has had \u201cincreasing health challenges\u201d the past few years, although they are not related to his HIV-\u00adpositive status: \u201cMy doctor tells me they\u2019re simply a result of 15 years of daily, hourly, always-on-deadline stress. These past few weeks were particularly rough \u2014 and finally forced me to get real.\u201d\n\nSullivan\u2019s surprise announcement rippled across social media, with many, including fellow pundits, expressing shock and sadness at the news. Among others, New York Times columnist Ross Douthat, who has written that Sullivan may be remembered as the most influential political writer of his generation for his long advocacy of gay marriage, tweeted that it was \u201ctime to re-up my case\u201d for that accolade.\n\nAs with his site\u2019s content, Sullivan pursued a somewhat quirky business model for the Dish. Subscriptions were suggested, but not required, at $20 per year; many people paid more (subscriptions enabled readers to bypass a paywall and read longer stories). According to Sullivan\u2019s frequent self-disclosures, he had 30,478 paying customers as of two weeks ago, down from more than 34,000 last year. Revenue was just less than $1 million \u2014 about 10 percent more than a year ago. The site is approaching its annual renewal period, in which it loses and gains thousands of subscribers.\n\nSullivan\u2019s nonpaying audience was much larger, some 1 million unique visitors in December.\n\nSullivan rejected ads entirely, eschewing what surely would have been hundreds of thousands of dollars of additional revenue.\n\nAlthough the revenue figure grew in the two years that the Dish asked for subscriptions, it apparently has been barely enough to cover expenses. Sullivan has said he does not take a salary. However, there were no outward indications that the site was in financial trouble.\n\nIn his note, Sullivan gave no indication of when he would return as a writer, or whether the Dish would continue without him. But he has been known to change his mind, both on issues (he was for the invasion of Iraq but eventually recanted) and in his personal life (he moved to New York to run the Dish at one point but quickly returned to Washington).\n\nIn this case, however, he was uncharacteristically vague: \u201cI need to decompress and get healthy for a while,\u201d he wrote, \u201cbut I won\u2019t disappear as a writer.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Andrew Sullivan started blogging before blogging became the thing.
