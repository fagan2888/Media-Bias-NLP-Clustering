This is something that previous caucus winners know well. Even though former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum languished in the polls for most of the 2011, that didn\u2019t stop him from building meaningful relationships across the state.\n\nOne of the people Santorum created a strong bond with was State Representative Walt Rogers from Cedar Falls. Rogers was one of the first legislators to endorse Santorum in July of 2011. Rogers told TheIowaRepublican.com that he had received several inquiries from 2012 presidential candidates, but Santorum\u2019s personal touch made the difference.\n\n\u201cRick was the only one who came to my house, met my family and took a real interest in who I was as a legislator,\u201d Rogers told TheIowaRepublican.com. \u201cWe talked about family, faith, music, and issues. My kids loved him. I was impressed with his knowledge of issues, and his mature, practical way of governing.\u201d\n\nThe relationship that was formed almost four years ago is once again paying dividends for Santorum. Today Santorum will announce that Rogers has signed on to lead his Iowa efforts in advance of a 2016 presidential campaign. Rogers, an Assistant Majority Leader in the Iowa State House, will serve as Chairman of Patriot Voices in Iowa. Patriot Voices is the grassroots organization that Santorum formed following his 2012 president run.\n\nRogers believes he\u2019s a natural fit for Santorum. \u201cWe are very much alike as public servants, and he will work as hard as I will,\u201d Rogers explained. \u201cI will be actively working with his team on strategy, recruitment, Iowa contacts, issues and events. If I am fully on board something, I\u2019m a pretty good player/coach,\u201d Rogers added. Rogers explained that he will not be employed by Patriot Voices, but could potentially be in the future as the Iowa session winds down.\n\nPatriot Voices provided TheIowaRepublican.com the press release announcing Rogers over the weekend.\n\n\u201cI am excited to announce the addition of Walt Rogers to our growing Iowa team,\u201d Senator Santorum said. \u201cI am confident that his support today will again be a terrific lift for our efforts in the Hawkeye State.\u201d Santorum added, \u201cLike me, Walt understands the importance of not just being a Party of business-owners, but being a Party that fights for the worker and hard-working families. Our movement cannot win unless we recognize that the 90% of Americans who do not own their own business and the 70% of Americans who do not have a college degree need a champion. I am prepared to fight for them and I am thrilled to have Walt Rogers standing side-by-side with me in Iowa.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s obvious that relationships matter in states like Iowa, but it also helps when someone who signs on to work with a potential candidate is actually a natural fit. Rogers gives Santorum more than just a point of contact, he gives Santorum an Iowa point person who knows what caucus politics is all about. Rogers isn\u2019t the type of guy who\u2019s going to be touted in a press release and never heard from again. He\u2019s the type of guy who will pour ever thing he\u2019s got to help Santorum be successful.\n\nRogers also knows that Santorum will have to run a much different race in Iowa to be successful in 2016. \u201cRick won the Iowa caucus last time without spending much money,\u201d Rogers noted. \u201cThis time if he gets in, he will work harder, have a better team, be better funded, and have a better strategy.\u201d\n\nRogers also explained that Iowans don\u2019t care about poll numbers or who the 24-hour news networks are currently focused on. \u201cIowans want the best qualified, most experienced person to be their President. I\u2019m convinced Rick is that person.\u201d Rogers understands that Santorum will once again be outspent by other candidates just like he was in 2012, but he noted that Iowa has a history of weeding out candidates who are not ready for the scrutiny that a presidential campaign brings.\n\nSantorum\u2019s blue-collar conservatism helped him win a large numbers of rural counties across the state in 2012, but with the potential of a much larger field and candidates like Mike Huckabee, Ted Cruz, and a revitalized Rick Perry who could all cut into Santorum\u2019s base, Rogers and Santorum\u2019s Iowa team will need to better organize the state\u2019s larger communities. Rogers, who represents part of Black Hawk County, the state\u2019s fourth most populous county, should be able to help Santorum better sell his message in more metropolitan areas.\n\nSantorum finished third in Black Hawk County in 2012, Ron Paul and Mitt Romney edged Santorum by a little more than 100 votes. It\u2019s not that Santorum did poorly in the more urban counties in 2012 \u2013 he was actually surprisingly competitive all across the state. But for Santorum to be successful in 2016, he will need to find an urban stronghold to go with his strong rural strategy. With Rogers on-board and involved early, Black Hawk County looks like an obvious place to start.\n\nBelow is the release that Patriot Voices will be sending out to announce Rogers:", "article_metadata": {}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda2f1\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI am excited to announce the addition of Walt Rogers to our growing Iowa team,\u201d Senator Santorum said.\nRogers, an Assistant Majority Leader in the Iowa State House, will serve as Chairman of Patriot Voices in Iowa.\nRogers gives Santorum more than just a point of contact, he gives Santorum an Iowa point person who knows what caucus politics is all about.\nOne of the people Santorum created a strong bond with was State Representative Walt Rogers from Cedar Falls.\nToday Santorum will announce that Rogers has signed on to lead his Iowa efforts in advance of a 2016 presidential campaign."}
