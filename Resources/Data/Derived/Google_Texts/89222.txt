Charles Krauthammer had harsh words for the Obama Administration Wednesday evening over the dismal state of the economy following a newly revised report by the Commerce Department. The Department corrected its estimates of first-quarter gross domestic product Wednesday and revealed that that economy contracted at a 2.9 percent annual rate.

“The administration can come up with all the excuses it wants,” Krauthammer told the Fox News “Special Report” panel.

He continued, “In the first term, the administration would blame everything on Bush, now it’s on climate…This is obviously a result of an administration’s five years of policy which are high taxation, high regulation, high spending, and high debt.”
