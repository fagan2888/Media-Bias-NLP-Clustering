Even before state legislators mangled the public school pension system in 2001 by vastly escalating benefits while deferring payments, runaway employee health care costs posed a huge challenge.

While presiding over the unfolding pension disaster, lawmakers also have ignored the health care cost problem, even though the state government could play a constructive role.

State Rep. Sid Michaels Kavulich, a Lackawanna County Democrat, is cosponsor of a bill that would take a halting step toward producing some cost savings for school districts. But, unfortunately, it does not go far enough.

The bill would create a statewide board to study consolidating 500 school district health care plans into a statewide plan or a group of regional plans. But the Legislative Budget and Finance Committee, a joint committee of House and Senate members, already has concluded that a consolidated statewide health care plan for school district employees would save at least $200 million a year by 2020. In 2015, taxpayers paid more than $2.6 billion for school employee coverage.

Such a plan would vastly expand the risk pool, create fierce competition among health care insurers that could reduce prices, and vastly reduce the redundant administrative costs inherent in 500 plans.

At a recent legislative hearing a school administrator objected that a statewide plan could diminish cost savings that some districts have achieved with their teachers unions. But those cases are a tiny minority; in Pennsylvania benefits for teachers most often are far greater than in the private sector, and full coverage at public expense is common.

Under the Affordable Care Actâ€™s definition of plan benefits, the highest is platinum-plus. The Budget and Finance Committee found in 2015 that coverage for 71 percent of school employees is in that category, whereas only 8 percent of average taxpayers have that level.

Creation of a statewide board would, in effect, delay reform for at least several more years. Rather than launching that ponderous process, lawmakers simply should commission a study from a consult. Or, as costs continue to mount, lawmakers should accept the findings of the Budget and Finance Committee and aggressively move to realize the projected savings through a consolidated health care plan.
