They\u2019re told it has all the nutrients they need to stay alive and, spoiler alert, the bricks end up being made from bugs. As disgusting as that sounds, a new study suggests that Hollywood got this one right \u2014 bugs may be more nutritious than steaks.\n\nResearchers from the University of Oxford pitted insects against main meat sources in America, like chicken, steak, and pork to see which one was actually more nutritious. Published in Nature, the study used two models to help them arrive at a conclusion: Ofcom and Nutrient Value Scores (NVS). Ofcom uses a scoring system that takes a 100-gram sample of a particular food and tallies up the amount of energy, sodium, saturated fat, and sugars that are in the sample on a scale of 1 to 100. The closer the total score is to 100, the more nutritious that food is. The NVS works similarly, but focuses more on the sample\u2019s amount of protein, energy, and fat levels, as well as its vitamin and calcium levels.\n\nWhen comparing crickets, honey bees, silkworms, mealworms, mopane caterpillars, and palm weevil larvae against chicken, beef, pork, and their respective offals, the Ofcom scores were all relatively the same. But when they used the NVS together with Ofcom, every single insect the researchers examined came out on top.\n\nThe researchers concluded that none of the insects were found to be any less healthy than the meats. However, they also found that the whole category of insects \u201ccontains some foods that could potentially exacerbate diet-related public health problems related to overnutrition, but may be effective in combating undernutrition.\u201d\n\nAs much as we all love eating livestock, the process of growing and maintaining them is a damaging, costly, and slow process. Insects, on the other hand, only take a few days to mature, and the cost of maintaining them is relatively small. That being said, unless we live in a world like the one in Snowpiercer, it\u2019ll be a while before the general public accepts a plate of bugs as their next meal.\n\nSource: Payne C, et al.
