Regarding the April 21 front-page article “Court lets terrorism survivors get assets”:

Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. dissented in the case Bank Markazi v. Peterson because, as he stated, the six-judge opinion in favor of Deborah Peterson allows the legislative branch to impinge on the judicial power of the courts. This dissenting view might have been more credible had his record with the Affordable Care Act been different and more balanced. Mr. Roberts seemed to have no problem when the judicial branch impinged on the legislative branch in 2012 and 2015 as he rewrote the ACA to keep it from being declared unconstitutional by the court as written by the legislative branch.

Mr. Roberts seems to have grave concerns with the legislative branch stepping on the powers of the judicial branch but does not have the same concerns when the judicial branch rewrites laws for the legislative branch. This is an interesting thought process at best.
