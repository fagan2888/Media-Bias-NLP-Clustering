Always have been, always will be. Which is why Curious Theatre Company didn\u2019t even think of featuring one without the other at the 10th edition of its signature fundraiser, Denver Stories.\n\nDenver\u2019s first African-American mayor and his wife of 44 years were lovingly portrayed by Keith Carlton Smith and Jada Suzanne Dixon in \u201cOne Degree of Separation: The Esteemed Legacies of Wilma and Wellington Webb.\u201d\n\nThe one-act, one-performance-only play was written by Josh Hartwell and directed by Christy Montour-Larson.\n\nIt covered a lot of ground, from first marriages to Wellington Webb\u2019s distinguished career as a public servant. Before he was mayor, Wellington Webb was a teacher, mental health worker, university professor, federal administrator, state regulator, state legislator and city auditor.\n\nWilma Webb served 13 years in the Colorado legislature, during which time she successfully pushed to make Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s birthday a state holiday and introduced legislation to prevent discrimination based on sexual orientation. Later, she was appointed to a post in the U.S. Department of Labor by then-President Bill Clinton, chaired the Mayor\u2019s Commission on Art, Culture and Film and worked on behalf of programs that focused on young people, families and drug abuse prevention.\n\nThe production also included cameo appearances by several of those close to the Webbs: attorney Penfield Tate III, Andrew Hudson, Paula Herzmark, Mike Dino and Fabby Hillyard.\n\nJeremy Shamos, chairman of the Curious Theatre board, chaired Denver Stories with Herzmark, Hudson and David McReynolds.\n\n\u201cIt is a great honor to have our lives celebrated by Curious Theatre Company,\u201d the Webbs said in a statement afterward. \u201cSometimes it is hard to believe how much opportunity and support we\u2019ve enjoyed and we are hopeful that our accomplishments in public service are an inspiration to others.\u201d\n\nThe event began with a cocktail reception in a tent decorated to reflect the contributions of the honorees. BJ Dyer and his team from Bouquets mounted enhanced images of downtown buildings, public art and landscapes. As an homage to Wellington Webb\u2019s habit of walking the campaign trail in tennis shoes, one table was decorated with an oversize shoe filled with flowers.\n\nFood, from Occasions Catering, featured such Wilma Webb favorites as crab croquettes, corn pudding and sweet potato chips.\n\nThe 170 guests received souvenir campaign buttons that had a 1970s-era photo of the couple. There also was music by Hazel Miller.\n\nChip Walton, the co-founder and producing artistic director of Curious Theatre, and his wife, Dee Covington, welcomed a crowd that included attorney Steve Farber; Arts and Venues director Kent Rice; Mi Casa Resource Center president Christine Marquez-Hudson; Denver City Councilwoman Jeanne Robb; Tyrone and Mary Holt; Moses and Gwen Brewer; Barbara Bridges; Dan Ritchie and Joy Burns; Judi Wolf; Merle Chambers; Dick and Marcia Robinson; Sandra Roberts-Taylor; and Sharon and Lanny Martin.\n\nJoanne Davidson: 303-809-1314, jdavidson@denverpost.com or twitter.com/joannedavidson\n\nBanner year for the links\n\nJune and Dr. Johnny Johnson host a dinner-dance at Cherry Hills Country Club to celebrate the end of a successful year for the Denver chapter of The Links Inc.
