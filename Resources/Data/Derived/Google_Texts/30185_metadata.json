It\u2019s dumbfounding considering that history teaches us artists are often the first to be silenced by totalitarian governments.\n\nSinise and Mantegna are two midwesterners who grew up with an understanding of the sacrifices members of our military have made to keep our nation free.\n\nI had the honor of interviewing both of these patriots this week about the Memorial Day concert scheduled for Sunday night. The concert draws hundreds of thousands to the mall and it is free to the public.\n\nI asked Sinise about his special connection to the troops and he said it really all started with his iconic performance as Lt. Dan in the film Forrest Gump. He has now started a foundation specifically designed to help wounded veterans, especially amputees.\n\n\u201cWe have a whole new generation of Lt. Dan\u2019s out there and we\u2019ll highlight one of them at the concert this weekend,\u201d he told me.\n\nSinese has said that his appreciation for Memorial Day goes back to his childhood in Illinois: \u201cWhen I was a kid, I loved the Memorial Day parade. Especially saluting the soldiers who had done so much for our country. I was too young to understand the words \u2018sacrifice\u2019 and \u2018tribute,\u2019 but I knew what a hero was. And that\u2019s what our service members have always been to me.\u201d\n\nMantegna also grew up in Chicago; having military members in his family instilled a special appreciation for those who have sacrificed for our country:\n\n\u201cI had a lot of military in my family and they all came back from conflicts so there was no immediate attachment to Memorial Day in terms of a day of personal remembrance,\u201d Mantegna said. \u201cAnd yet, once I did that concert I realized Memorial Day is not just a holiday, it\u2019s our most important holiday because of the sacrifices all these men and women made throughout our history.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s plenty to complain about when it comes to some of the bone-headed, unpatriotic utterances from many of the members of the Hollywood community. But here are two examples of humble men who understand what it means to be truly free, and, sadly, what the cost of that freedom has been.\n\nI know from personal experience there are more men and women like this in Hollywood. They just don\u2019t get the attention they deserve.\n\nBY: Larry O\u2019Connor/published with permission from WFB", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "BizPac Review", "description": "Gary Sinise and Joe Mantegna, two of Hollywood\u2019s biggest patriots, are in Washington, D.C., to host the 25th annual Memorial Day concert on the west lawn of the Capitol.
