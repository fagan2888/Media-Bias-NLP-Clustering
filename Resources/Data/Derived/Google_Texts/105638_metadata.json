People are interested in knowing more about a celebrity than just their professional accomplishments.\u201d\n\nSocial media have become a conduit of information in an area that was once taboo: Athletes\u2019 health.\n\nTeams still try to hide players\u2019 injuries like they\u2019re guarding state secrets, but now the athletes are freely providing information on their own.\n\nKobe Bryant, Alex Rodriguez, Bryce Harper and Mark Teixeira are among the athletes who have posted updates on their surgeries or rehabilitation.\n\nMost of the posts are superficial.\n\nVan Dyken-Rouen seems to have taken it to a new, open-book level.\n\nThe six-time Olympic gold medalist was involved in an all-terrain vehicle accident on June 6, severing her spine and leaving her with no feeling in her legs.\n\nA day after surgery, Van Dyken-Rouen posted photos on Instagram of her family in the hospital room and a drawing from her niece and nephew.\n\nThe next day, she posted a selfie in her hospital bed and later put up a shot of her sitting up for the first time. She even posted images of her X-rays; one showing her dislocated vertebrae, another of the pins and rods holding her spine together after surgery.\n\nVan Dyken-Rouen continued to be active on social media throughout her stay in intensive care and after she moved to a Colorado hospital to continue rehab.\n\nThe striking part about Van Dyken-Rouen\u2019s posts are they\u2019re just as open, positive and sarcastic as before her injury:\n\n\u2014 Just thinking out loud..Now I will get really good seats at @dbacks and other favorite sports teams. #awesome #bringMyOwnChair #goodParking2\n\n\u2014 Was in MRI until 4:00am today (started at 11:30pm) did whole spine and brain, and so far, so good. Yes, I have a brain! LOL #BabySteps\n\n\u2014 Happy Friday! No more surgeries for this girl, so I celebrate with Froot Loops\u2026 SHHH, don\u2019t tell!.\n\n\u2014 Well this is about a week late for me (with a photo of a TV story about national ATV safety week).\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s doing it in such a positive and upbeat way, it\u2019s almost breathtaking how inspiring it is,\u201d said William Ward, professor of social media at Newhouse School at Syracuse University.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if most people are that upbeat on any given day much less after going through something that traumatic, but here she within days of it is talking and interacting, really doing it in an upbeat way, inspiring people.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s been a two-way street.\n\nBefore social media, well wishes came in the form of notes and cards, maybe signs outside the hospital.\n\nNow, athletes and celebrities not only get instant messages from their family and friends, they can interact with them, adding another layer to their therapy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s blowing me away. It truly is,\u201d Van Dyken-Rouen said before boarding a medical flight to Colorado last week. \u201cI\u2019ve gotten a lot of messages sending me thoughts, prayers, positive vibes. I feel them. It\u2019s helping me and I just want to say thank you to everyone.\u201d\n\nAnd she has \u2014 on social media of course.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Amy Van Dyken-Rouen staying positive on social media", "title": "Amy Van Dyken-Rouen staying positive on social media", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/06/27/amy-van-dyken-rouen-staying-positive-on-social-media/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140624__vandyken-poolp1-1.jpg", "height": 392}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140624__vandyken-poolp1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-27T06:30:36+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T10:18:52+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd20bc\"", "article_summary": "It\u2019s helping me and I just want to say thank you to everyone.\u201dAnd she has \u2014 on social media of course.\nIt truly is,\u201d Van Dyken-Rouen said before boarding a medical flight to Colorado last week.\nVan Dyken-Rouen continued to be active on social media throughout her stay in intensive care and after she moved to a Colorado hospital to continue rehab.\nVan Dyken-Rouen seems to have taken it to a new, open-book level.\nA day after surgery, Van Dyken-Rouen posted photos on Instagram of her family in the hospital room and a drawing from her niece and nephew."}
