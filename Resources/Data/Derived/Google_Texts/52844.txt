Blame it on an economy still on the mend or go so far as to credit Obamacare. Either way, there's fresh evidence of a slowing in health inflation in the latest survey of employers by Towers Watson and the National Business Group for Health.



The survey also affirmed a trend abundantly familiar to a growing number of working Americans: cost-sharing is on the rise.

The cost of providing employer-sponsored health care benefits, according to the survey, is expected to increase 4.4 percent this year, climbing to $9,560 per employee compared to last year's $9,157.
