It noted that not only are the AiG \"industrial-development bonds\u2026considered the riskiest municipal debt, but because the city \"issued the bonds without a rating\u2026prospect of repayment [are] even less clear.\"\n\nThe report also states that offering documents \"cite at least 39 risks to buyers, including that AiG has no obligation to back the debt. Bondholders' sole revenue stream would come from money spent by visitors.\"\n\nShould AiG receive sufficient funds to move forward with the project, construction is scheduled to begin in March.\n\nIn August 2013, AiG informed supporters that it changed its theme park funding structure due to Obamacare.\n\n\"In large part, because of AiG's strong biblical stand against the Obamacare legislation's mandated coverage of abortion-causing drugs, AiG pursued a change in the Ark Encounter funding structure that now includes a bond investment opportunity for you to consider,\" Ham wrote.\n\nAiG teaches that the Earth is only 6,000 years old. Its offices and a museum promulgating its views on the origin of the universe are located in Hebron and Petersburg, Ky., respectively.", "article_metadata": {"Description": "Plans to build the Answers in Genesis theme park might not stay afloat unless the nonprofit can raise $29 million from investors by Feb. 6.", "Copyright": "2016 Christian Post", "Title": "Answers in Genesis Blames 'Spiritual Battle' for Theme Park's Financial Woes", "og": {"site_name": "Christian Post", "description": "Plans to build the Answers in Genesis theme park might not stay afloat unless the nonprofit can raise $29 million from investors by Feb. 6.", "title": "Answers in Genesis Blames 'Spiritual Battle' for Theme Park's Financial Woes", "url": "http://www.christianpost.com/news/answers-in-genesis-blames-spiritual-battle-for-theme-parks-financial-woes-112134/", "image": "http://images.christianpost.com/full/51104/ark-encounter.jpg", "author": "Morgan Lee", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ChristianPost", "image": "http://images.christianpost.com/full/51104/ark-encounter.jpg", "description": "Plans to build the Answers in Genesis theme park might not stay afloat unless the nonprofit can raise $29 million from investors by Feb. 6.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Answers in Genesis Blames 'Spiritual Battle' for Theme Park's Financial Woes"}, "syndication-source": "http://www.christianpost.com/news/answers-in-genesis-blames-spiritual-battle-for-theme-parks-financial-woes-112134/", "robots": "index, follow", "bt": {"keywords": "answers,genesis,blames,spiritual,battle,theme,parks,financial,woes,christian&20news,christianity,evangelical", "pubDate": "2014-01-07T13:14:09-05:00", "modDate": "2014-01-07T13:14:09-05:00"}, "msvalidate.01": "29BD7F6D752EB52F5F8F8ACEF4AC6689", "fb": {"page_id": 41093998634, "app_id": 968308226558745}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "Googlebot-news": "index, follow", "Keywords": "answers,genesis,blames,spiritual,battle,theme,parks,financial,woes,christian news,christianity,evangelical", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd40fe\"", "article_summary": "\"Please be aware that the associated complications and struggles have been beyond our control,\" wrote Ham.\n, Christian Post Reporter By Morgan Lee Christian Post Reporter(Photo: Creation Museum)In a recent fundraising letter, Answers in Genesis (AiG) President Ken Ham claimed that the organization's theme park's current financial woes were \"an indication of the immense spiritual battle we are in.\"\nIn August 2013, AiG informed supporters that it changed its theme park funding structure due to Obamacare.\nHam explained the budget shortfall in a recent email to donors and asked the community for financial assistance.\n\"As you have read in some of my prior emails, many challenges and road blocks came up as we worked through the stages of the bond offering and the first closing,\" wrote Ham."}
