U.S. Sens. Robert Menendez and Cory Booker, both D-N.J., announced Wednesday a combined $814,648 in federal Assistance to Firefighter Grants (AFG) to improve safety and operations in Helmetta, Haddon Township, Brigantine, Galloway Township and Teaneck.

The AFG program is administered by the Department of Homeland Security’s Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).

“These grants will allow our fire departments to operate more efficiently and ensure our firefighters are properly equipped to protect themselves and keep residents safe,” Menendez said. “We must do everything we can to ensure our first responders have the tools necessary to protect our communities on a daily basis.”

“The brave men and women serving in fire departments all across New Jersey should have the necessary equipment and training to best protect themselves and serve our communities,” Booker said. “This funding is essential to helping fire departments protect their firefighters and I will continue to work to bring these critical funds back to our state.”

The following grants were awarded: $325,905 to Haddon Township Fire District No. 1; $268,096 to City of Brigantine Fire Department; $94,286 to Cologne Volunteer Fire Company (Galloway Township); $61,819 to Teaneck Volunteer Ambulance Corps; $46,858 to Helmetta Fire Department; $17,684 to Pomona Volunteer Fire Assoc. No. 3 (Galloway Township).

The AFG program provides funding to enhance response capabilities, as well as to more effectively protect the health and safety of the public and emergency response personnel.
