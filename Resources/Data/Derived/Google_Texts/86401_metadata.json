We had like three or four more innings left of baseball. It\u2019s not over until it\u2019s over.\u201d\n\nThe Eagles were powered by the big bat of cleanup hitter Konner Ambrose who was 2 for 3 with four RBIs including a three-run homer in the fifth.\n\nEarly on, this game was tight as both teams traded runs like punches for a 3-2 CA lead after four innings until Summertown\u2019s haymaker of six runs in the fifth that put the Bulldogs in a hole that they could not climb out of.\n\n\u201cA couple of innings we had bases loaded and couldn\u2019t get them in,\u201d McCall said. \u201cWe have just got to execute that. The main part was we left too many runners on. We have got to get those in.\u201d\n\nColumbia Academy had went up 1-0 in the bottom of the first thanks to an RBI single by Regan Chaney that scored the Bulldogs\u2019 starting pitcher Scott Lentz.\n\nThe Eagles would tie the game in the top of the second for a 1-1 score.\n\nThe top of the third inning also proved fruitful for Summertown who took the 2-1 lead when Ambrose knocked in leadoff hitter and pitcher Bryce Giles with a two-out RBI single.\n\nCA was quick to answer in the bottom half of the third however, as the Bulldogs tallied a run to knot game at 2-2 when catcher Noah Brock came in to score when the ball escaped the reach of the Eagle catcher.\n\nA throwing error by Summertown\u2019s third baseman allowed Lentz to reach with two outs and for McCall to score after doubling to lead off the frame.\n\nThe Bulldogs were up 3-2 after four complete and appeared in control of the game.\n\nThe three-run blast to right field by Ambrose and a two-run shot by Bailey Burleson in the fifth inning would swing the pendulum Summertown\u2019s direction though for an emphatic 8-3 advantage.\n\nColumbia Academy had to get to work if the Bulldogs wanted to overcome this sizable deficit.\n\nA pair of RBI singles by Billy Thurman and McCall in the bottom of the fifth cut into the Eagles\u2019 commanding lead for a 8-5 score.\n\nIn the latter innings of the game, the Bulldogs would continue to threaten, sending the tying run to the plate in the sixth and seventh innings but strikeouts would negate a shot at completing a rally.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t be mad because they competed to the end,\u201d CA head coach Richie Estep said. \u201cThat\u2019s just how the game goes. You have got to put the bat on the ball in situations. At least make them do the work and not go down with strikeouts.\u201d\n\nColumbia Academy has two more games left in the regular season starting with a Monday matchup at Spring Hill at 6 p.m. followed with a home game against Grace Christian Academy on Tuesday at 6:30 p.m.\n\nThese games hold a measure of importance for CA in order to stay sharp with the district tourney looming on Friday.\n\n\u201cJust to stay fresh,\u201d Estep said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to sit a week and play the district tournament. Especially at the plate, you can get off at the plate real easy.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Columbia Academy (20-9) could not overcome a six-run fifth inning by Summertown (20-9) falling 8-5 Saturday at home.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "CALEB ODOM codom@c-dh.net", "og": {"site_name": "Columbia Daily Herald", "description": "Columbia Academy (20-9) could not overcome a six-run fifth inning by Summertown (20-9) falling 8-5 Saturday at home.", "title": "Bulldogs fall to Summertown but don\u2019t quit", "url": "http://columbiadailyherald.com/sports/preps/bulldogs-fall-summertown-don-t-quit", "image": "http://columbiadailyherald.com/sites/columbiadailyherald.com/files/field/media/web1_McCall-tag-by-rob.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://columbiadailyherald.com/sports/preps/bulldogs-fall-summertown-don-t-quit", "title": "Bulldogs fall to Summertown but don\u2019t quit", "card": "summary", "creator": "@thedailyherald"}, "al": {"web": {"should_fallback": "true"}, "android": {"url": "columbiadailyherald://?eid=1184445", "app_name": "columbiadailyherald", "package": "com.stephensmedia.columbiadailyherald"}, "ios": {"url": "columbiadailyherald://?eid=1184445", "app_store_id": 964773799, "app_name": "columbiadailyherald"}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=964773799", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.stephensmedia.columbiadailyherald", "keywords": "Preps,Local,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-25T22:10:30-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=0.9"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd03b9\"", "article_summary": "Columbia Academy (20-9) could not overcome a six-run fifth inning by Summertown (20-9) falling 8-5 Saturday at home.\nColumbia Academy had to get to work if the Bulldogs wanted to overcome this sizable deficit.\nThe Bulldogs were up 3-2 after four complete and appeared in control of the game.\nA pair of home runs by the Eagles in the top of the fifth would be enough for Summertown to hold off CA who fought till the bitter end.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to sit a week and play the district tournament."}
