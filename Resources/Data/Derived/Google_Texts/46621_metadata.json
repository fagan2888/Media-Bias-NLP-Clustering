Now there\u2019s scientific evidence to show how this can be done.\n\nReducing hospital readmissions was a focus of the the Affordable Care Act, and Kevin Erickson, MD, an instructor in nephrology at Stanford, decided to study a group of patients who are often hospitalized. He and his colleagues examined whether an additional doctor\u2019s visit in the month after hospital discharge would help keep kidney-failure patients on dialysis from being readmitted. He and his colleagues analyzed data collected between 2004-2009 by the United States Renal Data System, a national registry of nearly all end-stage renal disease patients in the country.\n\nIt\u2019s nice to find something that may generate both cost savings and better health outcomes\n\nResults showed that there was a significant reduction in hospital readmissions with that extra doctor\u2019s visit in the month after hospital discharge. And while the percentage doesn\u2019t sound all that significant \u2013 3.5 percent \u2013 in real numbers that translates to 31,370 fewer hospitalizations and $240 million per year saved, according to the study published this month in the Journal of the American Society of Nephrology.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice to find something that may generate both cost savings and better health outcomes,\u201d Erickson told me. \u201cPatients with end-stage renal disease suffer from poor quality of life. Some of that I suspect is related to multiple trips in and out of the hospital.\u201d\n\nPatients with kidney failure are at a particularly high risk of hospital readmission: In 2009 patients getting dialysis were admitted to the hospital nearly two times per year, 36 percent of whom were rehospitalized within 30 days, according to the study.\n\nPreviously: Study shows higher Medicaid coverage leads to lower kidney failure rates; Study shows higher rates of untreated kidney failure among older adults; Study shows daily dialysis may boost patients\u2019 heart function, physical health.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "kidney failure,dialysis,hospital readmissions,kidney patients", "og": {"image": "http://scopeblog.stanford.edu/wp-content/themes/scope/images/logo_share.jpg"}, "description": "Keeping kidney patients healthy enough to stay out of the hospital certainly sounds like a good thing - both for the patients and the economy.
