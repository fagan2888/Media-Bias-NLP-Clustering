A large and growing industry is trying to solve your problem and make sure you no longer have to count sheep. All you need is a smartphone, an open mind \u2013 and about $100 bucks.\n\nThe National Sleep Foundation says that anywhere from 50 million to 70 million Americans suffer from sleep disorders at some point in their lives, affecting not just their day-to-day functioning but also their health and longevity. While drugs have often been the fix of choice for many people with sleep problems like insomnia, increasingly the industry is offering tech-based sleep-monitoring products for consumers.\n\nRelated: The Power of Positive Sleep Persuasion\n\nInterest in such products is strong: The European and U.S. market for sleep disorder diagnostic devices is estimated to reach $125.8 million in revenue in 2017, up from $95.6 million last year, according to Frost & Sullivan, a research firm.\n\nOne of the latest sleep-tracking devices is Sense, an IOS-compatible system that tracks your sleep behavior, monitors the environment of your bedroom, including noise and light, and finds the most appropriate time to wake you up based on your personal sleep cycle. The primary device is a \u201cpolycarbonate orb\u201d that collects your personal data, MacRumors reports.\n\nWhen you wake up, Sense provides you with a full report of your nighttime sleep behavior via your smartphone and a mobile app. It includes how well you slept and how much disruption came from external sources, whether it was a car alarm or your partner\u2019s snoring.\n\nRelated: 10 Ways Sleep Is Now Big Business\n\nSense also comes with a small device that you clip onto your pillow to track your nighttime sleep habits. The larger device sits on your nightstand.\n\nJudging simply by its Kickstarter campaign, the product \u2013 which doesn\u2019t ship until November \u2013 is already in big demand. As of Monday, it had raised $1.09 million, largely surpassing its $100,000 goal with still 24 days to go. Sense is available through the Kickstarter website for $99 (regular pre-orders will cost $129 afterward).\n\nSense is not the only sleep monitoring device out there. Here are three other popular competitors:\n\nBeddit is a sensor you attach to your bed to track your sleep quality, heart rate and breathing. An app also coaches you on how to improve your sleep.
