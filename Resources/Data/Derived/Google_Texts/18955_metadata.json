By forcing Carteret out of their network, Blue Cross will also force its members to face long drive times, spend more time from work, and use unfamiliar facilities to get the care they could easily receive here in Morehead City. All while their premiums remain at the same high cost.\u201d\n\nMs. Lee stated that hospital officials are \u201cworking as diligently as we can to make this a smooth transition for Blue Cross customers.\u201d\n\nShe said the hospital\u2019s board of directors is looking at policies to help the transition, since it knows there is a strong possibility the hospital will be out of network in just over a month\u2019s time.\n\nVice President of Human Resources, Beth Beswick, said they are going to encourage all Blue Cross customers to talk to their physicians about how to handle their care moving forward, and that will be a key aspect of managing the changes.\n\n\u201cIt will be important that members communicate with their physicians, since they will drive that process,\u201d she said. Ms. Beswick noted that continuation of care for some patients may be able to move forward as planned, such as for radiation therapy patients.\n\nMs. Lee said the hospital will use all forms of communication to reach Blue Cross Blue Shield customers about the change.\n\nThose with questions about how the transition out of network may affect their health care costs can call the hospital at 808-6614 or visit its website, www.carterethealth.org.\n\nThe hospital\u2019s board of directors will meet in a closed session Friday morning to discuss hospital policies and how to best handle the transition away from Blue Cross Blue Shield\u2019s network.\n\nAccording to a press release, \u201cThe hospital is working on a hospital policy to mitigate some of the financial burden related to out-of-network expenses and will share this information very shortly.\u201d\n\nThe release also reminded patients that the hospital will still be in network through January.\n\nContact Anna Harvey at 252-726-7081, ext. 229; email anna@thenewstimes.com; or follow on Twitter @annaccnt.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Carolina Coast Online", "description": "Update: This article was updated at 1 p.m. to reflect that emergency care will still be considered in-network at Carteret Health Care, even if a new contract is not reached.", "title": "Carteret Health Care anticipates leaving BCBS network", "url": "http://www.carolinacoastonline.com/news_times/article_087ae0d6-a417-11e5-b3ba-1fdd8ee6bcac.html", "image": "http://www.carolinacoastonline.com/content/tncms/live/global/resources/images/_site/facebook_share_img-2.JPG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@tweetmeme", "card": "summary"}, "description": "Update: This article was updated at 1 p.m. to reflect that emergency care will still be considered in-network at Carteret Health Care, even if a new contract is not reached.", "keywords": "carteret health care,blue cross blue shield,out of network,contract,news_times,news", "news_keywords": "carteret health care,blue cross blue shield,out of network,contract,news_times,news"}, "article_summary": "Ms. Lee said the hospital will use all forms of communication to reach Blue Cross Blue Shield customers about the change.\nMs. Lee said if there is no change before the end of January, the hospital will move forward without being in the Blue Cross Blue Shield network.\nUpdate: This article was updated at 1 p.m. to reflect that emergency care will still be considered in-network at Carteret Health Care, even if a new contract is not reached.\nMOREHEAD CITY \u2014 Carteret Health Care officials have told the News-Times they are actively preparing to go out of the Blue Cross Blue Shield network in February, after the hospital failed to reach an agreement at a meeting earlier this week with the insurer.\nThose with questions about how the transition out of network may affect their health care costs can call the hospital at 808-6614 or visit its website, www.carterethealth.org."}
