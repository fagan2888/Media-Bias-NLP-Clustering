Health insurance options and expenditures are a real concern for agribusiness owners and it\u2019s hard to know what options will best fit the needs of your operation. Rest assured there are options; some that can even put money back your pocket.\n\nHealth Reimbursement Arrangements (HRAs) are based upon Section 105 of the Internal Revenue Code. These particular arraignments allow farmers who qualify to deduct 100% of family medical cost against the farm income. In turn, the taxpayer saves federal, state and FICA taxes for family medical costs (typically a 35% savings).\n\nThis is done by declaring medical expenses as business expenses, not as Schedule A itemized personal deductions, which are often limited or lost. What\u2019s the catch here you ask? Whether they file as sole proprietor or an LLC, farmers must have a spouse who is employed by their business, at least on a part-time basis. More and more farmers are putting their spouse on the payroll in order to take advantage of HRAs.\n\nA Section 4 105 Plan allows a qualified farmer to benefit by deducting 100% of:\n\nHealth Insurance and dental insurance premiums for eligible employee(s) and family. This also includes qualified long-term care insurance.\n\nUninsured (out of pocket) medical, dental and vision care expenses for eligible employee(s) and family.\n\nChiropractic, medical supplies, contact lenses, hearing aids, Medicare Part A, Medicare Supplemental, optical/vision, and cancer insurance premiums for eligible employee(s).\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at scenario that would qualify: Joe owns and runs a farm. His wife, Jane, helps in the fields and takes care of some financial records and administrative functions for the farming business. Because Jane is already a service to the farm operation, Joe makes her a true employee and begins providing her with compensation. They are now eligible for HRAs.\n\nJoe compensates Jane a total of $14,000 per year in the following way:\n\n1. Reimbursement for family health premiums: $7,000 2. Reimbursements for uninsured medical expenses: $5,000 3. W-2 Cash Wages: $2,000 TOTAL $14,000\n\nBy allowing for a 100% federal, state and FICA tax deduction of the $12,000 of reimbursed expenses, Joe would receive $4,200 in actual tax dollar savings by taking advantage of a Section 105 Plan. (Note: the tax savings is assuming rates of 15% federal, 5% state and 15% FICA taxes=35% savings).\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that farmers who file as C corporations don\u2019t need to abide by the spouse/employee method. The corporation is viewed as the employer in this case and the owner is an employee as long as the employee is receiving scheduled pay. Also note farm entities and sole proprietors with two or more employees may not be eligible for this special deduction because at the two or more employee threshold the new Affordable Health Care Act rules require certain \u201cessential health benefits\u201d (group insurance) and the Section 105 HRA rules may not apply. If you have two or more employees, we advise you consult your accountant for other potential health care solutions.\n\nAgriPlanNOW and BizPlanNOW is a couple of the HRAs you may have heard about. HRAs like these aren\u2019t too confused with actual insurance plans. These are reimbursement programs that you must enroll in and there are annual fees, but the savings they provide far outweigh the upfront costs. Once enrolled, you will work with your insurance provider and tax professional to lower your out-of-pocket costs. Because you\u2019re medical costs are now classified as business expenses you will see your deductions increase and tax savings will be the result. Savings will of course vary, but the average is around $5,000 per year.\n\nOnce you submit an application for an HRA and you are enrolled, then it becomes vital to keep receipts and all records of medical expenses and health insurance premiums as well as payroll transactions. All this information will need to be reviewed and submitted at year-end by your tax professional. A CPA with experience in working with agribusiness professionals can assist you with proper record keeping and of course the tax reporting piece of the puzzle.\n\nBrian E.
