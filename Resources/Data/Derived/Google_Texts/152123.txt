Should Lady Gaga just stick to crazy costumes and thrusting about with her Little Monsters?

On Wednesday, the pop princess attempted to help the President out by tweeting her support for ObamaCare – but botched things up not once, but twice.

First, Gaga posted a picture of herself – accidentally rotated sideways – holding a sign with the tag #getcovered. However, the included URL was written as healthcare.org instead of the more accurate healthcare.gov.

The incorrect message was removed, and the “Edge of Glory” singer re-posted the tweet this time with her photo turned the right way, but with the same incorrect link. Sigh.

That message later disappeared as well, and finally she got it right – and a bonus retweet from the White House.

But this isn’t the first time celebrities have botched Twitter tasks delegated to them from government forces. In 2011, Kim Kardashian was asked by the Los Angeles Police Department to warn her followers of an impending highway closure.

Kardashian complied, tweeting: "Remember this weekend the 405 Fwy is gonna be closed between the San Fernando Valley and the West Side!!"

Just one problem. The closure wasn’t until two weeks time. The "Keeping Up With the Kardashians" star tried to correct her mistake, tweeting: "Remember next weekend the 405 Fwy is gonna be closed between the San Fernando Valley and the West Side!!"

Wrong again. She scrubbed both botches and finally got the dates right.
