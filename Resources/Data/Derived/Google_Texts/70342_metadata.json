The Nation, which is located in Fort Dick, California, filed its letter of intent to petition for federal acknowledgment in 1983 and is No. 85 on the Office of Federal Acknowledgment\u2019s (OFA) List of Petitioners.\n\nUnder the law a petitioning group must meet seven mandatory criteria to be federally acknowledged as an American Indian tribe. It must prove that:\n\n-- \u201cexternal observers\u201d have identified the tribe as an American Indian tribe on a \u201csubstantially continuous basis\u201d since 1900\n\n-- a predominant part of the group has maintained a distinct community since historical times.\n\n-- it has maintained political influence since historical times.\n\n-- it has a \u201cgoverning document\u201d\n\n-- its members descend from a historical Indian tribe.\n\n-- its members are not members of another federally acknowledged Indian tribe\n\n-- it has not been subject to legislation forbidding the federal relationship.\n\nIn reviewing the Tolowa Nation\u2019s petition, the OFA found that the tribe did not meet the second criteria \u2013 it did not provide enough evidence to prove that a predominant portion of its group has existed as a distinct community from historical times until the present.\n\nUnder the regulations, the failure to meet all seven criteria requires a determination that the petitioning group is not an Indian tribe within the meaning of federal law.\n\nThe Tolowa Nation people are descendants of the XUS (\u201cHUSS\u201d), according to its website. They are from the rocky Pacific coastline northwest of California and southwest of Oregon. They live in the watersheds of the Smith, Winchuck, Rogue and Chetco rivers. Their ancestors lived, traveled and traded up and down the coast, taking part in the Chinook\u2019s international trade on the Columbia River. They made early contact with the Spanish, Russian, Chinese and Hudson Bay Company traders prior to the western Gold Rush of 1849. The Tolowa Nation does not have a reservation or rancheria; its members live on their own land mostly in Del Norte and Curry counties.\n\nThe Interior Department issued a proposed finding recommending against acknowledgment of the Tolowa Nation in November 2010, for not providing evidence of existing as a distinct community since historical times. The final determination followed a review of the petitioner\u2019s and public\u2019s comments on the proposed finding, but the review did not yield enough evidence to change the decision not to acknowledge Tolowa. This final determination will become effective 90 days after its publication as a notice in the Federal Register on January 24 unless the petitioner or any interested party requests reconsideration with the Interior Board of Indian Appeals within that period.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Interior Department Assistant Secretary \u2013 Indian Affairs Kevin Washburn issued the final determination not to acknowledge the Tolowa Nation recently.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/02/08/tolowa-recognition-denied-153458", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "type": "article", "title": "Tolowa Recognition Denied"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dc": {"title": "Tolowa Recognition Denied"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/02/08/tolowa-recognition-denied-153458", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.creator": "kpolisse", "dcterms.date": "2014-02-08T09:00-05:00", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Federal Recognizition, Interior Department, Assistant Secretary \u2013 Indian Affairs, Kevin Washburn, Tolowa Nation, Office of Federal Acknowledgment\u2019s List of Petitioners", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.title": "Tolowa Recognition Denied"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd986\"", "article_summary": "The Tolowa Nation\u2019s bid for federal recognition has been denied.\nThe Tolowa Nation people are descendants of the XUS (\u201cHUSS\u201d), according to its website.\nInterior Department Assistant Secretary \u2013 Indian Affairs Kevin Washburn issued the final determination not to acknowledge the Tolowa Nation on January 24.\nThe Tolowa Nation does not have a reservation or rancheria; its members live on their own land mostly in Del Norte and Curry counties.\nThe Interior Department issued a proposed finding recommending against acknowledgment of the Tolowa Nation in November 2010, for not providing evidence of existing as a distinct community since historical times."}
