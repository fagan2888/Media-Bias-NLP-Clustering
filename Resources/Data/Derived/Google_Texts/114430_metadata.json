Richard Hanna of New York, one of the five GOP co-sponsors of the House version ENDA, pointed to his party's loss in the Virginia governor's race on Tuesday as a reason why the House needs to consider the measure.\n\n\"Certainly what we see in Virginia is a difficulty with women and minorities and that's something the party needs to reconcile and look broadly and think about,\" Hanna told CNN on Thursday.\n\nHanna's message to the GOP was \"we need to understand that standing on our own principles is part of this, but the world is a pluralistic place and we represent a broad cross section of Americans of different races, generations, sexual orientations, and everyone has rights.\"\n\nThe Republican National Committee found after last year's loss in the presidential election that younger Americans, who voted disproportionately for Barack Obama, weigh their support for a political party based on its tolerance and inclusiveness, including on the issue of gay rights.\n\n10 Republican Senators vote with Dems\n\nAdvocates of ENDA also point to national polls that show a majority of Republicans now support legislation protects gays and lesbians from job discrimination. On Thursday 10 GOP senators joined with Senate Democrats to pass the measure.\n\nSeveral senior House Republican congressional aides acknowledge the political climate has shifted some since the House last considered ENDA in 2007, but they also believe most House GOP members would oppose it now.\n\nThey say members aren't hearing much about it from their constituents, so there's little pressure to vote on it this year.\n\nPennsylvania Rep. Charlie Dent, a five-term Republican whose district has been targeted regularly by Democrats, is another Republican who is pushing for a House vote.\n\nDent told CNN the party's loss to Obama is a key reason why it should get behind the bill.\n\n\"I do believe that we have to learn some lessons from the 2012 election, and to me this is one of them. This legislation, ENDA, is one way to reach out to the LGBT community in a way that is fair and reasonable and speaks to our shared values. I think we all agree we should not tolerate this type of discrimination in any form,\" Dent said.\n\nDent also said passing the measure \"would be an upside to the party, particularly with young voters.\"\n\nOutside advocacy groups spent the past year targeting states with GOP Senators to secure votes to pass the bill in the Senate.\n\nLittle pressure on House GOP\n\nBut House districts were redrawn in 2010 to make them more solidly red or blue so there are fewer \"swing\" districts like those Dent and Hanna represent, reducing leverage for supporters.\n\n\"As far as specific House races are concerned, I can't see it being a main issue,\" one of the House GOP sources said in predicting that the issue \"will kind of fade by Friday\" without any real push by members for a vote.\n\nEven gay rights advocates who sought to pressure GOP Senators aren't sugar coating prospects in the House.\n\n\"It's an uphill climb. It's Mount Kilimanjaro,\" Fred Sainz, vice president of communications at the Human Rights Campaign, told CNN.\n\nThe House Education and the Workforce Committee, which has jurisdiction over the issue, has yet to announce a hearing on the bill, and doesn't plan any action on ENDA at this point, according to a spokeswoman for the panel.\n\nOne place where a House Republican could face blowback for lack of action is in upstate New York.\n\nSecond-term GOP Rep. Chris Gibson is running against an openly gay Democratic candidate, Sean Eldridge, who has worked as an advocate for same-sex marriage. Gibson recently signed on as a co-sponsor of the House ENDA bill.\n\nObamacare still a focus\n\nBut GOP aides believe that highlighting problems with the online rollout of Obamacare and focusing on economic issues should remain their top priorities, and say there is little pressure from GOP rank and file to move ENDA, because they largely oppose the bill.\n\nSupporters believe the 2007 House vote, when 35 House Republicans backed the legislation, could be a marker of how many GOP members could vote for the bill now.\n\nBut of that group only a dozen still serve in the House.\n\nAmong those who supported that measure was 2012 GOP vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin.\n\nBut that version of ENDA was drafted more narrowly and Ryan's spokesman says the Congressman is opposed to the Senate bill at this point.\n\n\"Congressman Ryan does not believe someone should be fired because of their sexual orientation. That said, any legislation to address this concern should be narrowly crafted to guard against unintended consequences,\" Kevin Seifert told CNN.\n\nHouse Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi said Boehner's move to avoid a vote is part of a pattern, criticizing his decision to spend money backing a court challenge to uphold a ban on same-sex marriage, which the Supreme Court overruled.\n\nFighting a losing battle in the House\n\nDemocrats might try to force a vote through a procedural maneuver but know it probably won't happen.\n\nSainz told CNN the effort to pass the bill will take some time, but the Human Rights Campaign is working to get at least 25 of the 35 House Republicans they believe would vote for the bill to publicly endorse it.\n\nHe said ENDA should fit into the House Republican's economic agenda since it promotes employees keeping their jobs.\n\nSupporters are also looking for other ways to get it to the House floor.\n\nOne option is attaching the measure to next year's defense authorization bill in the Senate and sending that to the House.\n\nBy tucking the measure into a must-pass bill that House Republicans support, any effort to oppose ENDA would mean adopting an amendment to strip it out. Advocates believe they could muster the votes to block that.\n\nThis strategy was used to move another contentious issue involving gay rights -- the repeal of the \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy barring service in the military.\n\nDent believes outside advocates need to do some legwork to educate House Republicans, many of whom didn't serve in Congress the last time the issue came up for a vote.\n\nBut he notes this session of Congress doesn't wrap up until the end of 2014 so \"they'll be time over the next 14 to 15 months to make progress in the House.\"\n\nSainz said he is prepared for the challenge and predicts the same constituents who moved the Senate to act will do the same in the House.\n\n\"There are gay people in every single member of Congress' district who we will mobilize,\" he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Senate passed bill to bar workplace discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity but there's little chance it will get a vote in the House", "pubdate": "2013-11-07T21:56:35Z", "author": "By Deirdre Walsh, CNN Senior Congressional Producer", "og": {"site_name": "CNN", "description": "The Senate passed bill to bar workplace discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity but there's little chance it will get a vote in the House", "pubdate": "2013-11-07T21:56:35Z", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2013/11/07/politics/lgbt-workplace-discrimination-house-outlook/index.html", "image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/131107153735-mark-kirk-senate-floor-t3-entertainment.jpg", "type": "article"}, "section": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 80401312489}, "thumbnail": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/131107153735-mark-kirk-senate-floor-t3-entertainment.jpg", "source": "CNN", "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.cnn.com/2013/11/07/politics/lgbt-workplace-discrimination-house-outlook/index.html"}, "keywords": "politics, LGBT anti-discrimination bill going nowhere in the House - CNNPolitics.com", "lastmod": "2013-11-07T21:56:35Z", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3009\"", "article_summary": "Gibson recently signed on as a co-sponsor of the House ENDA bill.\nSupporters believe the 2007 House vote, when 35 House Republicans backed the legislation, could be a marker of how many GOP members could vote for the bill now.\nOne place where a House Republican could face blowback for lack of action is in upstate New York.\nSeveral senior House Republican congressional aides acknowledge the political climate has shifted some since the House last considered ENDA in 2007, but they also believe most House GOP members would oppose it now.\nAnd Rory Cooper, spokesman for House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, told CNN \"the bill is currently not scheduled\" for consideration."}
