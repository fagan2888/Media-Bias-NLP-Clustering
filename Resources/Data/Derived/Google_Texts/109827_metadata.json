And as of today, you can add the doggie day care business to the list of targets \u2013 Camp Bow Wow, which has sold 152 franchises in the U.S. and Canada since 2003, has been snapped up by VCA, one of the country\u2019s biggest animal health companies.\n\nVCA's stock-market ticker, it should be noted, is WOOF.\n\nAnd now, WOOF will include Camp Bow Wow. \u201cAcross the nation, the demand for dog daycare is growing,\u201d reads the opening to Camp Bow Wow\u2019s explanation for why its services are in demand. And this isn\u2019t a standard kennel we\u2019re talking about here: \u201cWe provide a social environment for our dogs,\u201d the company says, letting them spend the day playing together outdoors, with a a staff-to-canine ratio of 1:15.\n\nAnd not any random mutt can get into this club \u2013 the camp has \u201ca very stringent application and interview process\u201d, which about 10% of dogs flunk. It has become a business that employs thousands and brings in tens of millions in revenue each year, reports the WSJ\u2019s Ryan Dezember:\n\nAs part of the deal, Ms. Ganahl plans to hire a president to run Camp Bow Wow\u2019s day-to-day operations, while she, as chief executive, focuses on strategy. Camp Bow Wow\u2019s core business offers day care for dogs at franchise-owned facilities, starting at about $25 a day, as well as overnight boarding for between $40 and $60 a night. Since settling on a franchise model in 2003, the company has sold 152 franchises in the U.S. and Canada. Of those, 122 camps and seven house-call franchises are running, two are corporate-owned, with the rest in development. Some of the franchises also offer dog training. The company said that together, the businesses employ about 3,500 people and last year generated systemwide sales of $71 million.\n\nCamp Bow Wow has capitalized on the vast sums of money owners are willing to spend on their animals, with Halloween costumes for pets now estimated to be a $300 million market and retailer PetSmart rolling out pet clothing branded by the likes of Martha Stewart and Tommy Bahama. In April, Mars Inc. agreed to pay $2.9 billion to buy Iams and other pet food brands from Procter & Gamble.\n\nMars, which is not publicly traded and doesn\u2019t disclose results, is the largest pet food maker in the world, and sold an estimated $16.5 worth of the stuff in 2012. Among its more intriguing pet offerings: Wisdom Panel, a DNA testing service for dogs.\n\nSee also:\n\nVCA to Acquire Camp Bow Wow Chain \u2013 WSJ", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "In a land where Halloween outfits for pets are a $300 million business, it seems reasonable that a chain of more than 120 day care centers for dogs its a target for corporate takeover.", "title": "Camp Bow Wow Joins the 2014 Merger Frenzy", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2014/08/04/camp-bow-wow-joins-the-2014-merger-frenzy/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OB-WH351_0208do_G_20130208130724.jpg"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Business", "article.headline": "Camp Bow Wow Joins the 2014 Merger Frenzy", "description": "In a land where Halloween outfits for pets are a $300 million business, it seems reasonable that a chain of more than 120 day care centers for dogs its a target for corporate takeover.", "article_section": "Business", "author": "Tom Gara", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "testkeys": "C", "article.page": "Corporate Intelligence Blog", "page.subsection": "Corporate Intelligence", "article.summary": "In a land where Halloween outfits for pets are a $300 million business, it seems reasonable that a chain of more than 120 day care centers for dogs its a target for corporate takeover.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.published": "2014-08-04T22:46:31-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-158", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2014/08/04/camp-bow-wow-joins-the-2014-merger-frenzy/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-234B-5291", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Business", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "In a land where Halloween outfits for pets are a $300 million business, it seems reasonable that a chain of more than 120 day care centers for dogs its a target for corporate takeover.", "title": "Camp Bow Wow Joins the 2014 Merger Frenzy", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2014/08/04/camp-bow-wow-joins-the-2014-merger-frenzy/", "image": {"width": 553, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OB-WH351_0208do_G_20130208130724.jpg", "height": 369}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Corporate Intelligence", "article.id": "BL-234B-5291", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-08-04T22:49:50-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2801\"", "article_summary": "See also:VCA to Acquire Camp Bow Wow Chain \u2013 WSJ\nAnd now, WOOF will include Camp Bow Wow.\n\u201cAcross the nation, the demand for dog daycare is growing,\u201d reads the opening to Camp Bow Wow\u2019s explanation for why its services are in demand.\nCamp Bow Wow\u2019s core business offers day care for dogs at franchise-owned facilities, starting at about $25 a day, as well as overnight boarding for between $40 and $60 a night.\nAFP/Getty ImagesThere\u2019s a frenzy of merger and acquisition activity underway right now, in industries ranging from pharmaceuticals to communications and media."}
