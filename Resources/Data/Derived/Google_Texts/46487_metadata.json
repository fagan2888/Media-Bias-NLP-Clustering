In April 2010, there was an explosion on BP\u2019s drilling rig in the Gulf of Mexico, which killed 11 people and resulted in some 205 million gallons of crude oil being dumped into the water. Not only was this incident among the worst BP had ever experienced, it was also one of the worst environmental disasters in American history.\n\nBP pled guilty to multiple counts of federal criminal violations and had to pay the U.S. Justice Department about $4.5 billion in fines, not including the amount of money the company spent trying to clean up the gulf and aiding those affected by the spill. The company was also debarred from receiving new leases in the Gulf of Mexico or Alaska.\n\nIn response to the EPA\u2019s announcement, Rena Steinzor, president of the Center for Progressive Reform and law professor at the University of Maryland Carey School of Law, cautioned that the U.S. government\u2019s decision to possibly partner with BP once again was a dangerous precedent that sends the message to the energy industry that \u201cno matter how much harm you do, no matter how horrid your safety record, the feds will cut you some slack.\u201d\n\nSteinzor told MintPress News that \u201cBP is a very large corporation and it has a certain personality that is very, very strong,\u201d which she says is to \u201ccut costs relentlessly in an effort to make its bottom line look better.\u201d\n\nBP is so concerned about its profits, Steinzor said, that it allows its facilities fall into disrepair.\n\n\u201cThere is a very good book on this subject,\u201d she said, \u201ccalled \u2018Run to Failure,\u2019 and that is what they do \u2014 run everything into the ground. This mentality has killed people and caused terrible damage to the environment in this country.\u201d\n\nThe EPA, however, seems to disagree.\n\n\u201cThis is a fair agreement that requires BP to improve its practices in order to meet the terms we\u2019ve outlined together,\u201d EPA Assistant Administrator of Administration and Resource Management Craig Hooks said in a press release. \u201cMany months of discussions and assessments have led up to this point, and I\u2019m confident we\u2019ve secured strong provisions to protect the integrity of federal procurement programs.\u201d\n\nWhile the EPA says BP will be required to retain an agency-approved, independent auditor to conduct an annual review and report on BP\u2019s compliance with the EPA\u2019s rules and regulations, Steinzor said there is no way of knowing if BP has \u201cmended their ways\u201d until they are doing business with the U.S. once again. \u201cOnly time will tell,\u201d she said.\n\nShe also noted that while this is an unfortunate scenario, given that BP was only debarred for two years instead of five, the EPA is often forced to backtrack due to pressure from conservatives and political groups such as the Tea Party.\n\n\u201cThey are saying regulation is why we are in trouble,\u201d Steinzor explained, adding that a lack of regulation in the banking sector is the real reason the U.S. is in trouble.\n\nInstead of focusing on how unusual this case is, Steinzor said it\u2019s important for the public to realize and \u201cfocus on how BP has run rampant in the U.S.\u201d She gave three examples of unethical or irresponsible behavior on BP\u2019s part, not only in the Gulf of Mexico, but also in Alaska and Texas, saying that the company has proven over and over to be \u201camazingly incompetent\u201d and \u201cdrunk on risk.\u201d\n\n\u201c[BP] takes amazing risks with people\u2019s lives and the environment,\u201d Steinzor said. \u201cI think they are sort of like bad boys and we are unable to discipline them.\u201d\n\nPart of the reason BP may be escaping its debarred fate early is political pressure put on the EPA not only by the U.S. government, but also by British Prime Minister David Cameron.\n\nSteinzor told MintPress that the Cameron administration is concerned about whether BP is allowed to contract with the U.S. government or not, since British pension funds depend on the energy giant\u2019s success. She further explained that the company\u2019s biggest customer in the U.S. is the Defense Logistic Agency, which Steinzor said supplied about $2 billion worth of oil to the U.S. when it was fully deployed in Afghanistan a few years ago.\n\nSteinzor is also suspicious about the U.S. government\u2019s timing for taking BP off the debarred list. She pointed to lawmakers such as Sen. Mary Landrieu (D-LA), who released a statement applauding the decision to allow BP to make a bid on a contract.\n\n\u201cBP has rightly been held responsible in a court of law and should continue to make whole the individuals and businesses that were impacted by the oil spill, but barring them from entering new contracts on top of that amounted to double jeopardy and set a terrible precedent that I hope will not be repeated,\u201d Landrieu said in the statement. \u201cThe good news is that BP will now be able to participate in next week\u2019s lease sale that will bring much-needed revenue to Louisiana and other oil-producing states along the Gulf Coast.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Under an agreement reached Thursday with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, more than two dozen BP entities and its Houston-based oil production and exploration arm can secure new government contracts.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Katie Rucke", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "Under an agreement reached Thursday with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, more than two dozen BP entities and its Houston-based oil production and exploration arm can secure new government contracts.", "title": "EPA Caves Into Pressure, Resumes Contracts With BP", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/epa-caves-into-pressure-resumes-contracts-with-bp/186624/", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/BP-Oil-Spill-690x487.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-03-18T07:53:17-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Under an agreement reached Thursday with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, more than two dozen BP entities and its Houston-based oil production and exploration arm can secure new government contracts.", "creator": "@katierucke", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/BP-Oil-Spill.jpg", "title": "EPA Caves Into Pressure, Resumes Contracts With BP", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Front Page: Inside Stories", "tag": "Public Citizen's Energy Program", "published_time": "2014-03-15T05:00:52-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-03-18T07:53:17-05:00"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe088b\"", "article_summary": "EPA Caves Into Pressure, Resumes Contracts With BPThe oil company behind the largest offshore oil spill in U.S. history can once again perform work for the federal government.\nThis mentality has killed people and caused terrible damage to the environment in this country.\u201dThe EPA, however, seems to disagree.\nUntil Thursday, BP\u2019s ability to bid on contracts with the U.S. government had been suspended since November 2012, after the world\u2019s third-largest energy company entered a guilty plea in the Deepwater Horizon disaster.\nSteinzor is also suspicious about the U.S. government\u2019s timing for taking BP off the debarred list.\nThe company was also debarred from receiving new leases in the Gulf of Mexico or Alaska."}
