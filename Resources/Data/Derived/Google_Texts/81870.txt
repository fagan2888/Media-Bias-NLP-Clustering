This is probably not the smartest phrasing to use.

President Obama had an interview with Huffington Post over the weekend and while much of the interview was his oft-repeated lines about how Republicans are the reason nothing is getting done in Washington, he added a new phrase about his legacy that is bound to raise a few eyebrows.

Per the transcript:

“What we have done though is consistently looked for additional opportunities to get stuff done. Wherever we see a possibility of increasing wages, creating more jobs, making sure that more people are able to access opportunity, we’re gonna seize it. And we’re going to, wherever possible, try to reach out to Republicans and see if they can work with us. And where they’re not willing to work with us, we will do it administratively or we will convene the private sector.

By hook or by crook, we’re going to make sure that when I leave this office, that the country is more prosperous, more people have opportunity, kids have a better education, we’re more competitive, climate change is being taken more seriously than it was, and we are actually trying to do something about it. Those are going to be the measures by which I look back and say whether I’ve been successful as president.”

Doesn’t he have a whole team of PR professionals to avoid this kind of thing?
