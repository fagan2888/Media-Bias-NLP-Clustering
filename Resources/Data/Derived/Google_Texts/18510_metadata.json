It\u2019s right near the dirt basketball court. But if a game\u2019s going on, and you want to call strikes or fouls, you had better earn them.\n\nThat\u2019s where Corey Dickerson, the Rockies\u2019 breakthrough young outfielder, learned his trade \u2014 not baseball, but family turf war. It was Corey against Craig. Little brother against big brother.\n\nAdmire a home run a little too long? Get yelled at and pitched inside. Tackle on a layup? No foul.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d get to pushing and shoving. A bunch of our games led to fights,\u201d Craig said. \u201cBut he always worked harder than anybody I\u2019ve ever known. And played harder. I\u2019d do anything in this world for him. And I know he\u2019d do the same thing.\u201d\n\nLong before he was overlooked by big-college recruiters and many pro scouts, Corey Dickerson, an otherwise easygoing Southerner with a sweet tooth for ice cream, had a chip planted on his shoulder.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s in my nature, ever since I was young. Any kind of sport, I want to win,\u201d Dickerson said. \u201cI\u2019m really laid-back, but once I get in that position where it\u2019s me against him or me against whoever, I try to win. It\u2019s like a switch. I always turn it on.\u201d\n\nIn his first full season as a major-leaguer, the 25-year-old Dickerson has emerged as a future key for Colorado. With veteran Carlos Gonzalez and Michael Cuddyer injured, Dickerson was thrown into a Rockies lineup desperate for hitting.\n\nNow, approaching the all-star break, he\u2019s one of Colorado\u2019s most explosive hitters \u2014 his 1.020 OPS (on-base plus slugging percentages) ranks second on the team.\n\nAnd with Gonzalez openly acknowledging the possibility of a future trade from the Rockies, Dickerson\u2019s timetable for stardom \u2014 and Colorado\u2019s need for his production \u2014 is quickly approaching.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got a great mentality for this game. He\u2019s the epitome of unflappable,\u201d Rockies manager Walt Weiss said. \u201cHe accepts every challenge matter-of-factly. He doesn\u2019t care who you are on the mound. He expects to beat you. I don\u2019t think you can teach that. That\u2019s just the way he\u2019s wired.\u201d\n\nEarning more at-bats\n\nDickerson, a replacement in left field after Gonzalez had a tumor removed from his finger, has become the Rockies\u2019 second-best hitter, behind Troy Tulowitzki \u2014 with a .340 batting average, .402 on-base percentage and a .618 slugging percentage. In 65 games, he has 11 home runs and 14 doubles.\n\n\u201cYou find at-bats for a guy like that who can impact the game like \u2018Dickey\u2019 has,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cYou find a way to get him in the game.\u201d\n\nDickerson\u2019s numbers, although over an abbreviated sample size, are approaching those from Gonzalez\u2019s best year, in 2010, when he finished third in National League MVP voting. Dickerson\u2019s numbers for the slash line (AVG/OBP/SLG) are nearly identical to Gonzalez\u2019s from four years ago.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019d be nice to have them both,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cCorey\u2019s playing virtually every day now. And everybody\u2019s seeing the type of hitter we\u2019ve talked about for a year. He\u2019s a pure hitter. He has that rare ability to hit for very high average and power.\u201d\n\nWhen Gonzalez returns \u2014 likely sometime within the next two weeks \u2014 Dickerson may move to right field, Weiss said, or back to a part-time role.\n\nWith a crowded, six-deep Rockies outfield to start the season, Dickerson\u2019s role was situational. Weiss used the left-handed hitter primarily against right-handed pitchers. But with Gonzalez and Cuddyer out, the team\u2019s depth was tested. And Dickerson became a regular.\n\nHe has excelled, taking advantage of Coors Field\u2019s outfield. The lefty Dickerson has shown he can pull hits for power to right field and hit for average to center and left \u2014 his opposite-field average (.380) is well above the rest of the league (around .250).\n\n\u201cI think Walt, with a young guy, he wants to get your feet wet and get you comfortable,\u201d Dickerson said. \u201cAnd not just throw you to the wolves and get you beat down so you have to build yourself back up. He wants you to test the waters and know how the game works.\n\n\u201cHe knows I can handle that now.\u201d\n\nPingpong power stroke\n\nBack in McComb, in between tackle basketball games, Corey and Craig would play ball on the homemade diamond with a broomstick and a pingpong ball.\n\n\u201cBelieve it or not, you can make a pingpong ball do crazy things,\u201d said Craig, 27, who works off-shore on an oil rig near Mississippi. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s where he got his eye for baseball from.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s fair to say Dickerson was overlooked on scouting boards coming out of Meridian (Miss.) Community College in 2010. The Rockies drafted him in the eighth round, 260th overall, and he is one of only three in that round to play in the majors so far.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s always had to prove people wrong, because he didn\u2019t come from a high-profile college program; he\u2019s a small-town kid,\u201d Weiss said.\n\n\u201cHe probably heard a lot of people talk about the things he couldn\u2019t do. That\u2019s been a great motivator for him.\u201d\n\nScouts told Dickerson he could go as high as the third round, and the Philadelphia Phillies phoned him in the fifth round before passing. But Colorado, which had drafted him a year earlier in the 29th round (871st overall), went for him again.\n\n\u201cI feel like I\u2019ve never been given that much credit, even though I\u2019ve put up numbers everywhere I\u2019ve been, better than most players,\u201d Dickerson said.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t been talked about, and that\u2019s fine. But it keeps a chip on my shoulder. It keeps me wanting to get better. I just try to hold a chip on my shoulder no matter what. I just like to play the game hard.\u201d\n\nDickerson returned last week to Washington, where he doubled twice against the Nationals in his big-league debut in 2013. A year later, Dickerson, once a little brother, is next in line to be a big-bat Rockies slugger.\n\n\u201cI just kept the same routine, and be the same player I\u2019ve always been,\u201d Dickerson said. \u201cWhatever role I\u2019m in, I\u2019m going to compete no matter what. I\u2019m just going to take the chances I get and go with them.\u201d\n\nNick Groke: ngroke@denverpost.com or twitter.com/nickgroke\n\nCorey vs. Cargo\n\nCorey Dickerson\u2019s numbers in his first full big-league season are approaching those of the player he replaced after an injury.
