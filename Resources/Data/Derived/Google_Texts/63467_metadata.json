The \u201cpure play\u201d assisted living REIT commenced operations by spinning off from Ventas, Inc. (NYSE: VTR) and issuing around 84 million shares and OP units.\n\nAfter a full week of trading, shares climbed by 1.56 percent, even after the meltdown on Friday.\n\nCCP\u2019s portfolio consists of 355 properties, predominantly skilled nursing (90 percent), senior housing (5 percent), specialty hospitals (4 percent), and loans (1 percent). The closest competitor is Omega Healthcare Investors (NYSE: OHI), with 560 properties (525 being skilled nursing). No other REIT has such exposure in skilled nursing.\n\nIncluding CCP there are now 17 healthcare REITs and I have researched most of them (excluding CHCT, a micro-cap REIT that is on my radar list now). Here\u2019s a snapshot of all of the names (based on market capitalization):\n\nLater this week I will be providing premium iREIT Investor subscribers with my \u201cbracketology\u201d rankings and specifically I will be focusing on the healthcare REIT sector. The goal for the bracketology research is to evaluate the durability attributes for each REIT and provide a scoring system based on critical strength-related metrics. I weight each REIT based on a number of key metrics and then conclude the research with a completed ranking report for each company.\n\nWhile researching the growing list of healthcare REITs I have become more sensitive to the \u201cpure play\u201d REITs that own and operate assets within their \u201ccircle of competence\u201d. As you know, I own several of these so-called \u201cpure play\u201d REITs as well as 2-out-of-3 of the diversified healthcare REITs.\n\nThe recently announced CCP spinoff from VTR got me thinking\u2026\n\nShould I focus on the \u201cpure play\u201d REITs that offer a cleaner story or should I simply focus on the diversified REITs that have demonstrated decades of solid performance? Simply put, should I look to build my own basket of \u201cpure play\u201d REITs or just leave it up to Debra Cafaro (CEO of VTR) or Lauralee Martin (CEO of HCP)?\n\nHow Many Eggs In The Basket?\n\nFirst off, it\u2019s important to discuss the importance for diversification. I can\u2019t overestimate the importance of owning more than one REIT. Many of you know that one of my favorite REITs is Realty Income Corp (NYSE: O) and this security represents around 7 percent of my Durable Income Portfolio. While Realty Income is well-diversified, with over 4,000 individual properties, I must not put all of my eggs in one basket.\n\nThe same goes for VTR, another blue chip REIT that I have over-weighted. The diversification appeal for VTR is similar to my attraction for Realty Income \u2013 VTR owns 1,600 properties (prior to the CCP spin-off) with a highly predictable earnings history.\n\nAs I contemplate the notion of building a \u201cpure play\u201d healthcare REIT basket I believe it\u2019s critical to examine the operational acumen for each REIT. For example, within the assisted living sector there are two names to own: Omega Healthcare Investors Inc (NYSE: OHI) and Care Capital Properties.\n\nIt\u2019s important to remember that the assisted living sector is arguably the riskiest sub-sector in the healthcare space because of its reliance on government reimbursement. The more recent issues at HCP, Inc. and its primary tenant, HCR ManorCare, has validated the fear that unusually high tenant concentration within the skilled nursing sector is risky.\n\nHCP has around 25 percent exposure with HCR ManorCare and around 21 percent exposure in Brookdale \u2013 again, that mean risks are elevated. Conversely, Ventas has de-risked its business model by spinning off 355 skilled nursing properties and essentially eliminating the higher-yielding component.\n\nIf I was building a \u201cpure play\u201d basket today I would own OHI vs. CCP. Both enjoy conservative debt metrics, but OHI is larger (more diversified) and has a longer track record for increasing dividends.\n\nIn terms of hospitals, there are essentially two players. One is the \u201cpure play\u201d hospital REIT, Medical Properties Trust, Inc. (NYSE: MPW) and the other is Ventas, that just traded in its skilled nursing portfolio for hospitals leased to Ardent.\n\nThe tradeoff for Ventas is balanced \u2013 removing government pay risks for low-growth, high capital cost assets. I view the Ardent JV deal (with Sam Zell\u2019s company, EGI) as tactical since the partnership should enhance earnings and provide a pipeline for growth in the highly fragmented hospital sector.\n\nMPW shares have rebounded somewhat since the follow-on offering was announced and I\u2019m glad I picked up more shares \u2013 closed at $12.69 on Friday.\n\nIn terms of balance sheets, there is really no comparison. VTR is rated BBB+ by S&P and MPW is rated BB+. Here\u2019s a snapshot comparing the debt profiles for all of the healthcare REITs:\n\nMoving on to Senior Housing we have a similar comparison. There is just one \u201cpure play\u201d New Senior Investment Group Inc. (NYSE: SNR) \u2013 see my latest article HERE. If you view the debt chart above you can see that SNR has elevated leverage and that\u2019s one reason the shares are trading at a low multiple. Nonetheless, if you can stomach the leverage, SNR offers an attractive dividend yield of 9.1 percent.\n\nMoving onto to arguably the safest healthcare sector is MOB, or medical office buildings. There are 3 \u201cpure play\u201d MOB REITs and I own 2 of them: Healthcare Trust Of America Inc (NYSE: HTA) and Physicians Realty Trust (NYSE: DOC). I prefer MOBs over typical office buildings because of the driving forces in healthcare, namely the Affordable Care Act which provides enhanced physician demand.\n\nIf I were picking HTA over DOC today I would suggest HTA based on the fact that the company is covering its dividend and also because HTA is investment grade rated (BBB by S&P). Also, HTA recently announced a dividend increase ($.295 per share) of 1.7 percent (from the prior payment).\n\nOverall I consider OHI, MPW, SNR, and HTA to be the best candidates for the \u201cpure play\u201d healthcare basket. The average dividend yield for these 4 REITs is 6.75 percent compared with the average dividend yield for the 3 diversified healthcare REITs of 5.27 percent. Excluding HCP (trading with higher risk due to the assisted living exposure) the other 2 diversified healthcare REITs are yielding an average of 5.0 percent.\n\nIn other words, there\u2019s a 175 bps dividend premium for owing the basket of 4 \u201cpure play\u201d healthcare REITs (6.75 percent vs. 5.0 percent) and while that seems like an attractive value proposition, the benefits of owning shares in Ventas cannot be denied.\n\nThe only pure play (in my basket) that has successfully managed to increase dividends during the last recession is OHI. MPW cut its dividend and HTA and SNR were not publicly listed REITs during the financial crisis. So while the average 6.75 percent dividend yield may suggest sound investment acumen, the real power in Ventas is the skillful risk management practices that is the brand equity difference \u2013 or what I would refer to as the margin of safety.\n\nMr. Market has clearly telegraphed the message that SNR and MPW are riskier securities, while OHI and HTA appear to be valued appropriately (OHI owns higher risk government-pay related properties and HTA owns lower risk medical office buildings). So it would seem reasonable to assume that VTR should trade at the mid-point of the broader valuation spectrum.\n\nHowever, in addition to a successful track record for managing risk, VTR also has an exceptional record of dividend performance. The company has increased its annual dividend by an average of 9 percent over the last 4 years and the company said it expects to increase its dividend by 10 percent this quarter.\n\nThe Bottom Line: Ventas is \u201cpound for pound\u201d one of the best REITs to own and while there are benefits to owning \u201cpure play\u201d REITs, I consider the pros for owning VTR shares superior to the advantages of owning pure play healthcare REITs. Given the successful spin-off last week I am reiterating my STRONG BUY on the shares.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: I currently own shares in VTR, HTA, HCP, OHI, DOC, CCP, and MPW. I maintain over-weight positions in the healthcare REIT sector and many of my selections were purchased over two years ago. I am continuing to add shares to select positions when there is market mis-pricing.\n\nSources: SNL Financial and FAST Graphs.\n\nDisclaimer: This article is intended to provide information to interested parties.
