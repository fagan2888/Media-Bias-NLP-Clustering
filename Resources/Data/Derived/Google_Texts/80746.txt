The Broncos will unveil the Ring of Fame Plaza at Sports Authority Field at Mile High on Friday, Sept. 27 in a 6 p.m. event that will be open to the public.

Center Tom Nalen will become the 24th player in the Ring of Fame at a dinner that same day, and he and his 23 counterparts will each have a pillar in the plaza, which is located at the south end of the stadium. Nalen will be honored during the Broncos’ Sept. 29 home game against the Philadelphia Eagles.

The steel pillars are 8 feet tall, and each will feature a rendering of the player’s face, along with his name, number and a list of his greatest achievements.

“The Bronco greats — our Ring of Famers — are most deserving of this recognition,” Broncos owner and CEO Pat Bowlen said in a release. “They have made a lasting impact on the Denver Broncos, and I have deep appreciation for what they have meant to this franchise.”

Bowlen created the Ring of Fame in 1984 to honor players and administrators who played significant roles in the franchise’s history.
