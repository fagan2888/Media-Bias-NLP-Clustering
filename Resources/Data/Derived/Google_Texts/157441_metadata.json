The debates tend to run along familiar tropes \u2014 big government, free markets, personal responsibility, and so on. But the best insight into these fissures comes by looking at their opposite: What about those cases when big government is not the source of partisan discord?\n\nThis weekend, the Washington Post ran two long stories about cases like this. One explained the persistence of massive subsidies for sugar growers. Another reported on Medicare\u2019s astonishing inability to stop drug-makers from foisting a massively expensive drug on patients, rather than using a cheaper, equally effective alternative. Both articles reveal, through contradistinction, the real ideological source of the partisan divide.\n\nThe drug story explains how Medicare spends more than $1 billion a year reimbursing doctors who prescribe Lucentis, at $2,000 a dose, rather than Avastin, which costs $50 a dose, and which studies show works just as well. The story explains how Genentech has outmaneuvered the federal government, preventing it from requiring Medicare to reimburse Avastin instead. The reasons for this vast waste of taxpayer money are at once boring and infuriating, but they boil down to rules preventing the federal government from managing its Medicare dollars wisely. Here is a crucial passage:\n\nThe Medicare agency is blocked from seeking better drug prices by negotiating directly with the drug companies, as health agencies in other countries do. Authorities in Britain, for example, have negotiated a price of about $1,100 per dose of Lucentis, and in the Netherlands a dose sells for about $1,300.\n\nA spokesperson from the drug lobby proceeds to explain that, if the government refused to waste its Medicare spending, it would amount to \u201cprice controls.\u201d That has also been the Republican line. They do have a preferred alternative: encouraging patients to pinch their own medical pennies. That can certainly work in some cases. But patients are often helpless before the recommendations of their doctors, and the Post lays out a case that makes depressingly clear the imbalance of power and information between the average patient and a drug company that has far more skin in the game than a Medicare patient sprawled out on a doctor\u2019s bed could ever muster.\n\nWhen the Bush administration passed Medicare Part D, it fought off liberal amendments that would have let it save money by negotiating down the cost of the drugs it purchased. I wrote an article citing this, among other elements of the law, as evidence of the Bush administration\u2019s solicitousness toward the drug industry. David Frum, still a Bush loyalist at the time, rebutted my complaint by accusing me of favoring \u201cprice controls.\u201d And so the Post presents us with the necessary and intended result of this policy: a federal-government policy of wasting billions of dollars solely for private benefit.\n\nThis is what \"keep the government out of my Medicare\" means.

Despite lacking any public-policy merits whatsoever, the program survives with strong bipartisan support, ranging from Al Franken to Marco Rubio. The story ends on the comical note of quoting Florida Representative Ted Yoho, tea party maven and avowed enemy of big government, defending his strong advocacy of sugar subsidies: \u201cI ran on limited government, fiscal responsibility and free enterprise, but when you\u2019ve got programs that have been in place and it\u2019s the accepted norm, to just go in there and stop it would be detrimental to our sugar growers.\u201d\n\nYou hear that? Sugar subsidies are an accepted norm. If tea partiers believe anything, it\u2019s that, once a government program has been in place, we can\u2019t get rid of it. It would hurt sugar growers, Yoho proceeds to explain, by forcing them to sell their product in the free market on even terms. This is completely unlike programs such as Medicaid and food stamps, which Yoho wants to cut, because cutting them wouldn\u2019t be detrimental to anybody. At least not anybody he cares about.\n\nWe should be perfectly clear about the fact that Democrats do not have clean hands here \u2014 especially not on sugar subsidies, where Democrats representing rural constituents happily shovel billions into the farm subsidy maw. But the Republican enthusiasm for wasteful domestic spending here is what\u2019s especially telling, because it\u2019s the Republican Party that has declared rhetorical war on government, and which is its entire weight behind a broad-based assault on Obamacare, food stamps, unemployment benefits, and the entire structure of government support for the disadvantaged.\n\nRepublicans insist that they have nothing against the poor and sick, that they merely want to restrain the federal budget and so on. Were that true, they might be starting their assault on government with those programs benefiting the richest constituencies, coming for the hungry and jobless only at the end. Instead, it\u2019s the other way around: The only programs able to attract continuing Republican support are the ones whose only purpose is to enrich powerful interests.
