The community is mourning the loss of a longtime high school soccer coach and teacher.

Alan Shepherd, boys and girls head soccer coach and KMC teacher, passed away suddenly on Friday, August 21, 2015, due to a massive heart attack.

Coach Shepherd was the KMC head soccer coach for 24 years and led the soccer teams to numerous city, regional and state titles. He coached thousands of students over his expansive career, which also included coaching teams at Friends University, Newman University and Wichita area youth leagues.

"Our community mourns the sudden loss of Alan," says John Heise,

KMC Athletic Director. "There is a huge hole left in our hearts. We

keep the Shepherd family in our thoughts and prayers. His last tweet, 'I'm gonna make the rest of my life the best of my life' exemplifies how Alan lived his life and coached his kids."

KMC staff, students, parents and alumni were notified Saturday morning.

Effective immediately, KMC assistant soccer coach Anthony Cantele is acting head coach.

A rosary, funeral Mass and memorial service for students are being planned.

"This is a devastating loss to the whole KMC community. At times like this, we rely on our Catholic faith to pull through. We pray for the repose of his soul and for the consolation of the Shepherd family," says Rob Knapp, KMC President.
