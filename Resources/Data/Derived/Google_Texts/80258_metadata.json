It requires almost all individuals to obtain health insurance coverage or pay a penalty, and establishes health insurance exchanges (state or federal). Large employers may have to pay a penalty, if they don\u2019t offer full-time employees affordable, minimum-level health insurance after January 1, 2015, with some exceptions until January 1, 2016. Implementation details continue to be outlined through the issuance of new regulations, guidance, and FAQ documents from the Internal Revenue Service, Department of Labor, and Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nBaker said the definition of \u201clarge employer\u201d varies depending upon the section of the law one is referring to. For employer mandate and penalties: In 2015, a large employer is 100 or more full-time (FT) employees plus full-time equivalents (FTEs). In 2016, it\u2019s 50 or more FT employees plus FTEs. Eligibility for premium tax credits: 25 or fewer employees earning less than average of $50,000.\n\nNot in place yet is a regulation that requires employers with 100 or more employees to auto-enroll.\n\nThe employer penalty implementation timeline:\n\n\u2022 For 2015: All applicable large employers must offer coverage to at least 70% of their full-time employees to avoid a $2,000 penalty, and a $3,000 penalty may still apply for uncovered; for employers with 100 or more employees, a $2,000 penalty applies after the first 80 full-time employees if no insurance is offered; there are no penalties for employers with 50-99 employees who meet certain criteria, and no penalties between January and the plan year start for certain non-calendar year plans.\n\n\u2022 For 2016: All employers with 50 or more employees must offer coverage to at least 95% of full-time employees to avoid penalties; a $2,000 no-insurance penalty is assessed after the first 30 FT employees (no longer 80); Small Business Health Options Program (SHOP) is open to all employers with fewer than 100 employees; and the information return for 2015 is to be filed with the IRS.\n\n\u2022 For 2017: SHOP coverage is open to all small and large employers.\n\nLarge employers\n\nBaker said large employers are subject to one of two \u201cshared responsibility\u201d penalties if any FT employee receives exchange subsidies. For employers that own multiple companies, the 50-plus-employees classification is determined by a control group or affiliated service group. For \u201cminimum essential coverage\u201d, see IRS Notice 2012-31 at: http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-12-31.pdf.\n\nFor 2015, an employer can determine whether or not it is a large employer by selecting any consecutive six-month period in 2014. The seasonal worker exception can only be used if looking at a full calendar year.\n\nFor the first year an employer is determined to be a large employer, an employer has until April 1 of that year to offer affordable, minimum-value coverage to previously uncovered full-time employees without being subject to the $3,000 penalty for the first three months. The failure to offer any coverage by April 1 can result in a $2,000 penalty applying as of January 1. There is one-time-only transition relief even if it drops below the 50 threshold.\n\nMethods for determining full-time status of employees:\n\n\u2022 Monthly measurement. Total each employees hours worked each month and compare to 130 hours. If at or over 130, they\u2019re full-time. There is an optional \u201cweekly rule.\u201d The positive is that this calculates the actual number of full-time employees in real time, but the negative is that employees are on/off the plan monthly.\n\n\u2022 Look-back measurement. The employer uses prior hours of service over an employer-selected period as a determinant of future full-time status. The positive is the predictability, and a longer measurement period can reduce the number to which benefits must be offered, but the negative is that it may not accurately reflect the number of full-time employees.\n\nIRS Notice 2012-58 and the December 2012 IRS/HHS proposed regulations explain a method employers may use to determine full-time status for ongoing employees, new employees, and variable-hour and seasonal workers.\n\nThe measurement period is three to 12 months (employer determined); the administrative period is up to 90 days, and must overlap with the prior stability period so there are no coverage gaps; and the stability period is the greater of six months or the measurement period length.\n\nBaker said the look-back measurement method can be used for ongoing employees, and for new variable-hour or seasonal employees.\n\n\u201cAn \u2018ongoing\u2019 employee is someone employed for at least one standard measurement period,\u201d she said. \u201cThe method cannot be used for new employees who are not variable-hour or seasonal. If they\u2019re hired to be full-time, they must be treated as full-time at the start.\u201d\n\nShe gave some key terms for the look-back measurement method:\n\n\u2022 Initial measurement period (IMP). A period of three to 12 consecutive months as selected by the employer used under the look-back measurement method. For 2015, all current employees\u2019 IMP will start on same date. For new hires, IMP will begin on their first day of employment or up to and including the first day of the first calendar month following their start date.\n\n\u2022 Standard measurement period (SMP). Same definition as IMP but applies to ongoing employees.\n\n\u2022 Administrative period. Optional period that begins immediately following the end of SMP and ends immediately before the start of the stability period. Maximum of 90 days, which includes gaps between start date and IMP start. Must overlap with a prior stability period so there\u2019s no gap in coverage. May differ by category of employee.\n\n\u2022 Stability period. The period that immediately follows and is associated with the standard or initial measurement period. Duration is the greater of six months or the length of the measurement period. Must be same length for ongoing as new variable hour, new seasonal, and new part-time employees.\n\nShe said there is a transition measurement period between six and 12 consecutive months, starting no later than July 1, 2014, and ending no earlier than 90 days before the start of the 2015 plan year.\n\nShe clarified the types of employees:\n\n\u2022 Full-time. One who has an average of 30 hours of service per week or 130 hours per month.\n\n\u2022 On-going. An employee who has been employed by the employer for at least one complete standard measurement period.\n\n\u2022 New employee. An employee that has not yet been employed for one complete standard measurement period. Expected to work full time: Up to 90-day waiting period permitted if full-time. No penalty during waiting period.\n\n\u2022 Variable hour. An employee for whom it is unclear whether they will average 30 hours of service/week for an entire measurement period. Employer has up to 13 months to determine full-time status and offer coverage before penalty.\n\nVarying periods\n\nBaker said measurement/stability periods can vary.\n\n\u201cYou may use different measurement/stability periods by classification of employee,\u201d she said. \u201cThat includes collectively bargained employees and non-collectively bargained employees; salaried employees and hourly employees; employees of different entities; and employees located in different states.\n\n\u201cFor new variable or seasonal employees, the measurement plus administrative period cannot be more than 13 months after the employee\u2019s start date. The stability period cannot exceed the remainder of the first SMP. The stability period cannot be more than one month longer than IMP.\u201d\n\nShe said an employer can choose any duration between three and 12 months to determine full-time status of employees for whom it is not certain whether they will be full-time. She said rules appear to suggest that where the initial and standard stability periods overlap and conflict, defer the stability period where an individual is considered full-time and offer coverage.\n\nThe final rule clarified application of situations where stability periods are longer than measurement periods: The next measurement period must begin at the latest date that does not result in a gap between stability periods. Stability periods must equal measurement period when on-going employee does not meet the 30 hours of service per week during a prior measurement period.\n\nIn a seasonal worker example, an employer is only required to offer employee coverage for eight months out of a possible 27 months.\n\nThe following count as employees:\n\n\u2022 Educational employees. If full-time for school year, then treated as full-time for the calendar year.\n\n\u2022 Adjunct faculty. Until further guidance, employers are to establish a reasonable method for crediting hours of service that is consistent with the ACA. The IRS optional method equals 2.25 hours of service per week for each hour of teaching or classroom time.\n\n\u2022 Paid student interns or externs. Seasonal employees are counted in determining liability for employer penalties.\n\nThe following do not count as employees:\n\n\u2022 Bona fide volunteers. Applies to volunteers of government or tax-exempt entities. Allowed to compensate for reasonable expenses or reasonable benefits.\n\n\u2022 Seasonal worker. Can exclude from large-employer determination if they work 120 days or less in preceding calendar years.\n\n\u2022 Student work-study programs. Only for service performed by students under federal or state-sponsored work-study programs.\n\n\u2022 Home care workers. Where the service recipient is the common law employer of the worker.\n\n\u2022 Real estate agents and direct sellers.\n\nShe said a seasonal employee is \u201can employee who is hired into a position for which the customary annual employment is six months or less. There is no reference to consecutive months.\u201d\n\nA seasonal worker is one \u201cwho performs labor or services on a seasonal basis as defined by the Secretary of Labor and retail workers hired exclusively for the holidays. Employers may apply a reasonable, good-faith interpretation of this term. You can exclude them from large-employer calculations if they work 120 days or less in preceding calendar years and this is cause for the employer to exceed 50.\u201d\n\nOn adjunct professors, she said: \u201cUntil further guidance, employers are to establish a reasonable method for crediting hours of service that is consistent with the ACA. The IRS optional method equals 2.25 hours of service per week for each hour of teaching or classroom time.\u201d\n\nOn the employment break rule: \u201cIn the hours calculation for school year versus calendar year, treat them as a continuing employee (not rehired) unless there are no hours of service for 26 weeks or more.\n\nThere is optional rehire status if there are no hours for at least four consecutive weeks and this period of no hours exceeds the employee\u2019s immediately preceding period of employment.\n\nIn terms of on-call employees, she said: \u201cFinal IRS rules (2/10/2014) require an employer to \u2018use a reasonable method for crediting hours of service\u2019 consistent with ACA.\n\nIt is NOT reasonable to provide zero credit hours in any of the following circumstances: for any on-call hour for which payment is made or due by the employer, or if an employee must remain on-call on the employer\u2019s premises, or where the employee\u2019s activities while on-call are substantially restricted, preventing the employee from using the time effectively for their own purposes.\n\nNew employee status equals no hours of service for more than 13 weeks\u2014except for educational organization employees where the standard remains 26 weeks. This applies to both the monthly and look-back measurement methods.\n\nContinuing employee status equals no hours for less than 13 weeks. Continue previous measurement/stability periods when they return to work. Health coverage continues the first day of work if they\u2019re considered FT at the time of absence.\n\nIf the 12-month measurement period is used by the employer, the employee may not meet the threshold for full-time status due to zero hours accrued during absence.\n\nShe said casual employers can consider an employee a new hire when employees are absent fewer than 13 weeks, if the period with no hours of service is at least four weeks long AND longer than the employee\u2019s employment period immediately before the absence.\n\nA penalty is only assessed if a FT employee receives exchange subsidies. Employees are ineligible for subsidies if the employer coverage is affordable. This also applies if coverage is not offered to at least 70% (from 2016 and beyond, it must be 95%) of FT employees and their dependent children under age 26.\n\nFor those that offer coverage to 70% of FT employees for Plan Year 2015: If they meet or exceed, there is no $2,000 penalty assessed for all of Plan Year 2015 but a $3,000 penalty still can be assessed under these circumstances. They can only count a FT employee as offered coverage, if their dependent children under age 26 were offered coverage. Dependent transition relief applies. \u2666", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Regulations", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "og": {"url": "http://bulktransporter.com/regulations/employer-penalties-obamacare-kick-early-2015-businesses-could-take-major-hit", "image": "http://bulktransporter.com//sites/all/themes/bulktransporter/images/logo.png", "type": "website", "description": "The Affordable Care Act\u2014also known as Obamacare\u2014has been a controversial flash point", "title": "Employer penalties for Obamacare kick off in  early 2015, businesses could take major hit"}, "title": "Employer penalties for Obamacare kick off in  early 2015, businesses could take major hit"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd73a2\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThat includes collectively bargained employees and non-collectively bargained employees; salaried employees and hourly employees; employees of different entities; and employees located in different states.\nFor employer mandate and penalties: In 2015, a large employer is 100 or more full-time (FT) employees plus full-time equivalents (FTEs).\nTotal each employees hours worked each month and compare to 130 hours.\nThe period that immediately follows and is associated with the standard or initial measurement period.\nFor 2015, an employer can determine whether or not it is a large employer by selecting any consecutive six-month period in 2014."}
