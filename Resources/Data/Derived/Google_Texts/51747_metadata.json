Speaking before guests\u2014including leaders of Jewish organizations and Jewish officials in the Obama administration\u2014invited to celebrate Rosh Hashanah, Biden recalled meeting Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir when he was a young man in the Senate:\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll never forget talking to her in her office with her assistant\u2014a guy named Rabin\u2014about the Six-Day War,\u201d he said. \u201cThe end of the meeting, we get up and walk out, the doors are open, and \u2026 the press is taking photos \u2026 She looked straight ahead and said, \u2018Senator, don\u2019t look so sad \u2026 Don\u2019t worry. We Jews have a secret weapon.\u2019\u201d He said he asked her what that secret weapon was. \u201cI thought she was going to tell me something about a nuclear program,\u201d Biden continued. \u201cShe looked straight ahead and she said, \u2018We have no place else to go.\u2019\u201d He paused, and repeated: \u201c\u2018We have no place else to go.\u2019\u201d \u201cFolks,\u201d he continued, \u201cthere is no place else to go, and you understand that in your bones. You understand in your bones that no matter how hospitable, no matter how consequential, no matter how engaged, no matter how deeply involved you are in the United States \u2026 there\u2019s only one guarantee. There is really only one absolute guarantee, and that\u2019s the state of Israel.\u201d\n\nWhen Biden was finished, Goldberg reports, \u201cThere was applause, and then photos, and then kosher canap\u00e9s.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s comments have attracted a fair amount of attention, not least from Goldberg, who was struck by their alarmist tone: \u201cThe vice president, it seemed to me, was trafficking in antiquated notions about Jewish anxiety.\u201d Washington Post columnist Dana Milbank agrees with Goldberg \u201cthat Jews are safe and happy in the United States today.\u201d But, he insists, \u201cthat could change.\u201d\n\nYet no one has remarked upon the fact of a sitting vice president telling a portion of the American citizenry that they cannot count on the United States government as the ultimate guarantor of their freedom and safety. The Constitution, which the vice president is sworn to uphold, guarantees to American citizens the \u201cBlessings of Liberty\u201d and equal protection of the law. Despite that, despite \u201chow deeply involved\u201d Jews \u201care in the United States,\u201d the occupant of the second-highest office in the land believes that American Jews should look to a foreign government as the foundation of their rights and security.\n\nA country that once offered itself as a haven to persecuted Jews across the world now tells its Jews that in the event of some terrible outbreak of anti-Semitism they should\u2026 what? Plan on boarding the next plane to Tel Aviv? It\u2019s like some crazy fiction from Philip Roth, except that when Roth contemplated an exodus in \u201cOperation Shylock,\u201d it was to imagine the Jews fleeing Israel for Poland. Even in Roth\u2019s \u201cThe Plot Against America,\u201d which does describe the triumph of European-style anti-Semitism in the U.S., it is not a foreign government but America itself that ultimately saves America\u2019s Jews.\n\nImagine a vice president or president saying something similar to any other American ethnic group. To the Irish, say, long the victim of subjugation in their homeland and persecution and discrimination in the United States. Imagine a president telling the Irish that they shouldn\u2019t consider the U.S. their real home, that they should keep their bags backed, a ticket to Dublin in the drawer, just in case.\n\nIn fact, when John F. Kennedy addressed the Irish Parliament in 1963, he said almost exactly the opposite of what Biden said. Like Biden, Kennedy affirmed his country\u2019s commitment to the self-determination and sovereignty of a long oppressed people: \u201cNo people ever believed more deeply in the cause of Irish freedom than the people of the United States.\u201d Like Biden, Kennedy was mindful that this long-oppressed people had not always been welcome in the U.S.:\n\nThey came to our shores in a mixture of hope and agony, and I would not underrate the difficulties of their course once they arrived in the United States\u2026. It is no wonder that James Joyce described the Atlantic as a bowl of bitter tears.\n\nUnlike Biden, however, Kennedy never envisioned Ireland as a refuge of last resort for the Irish of America; instead, Kennedy celebrated a continuing migration and return of the two peoples, a back and forth signifying the coming of age of freedom in the two nations. Ireland was no \u201clonger a country of persecution, political or religious. It is a free country, and that is why any American feels at home\u201d there. Likewise, the Irish in the U.S.\n\nI am deeply honored to be your guest in a free Parliament in a free Ireland. If this nation had achieved its present political and economic stature a century or so ago, my great grandfather might never have left New Ross, and I might, if fortunate, be sitting down there with you. Of course if your own president had never left Brooklyn, he might be standing up here instead of me.\n\nBoth countries, in other words, offered liberty, security and opportunity to the Irish: that was their connection, their glue.\n\nPerhaps the reason Biden\u2019s recommendation has gone so unnoticed\u2014despite Goldberg\u2019s article being discussed in Commentary and Slate and on NPR\u2014is that it speaks to a sentiment widely if privately shared in the Jewish community. As Milbank explains:\n\nEleven years ago, I carried my infant daughter into a synagogue basement and plunged her tiny body, head to toe, underwater. She emerged sputtering and coughing, then wailing. The procedure, immersion in a Jewish ritual bath called a mikvah, felt barbaric. But it was for an important reason: Her mother isn\u2019t Jewish, and by Jewish custom \u2014 and Israeli law \u2014 the faith is passed on by matrilineal descent, so I converted my daughter. Making sure she is Jewish in the eyes of the Jewish state gives me peace of mind. If the Gestapo ever comes again, she and her descendants will have a place to go. Just in case.\n\nEven so, and even if Biden is just playing to his audience, it\u2019s a stunning admission for a government official to make. Not just from the point of view of the Jewish citizens it hangs out to dry, but from the point of view of the government itself.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"No matter how deeply involved you are in the U.S. \u2026 there\u2019s only one guarantee ... and that's the state of Israel\"", "title": "Joe Biden\u2019s Israel stunner: American Jews should let Israel protect them", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "\"No matter how deeply involved you are in the U.S. \u2026 there\u2019s only one guarantee ... and that's the state of Israel\"", "title": "Joe Biden\u2019s Israel stunner: American Jews should let Israel protect them", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/03/29/joe_bidens_israel_stunner_american_jews_should_let_israel_protect_them/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/joe_biden.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"No matter how deeply involved you are in the U.S. \u2026 there\u2019s only one guarantee ... and that's the state of Israel\"", "title": "Joe Biden\u2019s Israel stunner: American Jews should let Israel protect them", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/joe_biden.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Corey Robin", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Benjamin Netanyahu, Corey Robin, Editor's Picks, Israel, Jeffrey Goldberg, Joseph Biden, Religion", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd26a5\"", "article_summary": "Imagine a vice president or president saying something similar to any other American ethnic group.\nThe Constitution, which the vice president is sworn to uphold, guarantees to American citizens the \u201cBlessings of Liberty\u201d and equal protection of the law.\nTo the Irish, say, long the victim of subjugation in their homeland and persecution and discrimination in the United States.\nYou understand in your bones that no matter how hospitable, no matter how consequential, no matter how engaged, no matter how deeply involved you are in the United States \u2026 there\u2019s only one guarantee.\nDespite that, despite \u201chow deeply involved\u201d Jews \u201care in the United States,\u201d the occupant of the second-highest office in the land believes that American Jews should look to a foreign government as the foundation of their rights and security."}
