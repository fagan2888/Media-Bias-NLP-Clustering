(AP) - The Rowan County clerk at the center of a conflict over same-sex marriage and religious conscience closed her office on Saturday ahead of a rally protesting her refusal to issue marriage licenses.\n\nThe protest comes a day after Kim Davis asked the U.S. Supreme Court to grant her \u201casylum for her conscience.\u201d\n\nDavis stopped issuing all marriage licenses after the Supreme Court\u2019s June ruling in favor of same-sex marriage. Four couples have sued, saying Davis must fulfill her duties as an elected official regardless of her personal belief that gay marriage is sinful.\n\nA few dozen people showed up on Saturday to protest Davis\u2019 ongoing refusal to issue marriage licenses. They included a couple who said they are a woman and transgender man who got their marriage license from Davis in February.\n\nProtester Mary Hargis told the crowd Camryn and Lexie Colen had been reluctant to come forward but decided to do so to help the cause. The couple did not tell Davis that one of them was transgender when they went to request a license, Hargis said.\n\n\u201cShe just saw a straight couple in love,\u201d Camryn Colen told the crowd, picking up the story. \u201cShe should see everybody like that.\u201d\n\nThe county clerk\u2019s office regularly opens for a half day on the last Saturday of the month. A note on the door of the office did not explain the closure, but asked those who were inconvenienced to put their names on a list.\n\nMorehead resident Sarah Lindsey had come to renew her car tags and said she was \u201creally annoyed.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s supposed to have a service,\u201d Lindsey said of Davis. \u201cI pay taxes, a lot of them.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t just decide to close my office. I would get fired.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Rowan County clerk at the center of a conflict over same-sex marriage and religious conscience closed her office on Saturday ahead of a rally protesting her refusal to issue marriage licenses.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The Rowan County clerk at the center of a conflict over same-sex marriage and religious conscience closed her office on Saturday ahead of a rally protesting her refusal to issue marriage licenses.", "title": "Rowan County clerk closes office ahead of gay rights protest", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/29/rowan-county-clerk-closes-office-ahead-of-gay-righ/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/29/bb63d101cc427f26800f6a70670032e9.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/29/bb63d101cc427f26800f6a70670032e9.jpg", "description": "The Rowan County clerk at the center of a conflict over same-sex marriage and religious conscience closed her office on Saturday ahead of a rally protesting her refusal to issue marriage licenses.", "card": "summary", "title": "Rowan County clerk closes office ahead of gay rights protest"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "A few dozen people showed up on Saturday to protest Davis\u2019 ongoing refusal to issue marriage licenses.\nMOREHEAD, Ky.
