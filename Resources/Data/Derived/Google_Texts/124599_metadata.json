There are currently 13 state-run exchanges, and state leaders are citing budgetary concerns, as federal subsidies are set to run out next year.\n\n\u201cWhat is happening is states are figuring out the money is running out,\u201d Jim Wadleigh, who runs the state exchange in Connecticut told The Hill. \u201cAt the end of 2016, everyone has to be self-sustaining.\u201d\n\nIn lieu of a full merger, some are said to be considering multi-state exchanges. The so-called \u201cshared marketplace\u201d option is drawn from an obscure clause in the Affordable Care Act.\n\nIf state exchanges are not financially self-sufficient by 2016, they will be forced to join the federal system, accessible via HealthCare.gov.\n\nOthers believe a case currently before the U.S. Supreme Court, King v. Burwell, is driving merger talks. The court is expected to decide whether federal subsidies to help low-income families afford insurance are legal in states that opted not to create their own exchanges.\n\n\u201cIf the court rules against the Obama administration, millions of people in states across the country will lose subsidies,\u201d Sara Ferris wrote for The Hill.\n\nH/T: The Hill", "article_metadata": {"description": "If state exchanges are not financially self-sufficient by 2016, they will be forced to join the federal system, accessible via HealthCare.gov.", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "og": {"site_name": "Blue Nation Review", "description": "If state exchanges are not financially self-sufficient by 2016, they will be forced to join the federal system, accessible via HealthCare.gov.", "title": "States Consider Merging Obamacare Exchanges as SCOTUS Ruling Looms", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://bluenationreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/ObamacareSCOTUS.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-05-22T13:40:04-04:00", "url": "http://bluenationreview.com/states-consider-merging-obamacare-exchanges-as-scotus-ruling-looms/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Blue Nation Review", "description": "If state exchanges are not financially self-sufficient by 2016, they will be forced to join the federal system, accessible via HealthCare.gov.", "title": "States Consider Merging Obamacare Exchanges as SCOTUS Ruling Looms", "image": {"src": "http://bluenationreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/ObamacareSCOTUS.jpg"}, "creator": "@goldietaylor", "site": "@bluenationrev", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Blue Nation", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/bluenationreview", "section": "Economy", "tag": "ACA,exchanges,Goldie Taylor,health care,King v Burwell,obamacare,Supreme Court", "published_time": "2015-05-22T13:39:40-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-22T13:40:04-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2ac5\"", "article_summary": "Several states are mulling the possibility of merging their healthcare exchanges under the federal program, according to a report from The Hill.\nThere are currently 13 state-run exchanges, and state leaders are citing budgetary concerns, as federal subsidies are set to run out next year.\nIf state exchanges are not financially self-sufficient by 2016, they will be forced to join the federal system, accessible via HealthCare.gov.\nThe court is expected to decide whether federal subsidies to help low-income families afford insurance are legal in states that opted not to create their own exchanges.\n\u201cAt the end of 2016, everyone has to be self-sustaining.\u201dIn lieu of a full merger, some are said to be considering multi-state exchanges."}
