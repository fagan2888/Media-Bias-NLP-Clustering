A Scott County woman is dead after being run over by a truck in the driveway of her home.

Deputies were called to the scene Friday night on Conehatta Road near Lake.

Coroner Joe Bradford identified the victim as 45-year old Robbie Stroud.

Stroud suffered multiple injuries and was pronounced dead at the scene.

Officials said her ex-boyfriend, who has not been identified, dropped her off at her home then ran over her with his vehicle.

Investigators are trying to determine if the incident was intentional or accidental.
