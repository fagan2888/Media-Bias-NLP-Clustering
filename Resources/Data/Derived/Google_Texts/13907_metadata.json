Jerry Brown made brief mention of health care issues at his Jan. 21 State of the State Address. Unsurprisingly, the Governor leaned towards fiscal restraint for new social programs, pondering funding uncertainties for existing programs in Medi-Cal.\n\nTowards the ends of his remarks, Gov. Brown encouraged both Democrats and Republicans alike to support the \u201cnewly revised MCO financing reform,\u201d reiterating that this does not represent a tax increase.\n\nReview his thoughts on health care below:\n\nMost importantly \u2013 and this is truly monumental \u2013 we have wholeheartedly embraced the Affordable Care Act. As a result, we are now enrolling 13.5 million Californians in Medi-Cal and another 1.5 million in Covered California. This is an historic achievement. It will provide health security to so many who could not otherwise afford it. Another area where we are leading the nation is how we provide health services to people in their own homes and, in the process, give jobs to their providers. Over the past two years, we have expanded this In-Home Supportive Services program by serving more recipients, giving current recipients more hours of care and by giving \u2013 for the first time \u2013 overtime pay to those workers who provide the services. While the benefits of these programs are enormous, so too are the costs \u2013 both now and into the future. In four years, total Medi-Cal costs have grown by $23 billion. As the state begins to pay for its share of the millions of new enrollees, the cost to the General Fund will also rise. In 2012, the General Fund paid $15 billion for Medi-Cal, but by 2019, that number is expected to be $25 billion, an increase of two-thirds. For In-Home Supportive Services, in just two years, total spending will jump by $2 billion \u2013 to $9.2 billion \u2013 a 28 percent increase. As the economic recovery reaches its end point and turns downward, it is crucial that we honestly face and plan for these increased costs. In this regard, I ask you \u2013 Republicans and Democrats alike \u2013 to seriously consider the newly revised MCO financing reform. Other states have taken advantage of this federal program and California should not shortchange itself. This is not a tax increase, no matter what anyone tells you. The arithmetic is simple: California comes out a clear winner.\n\nRead the Governor\u2019s full State of the State address.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "State of Reform", "description": "California\u2019s Gov.
