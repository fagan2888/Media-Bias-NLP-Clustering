While some believe the U.S. threat to bomb Syria is still imminent if Mr. Assad fails to comply, many analysts believe the deal could only have been reached if the administration agreed to back off its threats and go to the United Nations Security Council to resolve future issues.\n\n\u201cAmerica has come around to legitimizing Assad now, because the position they used to maintain, which was that Assad has to go but we want political negotiations, was a nonstarter,\u201d says Joshua Landis, a leading Syria analyst who heads the Center for Middle East Studies at the University of Oklahoma.\n\nSEE ALSO: US, Russia reach deal on Syria chemical weapons\n\n\u201cHow do you negotiate with somebody when you\u2019re also saying to them, \u2018We want your head?\u2019\u201d Mr. Landis said.\n\nThe administration\u2019s shift\n\nDespite the recent threats of a U.S. strike, Mr. Landis contends the Obama administration\u2019s long-term view on Mr. Assad\u2019s future has actually been shifting \u2014 albeit quietly \u2014 for the past several months.\n\nPHOTOS: See how Assad is cleaning Obama's clock on Syria\n\nHe pointed to a July 18 White House briefing in which administration spokesman Jay Carney said that Mr. Assad \u201cwill never rule all of Syria again.\u201d The statement, Mr. Landis said, exposed how open the administration has come to the \u201cunstated goal\u201d of bringing about an eventual \u201cpartition of Syria in which the rebels get the north of the country and Assad gets control of as much as he can hang on to.\u201d\n\nWhile this weekend\u2019s deal may pave the way for such a political solution to Syria\u2019s violent war, more conservative analysts have raised concerns that partitioning is a risky concession.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s put State Department spin aside: Assad\u2019s rhetoric and behavior alone now shows that he believes he is in the driver\u2019s seat,\u201d said Michael Rubin, a resident scholar focused on Middle East issues at the conservative American Enterprise Institute.\n\nAdvantage Assad?\n\nRecent days saw the Syrian president acknowledge the existence of his chemical weapons program for the first time and agree to sign the international Chemical Weapons Convention.\n\nHowever, heading into the weekend, Mr. Assad was also cited by several Western news organizations as having warned that he would not give up his weapons unless the United States dropped its threats to conduct a military strike on Syria and agreed to stop supporting forces fighting for his ouster.\n\nAccording to Mr. Rubin, a central danger going forward involves the possibility that Mr. Assad and his Russian supporters are engaged in a diplomatic gambit to outmaneuver the United States.\n\n\u201cAmericans see diplomacy as a means of conflict resolution, but Russia often uses diplomacy as part of an asymmetric warfare strategy. The deal to which Kerry agreed won\u2019t resolve Syria\u2019s chemical arsenal; rather, it will let it disburse them and restock its arsenal,\u201d he said, speaking of Secretary of State John F. Kerry.\n\nWhether such a prediction is true is likely to depend on the how successful the Obama administration is at working with the Russians to achieve the timeline and goals hammered out by Mr. Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.\n\nSyria has one week\n\nAccording to a copy circulated by the State Department, Syria is expected to \u201csubmit, within a week, a comprehensive listing, including names, types, and quantities of its chemical weapons agents, types of munitions, and location and form of storage, production, and research and development facilities.\u201d\n\nThe pursuit of such information so quickly may be ambitious, particularly since prior to recent days, Mr. Assad had refused to admit to the international community that his government was even in possession of such weapons.\n\nWhile there was suspicion about the Russian motivations behind the deal, some observers said Moscow would not have agreed to such parameters without confidence that Mr. Assad will comply.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe that the Russians are doing this unless Assad is at least nodding his head,\u201d said Mr. Landis. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what America is counting on, that Russia is going to want to look like a powerful player here and that means that they can get their allies to deliver.\u201d\n\nThe agreement, meanwhile, calls for the complete \u201cremoval and destruction\u201d of Syria\u2019s chemical weapons by the \u201cfirst half of 2014.\u201d\n\nIt remains to be seen how international weapons inspectors will achieve the objective, since it will require them to expediently navigate the very volatile landscape of a civil war that has been raging inside Syria over the past two years.\n\nIn addition to the alleged use of chemical weapons by forces loyal to Mr. Assad last month, the conflict has resulted in more than 100,000 deaths.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The U.S.-Russia agreement to compel Syria to account for and destroy its chemical weapons completes what foreign policy insiders say is a dangerous about-face by the Obama administration \u2014 flipping from demanding Syrian President Bashar Assad's resignation to now legitimizing him as the lynchpin player in a tenuous deal.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The U.S.-Russia agreement to compel Syria to account for and destroy its chemical weapons completes what foreign policy insiders say is a dangerous about-face by the Obama administration \u2014 flipping from demanding Syrian President Bashar Assad\u2019s resignation to now legitimizing him as the lynchpin player in a tenuous deal.", "title": "ANALYSIS: Deal with Russians legitimizes Assad; raises prospect of partitioning Syria", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/sep/14/analysis-deal-russians-legitimizes-assad-raises-pr/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/05/20/assad20.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/05/20/assad20.jpg", "description": "The U.S.-Russia agreement to compel Syria to account for and destroy its chemical weapons completes what foreign policy insiders say is a dangerous about-face by the Obama administration \u2014 flipping fr", "card": "summary", "title": "ANALYSIS: Deal with Russians legitimizes Assad; raises prospect of par"}, "Author": "Guy Taylor", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "War Conflict, Politics, Bashar Al Assad, Syria, Russia"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd12ba\"", "article_summary": "Recent days saw the Syrian president acknowledge the existence of his chemical weapons program for the first time and agree to sign the international Chemical Weapons Convention.\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe that the Russians are doing this unless Assad is at least nodding his head,\u201d said Mr. Landis.\nIn addition to the alleged use of chemical weapons by forces loyal to Mr. Assad last month, the conflict has resulted in more than 100,000 deaths.\nSEE ALSO: US, Russia reach deal on Syria chemical weapons\u201cHow do you negotiate with somebody when you\u2019re also saying to them, \u2018We want your head?\u2019\u201d Mr. Landis said.\nThe administration\u2019s shiftDespite the recent threats of a U.S. strike, Mr. Landis contends the Obama administration\u2019s long-term view on Mr. Assad\u2019s future has actually been shifting \u2014 albeit quietly \u2014 for the past several months."}
