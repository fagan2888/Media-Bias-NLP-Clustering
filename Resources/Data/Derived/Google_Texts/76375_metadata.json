Taking a page from Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, Reynolds rhetorically asked if it\u2019s simply a version of Obamacare for 401(k)s.\n\nCalling the rule \u201cmassively complex\u201d and comparing its length to \u201cWar and Peace,\u201d he claimed the DOL\u2019s proposal is so unwieldy and costly that \u201cit would do far more damage to working Americans\u2019 retirement security than any of the abuses it aims to correct.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs drafted, it would severely limit access to routine investment advice for tens of millions of retirement savers,\u201d Reynolds argued. \u201cIt would also make it nearly impossible for service providers to present investment advice and options to businesses with less than 100 employees.\n\n\u201cThe effect, if not the intent, would be to stymie the growth of the workplace savings system \u2013 period. Virtually all new businesses, after all, start with fewer than 100 workers. Twelve years ago this month, Facebook had five.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll that is bad enough,\u201d he said, before teasing, \u201cBut wait \u2013 there\u2019s more.\u201d\n\nHe then noted that at the behest of the White House, the Labor Department is also advancing a plan for state governments to offer state-mandated Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) for private workers. The plans would be exempt from the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA).\n\nBut Congress\u2019s failure\u2014so far\u2014to close the 401(k) coverage gap \u201cis no justification for proliferating what may be dozens of state savings arrangements, free from the protections that ERISA mandates and free also to compete unfairly with private plans that meet those higher standards.\n\n\u201cTaken together, the DOL\u2019s twin rule-making efforts promises to have impacts as sweeping as any major piece of pension law in decades,\u201d Reynolds concluded. \u201cBut these profound changes \u2013 which could never survive democratic debate and passage through Congress\u2014are being enacted through a complex, \u2018black box\u2019 bureaucratic process \u2013 leaving Congress as almost a by-stander.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bob Reynolds, the high-profile CEO of Putman Investments and Great-West Financial, criticizes the Department of Labor\u2019s proposed fiduciary rule.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "The 401(k) Specialist", "description": "Bob Reynolds, the high-profile CEO of Putman Investments and Great-West Financial, criticizes the Department of Labor\u2019s proposed fiduciary rule.", "title": "\u2018Obamacare for the 401(k) World?\u2019 Putnam CEO Reynolds - The 401(k) Specialist", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://401kspecialistmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/dreamstime_s_29051884.jpg", "height": 555}, "updated_time": "2016-03-29T16:35:37-04:00", "url": "http://401kspecialistmag.com/obamacare-401k-world-putnam-ceo-reynolds/", "type": "article"}, "robots": "noodp", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://401kspecialistmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cropped-401k-logo-270x270.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/401kSpecialist", "section": "401(k) News", "tag": "Putnam Investments", "published_time": "2016-03-23T21:47:45-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-29T16:35:37-04:00"}, "google-site-verification": "3aPn9AF5kRWe6YqJV5amTSeD9gMpl1WJ6C22Qr_LOKg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "putnam investments, great west financial, 401(k) plan, 40(k) fiduciary, department of labor, business, companies, economy, industry, markets, headlines, nation, politics, science, technology"}, "article_summary": "Bob Reynolds, the high-profile CEO of Putman Investments and Great-West Financial, took to the pages of The Hill to decry the proposed rule.\nA common theme is emerging in the language critics are using to slam the DOL\u2019s fiduciary rule.\n\u201cTaken together, the DOL\u2019s twin rule-making efforts promises to have impacts as sweeping as any major piece of pension law in decades,\u201d Reynolds concluded.\nThe plans would be exempt from the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA).\n\u201cThe effect, if not the intent, would be to stymie the growth of the workplace savings system \u2013 period."}
