Sierra is living at the motel, which is being used as temporary housing for the family. (Michael S. Williamson/The Washington Post)\n\nAndre Foster and Shamicka Oliver liken their tiny motel room to a prison. They sleep, along with three of their kids, on two beds. They eat their meals on the beds, too, Styrofoam cartons laid open, curtains drawn. The guards tell them to keep their kids inside. And every night, around 9 p.m., the guards come by to count heads. \u00b6 \u201cThe kids have to stand up for the count,\u201d Foster said on a recent afternoon while the three kids \u2014 ages 10, 8 and 2 \u2014 huddled on a bed watching TV. \u201cIt\u2019s not healthy,\u201d he added. \u201cMentally, physically or spiritually.\u201d \u00b6 Four months ago, life was not like this. Two parents, four kids and the children\u2019s \u00adgreat-grandmother lived under one roof in a three-bedroom apartment in Southeast Washington. The oldest daughter, 13, was about to graduate from middle school. The family was happy, even if Foster and Oliver\u2019s janitorial jobs and food stamps carried them only as far as the next month\u2019s rent. \u00b6 But the family\u2019s fortunes turned on a single night, when an upstairs neighbor\u2019s boyfriend set fire to the entire building during a domestic dispute. \u00b6 Since taking office in January, D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) has pledged $145 million to build more affordable housing and combat an enduring homelessness crisis that has bedeviled the nation\u2019s capital for years. But Foster and Oliver\u2019s desperate journey illustrates how entrenched the problem remains.\n\nTheir story is also a testament to how easy it is to fall into homelessness in a city that has seen rapidly rising costs and a growing gap between rich and poor. Even in summer, when shelter beds tend to free up and the threat of hypothermia disappears, and even in a city where addressing homelessness is a top priority, it can still take months for a working family to find a temporary place to live \u2014 let alone a permanent home.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not from not paying your bills, or not having structure in your life or doing drugs,\u201d said Foster, who continues to view the situation as a bad dream. \u201cWe\u2019re people who are actually going to work every day, paying our taxes, trying to take care of our family.\u201d\n\n\u2018I was so desperate\u2019\n\nFor Foster and Oliver, the nightmare started late April 4, when they awoke and saw smoke engulfing their three-bedroom apartment. In a panic, the parents scrambled to lift their four children and Oliver\u2019s elderly grandmother out of a ground-floor window to safety.\n\nThe three other families in the building already had government rent assistance through Section 8 housing, Foster said, and that helped them find new shelter after the fire. That Foster\u2019s family was paying market rate rent ironically made finding a new home more difficult, according to the couple.\n\nAndre Foster is frustrated with the conditions he and his family live in as they stay at the Days Inn. The family lost its home in a fire and have been housed by the city at the motel. (Michael S. Williamson/The Washington Post)\n\nIn the aftermath, it was the Red Cross, not the city, that first came to their aid, picking them up and placing them in a hotel for three days.\n\nThen the District\u2019s Office of the Tenant Advocate swept in, covering an additional two weeks at the hotel, the couple said. And then the District\u2019s Crime Victims Compensation Program gave the family a few thousand dollars to cover three more weeks at a $200-a-night hotel on New York Avenue NE, Foster said.\n\nThe couple had sent their oldest daughter and Oliver\u2019s grandmother to stay with Oliver\u2019s mother. Her one-bedroom apartment couldn\u2019t accommodate any more people, and when the hotel money ran out, the family panicked.\n\nWhat followed: two months of phone calls, paperwork and bus trips to and from the District\u2019s central intake center for homeless families at the Virginia Williams Family Resource Center. They also traveled to the city\u2019s troubled emergency shelter for homeless families at the old D.C. General Hospital, where Oliver and Foster pleaded for a space to house themselves and their children.\n\nThey called LaRuby May, their new Ward 8 council member, repeatedly. They bombarded one of the mayor\u2019s community outreach specialists with calls, too.\n\nAll of it amounted to what Foster and Oliver described in frustration as city officials giving them \u201cthe runaround.\u201d\n\nAt Virginia Williams, an official told Oliver that they couldn\u2019t place the family because the weather wasn\u2019t cold enough, Oliver said. Then she was told to find a relative to take the kids off her hands so that she and Foster could stay in a shelter for adults.\n\nSierra Oliver, 2, eats in the lobby at the Days Inn motel. (Michael S. Williamson/The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cAnd then one day [the official] told me to go out and find a shelter that would take me, just take my paperwork. So I was so desperate, I went to D.C. General,\u201d Oliver said.\n\nD.C. General told her she needed a referral, and Oliver returned to Virginia Williams in dismay.\n\nIn the meantime, Foster said he had to give up his job to take care of the kids during the day, and for three weeks the couple slept on the streets, 2-year-old Sierra sometimes sleeping with them; the others crowded temporarily into the cramped apartment with Oliver\u2019s mother.\n\n\u201cI never thought that it would be so hard for working families in D.C. to have to go to this extreme to find housing and have to sleep on the street,\u201d Foster said. \u201cThey say they have all these resources. But these resources aren\u2019t working.\u201d\n\nArduous placement process\n\nDora Taylor, a spokeswoman for the Department of Human Services, which manages the city\u2019s homeless services, said families that show up at Virginia Williams submit first to an assessment to determine \u201cthe level of need.\u201d\n\nAn automated message at the center instructs families to bring picture IDs, Social Security cards, birth certificates and \u201cproof of homelessness\u201d to the assessment.\n\n\u201cShelter is often not the most effective intervention for families, and every effort is made to divert families from shelter by securing a safe, stable and appropriate housing situation \u2014 often with family members and friends \u2014 in addition to providing other supports and services to help the family achieve and maintain stability in housing,\u201d Taylor said.\n\nIf a delay occurs, it could be because officials say that a family has an alternative place to stay, she said.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until June 26, 83 days after they lost their home in the fire, when the family finally caught a break. The city placed the family in a room at a Days Inn on a busy stretch of highway near the city\u2019s far northeast border.\n\nThe family says that the breakthrough came as the result of Oliver\u2019s tearful final phone call to the mayor\u2019s Ward 8 outreach specialist, Markus Batchelor \u2014 not from navigating the District\u2019s bureaucracy.\n\nBatchelor did not respond to phone messages.\n\nThe motel was already crowded with homeless families; according to city officials, 305 of the District\u2019s 671 homeless families reside in motels, although Taylor would not say which ones. And some of the homeless residents at the Days Inn told the couple that they had been there for more than a year.\n\nThe District has amplified its security protocol for homeless families since a girl disappeared from D.C. General last year. At the Days Inn, it means that guards come around for a head count every night and families have to get permission for any of their children to spend the night elsewhere.\n\n\u2018I never knew it was this bad\u2019\n\nTaylor confirmed that department staffers conduct \u201ccurfew checks on a nightly basis\u201d as well as hourly rounds at the motels from 5:30 p.m. to 8 a.m. every day.\n\n\u201cChildren are expected to stay in shelter nightly unless otherwise approved by a case manager,\u201d she said. And families are \u201cencouraged to limit visitors to court-appointed service providers or case managers.\u201d\n\nA Washington Post photographer who tried to accompany Foster to the family\u2019s room recently was turned away by guards.\n\nGuards have also prohibited the children from playing outside, the couple and neighboring families said.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t keep your kids cooped up in the hotel room all day long,\u201d Foster said. There is no outlet here for them \u2014 nothing \u201cto take their minds off of the environment that they\u2019re in.\u201d\n\nA few doors down, Tiffany Phifer tried to keep order as her five children bounced around another room with two beds where the lamp shades were off-kilter and the TV blared in the middle of the day. She said they had been there since November.\n\nOliver said she has grown deeply depressed since the start of the family\u2019s ordeal. She also worries about safety. In their first four nights, she said, the police came twice \u2014 once because \u201ca girl got beat up\u201d in the parking lot. D.C. police confirmed that they responded five times during that period for various incidents, including two reported assaults, one domestic disturbance and a report of gunfire.\n\nThe couple worry about their children, who have trouble sleeping together in one bed, and they question whether the motel is violating the fire code by having so many people in one room.\n\nLast month, they struggled to scrounge up the funds to buy their oldest daughter a graduation dress and a trip to her \u00admiddle-school prom so that she wouldn\u2019t \u201cfeel embarrassed about the situation,\u201d Oliver said.\n\nShe and Foster said the 13-year-old has taken the instability the hardest. \u201cThat\u2019s why I didn\u2019t bring her here yet,\u201d Oliver said as the three younger children sat on the beds on a recent afternoon, picking through the spaghetti and meatballs that had been provided through the homeless program.\n\nThey said the city had promised employment counseling and other help so they could get out. They are still waiting for it to come.\n\n\u201cI never knew it was this bad,\u201d Oliver said. \u201cA lot of people don\u2019t look at it until they\u2019re in it \u2014 it\u2019s sad to say \u2014 but there are a lot of people who are homeless.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "dcpolitics, d.c. politics, homelessness, d.c. homeless", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "A fire cost the family its independence and set it on a frightening journey to find shelter.", "title": "How a family of six lost their home and struggled to find a new one", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/from-independence-to-a-homeless-prison--overnight/2015/07/11/5404cab0-203e-11e5-84d5-eb37ee8eaa61_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/07/09/Others/Images/2015-07-09/SummerHomeless031436483231.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@ahauslohner"}, "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "dcpolitics, d.c. politics, homelessness, d.c. homeless", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "eomportal-uuid": "5404cab0-203e-11e5-84d5-eb37ee8eaa61", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "description": "A fire cost the family its independence and set it on a frightening journey to find shelter."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc2de\"", "article_summary": "The family lost its home in a fire and have been housed by the city at the motel.\nIt wasn\u2019t until June 26, 83 days after they lost their home in the fire, when the family finally caught a break.\nThe District has amplified its security protocol for homeless families since a girl disappeared from D.C.
