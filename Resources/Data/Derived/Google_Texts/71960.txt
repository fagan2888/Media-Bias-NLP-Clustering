Marla Gilcrease needed to get her appendix removed. She signed up for health insurance in late December, and was able to proceed with an appendectomy within a month, in January of this year.



"I can't imagine what it would have been like without coverage and what my cost would be now," Gilcrease said.



Sunday is the deadline to get health insurance for 2015 under the Affordable Care Act, which is also known as Obamacare. The Christus Schumpert Medical Center held a sign-up "blitz" Friday and Saturday, and will again Sunday.



But beyond saving money, Gilcrease says she now has peace of mind.



"The thought of not having any insurance frightens someone in their 50s, because you never know. There's all kinds of things that start to wear out once you get a little older," Gilcrease said.
