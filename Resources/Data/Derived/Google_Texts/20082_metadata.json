Under the amendment, only those defense contractors that have been debarred or otherwise suspended for violating federal labor laws would be subject to what business groups have dubbed the \u201cblacklisting\u201d rule. The House passed an its own version of the NDAA last week with a provision that would block the rule entirely for Defense Department and National Security Administration contractors.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nIn addition, Sen. Jerry Moran (R-KS) has pre-filed an amendment to the NDAA that would bar the NLRB from asserting jurisdiction over the Native American governmental employers that control the majority of Indian-owned casinos in the United States. The House passed stand-alone legislation that does the same thing. House Republicans last week also passed an amendment potentially shielding religious groups from an executive order that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. The Obama administration opposed that provision, and the provision on the \u201cblacklisting rule,\u201d in an administrative statement last week.\n\nAlso for your legislative radar: A bipartisan deal to end Puerto Rico\u2019s debt crisis will go through markup in the House and Senate this week. Although several key Democrats, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), last week praised the compromise, major unions oppose it because it reduces the minimum wage and overtime protections. The House Natural Resources Committee will make opening statements on the markup at 5 p.m. Tuesday, with full markup on Wednesday starting at 10 a.m.\n\nGOOD MORNING.

Fight for $15 organizers will soon vote to affiliate formally with SEIU, although they won\u2019t be paying union dues, according to Buzzfeed\u2019s Cora Lewis. \u201cWe have never let an outdated labor law stand in the way of workers being able to stand together,\u201d SEIU President Mary Kay Henry told BuzzFeed. \u201cWe did it 90 years ago for janitors, 40 years ago with every public employee, and 15 years ago for home care workers.\u201d http://bzfd.it/1Tt03O2\n\n\u2014 Henry reelected: Henry ran uncontested, winning her second full term. Former executive vice president Gerry Hudson was elected as International Secretary-Treasurer, replacing Mike Fishman, who is retiring after more than 30 years in the labor movement. Full release from SEIU here: http://bit.ly/1TxwInI\n\nWatch Henry\u2019s convention speech here: http://bit.ly/1TCY2Cg\n\n\u2014Core principles: The union also committed to three core commitments: finding news ways for workers to organize and exercise collective power; building a broader movement; and innovating within the union.\n\nASSESSING OVERTIME BLOWBACK: POLITICO\u2019S Marianne LeVine weighs predictions from opponents of the overtime rule that it will harm workers. Will employers convert salaried employees into hourly ones? Maybe, but \u201cworkers are much more concerned with how much they\u2019re getting paid than some perceived status,\u201d says former Deputy Secretary of Labor Seth Harris. What about flexibility? A 2014 study by the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute found that salaried workers in the group newly eligible for overtime \u201cdon\u2019t have noticeably greater levels of work flexibility that they would \u2018lose\u2019 if they became more like their hourly counterparts.\u201d\n\nThe threat of lost health insurance and pensions is more serious, LeVine writes. But firms with more than 50 employees are required already under the Affordable Care Act either to provide health insurance or to contribute toward its purchase. Firms with fewer than 50 employees are not, but only 35 percent of these provide health insurance. As for employer-sponsored pensions, only 38 percent of the newly eligible group are enrolled in any.

Union and company officials bargained at the Labor Department in Washington, D.C. last week, agreeing to a media blackout. Buzzfeed\u2019s Cora Lewis reports on Verizon\u2019s elaborate replacement worker training center in Leesburg, Va., where the company quickly trains temp workers for deployment to areas where permanent workers are on strike.\n\n\u201cThe facility in Leesburg,\u201d Lewis writes, \u201cis proof of that investment and highlights the current corporate approach to battling organized labor: an all-inclusive spring break in the woods for mid-level management and picket-crossers to learn skills and hobnob (face-time with Senior Vice Presidents included), far removed from the front-lines of workplaces and the strikers themselves.\u201d http://bzfd.it/1U6HdM0\n\nDEADLOCKED FEC DROPS MURRAY COERCION COMPLAINT: The Federal Election Commission will not investigate coal magnate Robert Murray, his company, or the company's PAC, after the six commissioners deadlocked on a 2012 coercion complaint. In a statement released Friday, three of the commissioners \u2014 two Democrats and an independent \u2014 wrote that they could not attract a fourth vote from one of the three Republican commissioners to investigate allegations that Murray pressured employees to make political contributions to favored candidates.\n\nThe FEC's Office of General Counsel concluded in February that there was evidence sufficient for the commissioners to vote to investigate. But Murray is active in the Republican Party, and he\u2019s on the hosting committee for July\u2019s convention in Cleveland, and his company downplayed the allegations. The FEC came to a similar deadlock last summer on complaints that Murray forced miners to attend a rally for Mitt Romney in 2012.\n\nNLRB UPDATE\n\n\u2014 D.C. CIRC. REJECTS CHALLENGE TO INFO REQUEST: A D.C. Circuit panel rejected a challenge from IronTiger Logistics to overrule an NLRB policy that requires employers to fulfill a union\u2019s request for information so long as the information requested is \u201cpresumptively relevant\u201d to bargaining. While denying the broad challenge, the court remanded the case, requesting a demonstration that the information at issue was \u201cpresumptively relevant.\u201d Decision here: http://1.usa.gov/259GPo7\n\n\u2014 D.C. CIRC. REVERSED BOARD IN UNION THREATS CASE: Also Friday, the D.C. Circuit held that the NLRB wrongly certified a LiUNA local election at the Pennsylvania nursing company ManorCare of Kingston. The court held that the board downplayed several threats of violence from third parties in the case. \u201cWe conclude that the board abused its discretion here by finding that the threats did not create a \u2018general atmosphere of fear and reprisal\u2019 according to the Board\u2019s own precedent,\u201d the decision said. http://1.usa.gov/1OHnOjt\n\n\u2014 COURT NIXES ATTORNEY FEES AWARD: In yet another NLRB-related case Friday, the D.C. Circuit upheld a requirement that the HTH Corporation read a notice informing employees that it had violated the NLRA. The court, however, vacated an order requiring the company to pay attorney\u2019s fees to the union in the case. Full opinion here: http://1.usa.gov/1TPtLfR\n\n\u2014 COMPANY WINS FEE BID AGAINST BOARD: From BNA\u2019s Larry Dube: \u201cThe National Labor Relations Board was not justified in pursuing a preliminary injunction against a nursing home and must pay the employer's attorneys' fees, a federal district court in Alabama has ruled. The decision is a reminder that smaller organizations that prevail in litigation against the NLRB may have a right under federal law to seek reimbursement for their legal expenses.\u201d Full decision here: http://bit.ly/1Ri6pNU\n\n\u2014NLRB FILES COMPLAINT AGAINST DOD FOOD CONTRACTOR: The NLRB has filed a complaint against the Defense Department food contractor Seven Hills, alleging the company threatened and fired workers for organizing activity with the advocacy group Good Jobs Nation. Complaint here: http://bit.ly/1TsCLI2\n\nNEW RIGHT-TO-WORK LAWSUIT IN WISCONSIN: Two International Union of Operating Engineers locals filed a federal court lawsuit seeking to invalidate Wisconsin\u2019s new right-to-work law.\n\nThe new suit claims that the law regulates concerted activities that are protected by the NLRA. It also argues that it violates civil rights by interfering \u201cwith the free play of economic forces in collective bargaining over a mandatory bargaining subject, and because it attempts to regulate a subject of collective bargaining that Congress intended to leave for the parties to negotiate, free of state regulation.\"\n\nIt comes more than one month after a Wisconsin state court invalidated Gov. Scott Walker\u2019s right-to-work law, a decision likely to be reversed on appeal.
