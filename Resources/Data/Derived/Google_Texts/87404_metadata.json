His replacement policies would only cover 5% of those who lost coverage following repeal.\n\nThe proposal to block grant Medicaid could see significant savings, depending on how it\u2019s designed. However, Trump hasn\u2019t provided information yet on the size of those grants, according to the report. The CRFB asked Trump to outline additional policies to pay for his plan.\n\nMeanwhile, Bernie Sanders\u2019 proposed all-payer system could have unintended consequences, since the insurance industry accounts for about one-fifth of the national economy, The Washington Post reported. Socializing healthcare could dampen economic growth and cause hundreds of thousands of people in the industry to lose their jobs, experts say.\n\nSanders has yet to offer details on how his plan would look.\n\nRecommended Reading\n\nThe Times-Picayune: Trump health care plan would increase uninsured by 21 million, study finds\n\nThe Los Angeles Times: Trump health plan would increase deficit and leave millions uninsured, report says\n\nMorning Consult: Donald Trump\u2019s Health Care Plan Would Increase Deficit, Uninsured\n\nThe Washington Post: The many mysteries surrounding Bernie Sanders\u2019s single-payer health care plan", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Meg Bryant", "twitter": {"domain": "Healthcare Dive", "site": "@healthcaredive", "card": "summary"}, "featured": "False", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/cache/c6/0d/c60dd4193a9992211264029ec9ef272f.jpg", "sailthru.tags": "healthcare,type-newspost,healthcare-health-law,healthcare-policy-reg", "news_keywords": "Health Law,Policy & Regulation,Policy & Reg", "category": "News Post", "title": "Trump, Sanders health plans come under fire", "pub_date": "mar 16, 2016", "section": "news", "sailthru.date": "2016-03-16T20:20:53", "content_boost": 4, "touched": "True", "article_date_original": "Wednesday, March 16, 2016, 08:20 PM", "medium": "news", "description": "Healthcare", "sailthru.expire_date": "2026-03-04T20:20:53", "teaser": "<p>Under Trump&rsquo;s plan, Medicaid would be transformed to a block-grant program and leave an estimated 21 million individuals uninsured.</p>", "sponsored": "False", "date": "2016-03-16", "sailthru.description": "Under Trump\u2019s plan, Medicaid would be transformed to a block-grant program and leave an estimated 21 million individuals uninsured.", "viewport": "width=986", "og": {"site_name": "Healthcare Dive", "description": "Under Trump\u2019s plan, Medicaid would be transformed to a block-grant program and leave an estimated 21 million individuals uninsured.", "title": "Trump, Sanders health plans come under fire", "url": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/news/trump-sanders-health-plans-come-under-fire/415679/", "image": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/diveimage/5440384453_4669d0096b_b.jpg", "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "aN-77CvDv8Rt4OQnHMaUSm6V87TF8ri5GDUv93p7pHk", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/cache/a9/88/a988c23ee9d781c1695737ad659d9eeb.jpg"}, "article_summary": "Recommended ReadingThe Times-Picayune: Trump health care plan would increase uninsured by 21 million, study findsThe Los Angeles Times: Trump health plan would increase deficit and leave millions uninsured, report saysMorning Consult: Donald Trump\u2019s Health Care Plan Would Increase Deficit, UninsuredThe Washington Post: The many mysteries surrounding Bernie Sanders\u2019s single-payer health care plan\nHowever, Trump hasn\u2019t provided information yet on the size of those grants, according to the report.\nDive Insight:By completely repealing Obamacare, Trump intends to also repeal all subsequent ACA \u201cregulations, subsidies, Medicaid expansion, Medicare savings, and tax increases,\u201d the report says.\nThe CRFB asked Trump to outline additional policies to pay for his plan.\nSanders has yet to offer details on how his plan would look."}
