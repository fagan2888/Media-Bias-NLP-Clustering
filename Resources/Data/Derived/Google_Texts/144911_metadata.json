Over-spending by the regional governments helped lead the country to the brink of an international bail-out at the time of the euro zone debt crisis.\n\nSince then, many of the regional governments have changed hands from the PP to coalitions between the opposition Socialists and leftist newcomer parties, making it more difficult for Madrid to enforce austerity.\n\nSpain announced a 2015 budget shortfall of 5 percent of economic output last month, missing the 4.2 percent agreed with the European Commission and prompting calls from Brussels and Washington for swift action to cut costs.\n\nOnly three of the 17 regions - the Canary Islands, the Basque Country and Galicia - met their deficit targets for 2015. Six even oversaw spending rises from the previous year.\n\nTogether the regions booked a deficit of 1.66 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2015, overshooting by one percentage point a 0.7 percent target.\n\nActing Treasury Minister Cristobal Montoro said on Friday the government would approve spending cuts worth 2 billion euros at the central government.\n\nRather than asking the regions to implement more cuts, he has asked them to maintain spending levels and use any savings from items such as lower interest rates on debt payments to pay down their deficits.\n\nHowever, regional heads have said the controls on spending are excessive and will hurt ordinary people.\n\n\"It's unrealistic, both from a social and a practical point of view,\" Oriol Junqueras, the economy head of the northeastern region of Catalonia, wrote in a letter to Montoro on Friday.\n\n(Reporting by Sonya Dowsett and Blanca Rodriguez; Editing by Mark Potter)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The task is a politically uncomfortable one for the caretaker government of the center", "title": "Spanish government pressures regions to control spending", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/16/Spanish-government-pressures-regions-control-spending", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/spain-economy_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/16/Spanish-government-pressures-regions-control-spending", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/spain-economy_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The task is a politically uncomfortable one for the caretaker government of the center", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Spain's 17 regions manage their own budgets on big ticket social spending in areas such as health and education where cuts lose votes.\nActing Treasury Minister Cristobal Montoro said on Friday the government would approve spending cuts worth 2 billion euros at the central government.\nOver-spending by the regional governments helped lead the country to the brink of an international bail-out at the time of the euro zone debt crisis.\nOnly three of the 17 regions - the Canary Islands, the Basque Country and Galicia - met their deficit targets for 2015.\nHowever, regional heads have said the controls on spending are excessive and will hurt ordinary people."}
