Employer-sponsored plans usually exempt prescription drugs from their deductibles, but they still may have stiff co-pays.\n\nAs a result, the study said, patients in the most-popular silver plans pay 46 percent of their total drug spending on average, compared to 20 percent for patients in typical employer-sponsored plans.\n\nKenneth Thorpe, the study's lead author and chair of the health policy department at Emory, said the report underscores the need for people to consider more than the premium when they compare health plans on an exchange. Health plans have been shifting more drug costs to consumers in part to hold down monthly premiums, he said. But studies have shown most people choose their health plan because it has the lowest premium.\n\n[Also: Martin Shkreli defends $750 for Daraprim pill ]\n\nThe risk of higher cost sharing for people with a chronic disease, Thorpe said, is that they won't fill or renew prescriptions, leaving them sicker and in need of costly hospital care.\n\nInsurers are required by law to offer many proven preventive services such as mammograms and colonoscopies without any cost sharing. The same should apply to prescription drugs known to prevent illnesses, such as Metformin for diabetics, Thorpe said. Health plans are shortsighted in saving money on drug costs by shifting expenses to consumers, he said. \"It's penny wise and pound foolish,\" Thorpe added.\n\nLarry Levitt, a senior vice president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, said most people buying exchange plans get subsidies to help reduce their out-of-pocket spending.\n\nLevitt also said comparing employer-sponsored plans to those sold on exchanges has limited value because employer plans typically offer more generous benefits than the silver plans in the marketplaces, and employer plans also have higher premiums.\n\nLike Healthcare Finance on Facebook\n\nSome insurance exchanges this fall plan to offer software that allows comparisons of health plans' costs based on consumers' health status. The federal government has offered that ability for private Medicare drug and health plans for over a decade.\n\nCori Uccello, a senior health fellow at the American Academy of Actuaries, said health plans are shifting more costs to policyholders to manage their increased drug spending, which is rising faster than overall medical spending.\n\nMila Kofman, executive director of the Washington, D.C., health exchange, said officials there have been watching to make sure plans are not discriminating against sicker consumers -- such as those with HIV\u2013 by putting all their drugs in the highest tier for out-of-pocket spending. Four Florida insurers agreed to lower their rates for HIV drugs after AIDS activists filed lawsuits last year accusing them of discrimination by making those drugs too expensive.\n\nKaiser Health News is a national health policy news service.
