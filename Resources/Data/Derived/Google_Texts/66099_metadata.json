Those in the group earn too much for Medicaid coverage and too little for coverage under the Affordable Care Act and can't afford high premiums on their own.\n\n\"That gap is about 100,000 folks in Bexar County,\" said George Hernandez, president and CEO of University Health System. \"That's a lot.\"\n\nDoctors say a big concern is the fact that those without insurance don't tend to get proper health care and often go to hospitals instead.\n\n\"Getting medical care only in the emergency room means that chronic conditions go untreated, with no follow-up or preventive medical attention until their next crisis visit to the emergency room,\" said Estrada.\n\nFormer Texas Gov. Rick Perry had rejected the use of federal funds for a state insurance plan, but the group believes current Gov. Greg Abbott may have a new perspective.\n\n\"We did hear remarks from our governor awhile back that he's interested in hearing about it, which is a big step above our previous governor, so we'll see if anything comes of it,\" Wolff said.\n\nThe Texas Way will be presented to lawmakers while they're in session over the next few weeks. Meanwhile, the deadline to sign up for health insurance coverage on the federal marketplace is Feb. 15.\n\nThose who don't have insurance will face financial penalties.\n\nCopyright 2015 by KSAT - All rights reserved.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://media.ksat.com/photo/2015/02/11/doctors-push-for-health-care-for-those-in-coverage-gap-0_co7lxs1b_9393_ver1.0_160_90.jpg", "sailthru.author": "Eileen Gonzales", "description": "A group of area doctors has spearheaded a push to provide health care coverage for those who fall into an insurance coverage gap.", "author": "Eileen Gonzales", "og": {"site_name": "KSAT", "description": "A group of area doctors has spearheaded a push to provide health care coverage for those who fall into an insurance coverage gap.", "title": "Doctors push for health care for those in 'coverage gap'", "url": "http://www.ksat.com/news/doctors-push-for-health-care-for-those-in-coverage-gap", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://media.ksat.com/photo/2015/02/11/doctors-push-for-health-care-for-those-in-coverage-gap-0_co7lxs1b_9393_ver1.0_1280_720.jpg", "height": 720}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "<p>A group of area doctors has spearheaded a push to provide health care coverage for those who fall into an insurance coverage gap.</p>", "title": "Doctors push for health care for those in 'coverage gap'", "url": "http://www.ksat.com/news/doctors-push-for-health-care-for-those-in-coverage-gap", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://media.ksat.com/photo/2015/02/11/doctors-push-for-health-care-for-those-in-coverage-gap-0_co7lxs1b_9393_ver1.0_1280_720.jpg", "height": 720}, "site": "@ksatnews", "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-02-11T19:01:42+0000", "sailthru.title": "Doctors push for health care for those in 'coverage gap'", "keywords": "News,News,Politics,Health", "fb": {"app_id": 362904920453016}, "article": {"section": "News", "published_time": "2015-02-11T19:01:42+0000", "modified_time": "2015-02-11T19:01:29+0000", "author": "http://www.ksat.com/author/egonzales"}, "sailthru.tags": "News,News,Politics,Health", "google-site-verification": "saKN_Rxj3pYzy5TY3_Llko_4hA3OUGCoya0vO4STuSc", "page-type": "article", "content_id": 73505179, "sailthru.description": "<p>A group of area doctors has spearheaded a push to provide health care coverage for those who fall into an insurance coverage gap.</p>", "sailthru.image.full": "http://media.ksat.com/photo/2015/02/11/doctors-push-for-health-care-for-those-in-coverage-gap-0_co7lxs1b_9393_ver1.0_1280_720.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Doctors push for health care for those in 'coverage gap'"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcec4c\"", "article_summary": "SAN ANTONIO - A group of area doctors has spearheaded a push to provide health care coverage for those who fall into an insurance coverage gap.\nMeanwhile, the deadline to sign up for health insurance coverage on the federal marketplace is Feb. 15.\nThe insurance coverage gap is a problem that strongly affects the working poor.\nDoctors say a big concern is the fact that those without insurance don't tend to get proper health care and often go to hospitals instead.\n\"That gap is about 100,000 folks in Bexar County,\" said George Hernandez, president and CEO of University Health System."}
