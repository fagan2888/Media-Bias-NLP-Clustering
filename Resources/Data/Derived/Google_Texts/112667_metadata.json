But this quality also lends the plant its appeal as a substitute for nicotine in smoking cessation. Perhaps more importantly, cytisine is incredibly cheap and even more effective than nicotine replacement patches and gums, the study found. Cytisine is an alkaloid derived from plants in the Leguminosae family, and is primarily found in the seeds of the golden rain tree, known as Cytisus Laburnum. It has often been used as a substitute for tobacco in Eastern Europe due to its ability to stimulate receptors in the brain that nicotine also affects.\n\nLed by researchers in New Zealand, the study examined 1,310 smokers who were trying to quit. Half of the participants were given cytisine as tablets, which were to be taken in diminishing doses every day for 25 days, while the other half were given regular nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) \u2014 this typically involves nicotine patches, gums, or lozenges, for two months. The authors found that people taking cytisine were actually far more successful in stopping smoking than those on NRT; after six months, 143 of the 655 cytisine patients were still abstaining from smoking while only 100 in the NRT group of 655 had remained tobacco-free.\n\nWhile this sounds promising, the authors also found that there were some side effects with the cytisine treatment, though they were quite mild. \u201cOf those people in the cytisine group experiencing a side effect, the majority said they\u2019d still recommend cytisine to someone who wanted to stop smoking,\u201d lead author of the study Natalie Walker, of the University of Auckland\u2019s National Institute for Health Innovation, told New Scientist. Side effects like nausea, vomiting, or sleep problems were minuscule in comparison to the detrimental chronic effects of long-term smoking, such as heart problems and an increased risk of lung cancer.\n\nIn addition to its help in quitting smoking, cytosine is much cheaper than other forms of NRT, costing only $20 to $35 for a 25-day treatment. NRT, on the other hand, costs between $100 to $700 for two months of treatment. \u201cSmokers and governments in most low and middle-income countries can\u2019t afford NRT, so cytisine will definitely have a major appeal to them,\u201d Walker told New Scientist.\n\nIf cytisine is so great, then why haven\u2019t we used it sooner? The fact is, not much research has been conducted on the alkaloid, and its use hasn't really expanded out of Eastern Europe. While it\u2019s been used to treat tobacco dependence in Eastern European countries for 50 years, and has been marketed as \u201cTabex\u201d by a Bulgarian company, research conducted in Bulgaria, Germany, Poland, and Russia in the 1960s and 70s did not comply with current standards for clinical trials. As a result, cytisine\u2019s benefits weren't completely explored in Western European countries or North America.\n\nThe current study, however, changes that, and a new form of treatment may soon be available for people who cannot afford NRT. \u201cI think this is the biggest news in smoking cessation treatment ever,\u201d Robert West, a researcher at University College London who led a previous study on the benefits of cytisine, told New Scientist. \u201cHere is a pill that can be produced for next to nothing, that can be bought by even the poorest smoker in India, and that can save literally millions of lives.\u201d\n\nSource: Walker N, Howe C, Glover M, McRobbie H, Barnes J, Nosa V.
