The text of the ad read as follows:\n\n\u201cThere are 20 million Americans who can\u2019t find a full-time job. But Eric Cantor wants to give corporations another 20 million foreign workers to hire instead.\u201d\n\nThe purpose of the ad was to link Cantor to immigration reform, a cause that Zuckerberg (and much of Silicon Valley) considers a No. 1 political priority. And while we can\u2019t say for sure whether the issue of immigration reform was the knife in Cantor\u2019s back, the subtext of the ad is intriguing: The Tea Party sees Silicon Valley as toxic. Mark Zuckerberg is an enemy of the people!\n\nLast November, the Hill reported that Zuckerberg had named immigration reform \u201cone of the biggest civil rights issues of our time.\u201d One has only to look at the comments appended to that article when it was copy-and-pasted to www.teaparty.org to see why Brat\u2019s campaign team figured associating Zuckerberg with Cantor was a knockout punch.\n\nThe comments are a typical putrid brew of racism, xenophobia, illiteracy and anti-Semitism \u2014 but there\u2019s also a strain of good old American populism, a strong sense of anger at the fact that America\u2019s corporate executives care more about the bottom line than they do the welfare of the American people.\n\nZuckerberg is a phony sell out who only wants cheap labor. The kind of money these people have can negate millions of your votes and buy Washington. This is no longer a democracy-its a money game, and these people know it. Zuckerberg is an idiot and a betrayer to all us LEGAL BORN AND LEGAL IMMIGRANTS!", "article_metadata": {"description": "The new anti-tech populism.
