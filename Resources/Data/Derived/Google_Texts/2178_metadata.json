The structure of their critique suggests not that they think cutting a deal with Iran, in which everyone makes concessions, is per se unwise, but that the global powers screwed up the negotiations and gave away too much. They argue in essence that the diplomacy was conducted incompetently, and that they would\u2019ve done a better job.\n\nBut there is no reason to believe this, because so many of the deal's prominent critics have thin or failed diplomatic records of their own or have built their careers around the notion that negotiating with enemies is a sign of inherent weakness.\n\nNetanyahu epitomizes the disconnect better than anyone else. Why should anybody in America or anywhere lend a favorable view to to Netanyahu\u2019s pronouncements about diplomatic tradecraft? He doesn\u2019t boast a record of cutting \"better deals\" or even really of cutting deals at all. To the contrary, the political balance he\u2019s struck in Israel, quite transparently, is to promise a \u201cbetter deal\u201d with Palestinians at some point in the future, while governing without any intention of reaching it. As his most recent election approached, he briefly campaigned on the promise not to cut one, then sheepishly and unconvincingly backtracked after his premiership was secured. He\u2019s brokered no major deals elsewhere in the region, either, or really treated diplomacy as a useful problem-solving tool in general. Viewed as a diplomatic effort, his campaign of sabotage against the global powers agreement is a reckless disaster, which risks causing irreparable damage to the relationship between his country and its one true, powerful ally.\n\nTo underscore that point, there is a pronounced strain of thought within Israel among skeptics of the agreement that Netanyahu is making a profound error by waging a scorched-earth campaign against it\u2014that the only thing worse than the deal itself is interfering to sabotage it. As the Wall Street Journal reported this weekend:\n\nIn unusually direct terms, Israeli President Reuven Rivlin this week warned Mr. Netanyahu that his aggressive campaign to defeat the deal risked harming a relationship central to Israel\u2019s security. \"The prime minister has waged a campaign against the United States as if the two sides were equal, and this is liable to hurt Israel,\" Mr. Rivlin, a member of the premier\u2019s Likud party, said in an interview published Friday in the daily Maariv. Yedioth Ahronoth and Haaretz carried similar interviews with the president. \"I have told him, and I\u2019m telling him again, that struggles, even those that are just, can ultimately come at Israel\u2019s expense,\" said the president, adding: \"We are largely isolated in the world.\"\n\nThis isn\u2019t a quirk unique to Netanyahu either. Most Republican presidential candidates have adopted the same approach to global affairs. They support a comically ineffective embargo over normalization with Cuba. They debate each other, as Scott Walker and Jeb Bush just did, over whether it might be necessary to bomb Iran on the first day of a Republican presidency, or only after waiting to get a cabinet in place. President Barack Obama\u2019s foreign policy record isn\u2019t unblemished, but he can boast of real diplomatic successes\u2014reaching climate change agreements with China, Brazil, and Mexico, re-establishing relations with Cuba, to say nothing of the global powers agreement itself. Republicans, by contrast, say things like, \u201cWhat we object to is the President's lack of realism\u2014his ideological belief that diplomacy is good and force is bad.\"\n\nYet at the same time, they stipulate that critics should take their promise that a \u201cbetter deal\u201d is possible at face value. In this way they are like, well, themselves, in the domestic realm\u2014forever promising to repeal Obamacare and replace it with \u201csomething that doesn't suppress wages and kill jobs,\u201d or \u201csomething terrific,\" without elaboration. Another \u201cbetter deal\u201d that for some reason can\u2019t be put to paper in a way that convinces anyone of its seriousness. But at least in the similarly farcical debate over Obamacare, much of the public has learned not to place stock in promises like this. The same can\u2019t be said of the Iran deal opponent\u2019s false promises, and against that backdrop the Republican position is beginning to seep into the mainstream.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "description": "They say Obama could get a \"better deal,\" but what do they know about diplomacy?", "og": {"site_name": "New Republic", "description": "They say Obama could get a \"better deal,\" but what do they know about diplomacy?\u00a0Next to nothing.", "title": "Republicans Who Oppose the Iran Deal Are Making Promises They Can\u2019t Keep", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/e6ab0e0c7710e9ba5a781725056c788661f76ad5.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "url": "https://newrepublic.com/article/122522/republicans-who-oppose-iran-deal-making-promises-they-cant-keep", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "They say Obama could get a \"better deal,\" but what do they know about diplomacy?\u00a0Next to nothing.", "creator": "@brianbeutler", "image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/e6ab0e0c7710e9ba5a781725056c788661f76ad5.jpeg?w=1024&h=512&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "title": "Republicans Who Oppose the Iran Deal Are Making Promises They Can\u2019t Keep", "site": "@newrepublic", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "parsely-metadata": "{\"thumb_image\":\"http://images.newrepublic.com/e6ab0e0c7710e9ba5a781725056c788661f76ad5.jpeg\"}", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Republicans Who Oppose the Iran Deal Are Making Promises They Can\u2019t Keep\",\"link\":\"https://newrepublic.com/article/122522/republicans-who-oppose-iran-deal-making-promises-they-cant-keep\",\"section\":\"Barack Obama\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-08-11T16:53:00.000Z\",\"post_id\":122522,\"author\":\"Brian Beutler\",\"type\":\"post\",\"tags\":[\"Barack Obama\",\"Politics\",\"Iran\",\"Jeb Bush\",\"Scott Walker\",\"Iran Nuclear Deal\",\"Israel\",\"Benjamin Netanyahu\",\"-type_article\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 4404589, "pages": 161419311535, "app_id": 1675346479369918}, "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thenewrepublic", "tag": "Barack Obama", "published_time": "2015-08-11"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Another \u201cbetter deal\u201d that for some reason can\u2019t be put to paper in a way that convinces anyone of its seriousness.\nHe doesn\u2019t boast a record of cutting \"better deals\" or even really of cutting deals at all.\nYet at the same time, they stipulate that critics should take their promise that a \u201cbetter deal\u201d is possible at face value.\nThe same can\u2019t be said of the Iran deal opponent\u2019s false promises, and against that backdrop the Republican position is beginning to seep into the mainstream.\nTo the contrary, the political balance he\u2019s struck in Israel, quite transparently, is to promise a \u201cbetter deal\u201d with Palestinians at some point in the future, while governing without any intention of reaching it."}
