In early trading in New York, Cellcom's shares were down 1.4 percent at $7.23. Consumers give Golan much credit for offering packages that include unlimited international and local calling, text messages and 6 GB of Internet surfing starting at $8 a month. Such prices have dented the profitability of Cellcom and its rivals. As part of its license, Golan is required to enter into a network-sharing agreement with Cellcom or build its own. Earlier this year, Niel said Golan had no choice but to merge with another player since a plan to share Cellcom's network was not approved by regulators while municipalities in Israel refused to approve the installation of more antennas.
