Another Republican poll from California shows Trump with an 18 point lead. Nearly half of those polled, 47 percent, said they believe Trump will be the nominee regardless of their preferred candidate. The same group said that if Trump wins the most delegates before the Republican National Convention, but not a majority, another candidate should be allowed to take the nomination. Forty-eight percent of people said Trump should be the nominee if he leads the delegate count.
