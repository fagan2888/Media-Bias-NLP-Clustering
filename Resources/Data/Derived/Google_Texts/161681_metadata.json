Between the presidential race and Pope Francis heading to Capitol Hill, there\u2019s never a dull moment.\n\nBut let\u2019s not forget that a week from tomorrow, congressional Republicans are quite likely to shut down the government \u2013 again.\n\nLate last week, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), who\u2019s championed similar showdowns over government funding and the debt ceiling as part of his far-right agenda, told Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity that it\u2019s Democrats \u201cwho are threatening a shutdown.\u201d Rubio\u2019s heard the rhetoric that it\u2019s Republicans who are engaged in brinkmanship.\n\n\u201cNo we\u2019re not,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cWe are in support of funding the government fully \u2014 just not giving any more money to this one organization that was just caught on video dismembering unborn children! Or, in one case, a child that had already been born alive, as Carly did very well last night, outlining and describing the video.\u201d\n\nPutting aside the fact that Fiorina appears to have been lying \u2013 a detail Rubio really ought to know \u2013 the far-right senator\u2019s broader refrain is a familiar one: in every Republican hostage standoff, GOP lawmakers make roughly the same argument. \u201cMeet our demands or we shoot the hostage,\u201d the pitch goes. \u201cAnd if you don\u2019t meet our demands, it\u2019s your fault if the hostage gets shot.\u201d\n\nBloomberg Politics had a good piece this morning on the familiarity of the rhetoric, noting that we heard the same people saying the same thing in 2013.\n\nAnd by \u201csame people,\u201d I\u2019m being quite literal. Noting Rubio\u2019s 2013 rhetoric, Bloomberg Politics noted, \u201c[T]he very same senator made the very same argument to the very same host two years ago, before Republicans tested the theory by shutting down the government for 16 days in an effort to defund another bete noire.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, the one who\u2019s threatening to shut down the government is the president and his Democratic allies,\u201d Rubio told Hannity in August 2013, shortly before he helped shut down the government over health care funding. \u201cWhat they\u2019re basically saying is unless the budget funds Obamacare, they won\u2019t support it. They\u2019re basically saying that unless we fund Obamacare they are willing to shut down the government.\u201d\n\nThis is almost word for word what Rubio told Hannity late last week. All one must do is replace \u201cObamacare\u201d with \u201cPlanned Parenthood.\u201d\n\nThe difference is, Planned Parenthood is more popular than the Affordable Care Act \u2013 making the gambit that much more politically foolish.\n\nIn fairness, it\u2019s not just Rubio \u2013 all kinds of other far-right politicians on Capitol Hill are pushing the same line. Each of them seem to believe that if they shut down the government, they can avoid blame, just like they said in 2013.\n\nThe GOP leadership in both chambers, to their credit, keep trying to tell rank-and-file members that they\u2019ll lose this fight. Rubio, Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, and dozens of House Republicans are choosing not to listen.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Two years ago, Republicans thought they could pin their shutdown on Democrats.
