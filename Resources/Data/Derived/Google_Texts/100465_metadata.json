Cantor\u2019s ouster could foretell strife at Saturday\u2019s meeting of the state Republican Party. (P. Kevin Morley/AP)\n\nVirginia Republicans watched and waited to see if the state party\u2019s treasurer would resign after he publicly questioned Muslims\u2019 contributions to society.\n\nSome urged his ouster; others kept quiet. Finally, he agreed to step down.\n\nThe episode added to the turmoil within the state party that is making a growing number of Republicans uneasy about the GOP\u2019s ability to elect statewide candidates or deliver Virginia for a Republican presidential candidate in 2016.\n\nIn June, a group of tea party activists, Ron Paul enthusiasts and staunch conservatives calling themselves the \u201cconservative coalition\u201d shocked the nation when they helped a little-known economics professor defeat former House majority leader Eric Cantor.\n\nThey also have skillfully worked behind the scenes to win control of the powerful internal party structure from so-called establishment Republicans \u2014 a crucial victory with deep consequences for party nominations and how the GOP spends its money.\n\nThe fighting could come to a head Saturday when Republicans from both camps \u2014 insurgents and establishment \u2014 gather in Richmond for a meeting of the party\u2019s governing body, the State Central Committee. The meeting comes as Democrats hold all five statewide offices and the GOP is struggling to define itself.\n\nOfficially, the committee will decide some internal issues. But unofficially, some are predicting a day-long slugfest between warring factions that haven\u2019t faced each other since Cantor\u2019s loss.\n\nWhile a meeting full of arcane parliamentary rules might seem irrelevant to the long-term success of the party, many Republicans say the decisions of a few dozen powerful insiders will have a direct impact on the GOP\u2019s likelihood of nominating candidates with enough mainstream appeal to win statewide elections in a changing Virginia.\n\nRon Butler, president of a \u00addirect-mail firm with ties to Cantor, was pessimistic that momentum would swing back to the establishment.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re acting more like the Muslim Brotherhood than the Republican Party in this country,\u201d he said of the conservative wing of the GOP. \u201cThey scream about Eric Holder and President Obama upholding the Constitution. They\u2019re attempting to throw their own constitution out.\u201d\n\nThe conservative wing tried to blacklist Butler\u2019s firm, an unprecedented move in Virginia politics that some say runs counter to the party\u2019s free-market ideals.\n\nBut Chris Stearns, a Republican activist and chairman of the party\u2019s 3rd Congressional District, applauded the fact that establishment stalwarts, whom he called the \u201cconsulting class,\u201d have lost influence to a wave of activism in Virginia.\n\n\u201cThis is the first time in modern political history in Virginia that grass-roots activists have had working majorities in the state party,\u201d said Stearns, who was Virginia state director for Paul\u2019s 2012 campaign for president. \u201cFinally, these guys are becoming irrelevant.\u201d\n\nWith big policy issues facing the state, including Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe\u2019s effort to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act and a worsening state budget shortfall, some Republicans see their internal troubles as an unhelpful distraction.\n\nThe flap about the former party treasurer began July 29, when Bob FitzSimmonds posted an inflammatory comment about Muslims on Facebook. It wasn\u2019t FitzSimmonds\u2019s first brush with controversy; the Nokesville resident, who works for the Prince William County Circuit Court clerk, had previously used an offensive word to describe state Del. Barbara J. Comstock (R-Fairfax), who is now a congressional candidate. FitzSimmonds also wrote, in a 2012 Facebook post, that President Obama would blame his predecessor, George W. Bush, when he \u201cdies and goes to Hell.\u201d\n\nThis time, FitzSimmonds was reacting to Obama\u2019s praise of Muslims for helping to build \u201cthe very fabric of our nation and strengthening the core of our democracy.\u201d\n\n\u201cExactly what part of our nation\u2019s fabric was woven by Muslims?\u201d FitzSimmonds wrote. \u201cWhat about Sikhs, Animists, and Jainists? Should we be thanking them too?\u201d\n\nHouse Speaker William J. Howell (R-Stafford) quickly called for FitzSimmonds\u2019s resignation from his party post; Howell was followed a few days later by state GOP Chairman Pat Mullins and Vice Chairman Michael E. Thomas.\n\nBut others kept quiet while FitzSimmonds\u2019s online comment created a PR nightmare for the party\u2019s brand. It wasn\u2019t until several days later that he finally resigned in an unapologetic letter to members of the State Central Committee. And it included a catch: He asked to stay on until a replacement is found, a process that could take months and might come up Saturday.\n\nDemocrats seized on the FitzSimmonds controversy to cast \u00adRepublicans as incendiary and noninclusive. The state party specifically called on Republican U.S. Senate candidate Ed Gillespie to denounce the comments, which the Democrats called \u201cbigoted.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis hateful language has no place in any organization and is extremely offensive to Virginians practicing the religions Fitz\u00adSimmonds discredited in his post,\u201d Executive Director Robert Dempsey said at the time.\n\nMany Republicans cringed \u2014 particularly because some in the party, including Gillespie, have been fighting against that very perception. Another concern is the possibility that the split in the party will hurt fundraising, even as outside groups increase their influence over elections.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t keep poking your finger in Main Street\u2019s eye and expect Main Street to keep raising your money,\u201d said Rob Catron, a Republican lobbyist in Richmond who was chief of staff to Ed Schrock, a Republican who represented Virginia\u2019s 2nd Congressional District for two terms. \u201cWe\u2019ve worked really hard to open the tent and expand the party, and some tea party activists are doing the opposite.\u201d\n\nOn the flip side, the party\u2019s newly empowered conservative coalition, which has effectively tapped into voter dissatisfaction with incumbents such as Cantor, has given a place in the party to some activists who previously felt unwelcome.\n\nAt the center of the feud is Mullins, the state GOP\u2019s septuagenarian chairman, who sometimes looks like the ultimate peacemaker and at other times has helped cement the conservative coalition\u2019s takeover. At the height of battles over internal elections in the spring, Mullins chose Patrick M. McSweeney, a firebrand conservative, onetime state GOP head and longtime thorn in the establishment\u2019s side, to replace the party\u2019s attorney.\n\nMullins also declined to endorse Cantor\u2019s right-hand man, Linwood Cobb, for a district chairmanship, and Cobb lost in a spectacular precursor to the congressman\u2019s own defeat a few weeks later. In another district fight, Mullins endorsed a conservative coalition ally and party donor over state Sen. Frank W. Wagner (R-Virginia Beach.)\n\nMullins declined requests for comment for this article.\n\nAt the core of the rift is a ideological clash about how candidates are nominated for elected office. The conservative coalition prefers party-run conventions that attract the most committed, conservative activists to day-long gatherings. Moderate Republicans prefer primaries, which are open to all voters in Virginia.\n\nLast year, conservatives in crucial party leadership positions successfully pushed for a convention \u2014 and went on to nominate candidates for governor, lieutenant governor and attorney general whom Democrats, on their way to a historic sweep of all three offices, painted as too conservative.\n\nStearns said conventions put candidates on the hot seat before educated voters.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re forced to answer difficult questions and actually earn the votes of these people, and that scares the living daylights out of them,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Del. Scott W. Taylor (R-Virginia Beach), an Iraq war veteran, has introduced legislation to do away with conventions because members of the military cannot participate. He\u2019s frustrated by efforts to perpetuate the exclusive events.\n\n\u201cI think some people are really overstepping their boundaries,\u201d he said, \u201cand it\u2019s really undermining our party.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "vapolitics, Ed Gillespie, Barbara Comstock, tea party, Ron Paul, VAGOP, Eric Cantor", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Decisions of Central Committee may shape electoral prospects of the squabbling party.", "title": "Divisions may flare at Va.
