USA Basketball says Oklahoma City guard Russell Westbrook will not participate this summer so he can rest some previous knee injuries.

Chairman Jerry Colangelo says Tuesday that USA Basketball had been communicating with Westbrook since the end of the season and knew his withdrawal was a possibility.

Westbrook was a member of the Americans’ gold medal-winning teams at the 2010 World Championship and 2012 Olympics. He has had multiple knee operations since, though was able to help the Thunder reach the Western Conference finals.

Colangelo says in a statement that the U.S. would love to have Westbrook but that “this is the right decision.”

The Americans will begin training camp on July 28 in Las Vegas, a month before the World Cup of Basketball opens in Spain.
