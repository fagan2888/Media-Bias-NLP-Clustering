In 2000, he purchased a majority stake in the Dallas Mavericks, where he has been known to watch games from the stands and yell at referees when he disagrees with their calls.\n\nCuban also appears as \u201cshark investor\u201d on the ABC reality series \"Shark Tank.\"\n\n\n\nIn the interview Sunday, Cuban suggested that Trump\u2019s whirlwind presidential run has opened the door to nontraditional candidates like himself.\n\n\u201cWell, it's certainly more of a consideration than it was, for the reasons we've mentioned before, that you don't have to be the perfect Stepford candidate like you would've been in the past,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump has a \u201creal chance to win,\u201d Cuban said, but criticized the New York real estate mogul for appearing to push seat-of-his-pants proposals.\n\nIf Trump approached him about running for vice president? \u201cI'd be, like, \u2018Okay, Donald. That's great. Let's talk about it,\u201d Cuban said. \u201cBut we're both going to have to dig in and really look and understand the issues so we can come up with solutions.\u2019\u201d\n\nHe added that it was too early to say whether he would run for president in 2020 or 2024.\n\nAsked to assess the Obama presidency, Cuban said the Democrat has \u201cdone a lot of good things,\u201d such as expanding access to health care, but has also made foreign policy mistakes.\n\n\u201cFrom an entrepreneur's perspective, it's given entrepreneurs the chance to leave jobs they were stuck in and get insurance where they otherwise might not have had it,\u201d Cuban said of the Affordable Care Act, Obama\u2019s signature health care law.\n\nHe offered few specifics on his foreign policy critiques of Obama.\n\nBut he didn't avoid a question about who he thought would win this year's NBA title \u2014 The Oklahoma City Thunder.\n\nClick here to see this story as it appeared on the Texas Tribune.", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "DALLAS ( TEXAS TRIBUNE ) -- Mark Cuban says he would \"absolutely\" consider becoming Hillary Clinton's running mate this presidential election cycle, \"if she's willing to listen.\" &nbsp; \"The key would be that she'd have to go more to center,\" the outspoken billionaire entrepreneur, reality TV star and owner of the Dallas Mavericks told NBC's \"Meet the Press\" in a segment that aired Sunday morning.", "author": "TEGNA", "og": {"site_name": "KHOU", "description": "DALLAS ( TEXAS TRIBUNE ) -- Mark Cuban says he would", "title": "Mark Cuban would consider VP pitches from Trump, Clinton", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://content.wfaa.com/photo/2016/05/22/USATSI_9138124_1463949383046_2431840_ver1.0_640_360.jpg", "height": 360}, "url": "http://www.khou.com/news/local/texas/mark-cuban-would-conisder-vp-pitches-from-trump-clinton/211452561", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "http://www.khou.com", "description": "DALLAS ( TEXAS TRIBUNE ) -- Mark Cuban says he would", "title": "Mark Cuban would consider VP pitches from Trump, Clinton", "image": {"src": "http://content.wfaa.com/photo/2016/05/22/USATSI_9138124_1463949383046_2431840_ver1.0_640_360.jpg"}, "site": "@KHOU", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"app_id": 245371802196100}, "keywords": "mark cuban,vice president,meet the press,News,Politics,Local,Mavericks,Facebook-Instant", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1280"}, "article_summary": "Trump has a \u201creal chance to win,\u201d Cuban said, but criticized the New York real estate mogul for appearing to push seat-of-his-pants proposals.\nFeb 24, 2016; Dallas, TX, USA; Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban during the game against the Oklahoma City Thunder at American Airlines Center.\nCuban also said he would consider joining Donald Trump\u2019s ticket, and he gave a mixed review to President Obama\u2019s two terms in office.\nIn the interview Sunday, Cuban suggested that Trump\u2019s whirlwind presidential run has opened the door to nontraditional candidates like himself.\nBorn in Pittsburgh, but transplanted to Dallas in 1982, Cuban has dabbled with a host of startups and other businesses."}
