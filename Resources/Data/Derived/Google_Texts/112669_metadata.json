The bread is different. The milk has less fat than some kids are used to at home.\n\nOn the plus side, students can eat as many fruits and vegetables as they want.\n\nSchools don\u2019t have to participate in Michelle Obama\u2019s signature 2010 child nutrition legislation, but they get federal subsidies if they do.\n\nAn eruption of aggravation about the state of school lunches in the Obama era is never far away.
