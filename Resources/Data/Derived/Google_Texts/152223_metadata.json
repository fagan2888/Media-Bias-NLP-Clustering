This aspect was essential to Adam Smith\u2019s original concept of capitalism, which must be tempered with rules for fair play and benevolence for others.\n\nThe Citizens Council for Health Freedom has just published a paper I wrote about the history and potential future of mutual aid associations, often called \u201cfriendly societies\u201d in Great Britain or \u201cfraternal associations\u201d in the United States.\n\nThe Founders were also very aware of this third sector, arguing that self-government was appropriate only for a virtuous people. This is underscored by a host of quotes compiled by the Washington, Jefferson, and Madison Institute, including these:\n\nGeorge Washington: \u2018Virtue or morality is a necessary spring of popular government, and \u2018Human rights can only be assured among a virtuous people.\u2019\n\n\n\nBenjamin Franklin: \u2018Only a virtuous people are capable of freedom.\u2019\n\nWhat are these virtues? David Green sums them up:\n\nWe only have to look at our own language to discover the rich variety of virtues that make a free society work and which describe the obligations we all owe to one another. Good character, honesty, duty, self-sacrifice, honour, service, self-discipline, toleration, respect, justice, self-improvement, trust, civility, fortitude, courage, integrity, diligence, patriotism, consideration for others, thrift and reverence are just a few.\n\nThe emphasis on these virtues allowed Anglo-Saxon cultures to move away from humanity\u2019s default systems of governance\u2014political and economic dictatorship by war lords, kings, or church. The Anglo-Saxon approach to liberty tempered with virtue is a counter-intuitive way to order human affairs. It has existed for only a few centuries of human history, and there is constant pressure to lay it aside and return to the default system. It takes constant nurturing, and especially education in what is virtuous behavior. We cannot assume that such skills are instinctual or inherited.\n\nThe Eighteenth Century\u2019s Astonishing Societal Strength Politics and economics alone cannot fill all of society\u2019s needs. There are spiritual and moral requirements, of course, but there are also more practical issues that may fall between the cracks. The political system may be in gridlock and the economic system may be dysfunctional. During such times families and communities may band together to mutually solve problems.\n\nPolitics and economics alone cannot fill all of society\u2019s needs. This happened in Great Britain and the British colonies in America beginning in the eighteenth century in the form of \u201cfriendly societies\u201d or \u201cfraternal organizations.\u201d The paper looks at these movements in depth, drawing largely on Green\u2019s \u201cReinventing Civil Society: The Rediscovery of Welfare Without Politics\u201d and David Beito\u2019s \u201cFrom Mutual Aid to the Welfare State.\u201dIt is extraordinary how successful these organizations were and how much good they did. They started by offering burial benefits and sickness funds so common workers could avoid a pauper\u2019s funeral and have some income when they were too sick to work. These evolved into life insurance and medical benefits, which covered one-third of all American men (and their families) by 1910. Many of the groups also opened orphanages and schools for the children of deceased members, credit unions, newspapers, and many other forms of commercial activity.\n\nLots More Than Funny Hats Importantly, they did not only provide material benefits, but also the kind of moral support currently offered by groups like Alcoholics Anonymous. For example, the Grand United Order of Oddfellows told its new members:\n\nIt is desired that you should make the event of your Initiation a time for strict self-examination; and if you should find anything in your past life to amend, I solemnly charge you to set about that duty without delay, \u2014 let no immoral practice, idle action, or low and vulgar pursuit, be retained by you.\n\nLodge members helped each other relocate when they couldn\u2019t find work, disciplined brothers who were neglectful of their families, and visited sick members at home or in the hospital.\n\nThese lodges were elaborate, sometimes very large, self-governing organizations. They taught their often poorly educated manual laborer members how to chair meetings, write minutes, conduct fair discussions, balance books, make presentations, and perform all the other tasks required by a parliament or a large organization. These were men who had little power or respect on their jobs, but as lodge members they had the opportunity to be leaders and take responsibility for the welfare of others.\n\nThe movement was not confined to working men of English descent. In the United States, women and African-Americans had their own lodges, as did succeeding waves of immigrants: the Irish, Poles, Germans, Italians, Jews, and Latin Americans all had mutual aid societies of their own.\n\nHow Elites Eroded Working People\u2019s Control Over Their Lives With the dawn of the twentieth century, fraternal organizations met with intense push-back from organized medicine, which resented the idea that common working men should be the bosses of \u201cmedical gentlemen,\u201d and from the commercial insurance industry that began to see the market possibilities of life insurance.\n\nBut the most important opponent of these self-help organizations came from the Progressive movement, which was committed to a society in which a well-educated elite was entrusted to manage the affairs of the populace. Beito writes: \u201cThe traditional fraternal worldview was under attack. Age-old virtues such as mutual aid, character building, self-restraint, thrift, and self-help, once taken for granted, came under fire either as outmoded or as drastically in need of modification.\u201d\n\nThe most important opponent of these self-help organizations came from the Progressive movement, which was committed to a society in which a well-educated elite was entrusted to manage everyone\u2019s affairs. It wasn\u2019t just that such values were boring and old-fashioned, but that their existence undermined the necessity of the State as the center of gravity in a modern society. Ideas such as thrift were pernicious to an economy that relied on consumer spending for growth. The more one saved, the less one spent. Similarly with loyalty: loyalty to one\u2019s neighbors and coworkers interfered with loyalty to the State.\n\nWith the growth of workers compensation laws, employer-sponsored health benefits, commercially available life insurance, more generous welfare programs, and the move away from orphanages towards foster care throughout the twentieth century, the core activities of fraternal societies became less essential.\n\nThey devolved either into social clubs like the Moose, Eagles, and Elks clubs of today, or charitable organizations like the Knights of Columbus and Thrivent Financial for Lutherans, although the former still has $86 billion of life insurance in force, and the latter still has 2.6 million members and was listed as number 284 on Fortune Magazine\u2019s list of the Fortune 500 in 2004.\n\nSome Remnants Left Today In recent years a new wave has started to emerge, especially in the form of the Christian health care sharing ministries, which are exempt from the requirements of the Affordable Care Act. These are still pretty rudimentary, although Kevin Williamson argues in \u201cThe End is Near: And It\u2019s Going to be Awesome,\u201d that when combined with social media they could be a model for a new form of self-help that will become ever more essential as governments around the world come face-to-face with the inability to keep their social welfare promises.", "article_metadata": {"item-publish-date": "Wed, 27 Aug 2014 07:10:15 EDT", "og": {"site_name": "The Federalist", "description": "History shows how local, mutual aid fed hungry children, covered medical emergencies, and empowered working-class men\u2014no formal government necessary.", "title": "Mutual Aid Societies: It\u2019s Amazing What People Can Do Together", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/4719865330_50f389f900_b.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-08-29T07:32:25+00:00", "url": "http://thefederalist.com/2014/08/27/mutual-aid-societies-its-amazing-what-people-can-do-together/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Federalist", "description": "History shows how local, mutual aid fed hungry children, covered medical emergencies, and empowered working-class men\u2014no formal government necessary.", "creator": "@FDRLST", "image": {"src": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/4719865330_50f389f900_b.jpg"}, "title": "Mutual Aid Societies: It\u2019s Amazing What People Can Do Together", "site": "@FDRLST", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article": {"section": "Infrastructure", "tag": "Adam Smith,Alcoholics Anonymous,Anglo-Saxon,benevolent societies,Benjamin Franklin,Citizens Council for Health Freedom,David Beito,David Green,From Mutual Aid to the Welfare State,George Washington,Grand United Order of Oddfellows,Kevin Williamson,Knights of Columbus,Michael Novak,mutual aid,Thrivent Financial for Lutherans", "published_time": "2014-08-27T07:10:15+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-29T07:32:25+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "History shows how local, mutual aid fed hungry children, covered medical emergencies, and empowered working-class men\u2014no formal government necessary."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd6fc8\"", "article_summary": "The Founders were also very aware of this third sector, arguing that self-government was appropriate only for a virtuous people.\nThese evolved into life insurance and medical benefits, which covered one-third of all American men (and their families) by 1910.\nThere are spiritual and moral requirements, of course, but there are also more practical issues that may fall between the cracks.\nThis aspect was essential to Adam Smith\u2019s original concept of capitalism, which must be tempered with rules for fair play and benevolence for others.\nThe emphasis on these virtues allowed Anglo-Saxon cultures to move away from humanity\u2019s default systems of governance\u2014political and economic dictatorship by war lords, kings, or church."}
