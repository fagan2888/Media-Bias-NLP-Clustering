Marco Rubio fights to keep his presidential bid alive by winning the Republican primary in his home state on March 15, he needs to perform strongly with one group in particular: Hispanics in southern and central Florida. Read Arian Campo-Flores\u2019s full post in Washington Wire.\n\nPAUL SANCYA/ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nDECISION TO PURSUE A NATIONAL STRATEGY HOBBLES RUBIO CAMPAIGN: At the start of his presidential bid, Marco Rubio made a fateful, strategic decision to run a national campaign rather than build momentum by targeting specific states and regions. Now, a humiliating and campaign-ending defeat Tuesday on his home turf looms for the once-rising Florida senator. Several polls on Wednesday showed front-runner Donald Trump trouncing him in Florida by double-digit margins. Thursday\u2019s Republican debate in Miami offers one more chance to try to shake up the race, and Mr. Rubio has no plans to leave the state before Tuesday\u2019s primary. Beth Reinhard reports. [Plus: Mr. Rubio said his children were \u201cembarrassed\u201d by the tone of his attacks on Mr. Trump, expressing regret and a desire to set a good example.]\n\nWSJ STORIES YOU SHOULDN\u2019T MISS\n\nNGUYEN HUY KHAM/REUTERS\n\nFREE TRADE LOSES POLITICAL FAVOR: After decades in which successive Republican and Democratic presidents have pushed to open U.S. and global markets, resentment toward free trade now appears to have the upper hand in both parties, making passage this year of a sweeping Pacific trade deal far less likely and clouding the longer-term outlook for international economic exchange. Many Democrats have long blamed free-trade deals for big job losses and depressed wages, especially in the industrialized Midwest, which has been battered over the years by competition from lower-cost manufacturing centers in countries like Japan, Mexico and China. But one big surprise Tuesday was how loudly trade fears reverberated among Republican voters in the primary contests in Michigan and Mississippi\u2014evidence, many observers say, of a widening undercurrent of skepticism on the right about who reaps the benefits from loosened trade restrictions. Bob Davis reports.\n\nCHARLES REX ARBOGAST/ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nFOR KASICH, FISCAL SUCCESS COMES AT SOME COST: John Kasich says he fixed Ohio\u2019s ailing economy and he can fix the nation\u2019s. But his statehouse success came at the expense of many of Ohio\u2019s cities and towns, which had to raise taxes or cut services, his critics charge. The Ohio governor\u2019s central argument in his bid for the Republican nomination is that he is the only candidate left who has the experience and wiles to run the federal government properly. It is a pitch he has made at every GOP debate and likely will repeat when the candidates take the stage in Miami on Thursday. Exhibit No. 1, he says, is that he turned an $8 billion budget shortfall into a $2 billion surplus. But Mr. Kasich\u2019s accomplishment\u2014and even his critics back home acknowledge he did turn a big looming deficit into a surplus\u2014involves a fair amount of luck, as well as some controversial decisions.
