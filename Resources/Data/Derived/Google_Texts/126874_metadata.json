JLL Partners and Trimaran Capital also will retain a stake.\n\nThe Franklin-based company has not determined how many shares will be offered or at what price. Proceeds from the initial public offering will be used to repay debt and for other general corporate purposes. According to the S-1, the company expects to have a stock split in its 2015 fiscal year.\n\nThe company is in a quiet period and cannot comment further on the IPO, according to a spokeswoman, noting that \u201cactivity with respect to any equity securities offering will be reflected in our filings with the SEC.\u201d\n\nJ.P. Morgan Securities, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Barclays Capital are the joint lead bookrunners. Evercore Group, Goldman Sachs & Co. and Citigroup Global Markets are managers while BMO Capital Markets Corp. and TPG Capital BD are co-managers.\n\nIASIS owns 15 acute care hospitals and one behavioral health hospital that have a total of 3,604 licensed beds, as well as several outpatient service facilities and 132 physician clinics. It operates in Salt Lake City; Phoenix; West Monroe, La.; and five cities in Texas.\n\nThe company has seen a drop in uninsured patients under the Affordable Care Act, including a Medicaid expansion in Arizona. In 2014, self-pay admissions dropped to 6.9 percent from 8 percent the year prior, according to the S-1. It also saw a nearly 2 percent decrease in uncompensated care as a percentage of acute care revenue in the same time periods.\n\nThe S-1 specifically mentions, in several places about risk factors that potential investors should consider, continued uncertainty about the future of the ACA as a result of the upcoming King v. Burwell case at the Supreme Court. That case, to be argued on March 4, questions whether tax subsidies for health insurance are valid on both exchanges at the federal and state level.\n\nIASIS will be the fourth publicly traded hospital operator in the Nashville area upon a successful IPO, joining Community Health Systems, HCA and LifePoint. IASIS pulled a proposed IPO in March 2001 over unfavorable market conditions.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://tnne.ws/1CSMG47", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "IASIS Healthcare Corp. filing kicks off proposed initial public offering.", "og": {"site_name": "The Tennessean", "description": "IASIS Healthcare Corp. filing kicks off proposed initial public offering.", "title": "IASIS sets sights on NYSE listing", "url": "http://www.tennessean.com/story/money/industries/health-care/2015/02/02/iasis-sets-sights-nyse-listing/22750029/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/tennessean.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "IASIS Healthcare Corp. filing kicks off proposed initial public offering.", "title": "IASIS sets sights on NYSE listing", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/40ca3afaf97e1558e165456b0f614b0ddc00672f/c=0-300-1500-1800&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Nashville/2015/02/02/B9316095075Z.1_20150202221453_000_GIN9RK5BP.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@tennessean", "site": "@tennessean", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600028886", "fb": {"app_id": 121487414583460}, "viewport": "width=1070", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/byhollyfletcher"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Companies/Goldman Sachs Group", "gci-asset-type": "data", "gci-categories": "Companies/Goldman Sachs Group", "title": "IASIS sets sights on NYSE listing", "author": "Holly Fletcher", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "money/industries/health-care", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e9c76406e2cc255455f8a784eb318461f02bba3b/c=0-50-1500-2050/local/-/media/Nashville/2015/02/02/B9316095075Z.1_20150202221453_000_GIN9RK5BP.1-0.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2caf8bbae9d6776f293c7e99fada12d4f6574b76/c=0-300-1500-1800/local/-/media/Nashville/2015/02/02/B9316095075Z.1_20150202221453_000_GIN9RK5BP.1-0.jpg", "contenttype": "data", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/998711010a1328f0a1e6b7393b48272d6608ca28/c=0-488-1500-1613/local/-/media/Nashville/2015/02/02/B9316095075Z.1_20150202221453_000_GIN9RK5BP.1-0.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e9b71dcf9629c82e51d42e06be23147550efcda2/c=0-628-1500-1472&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/Nashville/2015/02/02/B9316095075Z.1_20150202221453_000_GIN9RK5BP.1-0.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-02-02T21:15:18.830000-06:00", "shorthed": "IASIS sets sights on NYSE listing", "articleid": 22750029, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4b66f3ae7cf61a6e71f968274336d31a8d268a2f/c=0-628-1500-1472/local/-/media/Nashville/2015/02/02/B9316095075Z.1_20150202221453_000_GIN9RK5BP.1-0.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a92d3fe39ba3e08354111f84f0fbaeff11fa9ff1/c=160-0-1341-2100/local/-/media/Nashville/2015/02/02/B9316095075Z.1_20150202221453_000_GIN9RK5BP.1-0.jpg"}}}, "article_summary": "IASIS owns 15 acute care hospitals and one behavioral health hospital that have a total of 3,604 licensed beds, as well as several outpatient service facilities and 132 physician clinics.\nIASIS will be the fourth publicly traded hospital operator in the Nashville area upon a successful IPO, joining Community Health Systems, HCA and LifePoint.\nAccording to the S-1, the company expects to have a stock split in its 2015 fiscal year.\nThe company has seen a drop in uninsured patients under the Affordable Care Act, including a Medicaid expansion in Arizona.\nIn 2014, self-pay admissions dropped to 6.9 percent from 8 percent the year prior, according to the S-1."}
