I\u2019ve heard that Cedars-Sinai, for example, will not accept coverage from Covered California.\n\nA: You heard right, Lily.\n\nLet\u2019s say you currently buy health insurance on the open market. But you discover that you can get tax credits from the state\u2019s new health insurance exchange, called Covered California. (For people whose incomes qualify, tax credits will lower the cost of premiums. To find out if that includes you, use Covered California\u2019s rate calculator.)\n\nAnd wouldn\u2019t you know it, the same insurance company that covers you now also offers a plan on the exchange.\n\nThat means you\u2019ll get to keep your doctor if you buy that Covered California plan. Right? RIGHT???\n\nNot necessarily.\n\nMany insurers are limiting the networks of doctors and hospitals that participate in their Covered California plans, meaning your doctor may not be included.\n\n\u201cYou need to do your homework because the same doctor may or may not be there,\u201d says Nicole Kasabian Evans of the California Association of Health Plans. \u201cIt depends by plan.\u201d\n\nThe reason that your doctor may not participate in a plan offered by the same insurer is financial. Insurers limit networks to keep their costs \u2013 and premiums \u2013 down. Which is why Cedars-Sinai in Southern California, one of the most expensive hospitals in the nation, is not included as a provider in Covered California plans.\n\n(UPDATE: Cedars-Sinai later joined some Covered California networks. Visit its website at www.cedars-sinai.edu to learn more.)\n\nCovered California says you can find out if your doctor or hospital participates by calling 800-300-1506 or visiting its website: CoveredCA.com. But, sorry to say, as of my deadline on Oct. 2, the search tool still wasn\u2019t there.\n\nQ: Everything I have read refers to tax credits. Can you explain? Will we take tax credits on our end-of-year income tax forms or get credit at the time of enrollment?\n\nI\u2019ve written endlessly about Obamacare\u2019s complications. But it\u2019s not just the law\u2019s provisions I\u2019m referring to. As Jayne from Bakersfield notes, it\u2019s also the Byzantine language.\n\nThe Obamacare tax credits are sometimes called subsidies. The Internal Revenue Service uses the term \u201cpremium tax credits.\u201d I\u2019ve also heard them referred to as \u201cadvance premium assistance.\u201d Huh?\n\nWhatever you want to call them, these federally funded tax credits will be available to individuals and families who don\u2019t have access to \u201caffordable\u201d health insurance from their employer (as defined in the law) or coverage from a government program such as Medi-Cal.\n\nYou will qualify if your income falls between 138 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL). This year, 400 percent equals $45,960 for an individual or $94,200 for a family of four. (Click here for FPL guidelines.)\n\nBut you don\u2019t have to wait until tax time the following year to receive the credits. Tax credits can be applied in advance, immediately lowering your monthly premiums.\n\nBy the way, you can only receive tax credits by buying from Covered California. They won\u2019t be offered for employer-sponsored insurance or open-market plans.\n\nQ: Will my eligibility for tax credits in 2014 be based on my 2012 or 2013 income, or my estimated 2014 income? And when I do my 2014 taxes (in 2015), will there be an adjustment if my actual 2014 income is different than my estimated 2014 income?\n\nA: Let\u2019s start off with a straightforward answer and then ease into the pain: Your eligibility will depend on your 2014 income, says Anne Gonzales of Covered California, so make the best estimate you can.\n\nNow for the pain: Yes, Ray from Richmond, if your actual income varies from your estimate, either you\u2019ll owe, or be owed, money.\n\n\u201cIf your income goes down, you\u2019re entitled to more credit, so you\u2019ll be entitled to a refund on your 2014 tax return,\u201d says Garry Browning, a Certified Public Accountant in Modesto who trains other CPAs in Obamacare matters.\n\n\u201cBut if your advance payments were more than you\u2019re entitled to, you\u2019re going to have to pay back the difference.\u201d\n\nBrowning notes that there is a maximum you\u2019d have to pay back, which varies with your income.\n\nIf, for instance, annual family income is under 200 percent of FPL, repayment is capped at $600 ($300 for individuals). The cap is $2,500 ($1,250 for individuals) if annual income is between 300 percent and 400 percent of FPL.\n\nTo avoid sticker shock, Gonzales suggests you contact Covered California right away if your income changes during the year.\n\n\u201cOtherwise, the adjustment will be made at tax time,\u201d she says, \u201cand that could be a surprise.\u201d\n\nLearn more about Emily here.", "article_metadata": {"Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Q: Will doctors and hospitals who accept health insurance from companies like Blue Shield accept insurance sold by the health insurance exchange?\nWill we take tax credits on our end-of-year income tax forms or get credit at the time of enrollment?\nBut you discover that you can get tax credits from the state\u2019s new health insurance exchange, called Covered California.\nThe Internal Revenue Service uses the term \u201cpremium tax credits.\u201d I\u2019ve also heard them referred to as \u201cadvance premium assistance.\u201d Huh?\nThe Obamacare tax credits are sometimes called subsidies."}
