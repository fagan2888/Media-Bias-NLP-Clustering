Derrick White, a 6-foot-5, 180-pound guard out of Parker, has transferred from Division II University of Colorado-Colorado Springs and signed a financial aid agreement to play with the Buffaloes, CU announced Sunday.

White will have to sit out the 2015-16 season, per NCAA rules, and will have one year of eligibility remaining after playing three at UCCS.

White averaged 25.8 points, 7.4 rebounds and 5.2 assists per game for the Mountain Lions last season, his junior year, while helping UCCS to a 27-6 record, its first Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference Tournament Championship and to the second round of the NCAA Division II National Tournament. White, a three-time All-America, also became the first UCCS player named to the National Association of Basketball Coaches All-America team.

“Derrick’s a versatile Division II All-American,” CU coach Tad Boyle said in a release Sunday. “He was a kid overlooked by virtually everybody, obviously except the University of Colorado-Colorado Springs, coming out of high school. He’s got great size, great athleticism, and he has great skill. When you see a guy that’s an All-American, and has proven everything that he can prove at the Division II level, it’s exciting to bring a player like that who can score, rebound, and pass into your program.”

White, the seventh player to transfer to CU under Boyle, started every game (87) in his three years at UCCS and holds school records in career points (1,912 points) and assists (343). He also holds th single-game assist record (11) — a feat he achieved three times in 2014-15 — and has recorded 15 career double-doubles.

White leaves UCCS with career averages of 22.0 points on 48.8 percent shooting, 3.9 assists and 5.9 rebounds in 30.9 minutes per game.
