That\u2019s 24 games, 46 days and 1,152 minutes away.\n\nTax day, April 15, is getaway day: the last day of the Nuggets\u2019 season. Rest assured, there are players who are already counting.\n\nAnd if by now you\u2019ve already connected the dots to the similarity with Nick Van Exel\u2019s infamous \u201c1-2-3 \u2026 Cancun!\u201d in 1998, you win the Showcase Showdown.\n\nHey, no one said the Nuggets who uttered the new millennium version of that were original.\n\nVan Exel, who yelled his chant at the end of a practice during a Western Conference finals in which the Los Angeles Lakers were being swept by Utah, insisted it was a joke.\n\n\u201cEveryone who was in that locker room with me knows I\u2019d never give up on the team,\u201d Van Exel later told reporters. \u201cBut finger pointing happens. I never meant anything wrong.\u201d\n\nNuggets Mailbag: Pose a question for Christopher Dempsey\n\nThe Lakers found it so funny, one month after those words were uttered they shipped Van Exel to the Nuggets for Tyronn Lue and Tony Battie. So it was oddly fitting that at least a few of these Nuggets, in one very disrespectful moment, at the end of another blowout loss, against Utah, channeled their inner Van Exel.\n\nMake no mistake, the last few weeks of this season are going to be difficult.\n\nThe Nuggets are careening to their worst record since before the Carmelo Anthony era. The Nuggets went 17-65 in the 2002-03 season, and that enabled them to draft Anthony. While the hope among many fans is that all the pain being endured this season leads to a similar result, there are still a lot of games to be played.\n\nAnd for Nuggets coach Brian Shaw and his staff, that means there is a locker room to keep together and a team to cajole into putting more of an effort on the court. That is true even if there are players with one foot out the door and already in the sand of (insert any sunny beach here).\n\nShaw said watching lackluster performances game after game is frustrating, but he points the first finger of blame at himself.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m frustrated in myself because I feel that I need to figure out a way to do a better job at trying to get that out of us, get that hustle and those kinds of plays and to play with more of a sense of urgency, play with more tenacity,\u201d he said.\n\nBridging that seemingly Grand Canyon-sized communication gap has been arguably the biggest issue Shaw has faced and has yet to figure out in his two seasons as a head coach. A lot of NBA players aren\u2019t self-starters; he has had to try to get them motivated. And his old-school tactics haven\u2019t worked.\n\nAny success he eventually has in the NBA hinges on him getting that solved.\n\nShaw knows this about his Denver crew: \u201cOur guys are frustrated, too. And so the weight of this all starts to come down. Some guys in those situations fight harder. Some guys give in.\u201d\n\nAnd some just wish they were in Cancun.\n\nChristopher Dempsey: cdempsey@denverpost.com or twitter.com/dempseypost", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Dempsey: Nuggets counting down to end of season", "title": "Dempsey: Nuggets counting down to end of season", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/02/28/dempsey-nuggets-counting-down-to-end-of-season/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150131__nuggets-brian-shawp1-1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150131__nuggets-brian-shawp1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-02-28T20:08:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-24T23:05:46+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd984\"", "article_summary": "Tax day, April 15, is getaway day: the last day of the Nuggets\u2019 season.\n\u201cEveryone who was in that locker room with me knows I\u2019d never give up on the team,\u201d Van Exel later told reporters.\nA fourth-quarter huddle late in the Nuggets\u2019 104-82 loss to the Utah Jazz on Friday broke with this phrase: \u201c1-2-3 \u2026 six weeks!\u201dAs in six weeks to go until the end of the season.\nThe Nuggets went 17-65 in the 2002-03 season, and that enabled them to draft Anthony.\nSo it was oddly fitting that at least a few of these Nuggets, in one very disrespectful moment, at the end of another blowout loss, against Utah, channeled their inner Van Exel."}
