A Cranford man is facing drug charges after a bag of cocaine allegedly fell out of his pocket while looking for his keys after drinking with friends.

Around 3:30 a.m. Sunday, Linden police officers Nicole Melchionna and David Araque were on patrol in the Aviation Plaza shopping center, West Edgar Road, when they were flagged down by a man who told them he had been drinking with friends at a local restaurant, and noticed his keys were missing.

Police said Dominik Dziekanski, 35, then began pulling items from his pants pockets when a clear plastic bag with a white powder fell to the ground.

Police seized the bag and arrested Dziekanski. Police conducted a search and found four more bags of suspected cocaine.

Dziekanski is scheduled to appear in Union County court this week, police said.
