Advisory panels have made similar recommendations twice before, but both times the FDA has rejected them.\n\nThis time, advocates are armed with new evidence that the current voluntary guidelines don't work: A checkup of the FDA's voluntary prescribing training program this year found that only 37,517 doctors finished those programs in two years, far short of its goal of 80,000 prescribers during that time.
