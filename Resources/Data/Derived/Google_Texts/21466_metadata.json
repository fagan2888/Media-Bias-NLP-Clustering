The private equity firm plans to invest or co-invest between $3 million and $15 million per deal for acquisition financing, control buyouts, employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) leveraged buyouts or recapitalization. For more on Mosaic's ESOP activity, its area of expertise, see Recaps Turn to ESOPs.\n\nThe company targets lower middle-market businesses in the southeastern, mid-atlantic and midwestern U.S. that have more than $10 million in revenue in several sectors: business services, chemical, consumer products, environmental services, food and beverage, health care, independent distribution, material handling, niche manufacturing and third-party logistics. Mosaic also has a merchant banking affiliate, ButcherJoseph & Co., which provides it with proprietary deal flow.\n\nMosaic already has made several investments, including the Apothecary Shoppe, a compounding pharmacy in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and non-emergency medical-transportation business Express Medical Transporters, which Mosaic invested in in August.\n\nMosaic is one of several firms to close SBIC funds recently. In March, Capitala Group closed a $125 million SBIC fund, and before that the Riverside Co., in July 2014, closed a $350 million SBIC fund.
