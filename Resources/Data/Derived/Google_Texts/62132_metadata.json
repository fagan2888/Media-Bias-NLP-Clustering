But in large part, the same old uninformative stuff gets regurgitated over and over again. The gatekeepers, intent on presenting a one-sided portrayal of one of the most coordinated and funded social movements of our day, are fine with misrepresenting the news.\n\nThis is \u201cPride\u201d month for a community that enjoys the most protection of any people group by news organizations. There\u2019s no journalistic objectivity, only subjectivity drenched in happy rainbow colors and an ever-expanding acronym. The LGBT activist movement enjoys its immunity as it brands any dissenters as haters, bigots, and homophobes.\n\nI\u2019m from a family filled with diversity. I\u2019ve always been taught to love others, to be compassionate, and to speak and live the truth. Oh, and by the way, be prepared for people to hate you anyway. Little did I know, as a child, how valuable those lessons would be now.\n\nThe LGBTQ movement decries the \u201cinequality\u201d and the epidemic of \u201chate violence\u201d that touches the homosexual, bisexual and whatever-you-want-to-be-sexual community. (I\u2019m not going to go into the absurd self-cited \u201creports\u201d, pseudoscience, and trumped up statistics right now; that will have to be a whole other Radiance Foundation article). No one deserves to be physically harmed (unless it\u2019s self-defense, of course). Yet, at the same time leading \u201cgay rights\u201d groups cry \u201cdiscrimination\u201d they actively, and aggressively, promote the most violent form of discrimination: abortion. Nearly every major LGBTQxyz group (Human Rights Campaign, Act Up, Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, and GLAAD, just to name a few) promotes the violence of abortion. Many of them see \u201cgay rights\u201d and \u201cabortion rights\u201d as a united front.\n\nIn a teleconference discussing Lambda Legal\u2019s opposition to the confirmation of Chief Justice John Roberts, a participant asked the question: \u201cI looked at your 30 questions and see that several of them relate to Roe v. Wade. Why is Lambda Legal focusing on abortion? Jon Davidson, Legal Director of Lambda Legal, answered: \u201cWell, for at least a century, reproductive freedom and LGBT rights have been inextricably linked both legally and politically. The ties between these rights are so strong that we really believe that a threat to one directly and profoundly impacts the other. That is true historically.\u201d He continued: \u201cIn the early 1900s, feminist pioneers like Margaret Sanger and Emma Goldman set out to convince the public that sexual freedom and the ability to control one\u2019s reproductive destiny were intimately connected and beyond that that both were essential to individual liberty.\u201d\n\nSanger, the founder of Planned Parenthood, often discussed homosexuality. Her organization promoted it as a means to curb population. After her death, Planned Parenthood Vice President, Frederick S. Jaffe, issued what is referred to as the Jaffe Memo, which encouraged \u201cincreased homosexuality\u201d as a means to reduce U.S. fertility. The nation\u2019s soon-to-be-leading-national-abortion-chain promoted homosexuality as a means to reduce our population, not to illuminate any kind of equality or worth of an individual.\n\nYet, here we are in 2015 with multimillion-dollar gay activist organizations embracing the ideals of a racist and elitist eugenicist and an organization birthed in the pseudoscience of eugenics. Some of these groups, like Human Rights Campaign, receive funds directly from Planned Parenthood\u2014a billion dollar business that profits from the violence of abortion.\n\nPlanned Parenthood is so enmeshed in the \u201cgay rights\u201d movement; it\u2019s hard to separate the abortion chain from this political juggernaut. LGBTQPP activists, as Lambda Legal articulated, see the freedom to choose abortion and the freedom to choose sexuality as a political and inseparable marriage.\n\nACT UP, a homosexual group created to fight the horrible AIDS epidemic, boasted of this union: \u201cIn December of 1989, ACT UP made history\u2026About 4500 protestors attended the first \u2018Stop the Church\u2019 action to protest the Catholic Church\u2019s deadly, homophobic, and misogynistic AIDS and abortion policies.\u201d\n\nWhat does AIDS have to do with abortion? Well, nothing. This historic event in New York was a massive ACT UP protest against what it charged as the Catholic Church\u2019s \u201cdenial of life-saving AIDS information\u201d and its \u201copposition to a women\u2019s right to abortion.\u201d\n\nMainstream media, in collaboration with groups like the National Gay & Lesbian Journalist Association and GLAAD (Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation), make sure these \u201crights\u201d are communicated in the same breath, with the same indignant calls for \u201cequality\u201d and \u201cfreedom\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhile many of us in the LGBT community see parallels between the gay and women's rights movements, we often overlook the direct role of Roe in establishing a right to same-sex marriage\u2026Reproductive freedom and LGBT freedom are two sides of the same idea,\u201d declares GLAAD on its website. The media-focused organization\u2019s mission is, in part, to \u201ccreate a world where everyone can live the life they love.\u201d Well, everyone except those who are aborted under GLAAD\u2019s banner of \u201creproductive freedom\u201d.\n\nSadly, these groups stand in solidarity with an industry that violently discriminates thousands of times every single day and over 1 million times a year. Apparently, \u201chate speech\u201d is just fine if it calls for the death of a minority\u2014a minority more vulnerable and more victimized than any other group of human beings\u2026the unborn.\n\nI can\u2019t see the (co-opted) rainbow colors of the LGBT movement\u2019s flag without seeing the blood that drips from the fabric of its hypocrisy. You can\u2019t demand \u201cequality\u201d while proudly stripping it away from millions of others. No one should ever take pride in violence. It diminishes all of us\u2014born and unborn.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Unlimited access to the Internet and 24-hour news cycles would give one the impression that extensive information is being conveyed to the public regarding the crucial issues of our day..05/26/2016 5:38:26AM EST.", "author": "Ryan Bomberger", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Unlimited access to the Internet and 24-hour news cycles would give one the impression that extensive information is being conveyed to the public regarding the crucial issues of our day.", "title": "Ryan Bomberger - Gay Rights Groups: Taking Pride in Abortion", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/ryanbomberger/2015/06/04/gay-rights-groups-taking-pride-in-abortion-n2008117", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/143/b65135ec-b0aa-4b6e-8ec9-4f2497f7b4d9.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Unlimited access to the Internet and 24-hour news cycles would give one the impression that extensive information is being conveyed to the public regarding the crucial issues of our day.", "title": "Ryan Bomberger - Gay Rights Groups: Taking Pride in Abortion", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/ryanbomberger/2015/06/04/gay-rights-groups-taking-pride-in-abortion-n2008117", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/143/b65135ec-b0aa-4b6e-8ec9-4f2497f7b4d9.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Gay Rights Groups: Taking Pride in Abortion , Ryan Bomberger, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd0cb\"", "article_summary": "Many of them see \u201cgay rights\u201d and \u201cabortion rights\u201d as a united front.\nYet, at the same time leading \u201cgay rights\u201d groups cry \u201cdiscrimination\u201d they actively, and aggressively, promote the most violent form of discrimination: abortion.\nPlanned Parenthood is so enmeshed in the \u201cgay rights\u201d movement; it\u2019s hard to separate the abortion chain from this political juggernaut.\nSome of these groups, like Human Rights Campaign, receive funds directly from Planned Parenthood\u2014a billion dollar business that profits from the violence of abortion.\nJon Davidson, Legal Director of Lambda Legal, answered: \u201cWell, for at least a century, reproductive freedom and LGBT rights have been inextricably linked both legally and politically."}
