The centers of power are so, so in New York, Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles, that the whole rest of the country is in rebellion. And people are looking for somebody who can kick down the doors.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very deep, very real movement,\u201d he said.\n\nGingrich spent Friday on Capitol Hill promoting an initiative to make changes to Obamacare so that states can make more decisions about how to implement their own health care and insurance programs. Gingrich is working with his old colleague across the aisle, Tom Daschle, to get support for his plan. The Obama administration is coming out with new regulations on Section 1332, the part of the law that applies to \u201cstate innovation waivers.\u201d Gingrich is fighting to protect those waivers from becoming over-regulated.\n\n\u201cThese are very specific reforms, so we can actually move forward, instead of waiting until 2017 to fix some of these problems,\u201d Gingrich said.\n\n\u201cThe core idea is to return authority to the states with waivers, to give states the power to try to adapt the system to their own needs,\u201d he said. \u201cWe also have a real desire from a number of governors to create a bigger insurance market. For many small states, having one publicly controlled insurance market is not effective, because there are not enough people to justify it.\u201d Citizens can get better deals on health care in regional and multi-state markets.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a 50-50 chance.\u201d Gingrich said, when asked if he can succeed in getting the Obama administration to make some concessions when it comes out with its massive list of regulations on the waivers.\n\nGingrich is optimistic about the new Republican speaker, Paul Ryan, who was a mere conservative-movement staffer for groups like Freedomworks in Washington in the 1990\u2019s as Gingrich passed welfare reform and the balanced budget amendment.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s doing pretty well,\u201d Gingrich said of Ryan. \u201cI like the initiatives he\u2019s starting. I like how he\u2019s returning legislative authorities to the committees. I like how he\u2019s calling for entrepreneurship within the policy committees.\u201d\n\n\u201cRyan was really a proteg\u00e9 of Jack Kemp. I think the same kind of idea-oriented attitudes that characterized Jack are going to characterize Ryan.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Newt Gingrich said the country is in rebellion against the coastal power centers and Trump can \"kick down the doors\" of the establishment.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Newt Gingrich said the country is in rebellion against the coastal power centers and Trump can \"kick down the doors\" of the establishment.", "title": "Newt Gingrich: Trump Can 'Kick Down The Doors'", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/Gingrich-AP.jpg", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2015-12-12T08:13:10-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/12/11/exclusive-newt-gingrich-country-rebellion-trump-can-kick-doors/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Newt Gingrich said the country is in rebellion against the coastal power centers and Trump can \"kick down the doors\" of the establishment.", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/Gingrich-AP.jpg", "title": "Newt Gingrich: Trump Can 'Kick Down The Doors'", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Newt Gingrich,2016 Presidential Race, Big Government,Newt Gingrich", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2015-12-11T15:25:30-07:00", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "modified_time": "2015-12-12T08:13:10-07:00", "tag": "Newt Gingrich", "categories": "Big Government,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERNewt Gingrich told Breitbart News that the country is in rebellion against the coastal power centers and that Donald Trump might be the candidate who can \u201ckick down the doors\u201d of the establishment.\nAnd people are looking for somebody who can kick down the doors.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a very deep, very real movement,\u201d he said.\nThe Obama administration is coming out with new regulations on Section 1332, the part of the law that applies to \u201cstate innovation waivers.\u201d Gingrich is fighting to protect those waivers from becoming over-regulated.\n\u201cI think he\u2019s doing pretty well,\u201d Gingrich said of Ryan.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\u201cI think he represents a different era\u201d in the same conservative movement, Gingrich said."}
