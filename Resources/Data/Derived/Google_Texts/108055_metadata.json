For that reason, employers cannot unreasonably shift the financial burden of health insurance to the individual employee.\n\n\n\n\"The employer cannot charge the individual more than 9.5% of their income as a contribution to their portion of the total premium cost for single coverage,\" said Theresa Rilli, vice president of staffing firm Atrium Managed Services. \"But the cost-sharing to the employee will vary depending on their income.\"\n\n\n\nWhat's more, employers cannot categorize full-time employees as part-time in order to avoid the financial burdens of health insurance.\n\n\n\nUnder the ACA, an employee is designated as a full-time staffer if averaging 130 working hours a month over the course of five or more months. Yet if an employer misclassifies an employee to avoid providing insurance, the employer risks a $2,000 penalty. The jig is easily up when the misclassified employee secures coverage through the healthcare exchange and qualifies for the premium tax credit.\n\nAmplified Burden to Obamacare Cheats\n\nAlthough the mandate may be cumbersome, the price for misclassifying employees either deliberately or by mistake can end up costing a business a lot more money in the long run.\"The employer could be subjected to the $2,000 penalty on all full-time employees, not just that one employee to whom they didn't offer coverage,\" said Benjamin Smith, a tax expert with First Advantage who specializes in ACA compliance.", "article_metadata": {"layout": "main", "description": "Employers caught not offering healthcare coverage to full time employees could be subjected to a minimum fine of $2,000.", "author": "Juliette Fairley", "og": {"site_name": "MainStreet", "description": "Employers caught not offering healthcare coverage to full time employees could be subjected to a minimum fine of $2,000.", "title": "Affordable Care Act Penalizes Businesses For Misclassifying Workers", "url": "https://www.mainstreet.com/article/affordable-care-act-penalizes-businesses-for-misclassifying-workers", "image": {"width": 600, "secure_url": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/healthinsuranceapplication-1225.jpg", "identifier": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/healthinsuranceapplication-1225.jpg", "height": 400}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "section": "Insurance", "keywords": "jobs, unemployment, contract workers, full time staff, health care coverage, Affordable Care Act", "fb": {"app_id": 925400040808836}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MainStreet", "section": "Insurance", "tag": "Affordable Care Act", "published_time": "2015-03-03T12:14Z", "author": "https://www.mainstreet.com/author/1598405"}, "date": "2015-03-03T12:14Z", "contentType": "article", "guid": 13064006, "twitter": {"description": "Employers caught not offering healthcare coverage to full time employees could be subjected to a minimum fine of $2,000.", "title": "Affordable Care Act Penalizes Businesses For Misclassifying Workers", "url": "https://www.mainstreet.com/article/affordable-care-act-penalizes-businesses-for-misclassifying-workers", "image": {"src": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/healthinsuranceapplication-1225.jpg", "identifier": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/healthinsuranceapplication-1225.jpg"}, "site": "@mainstr", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "jobs, unemployment, contract workers, full time staff, health care coverage, Affordable Care Act"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd24e6\"", "article_summary": "ADVERTISEMENTNEW YORK (MainStreet) \u2014 The Affordable Care Act (ACA) requires businesses with 50 or more full-time employees to offer affordable health insurance, and those that don\u2019t, face hefty penalties.\nWhat's more, employers cannot categorize full-time employees as part-time in order to avoid the financial burdens of health insurance.\nFor that reason, employers cannot unreasonably shift the financial burden of health insurance to the individual employee.\nYet if an employer misclassifies an employee to avoid providing insurance, the employer risks a $2,000 penalty.\nThe jig is easily up when the misclassified employee secures coverage through the healthcare exchange and qualifies for the premium tax credit."}
