RICHMOND, Va. -- Whether you are staying close to home, or traveling far this Labor Day weekend, you're likely going to have to fill up the gas tank.

It can be pricey for drivers, especially when making trips during the summer season.

However, according to AAA Mid-Atlantic, gas prices for Labor Day weekend are the lowest that they have been in ten years.

"I think it's really nice because people are able to go out and enjoy the holiday with family and friends and they're able to afford it," said one driver.

The low prices are welcome news for most drivers.

Pamella Gambill is constantly in her car driving and said it can add up.

"It's very expensive," said Gambill, "When the prices go up I get paid mileage so the cheaper the gas the more money I make per mile."

Martha Meade with AAA Mid-Atlantic said although summer may be coming to an end, the low gas prices might not be going away.

Meade said as season demand drops off and if crude oil continues to remain low, many parts of the country could see $2 a gallon before the year's end.
