They need homes because their country had a big war, and they should be treated nicely so they don\u2019t become cruel like the people in ISIS.\n\nThe people in Syria are a lot like the people in Ireland during the famine. The same thing happened. People had to leave Ireland because they didn\u2019t have any food, and people didn\u2019t want to let them into our country. It turned out that it was a good idea to let the Irish in, because nobody was cruel and the Irish did great things for the United States.\n\nJust because somebody is a Muslim doesn\u2019t mean that they are cruel. In fact, it could mean that they are nice and that they want to do great things as soon as they are able to. It would be like what happened with Ireland and America, except with Syria and America.\n\nAnd so, as I said at the beginning, will you please let some Syrian refugees into Oklahoma? It\u2019s your choice.\n\nSincerely,\n\nDorothy Marguerite Cusack (6 years old)", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "A young Oklahoma girl speaks out asking Governor Mary Fallin to allow Syrian refugees to move to our state.", "og": {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/30575259/young-girls-letter-to-gov-fallin-requests-help-for-syrian-refugees", "image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/9305750_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A young Oklahoma girl speaks out asking Governor Mary Fallin to allow Syrian refugees to move to our state.", "title": "Young Girl's Letter To Gov.
