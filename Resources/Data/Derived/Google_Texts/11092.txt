A 27-year-old Denver man with a history of violence and bad driving faces vehicular-homicide charges after a Christmas-morning crash that left a woman dead and injured three members of her family.

Police said Johnny Gilbert, who also was injured in the collision, ran away from the wreckage, but officers tracked him down in a little more than an hour.

The name of the woman, who died at a local hospital, has not been released.

A family of four was in the minivan that was struck. One child has serious injuries, while another child and a man sustained minor injuries, Detective Raquel Lopez said.

The crash happened at East 51st Avenue and Peoria Street shortly after midnight. The accident, in which an SUV hit the minivan, closed streets in the area.

Police announced at 2:05 a.m. that a suspect had been arrested. The location of the arrest was not released Wednesday afternoon.

After being treated at a hospital, Gilbert was detained by police and was likely to face charges of vehicular homicide, vehicular assault, and felony hit and run, police said.

Gilbert has a criminal history, police records show.

In 1996, Aurora police arrested him on charges of aggravated robbery with the use of a deadly weapon, first-degree assault and criminal conspiracy. He was sentenced to 10 years in state prison, records indicate.

In 2004, he was cited in Denver for driving under restraint, driving without proof of insurance and driving without a valid driver’s license, but the charges were dropped.

In 2003, he was found guilty of driving under restraint in Denver.

In 1996, he was charged with a handful of driving offenses — including hit-and-run on an unattended vehicle and driving without insurance — but the disposition of those cases were not clear in public records.
