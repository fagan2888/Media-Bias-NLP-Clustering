An accelerating trend of proposed double-digit health insurance premium increases \u2014 some topping 50 percent \u2014 suggests that the answer is yes.\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act (ACA), insurers participating in the law\u2019s exchanges who wish to raise their rates by more than 10 percent year-over-year must submit their proposed rate increases for review by either state or federal regulators. Those bureaucrats must decide by August whether to approve or deny requests for the following year.\n\nThirty-seven states plus the District of Columbia have released data on individual plans on the exchanges. An analysis of the data by David Hogberg of the National Center for Public Policy Research reveals that insurers are seeking high premium increases on far more plans in 2016 than in 2015 \u2014 and the rate hikes themselves are significantly steeper.\n\nIn 2015, insurers asked for rate hikes of 10 percent or more for 121 exchange policies. Of these, 21 requested an increase of at least 20 percent, while 9 requested an increase of at least 30 percent.\n\nFor 2016, however, the number of requests for double-digit increases nearly doubled, to 231 policies. Of these, 126 sought a hike of 20 percent or more, and 61 sought a hike of 30 percent or more. And whereas no insurers requested increases of 40 percent or higher last year, for 2016 they are asking for 26 policies to go up by at least 40 percent and 12 to jump by at least 50 percent.\n\nWhy are insurers looking to boost premiums so much next year? Simply put, their costs have increased faster than their revenue. According to CNSNews.com, Aetna justified its proposed 59.7-percent rate hike for a Virginia plan by explaining, \u201cMedical costs are going up and we are changing our rates to reflect this increase,\u201d adding that \u201cseveral requirements related to the Affordable Care Act (ACA) also impact these rates.\u201d Blue Cross Blue Shield of Minnesota, requesting a 55.8-percent increase for one of its plans, stated: \u201cIn 2014, the ratio of claims to revenue received (excluding potential federal risk corridor payments) exceeded 115% and resulted in an operating loss in excess of $135 million.\u201d\n\nCosts have increased for a variety of reasons, but ObamaCare is one of the primary ones. \u201cGreater use of health services as well as more people covered by the ACA appear to be responsible for most of the increase,\u201d Kaiser Family Foundation president and CEO Drew Altman blogged for the Wall Street Journal. Undoubtedly the wider coverage has driven much of the increase in the use of health services, and with people with costly pre-existing conditions now guaranteed coverage (as long as they pay their premiums), insurers are having to fork over benefits for more \u2014 and more expensive \u2014 treatments. At the same time, they aren\u2019t permitted to charge sicker people higher rates than healthier ones, so they end up in the hole.\n\nThe \u201crisk corridors\u201d referenced by Blue Cross Blue Shield were supposed to help mitigate this problem. \u201cThe risk corridor is a three-year program under which insurers on the exchanges who make a profit are required to share some of those profits with insurers who took losses on the exchanges,\u201d Hogberg wrote in an article for the Federalist. \u201cHowever, if there are not enough profit-makers to cover the losses, then the taxpayers would step in to cover the difference.\u201d\n\nWhen it began to look as if taxpayers could be in for a billion-dollar insurance-company bailout last year \u2014 last summer, only one exchange insurer told a congressional committee it expected to turn a profit, while others reported significant losses \u2014 Congress put the kibosh on any taxpayer funding of the risk corridors. Insurers, who had priced their policies with the expectation of a bailout, were now stuck with insufficient revenue to cover costs. This year, with a better understanding of their costs under ObamaCare and no expectation of risk-corridor cash, insurers are pricing their plans accordingly, leading to the huge rate hikes.\n\nLarge premium increases, of course, will make insurance less affordable for many, even those eligible for subsidies. Those who least need coverage, especially at high rates, will likely drop it or switch to lower-cost plans, leaving sicker individuals on the high-cost plans, which will then have to raise their rates again in subsequent years \u2014 the classic \u201cdeath spiral.\u201d\n\n\u201cOver time,\u201d observed Hogberg,\n\none of two things will happen to such insurers. Some of their sicker customers will find the constant rate hikes too much and will seek cheaper insurance. Alternatively, the insurers will sustain big losses and eventually exit the market. Their sicker customers will then have little option but to take their business to less costly insurers. Once either of those scenarios happen [sic], those cheaper insurers won\u2019t be cheap for very long.\n\nThis is already happening to Time Insurance. Time, a subsidiary of Assurant, is asking for some of the biggest rate hikes among insurers for 2016. Its average premium increase of about 52 percent suggests that its risk pool is heavy on the older and sicker customers. It is likely a big reason Assurant is trying to sell its health insurance business. Even if it can\u2019t, Assurant says it will be out of the health insurance market by the end of 2016. Its sicker customers will have to go somewhere, and the unlucky insurers that receive them will eventually have to hike their rates too.\n\nObamaCare boosters have argued that the huge premium jumps being requested are nothing about which to be concerned because regulators won\u2019t allow them to take effect. Hogberg, however, pointed out that last year all but four exchanges approved every requested rate increase, and the other four each denied just one request. Moreover, he noted, if regulators do deny proposed rate hikes, forcing them down to politically palatable levels, the insurers who requested them will end up incurring big losses again in 2016 and may eventually leave the exchange altogether. \u201cFewer insurers means less competition, which will cause premiums to rise even more in the long run,\u201d he wrote.\n\nIn other words, whether or not rates are allowed to rise as fast as insurers desire, the exchanges are headed for trouble. This was perfectly predictable, even by politicians who thought the ACA was a good idea \u2014 hence the subsidies, risk corridors, and other kludges designed to mask the problem for as long as possible.\n\n\u201cIn the end,\u201d Hogberg said in a statement, \u201cthe exchanges are not sustainable, and free-market based reform of our health care system will be necessary.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "ObamaCare, insurance, rate hikes", "og": {"url": "http://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/health-care/item/21221-big-insurance-rate-hikes-may-portend-obamacare-death-spiral", "image": "http://www.thenewamerican.com/media/k2/items/cache/ba53d159b78a3e92eaf66dc61023cddb_XL.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Health insurers are seeking double-digit rate increases for many ObamaCare exchange plans, suggesting that the exchanges are already entering a \"death spiral\" of high costs and losses.
