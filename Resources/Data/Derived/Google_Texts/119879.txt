Hillary channels Madame Mao: 'deep-seated cultural codes, religious beliefs and structural biases have to be changed'

Barack Obama was a piker when he wrote about audacity. Hillary Clinton seems to be calling for nothing less than a Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the United States, mimicking Mao Zedong’s wife Jiang Qing, who sought to overturn millennia of Chinese culture in order to impose a communist paradise through the Cultural Revolution. But of course, Hillary was urging the rejection of our religious and cultural heritage in order to facilitate the killing of unborn children. Kerry Pickett of The Daily Caller reports:

Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton took a feminist tone on Thursday. She told attendees at the sixth annual Women in The World Summit that “deep-seated cultural codes, religious beliefs and structural biases have to be changed” for the sake of giving women access to “reproductive health care and safe childbirth.” “Far too many women are denied access to reproductive health care and safe childbirth, and laws don’t count for much if they’re not enforced. Rights have to exist in practice — not just on paper,” Clinton said. So those religious beliefs protected by the Constitution’s First Amendment: sorry, they have to be changed. There are babies to be killed. But before Hillary goes any farther down the Jiang Qing path, she might want to consider the fate of her cultural revolutionary model. After Mao died, Jiang had few allies, her arrogance catching up to her. She was imprisoned, tried, and sentenced to death. But that was commuted to life imprisonment. Eventually she developed throat cancer and was released on humanitarian grounds. When free, she committed suicide. Her name has gone down in Chinese history as representing villainy. On second thought, keep talking, Hillary.
