In a recent Affordable Care Act promotional video produced for the website Buzzfeed, President Barack Obama uses his index finger and thumb to form a finger gun and aim it at the viewer. Apparently, the commander-in-chief has not been briefed on the supposedly anti-social, threatening, and disruptive nature of this gesture, so we are here to help.\n\nThen the nation\u2019s oldest and most prominent gun rights organization described the president\u2019s actions.\n\nThe video, entitled, \u201cThings Everybody Does But Doesn\u2019t Talk About,\u201d features Obama engaging in various silly activities aimed at portraying him as a regular person, in order to promote his healthcare program. At the beginning of the video, the president is positioned in front of a mirror. After some prolonged mugging, he dons a pair of sunglasses and wields a finger gun at the camera, as if showing off his best secret agent impression.\n\nBut, that same innocent act of clowning around has gotten many a grade-schooler in hot water. The NRA lists numerous examples before citing this most egregious case \u2014 one where \u201cclowning around\u201d wasn\u2019t even a factor.\n\nPerhaps most appalling, in 2012, the parents of a 3-year-old deaf preschooler named Hunter Spanjer were told by school officials in Grand Island, Neb., that Hunter\u2019s sign language name was inappropriate for school. Hunter signs his name by extending and crossing his index and middle fingers, which produces an appearance akin to that of a finger gun. The school system eventually backed down after media coverage of the incident provoked a public outcry, and the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Association of the Deaf got involved.\n\nThe organization went on to describe the inroads they\u2019ve been making with individual state legislatures to stop the enforcement of such \u201czero tolerance\u201d policies in public schools. The NRA noted success in Florida with it\u2019s \u201cRight To Be A Kid Act,\u201d and remarked that \u201clawmakers in Oklahoma, Texas, and Nevada have pursued similar legislation.\u201d\n\nAfter all, the NRA observes, \u201cimaginary gun gestures made in good fun or during imaginative play are perfectly normal and acceptable behavior, even for the leader of the free world.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "BizPac Review", "description": "The National Rifle Association\u2019s Institute for Legislative Action is using one of President Obama\u2019s recent \u201cclowning around\u201d videos to make a point: Schools should stick to education and stop with the politically-correct gun malarky.
