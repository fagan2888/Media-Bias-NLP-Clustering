(WRIC) \u2014 Virginia has joined a coalition of 16 states and the District of Columbia, Attorney General Mark R. Herring announced Friday in a friend-of-the-court brief in the U.S. Supreme Court case of Zubik, et al. v. Burwell et al.\n\nHerring is urging the court to protect women\u2019s access to contraceptive coverage under the Affordable Care Act (ACA).\n\n\u201cVirginia women should never have affordable access to contraception and family planning controlled by their employer,\u201d said Attorney General Herring. \u201cThe law allows women to access the full range of healthcare services they are entitled to while still respecting the religious liberties of faith-based organizations, and I hope the Supreme Court will uphold this reasonable balance and accommodation.\u201d\n\nThe ACA provides an accommodation for religious nonprofit organizations that object to its requirement that employer-provided health insurance plans contain coverage for preventative healthcare, including contraception. The accommodation allows these organizations to opt out of providing contraceptive coverage to their employees by informing their insurance company or the federal government of their objection. If an organization opts out, the insurer will then provide contraceptive coverage directly to employees at the insurance companies own expense.\n\nIn the Zubik case, several nonprofit religious organizations filed suit against Sylvia Burwell, Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, arguing that this opt-out accommodation violates their religious beliefs.\n\nAttorney General Herring and the 17 other attorneys general argue in the brief that the court should not interpret the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) in a way that defeats and interferes with the \u201cessential and compelling purposes of the ACA and its preventative contraceptive healthcare coverage requirements,\u201d a news release from Herring\u2019s office reads.\n\nThe brief notes that access to contraceptives is essential for public health and is consistent with Congress\u2019 intent in passing the ACA to ensure that all covered employees have access to no-cost preventive care, free of barriers.\n\n\u201cThe brief argues that the ACA\u2019s opt-out accommodation does not create a substantial burden and therefore does not interfere with or violate the rights of these organizations under RFRA. The brief also argues that the alternatives to this common-sense accommodation proposed by the religious employers would impose significant financial, logistical, informational, and administrative burdens on women seeking access to contraception,\u201d the release reads. \u201cThese burdens would fall hardest on women with the fewest informational and financial resources to overcome them.\u201d\n\nThe brief also urges the court to interpret RFRA in a manner that wouldn\u2019t interfere with states\u2019 goals to protect public health and promote gender equity. California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and D.C. all joined the coalition.\n\nIn January 2106, Attorney General Herring joined 13 other states and the District of Columbia in signing a friend-of-the-court brief in the case of Whole Woman\u2019s Health v. Cole, urging the U.S. Supreme Court to reverse a lower court decision that would substantially restricting access to abortion services in Texas.\n\nIn 2015, Attorney General Herring led a coalition of 23 states in helping to successfully defend access to affordable healthcare on the federal healthcare exchanges. Healthcare affordability assistance averaging $3,000 was threatened for hundreds of thousands of Virginians and millions of Americans. Virginia successfully argued for the right of its citizens to access the same affordability assistance that residents in other states receive in the federal district court, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, and ultimately the U.S. Supreme Court.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Attorney General Mark Herring is urging the court to protect women's access to contraceptive coverage under the Affordable Care Act.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.mediageneral.wric", "og": {"site_name": "WRIC", "description": "Attorney General Mark Herring is urging the court to protect women\u2019s access to contraceptive coverage under the Affordable Care Act.", "title": "Va. joins in fight to protect contraception access under the Affordable Care Act", "url": "http://wric.com/2016/02/19/virginia-joins-coalition-of-states-in-fight-to-protect-contraception-access/", "image": {"width": 660, "identifier": "https://mgtvwric.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/ap_0005040845.jpg?w=1200", "height": 371}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Attorney General Mark Herring is urging the court to protect women\u2019s access to contraceptive coverage under the Affordable Care Act.", "creator": "@8News", "image": {"src": "https://mgtvwric.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/ap_0005040845.jpg?w=640"}, "title": "Va. joins in fight to protect contraception access under the Affordable Care Act", "site": "https://twitter.com/8NEWS", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "25404283363C09DE121A55A903F03873", "msapplication-tooltip": "8NEWS - WRIC | News Where You Live", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=546021203", "fb": {"pages": 54179888378}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "application-name": "WRIC", "google-site-verification": "4JVTVIu6T7ApYpmYwIYYL-f8hv25jbgKKaPFZc39M5c", "keywords": "Birth control, local Local News, News", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/8News", "published_time": "2016-02-19T13:47:40+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-19T13:51:11+00:00"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://wric.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/df39282cf6eb67f902e8c8c95cd35698?s=16"}, "article_summary": "\u201cVirginia women should never have affordable access to contraception and family planning controlled by their employer,\u201d said Attorney General Herring.\nHerring is urging the court to protect women\u2019s access to contraceptive coverage under the Affordable Care Act (ACA).\nIn 2015, Attorney General Herring led a coalition of 23 states in helping to successfully defend access to affordable healthcare on the federal healthcare exchanges.\nIn the Zubik case, several nonprofit religious organizations filed suit against Sylvia Burwell, Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, arguing that this opt-out accommodation violates their religious beliefs.\nHealthcare affordability assistance averaging $3,000 was threatened for hundreds of thousands of Virginians and millions of Americans."}
