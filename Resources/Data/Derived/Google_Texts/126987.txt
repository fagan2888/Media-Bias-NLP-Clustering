The HR benefits module provides a complete workflow to manage employee health and medical benefits

Plexxis is proud to announce the launch of the most robust benefits tracking system available for the wall and ceiling industry. The HR benefits module provides a complete workflow to manage employee health and medical benefits including easy to use administrative tools to set health benefits offered to the employees, manage employee enrollments, track coverage changes, and generate 1095 forms at the end of the year.

Chad Pearson, Director of Business Development says; “Soon the IRS will require companies to be Affordable Care Act compliant. This will be a significant task for all sized companies as the forms need to be produced and filed for each employee. We are proud to have significantly simplified this task for our customers”.
