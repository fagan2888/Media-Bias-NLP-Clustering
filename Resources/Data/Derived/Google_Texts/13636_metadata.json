He missed the first 11 races of the season, then returned in late May determined to earn a berth in NASCAR\u2019s championship playoffs.\n\nBusch needs only to finish in the top 30 in the regular-season standings to earn a spot in the 16-driver Chase for the Sprint Cup field. Busch won races at Sonoma Raceway and last week at Kentucky Speedway and is 33rd in the standings, 58 points behind David Gilliland for 30th.\n\nBrad Keselowski was second, followed by Kevin Harvick, Joey Logano and Dale Earnhardt Jr.\n\nBusch said Friday he still is bothered by the leg injuries. They hardly seemed to matter in the No. 18 Toyota.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to keep doing our deal,\u201d Busch said. \u201cEvery week it keeps getting better and better.\u201d\n\nBusch has gained 70 points on the 30th spot over the last two races and is not only a threat to qualify for the Chase, but to win it all for Joe Gibbs Racing should he crack the field.\n\n\u201cEver since that injury, he\u2019s been on it,\u201d Gibbs said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what [the deficit is] now but it\u2019s sure helping.\u201d\n\nHe still must rank inside the top 30 in points to make the Chase. He has seven races left to crack the top 30 before the Chase opens Sept. 20 at Chicagoland Speedway.\n\nBusch was joined by son Brexton, born in late May, in victory lane wearing a No. 18 outfit.\n\nBusch had one of his best performances in his comeback, rallying from a lap down to win. Busch, who led 95 laps, stayed out during a late pit stop to take the lead from contenders Keselowski and Matt Kenseth. Crew chief Adam Stevens, in his first season calling the shots for Busch, made all the right choices to keep Busch in contention for the win.\n\nHe also made it 12 different winners at the last 12 New Hampshire races, the longest active streak at any track without a multiple-race winner in NASCAR.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Busch won for the second consecutive weekend and the third time in the last four Sprint Cup races when he took the checkered flag at New Hampshire on Sunday.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Busch won for the second consecutive weekend and the third time in the last four Sprint Cup races when he took the checkered flag at New Hampshire on Sunday.", "title": "Kyle Busch continues comeback from injuries with victory at New Hampshire", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jul/19/kyle-busch-comeback-injuries-victory-new-hampshire/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/07/19/AP_431297267730.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/07/19/AP_431297267730.jpg", "description": "Busch won for the second consecutive weekend and the third time in the last four Sprint Cup races when he took the checkered flag at New Hampshire on Sunday.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Kyle Busch continues comeback from injuries with victory at New Hampsh"}, "Author": "Dan Gelston", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Kyle Busch, Nascar, Joey Logano"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9f58\"", "article_summary": "LOUDON, N.H. \u2014 Kyle Busch continues to find victory lane and is moving closer to landing a spot in the Chase.\nBusch won races at Sonoma Raceway and last week at Kentucky Speedway and is 33rd in the standings, 58 points behind David Gilliland for 30th.\nCrew chief Adam Stevens, in his first season calling the shots for Busch, made all the right choices to keep Busch in contention for the win.\nBusch had one of his best performances in his comeback, rallying from a lap down to win.\nBusch was joined by son Brexton, born in late May, in victory lane wearing a No."}
