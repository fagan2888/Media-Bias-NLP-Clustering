Kubiak replaces Jim Caldwell, who was hired on Jan. 14 to coach the Detroit Lions.\n\nThe 52-year-old Kubiak was Houston\u2019s coach from 2006 through last month, when he was fired after the Texans got off to a 2-11 start.\n\nBaltimore also announced the hiring of Rick Dennison, the Texans former offensive coordinator, as their quarterbacks coach.\n\nAn extensive search for Caldwell\u2019s replacement began with 30 candidates, coach John Harbaugh said. The search ended with the Ravens landing Kubiak, who served as Denver\u2019s offensive coordinator for three seasons before being hired to guide the Texans in 2006.\n\n\u201cIt became apparent this had a chance to be a fit for both coaches and the Ravens,\u201d Harbaugh said.\n\nKubiak might want to have a team to call his own in the future, but at this point in his NFL career he\u2019s quite content being in charge of reshaping a unit that sputtered for much of the 2013 season.\n\n\u201cRight now I want to be the best offensive coordinator I can be,\u201d Kubiak said. \u201cI told John this when he first called me: I said, \u2018John, you know what? I want a chance to enjoy coaching, teaching, and I want a chance to win. And I know you would offer me all those opportunities if this thing would work out. So, really for me it\u2019s about getting back. It\u2019s a tough thing to go through. But right now, this has been the best day I\u2019ve had in two months. I\u2019m so excited to get back in this league and get back to work.\u201d\n\nRhonda Kubiak was likely just as delighted.\n\n\u201cMy wife is tired of me being around the house,\u201d said Gary Kubiak, who went 61-64 as Houston\u2019s head coach.\n\nDuring his stay in Houston, the Texans always played Baltimore tough, and that made an impression on Harbaugh.\n\n\u201cYou always kind of in your mind keep a list of the guys that gave you the most trouble as coaches,\u201d Harbaugh said. \u201cAnd this (Houston) staff, what they did offensively, what they\u2019ve done over the years has always been just kind of a pain in our rear. Probably right out of the gates, that\u2019s the first thing I thought about. It looks like all the ways that we want to look.\u201d\n\nKubiak and Dennison will try to bolster a running attack that produced only seven touchdowns and averaged a franchise-worst 3.1 yards per carry in 2013. In addition, Joe Flacco threw a career-high 22 interceptions as the defending Super Bowl champions sagged to 8-8 and missed the playoffs for the first time in Harbaugh\u2019s six seasons as Baltimore\u2019s coach.\n\nThe addition of Kubiak and Dennison in key positions on the offensive staff might suggest the playbook will be look much like Houston\u2019s. Harbaugh doesn\u2019t care \u2014 if the results are positive.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to be the Texans\u2019 offense or the Broncos\u2019 offense or anybody\u2019s offense. It\u2019s going to be the Ravens,\u201d Harbaugh said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be what we build with our players and our coaches. It\u2019s going to look like Baltimore wants it to look. It\u2019s going to be rugged, it\u2019s going to be rough, it\u2019s going to be tough, physical, downhill, precise football \u2014 passing game and running game.\u201d\n\nFormer Redskins offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan and Ravens receivers coach Jim Hostler were interviewed twice for the job, along with Pittsburgh Steelers running backs coach Kirby Wilson.\n\nWilson was eliminated from contention on Saturday.\n\nWhen Kubiak had dinner at Harbaugh\u2019s house on Sunday night, it became obvious that Kubiak was going back to work and Harbaugh had found the man to fix the erratic Baltimore offense.\n\n\u201cIt emerged here at the end,\u201d Harbaugh said. \u201cI think we did a great job with a thorough process. That was something that was important to us, to make sure we turned over every stone. We looked at college coaches. We looked at a lot of guys.\u201d\n\nIn the end, Kubiak got the nod after being unemployed for just under two months.\n\n\u201cI wanted to keep working, I wanted to keep going,\u201d Kubiak said. \u201cI was kind of looking for something that hit me and said, \u2018OK, this is it.\u2019 And that\u2019s what happened.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The 52-year-old Kubiak replaces Jim Caldwell, who left to become coach of the Detroit Lions.
