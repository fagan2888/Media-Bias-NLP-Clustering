Speaking of Serra, the pope said: \u201cHe was the evangelizer of the West in the United States.\u201d The same institution that brought us the Crusades, a Borgia Pope and the Inquisition is now going to sanctify Serra\u2019s legacy.\n\nHow are we to understand the context of Serra\u2019s founding of the \u201cevangelizing\u201d Spanish Catholic mission system in 1769, in what Spain then called \u201cAlta California\u201d? In his comprehensive book A Violent Evangelism: The Political and Religious Conquest of the Americas (1992), theologian Luis Rivera-Pag\u00e1n, says: \u201cTruly the Spanish conquerors of the Americas were driven by their quest for God, gold, and glory. But it was the language related to God\u2014theology\u2014that served to rationalize avarice and ambition, not vice versa.\u201d (p. xv) He continues: \u201cIt was religion that attempted to sacralize [make sacred] political domination and economic exploitation.\u201d (Ibid)\n\nThe word \u201cevangelization,\u201d used by Pope Francis, traces to \u201cbringing the good news of a military victory.\u201d That a war analogy and a bid for \u201cconquest\u201d is apt for Serra\u2019s era of evangelism is documented by a joint statement made in California in 1773 by the Dominican and Franciscan Orders of the Catholic Church. In his book The Missions and Missionaries of California, Vol. I, (Mission Santa Barbara, 1928), Father Zephyrin Englehardt quotes the joint Dominican-Franciscan statement. It opens by invoking the names of the founders of their religious orders, whom they called \u201cour holy Patriarchs, Dominic de Guzman and Francis of Assisi.\u201d Assisi, of course, is the Catholic religious figure and saint, whose name Pope Francis chose for his papacy.\n\nAs the document continues, the religious orders talk of \u201cfinding ourselves in this corner of the world of Old and New California, occupied with the spiritual conquest and the conversion of the infidels\u2026\u201d (p. 524). The word \u201cconquest\u201d is accurately re-expressed as \u201cdomination.\u201d\n\nA genocidal system of violent evangelism and domination was the means of achieving what the Mexican scholar Manuel Serrano y Sanz called \u201cSpanish domination in America.\u201d (Or\u00edgines de la dominaci\u00f3n espa\u00f1ola en Am\u00e9rica, Madrid, 1918). This historical reality informed the title of the 1987 book The Missions of California: A Legacy of Genocide, by Rupert Costo (Luise\u00f1o) and Jeanette Costo. It was published as part of the fierce debate that took place over the proposed beatification of Father Serra in the 1980s.\n\nThe Catholic Church worked to achieve the spiritual conquest of infidels by means of temporal political domination of Church and State, the Cross and the Sword, over \u201cthe infidels.\u201d Such domination is what Pope Francis\u2019s predecessor Pope Alexander VI laid the path for with his papal bull documents from 1493. Those documents called for \u201cthe propagation of the Christian empire\u201d and for non-Christian \u201cbarbarous nations\u201d to be \u201creduced\u201d to the Catholic faith and Christian religion. A papal bull from May 3, 1493 declared that the Spanish monarchs were authorized to take over any lands, discovered and to be discovered, that were not under the domination of any Christian dominator (\u201csub dominio actuali temporali aliquorum dominorum christianorum constitute non essent\u2026\u201d).\n\nJunipero Serra\u2019s efforts at evangelization were undertaken in furtherance of the objectives set forth in papal documents of the Holy See. Evangelization was one means of extending the religio-political Spanish Catholic system of domination into the lands and territories of the original and independent Native nations of the continent and the hemisphere throughout \u201cthe Americas.\u201d\n\nPope Francis is a member of the Jesuit Order. A biography about Father Juan Salvatierra, who was also a member of the Jesuit Order, sheds light on the nature and legacy of the Spanish Catholic system that Pope Francis is celebrating by declaring Father Serra to be a Catholic saint. The book\u2019s title is Juan Mar\u00eda de Salvatierra of the Company of Jesus, Missionary of the Province of New Spain, and Apostolic Conqueror of the Californias, by Miguel Venegas (Arthur H. Clark Company, 1929).\n\nThe book was originally published in Spanish in 1754. Marguerite Eyer Wilbur provided the 1929 English translation. As expressed in English, the original title page of the book reads in part: \u201cWritten learnedly and in detail by Father Miguel Venegas, Professed of the four Vows, of this same Company [of Jesus] and condensed into a brief compendium by Father Juan Antonio De Oviedo, Rector of the College of San Andres in Mexico, and Censor for the Holy Inquisition.\u201d\n\nThe original title page in Spanish reads: \u201cQuien La Dedica A Maria Santissima Madre de Dios, Reyna de todo los Santos, Senora de los Exercitos, y Conquistadora de nuevos Reynos en su Sagrada Imagen De Loreto.\u201d This translates in English as follows: \u201cBy whom it [the book] is dedicated to the Most Holy Mary Mother of God, Queen of all the Saints Lady of Armies and Conqueress of new Kingdoms in her Holy Image of Loreto.\u201d (pp. 48-49)\n\nPope Francis\u2019s decision to grant sainthood to Father Serra by canonizing him celebrates the genocidal legacy of the Spanish Catholic mission system of domination. Pope Alexander VI unleashed that devastating system on our Original Nations shortly after Cristobal Col\u00f3n made a successful voyage from Spain to the Caribbean and back. The pope\u2019s decision to canonize Serra constitutes a celebration by the Holy See of the empire of Christendom, and its efforts to achieve the \u201cspiritual conquest\u201d (domination) of our \u201cinfidel\u201d ancestors, in the name of \u201cthe Prince of Peace.\u201d\n\nRobert Jackson, in \u201cThe Dynamic of Indians Demographic Collapse in the Mission Communities in Northwestern New Spain (1990),\u201d gave a grim sense of the devastation of the Spanish Catholic Mission system: \u201cFinally, more than 90% of the children born in the missions died before reaching age ten.\u201d In his sampling of the Baja and Alta California missions, Jackson stated: \u201cIn other words, the population of the seven Baja California [mission] establishments experienced a mean rate of 83 percent [population] decline, and 90 percent in the Alta California missions.\u201d The life expectancy at birth, he said, was 7.4 years for the seven Baja California mission[s], and 4.5 years for\u202620 Alta California establishments.\u201d\n\nGiven the unsaintly and deadly toll that Father Serra\u2019s Catholic mission system had on Native Nations and families in Alta California, it is a cruel irony that Pope Francis will finalize his canonization of Father Serra during the World Meeting of Families, in \u201cthe city of Brotherly love,\u201d in the territory of our Lenape Nation.\n\nSteven Newcomb (Shawnee, Lenape) is co-founder and co-director of the Indigenous Law Institute and author of Pagans in the Promised Land: Decoding the Doctrine of Christian Discovery (Fulcrum, 2008).
