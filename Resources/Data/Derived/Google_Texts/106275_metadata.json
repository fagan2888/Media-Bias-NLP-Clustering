The other clinics are in East Orlando and Apopka.\n\nThe clinic provides free medications for patients leaving the hospital.\n\n\u201cWe work with several pharmaceutical companies or partner with them to get the medications people need for a full year at no cost,\u201d said Ed Fluker, administrative director of respiratory care at Florida Hospital Orlando. \u201cWhich really is a blessing because many of these patients need medications that cost between $600 and $800 per month.\u201d\n\nOfficials said $4 million in free care has been provided at the clinics so far.\n\n\u201cWe were able to show a reduction of 52 percent in their emergency room visits and 58 percent in their hospital admissions,\u201d Fluker said. \u201cSo that\u2019s really saying a lot about how we\u2019re improving the health and quality of life for the patient, but there is a benefit to the hospital as well as the community.\u201d\n\nReporter Abe Aboraya is a reporter with WMFE in Orlando.
