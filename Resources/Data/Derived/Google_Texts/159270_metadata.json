People can visit City Hall offices at the original building Monday.\n\nMost city offices have been temporarily set up in the Aberdeen Parks, Recreation & Forestry building. City employees like Alan Rohlman say they're ready to move from their temporary spots to permanent offices.\n\n\"This has been home for us for a lot of years and we just want to get back home,\" Rohlman said.\n\nContractors started gutting the old City Hall building about a year ago. The renovation includes a lot of new construction but the city embraced original components, including stained glass and marble.\n\n\"That is the stuff that we wanted to carry through to the new building and make sure that we didn't lose that character,\" city engineer Robin Bobzien said.\n\nIf any of it didn't fit with the building's new layout, the city worked to recycle it. Some old marble had to come out during the renovation but it's being reused in the new Aberdeen City Council chamber.\n\nSome of the city offices are in similar locations, but other rooms have moved. City leaders are saying employees and the public will have to be patient as everyone adjusts to the renovated building.\n\nRohlman says the new layout functions well and added modern touches will help city offices that will still noticeably sit in a 100-year-old building.\n\n\"We can get individuals, all the patrons' needs met but they'll still be able to see the aesthetic value of the hallways, the pillars and the staircase itself,\" Rohlman said.\n\nContractors ran into some surprises because of the building's age and some past renovations that hadn't been fully documented, Bobzien said. Still, the total cost was about $3 million, which is what the city had budgeted.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "KELOLAND News", "description": "Offices at Aberdeen City Hall will be closed the next two days for a long-awaited move.
