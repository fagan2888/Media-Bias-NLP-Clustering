SCOTIA, N.Y. (AP) â€” Looking to upset Donald Trump in his home state, Ted Cruz is telling voters in upstate New York that recent primary victories in Wisconsin and Utah are giving him momentum ahead of the state's April 19 primary.

The Republican senator from Texas spoke Thursday in the packed gym at a Christian school just outside of Schenectady.

Cruz says endorsements from former GOP candidates and party leaders show the party is uniting behind him as the only candidate capable of winning a matchup with Democrat Hillary Clinton.

He won big applause by promising to repeal the Affordable Care Act and eliminate the IRS.

He says the race is as much about the Supreme Court as the presidency, with the winner likely to pick a justice that could set the court's direction for decades.
