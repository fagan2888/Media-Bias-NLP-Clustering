South Korea has had no human cases.\n\nAvian flu is an infectious viral disease of birds. Most bird flu viruses do not infect humans, but some have caused serious infections in humans.\n\nTwo strains of avian influenza - H5N2 and H5N8 - have been confirmed in wild birds in Washington state, near the U.S. border with Canada, but there was no immediate cause for public health concerns, U.S. agriculture officials said on Wednesday.\n\nNeither virus has been found in U.S. commercial poultry.\n\nSouth Korea's imports from the United States in the first 11 months of the year included 63,245 tonnes of poultry meat and 264,000 chicks, according to ministry data.\n\nThe ministry said the import suspension would not cause a shortage as domestic poultry meat supply is projected to rise by 17.5 percent to 67,000 tonnes this month from a year earlier on top of 9,000 tonnes in inventory.\n\n(Reporting by Meeyoung Cho; Editing by Robert Birsel)", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "south, korea, halts, us, poultry, imports, due, bird, flu, us", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "South Korea has suspended imports of all U.S. poultry and poultry products after an outbreak of bird flu was found in wild birds in Washington.", "title": "South Korea Halts US Poultry Imports Due To Bird Flu In US", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/south-korea-halts-us-poultry-imports-due-bird-flu-us-315142", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/21/chickens.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "South Korea has suspended imports of all U.S. poultry and poultry products after an outbreak of bird flu was found in wild birds in Washington.", "title": "South Korea Halts US Poultry Imports Due To Bird Flu In US", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/south-korea-halts-us-poultry-imports-due-bird-flu-us-315142", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/21/chickens.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/21/chickens.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2014-12-21T11:24:14-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-21T11:24:13-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "South Korea has suspended imports of all U.S. poultry and poultry products after an outbreak of bird flu was found in wild birds in Washington."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb624\"", "article_summary": "South Korea has suspended imports of all U.S. poultry and poultry products after an outbreak of bird flu was found in wild birds in Washington.\nThe suspension, from Saturday, comes as South Korea is struggling to contain its own outbreak of bird flu in birds.\nSEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea has suspended imports of U.S. poultry and poultry products because of an outbreak of bird flu in the United States, the Agriculture Ministry said in a statement on Sunday.\nMost bird flu viruses do not infect humans, but some have caused serious infections in humans.\nSouth Korea has had no human cases."}
