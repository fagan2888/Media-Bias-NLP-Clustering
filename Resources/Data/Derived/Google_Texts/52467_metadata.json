As our troops have moved away from more remote areas to larger bases that are closer to big cities, the Islamic State has found an opportunity to expand into the country.\n\nU.S. and Afghan officials say ISIS is now in three provinces in Afghanistan, and over the weekend, Afghan warlord Gulbuddin Hekmatyar announced he would support ISIS. [\u2026] Defense officials have downplayed the ISIS presence in Afghanistan, saying it mostly consists of disgruntled Taliban members rebranding themselves as ISIS. \u201cWhat\u2019s different is that people are using the ISIS name. But what we don\u2019t see is growth in their numbers,\u201d said one defense official. However, some former members of the administration \u2014 and privately, some current military officials \u2014 disagree. David Sedney, a former deputy assistant secretary of Defense for Afghanistan, Pakistan and Central Asia from 2009 to 2013, said it did not matter that ISIS was \u201crebranded\u201d Taliban. \u201cWhen they join ISIS, they make ISIS stronger. And our narrative that we\u2019re defeating it is not actually true,\u201d Sedney said in a phone interview on Monday. \u201cWe\u2019re not taking it seriously,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s more ISIS in Afghanistan today than a year ago, and a year from now it\u2019s going to be even bigger than now if we don\u2019t change our strategy.\u201d Mich\u00e8le Flournoy, former undersecretary of Defense for Policy, said in a PBS interview last month that ISIS fighters \u201care gaining ground even in Afghanistan.\u201d\n\nFor this reason, many are calling on the administration to reassess its fixation on deadlines for withdrawing troops.\n\n\u201cThe rise of the Islamic State in Afghanistan also offers one more reason to abandon the calendar-based withdrawal of U.S. forces from that country by the end of 2016,\u201d Flournoy recently wrote inThe Washington Post.\n\n\u201cInstead, the United States should adopt a more forward-looking approach that would keep a modest force in place to advise and assist the Afghan national security forces and conduct joint counterterrorism operations to safeguard both countries,\u201d she added.\n\nSen. John McCain agreed about the calendar-based withdrawal.\n\n\u201cWith the rise of [ISIS] and the distinct fighting season that is marked this year, the threat environment continues to evolve in ways that clearly, in my view, demands a reassessment of the administration\u2019s current calendar-driven drawdown of U.S. forces with a plan that must be based on conditions on the ground,\u201d he said on Saturday.\n\nAs things currently stand, however, the U.S. is set to reduce troop levels from 9,800 to an embassy presence of roughly 1,000 by the end of next year.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Not good. .05/26/2016 3:13:27AM EST.", "author": "Leah Barkoukis", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Not good.", "title": "Leah Barkoukis - The Islamic State in Iraq, Syria, and...Afghanistan", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/leahbarkoukis/2015/07/07/the-islamic-state-in-iraq-syria-andafghanistan-n2022394", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/181/2015-06-30T105655Z_2_LYNXNPEB5T0FL_RTROPTP_3_AFGHANISTAN-BLAST.JPG", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Not good.", "title": "Leah Barkoukis - The Islamic State in Iraq, Syria, and...Afghanistan", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/leahbarkoukis/2015/07/07/the-islamic-state-in-iraq-syria-andafghanistan-n2022394", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/181/2015-06-30T105655Z_2_LYNXNPEB5T0FL_RTROPTP_3_AFGHANISTAN-BLAST.JPG", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "The Islamic State in Iraq, Syria, and...Afghanistan, Leah Barkoukis, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd926\"", "article_summary": "[\u2026] Defense officials have downplayed the ISIS presence in Afghanistan, saying it mostly consists of disgruntled Taliban members rebranding themselves as ISIS.\nAs our troops have moved away from more remote areas to larger bases that are closer to big cities, the Islamic State has found an opportunity to expand into the country.\nU.S. and Afghan officials say ISIS is now in three provinces in Afghanistan, and over the weekend, Afghan warlord Gulbuddin Hekmatyar announced he would support ISIS.\nEven though the U.S. put its drawdown of troops in Afghanistan on hold this spring, that doesn\u2019t mean the changing nature of our presence in the country hasn\u2019t affected the movements of the Islamic State.\n\u201cThe rise of the Islamic State in Afghanistan also offers one more reason to abandon the calendar-based withdrawal of U.S. forces from that country by the end of 2016,\u201d Flournoy recently wrote inThe Washington Post."}
