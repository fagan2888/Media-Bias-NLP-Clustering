They generated less than 100 yards both rushing and passing. Most of the positive offense was generated by junior quarterback Benji Burchwell who had to contend with bad snaps most of the night.\n\nBurchwell completed eight passes for 36 yards and rushed for 53 yards.\n\nThe Eagles defense were able to make some stops and force the Bulldogs to settle for field goal attempts. But they also gave up big plays that put them in a deep hole early and kept them buried throughout the game.\n\nSmyrna sophomore quarterback John Turner had a big game, completing 10 passes for 194 yards with two touchdowns.\n\nTurner\u2019s first touchdown was a 10-yard strike to Deven Sims. It was the end of a five-play drive the Bulldogs orchestrated after recovering an Eagles fumble in the first quarter.\n\nSims caught another touchdown pass on the Bulldogs next drive. This time he pulled down a 58-yard bomb with one hand in tight coverage for the score.\n\nAfter kicking a 32-yard field goal, the Bulldogs ended the first half with a two-yard touchdown run by Austin Brown to make the score 24-0.\n\nAny momentum the Eagles hoped to have in the second half was quickly destroyed by Sims who returned the Eagles second half kickoff 88 yards for a touchdown.\n\nBulldog senior running back Kyle Smith rushed for 80 yards in the game including a two-yard touchdown run in the third quarter to make the score 38-0. The Bulldogs final score was a 12-yard scramble by Jontarious Turner with less than a minute remaining in the game.\n\nThe win improves the Bulldogs to 4-0. Next they will play at home against the Oakland Patriots.\n\nStill winless (0-4), the Eagles will try to end their losing streak and give their new head coach Terry Arrington his first win across town at Clarksville High Friday, September 19th.\n\nBox Score\n\n1 2 3 4 Final Northeast Eagles 0 0 0 0 0 Smyrna Bulldogs 14 10 14 6 44\n\nAbout Marlon Scott\n\nMarlon Scott is a freelance journalist and writer.
