I think it\u2019s a serious decision, not to be made lightly, but it\u2019s also not one that has to be made soon,\" Clinton said, noting she plans to work in \"whatever position I find myself in to advocate for the values and the policies I think are right for the country.\"\n\nClinton also dismissed 2016 speculation, saying she doesn't \"think it's good for the country.\"\n\n\"It\u2019s like when you meet somebody at a party and they look over your shoulder to see who else is there, and you want to talk to them about something that\u2019s really important; in fact, maybe you came to the party to talk to that particular person, and they just want to know what\u2019s next,\" Clinton said. \"I feel like that\u2019s our political process right now.

You know, just ordinary, everyday pleasures.\u201d\n\nClinton said her husband is also largely ignoring talk of her potential 2016 presidential run.\n\n\"Right now, we\u2019re trying to just have the best time we can have doin\u2019 what we\u2019re doin\u2019.\"\n\nDespite the Clintons' reluctance to seriously speculate about 2016, others are confident Clinton's the right person to represent the Democratic party in the next presidential race.\n\nOn \"State of the Union\" Sunday, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said Clinton is \"one of the best-equipped, best-prepared people to enter the White House in a very long time,\" saying she's \"more prepared\" than the last three presidents to enter the White House. On \"Meet The Press\" on Sunday, conservative pundit Bill Kristol said Clinton is \"a good candidate for Republicans to run against.\"\n\nClick here to read more from New York Magazine.\n\nAlso on HuffPost: Hillary And Bill Through The Years Hillary And Bill Through The Years\n\n1 of 21 Their wedding day on October 11, 1975 Share this slide:\n\nFacebook", "article_metadata": {"description": "Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton opened up to ...", "sailthru.expire_date": "2013-09-23 09:59:14 -0400", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton opened up to ...", "title": "Clinton: 'I'm Both Pragmatic And Realistic' About Running For President", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/22/hillary-clinton-president_n_3971576.html", "image": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1366644/images/o-HILLARY-CLINTON-facebook.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton opened up to ...", "creator": "paigelav", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1366644/images/o-HILLARY-CLINTON-facebook.jpg", "height": 1000}, "title": "Clinton: 'I'm Both Pragmatic And Realistic' About Running For President", "site": "@HuffPostPol", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-09-22 09:59:14 -0400", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=3971576", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "Bill Clinton,hillary-clinton,clinton 2016,hillary clinton ny mag interview,hillary clinton presidential run,hillary clinton interview,Hillary Clinton President,hillary clinton 2016,Hillary Clinton Bill Clinton,Bill Clinton Hillary Clinton", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "Bill Clinton,hillary-clinton,clinton 2016,hillary clinton ny mag interview,hillary clinton presidential run,hillary clinton interview,Hillary Clinton President,hillary clinton 2016,Hillary Clinton Bill Clinton,Bill Clinton Hillary Clinton", "published_time": "2013-09-22 09:59:14 -0400", "modified_time": "2013-09-23 17:12:53 -0400"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbb8a\"", "article_summary": "I just don\u2019t think it is good.\u201dClinton said she's currently enjoying more quality time with her husband, former President Bill Clinton.\nFormer Secretary of State Hillary Clinton opened up to New York Magazine about a potential presidential run, saying she's both \"pragmatic and realistic\" about aiming for the nation's top office.\nYou know, just ordinary, everyday pleasures.\u201dClinton said her husband is also largely ignoring talk of her potential 2016 presidential run.\nClinton also dismissed 2016 speculation, saying she doesn't \"think it's good for the country.\"\nOn \"Meet The Press\" on Sunday, conservative pundit Bill Kristol said Clinton is \"a good candidate for Republicans to run against.\""}
