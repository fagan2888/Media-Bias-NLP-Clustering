While the agents themselves are not physically in the vehicles, the Progressive \u201cSnapshot\u201d device -- which functions much like a car\u2019s Event Data Recorder, or \u201cEDR\u201d (also known as a \u201cblack box\u201d) -- constantly monitors and records every move a driver makes; including how often drivers slam on the brakes, how many miles they drive, and how much time they spend driving at high-risk hours (Midnight to 4:00 AM). Progressive claims collecting such data will save money for \u201csafe-drivers,\u201d but in actuality it is simply a way for the company to easily identify risky drivers -- all from voluntary participation!\n\nThe notion that drivers \u201cvoluntarily\u201d reveal their driving habits is more myth than fact in today\u2019s internet-wired world. The reality is that American drivers have little clue as to what data is being collected on them, who is able to access the data, and how it is eventually used.\n\nAutomakers are a tight-lipped bunch when the discussion turns to the data collected by the products they manufacture. However, in a rare example of frankness on the subject, Ford Motor Company Global Vice President of Marketing and Sales, Jim Farley, put it bluntly during a recent trade show panel: \u201cWe know everyone who breaks the law, we know when you're doing it . . . We have GPS in your car, so we know what you're doing.\u201d\n\nNot surprisingly, Farley\u2019s boardroom bosses at corporate headquarters immediately dismissed his comments, claiming the company \u201cis absolutely committed to protecting [their] customers\u2019 privacy.\u201d The corporate big wigs stressed Ford does not \u201ctrack\u201d customers, and that \u201cno data is transmitted from the vehicle without the customer\u2019s express consent.\u201d Such assurances ring hollow. In fact, the very words used by Ford to diffuse Farley\u2019s comments actually confirmed that vehicle owners neither really know nor control the data collected by their vehicles\u2019 black boxes.\n\nMoreover, a recently-released report from the Government Accountability Office (GAO) sheds much-needed light on this developing controversy. The report, commissioned by Sen. Al Franken of Minnesota, notes that massive quantities of data are being captured and shared by the vehicles we operate, and that consumers have virtually no knowledge or control of the process.\n\nA New York Times article on consumer privacy detailed technology available in the new Chevrolet Corvette. The story highlighted the whiz-bang technology that can visually record the driver\u2019s point-of-view, in addition to recording noises or conversations taking place inside the car. Chevy claims this information, recorded digitally by a device inside the glove box, belongs to the consumer -- ostensibly designed to improve a driver\u2019s performance driving.\n\nAs for transparency, the fact is that most vehicle data collection techniques are mentioned only in passing by manufacturers somewhere in the owner\u2019s manual (if at all). Most consumers become aware this type of information has been or is being collected on them only when it appears as evidence in a civil or criminal proceeding against them.\n\n\u201cThe privacy and liability issues associated with the [data recorders] are as real as with any archived data that can be used by or against individuals,\u201d William Kohler, co-chair of law firm Clark Hill\u2019s Automotive and Manufacturing Practice Group, told the New York Times.\n\nCorporations are able to gather such troves of data largely because they are not bound by the same constitutionally-imposed limits on searches and seizures that limit government collection of information -- or which are supposed to limit government. Making the problem worse has been the unwillingness of the Congress in recent years to enact meaningful safeguards for the privacy of vehicle owners and drivers.\n\nUnder current law, there is little to stop corporations from turning over consumer information gleaned from vehicle black boxes to government agencies. In essence, the government can use third-parties corporations, like Ford, TomTom or Progressive, to collect vehicle data without restraint, then ask for or demand the data it wants. There does not have to be an imminent need for the data (you know, just in case) -- a key requirement for constitutionally-valid searches under the 4th Amendment.\n\nThankfully, consumer backlash against Verizon, Google, and other tech companies for their cooperation with NSA\u2019s now publicly-known electronic snooping, suggests the public does have a threshold for how cozy private companies should be allowed to get with Uncle Sam. It remains to be seen, however, whether they actually will demand action to protect against the dangers posed their basic freedom, by such unfettered collection of data about what they do when they get behind the wheel of their car or pick-up truck.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Progressive Insurance wants its insurance agents to take a 30-day ride-along with its customers..05/26/2016 1:50:56AM EST.", "author": "Bob Barr", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Progressive Insurance wants its insurance agents to take a 30-day ride-along with its customers.", "title": "- U.S. Automakers and the NSA \u2013 Peas in a Pod", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/bobbarr/2014/01/15/us-automakers-and-the-nsa--peas-in-a-pod-n1779390", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/15/2014-01-15T110727Z_1_CBREA0E0UWJ00_RTROPTP_3_AUTOSHOW-FRANKFURT.JPG", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Progressive Insurance wants its insurance agents to take a 30-day ride-along with its customers.", "title": "- U.S. Automakers and the NSA \u2013 Peas in a Pod", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/bobbarr/2014/01/15/us-automakers-and-the-nsa--peas-in-a-pod-n1779390", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/15/2014-01-15T110727Z_1_CBREA0E0UWJ00_RTROPTP_3_AUTOSHOW-FRANKFURT.JPG", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "U.S. Automakers and the NSA \u2013 Peas in a Pod, Bob Barr, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2a7d\"", "article_summary": "A New York Times article on consumer privacy detailed technology available in the new Chevrolet Corvette.\nAs for transparency, the fact is that most vehicle data collection techniques are mentioned only in passing by manufacturers somewhere in the owner\u2019s manual (if at all).\nUnder current law, there is little to stop corporations from turning over consumer information gleaned from vehicle black boxes to government agencies.\nAutomakers are a tight-lipped bunch when the discussion turns to the data collected by the products they manufacture.\nIn essence, the government can use third-parties corporations, like Ford, TomTom or Progressive, to collect vehicle data without restraint, then ask for or demand the data it wants."}
