Paige broke the news to Emily that her parents are moving to California for good. Hanna was sad that Mona was not there to celebrate the holiday with the group. Alison, left out of the group, watched them through a window. Just as they attempted to have their holiday feast, they all heard a noise and ran outside to see what it was.
