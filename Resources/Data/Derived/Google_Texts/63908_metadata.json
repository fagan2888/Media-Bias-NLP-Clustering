Bill Walker\u2019s decision late last week to unilaterally accept federal funds available to cover low-income people under the Affordable Care Act, three-fifths of all the states have now accepted expanded Medicaid benefits for their residents.\n\nThree years after the Supreme Court limited the expansion of Medicaid under President Obama\u2019s health care reform law, the federal-state health program for the poor and disabled has evolved into a troubling dual system in which the availability of health care is being determined largely by the continued partisan divide over Obamacare and the geographic accident of where poor people happen to live.\n\nRelated: Soaring Medicaid Enrollment Could Hit State Budgets\n\nOnce they were free to decide for themselves whether to go along with expanding Medicaid coverage, 30 states and the District of Columbia ultimately agreed to the coverage. But the 20 remaining states \u2014 many of them dominated by Republican state legislatures or statehouses \u2014 have either rejected the offer or are leaning against it. The result is that poor people living in Arkansas, for example, can qualify for expanded Medicaid coverage, while people in equally dire financial straits living in the adjoining states of Oklahoma, Missouri, Tennessee and Mississippi cannot.\n\nThe ACA expands Medicaid coverage for most adults with income up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level. More than 15 million men, women and children have become eligible for Medicaid in states that participate in the expansion, according to the White House. Roughly 5 million others are being denied coverage because of decisions by their states to reject the offer.\n\nAlaska\u2019s Walker, an independent who took office last December, told reporters in Anchorage on Thursday that he could not wait any longer to offer health coverage to approximately 42,000 people his administration projects will be eligible under the expansion. The governor acted on his own after failing to persuade his legislature to go along with the program, although he hopes the state\u2019s Legislative Budget and Audit Committee concurs within 45 days.\n\nFor states that agree to extend health care coverage to low income people who for a variety of reasons haven\u2019t qualified for Medicaid until now, the federal government will cover the full cost through 2016 and then gradually lower its share to 90 percent by 2020. State officials estimate Alaska would draw $1.1 billion in additional federal funds over the next six years.\n\nWhile most governors or their legislatures concluded this was a good deal for their states \u2014 including Republican chief executives in Ohio and Kentucky \u2014 others rejected it either because they oppose Obamacare or because they fear the federal government will eventually leave them holding the bag for the entire cost of the expanded coverage.\n\nAmericans for Prosperity, a conservative advocacy group financed by the billionaire Koch brothers, waged an aggressive campaign in Alaska against the expansion, warning residents that it posed a long-term financial threat to the state.\n\n\u201cAt a time when the state is facing a $4 billion deficit, we think it's a bad idea to add 40,000 people to the program,\u201d AFP Alaska State Director Jeremy Price said, according to media reports.\n\nHowever, Patrick Willard, Families USA\u2019s Health Action Director, hailed Walker\u2019s decision and said that the focus now shifts to Utah, where Republican Gov. Gary Herbert and legislative leaders just agreed on the framework for expanding Medicaid coverage in the state.\n\nRelated: States of Health: Winners & Losers in Medicaid\n\n\u201cWe know that expanding health care access is bringing down the uninsured rates and helping states achieve budget savings,\u201d Willard said in a statement. \u201cThe bad news is that too many states with lots of uninsured are holding out for political reasons.\u201d\n\nHere is a map showing the great divide between states with and without expanded Medicaid coverage:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "With Alaska Gov.", "title": "The Great State Divide Over Expanded Medicaid", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/07/19/Great-State-Divide-Over-Expanded-Medicaid", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02262013_medicaid_expand_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/07/19/Great-State-Divide-Over-Expanded-Medicaid", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02262013_medicaid_expand_article.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "With Alaska Gov.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0e27\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe bad news is that too many states with lots of uninsured are holding out for political reasons.\u201dHere is a map showing the great divide between states with and without expanded Medicaid coverage:\nGary Herbert and legislative leaders just agreed on the framework for expanding Medicaid coverage in the state.\nRelated: Soaring Medicaid Enrollment Could Hit State BudgetsOnce they were free to decide for themselves whether to go along with expanding Medicaid coverage, 30 states and the District of Columbia ultimately agreed to the coverage.\nThe ACA expands Medicaid coverage for most adults with income up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level.\n\u201cAt a time when the state is facing a $4 billion deficit, we think it's a bad idea to add 40,000 people to the program,\u201d AFP Alaska State Director Jeremy Price said, according to media reports."}
