These measures are transparent and primarily preventive in nature,\" it said.\n\nUkrainian President Viktor Yanukovich has warned of rising radicalism and terrorist activities after more than two months of civil unrest in which anti-government protesters have occupied buildings in the capital Kiev and other cities, calling for political reform and Yanukovich's resignation.\n\nA Ukrainian man tried to hijack a passenger plane from Ukraine to Turkey on Friday, making a bomb threat and demanding to go to the Winter Olympics venue of Sochi, Russia, just as the opening ceremony was taking place. He was later arrested by Turkish security forces.\n\n(Reporting by Jack Stubbs; Editing by Richard Balmforth and Kevin Liffey)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Reuters Editorial", "Author": "Reuters Editorial", "DCSext.PageNumber": 1, "twitter": {"description": "Ukraine's state security service on Sunday placed anti-terrorist units on alert in response to a sharp rise in unspecified threats against sensitive installations including atomic power stations, airports and gas and oil pipelines.", "title": "Ukraine places anti-terrorist forces on alert", "image": "http://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20140209&t=2&i=836727438&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=CBREA1815NQ00", "creator": "@Reuters", "site": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "DCSext.rChannel": "Article -
