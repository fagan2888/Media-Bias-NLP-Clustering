The BattleFrog Fiesta Bowl will pit Notre Dame against Ohio State at University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale on Friday, Jan. 1.

The matchup was determined by the 13-member College Football Playoff Selection Committee.

It was announced Sunday at the Arizona Office of Tourism Fiesta Bowl Selectionfest in Scottsdale.

The defending champion Buckeyes (11-1) lost their only game to Michigan State and needed help to get into college football's final four. They didn't get it and wind up No. 7 in the final CFP ranking.



Notre Dame (10-2) fought through a slew of injuries to finish four points shy of a perfect record. The Fighting Irish are No. 8 in the final rankings.

On Friday, the Fiesta Bowl got a new title sponsor, a company that organizes fitness events and obstacle races.

"BattleFrog's commitment to creating unique and exciting events matches our desire to deliver one-of-a-kind experiences to fans each year," Fiesta Bowl Executive Director Mike Nealy said in a news release.

BattleFrog also is the title sponsor of the pregame party -- the BattleFrog Fiesta Bowl Fan Fest.

Tickets to the BattleFrog Fiesta Bowl and the BattleFrog Fiesta Bowl Fan Fest Pregame Party are available for purchase by calling 480-350-0900 or visiting FiestaBowl.org.

The National Bank of Arizona Fiesta Bowl Parade is Saturday, Jan. 2 in Downtown Phoenix. It will be broadcast live on 3TV and streamed on azfamily.com

Last month, Nealy announced Motel 6 as the title sponsor of the 2016 Cactus Bowl, which also is hosted by the Fiesta Bowl organization. That game will be played at Chase Field on Saturday, Jan. 2. Featuring teams from the Big 12 and Pac 12, the game will be carried on ESPN.
