He said he knew he was a boy from a very young age and not his assigned birth sex of female. His mom took it hard. She cried a lot and was in denial, he said.\n\nHe remembers a shopping trip where he asked his mom for a suit and tie.\n\n\u201cShe said, \u2018You\u2019ll never be a boy, so stop asking me these things,\u2019\u201d Jack recounted.\n\nJordan took part in a transgender youth panel during TransCon, a daylong conference at Barry University in Miami Shores that covered a wide range of transgender issues.\n\nAt this workshop, Jordan and other transgender youth talked about their struggles, successes and dreams.\n\nZachariah Sloane was one of the youth panelists last year. This year, he was the moderator coaxing the conversation along.\n\n\u201cThe statistics for trans youth are pretty bad. Studies show that at least one-third of transgender youth attempt or will attempt suicide,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the panel of six transgender people all under the age of 21, every one of them said they either contemplated or attempted to commit suicide.\n\nAnd in most cases, they said, their parents didn\u2019t fully accept their gender identity until their parents realized they were at risk of losing them.\n\n\u201cThere would be times where I would be like this close to hanging in my closet,\u201d said Jordan.\n\nHe found support at The Yes Institute in Miami and told his mom. The organization helps families understand gender identity and provides counseling to them.\n\nJack said after counseling and interacting with other parents of transgender children, his mom came around.\n\n\u201cMy mom is now my number one supporter,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s there for me for anything, and I love her a lot.\u201d\n\nAdolescence can be incredibly difficult for anyone. That\u2019s especially true for transgender youth who face bullying a lot more often.\n\nBut when several of the panelists spoke at the workshop about being bullied, it wasn\u2019t by their peers. They said the bullies were the adults at their schools.\n\n\u201cI had my math teacher, in front of 30 of my peers, call me \u2018it\u2019 in the middle of class and was like, \u2018Oh, you should get used to this type of treatment,\u2019\u201d said Leo, who declined to provide his last name because he didn\u2019t want to face retaliation at school.\n\nLeo came out as a transgender male just as he was entering the ninth grade.\n\nAnother teenager, Victor Lopez, said he also had to deal with teachers who didn\u2019t understand or didn\u2019t want to understand him.\n\nHe said one of his teachers called his mom to complain about his transition.\n\n\u201cThis specific teacher was like, \u2018What\u2019s wrong with your child? I don\u2019t want these kids to be confused,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cAnd she doesn\u2019t respect my preferred name.\u201d\n\nHis teacher calls him by his last name.\n\nThe workshop\u2019s moderator, Sloane, said giving trans youth a voice doesn\u2019t just give them more confidence, it can also change the way society sees transgender people.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s definitely a change coming through,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can look at all the online communities and everything, and the youth are building up to make a change in the trans community.\u201d\n\nThat change, the panelists agree, will come with more activism around trans rights and issues. It\u2019ll also come with more mainstream and nuanced representations of transgender people in the workplace and in everyday life.\n\nXzanakya, a 20-year old transgender woman on the panel, said there aren\u2019t enough transgender people in government and mainstream jobs, which she added is vital for transgender issues to gain traction\n\n\u201cI want to study political science and Japanese at the same time,\" she said. \u201cI want to be a politician.\u201d\n\nNot just any politician. Xzanakya wants to the first transgender U.S. president.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "none", "description": "Listen \n        Listening...", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://health.wusf.usf.edu/post/miami-transgender-youth-discuss-family-life-bullying-and-inclusion", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/shared/npr/styles/medium/nprshared/201503/394800238.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Listen \n        Listening...", "title": "Miami Transgender Youth Discuss Family Life, Bullying And Inclusion"}, "story_id": 393952853, "twitter": {"site": "@HealthNewsFL", "card": "summary", "creator": "@HealthNewsFL"}, "author": "Nadege Green", "org_id": 482, "dc": {"title": "Miami Transgender Youth Discuss Family Life, Bullying And Inclusion"}, "nid": 9976, "datePublished": "2015-03-19", "wordCount": 936, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd23ae\"", "article_summary": "Jordan took part in a transgender youth panel during TransCon, a daylong conference at Barry University in Miami Shores that covered a wide range of transgender issues.\nAnother teenager, Victor Lopez, said he also had to deal with teachers who didn\u2019t understand or didn\u2019t want to understand him.\nThat\u2019s especially true for transgender youth who face bullying a lot more often.\nAt this workshop, Jordan and other transgender youth talked about their struggles, successes and dreams.\nStudies show that at least one-third of transgender youth attempt or will attempt suicide,\u201d he said."}
