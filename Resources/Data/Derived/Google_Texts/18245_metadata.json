Yes. Reversal would have been the first case of a state reversing an ACA expansion, and would have emboldened opponents to seek similar reversals in other states.\n\nThe ACA, as originally designed, required that all states expand their Medicaid programs by 1/1/2014 to all uninsured residents with incomes below 138% of the federal poverty line (about $15K in annual income for a single adult). The U.S. Supreme Court decision in June 2012 that upheld the ACA's constitutionality also required that the Medicaid expansion be optional for states.\n\nIn Arkansas, with a Democratic Governor (Mike Beebe) and a Republican-controlled House and Senate, a traditional ACA-Medicaid expansion was not in the cards. Despite the accusation that the ACA requires a \"one size fits all\" approach, the Obama Administration agreed to permit otherwise-Medicaid eligible adults to instead receive fully subsidized private health insurance through the state exchange/marketplace -- all private insurance all the time. Since the deal was struck in 2013, Iowa made a similar agreement, and other states such as Pennsylvania and Utah are now negotiating their own alternatives.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"Keywords": "health coverage, health issues, healthcare reform, obama care, hmo, health care bill, health savings account, health care legislation, health care in the us, affordable care act, health care coverage, costs of health care, health care costs, obama health care, health care problems, health insurance costs, health care reform bill, health policies, health care policy, health care laws, health care regulations, health care politics", "og": {"type": "article", "image": "http://cache.boston.com/community/blogs/images/health_stew/mug_170x161.png", "site_name": "Boston.com", "description": "The ACA-Medicaid expansion holds in Arkansas and will hold everywhere else as more and more red-leaning states find ways to join.
