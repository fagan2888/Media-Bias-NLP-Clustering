The dudes of Full House are selling Greek yogurt. Boyz II Men recently made a cameo on How I Met Your Mother. This year's Super Bowl featured, of all people, Flea. We are having a moment of '90s nostalgia, occasioned in part by millennials (or The Youths or Those Kids or whatever you want to call them) who are aging into adulthood and therefore eager to relive their childhoods. Which leads to, among other things, Ice coming back\u2014yet again\u2014with a brand new invention. And he's in good company, too. The boxed dinner the returned rapper would like you to buy? It features noodles that are shaped like the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. *** Nostalgia, the copious literature on it suggests, comes in two basic forms. One is organic, the kind that washes over you when you see an old picture of yourself and your cousins, aged 7 and 9 and 10, giggling maniacally while innertubing on Lake Michigan. The kind that emergences unexpectedly, as a kind of pleasant pang\u2014the stuff of sudden songs and serendipitous scents and sour-sweet Madeleines.\n\nThe other form\u2014the form that may well feel most familiar to us at this point\u2014is a media product. It's the re-introduction of Uncle Joey and/or Dawson\u2019s Creek's Joey and/or Blossom's Joey, appropriated to arouse a vague sense that we have lost something as we\u2019ve moved, inexorably, into our future. This form of nostalgia is usually invoked, in one way or another, to sell us stuff. You could, because of that, dismiss its validity (fauxstalgia?). But it will live on, inevitably, because media producers know exactly what advertisers have long understood: that nostalgia, like sex, sells. The products of that basic insight, whether they're movies or TV shows or weird appearances on terrible CBS sitcoms, tend to permeate the culture miasmically, their shiftings shaped by Hollywood and Wieden + Kennedy and the producers of Super Bowl Halftime Shows. And they can be good. They can be, sometimes, great! Take The Lego Movie (pardon me, The LEGO\u00ae Movie). And also: Mad Men and Boardwalk Empire and Masters of Sex and any theater that has ever offered a midnight showing of The Big Lebowski. Nostalgia, under the stewardship of the Internet, has been made nimble. As market goods, however, these products can also be recursive: Mad Men begat not only Banana Republic\u2019s \u201960s-inspired clothing line, but also books like Mad Women: The Other Side of Life on Madison Avenue in the '60s and Beyond. Baz Luhrmann\u2019s remake of The Great Gatsby wasn\u2019t merely a movie; it was also an album (a Target exclusive of which features three bonus tracks!) and a line of Brooks Brothers clothing and a collection of Tiffany jewelry. While, sure, commercial culture is commercial, it\u2019s also notable how ambient nostalgia has become. The memorial-industrial complex ensures that our past\u2014our collective past\u2014permeates our present. That complex markets directly to memories that are shared, across generations and across demographics and across the culture. And the complex is extending, now, to the Internet. *** Donovan Sung manages discovery and recommendations at Spotify, the streaming music service that, as of the end of last year, claims 24 million active users and 4.5 billion hours\u2019 worth of song streams. Sung spends a lot of his time thinking about how to engage users and encourage their loyalty through the particular medium of music\u2014about how to make those billions of hours, essentially, time that users will consider well spent. One of those ways is through what Spotify calls \u201cstories\u201d: little advertisements that live within the app and surface song recommendations to users.\n\nThe stories vary in their messaging. Some are about making lateral connections between different songs and artists (\u201cYou listened to Otis Redding this week. Want to try James Brown?\u201d). Some are about connecting users to their geographic settings (\u201cThis album by Foster the People is trending near you\u201d). Some are about connecting users to songs whose rhythm or moods they might find appealing (\u201cYou listened to Neutral Milk Hotel this week. Want to try Sea Wolf?\u201d). But some of Spotify\u2019s most effective stories, Sung told me, take a slightly different tack: They present songs based not on your activity within Spotify, but on your activity outside of it. Activity that occurred long before Spotify was a gleam in Daniel Ek's eye. So some of the stories you\u2019ll see on Spotify look like this: And like this: These recommendations vary according to a user\u2019s birth date, which is one of the pieces of information Spotify gathers from its new members when they first sign up for the service. (Gender is another one.) Spotify uses those data points, in part, to read users\u2019 pasts back to them, offering up a fairly faithful (re-)rendition of the popular musical landscape as it existed when they were younger. In all this, to be clear, Spotify isn\u2019t necessarily surfacing the songs you were listening to when you were in high school. (Its data-tracking notwithstanding, how could it possibly know about the Fiona Apple phase you went through sophomore year?) What it\u2019s doing, instead, is surfacing the songs that were popular across the culture when you were in junior or high school. The service is making the fair assumption that there will indeed be some overlap between your own musical past and the collective. And that, whether or not you care to admit it today, hearing \u201cHit Me, Baby, One More Time\u201d again will take you right back to a particular moment in your life\u2014that time you danced to it. That time you heard it on the radio as you were driving back from soccer practice. That time you tried, and totally failed, to unhear it.\n\nThe point of all this past-leveraging, from Spotify\u2019s perspective, is to realize the vague-but-also-urgent goal shared by many social networks and services: user engagement. \"For almost everyone,\u201d Sung says, a nostalgia-focused Spotify story \u201cusually triggers some sort of strong emotion. Sometimes it's, 'Wow, I totally forgot that song. Thanks so much for reminding me of it.' Other times, it's more like, 'Yeah, I remember music was pretty bad when I was young.\u2019\u201d (Case in point? \"One of the stories I got was 'Britney Spears was big when you were young,\u2019\u201d Sung says. \u201cAnd I was like, 'Yeah, I totally remember that, and I don't need to remember it again.\u2019\u201d) Either way, though: engagement. And an experience of the past that is customized\u2014if not to a person, individually, then to that person's generational demographic. Spotify\u2019s interpretation of nostalgia, in that sense, is pretty much the opposite of The LEGO\u00ae Movie\u2019s or Mad Men's or that of Kraft-by-way-of-the-Ninja Turtles-by-way-of-Vanilla Ice. It's not aimed at a broad public. It\u2019s not enforced at the level of the mass culture. Instead, it\u2019s aimed directly at the user. It\u2019s a targeted ad, essentially\u2014and the thing being advertised is a person\u2019s own past. *** Spotify isn\u2019t alone in its use of nostalgia as a marketing tool. Social networks in general, you could argue, are implicitly\u2014preemptively\u2014nostalgic, combining our pasts and our presences into a unified experience. Networks, however, are also experimenting with more explicit forms of nostalgia-baiting. Earlier this month, Facebook rolled out \u201cLook Back\u201d compilations that collect users\u2019 most-liked photos, statuses, and life events into an easily viewable video. (These collections come in addition to the old standby, the network\u2019s \u201cYear in Review\u201d feature.) Instagram, of course, lets you present your self-shot digital images through the filters of analog cameras\u2014a feature that users sometimes employ to participate in \"throwback Thursday.\" And also! An app called Timehop promises to show you \u201cphotos and updates from this exact day in history.\u201d Google Plus, as a default feature of its profile page, creates a personalized map highlighting the geographical locations a user has called home\u2014an individualized bildungsroman, as told through markers. Google itself allows users to export their web histories\u2014which double as page-by-page retrackings, essentially, of lives as lived on the Internet\u2014for both archiving and analysis. Twitter, similarly, lets you download a complete archive of your tweet history\u2014under the logic that, as Twitter engineer Mollie Vandor explained, \u201cWe know lots of you would like to explore your Twitter past.\u201d\n\nEven Pinterest, which is most commonly associated with future-oriented and aspirational image-collecting, makes use of customized nostalgia. Gabriel Trionfi, Pinterest's user experience researcher, is a psychologist by training, and he points out that the flip side of anticipation\u2014one of the emotions Pinterest uses to generation its own version of user engagement\u2014is, yep, nostalgia. Journalists have long recognized the same thing advertisers have, which is that nostalgia is an extremely efficient tool for selling stuff. \u201cNostalgia is a known way to boost people's mood,\u201d Trionfi told me. It allows people to live (and re-live) \u201csomething familiar, something they remember, a positive emotional experience.\u201d On Pinterest, he points out, if you do a search for something like \"80s kid\" or \"90s toys\" or \"80s cartoon,\" you'll be greeted with a wide of assortment of boards that celebrate users' youths. So people are using Pinterest\u2019s future-oriented platform, Trionfi says, to re-collect images from their past. Nostalgia, at its most basic level, requires access to memories\u2014and there is, of course, no better archive than the Internet. The social networks that are becoming increasingly synonymous with our experience of that Internet are attempting to use that fact for their own gain. \u201cI think you see people seeking out and collecting these things,\u201d Trionfi notes, for one simple reason: \u201cBecause it makes them feel good.\" The good feeling is growing. Many media outlets (\"content producers,\" you could call them) are selling nostalgia in one form or another: There\u2019s Retronaut and @historyinpix and the many similar\u2014and controversial\u2014features dedicated to the resurfacing of the past. There\u2019s New York magazine\u2019s late, great \u201cNostalgia Face-Check\u201d series. Yesterday, Wired\u2014known mostly for its reporting on the future\u2014published a list, curated by Questlove, of the top hip-hop tracks of the \u201990s. (Questlove's collection includes something from Tony! Toni! Ton\u00e9!, and is therefore awesome.) This is all fairly unremarkable; journalists have long recognized the same thing advertisers have, which is that nostalgia is an extremely efficient tool for selling stuff. But media outlets\u2014especially the ones that are merging technological prowess with journalistic\u2014aren\u2019t just leveraging our soft enthusiasms for the past; they\u2019re also taking a platform-focused approach to that work. They, like the social networks, are trafficking in targeted nostalgia.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Long-lost memories pop up in music recommendations, personality quizzes, and ads.
