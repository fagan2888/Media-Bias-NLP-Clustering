Rain may have been falling on everyone in Liberty State Park yesterday, but the wet weather didn't stop the arrival of some very special guests.

The Budweiser Clydesdales made their way to the park yesterday to the delight of visitors.

"They're amazing," said Brittny Corrigan, 28, one of 8 Clydesdale handlers who travel with the 10 horses. "They are very calm and gentle. They all have their own personalities."

The horses travel in custom made semi-tractor trailers to each event, which Corrigan and her fellow handlers drive themselves. According to Corrigan, the Clydesdales make three to five appearances a week, and they travel 320 days out of the year. Only eight of the 10 horses are needed to pull the iconic Budweiser wagon, so the handlers can rotate which horses appear and give some needed time off to each horse.

"You typically just see looks of awe," Corrigan said about people seeing the Clydesdales for the first time. "They just stare at the horses."

Chris and Carol Hill, of Chester, made a stop in the Clydesdale tent yesterday as part of their day in the park.

"It was worth the trip here just to see the Clydesdales," said Carol, 50.

"They look so big it's almost hard to believe," said Chris, 51.
