There are likely many reasons for this \u2014 partially owing to voter participation, partially owing to differences in education and very likely owing to the influence of money over politics. However, one other important factor that generally goes under the radar is legislative professionalism.\n\nA professionalize d legislature differs from a citizen legislature in several ways: Professional legislatures generally meet for a more extended period of time and are paid enough that they do not have other careers. Professional legislators have larger staffs, more money to research policy and more time to deliberate and hold hearings. Professionalize d legislatures also tend to attract politicians interested in working their way to higher levels of government.\n\n\n\nIn a recent segment, John Oliver addressed the absurdity of state legislatures \u2014 and the concerns about professionalism he raises are important. As I\u2019ve noted elsewhere, income inequality is shaped enormously at the state level. This influence has only increased in recent years, as the federal government has become more gridlocked. In a new study, Elizabeth Rigby and Megan Hatch estimate that If states had adopted more liberal policies, the increase in inequality (as measured by the Gini Coefficient) would have been 60 percent smaller \u2014 and the share going to the top 1 percent would have been halved. Inequality at the state level also has implications for representation; Patrick Flavin finds that inequality of income is one of the most important predictors of inequality of representation. New evidence suggests that differences in legislature structure at the state level have important implications for representation.\n\nIn an influential study, Jeffrey Lax and Justin Phillips examined 39 policies in eight broad issue areas. They calculated the congruence of public opinion and government policy for each issue. Congruence is a measure of how responsive policymakers are to public opinion: a low congruence indicates that legislators aren\u2019t very responsive, a high congruence indicates they are. Congruence ranges from a low of 6 percent on bilingual education to a high of 86 percent on legalizing state lotteries. The researchers also found that while state governments are \u201cgenerally responsive\u201d to public opinion, they also \u201ceffectively translate majority opinion into policy only about half the time. [\u2026] This is true even when majority are large and when salience is high.\u201d\n\nHow can legislatures be made more responsive? The authors found, \u201cA one standard deviation increase in professionalization increases the marginal effect of opinion by about 28 percent.\u201d In addition, interest groups can work against the public interest, in the case that a strong interest group is opposed to a policy, the size of the majority in favor of the policy would have to be nine percentage points higher than otherwise. The opposite holds true: If an interest group favors a policy that the majority does, it will be more likely to pass. However, the work of Benjamin Page and Martin Gilens suggests that mass-based interest groups have only modest correlation with the views of most Americans and business interest groups have a negative correlation with the views of Americans, so it\u2019s more likely that interest groups will be working against the democratic will.", "article_metadata": {"description": "There are many reasons for our broken system.
