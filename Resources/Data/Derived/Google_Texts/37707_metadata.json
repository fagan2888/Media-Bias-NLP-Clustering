Charlie Crist respects and trusts Florida women and as governor he\u2019ll fight for them \u2013 and we know he will, because he\u2019s done it before.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Democratic Candidate for Lieutenant Governor Annette Taddeo\n\nJUST THE STATS 26 percent The margin of victory for Democratic President Barack Obama over Republican Mitt Romney among unmarried Florida women voters in 2012 70 percent Percentage of progressive base \u201cdrop-off voters\u201d \u2013 voters who don\u2019t participate in midterm elections \u2013 who were \u201cvery motivated\u201d by the prospect of voting against anti-choice candidates $1.5 million Amount Gov. Rick Scott vetoed for funding 30 rape crisis centers in 2012 (during Sexual Assault Awareness Month)\n\nGirl panic\n\nWhile much of the country spent a few silent moments last week remembering a September Tuesday that would go on to launch a war with Iraq \u2013 and a few more moments grousing about whether President Barack Obama was about to launch another war, this time on the strange blob of anger called ISIS \u2013 the Charlie Crist campaign was invoking a different war altogether. Remember that time back in 2010 when Crist vetoed the mandatory ultrasound bill that applied to all abortions (except those involving rape, incest or human trafficking)? You do now. That \u201cwar on women\u201d thing isn\u2019t going anywhere, Republicans.\n\nOn Sept. 9, Crist rolled out his \u201cExtreme\u201d ad buy \u2013 currently saturating a flat-screen near you with cold stares and animus \u2013 in which a number of women soberly list their concerns with a governor and a party that have made money and votes out of that rancid thin air called misogynistic entitlement. \u201cWhen it comes to doing what\u2019s right for Florida women, Rick Scott has been wrong every single time,\u201d says the last woman in the commercial. And it\u2019s really hard to argue on that point. Scott did, after all, sign said ultrasound bill the year after Crist vetoed it; he defunded rape crisis centers; he fought the birth control mandate written into the Affordable Care Act; he scared everybody so much that nobody even has sex anymore because \u2026 ugly. Rick Scott, says every breeze blowing throughout Florida, is not very kind to women, politically speaking. And he\u2019s not really shying away from that either.\n\nWhile all of this hell-hath-no-fury bluster was pumping out of the Crist corner, Scott was campaigning with lovebucket New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and U.S. Rep. Steve Southerland, R-Panama City, as if nothing unladylike were going on. Somewhat hilariously, Southerland sort of personifies the latest Democratic ladyparts offensive. He\u2019s been catching (national) hell for an invitation to a men-only, not-at-all-gay fundraiser back in March that included this little bit of sexist syntax: \u201cTell the Misses not to wait up because the after dinner whiskey and cigars will be smooth & the issues to discuss are many.\u201d Yikes!\n\nConfronted by the Tampa Bay Times on the trail about that and the fact that he\u2019s running against a woman, Democrat Gwen Graham (daughter of Sen. Bob Graham), Southerland dug his own manhole a little bit deeper:\n\n\u201cAsked to respond to the Democrats\u2019 criticism that he\u2019s anti-women, Southerland laughed and said: \u2018I live with five women. That\u2019s all I\u2019m saying. I live with five women. Listen: Has Gwen Graham ever been to a lingerie shower? Ask her. And how many men were there?\u2019\u201d the paper reported. Yep, that happened.\n\nSo it would only make sense that Crist \u2013 who is in a dead heat with Scott in the polls for reasons far too broad to go into here; i.e., people are dumb sometimes \u2013 would seize on the opportunity to remind Florida\u2019s female population that, even as a former Republican, he\u2019s generally not one to be a dick on women\u2019s issues.\n\nTo help convey this message (especially over the fray of robocalls that Republicans have been issuing in which Crist is heard saying he\u2019s \u201cpro-life\u201d because that\u2019s what Republicans did when he was a Republican), Crist enlisted his Lieutenant Governor running mate Annette Taddeo \u2013 along with Planned Parenthood PAC treasurer Barbara Zdravecky \u2013 to host a press call on Sept. 9 announcing the new ad campaign and taking the predictable questions about flip-flops in the summer. The dynamic duo were quick to make sure that questions about Crist focus on what\u2019s right here and what\u2019s right now. Planned Parenthood issued specific questions to candidates before endorsing them \u2013 it has endorsed Crist formally \u2013 and Charlie was the right guy in this very moment.\n\n\u201cRight now Charlie is really clear on all of our issues,\u201d Zdravecky said, adding, \u201cRight now, in the world that we\u2019re living in, Rick Scott has had a disastrous effect on the state and the women who live in it.\u201d\n\nJesus Jones was not playing in the background.\n\nAnyway, staunch Scott supporter state Sen. Anitere Flores, R-Miami, came to her idol\u2019s aid in an awkward manner. Asked about Scott\u2019s anti-choice, anti-woman record, she offered this as a sort of Babelfish interpretation.\n\n\u201cThis issue isn\u2019t anti-woman. This is about a new life,\u201d Flores told the Miami Herald. \u201cTechnology and medical advances have gotten to the point to say this baby, this fetus is alive. And the courts have ruled that a state has a compelling interest in protecting the child, protecting the life of the unborn.\u201d\n\nNever mind the women. Never mind them at all.", "article_metadata": {"layout": "Content Default", "description": "\u201cRick Scott cannot run from his record on women\u2019s issues \u2013 in our latest ad, \u2018Extreme,\u2019 we are holding Rick Scott accountable for his efforts...", "title": "The Republican war on women explodes in Florida | News | Orlando Weekly", "og": {"site_name": "Orlando Weekly", "description": "\u201cRick Scott cannot run from his record on women\u2019s issues \u2013 in our latest ad, \u2018Extreme,\u2019 we are holding Rick Scott accountable for his efforts...", "title": "The Republican war on women explodes in Florida", "url": "http://www.orlandoweekly.com/orlando/the-republican-war-on-women-explodes-in-florida/Content?oid=2242644", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://media1.fdncms.com/orlando/imager/the-republican-war-on-women-explodes-in-fl/u/slideshow/2325821/1754263.jpg", "height": 400}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://media1.fdncms.com/orlando/imager/the-republican-war-on-women-explodes-in-fl/u/slideshow/2325821/1754263.jpg"}, "description": "\u201cRick Scott cannot run from his record on women\u2019s issues \u2013 in our latest ad, \u2018Extreme,\u2019 we are holding Rick Scott accountable for his efforts...", "site": "@orlandoweekly", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "The Republican war on women explodes in Florida"}, "oid": 2242644, "fb": {"app_id": 1527160917534695}, "keywords": "News, Blog, Culture, Dining, Events", "google-site-verification": "s4GBlkstS6PKQwO_gDlOGL8jFPmeuL_d3m60wxOBQR0", "thumbnail": "http://media1.fdncms.com/orlando/imager/the-republican-war-on-women-explodes-in-fl/u/slideshow/2325821/1754263.jpg", "viewport": "width=1000", "news_keywords": "news, blog, culture, dining, events"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc358\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWhen it comes to doing what\u2019s right for Florida women, Rick Scott has been wrong every single time,\u201d says the last woman in the commercial.\nRick Scott, says every breeze blowing throughout Florida, is not very kind to women, politically speaking.\nThat \u201cwar on women\u201d thing isn\u2019t going anywhere, Republicans.\nWhile all of this hell-hath-no-fury bluster was pumping out of the Crist corner, Scott was campaigning with lovebucket New Jersey Gov.\nThe dynamic duo were quick to make sure that questions about Crist focus on what\u2019s right here and what\u2019s right now."}
