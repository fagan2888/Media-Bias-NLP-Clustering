New ads funded by the Republican Governors Association (RGA) will hit the Kentucky airwaves Wednesday, as an offshoot of the RGA ramps up the war of words in the state’s toss-up gubernatorial election.

Listing an address at the RGA’s Washington office in a disclosure form made to local Lexington station WKYT, the Putting Kentucky First committee has requested air time on broadcast stations in Lexington, Louisville and Cincinnati, which straddles the Kentucky border.

From the spot, which went live on WKYT Wednesday:

Obama’s liberal agenda has hurt Kentucky. Jack Conway runs for governor as an Obama liberal, with more vague promises. Sound familiar? Conway supported Obama on cap and trade; it’s been called a national energy tax that could kill thousands of Kentucky jobs and hike our utility rates. Conway supported Obamacare, stating he would have been proud to vote for it.

Though a copy of the committee’s statement of organization is not yet publicly available on the state’s registry of election finance, The organization describes itself as “a project of the Republican Governor’s Association” on its website. The site, dedicated to attacking Democratic candidate Jack Conway, makes clear that this year’s governor’s race will center around many of the same the as last year’s hot-button Senate battle, in which Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell and Democrat Allison Lundergan Grimes traded accusations of selling out Kentucky coal interests in the face of President Obama’s environmental agenda.

Conway’s opponent, Republican Matt Bevin, lost a largely self-funded campaign to McConnell in last year's Republican primary. He will have another shot at elected office November 3.
