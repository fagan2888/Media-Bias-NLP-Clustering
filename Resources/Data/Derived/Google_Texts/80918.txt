ESTES PARK -- The Rocky Mountain Nature Association has announced a drive to get the Colorado legislature to create a Rocky Mountain National Park license plate.

The group will be taking signatures from Colorado residents on a petition for the special license plate through Dec. 20.

The proposed license plate design features a bull elk under a starry sky with alpine tundra flowers and reads, "Rocky Mountain National Park."

Organizers hope it can be made by 2015 to coincide with Rocky Mountain National Park's centennial celebration.

Signatures of 3,000 Colorado registered vehicle owners are needed to bring a bill to the Colorado legislature in January 2014.

Those signatures also are a pledge to buy a plate if the bill is approved by the legislature. An additional $25 charge will apply and will be donated to the Rocky Mountain Nature Association, which will use the money generated to support education programs in the park.
