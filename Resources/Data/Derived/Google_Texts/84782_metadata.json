As the founder and executive director of the group that is teaching girls about engineering and technology, Rivas had to solve for many variables as she transitioned to her dream job. Health insurance was at the top of the list.\n\nOn October 1 open enrollment for insurance under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), or \u201cObamacare,\u201d began. A study published in May predicted that the ACA would have the effect of creating 1.5 million more entrepreneurs nationwide, but how many of those will come from populations that traditionally are under-represented in the entrepreneurial world?\n\nRivas is almost 40, unmarried, and a freshly minted female entrepreneur who said that to her, healthcare is a \u201cbig deal.\u201d While she said that health insurance won\u2019t be the one thing to deter an entrepreneur, it is something that can be difficult to put to the back of your mind if you\u2019re a woman and a Latina.\n\n\u201cI was concerned,\u201d Rivas tells TechCrunch. \u201cI think it\u2019s important for me because my family doesn\u2019t have a lot of money to cover me if something were to happen. I think that\u2019s very common for some Latinas.\u201d\n\nLatinos have historically had one of the highest uninsured rates in the country, for example, and in some states more than 25 percent of adult women do not have health insurance.\n\nFor women entrepreneurs, healthcare is an important part of the decision to take the startup plunge \u2014 but it\u2019s just one factor, said Shaherose Charania, CEO and Co-Founder of Women 2.0, which works to promote women in technology.\n\nCharania said healthcare access is a huge building block to entrepreneurship, and the ACA is one step towards removing that barrier for women and minorities, but also people with pre-existing conditions. The wider availability of health insurance may not necessarily create a huge wave of change for women, she said \u2014 but it will be a positive change for everyone.\n\nOne big change the ACA makes that\u2019s particularly pertinent to women is that one of the 10 essential health benefits every insurance plan must now cover is maternity care. Although gender and ethnic data is not available, thus far in California\u2019s insurance exchange, health insurance applications for 777,000 people were started between October 1 and November 30; with an additional 144,146 applications the first week of December.\n\nThese plans will be available to people who make 400 percent above the poverty level or less, which is about $45,000 a year for an individual, according to Sarah Sol an information officer for the state\u2019s insurance exchange, Covered California.\n\nTo date, startups and entrepreneurs have dealt with the health insurance issue in a few different ways. Some have purchased individual plans, which for women may not have included maternity care in the event of a pregnancy (post-Obamacare, some of these individual plans may become more expensive). Others have opted to bite the bullet and pay high monthly fees for insurance plans that will cover them. Finally, a popular and unfortunate decision for some entrepreneurs, especially those who are bootstrapping, is to simply make do without it.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t had health insurance in quite some time. It just came down to money: money in, money out,\u201d said Jesse Martinez, co-founder of the Latino Startup Alliance. \u201cIt\u2019s in the back of your mind \u2014 \u2018What if something happens?\u2019 Most entrepreneurs are doing that. If you can get by without it, people will, that\u2019s the risk that they take.\u201d\n\nThose interviewed by TechCrunch could not make a definitive statement as to whether the ACA would push more minorities and women to pursue entrepreneurship, but the general consensus is that removing barriers like health insurance certainly wouldn\u2019t hurt.\n\nPatricia Martinez founded the women\u2019s mobile health platform Healthgauge, and believes the ACA is opening the door to more market disruption and innovation by removing the barrier of health insurance, and allowing people to become self-employed more easily.\n\n\u201cA large number of women and Latino entrepreneurs and small business owners are parents and or possess pre-existing conditions,\u201d she said, noting this is in great contrast to the idea of the young, white male entrepreneur.\n\n\u201cThe ACA is removing this barrier for working mothers, Latinos with pre-existing diseases, and giving them the opportunity to join the rest of the startup community.\u201d\n\nAfrican Americans are another group underrepresented in the nation\u2019s startup community, but with the added problems of suffering higher rates of illnesses than other groups, especially cancer. And African American entrepreneurs aren\u2019t as likely to have access to investment capital as their white counterparts, meaning they are more likely to forgo spending on health insurance, said Jewell Sparks, CEO and Founder of Strategic Diversity Group and BiTHouse.\n\nThus, removing the uncertainty of health insurance via the ACA will certainly help African-American entrepreneurs, but exactly how much has yet to be ascertained.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t say that having access to health insurance will inspire more minorities to become entrepreneurs, but I can say it will make decisions regarding the maintenance of one\u2019s health care easier,\u201d Sparks said.\n\nRivas and others believe health insurance access is an important win for women, Latino and African-American entrepreneurs. But in Rivas\u2019 case, when it comes to getting her startup going, there\u2019s plenty else to occupy her mind.\n\n\u201cI have enough funding to cover DIY Girls for eight months, but if eight months comes by and I haven\u2019t raised any money, that\u2019s it,\u201d she said.\n\n[Tables via Covered California and California Department of Health Services]", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "<a href=\"/author/sara-ines-calderon/\" title=\"Posts by Sara In\u00e9s Calder\u00f3n\" onclick=\"s_objectID='river_author';\" rel=\"author\">Sara In\u00e9s Calder\u00f3n</a> <span class=\"twitter-handle\">(<a href=\"https://twitter.com/sarachicad\" rel=\"external\">@sarachicad</a>)</span>", "application-name": "TechCrunch", "twitter": {"description": "Two months ago Luz Rivas walked away from her job to work full-time on her startup, DIY Girls.
