Electronic health records helped streamline data input and provided staff with more reliable clinical data and allowed the to efficiently use valuable critical care resources.\n\nPatient care activity grew 4.3 percent over the previous year, and all three U-M hospitals had occupancy rates of approximately 88 percent. Additionally, the number of people discharged outpaced projections, increasing 4.8 percent year over year.\n\n\"Thanks to the hard work of more than 22,000, including physician faculty, leaders and staff, we continue to grow and strengthen our ability to provide value to those we serve, including patients from every county of Michigan and beyond,\" Denton said.\n\n\"A wide range of other projects and initiatives have also helped keep UMHS finances on target during fiscal year 2014, including stepped-up efforts to manage expense growth, improve productivity and provide ideal patient experiences.\"\n\nOfficials said that the UMHS still has to assess the full financial impact of the Affordable Care Act on its clinical operations and financial health. ACA was implemented late in the 2014 fiscal year.\n\nDuring the fiscal year 2014, UMHS provided more than $152 million in uncompensated care. Increased insurance coverage is likely to reduce that figure in coming years.\n\nAt the same time, Health System chief financial officer Paul Castillo said, the pressure to provide high quality care and contain cost growth continues to be a focus.\n\n\"Our participation in the POM ACO Accountable Care Organization, which works to meet those aims for patients covered by traditional Medicare, supports this effort,\" he said.\n\n\"We can be very proud of achieving our financial target during a year of such change. But we'll continue our focus on operational efficiencies and all aspects of our revenue cycle.\"\n\nAdditional investments in capital projects to expand clinical capacity, including the opening of the Northville Health Center and a new Emergency Critical Care Center, will continue to take shape in FY15.\n\nThe Regents also unanimously approved a new budget for the 2015 fiscal year that aims for a 3 percent margin \u2013 or about $79 million in revenue over expenditures \u2013 on total revenues of $2.66 billion.\n\nThis projection is based on expected increases in patient activity among other things. The bulk of the increased patient activity is expected to come from the new Northville Health Center \u2013 which will open in July \u2013 and its two additional on-site operating rooms.\n\nCastillo said the 3 percent margin of $79 million would depend heavily on a projected 4 percent growth in adjusted case activity and new patient capacities.\n\nThe health system is also expected to shave costs through \"ongoing initiatives to improve quality, productivity and supply optimization\" and an expected 1.4 percent increase in cost for each patient visits.\n\nThe 2015 budget includes a 4.9 percent increase in payroll expenditures, a 5.4 percent increase in supply costs and a 2.5 percent reduction in non-salary spending.\n\nA revenue increase is expected from the December 2013 proposed affiliation between UMHS and Allegiance Health. That proposal is still in the due diligence phase, but should be finalized during the 2015 fiscal year.", "article_metadata": {"article_author": "Jeremy Allen | jallen42@mlive.com", "medium": "news", "news_keywords": "aa-business,um-regents,umhs,University of Michigan,university-of-michigan", "title": "U-M Health System ends 2014 fiscal year with $17.3 million surplus; regents adopt $2.66B 2015 budget", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"U-M Health System ends 2014 fiscal year with $17.3 million surplus; regents adopt $2.66B 2015 budget\", \"link\": \"http://www.mlive.com/business/ann-arbor/index.ssf/2014/06/u-m_health_system_ends_2014_fi.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.mlive.com/home/mlive-media/width620/img/annarbornews_impact/photo/14868518-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"13231684\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-06-19T21:56:08Z\", \"author\": \"Jeremy Allen | jallen42@mlive.com\", \"tags\": [\"@aa-news\",\"@aa-river\",\"@mlive-business\",\"@mlive-health\",\"@mlive-news\",\"aa-business\",\"um-regents\",\"umhs\",\"University of Michigan\",\"university-of-michigan\"] }", "twitter": {"site": "@mlive", "image": "http://media.mlive.com/annarbornews_impact/photo/14868518-thumb_square_large.jpg", "description": "The 2015 budget includes a 4.9 percent increase in payroll expenditures, a 5.4 percent increase in supply costs and a 2.5 percent reduction in non-salary spending.", "card": "summary", "creator": "@JeremyAllenA2"}, "article_date_updated": "Friday, June 20, 2014,  8:20 AM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.mlive.com/annarbornews_impact/photo/umhs-af9c4a8d8c7af9ca.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"jallen42\", \"author_nickname\": \"Jeremy Allen | jallen42@mlive.com\", \"author_id\": \"10404863\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Ann Arbor Business\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.mlive.com/business/ann-arbor/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "MLive.com", "description": "The 2015 budget includes a 4.9 percent increase in payroll expenditures, a 5.4 percent increase in supply costs and a 2.5 percent reduction in non-salary spending.", "title": "U-M Health System ends 2014 fiscal year with $17.3 million surplus; regents adopt $2.66B 2015 budget", "url": "http://www.mlive.com/business/ann-arbor/index.ssf/2014/06/u-m_health_system_ends_2014_fi.html", "image": "http://media.mlive.com/design/alpha/img/logo_mlive.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "MLive.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Thursday, June 19, 2014,  5:50 PM", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "Description": "The 2015 budget includes a 4.9 percent increase in payroll expenditures, a 5.4 percent increase in supply costs and a 2.5 percent reduction in non-salary spending."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe26a7\"", "article_summary": "Patient care activity grew 4.3 percent over the previous year, and all three U-M hospitals had occupancy rates of approximately 88 percent.\nThis projection is based on expected increases in patient activity among other things.\nOfficials said that the UMHS still has to assess the full financial impact of the Affordable Care Act on its clinical operations and financial health.\nDuring the fiscal year 2014, UMHS provided more than $152 million in uncompensated care.\nThe University of Michigan Health System told the Board of Regents Thursday it expects to close its 2014 fiscal year on June 30 on a high note."}
