My health insurance covers the pill, which means all I have to worry about is getting him between the covers. I got insurance.\"\n\n\n\nAnother ad called \"Uniform Coverage\" depicts two young girls who have apparently just finished an extraordinarily violent game of soccer:\n\n\n\nA particularly deranged-looking machete-wielding boy is shown carving a pumpkin (and presumably his hand):\n\n\n\nAnd \"shotskis\", because Colorado:\n\n\n\nThe campaign also features a new keg stand-loving \"gargoyling bro\" named Sam, because of course:\n\n\n\nAnd Ryan Gosling because Ryan Gosling:\n\n\n\nSo why the focus on young women this time around? Jen Caltrider of ProgressNow Colorado Education said in a statement: \u201cI watch a lot of football, so I\u2019m not really surprised keg stands and red solo cups are the way to reach 20-something guys. Those guys signing up for insurance is only half the equation. We need to reach 20-something women, as well, and we hope this round of ads will do that.\u201d\n\nTake a look at more of the ads below or at DoYouGotInsurance.com:\n\nThe original \"Brosurance\" boys\n\nStress Relief\n\nProof Of Insurance\n\nTriage\n\nHey Girl 2\n\nPain Killers\n\nHealthy Tips\n\nLet's Get Physical\n\nTrick or Treat It\n\nFriends with Benefits\n\nUniform Coverage\n\nFlexible Benefits\n\nDaily Dose\n\nKeg-ER\n\nAlso on HuffPost: Health Care Reform Efforts Throughout History Health Care Reform Efforts Throughout History\n\n1 of 17 1912 Former President Theodore Roosevelt champions national health insurance as he unsuccessfully tries to ride his progressive Bull Moose Party back to the White House.
