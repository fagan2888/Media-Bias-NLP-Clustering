Florida Sen. Marco Rubio’s super PAC is blasting New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie’s record in his home state in a pair of new ads airing in New Hampshire.

The ads from Conservatives Solutions PAC, highlights New Jersey’s lackluster economic record, out-migration, and the host of new fees and taxes Christie has signed into law, as well as Christie’s early support for the Common Core education standards (he’s since reversed course) and expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.

The ads are a “significant part of an ongoing multi-million dollar buy in New Hampshire,” according to a spokesperson for the super PAC. The initial ad in the series also targeted Kasich, who trails both politicians in the polls.

One of the ads, “Favorite,” asserts that Christie is President Obama’s favorite GOP governor, featuring the photo of their meeting on the tarmac in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy in 2012—a photo-op many conservatives believe helped Obama secure his re-election, which has been mythologized as a “hug” by many on the Right.

Rubio and Christie are competing for many of the same establishment voters in Iowa and New Hampshire. Last week, Christie blasted Rubio for his missed votes in the Senate, and has frequently lobbed criticism at the Senator for having a short list of accomplishments in office.
