The Dream Act, passed in 2001, gives in-state tuition to undocumented students who graduate from Texas high schools.\n\nSchool Funding\n\nDemocratic candidates talked a lot about restoring public education funding state lawmakers cut in 2011. The Legislature also faces a judge\u2019s ruling that says the state\u2019s school finance plan is \u201cunconstitutional\u201d because the state isn\u2019t spending enough for students to meet standards Texas has set. Ramsey believes legislators will postpone questions of increased school spending until the state\u2019s appeal of the judge\u2019s ruling is heard by the Texas Supreme Court. That could be a year or two away. In the meantime, significant new school funding is unlikely.\n\nA Texas Solution On Medicaid\n\nSome Republicans and Democrats in the Texas Legislature have said they want to again try to come up with a Texas plan to draw down the $100 billion in federal Medicaid money the state gave up when it rejected Obamacare. Ramsey believes this election makes it less likely lawmakers will back a solution to expand Medicaid and bring those dollars to Texas.\n\nAs for what kind of voice Democrats will have at the Capitol?\n\n\u201cElections have consequences,\u201d Ramsey said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be tough on the Democrats for a while.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics", "description": "Tuesday's Republican sweep added a new layer of conservatism to state government in Texas.
