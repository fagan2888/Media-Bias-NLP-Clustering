The CEO of the federal governments’ health insurance program said even though fewer than half of eligible Kansans and Missourians have signed up for the program, he’s not discouraged.

Kevin Counihan, the CEO of Healthcare.gov, was in Kansas City Thursday to encourage people to sign up before the deadline.

He said even though a lot of eligible people haven’t finished the process yet, sign-ups are up 30 percent.

“Are we doing a perfect job? Absolutely no. Do we have a perfect exchange? Absolutely not,” Counihan said. “I think we’re doing well.”

Neither Kansas nor Missouri have set up their own exchanges, so the exchanges in those two states are administered by Washington. Only 44 percent of eligible Missourians have signed up. In Kansas, only 30 percent of eligible people have. The national average is 41 percent.

Counihan said he looks at hard numbers and not percentages. He said 11 million people are signed up in 2016 and more than 3 million of those sign-ups are new.

One thing many people are watching is the rate of premium increases this year. The Kaiser Foundation analysis, using a popular version of a plan for a 40-year-old making $30,000 per year shows a 13 percent increase in Kansas rates and a 4 percent increase in Missouri.

Counihan hopes people will be patient.

“This is a four to five-year implementation,” he said. “I know we live in a culture where we want everything to be perfect and running right away. Something which is new like this, and complicated, takes a little bit more time.”

The deadline to sign up is Jan. 31.
