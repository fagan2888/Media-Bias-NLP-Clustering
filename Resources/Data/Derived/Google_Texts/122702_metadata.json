Marco Rubio tried, and failed, to pin down his main adversary of the evening, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. He pointed out how badly Christie\u2019s state had fared, economically, under his leadership suffering, among other things, nine credit rating downgrades and extremely slow job growth.\n\nChristie, without addressing the issue, swatted aside Rubio\u2019s criticism as a \u201cdrive-by\u201d shot at his record. But on Sunday morning, in an interview on Fox News Sunday, host Chris Wallace brought it up again, and this time it wasn\u2019t as easy to avoid.\n\nRelated: How Rubio\u2019s Stumble Could Derail Him as the \u2018Establishment Candidate\u2019\n\nSo, Christie resorted to a form of deflection familiar to anybody who has watched the classic comedy Animal House. In the film, when a crew of debauched frat brothers is finally called to account before a university court, and confronted with incontrovertible evidence of their misdeeds, one of the leaders of the group stands up to address the judges.\n\nHow can they blame a whole fraternity for the actions of a few individuals, he demands.\n\n\u201cFor if you do, then shouldn't we blame the whole fraternity system? And if the whole fraternity system is guilty, then isn't this an indictment of our educational institutions in general? [I] sn\u2019t this an indictment of our entire American society?\u201d\n\nThen, reaching his soaring finale, he concludes, \u201cWell, you can do whatever you want to us, but we're not going to sit here and listen to you badmouth the United States of America!\u201d With that, he leads the entire fraternity out of the courtroom, humming the Star Spangled Banner.\n\nRelated: Trump \u2013 Losing Iowa Wasn\u2019t My Fault\n\nChristie didn\u2019t storm out of the studio, but rather than defend his record on jobs and growth \u2013 arguably the worst of any governor in the aftermath of the Great Recession \u2013 he instead went on the attack against Wallace.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to let anybody insult the people of New Jersey, who have worked hard to bring our state back,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBy the way, in the midst of all that, too, we were hit with the second worst natural disaster in American history that devastated our state,\u201d he said, in reference to Hurricane Sandy. \u201cIn light of that, to have this comeback that we\u2019ve had in 2015 is extraordinary and the people of New Jersey deserve great credit and I am honored to lead them. And I\u2019m not going to let Marco Rubio or anybody else, even you my friend, insult the people that I represent.\u201d\n\nA bemused-looking Wallace noted that he hadn\u2019t said a word about the people of New Jersey, but was referring to the state\u2019s economic performance under Christie\u2019s leadership. But Christie again tried to turn Wallace\u2019s question into an assault on his constituents.\n\nRelated: Why Carson Might Poison the Well for Cruz with Evangelicals\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s their state. It\u2019s not just my state. It\u2019s their state. Like it\u2019s our country. And I\u2019m not going to allow people to insult the effort of the people of New Jersey,\u201d he said.\n\nAt this point, Wallace essentially gave up and moved on. But it\u2019s worth noting that Christie\u2019s straw man argument is the kind of cheap rhetorical trick that Christie himself would have pilloried an opponent for making on the debate stage.\n\nImagine a Democrat trying to defend against attacks on President Barack Obama\u2019s economic record by claiming that any criticism is tantamount to insulting the citizens of the U.S. If that were a valid argument, the Republican presidential candidates would have to abandon half of the material they use on the stump.\n\nDepending on the results in tomorrow\u2019s New Hampshire primary, we may not have Chris Christie to kick around much longer anyhow. But his state\u2019s economic performance under his leadership is a vulnerability, he knows it, and at the moment, he doesn\u2019t seem to have a good response to critics who point it out.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "In an effort to avoid tough questions about his economic record, Republican presidential hopeful and New Jersey Gov.
