But it captures the essence of the change from a fee-for-service model in health care to one in which hospitals and health care providers are paid for value and charged with promoting a healthy community.\n\n\"We have to figure out how to promote the health of the population and keep them out of our hospitals,\" Loomis said. \"We work really hard every day to keep people out of our hospitals. That is the right thing to do - for our community and for our country.\"\n\nMercy Health leaders met with area educators Thursday, March 26, at Grand Valley University at Building Talent Bridges, a meeting to discuss how to collaborate in building a pipeline of diverse students with the skills to meet the needs of health care organizations.\n\nThat shift to value-based payments, promoted by the Affordable Care Act, comes in response to the steady rise in health care costs. The U.S. spends $2.8 trillion a year on health care, about 18 percent of the GDP, Loomis said.\n\n\"Health care is going through tremendous change right now,\" he said. \"The talent needed in the future is different from the talent needed in the past.\"\n\nMercy Health hires about 1,000 employees a year, but Loomis said those new hires increasingly are not working in the hospital, but in ambulatory care settings or in doctor's offices. Primary care physicians, in particular, are increasingly working with a health care team to help patients stay healthy or care for chronic conditions.\n\n\"The physician will still be very important. But the team they now must work with is changing rapidly,\" he said. \"Medical assistants, pharmacists and social workers are needed at numbers like we have never seen before.\"\n\nParticipants in the conference included representatives from Grand Rapids Urban League, Michigan Works, University of Detroit Mercy, GVSU,\n\nMuskegon Area Intermediate School District, Muskegon Community College, Grand Rapids Community College, Goodwill Industries, Baker College\n\nMichigan State University College of Human Medicine and West Michigan Center for Arts and Technology.\n\nSue Thoms covers health care for MLive/The Grand Rapids Press.
