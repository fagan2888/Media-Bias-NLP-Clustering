On top of that, she required use of an oxygen tank. Despite her poor health, she was cleared by her doctor to have 18 teeth pulled due to an infection, Fox 2 reported.\n\nHowever, when she arrived to the dentist Friday morning accompanied by her sister, Crystal Cutright, for the procedure, the medical assistant seemed concerned after taking her vital signs.\n\n\u201cHer heart rate was still 130, the dentist came in, ready to do the procedure,\" Amber Waddell, Walters\u2019 daughter, told Fox 2. \"The dental assistant said 'I am waiting for her heart rate to come down.' The dentist said 'We're fine' and the procedure starts.\"\n\nWalters previously has been turned away from this dental procedure due to an elevated heart rate, but this time the dentist decided to go through with the procedure. After pulling 16 of the 18 teeth, the dentist stopped due to Walters high heart rate and told her, \u201cI think you need to go to the doctor and get your heart checked on,\u201d Waddell said, and sent her home.\n\nCutright and her husband James escorted Walters and her oxygen tank back to the car, and that's when Walters started having difficulty breathing. Cutright noticed that her sister\u2019s oxygen tank had run out so she went back to the dentist office for help. She said the staff came out with more oxygen; however, that didn\u2019t seem to help, and no one from the doctor\u2019s office knew how to administer CPR.\n\n\"They didn't do no CPR or anything,\" Waddell said. \"They were just rubbing her chest.\u201d\n\n\"When the dentist came out she started yelling 'I told you to take her to the hospital,' so I yelled back at her 'I have to get her in the car in order for that to happen,\u2019\u201d Cutright told Fox2.\n\nAn ambulance was called but Walters could not be revived.\n\nPast research has linked invasive dental procedures to heart risks. One study in particular found that tooth extractions could up the risk of a heart attack of stroke within the four weeks after their dental treatment, and the likely culprit is inflammation. Researchers found that dental surgery can increase inflammation in the body \u201cas it responds to bacteria entering the bloodstream following surgery,\u201d Live Science reported.\n\n\"We feel deeply for what happened,\" Caroline Oldsey, who works at the dentist office\u2019s human resources office, told Fox 2. \"Our thoughts go out to them. Our thoughts and prayers are with them.\"\n\nAn investigation into Walters\u2019 death is underway. Her family is awaiting results from an autopsy.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "michigan, woman, series, health, issues, dies, dentist, parking, lot, after, having, 16, teeth", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A Michigan woman died after an invasive dental procedure, and now her family wants answers.", "title": "Woman Dies In Dentist Parking Lot After Having 16 Teeth Pulled", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/dentist-visit-16-teeth-removed-april-walters-dies-382255", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/04/17/dentist.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A Michigan woman died after an invasive dental procedure, and now her family wants answers.", "title": "Woman Dies In Dentist Parking Lot After Having 16 Teeth Pulled", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/dentist-visit-16-teeth-removed-april-walters-dies-382255", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/04/17/dentist.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/04/17/dentist.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2016-04-17T12:34:50-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-17T12:36:25-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A Michigan woman died after an invasive dental procedure, and now her family wants answers."}, "article_summary": "\u201cHer heart rate was still 130, the dentist came in, ready to do the procedure,\" Amber Waddell, Walters\u2019 daughter, told Fox 2.\n\"The dental assistant said 'I am waiting for her heart rate to come down.'\nApril Walters, 46, suffered from a series of health issues, including sarcoidosis, asthma, COPD, high blood pressure, and diabetes.\nWalters previously has been turned away from this dental procedure due to an elevated heart rate, but this time the dentist decided to go through with the procedure.\nDespite her poor health, she was cleared by her doctor to have 18 teeth pulled due to an infection, Fox 2 reported."}
