The citizens of Carter Lake gathered at Thomas Jefferson high school in Council Bluffs, Iowa, and voted for the Republican nominee for President of the United States. There was a barefoot baby in attendance along with two elderly women in wheelchairs. Voters and official campaign representatives gave short speeches, votes were cast and then counted in public on the high school stage. One couldn\u2019t help to be proud of America after witnessing the event.\n\nCarter Lake, Iowa is on the western bank of the Missouri river. The river moved years ago and part of Iowa was stranded in Nebraska. For people who use Omaha\u2019s Eppley airport there are signs on the road that point out this geographic anomaly that confounds the uninitiated. So note that the voters had to drive some distance to attend the caucus in Council Bluffs.\n\nSpeaking for the Jeb Bush campaign as an official spokesman was former Omaha mayor Hal Daub. California congressman Doug LaMalfa spoke for Marco Rubio. Some campaigns had official spokesmen read prepared speeches. Two voters gave unofficial one-minute speeches for Donald Trump. A man whose grandfather legally immigrated from Mexico said Trump\u2019s immigration policy makes sense to him. He was also angry that the GOP had \u201cbetrayed\u201d him after gaining control of the House and Senate and accomplishing nothing.\n\nThe star of the show was a retired Army master sergeant. He said that the federal government was not adequately caring for vets, the military had been gutted, the rules of engagement were wrong and that terrorists were being allowed into the country. He received applause from the crowd when he said the Second Amendment had to be defended and that Obamacare sucks.\n\nThe entire crowd cheered when a party official said that tonight was the beginning of the end of the Obama administration.\n\nThe votes were counted out in the open on the stage. Trump, 63 (47%), Cruz, 40 (30%) and Rubio 12 (9%). Carly Fiorina had two votes. I did not vote nor did I try to do so. Council Bluffs is not Chicago.\n\nA total of 133 people voted. A party official said only 50 had voted at the last caucus.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Power Line", "description": "Nebraska attorney David Begley winds up his reports from Iowa for us with this account of last night\u2019s GOP caucus in Carter Lake: It was a scene right out of a Norman Rockwell painting.
