That makes it wise borrowing.\u201d\n\nIn January NYU is opening the NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering in downtown Brooklyn \u2014 one of the last major initiatives of Mr. Sexton\u2019s presidency, which ends in 2016. The engineering school is NYU\u2019s 14th school in total and will cost $40,000 per year.\n\nMr. Sexton has been criticized for devising potentially costly expansion plans while student debt surges, but he said an NYU education is a prudent investment.\n\n\u201cWe provide the highest quality education we can, so when a student borrows to go to college, they\u2019re getting as much value as they can. We prepare them for a joyful, useful, prosperous \u2014 however they define prosperous \u2014 life. If you borrow wisely, it\u2019s okay. If you borrow $28,000 to buy two sports cars, that\u2019s a different kind of borrowing. A college education will stay with you for life. A sports car will be worth half as much the minute you drive it into the streets.\u201d\n\nThat said, \u201cour single highest priority right now at NYU is raising money for financial aid,\u201d Mr. Sexton said.\n\nThe university president said it is unlikely that NYU will open another school during his tenure. \u201cMy job now is to create an organic transition to the next team,\u201d he said.\n\nAsked who he thinks should or will succeed him, Mr. Sexton said he has \u201cno idea at all,\u201d but is \u201ccurious.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019ll find out \u201cin due time,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "As New York University president John Sexton begins the final two years of his tenure, he will consider issues such as student debt, the value of an NYU education and who his successor will be, he said in a recent interview.", "title": "NYU President Focusing on Fundraising for Student Financial Aid", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2013/12/26/nyu-president-focusing-on-fundraising-for-student-financial-aid/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-AX083_nynyu_G_20131226104302.jpg"}, "site": "WSJNY", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "New York", "article.headline": "NYU President Focusing on Fundraising for Student Financial Aid", "description": "As New York University president John Sexton begins the final two years of his tenure, he will consider issues such as student debt, the value of an NYU education and who his successor will be, he said in a recent interview.", "article_section": "New York", "author": "Mike Vilensky", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "testkeys": "C", "article.page": "Metropolis Blog", "page.subsection": "Metropolis", "article.summary": "As New York University president John Sexton begins the final two years of his tenure, he will consider issues such as student debt, the value of an NYU education and who his successor will be, he said in a recent interview.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.published": "2013-12-26T15:44:40-05:00", "dj.asn": "10-161", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2013/12/26/nyu-president-focusing-on-fundraising-for-student-financial-aid/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-METROB-19431", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "New York", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "As New York University president John Sexton begins the final two years of his tenure, he will consider issues such as student debt, the value of an NYU education and who his successor will be, he said in a recent interview.", "title": "NYU President Focusing on Fundraising for Student Financial Aid", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2013/12/26/nyu-president-focusing-on-fundraising-for-student-financial-aid/", "image": {"width": 553, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-AX083_nynyu_G_20131226104302.jpg", "height": 369}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Metropolis", "article.id": "BL-METROB-19431", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2013-12-26T16:35:36-05:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf5c8\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe care about student debt,\u201d Mr. Sexton said.\nMr. Sexton has been criticized for devising potentially costly expansion plans while student debt surges, but he said an NYU education is a prudent investment.\nThe engineering school is NYU\u2019s 14th school in total and will cost $40,000 per year.\nAndrew Hinderaker for The Wall Street Journal The library building at the NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering campus in Brooklyn.\nAsked who he thinks should or will succeed him, Mr. Sexton said he has \u201cno idea at all,\u201d but is \u201ccurious.\u201dHe\u2019ll find out \u201cin due time,\u201d he said."}
