On Wednesday, Gardiner stayed flexible on the issue.\n\n\u201cThere probably should be some sort of an overall discussion,\u201d Gardiner said. \u201cIn the Senate, we continue to remain open to the dialogue, but we understand the realities in which we live.\u201d\n\nThe reality is that while Crisafulli didn\u2019t absolutely rule out the possibility of an alternative health-care plan, he called Medicaid \u201ca broken system.\u201d He also pointed with pride to the Legislature\u2019s 2011 Medicaid overhaul, which moved most beneficiaries into HMOs and other types of managed-care plans.\n\nGardiner said he\u2019d been watching developments in Indiana, where Republican Gov. Mike Pence announced Tuesday that his state had accepted federal funding under the Affordable Care Act for an alternative to expanding Medicaid. The Indiana plan is expected to extend health-care coverage to 350,000 people.\n\nGardiner, R-Orlando, and Crisafulli, R-Merritt Island, were sworn into the Legislature\u2019s top positions in November and are preparing for the March 3 start of the legislative session. They agreed on most of a legislative agenda, such as tax cuts, water policy, controls on high-stakes testing, more funding for education and the environment, adoption incentives and a plan to expand economic independence for people with disabilities.\n\nOn tax cuts, Crisafulli quoted House Finance & Tax Chairman Matt Gaetz, R-Fort Walton Beach, saying, \u201cNo tax is safe.\u201d Gardiner added, \u201cIt\u2019s a belief that the dollars are better with the taxpayers.\u201d\n\nOn water policy, the Senate president and House speaker agreed that Florida must make a permanent commitment to maintaining access to clean water in every part of the state. They also pledged transparency in legislative spending under Amendment I, a conservation ballot initiative that passed in November with 75 percent of the vote.\n\nThe Senate president, whose son Andrew was born with Down syndrome, presented a six-point plan to promote educational and vocational opportunities for Floridians with \u2014 as Gardiner likes to call them \u2014 \u201cunique abilities.\u201d The plan would establish a statewide postsecondary designation for such students, expand scholarships, teach financial literacy and honor businesses that hire workers with disabilities.\n\nOn high-stakes testing, Crisafulli said he didn\u2019t believe the state could \u201cback down\u201d from such accountability, because it had produced \u201cremarkable results.\u201d But to parents and teachers who argue that testing has taken over the education process, he said, \u201cWe hear you.\u201d\n\nHe said lawmakers were discussing making more information about testing requirements available to the public.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s duplication in testing from district to district, with regard to what the districts are doing with the overlay of the state,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to look at that. \u2026 Some of these tests that are taking place are certainly state tests, but there are also county tests or district tests that are being put on top of that.\u201d\n\nBut Senate Minority Leader Arthenia Joyner, D-Tampa, said parents are \u201crebelling against high-stakes testing. It\u2019s reached critical mass, and I believe the politicians are listening to the people.\u201d\n\nOn medical marijuana, too, Joyner said the majority of Floridians support it, as evidenced by the nearly 58 percent who voted to legalize therapeutic pot in November.\n\n\u201cThe people have spoken, and it appears my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are listening,\u201d she said \u2014 a reference to a bill filed Monday by Sen. Jeff Brandes, R-St. Petersburg, that would allow patients to use marijuana if they suffer from diseases such as cancer, AIDS, epilepsy or multiple sclerosis.\n\nAs to the Democrats\u2019 legislative agenda, both Joyner and House Minority Leader Mark Pafford, D-West Palm Beach, tried to draw hope where they could in the Republican-dominated Legislature.\n\n\u201cWe want a full debate\u201d on Medicaid expansion, Pafford said. \u201cYou heard the speaker \u2014 he\u2019s not a never-say-never guy.\u201d\n\nJoyner, who said expanding Medicaid remains one of her top priorities, said she was hopeful because some members of powerful business lobbies are backing an alternative health-care coverage plan.\n\n\u201cMaybe this is the year Florida will embrace this concept that is so fundamental to the health care and economics of our state,\u201d she said.\n\n(The News Service of Florida\u2019s Margie Menzel contributed to this report.)", "article_metadata": {"description": "Florida's House speaker indicated he does not have plans to expand Medicaid coverage to an additional hundreds of thousands of residents during the next legislative session.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://miami.cbslocal.com/2015/01/28/house-speaker-no-plans-to-expand-medicaid-coverage/", "image": {"width": 1500, "secure_url": "https://cbsmiami.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/57260724.jpg?w=1500", "identifier": "https://cbsmiami.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/57260724.jpg?w=1500", "height": 1000}, "type": "article", "description": "Florida's House speaker indicated he does not have plans to expand Medicaid coverage to an additional hundreds of thousands of residents during the next legislative session.", "title": "House Speaker: 'No Plans' To Expand Medicaid Coverage"}, "twitter": {"site": "CBSmiami", "image": "https://cbsmiami.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/57260724.jpg?w=1500", "description": "Florida's House speaker indicated he does not have plans to expand Medicaid coverage to an additional hundreds of thousands of residents during the next legislative session.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "House Speaker: 'No Plans' To Expand Medicaid Coverage"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "News, Sports, Weather, Traffic and Miami's Best", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CBS Miami", "article": {"publisher": "http://facebook.com/cbsmiami", "author": "http://facebook.com/cbsmiami"}, "keywords": "news, affordable care act, florida health, florida health coverage, florida legislature, house finance & tax chairman matt gaetz, indiana, medicaid, medicaid coverage, medicaid coverage expansion, medicaid overhaul, republican gov. mike pence, senate president andy gardiner, steve crisafulli", "google-site-verification": "44caXBf4kjHeKKAT7ZZ89NaCX25utL_yRSa-qGpwIhY", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://miami.cbslocal.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/0984ebcee75feff1a6ce7f3d00419048?s=16", "news_keywords": "affordable care act, florida health, florida health coverage, florida legislature, house finance & tax chairman matt gaetz, indiana, medicaid, medicaid coverage, medicaid coverage expansion, medicaid overhaul, republican gov. mike pence, senate president andy gardiner, steve crisafulli"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1bc7\"", "article_summary": "Follow CBSMIAMI.COM: Facebook | TwitterTALLAHASSEE (CBSMiami/NSF) \u2014 Florida\u2019s House speaker indicated he does not have plans to expand Medicaid coverage to an additional hundreds of thousands of residents during the next legislative session.\nMike Pence announced Tuesday that his state had accepted federal funding under the Affordable Care Act for an alternative to expanding Medicaid.\n\u201cWe do not plan to do anything on Medicaid expansion,\u201d Steve Crisafulli told reporters and editors at the annual Associated Press Legislative Planning Day at the Capitol.\nThe Indiana plan is expected to extend health-care coverage to 350,000 people.\n\u201cThere\u2019s duplication in testing from district to district, with regard to what the districts are doing with the overlay of the state,\u201d he said."}
