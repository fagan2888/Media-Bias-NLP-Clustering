What this is really about is a tactic to get a higher stock price and to create rhetoric that points the blame at Obamacare and not the mismanagement on their side. This is about keeping the bonuses for executives and in the end they will keep the exchange because it is the best place for them to sell insurance, and it doesn\u2019t cost them anything. Over time, this is what will be profitable for them. Insurance companies will always make money.
