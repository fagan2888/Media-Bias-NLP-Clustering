JUST ABOUT EVERY DAY...WE HEAR MORE ABOUT HOW THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT IS AFFECTING LIVES. AND WHILE MANY DOCTORS ARE SEEING MORE PATIENTS...OUR GUESTS ARE A MEDICAL PRACTICE THAT INTENTIONALLY LIMITS ITS PATIENT BASE. LET'S WELCOME JAMES WHITE AND CASEY EDMONDS WITH PARTNER M-D IN GREENVILLE. LET'S START WITH AN EXPLANATION WITH WHAT EXACTLY PARTNER M-D IS... PartnerMD is a membership-based medical practice that was created as a solution to the frustration that many patients experience with traditional practice models. WHO ARE YOU TRYING TO REACH? We are looking to reach anyone who may be frustration with traditional practices and are looking for a more personalized, proactive care model. WHAT MAKES YOUR PRACTICE UNIQUE COMPARED TO OTHERS? http: The PartnerMD approach is rooted in strengthening the physician-patient relationship. We do this by limiting our physician's patient base so they have more time to spend with each patient. Whereas most traditional physicians see up to 40 patients a day, PartnerMD doctors only see 10 patients a day, giving them the time to build more personal relationships with their patients. Because of our smaller patient panels, you'll always be able to get same- or next-day appointments so there isn't a need to sit at an urgent care for a couple of hours. You'll also experience significantly less time in the waiting room and more, unhurried time in the exam room with your doctor. You also have a 24/7 direct line of communication with your doctor via cell phone and/or email, so when you wake up sick at 2am in the morning, you have a professional you can contact to help get you healthy quicker. WHAT DOES THE PRACTICE DO TO HELP PATIENTS MEET THEIR GOALS? Listen. Every patient is different, and the best way to help meet your patients goals are by taking the time to listen to them, really understand their medical history, and then come up with a plan specific to their needs and provide them with the empowerment to take control of their health. WHAT KIND OF A COMMITMENT IS REQUIRED FROM THE PATIENT? The only commitment from our patient is empowering themselves to continue taking care of their health; communicating with their doctor and wellness specialist on what is or isn't working, so they can continue working on solutions for the future. HAVE THE CHANGES IN HEALTH CARE AFFECTED YOUR PRACTICE? Absolutely. The health care system continues to shift. New regulations and more patients in the system have forced medical providers to see more patients each day, which ultimately results in rushed care. Unfortunately, many patients in the traditional practice aren't getting the medical care they deserve because their doctor's patient panels are so full. DOES INSURANCE COVER THIS? There is a monthly out-of-pocket fee to join PartnerMD, but PartnerMD works with almost all insurance carriers, HMO's and Medicare.
