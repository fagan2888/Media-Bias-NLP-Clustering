MIAMI (CBSMiami/AP) – When it comes residents without health insurance, Florida is number two in the nation.

But not in a good way.

U.S. Census Bureau figures released on Tuesday show that Florida had an uninsured rate of 24.3 percent in 2013. Only Texas had a higher rate at 24.8 percent.

The lowest rate was 4.3 percent in Massachusetts.

Despite the high ranking, Florida’s uninsured rate has declined since 2010 when it was 25.3 percent.

Federal figures released last month show that Florida is the state with the highest number of consumers buying health coverage through new insurance markets under the Affordable Care Act.

Florida’s roughly 1.6 million enrollees include both first time enrollees and some of the nearly 1 million Floridians who enrolled last year.
