Some of the more wide-ranging regulations, such as the Volker Rule, a banking regulation under Dodd-Frank financial reform, are not even included in the cost estimate.\n\nThe agenda outlines regulations that the administration is currently working on and hopes to finalize in the next year. Although it is likely some will be delayed, Sam Batkins, director of regulatory policy at American Action Forum, said the cost to the economy will depend on how quickly, or how slowly, agencies actually finalize regulations.\n\n\u201cRegulations, more or less, operate like hidden taxes,\u201d Batkins told the Washington Free Beacon. \u201cLast year the administration admitted that we had about $30 billion in new regulatory burdens, and that\u2019s just from cabinet agencies. Our estimate from all agencies was a little bit higher.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut that\u2019s $30 billion, that\u2019s roughly the same amount that taxes increased this year, with higher income and capital gains taxes, and higher Medicare taxes, as well,\u201d he said.\n\nAffordable Care Act regulations for the next year, if enacted, will cost $1.9 billion, including the calorie labeling provision, a rule that requires all food items in grocery stores to be marked. The Department of Health and Human Services plans to finalize the regulation in February, which will cost the industry an estimated $421.3 million, and take 10 million hours to comply.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re talking about every single possible item that you eat,\u201d Batkins said. \u201cA lot of that has already happened, when you\u2019re buying from the grocery store. But if you\u2019re going to Pizza Hut, then how would specials be affected? There are hundreds\u2014thousands different possible options you can get with some types of pizza places.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think they understand that there\u2019s a lot of maddening complexity, and whenever you see figures like 10 million plus hours of paperwork you know that there\u2019s a lot involved,\u201d he said.\n\nBatkins said many of the remaining regulations under the Affordable Care Act must be completed by next year due to deadlines set in the law.\n\n\u201cA lot of the Obamacare rulemaking will have to be finalized by 2014,\u201d he said. \u201cSomething that\u2019s not even on this list is the employer mandate, and the bulk of the analysis that has to go into that.\u201d\n\nEPA\u2019s Tier 3 Motor Vehicle Emission and Fuel Standards will require refiners to lower the amount of sulfur content in gasoline to 10 parts per million. The rule is scheduled to be final in February 2014, with an estimated cost of $35 billion.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to pass these costs along in the form of gas prices, the only question is how much,\u201d Batkins said. \u201cThe EPA says about a cent, you talk to industry, the figure is as high as 10 cents.\u201d\n\nThe report also details recently finalized regulations, which are not included in the cost estimate for next year. The list includes an affirmative action mandate for federal contractors to hire persons with disabilities, which was published in November, carrying $1 billion in costs, and 3.3 million hours in paperwork.\n\nThe rule states that the Federal Contract Compliance Programs Office requires contractors to \u201cengage in affirmative action and provide equal employment opportunity without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, disability, or status as a protected veteran.\u201d\n\nOverall, at the current pace of rulemaking for 2013, AAF estimates that the regulatory burden for the year will eclipse $110 billion.\n\n\u201cThe regulatory system sort of runs on autopilot, and even the administration doesn\u2019t have control over a lot of what happens,\u201d Batkins said. \u201cSo, you see this every year, it flies under the radar, and it\u2019s mainly because getting all this data together is not easy. You can\u2019t just go to the historical tables at the White House budget to see what the total cumulative regulatory burden is for all agencies.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that you see the regulatory apparatus on autopilot and it\u2019s $30 billion a year at least that often gets overlooked,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2022 Elizabeth Harrington is a staff writer for the Washington Free Beacon.
