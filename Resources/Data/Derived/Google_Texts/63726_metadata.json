John Moolenaar, R-Midland and Dr. Jeff Holmes, his Democratic opponent from Alma, did have a debate Monday night.\n\nOnly thing was, Holmes spoke in Alma and Moolenaar spoke in Cadillac.\n\nA debate between the two who are running to replace U.S. Rep. Dave Camp in the 4th district was planned by students at Alma College. But five days before the debate, Moolenaar withdrew and went to Cadillac for a meet and greet sponsored by the Cadillac Area Chamber of Commerce and the Northern Michigan Chamber Alliance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHolmes kept to his commitment in Alma and spoke before a good sized group of mostly Democrats at the Alma College Heritage Center.\n\nHe sent his son C. J. to speak at the Cadillac event at Baker College.\n\nThe event in Alma was sponsored by the students\u2019 Democratic party organization and Holmes was introduced by Professor Joanne Gilbert.\n\nAfter outlining a bit of his history as an Alma physician for 26 years and a member of the school board for 10 years, Holmes said he is a proponent of the Affordable Care Act or Obamacare.\n\n\u201cIt has increased taxes, saved money and saved lives,\u201d he said. \u201cThe savings have been better than expected.\u201d\n\nHe cited one patient of his, age 26, who was kept under her parents plan due to Obamacare and had a routine check up. Although she had no symptoms, a disease was discovered - and treated early - that might have been missed altogether if she\u2019d had to wait until she had a job that provided her with insurance coverage.\n\n\u201cIt was dramatically important to her,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also noted that the ACA needs improvement.\n\nOn the topic of business and economy, Holmes said he would like to see the colleges and universities in the area provide the research and \u201cpush it out\u201d to local entrepreneurs.\n\nHe said he wants to see sustainable, renewable energy and, he said, the country needs a tax reform.\n\n\u201cIt should be fair, simple, and business taxes should be reduced, removing loopholes,\u201d he said, adding that businesses should not be given incentives to move jobs overseas.\n\nLater, Holmes said that he was impressed with Camp\u2019s tax reform proposal, although he would change some of the things in it.\n\nIronically, according to the Cadillac News, Moolenaar said much the same thing about tax reform at Baker College.\n\nMoolenaar said that the government should be kept within its limits, giving Americans the opportunity to create jobs.\n\n\u201cPart of that would be tax policy, under which he would pursue lowering individual and corporate rates by closing loopholes, discouraging corporations from keeping profits offshore and instead investing in the United States,\u201d the Cadillac News reported.\n\nBack in Alma, Holmes was asked what he thought about Common Core.\n\nHe said it was a program designed to help bridge the gap between the disadvantaged students from the rest and was created by school superintendents and governors.\n\n\u201cThe federal government wasn\u2019t involved,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it needs improvement.\u201d\n\nHe added that one of the ways it could be improved is to eliminate some of the tests and assessments at the beginning of the school year.\n\nHolmes was asked too, what he thinks about medical marijuana.\n\n\u201cColorado and Washington have it right,\u201d he said. \u2018Legalize it.\u201d\n\nHe told of patients that he hasn\u2019t seen in 20 years who call him telling him that their back hurts.\n\nIf marijuana helps, it helps, but without treating the patients in 20 years, he said he couldn\u2019t document how other treatments had failed and how marijuana would be beneficial.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t put me in the middle,\u201d he said.\n\nHe was also asked how he could help end the stalemate in Washington.\n\nHolmes said he would be respectful, listen and build relationships.\n\n\u201cA good idea is a good idea,\u201d no matter what side of the aisle it comes from, he said.\n\nAnd, he was asked if the mid Michigan area should be concerned about Ebola.\n\nHe said it should, since several people from the area visit Sierra Leone each year (although not since the Ebola epidemic has spread.)\n\nBut closing the borders?\n\nHe said he was reminded of Edgar Allen Poe\u2019s, \u201cThe Mask of the Red Death,\u201d in which the castle doors are closed to keep out the plague and everyone dies anyway.\n\nHe is however, in favor of screening patients who are coming from countries where Ebola is present and taking temperatures.\n\nAnd, he pointed out that a service learning program on protecting patients and hospital workers was planned for Tuesday at the Alma hospital.\n\nIn Cadillac on the topic of Ebola, the Cadillac News reported that Moolenaar told his audience that he believed travel restrictions should be enacted and travel visas from West Africa should not be granted.\n\nMoolenaar spoke on Obamacare as well.\n\nHe said the ACA makes life more difficult for lower income Americans by encouraging the cut back of full time jobs to 30 hours to avoid the requirement of paying benefits, the Cadillac News reported.\n\nMoolenaar\u2019s withdrawal from the Heritage Center debate was not taken lightly in Alma.\n\nGinna Holmes, wife of the Democratic candidate, spoke about how disappointing it was that the candidates could not debate. It is after all, she said, an important part of the political process.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sad for all of us,\u201d she said. \u201cBy not showing up, (Moolenaar) is saying that we don\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\nFor his part, Moolenaar noted in Cadillac that he had taken part in a forum Sept. 30 at Alma College and that he and Holmes had appeared together at a number of events, the Cadillac News said.\n\n\u201cIt was less important to debate Holmes a second time, Moolenaar said,\u201d the Cadillac News reported\n\nGinna Holmes also told the Alma audience that running for national office was not something decided upon only recently. Holmes had been considering a run for several years.so She said that in order to compete in this cammpaign, they were told a candidate has to raise $1.25 million.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not in that ball park,\u201d she said.\n\nAn appeal was made by the Alma Democratic students to help in Holmes\u2019 grass roots campaign.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Politics, Politics news, Mt Pleasant Politics news, MI Politics news, US Politics news, world Politics news.", "title": "A unique debate: Holmes in Alma, Moolenaar in Cadillac", "og": {"url": "http://www.themorningsun.com/article/MS/20141021/NEWS/141029953", "image": {"width": "600px", "identifier": "http://local.themorningsun.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/themorningsun.png?052016", "height": "600px"}, "type": "article", "title": "A unique debate: Holmes in Alma, Moolenaar in Cadillac"}, "twitter": {"domain": "themorningsun.com", "description": "\u200bBy Linda Gittlemanlgittleman@michigannewspapers.com", "title": "A unique debate: Holmes in Alma, Moolenaar in Cadillac", "url": "http://www.themorningsun.com/article/MS/20141021/NEWS/141029953", "image": {"src": "http://local.themorningsun.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/themorningsun.png?052016"}, "site": "@mpmorningsun", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id520224707", "iphone": "id520224707", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.morningsun"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "Politics, Politics news, Mt Pleasant Politics news, MI Politics news, US Politics news, world Politics news.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "\u200bBy Linda Gittlemanlgittleman@michigannewspapers.com"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce9a5\"", "article_summary": "Only thing was, Holmes spoke in Alma and Moolenaar spoke in Cadillac.\n\u201cIt was less important to debate Holmes a second time, Moolenaar said,\u201d the Cadillac News reportedGinna Holmes also told the Alma audience that running for national office was not something decided upon only recently.\nBack in Alma, Holmes was asked what he thought about Common Core.\nBut five days before the debate, Moolenaar withdrew and went to Cadillac for a meet and greet sponsored by the Cadillac Area Chamber of Commerce and the Northern Michigan Chamber Alliance.\n\u200bBy Linda Gittlemanlgittleman@michigannewspapers.comIn one sense, state Sen.
