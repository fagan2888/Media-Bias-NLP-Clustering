That 18-year link ended when the doctor retired, leaving her feeling alone and vulnerable once more to the disease.\n\n\u201cIf they knew your whole history, you have to start all over again. That\u2019s such a horrible process,\u201d DeAngelis said, adding that she believes her health never got back on track.\n\nBut that process of finding a new doctor \u2014 and that fear of losing an established bond with an old one \u2014 is now something that many of the well over 1.1 million HIV-positive Americans must face as they adjust to the changes brought about by the Affordable Care Act (ACA), often dubbed \u201cObamacare.\u201d\n\nMany of these patients now face changing long-term arrangements \u2014 something that they say is difficult and upsetting. But at the same time, many other sufferers, who had been ineligible for some forms of coverage or unable to pay exorbitantly high premiums in the past, will find themselves finally able to get coverage.\n\nFor both groups, navigating the complex new health care system is likely to be confusing and intimidating, even though it offers long-term gains for managing and treating their disease, many health policy analysts believe.\n\n\u201cThey may have to change hospitals, pharmacies,\u201d said Anne Donnelly, a longtime supporter of San Francisco\u2019s HIV-positive community and the director of health policy at advocacy group Project Inform. She added that for many people living for years with HIV, their medical care system had almost become a way of life. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of uncertainty. It\u2019s kind of a natural thing that people face. Anytime you have a disease like HIV, your health care is your lifeline. Anything that presents a change is going to be threatening,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "ACA could disrupt long-term medical care for HIV-positive people but ensures many will get vital help", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=810543104, affiliate-data=10lxKx", "og": {"url": "http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/2/25/a-obamacarea-createsdoubtsconcernsaandhopeaforhivsufferers.html", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/ajam/articles/2014/2/25/a-obamacarea-createsdoubtsconcernsaandhopeaforhivsufferers/jcr:content/image.img.jpg", "height": 800}, "type": "article", "description": "ACA could disrupt long-term medical care for HIV-positive people but ensures many will get vital help", "title": "\u2018Obamacare\u2019 creates doubts, concerns \u2013 \u0093and hope \u2013 for HIV sufferers"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/ajam/articles/2014/2/25/a-obamacarea-createsdoubtsconcernsaandhopeaforhivsufferers/jcr:content/image.img.jpg", "title": "\u2018Obamacare\u2019 creates doubts, concerns \u2013 \u0093and hope \u2013 for HIV sufferers", "description": "ACA could disrupt long-term medical care for HIV-positive people but ensures many will get vital help", "card": "summary", "site": "@AJAM"}, "google-play-app": "app-id=com.aljazeera.simple", "keywords": "AIDS, Obamacare, Health", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe3c17\"", "article_summary": "Anytime you have a disease like HIV, your health care is your lifeline.\nShe added that for many people living for years with HIV, their medical care system had almost become a way of life.\nFor both groups, navigating the complex new health care system is likely to be confusing and intimidating, even though it offers long-term gains for managing and treating their disease, many health policy analysts believe.\n\u201cThey may have to change hospitals, pharmacies,\u201d said Anne Donnelly, a longtime supporter of San Francisco\u2019s HIV-positive community and the director of health policy at advocacy group Project Inform.\nThat\u2019s such a horrible process,\u201d DeAngelis said, adding that she believes her health never got back on track."}
