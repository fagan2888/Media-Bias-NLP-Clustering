The second-highest was Texas with 131,757. Overall, 37 states rely on federal exchanges instead of setting up their own. Other large states like California and New York have their own exchanges.\n\nThe reasons for enrollment vary, but 78,611 enrollees \u2013 nearly half of Florida\u2019s total \u2013 signed up because they lost their health care coverage. Another 30,064 enrolled due to tax season (going without health coverage carries tax penalties stemming from the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare). And 24,188 people opted for health coverage through the exchange because they were denied Medicaid.\n\nThe federal exchanges survived a legal challenge earlier this summer when the U.S. Supreme Court declared the subsidies for plans on the exchanges were valid under Obamacare.\n\nFlorida lawmakers fought out their own battle over Obamacare this year, with House Republicans refusing to go along with Senate Republicans\u2019 plan to use federal Medicaid funds to expand health coverage to more people, despite new work and co-pay requirements.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Florida leads Obamacare enrollment", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Orlando Sentinel", "author": "Orlando Sentinel", "og": {"site_name": "OrlandoSentinel.com", "description": "TALLAHASSEE \u2013 Nearly 944,000 people signed up for health care through federal exchanges during the latest enrollment period, which ran from Feb. 23 to June 30, with the largest number coming from Florida, a ccording to data released Friday by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services.", "title": "Florida leads Obamacare enrollment", "url": "http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/politics/political-pulse/os-florida-leads-obamacare-enrollment-20150814-post.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-55ce26ce/turbine/os-florida-leads-obamacare-enrollment-20150814", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp16.17", "twitter": {"site": "@orlandosentinel", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "Obamacare, Florida, Medicaid expansion, enrollment, federal exchange", "fb": {"admins": 100004353067097, "page_id": 5779052556, "app_id": 890804050949750}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=402223551, app-argument=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/deeplinkid/84210160", "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2015-08-14", "Description": "Florida leads Obamacare enrollment", "y_key": "fb73650ad672fe45", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Obamacare, Florida, Medicaid expansion, enrollment, federal exchange"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbf3f\"", "article_summary": "The reasons for enrollment vary, but 78,611 enrollees \u2013 nearly half of Florida\u2019s total \u2013 signed up because they lost their health care coverage.\nThe federal exchanges survived a legal challenge earlier this summer when the U.S. Supreme Court declared the subsidies for plans on the exchanges were valid under Obamacare.\nAnother 30,064 enrolled due to tax season (going without health coverage carries tax penalties stemming from the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare).\nAnd 24,188 people opted for health coverage through the exchange because they were denied Medicaid.\nOverall, 37 states rely on federal exchanges instead of setting up their own."}
