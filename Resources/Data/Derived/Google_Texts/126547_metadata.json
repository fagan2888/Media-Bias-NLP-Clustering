Thursday\u2019s protests, which started with a march on McDonald\u2019s and ended in front of Alice Walton\u2019s New York condo, were organised by groups like Our Walmart, United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, New York United and Retail Action Project.\n\nWhile most of the signs asked for $15 hourly wages, there were other issues weighing on Williams\u2019s mind \u2013 like healthcare and her spotty schedule.\n\n\u201cBecause I am part-time right now, they are taking away my health benefits. I already don\u2019t get dental and now I am not going to have health insurance,\u201d she said, concerned about what this would mean come January and whether loss of insurance would translate into a penalty under the Affordable Care Act. \u201cI don\u2019t even know if I am eligible for Obamacare or anything.\u201d\n\nAt 34, she has been with Walmart for 14 years now. Even though she earns $13.71 an hour, more than most Walmart workers, she still struggles to make ends meet.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Montressia Williams isn\u2019t worried about being penalised for participating in the protests. \u2018It doesn\u2019t even matter. If it\u2019s my time to move on, it\u2019s my time to move on,\u2019 she said about the possibility of being fired.

Raising her hands to demonstrate a scale, she continued: \u201cEvery time Walmart gives me a 50-cent raise on this hand, on the other hand they take it away a different way. They are leaving me to have a paycheck that is $300 to $400 every two weeks.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cAt Walmart, it doesn\u2019t take too long to advance beyond the minimum-wage level,\u201d Kory Lundberg, a spokesman for Walmart, told the New York Times. Higher wages, however, mean little if one\u2019s hours are reduced or if they come with reduced benefits.\n\nThe goal of the march was to bring attention to the \u201cpoverty wages that low-wage workers all around the country have to endure at the hands of corporations that make billions of dollars\u201d, says Kercena Dozier, a 34-year-old community organiser for New York United.\n\nAs poor Americans continue to struggle during the sluggish recovery, protesters have taken to carrying out acts of civil disobedience like blocking streets and roads in order to get arrested. These acts, they hope, show that they are willing to do whatever it takes to move the issue forward.\n\n\u201cAll of you must have your IDs on you,\u201d an organiser told a group of protesters on Thursday as they prepared to walk off the sidewalk into the middle of a busy New York intersection. Just moments prior, those protesters emptied their pockets, leaving all of their valuables with yet another organiser. The acts of civil disobedience carried out by the protesters have been carefully planned and documented.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A protester holds a sign advocating for a $15-an-hour wage.

Even as a New York policeman proceeded to put a zip tie around one protester\u2019s hands and lead her to a van, she continued to lead everyone in a chant:\n\n\u201cWhose Walmart?\u201d she yelled.\n\n\u201cOur Walmart!\u201d the crowd yelled back.\n\n\u2018They are butchering their father\u2019s dreams\u2019\n\nOn Wednesday, for the first time in her life, Courtney Moore got on an airplane. The short flight from Ohio to New York was smooth. \u201cNo turbulence,\u201d she said, laughing.\n\nFor Moore, this trip came with a mission: to remind Alice Walton, the heir to the Walmart fortune, of her father\u2019s vision for the company.\n\n\u201cIn my Walmart, in our break room, we have a sign up from Sam Walton that says: \u2018The front end cashiers are the first face that the customers see and the last face they see when they leave the store. We are a family.\u2019 We are supposed to be treated like a family,\u201d said Moore. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think the Waltons are going to disagree with that, because I took that straight from their father\u2019s mouth. They are butchering their father\u2019s dreams.\u201d\n\nPrior to the protests, Walmart workers at 1,690 stores collected signatures from their co-workers in support of their cause. (Overall, Walmart has 4,322 stores in the US.) It was Moore\u2019s task to deliver the petition to Walton.\n\n\u201cOf course, she didn\u2019t come downstairs,\u201d said the 22-year-old Ohioan. The petition was left with the doorman, who seemed sympathetic to the workers\u2019 cause and promised to personally deliver the papers to Walton.\n\nRetailers, including Walmart, have said that they cannot afford to raise wages as it would eat away at their profits. Just this week Walmart\u2019s new CEO, Doug McMillon, expressed concerns over the company\u2019s sales, saying, \u201cThere is no excuse for us not to be doing better.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A discarded sign in front of the building where the protesters ended their march.

I am on government assistance. I am on food stamps and I have to get government housing. I should not need that if I am a Walmart employee. My baby should depend on me, and me alone, my baby should not have to depend on Obama and the government to give us what we need to survive.\u201d\n\nMoore\u2019s co-worker, 20-year old LaRanda Jackson, who earns $8.75 an hour working sales floor at Walmart, was among those arrested for civil disobedience. Altogether 26 protesters were arrested \u2013 14 workers and 12 organisers.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Organisers try to gather the signs as the protest comes to a close.

New York police continued to look on as organisers spent 10 minutes unsuccessfully trying to get the crowds to disperse.\n\n\n\nBlowing a whistle, one organiser raised his voice above the hum of the crowd, reciting a line from the song Closing Time, by Semisonic:\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to go home, but you can\u2019t stay here.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#005689", "description": "Demanding higher wages and better benefits, Walmart workers protest outside Alice Walton\u2019s home resulting in 26 arrests", "application-name": "The Guardian", "author": "Jana Kasperkevic", "og": {"site_name": "the Guardian", "description": "Demanding higher wages and better benefits, Walmart workers protest outside Alice Walton\u2019s home resulting in 26 arrests", "title": "Struggling workers take wage protest to upscale doorstep of Walmart heiress Alice Walton", "url": "http://www.theguardian.com/money/us-money-blog/2014/oct/17/walmart-workers-protest-arrests-alice-walton-home", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/17/1413551624621/ea4aef79-a740-43d7-b1f5-04fbaef9652e-2060x1236.jpeg?w=1200&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=fd7d75544a614a090d35dde5df3f9108", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "gnmguardian://money/us-money-blog/2014/oct/17/walmart-workers-protest-arrests-alice-walton-home?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/money/us-money-blog/2014/oct/17/walmart-workers-protest-arrests-alice-walton-home", "iphone": "gnmguardian://money/us-money-blog/2014/oct/17/walmart-workers-protest-arrests-alice-walton-home?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}, "id": {"ipad": 409128287, "iphone": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"ipad": "The Guardian", "googleplay": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}}, "site": "@guardian", "image": "https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/17/1413551624621/ea4aef79-a740-43d7-b1f5-04fbaef9652e-2060x1236.jpeg", "creator": "@kasperka"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Guardian", "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://money/us-money-blog/2014/oct/17/walmart-workers-protest-arrests-alice-walton-home?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "HandheldFriendly": "True", "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287}, "theme-color": "#005689", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/favicons/f06f6996e193d1ddcd614ea852322d25/windows_tile_144_b.png", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "US personal finance,Walmart,Retail industry,US income inequality,McDonald's,Food & drink industry,Business,US economy,Economics", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "published_time": "2014-10-17T16:24:12.000Z", "author": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jana-kasperkevic", "section": "Money", "modified_time": "2014-10-17T20:51:22.000Z", "tag": "US personal finance,Walmart,Retail industry,US income inequality,McDonald's,Food & drink industry,Business,US economy,Economics"}, "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/17/1413551624621/ea4aef79-a740-43d7-b1f5-04fbaef9652e-2060x1236.jpeg?w=620&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=cd592085df1c09fd983ac801e02b9a7b", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "US personal finance,Walmart,Retail industry,US income inequality,McDonald's,Food & drink industry,Business,US economy,Economics"}, "article_summary": "Even though she earns $13.71 an hour, more than most Walmart workers, she still struggles to make ends meet.\nThey are butchering their father\u2019s dreams.\u201dPrior to the protests, Walmart workers at 1,690 stores collected signatures from their co-workers in support of their cause.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Organisers try to gather the signs as the protest comes to a close.\nRetailers, including Walmart, have said that they cannot afford to raise wages as it would eat away at their profits.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A protester holds a sign advocating for a $15-an-hour wage."}
