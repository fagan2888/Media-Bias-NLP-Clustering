Here are a few of the craziest things Rafael Cruz has uttered on public stages in the last year.\n\nTexas\u2019 junior senator and 2016 presidential prospect, Ted Cruz, has made quite a conservative name for himself in a year. Just last month, he helped to engineer a government shutdown and won the far right-wing Values Voter Summit straw poll.\n\nHis father, Rafael Cruz, is just as much of a troublemaker but may turn out to be more of a hindrance than a help in the senator\u2019s presidential bid. An evangelical Texas pastor armed with an inspirational (though questioned) story of escaping Cuba\u2019s Castro regime, he often speaks to the religious and conservative base. And he doesn\u2019t shy away from the controversial.\n\nA Cruz spokesman told Mother Jones, \u201cPastor Cruz does not speak for the senator.\u201d But after hearing the elder Cruz speak earlier this year, Glenn Beck said, \u201cIt\u2019s easy to see that the fruit doesn\u2019t fall far from the tree in the Cruz household.\u201d\n\nBased on Pastor Cruz\u2019s words, that fruit is bitter. In the last year, Rafael Cruz has given dozens of speeches and interviews that make some far out, often offensive assertions. The Daily Beast collected some of his craziest quotes and sentiments.\n\nClaim: Marxist Obama should go \u201cback to Kenya.\u201d\n\nSeptember 12, 2012\n\nNorth Texas Tea Party Meeting\n\nRafael Cruz had a birther moment last year at a gathering of Texas Tea Partiers. \u201cWe have our work cut out for us,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to send Barack Obama back to Chicago. I\u2019d like to send him back to Kenya, back to Indonesia.\u201d He went on to say, \u201cWe have to unmask this man. This is a man that seeks to destroy all concept of God. And I will tell you what, this is classical Marxist philosophy. Karl Marx very clearly said Marxism requires that we destroy God because government must become God.\u201d\n\nClaim: The government is going to take all of your money and Obama has no problem with murder.\n\nApril 25, 2013\n\nHood County, Texas\n\nIn a speech before the local Tea Party, Cruz likened the United States under President Obama to Cuba under Castro, warned that the Obamacare \u201cdeath panels\u201d are coming, and said the government, which he called a \u201cwicked rule,\u201d wants to confiscate \u201cour fortunes.\u201d\n\nCruz went on to lie about Obama\u2019s record on abortion. \u201cDo you realize,\u201d he asked a room of conservatives, \u201cthe first bill President Obama signed into law was to legalize third trimester abortions?\u201d Then, referring to Kermit Gosnell, the abortion provider convicted of murdering babies this year, Cruz said, Obama \u201cprobably doesn\u2019t have any problem with what this butcher in Philadelphia is doing.\u201d\n\nClaim: Barack Obama is just like Fidel Castro.\n\nJuly 5, 2013\n\nFreedomWorks\u2019 Free the People Event, Salt Lake City, Utah\n\nIn his State of the Union address, Obama said that if Congress refused to act on climate change, he would \u201cdirect my Cabinet to come up with executive actions we can take, now and in the future, to reduce pollution, prepare our communities for the consequences of climate change, and speed the transition to more sustainable sources of energy.\u201d These words, Cruz said, are \u201cthe most ominous words I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d Over shouts of \u201cTyranny!\u201d Cruz said, \u201cNot much different than that old bearded friend that I left behind in Cuba, governing by decree, by executive order, just like a dictator, like Fidel Castro.\u201d\n\nClaim: The media is evil and wants to destroy this country.\n\nOctober 17, 2013\n\nInterview with Glenn Beck\n\nRafael Cruz told Glenn Beck that the U.S. has its very own \u201cministry of misinformation\u201d that governments in communist countries like Cuba employ to spread their messages. That propaganda machine, he said, is the liberal media. \u201cThey just tell us what they want us to hear. They are rewriting history\u2026because they have an agenda. And unfortunately the agenda is an evil agenda. It\u2019s an agenda for destroying what this country is all about,\u201d he said.\n\nClaim: Gay marriage is a government conspiracy.\n\nAugust 10, 2013\n\nFamily Leadership Summit in Ames, Iowa\n\nGay marriage, Cruz asserts, is a government plot to destroy the family and institute its socialist agenda. \u201cSocialism requires that government becomes your god. That\u2019s why they have to destroy the concept of God. They have to destroy all loyalties except loyalty to the government. That\u2019s what\u2019s behind homosexual marriage. It\u2019s really more about the destruction of the traditional family than about exalting homosexuality, because you need to destroy, also, loyalty to the family.\u201d\n\nClaim: Our enemies control our energy.\n\nOctober 19, 2012\n\nGrassroots America We the People (GAWTP), Tyler, Texas", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "BrandyZadrozny"}, "keywords": "Ted Cruz, u.s. poli", "publicationDate": 201311071045, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "description": "Ted Cruz is known as a right-wing troublemaker, but he is tame compared to his dad.
