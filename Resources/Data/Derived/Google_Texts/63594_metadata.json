Burwell, an Affordable Care Act (ACA) challenge set for argument on March 26. The brief asks the Court to affirm Court of Appeals\u2019 decisions upholding the federal policy of maintaining access to free preventive care, including contraceptive services, in employer-sponsored health plans.\n\nCurrently, federal law allows employers to \u201copt-out\u201d of financing access to no cost contraceptive services, provided the employers furnish notice to the government so that alternate financing can be arranged for their employees. The challengers in this case seek to foreclose this alternative access for their employees, which would force employees to pay out of pocket for contraceptive services.\n\nThe brief warns that if the Court grants a contraceptive services exception, \u201c[r]eligious employers will continue to \u2018edit\u2019 the mandated package of preventive services, and chip away at other coverage of these conditions.\u201d The Center said it has already received reports of employers using religious objections to avoid covering HIV medications on the health plans they offer employees.\n\nTwenty-six non-profit organizations signed onto the brief, including many health care access and HIV advocacy organizations. The signatories say this case is about more than just access to contraception. By creating a precedent that allows for a contraceptive services exception, the brief argues, the Court could create a scenario that motivates other religious employers to try to block no cost access to a broad range of preventive care services, including screening for HIV, HCV, and depression; substance abuse counseling; and vaccinations, such as flu shots. The brief also argues that a contraceptive services exception would prevent women from being able to control their fertility in the face of public health emergencies, such as the Zika virus epidemic.\n\nAccording to the brief, religious employers may similarly object to other services offered in the mandatory package of no cost preventive care. HCV, similar to HIV, is identified with stigmatized behavior, including intravenous drug use and sexual activity that is disapproved by a variety of religious organizations. Depression is often treated with anti-depressants and other psychiatric drugs. Certain religions such as Scientology, however, consider these treatments anathema. Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, Christian Scientists, and some churches that believe in faith healing have sincere religious objections to vaccinations, including flu vaccinations.\n\n\u201cPreventing religious employers from making health care access decisions for their employees is critical to ensuring that the ACA will carry out its intended goals and that the health of employees remains our top concern,\u201d said Robert Greenwald, clinical professor of law and faculty director of CHLPI. \u201cThis is particularly important as we work to create a health system that focuses on prevention and early intervention health care that both improves public health and health outcomes and reduces costs.\u201d\n\nThe brief discusses the low levels of preventive care prior to the ACA and explains how the financial barriers to these services resulted in Americans not getting the care they needed. The brief then argues the importance of mandating no cost access to a standardized package of preventive services in employer-sponsored health plans. The majority of non-elderly Americans receive their health care through employer-sponsored health plans.\n\nCarmel Shachar \u201910, a CHLPI clinical instructor notes, \u201cIf the Supreme Court finds for the employers bringing this case, Americans\u2019 ability to access no cost preventive services and make the health choices that are right for them could be seriously impaired. We would also lose a valuable tool for improving overall public health and being able to respond to serious public health crises, such as Zika virus or swine flu.\u201d\n\nThe amicus brief was prepared by staff and students at the Harvard Law School Center for Health Law and Policy Innovation.\n\nLauren Kuhlik \u201917 said the brief was designed to remind the Court that their decision could impact more than just an individual\u2019s ability to make their own reproductive choices. \u201cThe United States has a historically low rate of consistent contraceptive use, and only comprehensive preventive coverage can address this public health issue,\u201d Kuhlik said. \u201cWe also wanted to bring to the Court\u2019s attention that their decision could limit employees\u2019 access to other potentially controversial preventive services, such as HIV and hepatitis C screenings.\u201d\n\nKelly Jo Popkin \u201917 said: \u201cWorking on this brief gave me insight into the role that amicus curiae briefs can play in influencing court decisions. Writing an amicus brief is different from writing a party brief because you are trying to make sure that you are representing your client\u2019s unique perspective. In this case, we focused on the concerns of health care access, HIV, and hepatitis C advocates.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#fff", "description": "Harvard Law School\u2019s Center for Health Law and Policy Innovation (CHLPI) filed an amicus brief to the U.S. Supreme Court in <em>Zubik v.
