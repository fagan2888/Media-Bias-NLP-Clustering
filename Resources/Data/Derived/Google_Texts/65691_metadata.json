Ted Poe delaying its rollout.\n\n\u201cWe support Rep. Poe\u2019s bill,\u201d he said. \u201cWe strongly support that.\u201d\n\nInstead, Stack said the United States should wait to change its diagnostic medical coding system until the implementation of ICD-11, Stack said.\n\n[Also: ICD-10 bill surfaces, calls for delay]\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s just get to ICD-11 and get it done properly,\u201d he said on Friday in an interview with Healthcare Finance.\n\n\u201cWe believe the problems associated with ICD-10 are so substantial, our policy is we should not move forward with ICD-10.\u201d\n\nThe World Health Organization is expected to have an initial draft of ICD-11 ready by 2017.\n\nPoe\u2019s bill, largely seen as a longshot to ever pass, would prohibit the Secretary of Health and Human Services from replacing ICD-9 with ICD-10 on Oct. 1, as is scheduled.\n\nThe \u201cCutting Costly Codes Act of 2015\u201d asks instead for a study to identify steps that can be taken to mitigate the disruption ICD-10 would have on healthcare providers.\n\n\u201cVery clearly, the current policy of the federal government is ICD-10 will be implemented Oct. 1 2015. All sorts of other stakeholders have said \u2018let\u2019s do it,\u2019\u201d Stack said. \u201cIf Health and Human Services moves forward and implements, then we say, there should be a period in which providers should be held harmless.\u201d\n\nStack was referring to bill H.R. 2247 filed Wednesday by Rep. Diane Black, R-Tenn., asking for a transition period in which the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid would accept dual coding under ICD-9 and ICD-10 after the Oct. 1 rollout.\n\n[Also: New ICD-10 bill asks for transition period, but not a delay]\n\nLegislative tracker GovTrack gives Black\u2019s bill a 7 percent chance of moving forward.\n\nStack, who takes over as AMA president on June 9, said there\u2019s still time to increase the odds.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an eternity between now and October in legislative parlance,\u201d he said.\n\nThe AMA has long been against ICD-10, that is in use worldwide. The United States is among the few, if not the only, country, to use the codes to determine reimbursement to physicians and providers.\n\n\u201cThe rest of the world has been on a different variation of ICD-10,\u201d Stack said. \u201cEach nation modifies it at the national level. It is fruits to vegetables.\u201d For instance, he said, Canada has about 17,000 codes under ICD-10, about the same number in the U.S. under ICD-9.\n\nICD-10 would increase the number of codes in this country to about 68,000.\n\nUnder ICD-9, there are 16 codes to diagnose a broken femur compared to 750 ways under ICD-10, Stack said.\n\n\u201cThere are many instances we don\u2019t know that level of detail,\u201d he said. \u201cICD-10 is problematic, it requires a level of specificity and precision clinicians say we don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to be able to provide.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the copy of a letter the AMA sent this week to Rep. Poe, announcing their support.\n\nTwitter: @SusanMorseHFN", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/ama-chief-throws-support-behind-bill-delay-icd-10-says-us-should-wait-icd-11", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/fast-forward-button-feature.gif", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "Steven Stack, the incoming president of the American Medical Association, says problems with ICD-10 for physicians are too big to allow it to move forward.", "title": "AMA chief throws support behind bill to delay ICD-10, says US should wait for ICD-11"}, "twitter": {"site": "@HC_Finance", "image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/fast-forward-button-feature.gif"}, "description": "Steven Stack, the incoming president of the American Medical Association, says problems with ICD-10 for physicians are too big to allow it to move forward.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "AMA chief throws support behind bill to delay ICD-10, says US should wait for ICD-11"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "ICD-10 should not only be delayed, but scrapped, said Steven Stack, the incoming president of the American Medical Association, throwing his organization\u2019s support behind a bill by Texas Republican Rep.
