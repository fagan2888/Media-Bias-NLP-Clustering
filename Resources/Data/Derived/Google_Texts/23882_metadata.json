Reuters\n\nIn one of the biggest upsets of the Games so far, Norwegian women failed to medal in the 20 kilometer cross-country relay.\n\nSweden took the gold by a half-second over Finland, followed by Germany, which was .9 seconds behind the Swedes. Norway was the defending champion in the race. The Norwegians had won 10 consecutive women's relay races at World Cup and World Championship competitions since 2010. However, Norway appeared to have chosen the wrong wax for the wet and wax conditions. Their team was 13 seconds back at the 7.5 kilometer mark and never challenged. Norway finished in fifth place, 53.6 seconds back.\n\nComing on the heels of Norway's failure to win any medals in cross-country and biathlon Saturday, Norway is likely to enter crisis mode after the women's relay debacle.\n\nThe U.S. team featuring world champion Kikkan Randall finished 9th, two and a half minutes back. Randall struggled on the opening leg skiing the classic style. She was nearly 40 seconds behind at the first exchange. It now appears that the U.S. medal drought in cross-country will stretch into a fifth decade. Team USA last won a cross-country medal in 1976.\n\n\"I don't know why I didn't do too well, said Heidi Weng, who skied the opening leg for Norway. \"I'm not sure it was the skis or something else.\"\n\nRandall, who failed to make the semifinal of her signature sprint Tuesday, said something isn't quite right with her. \"I need to figure out what it is,\" she said.\n\nWrite to Matthew Futterman at matthew.futterman@wsj.com", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "article.created": "2014-02-15T11:45:00.000Z", "article.section": "Sports", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "Article", "twitter": {"domain": "wsj.com", "description": "In one of the biggest upsets of the Sochi Winter Olympic Games so far, Norwegian women failed to medal in the 20 kilometer cross-country relay.
