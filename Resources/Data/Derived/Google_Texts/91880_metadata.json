The impact of counterfeiting is greater for rich countries - where most of the companies making the highly desirable branded goods are based - with the European Union importing up to 5 percent of fakes in 2013, or as much as $116 billion. The Paris-based think-tank said China appeared as the largest producer of counterfeited products, but that the intellectual property rights of Chinese companies had also been frequently infringed. The OECD cited the post-financial crisis revival in trade, the emergence of globalized value chains and booming e-commerce as reasons for the rise in pirated goods trade since 2008.
