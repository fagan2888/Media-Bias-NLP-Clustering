Shelley Moore Capito returns to Washington, it will be with a new title: senator-elect.\n\nThe seven-term Republican congresswoman\u2019s landslide victory over Democrat Natalie Tennant led a Republican sweep of House and Senate races in West Virginia.\n\nThe results send a \u201cloud and clear\u201d message that President Barack Obama\u2019s \u201cfailed agenda doesn\u2019t work for West Virginia,\u201d Ms. Capito told supporters at her victory party Tuesday night.\n\nThe win makes Ms. Capito the first woman to represent the state in the U.S. Senate. She\u2019ll also be the first Republican to represent West Virginia in the Senate since 1958.\n\n\u201cThis election marks a true turning point in our state\u2019s history,\u201d Ms. Capito said.\n\nRepublicans also swept West Virginia\u2019s three U.S. House races. Republican Rep. David McKinley easily survived a challenge from Democrat Auditor General Glen Gainer, but Democratic U.S. Rep. Nick Rahall couldn\u2019t hold off state Sen. Evan Jenkins. Meanwhile, former Maryland state Sen. Alex Mooney beat former state Democratic chairman Nick Casey in an open race to fill Ms. Capito\u2019s House seat.\n\nThe campaign of Ms. Tenant, who is West Virginia\u2019s secretary of state, was not enough to keep Sen. Jay Rockefeller\u2019s seat in Democratic hands. She lost to a better known candidate who took a calculated risk by giving up her House seat to run for the upper chamber. The risk paid off.\n\nMs. Capito dominated the field all cycle, according to political polls. True to predictions, on Tuesday she handily defeated Ms. Tennant along with Libertarian John S. Buckley, who came in a very distant third; Mountain Party candidate Bob Henry Baber who came in fourth, and Constitution Party candidate Phil Hudok who came in fifth.\n\n\u201cIt was a Republican year, and Capito ran a stronger campaign, a bit more well-defined campaign,\u201d said Neil Burch, associate professor of political science at West Virginia University.\n\nThe GOP\u2019s incessant messaging about the administration\u2019s anti-coal policies helped Ms. Capito in a state where mining is part of the economy, the culture and local lore. So did funding from the mining, oil and gas industries, which pumped more than $500,000 into her campaign, helping her to spend $7.3 million, more than twice as much as Ms. Tennant.\n\nThe defeat of Mr. Rahall, ranking Democrat on the powerful House Transportation Committee, leaves West Virginia with no representation in congressional leadership. That\u2019s an unaccustomed position for a state whose delegates not so long ago presided over the Senate, ran its Appropriations Committee and held the ranking minority seat on the House Ethics Committee.\n\nSome attribute Mr. Rahall\u2019s showing to anti-Obama sentiment that prevailed in West Virginia, even as a disproportionate number of state residents benefit from the Affordable Care Act, the president\u2019s signature domestic policy and a target of Republican critics.\n\nMr. Jenkins is a former Democrat who changed his party affiliation last year. During the campaign he pledged to be a thorn in the president\u2019s side by working to repeal the Affordable Care Act and to oppose the administration\u2019s environmental regulations that affect the coal industry.\n\nMr. McKinley easily survived a challenge from Mr. Gainer, an accountant, who spent election season criticizing the incumbent\u2019s support of his party\u2019s relentless efforts to repeal Affordable Care Act.\n\nMr. McKinley, a businessman who founded an architectural engineering firm, campaigned on a promise to help the coal industry stave off Democrats\u2019 efforts to reduce carbon emissions. He also said he would work to protect Medicaid and Social Security, to create jobs and to help veterans access the benefits they deserve.\n\nMr. Casey and Mr. Mooney were evenly matched fund-raisers, each bringing in about $1.7 million, but Mr. Mooney was better able to convert those dollars to votes. He peppered the airwaves with ads promoting himself as pro-life, pro-gun and pro-coal and promising to stand up to Mr. Obama.\n\nHe carried that message through his victory night speech.\n\n\u201cWe West Virginians are fighting back,\u201d Mr. Mooney said late Tuesday. \u201cPresident Obama \u2013 I hope you are listening \u2013 because tonight, West Virginia has sent a message to you and your administration.\u201d\n\nWashington Bureau Chief Tracie Mauriello: tmauriello@post-gazette.com, 703-996-9292 or on Twitter @pgPoliTweets.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ms. Capito is a moderate Republican, an opponent of the Affordable Care Act and a staunch defender of the coal industry.", "og": {"site_name": "Pittsburgh Post-Gazette", "description": "When U.S. Rep.
