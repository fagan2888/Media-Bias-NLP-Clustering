Companies with fewer than 50 employees are exempt from taxes for failing to provide medical coverage, while companies with fewer than 25 full-time workers can qualify for tax credits.\n\n\u201cThe anti-competitive effects of the ACA will be most dramatic in lower paid industries. The building and construction trades also will be particularly hard hit,\u201d said Rubbelke. \u201cEach employer, under the ACA, will be able to do an individual calculus regarding providing coverage (or not) for their workforce.\u201d\n\nThe impact on workers and their families will vary depending on their fund and union. Longer term, the ACA could threaten the very viability of Taft-Hartley plans and undermine one of the biggest advantages labor unions have to offer their members \u2014 high quality health care coverage.\n\nMeantime, there\u2019s no quick cure for what ails multi-employer medical plans. \u201cTo create a different result, statutory change would be necessary, which will not happen in a deadlocked Congress,\u201d Rubbelke said.\n\nContact Tom Steward at tsteward@watchdog.org", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "The Affordable Care Act threatens the quality of health coverage and employment opportunities for 187,000 union workers and their dependents, a top official of a Twin Cities-based multi-employer union medical plan says.", "title": "Jobs, coverage at risk with Obamacare, MN union health official says - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/04/obamacare-impact-820x485.jpg", "updated_time": "2013-10-17T11:39:21+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/108518/jobs-coverage-at-risk-with-obamacare-mn-union-health-official-says/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Health Care", "tag": "ACA,Affordable Care Act,Doug Rubbelke,Labor Management Health Care Coalition of the Upper Midwest,LMHCC,National Labor Alliance of Health Care Coalitions,Taft-Hartley Funds,waiver", "published_time": "2013-10-02T04:00:40+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-10-17T11:39:21+00:00"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "The Affordable Care Act threatens the quality of health coverage and employment opportunities for 187,000 union workers and their dependents, a top official of a Twin Cities-based multi-employer union medical plan says.", "title": "Jobs, coverage at risk with Obamacare, MN union health official says - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/10/Dougs_photo-e1380651664865.jpg"}, "creator": "@watchdogorg", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2761\"", "article_summary": "By Tom Steward | Watchdog Minnesota BureauTWIN CITIES \u2014 The Affordable Care Act threatens the quality of health coverage and employment opportunities for 187,000 union workers and their dependents, a top official of a Twin Cities-based multi-employer union medical plan says.\nAfter health-care reform passed in 2010, hundreds of union health plans received federal waivers to cushion the impact of the first round of changes under the Affordable Care Act, including Roofers Local No.\nLonger term, the ACA could threaten the very viability of Taft-Hartley plans and undermine one of the biggest advantages labor unions have to offer their members \u2014 high quality health care coverage.\n96 \u2014 2,838 members \u2014 the Carpenter and Joiners Welfare Fund \u2014 21,364 members \u2014 and other LMHCC members in Minnesota and neighboring states.\nBut the Obama administration turned down labor\u2019s last-ditch appeal to allow subsidies for the 20 million union members covered by multi-employer plans, even if they apply to their state insurance exchange."}
