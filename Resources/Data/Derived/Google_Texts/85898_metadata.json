I love my country, but I really don\u2019t like the Fourth of July.\n\nSure, I enjoy beer, hot dogs and fireworks as much as the next guy. But a holiday that used to commemorate our ongoing quest for freedom has become a banal exercise in gluttony and self-congratulation. For the first half of our history, July 4 called us to fulfill our national destiny. Now, for the most part, it calls us to dinner.\n\nRemember, our country was founded on a radical premise: that all men are created equal. In the 1800s, then, the Fourth of July wasn\u2019t just a day to celebrate \u201cliberty.\u201d It was also a time to demand it.\n\nStart with black Americans, who used the occasion to underscore the contradiction between the country\u2019s principles and practices. \u201cWhat, to the American slave, is your Fourth of July?\u201d asked abolitionist Frederick Douglass, in his famous address in Rochester, New York, on July 4, 1852. \u201cI answer: a day that reveals to him, more than all other days in the year, the gross injustice and cruelty to which he is the constant victim.\u201d\n\nTo slaves, Douglass continued, \u201cyour celebration is a sham; your boasted liberty an unholy license; your national greatness swelling vanity; your sounds of rejoicing are empty and heartless; your denunciation of tyrants brass-fronted impudence; your shouts of liberty and equality hollow mockery.\u201d\n\nTwo years later, a Mahican Indian chose another Empire State location for his own Fourth of July speech. \u201cWhile rejoicings to-day are commemorative of the free birth of the giant nation,\u201d John Wannuaucon Quinney told an audience in Reidsville, New York, \u201cthey simply convey to my mind, the recollection of a transfer of the miserable weakness and dependence of my race from one great power to another.\u201d\n\nLikewise, Susan B. Anthony and other feminist pioneers marked the Fourth of July with rallies for their own rights. So did the country\u2019s burgeoning class of factory workers. Textile laborers in New England called for a general strike on July 4, 1846, which they labeled \u201ca second Independence Day.\u201d\n\nA half-century later, when federal troops broke the Pullman railroad strike, labor leaders in San Francisco refused to participate in the city\u2019s official July 4 celebrations. \u201cThe Glorious Fourth! Hurrah! Fire off your guns and crackers,\u201d a longshoreman\u2019s magazine wrote, in a satirical vein. \u201cToot your horns, wave your flags, yell \u2026 What about the strike on the railroads? Hush! That\u2019s anarchy.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Fourth once reminded us to ensure that all men are created equal.
