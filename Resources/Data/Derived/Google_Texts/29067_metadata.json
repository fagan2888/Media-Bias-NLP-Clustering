Augustin, Kyle Singler and two draft picks to get Jackson from Oklahoma City, was a little worried while watching his new point guard.\n\n\u201cHe got himself really hyped up to be out there,\u201d Van Gundy said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if anyone noticed, but the first time we took him out of the game, he threw up on the bench.\n\n\u201cOnce he got calmed down in the second half, he looked like the player we traded for.\u201d\n\nMarcin Gortat had 24 points and 10 rebounds for the Wizards, who have dropped both of their games since returning from the all-star break. John Wall finished with 10 points and 12 assists, but Washington was outscored 59-37 in the second half.\n\n\u201cWe played the last couple of quarters like it was a pickup game,\u201d Washington coach Randy Wittman said. \u201cIt\u2019s a snowball effect. It is the little things that add up to big things, and they continue to get bigger and bigger as we speak.\u201d\n\nJackson got a lot of help, as Kentavious Caldwell-Pope had 26 points and Andre Drummond and Greg Monroe added their usual double-doubles.\n\n\u201cWashington\u2019s a really good team, and the only way we are going to win games like that is by getting a good effort from a lot of guys,\u201d Van Gundy said. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what we got.\u201d\n\nThe Pistons are 2-0 since Van Gundy traded four players to get Jackson and Tayshaun Prince at the deadline, even though the new roster hasn\u2019t even practiced together.\n\n\u201cThis group has been fantastic,\u201d Van Gundy said. \u201cThey were 5-23 at Christmas, and I don\u2019t know how many teams would have kept it together at that point. Since then, we keep making changes, and they keep figuring it out, and now we\u2019re in the playoff race.\u201d\n\nJackson drew a cheer from the crowd when he hit a pair of free throws late in the first half, then hit a 3-pointer to pull the Pistons to 52-47 at the half.\n\n\u201cOnce I got those free throws, I was fine,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cI just needed something to go into the basket.\u201d\n\nKris Humphries and Gortat combined for 26 first-half points, making all 13 of their shots.\n\nThe Wizards, though, didn\u2019t make a 3-pointer in the half while Detroit went 6-for-14. Things changed in the third, with Jackson hitting four shots while Gortat went 2-for-7. One of Gortat\u2019s misses came when Drummond cleanly blocked a dunk attempt, bringing the fans to their feet.\n\nCaldwell-Pope kept the crowd enthused, scoring 13 points in the period to give the Pistons a 82-71 lead heading into the fourth. Jodie Meeks started the final period with a 3-pointer to make it a 14-point game, and the Wizards never seriously threatened.\n\nWhile Gortat and Humphries were dominant early, they didn\u2019t get much help inside. Washington\u2019s starting forwards, Paul Pierce and Nene, combined to go 2 -for-13 in the first three quarters.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Andre Drummond added 18 points and 16 rebounds and the new-look Pistons beat the Wizards, 106-89, on Sunday.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Andre Drummond added 18 points and 16 rebounds and the new-look Pistons beat the Wizards, 106-89, on Sunday.", "title": "Kentavious Caldwell-Pope\u2019s 26 points push new-look Pistons past Wizards", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/feb/22/kentavious-caldwell-popes-26-points-push-new-look-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/22/APTOPIX_Wizards_Pistons_Basketball.JPEG-09f71.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/22/APTOPIX_Wizards_Pistons_Basketball.JPEG-09f71.jpg", "description": "Andre Drummond added 18 points and 16 rebounds and the new-look Pistons beat the Wizards, 106-89, on Sunday.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Kentavious Caldwell-Pope\u2019s 26 points push new-look Pistons past"}, "Author": "Dave Hogg", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Reggie Jackson, Detroit Pistons, Washington Wizards, Marcin Gortat"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9723\"", "article_summary": "\u201cHe got himself really hyped up to be out there,\u201d Van Gundy said.\n\u201cThis group has been fantastic,\u201d Van Gundy said.\n\u201cThey all talked to me at halftime and told me to relax and keep playing, and I was finally able to do that.\u201dStan Van Gundy, who had traded D.J.\nJackson turned himself into a nervous wreck and missed his first eight shots before recovering in the second half to lead the Pistons to a 106-89 victory over the Washington Wizards.\n\u201cWashington\u2019s a really good team, and the only way we are going to win games like that is by getting a good effort from a lot of guys,\u201d Van Gundy said."}
