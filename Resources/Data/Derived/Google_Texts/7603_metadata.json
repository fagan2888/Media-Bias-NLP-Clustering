The billionaire political industrialist Charles Koch has warned that Trump\u2019s proposed registry of Muslims in the U.S. would \u201cdestroy our free society.\u201d After pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into promoting their right-wing libertarian views over the past four decades, and budgeting some eight hundred and eighty-nine million dollars to spend in the 2016 election cycle, he and his brother David Koch, and their donor circle, are apparently disappointed that they have bought so little control over the Republican Presidential candidates. \u201cYou\u2019d think we could have more influence,\u201d he lamented to the Financial Times. But, in fact, the influence of the Kochs and their fellow big donors is manifest in Trump\u2019s use of incendiary and irresponsibly divisive rhetoric. Only a few years ago, it was they who were sponsoring the hate.\n\nOver the July 4th weekend of 2010, I attended the fourth annual Defending the American Dream Summit, in Austin, Texas, which served in part as a training session for local Tea Party activists. The summit was sponsored by Americans for Prosperity, which purported to be a nonpartisan grass-roots political-advocacy group devoted to the cause of small government, free markets, and liberty. It was in fact an organization that had been founded and heavily funded by the Kochs, whose early activism was entwined in fearmongering and racial intolerance.\n\nThe Kochs\u2019 father, Fred Koch, the founder of Koch Industries, the hugely profitable private oil-and-chemical company that his sons inherited, was one of the original members of the John Birch Society, the ultra-conservative group that accused political opponents of treason and was at its core segregationist. After the Supreme Court ruled in favor of desegregating America\u2019s public schools, in 1954, the Birchers launched a nationwide crusade to impeach Chief Justice Earl Warren. In 1960, Fred Koch wrote a self-published book describing welfare programs as a secret government plot to lure rural blacks into cities so that they could foment \u201ca vicious race war.\u201d Before George Wallace declared his Presidential candidacy in 1968, Fred Koch also supported an unsuccessful effort to recruit Ezra Taft Benson, the former Secretary of Agriculture and a leader of the Mormon Church, and Strom Thurmond, the South Carolina senator, to run on a platform calling for the restoration of segregation. The Birchers\u2019 radicalism was so extreme, and delusional, they claimed that Republican President Dwight Eisenhower was a communist agent.\n\nIt\u2019s not fair to visit the sins of the father on the sons, but Charles and David have their own dubious record of involvement with racist institutions. They themselves belonged to the John Birch Society, and, in the late sixties, Charles was a trustee at a place called the Freedom School, outside Colorado Springs, which had no black students because, its director explained to the Times, \u201cit might present a housing problem because some of his students are segregationists.\u201d The Freedom School was a font of extreme anti-government ideology, teaching a revisionist version of American history in which it was argued that the Civil War should not have been fought, the South should have been allowed to secede, and slavery was a lesser evil than military conscription. Charles Koch was so enthralled with the Freedom School that he got his three brothers and many friends to attend. He had hoped to expand it into an accredited university, but instead it ran aground financially. It was, however, the first step in the Kochs\u2019 lifelong crusade to use their vast fortune to reshape American academia and politics along the lines of their own ideology.\n\nThat was long ago, and, of course, many people\u2019s views on race have evolved during the decades since. In more recent years, the Kochs have made large donations to the United Negro College Fund. But, in a 2011 interview with The Weekly Standard, David Koch echoed specious claims, made by conservative gadfly Dinesh D\u2019Souza, that Obama was somehow African rather than American in his outlook. He claimed that Obama, who was born in America and abandoned by his Kenyan father as a toddler, nonetheless derived his \u201cradical\u201d views from his African heritage. \u201cHis father was a hard core economic socialist in Kenya,\u201d Koch said. \u201cObama didn\u2019t really interact with his father face-to-face very much, but was apparently from what I read a great admirer of his father\u2019s points of view. So he had sort of antibusiness, anti-free-enterprise influences affecting him almost all his life.\u201d In Koch\u2019s view, Obama \u201cjust shows you what a person with a silver tongue can achieve.\u201d\n\nThe effort to attack Obama, not as a legitimate and democratically elected American political opponent but as an alien threat to the country\u2019s survival, was very much in evidence at the Defending the American Dream Summit in Austin during the summer of 2010. Peggy Venable, who was then the director of the Texas branch of Americans for Prosperity, and who has been on the payroll of various Koch-run groups since 1994, presided over the summit. There the Texas branch gave out its Blogger of the Year award to a woman named Sibyl West, whose work described Obama as the \u201ccokehead-in-chief\u201d and as suffering from \u201cdemonic possession (aka schizophrenia, etc.).\u201d The Republican donor class may now disown vile language, but six years ago they were honoring it with trophies.\n\nThe luncheon speaker at the summit was Ted Cruz, who was formerly the solicitor general of Texas. The Kochs may now be dismayed at Trump\u2019s rhetoric, but, at the time, no one objected when Cruz said that Harvard Law School, which he and Obama both attended, had been infiltrated by communists. \u201cThere were fewer declared Republicans in the faculty when we were there than communists,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cThere was one Republican. But there were twelve who would say they were Marxists who believed in the communists overthrowing the United States government.\u201d Obama, Cruz said, \u201cwould have made the perfect president of Harvard Law School.\u201d He continued, \u201cHe\u2019s a true believer. He\u2019s committed to taking over our economy and our lives.\u201d\n\nThe same incendiary style characterized the big donors\u2019 fight against the Affordable Care Act. Rather than respectfully debating Obama\u2019s health-care plan as a policy issue, the Kochs and their allied donors poured cash into a dark-money group called the Center to Protect Patient Rights, which mounted a guerrilla war of fearmongering and vitriol. Television ads sponsored by the group featured the claim that Obama\u2019s plan was \u201ca government takeover\u201d of health care, which PolitiFact named \u201cthe lie of the year\u201d in 2010. Meanwhile, Americans for Prosperity spun off a group called Patients United Now, which organized some three hundred anti-Obamacare rallies across the country, including one where protestors unfurled a banner depicting corpses from Dachau, implying that Obama\u2019s policies would result in mass murder. At another Patients United Now rally, a Democratic congressman was hanged in effigy. Traditional town-hall meetings, at which local congressmen met with their constituents, were overtaken by angry mobs. Sean Noble, a Republican political operative who was on contract to the Kochs, later acknowledged, \u201cWe packed these town halls with people who were just screaming about this thing.\u201d As he told National Review in 2014, \u201cWe knew we had to make that summer absolute hell.\u201d\n\nAt one \u201cKill the Bill\u201d protest on Capitol Hill, Tim Phillips, the head of Americans for Prosperity, accused Obama of \u201ctrying to cram this two-thousand-page bill down the throat of the American people.\u201d Days later, at a second Capitol Hill rally, riled-up crowds spat on a passing Democratic congressman; mocked Barney Frank, the gay congressman from Massachusetts, as a \u201cfaggot\u201d; and shouted racist epithets at three black congressmen, John Lewis, Emanuel Cleaver, and Jim Clyburn.\n\nIf the big donors in the Republican Party are now recognizing that such discourse isn\u2019t just ugly but also potentially dangerous, as the outbursts of violence at Trump\u2019s rallies demonstrate, then that\u2019s a welcome change. But for the same donors who poured gasoline on the flames, when the winds were blowing the way they wanted, to now complain that Trump\u2019s campaign is out of control is, well, for want of another word, rich.", "article_metadata": {"cache-version": 20160526204643, "description": "Jane Mayer on the Koch brothers\u2019 surprising disapproval of\u00a0Donald Trump, and their own\u00a0history of toxic rhetoric.", "account-url": "https://account.newyorker.com", "wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "og": {"site_name": "The New Yorker", "description": "The Republican donor class may disown Trump\u2019s vile language, but six years ago it was honoring such toxic rhetoric with trophies.", "title": "Who Sponsored the Hate? - The New Yorker", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.newyorker.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Mayer-Who-Sponsored-the-Hate-1200x630-1458079129.jpg", "height": 630}, "url": "http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/who-sponsored-the-hate", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Republican donor class may disown Trump\u2019s vile language, but six years ago it was honoring such toxic rhetoric with trophies.", "creator": "@newyorker", "image": "http://www.newyorker.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Mayer-Who-Sponsored-the-Hate-1200x630-1458079129.jpg", "title": "Who Sponsored the Hate? - The New Yorker", "site": "@newyorker", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The New Yorker", "robots": "noodp", "parsely-metadata": "{\"id\":\"3178929\",\"title_alt\":\"Who Sponsored the Hate?\",\"featured_image_url\":\"http:\\/\\/www.newyorker.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2016\\/03\\/Mayer-Who-Sponsored-the-Hate-728-375.jpg\"}", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "environment": "prod", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1081530898", "fb": {"admins": 757909316}, "article": {"section": "News Desk", "tag": "Republican Party", "published_time": "2016-03-15T18:17:15-04:00"}, "google-site-verification": "_jvLA9pRQom0-f6587wRKrNwfRtqyKzjfYWvwcZ5fxc", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "id": 3178929, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0", "news_keywords": "2016 election, Donald Trump, Koch Brothers, Presidential Candidates, Republican Party"}, "article_summary": "The summit was sponsored by Americans for Prosperity, which purported to be a nonpartisan grass-roots political-advocacy group devoted to the cause of small government, free markets, and liberty.\nOnly a few years ago, it was they who were sponsoring the hate.\nTelevision ads sponsored by the group featured the claim that Obama\u2019s plan was \u201ca government takeover\u201d of health care, which PolitiFact named \u201cthe lie of the year\u201d in 2010.\nThe big donors in the Republican Party are reportedly flummoxed by the toxic rhetoric of Donald Trump.\nCharles Koch was so enthralled with the Freedom School that he got his three brothers and many friends to attend."}
