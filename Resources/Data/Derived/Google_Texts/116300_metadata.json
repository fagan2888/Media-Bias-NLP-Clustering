The dollar's fall in recent weeks was a function of market expectations that U.S. rate hikes will come more slowly.\n\n\"If you look at indicators, we are hopeful that (solid U.S. growth) will continue and over time, stabilize the currency situation. The dollar could then gain vis-a-vis the euro and Swiss franc,\" he said.\n\nIn a separate interview with Reuters, Jordan said there was little talk about warring currency policies at the IMF, World Bank and G20 meetings this week and no dissent over pledges to avoid targeting exchange rates for export advantage.\n\n\"There was not a really big discussion about currency wars. That was not something at the center of the multilateral meetings,\" Jordan said. \"It's clear that it does not make any sense to (gain) a competitive advantage by lowering the value of (ones) own currency.\"\n\n(Reporting by David Lawder and Leika Kihara; Editing by Andrea Ricci)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Swiss National Bank Chairman Thomas Jordan said on Saturday glo", "title": "SNB's Jordan: finance chiefs support Swiss negative rates", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/16/SNBs-Jordan-Not-looking-specific-currency-deciding-policy-action", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/imf-g20_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/16/SNBs-Jordan-Not-looking-specific-currency-deciding-policy-action", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/imf-g20_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Swiss National Bank Chairman Thomas Jordan said on Saturday glo", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Although there are limits to how low rates can go and how long low rates can be used as a policy tool, he said Swiss rates are not yet at a tipping point.\n\"It's recognized by everybody that the Swiss franc is still significantly overvalued and poses a difficult situation for Switzerland,\" he said.\n\"If you look at indicators, we are hopeful that (solid U.S. growth) will continue and over time, stabilize the currency situation.\nThe dollar could then gain vis-a-vis the euro and Swiss franc,\" he said.\nThat was not something at the center of the multilateral meetings,\" Jordan said."}
