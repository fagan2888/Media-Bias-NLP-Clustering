Dold was nobody's idea of an \"incendiary\" or Tea Party candidate in 2010 or 2012. He won the seat formerly held by now-Sen. Mark Kirk, a slice of Greater Chicagoland usually won by moderate Republicans, a slice that Democrats expected to take. In 2012 the Democrat-run legislature made Dold's 10th District harder to win, giving him territory that had voted 63\u201336 for Obama over McCain. To hold on, he voted frequently against the conservatives, earning a 40 percent rating from the American Conservative Union, 40 percent from Heritage Action, and 38 percent from the Club for Growth. The Times writes that Dold \"benefitted from the Tea Party\" but was \"one of the more moderate members of the House.\"\n\nRight. In 2012, if you wanted to find out how a Republican might buck the conservatives and win in swing districts, you covered Robert Dold.
