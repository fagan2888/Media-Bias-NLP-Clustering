But the same federal court has issued an injunction to prevent the EPA from making a final decision.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s decision is a significant victory for Pebble as it allows us to advance our case,\u201d Tom Collier, Pebble\u2019s chief executive, said in a statement. \u201cThe judge\u2019s decision says that we have raised plausible claims that EPA improperly utilized input from anti-mining groups in the establishment of the Bristol Bay Watershed Assessment.\u201d\n\nThe United Tribes of Bristol Bay, a coalition of native groups fighting the mine, said it was disappointed by Holland\u2019s refusal to dismiss the case entirely.\n\n\u201cAlthough we are disappointed with the court\u2019s ruling today, we remain confident that further proceedings will demonstrate that EPA has conducted a fair and transparent process in Bristol Bay,\u201d Robert Heyano, the group\u2019s president, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThe [EPA\u2019s] actions to protect our fishery and way of life continues to have full support from our region. This case is simply another delay tactic from Pebble,\u201d he said.\n\nNicole Navas, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department, which is representing the EPA, said lawyers are reviewing Holland\u2019s decision and she would not comment further.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "EPA is trying to stop the Pebble gold and copper mine from being developed.", "description": "EPA is trying to stop the Pebble gold and copper mine from being developed.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Timothy Cama", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "EPA is trying to stop the Pebble gold and copper mine from being developed.", "title": "Case against EPA on Alaska mine moves forward", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/244125-case-against-epa-on-alaska-mine-moves-forward", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/alaska_getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T03:39-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/244125-case-against-epa-on-alaska-mine-moves-forward", "dcterms.date": "2015-06-05T10:37-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Timothy Cama", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Environmental Protection Agency, Pebble Mine,,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-05T10:37:22-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/244125-case-against-epa-on-alaska-mine-moves-forward", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "EPA is trying to stop the Pebble gold and copper mine from being developed.", "card": "summary", "title": "Case against EPA on Alaska mine moves forward"}, "dcterms.title": "Case against EPA on Alaska mine moves forward"}, "article_summary": "The Pebble case has taken on national traction as the EPA tries to protect the nation\u2019s top salmon habitat from what developers say could be a major boon for Alaska.\nPebble Mine is a massive gold and copper mine near Bristol Bay that the EPA is trying to block.\nBut the same federal court has issued an injunction to prevent the EPA from making a final decision.\nThe case only centers around the scientific assessment the EPA prepared last year to inform its decisions.\nA federal court has decided to allow a lawsuit to proceed from the developer of a proposed Alaskan mine who is challenging the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s (EPA) attempts to block the project."}
