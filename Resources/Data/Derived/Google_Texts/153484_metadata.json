Still, the state\u2019s Republican leaders accused the Obama administration of economy-damaging overreach that will drive up energy costs.\n\nGeorgia Attorney General Sam Olens said the new regulations were a \u201cclassic example of the Obama administration\u2019s pattern of attempting to accomplish with regulation what it cannot achieve with legislation.\u201d\n\nThe Clean Power Plan is the White House\u2019s most forceful effort yet to combat climate change, with the goal of moving away from coal-fired power and reduce planet-warming carbon emissions.\n\n+ Hyosub Shin Georgia Power\u2019s Plant Hammond, a coal-fired power station near Rome, on May 12. HYOSUB SHIN / HSHIN@AJC.COM Hyosub Shin \u00d7\n\nIt lets states and utilities determine how to generate electricity under the new guidelines, and Georgia Power is already reducing its reliance on coal, particularly with the nuclear facilities at Plant Vogtle under construction.\n\nThe Obama administration and other supporters say the plan will help blunt the impact of carbon pollution, jump-start the creation of new jobs in the wind, solar and nuclear fields, and shut down the hundreds of coal-fired power plants that emit the most carbon pollution.\n\n\u201cWe expect polluters and their allies to throw everything they\u2019ve got at the Clean Power Plan, and we expect them to fail,\u201d said Michael Brune, the Sierra Club\u2019s executive director. \u201cThe Clean Power Plan is based on a law passed by Congress, upheld by the Supreme Court and demanded by the American people.\u201d\n\nRelated News on Georgia government\n\nCritics, though, say that restricting power generation hampers economic growth, that renewable energy is not reliable enough and that Obama\u2019s efforts will have little practical effect on climate change \u2014 particularly with China surpassing the U.S. as the world\u2019s top carbon emitter.\n\n\u201cWe worry it will be harmful to Georgia\u2019s economy,\u201d said Judson Turner, the head of Georgia\u2019s Environmental Protection Division. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to do this, let\u2019s do it in the best way that\u2019s mindful to Georgia\u2019s business climate.\u201d\n\nRegulation option followed block by Congress\n\nDuring his first term, when Congress was in Democratic hands, Obama tried and failed to pass a cap-and-trade system for carbon emissions. Since then, he has gone around Congress and tested the limits of the EPA\u2019s powers to regulate heat-trapping gases most scientists say lead to rising temperatures.\n\nMost of the 24 states filing the legal challenges are led by Republicans, but four states governed by Democrats joined in contending that Obama\u2019s move is an unprecedented power grab.\n\n\u201cPetitioners will show the final rule is in excess of the agency\u2019s statutory authority, goes beyond the bounds set by the United States Constitution, and otherwise is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion and not in accordance with the law,\u201d the states wrote in a short filing.\n\nThe legal battle is widely expected to wind up in the U.S. Supreme Court. The EPA has laid the groundwork for years, first by establishing that greenhouse gas emissions are harmful to human health, and thus fall under the purview of the Clean Air Act. (That finding was upheld in court.)\n\n\u201cWe are confident we will again prevail against these challenges and will be able to work with states to successfully implement these first-ever national standards to limit carbon pollution, the largest source of carbon emissions in the United States,\u201d EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy said.\n\nThe administration has said the regulation is not only legal but vital. World leaders will gather in Paris later this year for a climate summit, and the U.S. plan could help encourage other big nations to band together on a climate pact with the goal of preventing what many scientists predict will be devastating sea level rise and other global warming fallout.\n\nThe White House and environmental groups paint a dirty picture of Georgia\u2019s carbon-damaged environment. Asthma, for example, harms 8 percent of adult Georgians and 11 percent of the state\u2019s children, according to the Atlanta-based U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nAmid fierce opposition, though, the Obama administration scaled back the sharp reduction of greenhouse gases it first required for Georgia.\n\nThat plan would have restricted Georgia to release no more than 834 pounds of carbon per megawatt hour by 2030. A later draft allowed Georgia to release 1,049 pounds per megawatt hour, a more readily achievable goal. It also delayed the start of the new emissions targets from 2020 to 2022.\n\nGeorgia leaders, who have unsuccessfully challenged key tenets of the Affordable Care Act and other Obama policies in similar multistate suits, are readying a contingency in case the courts dismiss the lawsuit. Turner, the head of the EPD, said the agency is working with utilities, politicians, local governments and others on what he calls a \u201cdelicate\u201d dual-track strategy.\n\n\u201cThese are big decisions, and they\u2019re still in front of us,\u201d he said. \u201cGeorgia is going to be very deliberate moving forward, and we\u2019re going to take the time we\u2019ve got to be deliberate and thoughtful about the outcome.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Georgia filed a lawsuit Friday to block President Barack Obama\u2019s ambitious climate change agenda, joining two dozen states in opposing a forced reduction of carbon emissions.", "author": "By Greg Bluestein\u00a0and\u00a0Daniel Malloy - The Atlanta Journal-Constitution", "og": {"url": "http://www.myajc.com/news/news/state-regional-govt-politics/georgia-joins-suit-trying-to-block-obama-climate-c/nn8Z2/", "image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/img/photos/2015/05/15/44/60/051615-Coosa-HS03.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Georgia filed a lawsuit Friday to block President Barack Obama\u2019s ambitious climate change agenda, joining two dozen states in opposing a forced reduction of carbon emissions.", "title": "Georgia joins suit trying to block Obama climate change plan"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/resize/120x120/img/photos/2015/05/15/44/60/051615-Coosa-HS03.jpg", "description": "Georgia filed a lawsuit Friday to block President Barack Obama&rsquo;s ambitious climate change agenda, joining two dozen states in opposing a forced reduction of carbon emissions.", "card": "summary", "title": "Georgia joins suit trying to block Obama climate change plan"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "myajc", "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.myajc.com/news/news/state-regional-govt-politics/georgia-joins-suit-trying-to-block-obama-climate-c/nn8Z2/"}, "cmg_revpath": "/re/292/3111204/news/news/state-regional-govt-politics/georgia-joins-suit-trying-to-block-obama-climate-c/nn8Z2/", "keywords": "story-tpt-id:8340,state government,politics_ajc,politics,georgia news,ajctopstate,ajc-fedstategovt", "viewport": "shrink-to-fit=no, width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Georgia filed a lawsuit Friday to block President Barack Obama\u2019s ambitious climate change agenda, joining two dozen states in opposing a forced reduction of carbon emissions.\n\u201cWe expect polluters and their allies to throw everything they\u2019ve got at the Clean Power Plan, and we expect them to fail,\u201d said Michael Brune, the Sierra Club\u2019s executive director.\nThat plan would have restricted Georgia to release no more than 834 pounds of carbon per megawatt hour by 2030.\nAmid fierce opposition, though, the Obama administration scaled back the sharp reduction of greenhouse gases it first required for Georgia.\nStill, the state\u2019s Republican leaders accused the Obama administration of economy-damaging overreach that will drive up energy costs."}
