He\u2019s the guy who was a former FBI agent who didn\u2019t become a physician until he was in his 50s. Unless he\u2019s been performing some kind of magic trick that I can\u2019t figure out, he has a zest for life and as much energy as someone 40 years his junior.\n\nI had come to say goodbye. Carrison\u2019s one of those people I\u2019ve met in more than 40 years of journalism, and nearly 70 years of life, who\u2019s had a profound effect on me. He, too, admits to having real concerns about changing gears later in life; \u201cI admit I was scared med school might not work out.\u201d But that only gives more power to the line he often quotes: \u201cIt is better to try and to fail than to fail to try and forever experience the inestimable loss of what might have been.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve agonized over this decision to leave Las Vegas. What finally made me act as I have is the sense that my life clock seems to be ticking louder every day. My wife and I have decided to enter a full-time Heritage Studies doctoral program that explores the interrelationships of history, literature, geography, anthropology, culture, environment and folklore. Arkansas State University in Jonesboro has the only program of its kind in the nation.\n\nThat I\u2019ll be getting my Ph.D. after one of my daughters really isn\u2019t surprising. Seven years ago, 42 years after I asked Patricia Harden to marry me, she finally said yes. Things seem to work out a little more slowly for me.\n\nMy last day at the Review-Journal was Friday. I\u2019m now driving a Penske rental truck eastbound on Interstate 40.\n\nHow we\u2019ve gotten to this time and place \u2014 the Mississippi Delta serves as a kind of living laboratory for this academic program \u2014 fascinates me. In journalism that translates to what I\u2019m a stickler for \u2014 context. Too often I\u2019ve felt that the rush of daily journalism hasn\u2019t given me the time to put two and two together. I hope this program will give me a chance to better understand why and how things add up.\n\nThis wouldn\u2019t have been a difficult decision if I didn\u2019t love what I do. The Review-Journal gave me the opportunity to pursue some meaningful journalism. For that I\u2019ll be forever grateful. I think we\u2019ve been able to give Southern Nevadans a better handle on health issues. That\u2019s something we can be proud of.\n\nI\u2019m not retiring. In fact, I have to pick up the pace to be happy. I\u2019ve got books to publish, pieces to write, teaching to do, students to mentor, children to nurture. For too long I\u2019ve whined that jobs and family obligations only gave me time to turn out one book. No more. I take heart in the fact that Laura Ingalls Wilder didn\u2019t publish her first novel until she was 65, yet she still managed to crank out 12 books in the \u201cLittle House On the Prairie\u201d series.\n\nIf I come back to my first love of daily journalism, my work should show a better sense of how America has evolved.\n\nIn the living laboratory that is Las Vegas, no one\u2019s situation moved me more than that of Elizabeth Trujillo.\n\nAs you may remember from my earlier pieces on her, Trujillo discovered in 2012 that she had two lumps in her right breast. Laid off from a job without benefits \u2014 her husband\u2019s construction job also didn\u2019t offer them \u2014 she didn\u2019t have insurance coverage or money to pay for care.\n\nUnable then to get Medicaid \u2014 government workers told her she would get insurance only if she became pregnant again \u2014 Trujillo heard from her circle of friends and acquaintances that only by getting a job with insurance could she get the care she needed. She said a family care doctor she visited and paid with cash never pointed her toward possible free care through the American Cancer Society or any other entity.\n\nThe 29-year-old mother of three young children prayed she could get a job with insurance. She got one, but it wasn\u2019t until five months after she discovered her lumps \u2014 by that time one was as large as an orange \u2014 that she received the surgical, drug and radiation treatment necessary for what was diagnosed as breast cancer.\n\nIt was much too late.\n\nShe was already stage 4 when she presented herself to doctors. Later, when the Affordable Care Act kicked in, she received insurance through the state exchange. But the cancer had spread to her bones.\n\nTrujillo and her family prayed for a miracle.\n\nThe miracle didn\u2019t happen. She died in her dad\u2019s home in Montrose, Colo., on Aug. 2, three weeks before her life insurance policy went into effect. Megan Hess, the owner of the Sunset Mesa Funeral Home in Montrose, which handled her Aug. 6 funeral, said she originally based the arrangements on the policy paying off. \u201cShe had to be alive for 24 months and just missed it,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m out $9,200 but I slept good knowing the mother of three children had a beautiful funeral.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve never met anyone who exhibited more grace under pressure than Trujillo. Even though she was in considerable pain and grew weaker every day, she wouldn\u2019t allow herself or her family to engage in a pity party. She always brought a conversation about her situation back to the joy her children brought her, about her educational dreams for them.\n\nYes, she believed that there should be universal health coverage \u2014 \u201cthat\u2019s only fair\u201d \u2014 but she wasn\u2019t bitter.\n\n\u201cI just hate to see young kids like mine grow up without a mother,\u201d she said in our last conversation a couple of months ago.\n\nAs I stood on her front lawn, I told her I was having a difficult time deciding on whether to go back to school.\n\n\u201cIf you really want to do it, you should,\u201d she said. \u201cYou only live once.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"parsely-link": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/columns-blogs/your-health/age-not-factor-career-changes", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "PAUL HARASIM LAS VEGAS REVIEW-JOURNAL", "parsely-title": "Age not a factor for career changes", "parsely-image-url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/defaultimage.jpg", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/columns-blogs/your-health/age-not-factor-career-changes", "creator": {"identifier": "@reviewjournal", "id": 15358759}, "description": "I felt better the minute I entered UMC\u2019s Trauma Center the other day.", "card": "summary", "title": "Age not a factor for career changes"}, "parsely-pub-date": "2014-08-10T23:24:12Z", "vf": {"unique_id": "reviewjournal-nid-1908606"}, "al": {"web": {"should_fallback": "true"}, "android": {"url": "review-journal://?eid=1739904", "app_name": "review-journal", "package": "com.LVRJ"}, "ios": {"url": "review-journal://?eid=1739904", "app_store_id": 540820524, "app_name": "review-journal"}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=540820524", "fb": {"admins": 630759385, "app_id": 195491203833571}, "google-play-app": "app-id=com.LVRJ", "parsely-author": "PAUL HARASIM LAS VEGAS REVIEW-JOURNAL", "parsely-section": "Blog_Paul Harasim", "keywords": "Paul Harasim,Health, Life,", "parsely-type": "post", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-10T16:24:12-07:00"}, "parsely-tags": "Blog_Paul Harasim,Health,Life", "og": {"site_name": "Las Vegas Review-Journal", "description": "I felt better the minute I entered UMC\u2019s Trauma Center the other day.", "title": "Age not a factor for career changes", "url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/columns-blogs/your-health/age-not-factor-career-changes", "image": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/defaultimage.jpg", "type": "article"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=0.9", "description": "I felt better the minute I entered UMC\u2019s Trauma Center the other day."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf529\"", "article_summary": "She died in her dad\u2019s home in Montrose, Colo., on Aug. 2, three weeks before her life insurance policy went into effect.\nLaid off from a job without benefits \u2014 her husband\u2019s construction job also didn\u2019t offer them \u2014 she didn\u2019t have insurance coverage or money to pay for care.\nHe\u2019s the guy who was a former FBI agent who didn\u2019t become a physician until he was in his 50s.\nWhat finally made me act as I have is the sense that my life clock seems to be ticking louder every day.\nThe 29-year-old mother of three young children prayed she could get a job with insurance."}
