Their home is their safe place,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s where they\u2019re supposed to be safe at all time. To have somebody come in and take that from them, it\u2019s trying to build that safe place back.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe family said they\u2019re staying at a friend\u2019s house Christmas Even night and open presents with their children in the morning.\n\n\u201cI was more the look on their faces and the fact that all I could think was that they\u2019re going to think Santa Claus didn\u2019t want to bring them anything,\u201d Christine Cottier said. \u201cBecause, you know, you threaten your kids throughout the year and say, \u2018If you\u2019re not good Santa\u2019s not going to bring you anything.\u2019 Come Christmas day and there\u2019s nothing there, they\u2019re going to think the worst things.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30;polling-uri=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=1;polling-uri2=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=2;polling-uri3=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=3;polling-uri4=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=4;polling-uri5=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=5;cycle=1", "dcterms.created": "2015-12-24 23:20:00", "description": "A solider in Raeford is trying to pick up the pieces after thieves ransacked his family's house and took the gifts meant for his three small children.", "application-name": "WRAL.com", "dcterms.modified": "2015-12-25 22:50:34", "outbrain": {"ob_desc": "id_asset=15195983|asset_type=story"}, "twitter": {"description": "A solider in Raeford is trying to pick up the pieces after thieves ransacked his family's house and took the gifts meant for his three small children.", "title": "Soldier's house robbed on Christmas Eve in Raeford :: WRAL.com", "url": "http://www.wral.com/soldier-s-house-robbed-on-christmas-eve-in-raeford/15195983/", "image": "http://wwwcache.wral.com/asset/news/local/2015/12/24/15195985/15195985-1451016628-160x120.jpg", "site": "@wral", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#041E30", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "robots": "index,follow", "pinterest": "nohover", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/favicons/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/favicons/mstile-310x150.png", "fb": {"app_id": 334167666672300}, "author": "WRAL", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-24T23:20:00-05:00"}, "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/favicons/mstile-150x150.png", "og": {"site_name": "WRAL.com", "description": "A solider in Raeford is trying to pick up the pieces after thieves ransacked his family's house and took the gifts meant for his three small children.", "title": "Soldier's house robbed on Christmas Eve in Raeford :: WRAL.com", "url": "http://www.wral.com/soldier-s-house-robbed-on-christmas-eve-in-raeford/15195983/", "image": "http://wwwcache.wral.com/asset/news/local/2015/12/24/15195985/221752-Candace_package_photo_2-960x540.jpg", "type": "article"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msapplication-TileImage": "/favicons/mstile-144x144.png"}, "article_summary": "\u201cKids like that are emotional and they\u2019re going to feel it and we\u2019re going to feel it,\u201d Christine Cottier said.\nChristine and Joseph Cottier returned home on Christmas Eve to find that someone broke into their son\u2019s bedroom, stole Christmas presents and also left garbage on the front porch.\nOther soldiers have stepped in to help, but the family still faced with the task of restoring their children\u2019s sense of security.\n\u201cI was more the look on their faces and the fact that all I could think was that they\u2019re going to think Santa Claus didn\u2019t want to bring them anything,\u201d Christine Cottier said.\n\u201cBecause, you know, you threaten your kids throughout the year and say, \u2018If you\u2019re not good Santa\u2019s not going to bring you anything.\u2019 Come Christmas day and there\u2019s nothing there, they\u2019re going to think the worst things.\u201d"}
