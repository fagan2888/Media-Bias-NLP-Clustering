These products included nuts and other snack products (flavored almonds, pecan panko and corn nuts), berries, vegetables, and seafood,\u201d it added.\n\nWhole Foods said in a statement: \u201cWe disagree with the DCA\u2019s overreaching allegations and we are vigorously defending ourselves. We cooperated fully with the DCA from the beginning until we disagreed with their grossly excessive monetary demands. Despite our requests to the DCA, they have not provided evidence to back up their demands nor have they requested any additional information from us, but instead have taken this to the media to coerce us.\u201d\n\nWATCH: Why hunger is a distribution problem\n\nFalsely labeling a package carries a first-time fine as high as $950 and up to $1,700 for subsequent violations. \u201cThe potential number of violations that Whole Foods faces for all prepackaged goods in the NYC stores is in the thousands,\u201d the agency also said.\n\nThe investigation was first reported by the New York Daily News.\n\nShares of Whole Foods were down slightly late morning Wednesday.\n\nThis article originally appeared on NBCNews.com", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "New York City's Department of Consumer Affairs (DCA) said Wednesday that an ongoing investigation of Whole Foods Market stores has found systemic overcharging.", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/whole-foods-overcharging-customers-new-york-city-agency-finds", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "New York City's Department of Consumer Affairs (DCA) said Wednesday that an ongoing investigation of Whole Foods Market stores has found systemic overcharging.", "title": "Whole Foods overcharging customers, New York City agency finds", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/whole-foods-overcharging-customers-new-york-city-agency-finds", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/articles/rtr30b7x.jpg?itok=8J6qYVP6", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/whole-foods-overcharging-customers-new-york-city-agency-finds", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/articles/rtr30b7x.jpg?itok=vWVk63h0", "title": "Whole Foods overcharging customers, New York City agency finds", "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "New York City's Department of Consumer Affairs (DCA) said Wednesday that an ongoing investigation of Whole Foods Market stores has found systemic overcharging."}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2015-06-24T18:14:16-04:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "nv": {"date": "06/24/2015 18:14:16 EDT", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/whole-foods-overcharging-customers-new-york-city-agency-finds", "published": 1, "tags": "food,health", "title": "Whole Foods overcharging customers, New York City agency finds"}, "article": {"author": "http://www.facebook.com/msnbc"}, "abstract": "New York City's Department of Consumer Affairs (DCA) said Wednesday that an ongoing investigation of Whole Foods Market stores has found systemic overcharging.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Health, Food"}, "article_summary": "New York City\u2019s Department of Consumer Affairs (DCA) said Wednesday that an ongoing investigation of Whole Foods Market stores has found systemic overcharging of its customers for prepackaged food.\n\u201cThe potential number of violations that Whole Foods faces for all prepackaged goods in the NYC stores is in the thousands,\u201d the agency also said.\nWhole Foods said in a statement: \u201cWe disagree with the DCA\u2019s overreaching allegations and we are vigorously defending ourselves.\n\u201cThe overcharges ranged from [80 cents] for a package of pecan panko to $14.84 for a package of coconut shrimp,\u201d the agency said in a statement.\nThe investigation was first reported by the New York Daily News."}
