(Photo: Jenna Esarey, special to the CJ)Buy Photo\n\nProm season is nearly here and that means the fun, angst and expense of prom dress shopping is striking thousands of local teenage girls nearly simultaneously. To help reduce the expense of prom, the Clark County 4-H Junior Leaders hosted their annual Prom Aid at the 4-H Fairgrounds in Charlestown on Saturday.\n\nHundreds of dresses, collected by the group throughout the year, were offered free of charge with no requirements of the recipients other than the promise that they were to be worn to a high school prom.\n\n\u201cWe had a line waiting to get in at 9,\u201d said Macie McCarty, 16, a Junior Leader and a junior at New Washington High School. \u201cMost of them found dresses.\u201d\n\nThe sparse, concrete-floored Community Building at the fairgrounds was transformed into an ad hoc department store, with rack upon rack of dresses, one small rack of menswear, and a small selection of shoes and jewelry.\n\nNow in its ninth year, the Junior Leaders collected about 500 dresses for the event. Most are gently used, but a very few still had their original tags. Donated clothing is cleaned by Nu Yale Cleaners at no cost to the group.\n\nThe building's restrooms were transformed into dressing rooms with the addition of a few throw rugs, and an open area nearby was decked out with a plethora of mirrors resting on metal folding chairs to provide the ladies with views of every angle.\n\nChris Collins patiently waited outside the dressing room while his daughter, Taylor, 17, tried on dresses. \u201cI\u2019m mostly just here to hold things and say yay or nay,\u201d he said.\n\nTaylor found a dress she loved on only her second try. \u201cThis is the one,\u201d she said as she spun in front of the mirror. \u201cI love this one.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe came last year, too,\u201d said her mother, Vicki Collins. \u201cIt\u2019s a great thing for the community. We priced dresses last year. I don\u2019t even want to look this year. Plus, we have a junior son, so we\u2019ll have to get him a tux. Doing both would be crazy.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nRead or Share this story: http://cjky.it/1RblqSU", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Prom season is nearly here and that means the fun, angst, and expense of prom dress shopping is striking thousands of local teenage girls nearly simultaneously.", "og": {"site_name": "The Courier-Journal", "description": "Prom season is nearly here and that means the fun, angst, and expense of prom dress shopping is striking thousands of local teenage girls nearly simultaneously.", "title": "Free gowns help ease frowns over prom", "url": "http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/local/indiana/2016/03/19/free-gowns-help-ease-frowns-over-prom/82010284/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/courier-journal.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Prom season is nearly here and that means the fun, angst, and expense of prom dress shopping is striking thousands of local teenage girls nearly simultaneously.", "title": "Free gowns help ease frowns over prom", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f55ab62a3526e2f67f90e71ad0659bb22bbc47f2/c=41-0-574-533&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/03/19/Louisville/Louisville/635940003740175418-Prom-photo-2.jpg", "creator": "@courierjournal", "site": "@courierjournal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600030236", "fb": {"app_id": 128534137209813}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Subjects/Proms", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Subjects/Proms", "title": "Free gowns help ease frowns over prom", "author": "Jenna Esarey", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/local/indiana", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/fb95f6ab4c4c2bfbd5cadd36a701e0a034d0ec80/c=46-0-446-533/local/-/media/2016/03/19/Louisville/Louisville/635940003740175418-Prom-photo-2.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6d700efa733db2ebe6e88e00ab76dcd19c23c5b6/c=41-0-574-533/local/-/media/2016/03/19/Louisville/Louisville/635940003740175418-Prom-photo-2.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b5f7dffb7f4bde98489999aa45d376cc8ae5507e/c=42-0-751-533/local/-/media/2016/03/19/Louisville/Louisville/635940003740175418-Prom-photo-2.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c205ae106f6dc10a3d7c64ecce13ccd5b7f72574/c=0-41-800-493&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2016/03/19/Louisville/Louisville/635940003740175418-Prom-photo-2.jpg", "publishtime": "2016-03-19T23:13:16.570000-04:00", "shorthed": "Free gowns help ease frowns over prom", "articleid": 82010284, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/02b520e98a6300feb44450e90e5ee0de1215e42e/c=0-41-800-493/local/-/media/2016/03/19/Louisville/Louisville/635940003740175418-Prom-photo-2.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1e95c9eba3e0108a5a0768dfa052e82bdb1b0589/c=58-0-356-533/local/-/media/2016/03/19/Louisville/Louisville/635940003740175418-Prom-photo-2.jpg"}}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf285\"", "article_summary": "To help reduce the expense of prom, the Clark County 4-H Junior Leaders hosted their annual Prom Aid at the 4-H Fairgrounds in Charlestown on Saturday.\nBuy Photo Shoppers look over gently used prom dresses at the annual 4-H Junior Leader Prom Aid event at the Clark County 4-H Fairgrounds in Charlestown on Saturday.\nHundreds of dresses, collected by the group throughout the year, were offered free of charge with no requirements of the recipients other than the promise that they were to be worn to a high school prom.\n\u201cWe had a line waiting to get in at 9,\u201d said Macie McCarty, 16, a Junior Leader and a junior at New Washington High School.\nNow in its ninth year, the Junior Leaders collected about 500 dresses for the event."}
