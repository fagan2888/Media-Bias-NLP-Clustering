Radicalized gays and their supporters are now emboldened to use the power of the law and the pressure of social media to force Christians to compromise their faith and sacrifice their own legal rights.\n\nThe RFRA was supposed to help protect individual Christians and all citizens who dissent from radical secular tenets based on their religious beliefs from becoming the target of withering personal attacks, lawsuits, boycotts, smear campaigns, persecution and even death threats from radical individuals and organizations.\n\nBut, having passed a measure that was meant to protect such individuals, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence and the Indiana General Assembly reversed themselves on this legislation after just over a week of intense criticism. By passing, under organized pressure, an amendment that undercuts the RFRA, they\u2019ve transformed themselves from champions of religious liberty to appeasers of gay extremists\u2019 demands with the stroke of a pen.\n\nRead also: Memories Pizza new face of RFRA debate\n\nPence has clearly proved that officials elected to high office fear being the target of gays and their orchestrated hate campaigns as much as anyone. What chance does the average citizen have in securing his or her individual rights from these swift, organized propaganda attacks?\n\nCase in point: After passage of Indiana\u2019s RFRA, television reporter Alyssa Marino of ABC 57 News drove for half an hour simply to ask Crystal O\u2019Connor, known to be a Christian and the owner of Memories Pizza in Walkerton, Ind., about her policy toward catering a same-sex marriage.\n\nO\u2019Connor answered, \u201cIf a gay couple came in and wanted us to provide pizzas for their wedding, we would have to say no. We are a Christian establishment.\u201d O\u2019Connor made it clear that otherwise anyone, including gay couples, are welcome patrons.\n\nMemories Pizza never has never been asked, nor has the business actually rejected catering a gay ceremony. No matter. The story ran as \u201cRFRA: First Indiana business to publicly deny same-sex service.\u201d Within hours, pro-gay extremists began sending hate-filled tweets demanding boycotts and making death threats while leftist pro-gay media outlets fanned the flames.\n\nSalon tweeted (and later deleted), \u201cThat anti-LGBT pizza shop in Indiana is getting exactly what it deserves.\u201d The tweet linked to a short article that made no mention of the intimidation or death threats.\n\nLegal analyst for CNN Jeffery Toobin declared, \u201cThose who support the RFRA law are \u2018precisely parallel\u2019 to those who \u2018indulged\u2019 racial segregation in the 1950s and 1960s on religious grounds.\u201d\n\nThe Huffington Post ran the misleading headline \u201cIndiana\u2019s Memories Pizza Reportedly Becomes First Business To Reject Catering Gay Weddings,\u201d following that with the false narrative that Memories is \u201cthe first business to publicly vow to reject gay weddings in the wake of Indiana\u2019s controversial Religious Freedom Restoration Act.\u201d\n\nIndividual pro-gay radicals went even further. The Memories Pizza website was hacked and filled with obscene images. Jessica Dooley, a girls\u2019 coach at nearby Concorde High School, tweeted, \u201cWho\u2019s going to Walkerton with me to burn down #Memories Pizza.\u201d\n\nWhen the superheated misinformation campaign began to backfire and support for the owners from across the nation raised $753,000 in a GoFundMe crowdfunding campaign for the besieged owners, intimidation and threats expanded to that website, targeting both O\u2019Connor and the campaign organizer Lawrence Billy Jones III.\n\nAustin Kasso (who now claims his Twitter account was hacked) tweeted: \u201cGo to hell you stupid bigots. Don\u2019t think you can hold onto that money for long \u2013 you don\u2019t deserve this money and we are coming to rob you.\u201d\n\nAnother tweet with the ominous moniker LawrenceMomIsScrewed threatened the family of one campaign organizer Lawrence B. Jones III: \u201c\u2026any smart person that is planning something will not threaten you. You won\u2019t see it coming.\u201d Another tweet asked, \u201cgot any family?\u201d\n\nWithin a few days and seeing the political writing on the wall, Pence publicly asked for a fix to clarify any \u201cmisunderstandings,\u201d which, in fact, were fabricated by the radical gay media campaign in the first place. \u201cLast weekend I called upon the Indiana General Assembly to clarify that this new judicial standard would not create a license to discriminate or to deny services to any individual as its critics have alleged,\u201d Pence said at a news conference.\n\nBut, like Obama\u2019s supposed fix meant to answer religious freedom protests concerning the mandatory funding of abortion through Obamacare insurance premiums, Pence\u2019s fix limited protection to religious organizations. He certainly did not enhance religious freedom for Indiana citizens in general.\n\nThe Indiana RFRA was gutted of the very religious liberty protections for individuals it was meant to enhance. Going even further, Pence specifically exempted the RFRA as any defense against gay lawsuits or the state of Indiana\u2019s bringing possible criminal charges for sexual orientation discrimination.\n\nMark Rienzi, professor at the Catholic University School of Law and counsel for the Beckett Fund, says that Indiana\u2019s \u201cChristian business owners\u2014florists, bakers, caterers and others\u2014will now be forced to provide service[s]\u201d against their own religious beliefs.\n\nAs founder of Mission America Linda Harvey said, \u201cThis \u2018fix\u2019 is everything gay activists could want.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the outpouring of financial support may keep Crystal O\u2019Connor from financial ruin, but she still fears for her life. At last report, she is still in hiding.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Radicalized gays are now emboldened to use legal and social media pressure to force Christians to compromise their faith and sacrifice their own legal rights.", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "author": "Paul E.
