â€” A Clayton woman has been charged with driving while impaired after she rear-ended a parked police cruiser with its blue lights flashing and siren blaring, police said Monday.

Charae Chantel Wallace, 22, of 208 Wexford Drive, also was charged with failure to reduce speed and failing to heed blue lights and siren.

Police said a Clayton officer had stopped on Barbour Mill Road Saturday morning to investigate a suspicious person when his patrol car was struck from behind. The officer suffered minor injuries, but the patrol car sustained major damage, police said.
