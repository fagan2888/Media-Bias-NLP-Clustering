Instead of waiting for the ballots to be counted, the party will take them and tabulate the results later.\n\nWith the votes finally in, the convention was officially adjourned.\n\n2:11 p.m. update:\n\nThe body passed its platform as it was presented to them without debate. Unlike the Washoe County Republican Party platform, the state platform left out many of the socially conservative planks that upset some younger voters.\n\nThere was a motion to turn the seven-page platform into a single page that was defeated resoundingly by the body.\n\nHere are a few planks from the platform:\n\nAbolishing the Internal Revenue Service\n\nEliminating minimum wage and prevailing wage laws\n\nOpposing common core, supporting student-loan privatization\n\nImplementing voter-ID laws\n\nSupporting Yucca Mountain\n\nMaking English the official language\n\nDefunding President Barack Obama\u2019s health care plan.\n\nFollow along live as RGJ political reporter Seth A. Richardson covers the event on Twitter and through updates at RGJ.com.\n\n12:17 p.m. update:\n\nThe convention passed a resolution denouncing lawmakers who voted in favor of the Commerce Tax, including Republican Gov. Brian Sandoval.\n\nThe Commerce Tax has been contentious since the governor ushered it through the 2015 Legislature as a way to fund education in the state. It overwhelmingly passed the Legislature, including with Republican support.\n\nThe resolution passed Sunday initially only honored those who voted against the plan, but an amendment included the denunciation of lawmakers who supported the measure.\n\nThe governor is not in attendance at the state convention.\n\n12:10 p.m. update:\n\nThe delegation passed several resolutions that would support the repeal of Obamacare, oppose a mandatory gun background-checks ballot initiative this November, support voter-ID laws and call on the executive branch to investigate \u201crecent hostile actions by federal law enforcement officials against Nevada residents.\u201d\n\nThe body is now discussing two resolutions, one honoring lawmakers who voted against the Commerce Tax and another supporting state control of public lands.\n\n11:56 a.m. update:\n\nRepublicans debated a rule that would remove elected officials as automatic members of the state central committee that ultimately failed.\n\nElected officials are automatically members of the state central committee. The change would have removed that rule, essentially kicking out elected officials from the group. They would still be able to run as regular members of the committee.\n\nChairman Michael McDonald rebuked the rule, saying there are lawmakers who actively avoid the party, but the ones who do the \u201cheavy lifting\u201d \u2013 raising money, serving in the Legislature and the like \u2013 deserve to be rewarded for their service.\n\nThe motion ultimately failed despite operatives from Donald Trump\u2019s campaign holding up a sign that said \u201cYes,\u201d indicating how they wanted their members to vote.\n\n10:17 a.m. update:\n\nThe Republican Party released its endorsement recommendations for state Senate and Assembly races. The list is not final and must be approved by the convention.\n\nThe list of endorsements for Northern Nevada races includes Jennifer Terhune over Jill Tolles, Kime King and Clint Jamison for Assembly District 25 in southwest Reno; Lisa Krasner over Jason Guinasso in Assembly District 26 in south Reno; and Chris Forbush and Sam England over Al Kramer and incumbent Assemblyman P.K. O\u2019Neill in Carson City.\n\nThe committee also recommended endorsing Eugene Hoover over Heidi Gansert in Senate District 15 in south Reno.\n\nThe convention will not endorse in congressional races.\n\nOriginal post:\n\nSunday marks day two of the Nevada Republican Party's state convention. The body selected 27 delegates yesterday amid a fairly low-key event. To read yesterday's recap, click here.\n\nBeginning at 9 a.m. today, the party will decide on a platform, pass referendums, elect state central committee members and endorse for the June 14 primary.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.rgj.com/27oYcDm", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Seth A.
