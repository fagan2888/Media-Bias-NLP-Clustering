The loss meant that CHO was put under \u201cenhanced oversight\u201d by the Maine Bureau of Insurance, requiring it to report on its finances monthly.\n\nThe reports have generally found that the company is following its plan and finances are stabilizing.\n\nIts losses were largely the result of rapid growth, particularly among people who were getting health insurance for the first time. In many cases, those cooperative members ran up big medical bills because they took care of health problems that they had put off while they were uninsured.\n\nIn addition,Community Health Options raised its rates only minimally last year, based on 2014\u2019s profits. Rate proposals are filed with state regulators in the first half of the year, but then take effect on Jan. 1 of the following year.\n\nEric Cioppa, the state\u2019s insurance superintendent, said the lower premium income is expected to stabilize in future months because most of the cooperative\u2019s policies went into effect on Jan. 1. And, he said, expenses \u2013 usually payments to health care vendors \u2013 were higher than planned for the first two months of the year, but lower in March and should be lower for the rest of the year as efforts to negotiate lower reimbursements bear fruit.\n\nCioppa said he also met last month with officials with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services about how and whether CHO will re-enter the insurance marketplace at the end of the year to sign up new members.\n\nCioppa clashed earlier this year with CMS when he sought to put Community Health Options into receivership and terminate thousands of policies as a way to cut the cooperative\u2019s losses. CHO had agreed to the approach, Cioppa said.\n\nBut federal regulators rejected that approach because a key provision of the ACA is a guarantee that policies will be renewed. Cioppa said that decision tied his hands on dealing with CHO\u2019s 2015 losses, despite the fact that dropped policyholders could have been picked up by the other two insurers in Maine\u2019s exchange.\n\nBut Cioppa said his discussions with CMS officials last month were positive and productive.\n\nThe Bureau of Insurance ordered Community Health Options to stop selling policies as losses grew last fall, but because of delays in how that order was implemented through CMS, it didn\u2019t take effect until late December. By that time, CHO\u2019s membership had already grown sharply.\n\nCioppa said the cooperative will file its rate proposal for 2017 next week and issue a quarterly financial report by mid-May.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Community Health Options' March report shows stabilizing operations.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "description": "Community Health Options' March report shows stabilizing operations.", "title": "Health insurance co-op's report shows membership and expenses are down - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/PHnewFBlogo.png", "updated_time": "2016-05-06T18:01:23-04:00", "url": "http://www.pressherald.com/2016/05/06/membership-is-down-but-so-are-expenses-in-health-co-op-report/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Community Health Options' March report shows stabilizing operations.", "title": "Health insurance co-op's report shows membership and expenses are down - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "image": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/PHnewFBlogo.png", "creator": "@pressherald", "site": "@pressherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=951845858", "fb": {"admins": 769488179, "app_id": 178078215650057}, "google-site-verification": "QWs9pxQP8fwo2-nR5mWopc6qCK2D3920f7bl-U-zkso", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pressherald", "section": "Business", "tag": "maine bureau of insurance", "published_time": "2016-05-06T17:34:28-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-06T18:01:23-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Community Health Options\u2019 efforts to keep a lid on membership is starting to pinch its income from premiums, and paid claims are running higher than expected.\nIts losses were largely the result of rapid growth, particularly among people who were getting health insurance for the first time.\nIn addition,Community Health Options raised its rates only minimally last year, based on 2014\u2019s profits.\nThe health insurance cooperative, based in Lewiston, told state regulators that total membership was 2 percent lower in March than had been projected and that meant a reduction in premiums of $4.3 million.\nCommunity Health Options reported a $31 million loss in 2015 after being the only cooperative created under the Affordable Care Act to report a profit in 2014."}
