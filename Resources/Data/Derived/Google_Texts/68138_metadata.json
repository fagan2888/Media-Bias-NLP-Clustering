Enter the code at harvestmark.com.\u201d An arrow on the sticker points at a sixteen-digit alphanumeric code on the label. I\u2019ve learned to ignore stickers on food\u2014so much visual noise accompanying phrases like \u201cNew look! Same great taste!\u201d and \u201c10% more. Free!\u201d Normally I would have lumped this particular code in with the many bar codes, QR codes, and other machine readable gibberish that litter products today. But as a researcher focusing on agriculture and technology I took the bait, visited the website and entered the code. The results were underwhelming. I noted that the raspberries\u2019 \u201csafety status\u201d read \u201cno issues reported.\u201d Then I felt naive for assuming that the food I bought was determined to be free of \u201cissues\u201d before it was put on the shelf. Was food safety now the responsibility of the consumer? What happened to the USDA, the FDA, and the A&P? I realized I\u2019d seen the same type of code before, remembering a package of mushrooms I\u2019d bought a few days earlier. I entered that code into HarvestMark too. Again, \u201cNo issues reported,\u201d but this time I was given some additional information\u2014their country of origin, state of origin, and packing location. The code from a package of spinach let me know that it had been grown in either Imperaial (sic) County, California or in Yuma or Maricopa counties, Arizona.\n\nHow was I supposed to interpret that information? What is my experience as a customer supposed to be? The industrial food supply has long relied on cultivating consumer assumptions of safe, \u201cfresh\u201d food. Revealing even a part of the circumstances of food production can be a contradiction. First, in informing me that \u201cno issues [have been] reported,\u201d HarvestMark is making me aware of the possibility of issues. It\u2019s a declaration prompting questions which wouldn\u2019t have been asked otherwise\u2014like someone selling me a car and telling me that no other owners have had the brakes fail yet. Second, in letting me know where and when my food was grown, HarvestMark is inverting the longstanding relationship between food producers their presentation of the idea \u201cfreshness,\u201d a presentation which has often relied on obscuring the details in order to present an ideal. Products may be \u201cfarm fresh,\u201d after a refrigerated journey from a site thousands of miles away. I spent a month or so researching and testing similar systems, including websites and smartphone apps such as FreshQC, Find The Farmer, and Trace Produce. FreshQC turned out to be a market research dupe. After I entered an alphanumeric code, the website rewarded me with a series of unsolicited multiple choice questions about the quality of my produce, but no information about its quality or origin. Find the Farmer presented more information than other systems, but was limited to producers of grain used in a particular brand of flour. Traceability does for food what FedEx or UPS package tracking software does for freight: using a unique tracking number, you are able to determine where something has been, what conditions it has encountered, and where it is going next. Data about \u201cfood objects\u201d is recorded and analyzed within meat, dairy and produce supply chains to assist with product recalls. This can make it easier, for example, to trace E. coli infested meat back to its point of contamination. As I dug deeper, it became clear that consumer-facing food traceability services were just an attempt to repackage that data and present it in a way that contradicted about a hundred years of food marketing practices.\n\nMost mass-produced fresh food items progress through a variety of steps between farm and table. An apple may grow at a particular tree at a particular location before being picked, processed and packed. Then it may be stored and shipped from and to different locations before being sold by a retailer. Some of these steps can significantly impair a food\u2019s quality. Traceability\u2014the name given to the process HarvestMark and similar services offer\u2014 attempts to make all of the steps between farm and table searchable, to aid in identifying and addressing problems after they happen. Traceability does for food what FedEx or UPS package tracking software does for freight: using a unique tracking number, you are able to determine where something has been, what conditions it has encountered, and where it is going next. Precision and scope vary significantly within existing food traceability systems. While the USDA characterizes the capacity of United States food producers as \u201cenormous,\u201d they add that \u201cSome traceability systems are deep, tracking food from the retailer back to the farm, while others extend back only to a key point in the production process.\u201d Of course, there will be significant variation in traceability because the types of foods produced and their production processes vary. Bacon is produced and processed differently than apples (thankfully). What should be recorded anyway? Have a look at the choices presented to you in an urban coffee shop to get a feel for the sorts of issues at play here: decaf, fair trade, shade grown, organic. Different attributes can be associated with transformative points in the supply chain. For instance, whether or not coffee is decaffeinated is dependent on processing, but whether or not it is fair trade is dependent on the relationships between growers, wholesalers, and retailers. Beyond such product specific variability, some systems are very precise, tracking food products to the minute of production or the exact area of a field where they were grown. Others are less precise, tracking products to farms in a large geographical area, such as the area served by a single grain elevator. Some traceability systems collect and track information on a broad range of attributes, while others track only a few.", "article_metadata": {"description": "If we know where our fresh food comes from, will we believe that it\u2019s really \u201cfresh\u201d?", "author": "Jonathan Lukens", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "If we know where our fresh food comes from, will we believe that it\u2019s really \u201cfresh\u201d?", "title": "Server Farm to Table", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2014/05/880936998_29a2dce7be_b/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/05/traceable-food-fresh/370903/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fced94\"", "article_summary": "Some traceability systems collect and track information on a broad range of attributes, while others track only a few.\nOthers are less precise, tracking products to farms in a large geographical area, such as the area served by a single grain elevator.\nMost mass-produced fresh food items progress through a variety of steps between farm and table.\nPrecision and scope vary significantly within existing food traceability systems.\nRevealing even a part of the circumstances of food production can be a contradiction."}
