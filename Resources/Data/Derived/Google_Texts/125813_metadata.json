The switch led to the Camp David peace accords, the defeat of a Soviet-sponsored rebellion in the Arabian Peninsula, the taming of the Communist regime in South Yemen and the containment of the Ba\u2019athist regimes of Syria and Iraq.\n\nSince the modern Middle East emerged from the debris of the Ottoman Empire after World War I, the region has needed an outside power to ensure stability by curbing internal and external ambitions, and acting as an honest broker.\n\nThrough the 1950s, Britain played that role. Then, until the late 1960s, the region was divided into Soviet and British spheres of influence, with the United States getting a cameo role every now and then. But by 1980, despite the fall of the pro-West regime in Iran, America was the principal guarantor of stability in the region.\n\nThen came President Obama, anxious to move US foreign policy away from what he regards as imperialism. And indeed, after five years of seizing every opportunity to underline his lack of interest in projecting US leadership, Obama seems to have succeeded in persuading many across the region that America\u2019s absence is no longer just a theoretical possibility, but a reality.\n\nThat fact \u2014 temporarily hidden by Hillary Clinton\u2019s energetic but ultimately unproductive activism \u2014 is highlighted by John Kerry\u2019s delusional dance on the margins.\n\nThe trouble is that, with the US absence, the Middle East faces a power vacuum that could tear it apart with unforeseeable consequences for regional peace and stability. The search for a new power capable of acting as a balancing force has intensified. Some in the region think Russia could and should assume that role.\n\nOn Syria, Obama made it clear that he\u2019s given Russia a permanent veto over US policy. Arab sources tell me that Kerry has advised them not to press on with a new UN resolution seeking greater pressure on Syrian despot Bashar al-Assad so as not to antagonize \u201cour Russian partners.\u201d\n\nWashington\u2019s new stance was reconfirmed with the \u201cnuclear deal\u201d with the mullahs in Tehran. Obama adopted a Russian \u201cfudge formula\u201d rejected by the Bush administration in 2006. Under it, Iran will continue its nuclear program while offering \u201crobust\u201d inspection of select sites.\n\nSuddenly, all roads seem to lead to Moscow.\n\nLast month, even Saudi Arabia, Washington\u2019s close ally since the \u201940s, seemed interested in probing closer ties to Russia. Prince Bandar bin Sultan, the Saudi intelligence and security head, flew to Moscow on an unprecedented visit for extensive talks with Vladimir Putin. Arab sources say he evoked the prospect of giving Russia a share of the kingdom\u2019s huge arms imports and joint ventures in oil and gas projects.\n\nIran instantly reacted by offering Russia \u201cpreferential conditions\u201d in developing oilfields in the Caspian sea and the Persian Gulf. President Hassan Rouhani even spoke of a Tehran-Moscow \u201cstrategic partnership\u201d to rid \u201cour region from the influence of distant powers,\u201d i.e., the United States. Rouhani has invited Putin to Tehran for the first state visit to the Islamic Republic by a Russian president.\n\nOver the past six months, Moscow has played host to delegations from the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Qatar, Kuwait and Iraq, all worried about Obama\u2019s decision to script the United States out of international leadership. Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif even led a delegation to Moscow to seek, believe it or not, a Russian role in \u201censuring the future of Afghanistan.\u201d Turkey, although a NATO member, has opened negotiations to purchase Russian arms.\n\nThe Syrian pro-democracy groups have also concluded that Russia may be the new \u201cbalancing power.\u201d This month, Ahmad Jarba of the Syrian National Coalition led a delegation to Moscow to discuss a deal where \u201cthe basic structures\u201d of the Syrian state would remain intact while Russia plays an \u201coversight role\u201d in a transition period. The upshot is that Russia would impose its policy of maintaining the Assad regime, with a few changes of personnel.\n\nThe latest pilgrim is Egypt\u2019s new military dictator, Abdul-Fattah el-Sissi, who last week flew to Moscow, the only foreign capital he has visited since his coup d\u2019\u00e9tat last July, for a photo-op with Putin.\n\nMoscow authorized the publication of a news item according to which Putin wished Sissi \u201csuccess in your presidential bid.\u201d In exchange, the Egyptians announced that Sissi had discussed buying $2.2 billion in Russian arms \u2014 restoring the position Russia lost in the 1970s.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "New York Post", "twitter": {"description": "Some 40 years ago, Egyptian President Anwar Sadat ended his regime\u2019s alliance with, and reliance on, the Soviet Union, and, in one of the Cold war\u2019s most dramatic turnabouts, joined the Middle", "title": "Handing the Middle East to Russia", "image": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/russia1.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=664&h=441&crop=1", "creator": "@nypost", "site": "@nypost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"post_id\":\"nypost-2987167\"}", "sailthru.tags": "foreign-policy,middle-east,russia,vladimir-putin,", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://nypost.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/0b14d9dbf0c711522a906102b60f3da0?s=16", "generator": "WordPress.com", "sailthru.date": "2014-02-16 22:17:15", "sailthru.title": "Handing the Middle East to\u00a0Russia", "nypost-section": "Opinion", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/russia1.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=231&h=154&crop=1", "description": "Some 40 years ago, Egyptian President Anwar Sadat ended his regime\u2019s alliance with, and reliance on, the Soviet Union, and, in one of the Cold war\u2019s most dramatic turnabouts, joined the Middle Eastern bloc of nations close to the United States.
