And Obama and his team are using a full-court press to increase its numbers in cities from Tampa to Seattle.\n\nIn interviews with WUSF on Thursday, the President and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell highlighted the affordability of health plans for low- and middle-income Americans, and issued what it calls the \"White House Healthy Communities Challenge.\" Obama is asking 20 U.S. cities to top one another in health care enrollment for the three-month period ending Jan. 30, 2016.\n\nIn exchange, the winning city gets \"bragging rights\" and a visit from Obama himself.\n\nThe White House said in a statement it is asking community groups to reach out to the uninsured \u2013 reminding them that the marketplaces provide tax credits for monthly premiums to people whose income falls between 100 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty level.\n\nIt\u2019s not exactly clear why Tampa was selected for the challenge. However, Florida is the third most populous state in the nation, and includes 2.8 million uninsured residents, according to estimates from the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nThe state has been among the most successful in enrolling people on the federal HealthCare.gov marketplace \u2013 the enrollment exchange for several dozen states. As of June 30, 1.3 million Floridians had purchased a plan on the exchange, the White House said in a statement.\n\nDespite that success, Tampa and Florida \u2013 where more than 15 percent of residents remain uninsured - face significant challenges in increasing its numbers of people with health coverage.\n\nFirst, an estimated 800,000 Floridians without insurance fall into a \u2018coverage gap.\u2019 Their income is too low to qualify for tax credits, and for the past three years, the Republican-led Florida legislature has declined to expand its Medicaid program to include those individuals. The issue appears unlikely to be considered by state lawmakers in 2016.\n\nAnd while the affordability of plans in Tampa is a feature administration officials highlighted during interviews Thursday at the White House, other parts of the state are reporting increases in premium costs.\n\nThe Florida Office of Insurance Regulation estimates that overall, marketplace plan costs will rise 9.5 percent in 2016. However, that estimate does not take into account subsidies someone may qualify for because of their income and how that would lower the consumer\u2019s costs.\n\nAnother issue state lawmakers are wrangling with is the issue of narrowing networks. Insurers are offering fewer doctors, practitioner and facility options for consumers in their plans. As a result, consumers with plans are discovering they can\u2019t find a doctor who falls in network.\n\nMary Shedden reports for WUSF in Tampa.
