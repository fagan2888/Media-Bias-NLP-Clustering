Wiley Adds CFA Test-Prep Service AnalystSuccess.com

The deal comes as the publisher focuses more on professional-training acquisitions, including CrossKnowledge

John Wiley and Sons Inc. (NYSE: JWA, JWB) is buying AnalystSuccess.com, a training program that helps prospective financial analysts prepare for the CFA exam.

The Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania-based business provides subject-matter experts, content and other technology to users. The American College of Financial Services, a nonprofit, private educational instutition, is selling the business.

"This content will enhance and expand our coverage across all three level of the CFA exam," says Wiley executive publisher of knowledge services, David Pugh.

Wiley already runs online CFA exam review courses, plus provides test preparation for the CPA, CMA, CIA and PMP designations.

Wiley's acquisition of AnalystSuccess is in line with wider dealmaker interest in e-learning programs. For more on the trend, see E-Training Services Entice Bidders.

The Hoboken, New Jersey-based buyer provides a spectrum of learning services, including digital and print scientific, technical, medical and scholarly journals, plus reference works, books, database services and advertising.

Wiley has made a slew of acquisitions. In 2014, it bought: SimBioSys, a scientific software; Cross Knowledge, a digital learning company; and Profiles International, a talent-assessment business.

Those acquisitions came after the business shed some book assets, including some non-fiction titles, which it sold to HarperCollins Canada, and certain general interest publishing assets, which it sold to Tuner Publishing. A few years ago Wiley also shed its culinary portfolio (including Webster's New World Dictionary) in a deal to Houghton Mifflin Harcourt's Trade & Reference division, and travel assets (including Frommer's), which were sold to Google Inc. (Nasdaq: GOOG).
