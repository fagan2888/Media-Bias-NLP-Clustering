We can call them the \u201c2014 Political Awards for Excellence,\u201d otherwise known as the \u201cPAE\u2019s\u201d, which also stands for the \u201cPhil and Ethan\u201d awards.\n\nabout the authors Phil Harriman is a former Republican state senator from Yarmouth. Ethan Strimling is a former Democratic state senator from Portland. They can be contacted on Facebook at Agree to Disagree or Twitter: @senpeh and @ethan6_2 Search photos available for purchase: Photo Store \u2192\n\nPhil: Perfect. No doubt, in years to come, these will be coveted by all within the political class.\n\nEthan: Ladies and gentleman, as determined by a blue-and-red-ribbon panel, consisting exclusively of the two of us, we present to you the top 10 awards for political excellence in 2014. *\n\nCampaign ad of the year\n\nWinner: \u201cNovember 4.\u201d The Republican Governor\u2019s Association wins for its closing ad for Gov. Paul LePage featuring Barbara Bush. This ad, targeted to seniors, softened his blustery side by having the former first lady exclaim, \u201cPaul is blunt. Direct. Like me.\u201d\n\nRunner-up: \u201cLead the Way.\u201d Sen. Susan Collins\u2019 team receives second place for its ad positioning Collins as a leader in brokering the agreement that reopened the federal government.\n\nComeback player of the year\n\nWinner: Bruce \u201cI\u2019m not dead yet\u201d Poliquin. After losing handily in two consecutive primaries, Poliquin came back to win a primary that he started out 20 points down to Kevin Raye, and then the general, in which he also started down by five.\n\nRunner-up: John \u201cI\u2019m also not dead yet\u201d Martin. Martin won his 24th term to the Maine Legislature despite having been ousted two years ago, stripped of his speakership 20 years ago and for whom term limit had passed.\n\nCampaign director of the year\n\nWinner: Brent Littlefield wins hands down, as he was the chief consultant to two winning races: Bruce Poliquin and Paul LePage.\n\nRunner-up: Matt McTighe receives second place for running a near flawless race for Mike Michaud, but simply coming up short in the final week.\n\nUpset of the year\n\nWinner: Rep. Terry Hayes. A former Democrat turned independent, Hayes defeated Democratic incumbent Neria Douglas in a race for treasurer where Democrats held the majority.\n\nRunner-up: Erik Brakey. Newcomer Republican Brakey defeated Democratic incumbent Sen. John Cleveland in a district where registered Democrats outnumber Republicans by more than 1,100 voters.\n\nBest new idea of the year\n\nWinner: The state should buy Verso. When the Bucksport mill announced it was closing, Eliot Cutler proposed that the state buy the energy plant to provide low-cost power to local businesses. Love it or hate it, this was the most creative and different idea to come out of the campaign season.\n\nRunner-up: Sophomore year free. In his Maine Made plan, Mike Michaud proposed making the second year of college free to all Maine students. Affordable or not, this idea addressed the problem of college students dropping out in a way not previously discussed.\n\nBest debate line\n\nWinner: \u201cEven a Frenchman can be taught to cool down.\u201d Gov. LePage, in the first debate, closed with this line, which helped soften the liability his temperament had become, while assuring the electorate that he was aware of the problem:\n\nRunner-up: \u201cTaking care of veterans is more than having ice cream socials at the Blaine House.\u201d Mike Michaud said this line to Gov. LePage in the final debate, creating a clear contrast between his deep record assisting veterans and what he saw as the LePage\u2019s thin record. It clearly got under LePage\u2019s skin as he tried to deflect the conversation to make it about his wife and not his record on veterans.\n\nWorst debate moment\n\nWinner: \u201cYou ought to listen to this, Mike, you might learn something.\u201d In the first televised debate, Eliot Cutler said this to Michaud. It was an unfortunate comment that fed Cutler\u2019s image as being arrogant, so much so that he went on WCSH the next night and apologized on live TV.\n\nRunner-up: \u201cFire Gov. LePage.\u201d In the same televised debate, Michaud responded with this line to a question asking about his top job-creating priority. Besides not making sense), it was a thin answer to an important question.\n\nHonorable mention: Cutler high-fiving Paul LePage in the first debate. While appearing innocent enough in the moment, it fed fears that Cutler was in cahoots with the governor.\n\nAgitator of the year\n\nWinner: Mike Tipping: Tipping, a no-holds-barred progressive working for the Maine People\u2019s Alliance, exposed Gov. LePage\u2019s meetings with militia groups, uncovered Rep. Larry Lockman\u2019s past comments on rape and the IRS and was generally a thorn in the side of conservatives.\n\nRunner-up: Steve Robinson: a no-holds-barred conservative working for the Maine Heritage Policy Center, Robinson didn\u2019t uncover anything dramatic \u2013 although he tried with a now-infamous secret recording \u2013 but he was a thorn in the side of Democrats with merciless, constant and biting attacks.\n\nBonehead play of the year\n\nWinner: Eliot Cutler\u2019s press conference announcing he was pulling out, but not really. This mistake didn\u2019t have much impact on the race this year, but it definitely hurt Cutler\u2019s reputation going forward. Ironically, had he simply pulled out, Cutler would have cemented his reputation as someone who sacrificed his own ambitions.\n\nRunner-up: John Tuttle covering $17,000 of personal expenses with funds from a PAC he set up to assist other Democrats. The expenditures, while not illegal, cost him his re-election.\n\nHonorable mention: Angus King endorsing Eliot Cutler in August, when it had already become apparent Cutler couldn\u2019t win, and then reversing course and endorsing Michaud in the final week.\n\nCourageous act of the year\n\nWinner: Mike Michaud for giving up a safe seat to run for governor and for publicly disclosing that he is gay. Regardless of whether you like his politics, these decisions were significant sacrifices politically and personally that had deep repercussions.\n\nRunner-up: Hampden Councilors Tom Brann and William Shakespeare, two U.S. veterans, who refused to stand for the Pledge of Allegiance at the beginning of council meetings because they felt it was being trivialized. Agree with them or not, they stood up, or sat down, for what they believed.\n\n* While we both agree with every awardee above, that does not mean we necessarily agree with the content or veracity. For instance, while we both believe that Michaud\u2019s idea making sophomore year free was the top new idea, Phil almost spit out his coffee when he first read it in Mike\u2019s \u201cMaine Made Plan.\u201d Likewise for Ethan in having to admit that Brent Littlefield, a man he lost to in a UMaine election, was our campaign director of the year.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Here's our 'Top 10'\u2028 of political highlights (and lowlights).", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "description": "Here's our 'Top 10'\u2028 of political highlights (and lowlights).", "title": "The Best of 2014, according to Phil and Ethan - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1000, "identifier": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/557377_193214-HighFive.jpg", "height": 677}, "updated_time": "2014-12-21T11:57:13-04:00", "url": "http://www.pressherald.com/2014/12/21/agree-to-disagree-the-best-of-2014-according-to-phil-and-ethan/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Here's our 'Top 10'\u2028 of political highlights (and lowlights).", "title": "The Best of 2014, according to Phil and Ethan - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "image": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/557377_193214-HighFive.jpg", "creator": "@pressherald", "site": "@pressherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=951845858", "fb": {"admins": 769488179, "app_id": 178078215650057}, "google-site-verification": "QWs9pxQP8fwo2-nR5mWopc6qCK2D3920f7bl-U-zkso", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pressherald", "section": "Agree to Disagree", "published_time": "2014-12-21T04:00:53-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-21T11:57:13-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde624\"", "article_summary": "In his Maine Made plan, Mike Michaud proposed making the second year of college free to all Maine students.\nCourageous act of the yearWinner: Mike Michaud for giving up a safe seat to run for governor and for publicly disclosing that he is gay.\nAgitator of the yearWinner: Mike Tipping: Tipping, a no-holds-barred progressive working for the Maine People\u2019s Alliance, exposed Gov.\nRunner-up: Matt McTighe receives second place for running a near flawless race for Mike Michaud, but simply coming up short in the final week.\nLePage.\u201d In the same televised debate, Michaud responded with this line to a question asking about his top job-creating priority."}
