He\u2019s not a household name. To the extent he is known, it\u2019s for running the politically unpopular federal bank bailout program. And he\u2019s the man many California Republicans are counting on to rescue their party. He is Neel Kashkari, a former U.S. Treasury official under Presidents Bush and Obama. And as of Tuesday, he\u2019s running for governor of California.\n\nNeel Kashkari is challenging a popular Democratic governor with a $17 million campaign war chest \u2013 as a Republican in one of the bluest states in the nation. Why?\n\n\u201cIf I saw a deep bench of talented Republicans who were going to do that, I\u2019d go help them,\" Kashkari said. \"But I don\u2019t see it. And so if no one else is gonna do it, then I\u2019m gonna go do it. I\u2019m gonna go charge up this hill and fight to turn the state around and give middle class families a fair chance \u2013 and we\u2019re gonna break the cycle of poverty.\u201d\n\nFull Interview, Part One\n\nWhy he's running, why he's qualified, his top two priorities and why he wants to go back into politics five years after leaving Washington exhausted\n\nThe 40-year-old Kashkari is a practicing Hindu, the son of Indian immigrants. As one of Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson\u2019s top advisors, Kashkari essentially wrote the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) during the 2008 financial crisis. Then, Paulson assigned him to run TARP \u2013 prompting nicknames like the \u201cBailout Czar\u201d and the \u201c$700 Billion Man.\u201d\n\nVideo: Clip from the 2011 HBO movie, Too Big Too Fail\n\nPaulson and his team, including Kashkari, discuss how to explain the financial meltdown to the public. Warning Explicit Language.\n\n\u201cBoundless energy, I think, would be the first phrase that comes to mind,\u201d said Michele Davis, who worked with Kashkari at Treasury as Secretary Paulson's lead spokesperson.\n\nDavis also described him as \u201crelentless,\u201d and praises his analytical skills, his passion and his cool confidence under pressure.\n\n\u201cWhen the problems were coming at us fast and furious, it was really easy to be daunted,\" said Davis. \"And he needed only that split-second to catch his breath and then was immediately on to, okay, we can take this on, we can figure it out, let\u2019s just go get it done.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with Capital Public Radio, Kashkari talked of running a new kind of Republican campaign.\n\n\u201cMy priorities are very simple: jobs and education,\" Kashkari said.\n\nOn jobs, Kashkari supports tax incentives and regulatory reform; for education: career technical programs and a longer school year. If you ask him, he\u2019ll tell you he\u2019s pro-immigration reform, pro-choice and pro-same-sex marriage. But he\u2019d rather stick to his priorities.\n\nAudio: Full Interview, Part Two\n\nKashkari's stances on California policy issues: taxes, regulations, prisons, immigration and more\n\n\u201cI believe my message of economic empowerment \u2013 a good job and a good education \u2013 will resonate with a very broad range of voters \u2013 Republicans, decline-to-states, moderate Democrats, high income and low income.\u201d\n\nTo Senate GOP Leader Bob Huff, that\u2019s the kind of top-of-the-ticket candidate his party needs as it tries to dethrone Democrats\u2019 legislative supermajorities.\n\n\u201cNeel brings a lot of things to the table that do capture the imagination probably of more of the mainstream of the \u2013 let\u2019s call it the political center of California \u2013 which, if you\u2019re at 29 percent registration as we are, that\u2019s where you have to aspire to,\" Huff said.\n\nThat\u2019s an unspoken comparison to the other declared Republican candidate, tea party Assemblyman Tim Donnelly.\n\nRepublican political consultant Beth Miller agrees Kashkari has a chance to broaden the GOP\u2019s appeal. But, she adds, Governor Jerry Brown starts the race in an \u201cextraordinarily strong\u201d position \u2013 and Kashkari faces plenty of challenges:\n\n\u201cHe is not well known. He\u2019s gonna have to communicate who he is. He\u2019s running as a Republican, but he\u2019s also publicly stated that he voted for Barack Obama. And he has a more moderate social agenda,\u201d Miller said.\n\nMost of all, there\u2019s TARP. Kashkari took beatings at congressional hearings like this one in 2008:\n\nAudio: Kashkari at congressional hearing\n\n\u201cAnd you can sit there and not come to a decision as to whether or not a $3 million bonus is too much?,\" said Rep. Donald Manzullo (R-Illinois), of TARP's executive compensation rules. \"If you even have to ask that question whether it's too much, Mr. Kashkari, you're not the man for the job. I think you should step aside.\u201d\n\nJerry Brown\u2019s team is signaling that it will make TARP a campaign issue too.\n\n\u201cHe was a banker at Goldman Sachs, and then his one public policy act was to hand $700 billion to Wall Street banks,\" said Dan Newman, one of the governor's political advisors. \"So it\u2019s hard to imagine how that makes one qualified to be governor of California.\u201d\n\nKashkari defends TARP, saying it stabilized an economy on the verge of collapse \u2013 and made taxpayers a profit, too.\n\nAudio: Full Interview, Part Three\n\nDefending TARP, why he voted for Pres. Obama in 2008, why he's a better candidate than Gov. Brown and Asm. Donnelly, and why the Calif. GOP needs a makeover\n\nBio Bits\n\n40 years old\n\nSon of Indian immigrants\n\nPracticing Hindu\n\nDivorced (2011)\n\nNo kids but two giant Newfoundlands dogs, Winslow and Newsome, who each have facebook & twitter accounts (watch out, Sutter Brown\u2026)\n\nLives in Laguna Beach, also owns a home in Truckee\n\nPositions\n\nJobs: Supports tax incentives and easing of regulations to attract and retain businesses and factories in California. Supports hydraulic fracturing (\"fracking\") - while protecting the environment - to \"literally\" create hundreds of thousands of \"good jobs.\"\n\nEducation: Wants to reduce federal and state \"rules and regulations\" that have Calif. teachers \"budgeting their time almost down to the minute\" and allow teachers to \"redesign the education environment so they're really meeting the needs of our kids.\" Supporter of vocational education (also known as career-technical education). Wants to explore extending school year into the summer to reduce achievement gap.\n\nTaxes: Will not sign \"No Tax\" pledge but believes California's taxes are \"too high\" and \"poorly designed.\" Supports \"comprehensive review\" of tax code to make it more efficient and growth-oriented. Voted no on Prop 30 (\"I don\u2019t think pouring more money into a broken system fixes anything\"), and called the idea suggested by some Republicans of refunding extra Prop 30 revenues to taxpayers \"very reasonable.\"\n\nPensions: Criticizes Gov. Brown for accepting CalPERS and CalSTRS \"unrealistic\" rate-of-return projections. Says state is \"ignoring the giant mortgage\" of unfunded pension liabilities \"and just patting ourselves on the back for balancing our checkbook [the state budget] this month.\"\n\nHigh-Speed Rail: Calls the \"crazy train\" the biggest example of \"wasted government spending\" and opposes investing any more money in it - including the sale of any remaining voter-approved state bonds.\n\nWater: Calls it a \"clear no-brainer\" that the state needs more water storage. Criticizes Gov. Brown for focusing on his twin tunnel proposal at the expense of all else, but declines to give a position on the proposal itself until he can review it further.\n\nPrisons: Criticizes Gov. Brown's criminal justice realignment program (the shift of responsibility for low-level offenders from the state to counties) as \"shuffling the deck chairs of the Titanic,\" rather than addressing the main problem. Supports rehabilitation efforts and sentencing reform to make state's prison system \"smarter and more efficient.\"\n\nHealth Care: Says it's \"appropriate\" for California to follow Obamacare, as it's \"the law of the land.\" Says U.S. can't go back to its old health care system. But Obamacare's \"fundamental flaws\" need \"big changes\" - or, if it's \"beyond fixing,\" then Congress should \"replace it with something better.\"\n\nImmigration: Supports immigration reform at federal level, rather than patchwork of state laws. Supports \"some form of legal status\" for undocumented immigrants so they pay taxes, but declined to say if he supports a path to citizenship. Wants to prioritize immigration system to meet economic needs (i.e. engineers in Silicon Valley, farm workers in Central Valley). Calls for enforcing immigration laws at the border and at companies.\n\nMinimum Wage: Calls new law raising California's minimum wage \"very well-intentioned\" but says it'll lead to increased unemployment.\n\nGuns: He is a gun owner who \"deeply believe(s) in the Second Amendment\" but wasn't inconvenienced \"in the slightest\" by going through background checks and waiting periods. Doesn't support additional gun laws for \"responsible gun owners like me\" that won't \"actually make our kids any safer.\" Wants to focus on \"root cause\" of recent school shootings by reforming state's mental health system.\n\nAbortion and Same-sex Marriage: Pro-choice and supports same-sex marriage. Voted against Prop 8. As a \"social libertarian,\" wants the government \"out of our lives.\"\n\nGlobal Warming: Believes it's real, but calls \"knee-jerk reactions\" to it \"misguided.\" Describes state's landmark greenhouse gas reduction bill (AB 32) as \"well-intentioned\" but worried about job losses and electricity cost increases hurting poor Californians. Supports technologies that are both clean and cheap enough.", "article_metadata": {"author": "Southern California Public Radio", "og": {"site_name": "Southern California Public Radio", "description": "He\u2019s been called the \u201cbailout czar\u201d and the \u201c$700 billion man.\u201d Now, Neel Kashkari is running for governor of California as a different kind of Republican.", "title": "Governor's race: TARP's Neel Kashkari wants to lead Calif.", "url": "http://www.scpr.org/news/2014/01/21/41719/tarp-s-700-billion-man-wants-to-lead-california/", "image": {"width": 1024, "identifier": "http://a.scpr.org/i/1c24f3a5d7f0d3052cdce79b1a4ce621/76443-full.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 701}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "http://scpr.org", "description": "Member-supported public radio for Southern California.
