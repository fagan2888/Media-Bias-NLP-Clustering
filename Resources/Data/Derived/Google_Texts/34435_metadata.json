The venue\u2019s owner has been charged with manslaughter after the deceased\u2019s daughter claimed that they not only supplied her father with the deadly amounts of liquor, but also egged him on to continue drinking. The case comes amid France\u2019s recent crackdown on its newly acquired binge-drinking problem.\n\nAs reported by The Local, last October the deceased, identified only as Renaud, and his daughter saw a sign outside the bar Le Starter, located in France's Clermont-Ferrand, advertising an alcohol drinking record of 55 shots. Tempted by the challenge, the man entered the bar and proceeded to drink 30 \u201cshooters\u201d consisting of various mixtures of hard alcohol equaling around a liter of hard liquor. Due to his level of intoxication, the man had to be carried home. Once home, the father shortly passed away of cardiac arrest.\n\nAccording to the daughter\u2019s testimony, the bar owner had pushed her father to continue drinking after he had finished his 30th shooter by saying \u201conly 12 to go.\u201d The family\u2019s lawyer claims it was a serious mistake for the bar owner to incite a patron to drink such copious amounts of liquor, Inquistr reported. Although it cannot be confirmed whether or not the deceased would have still been alive if he had not drank the last 12 shots, the family\u2019s lawyer, Antoine Portal, says that by drinking those last shots the deceased was left with no chance to find out.\n\nThe bar\u2019s owner tells a different story. While he admits that it was a mistake to have such a sign posted outside his venue, he claims he did in fact try to \u201ccut off\u201d the patron from continuing to drink.\n\n\u201cWhen you are the owner of a bar and an order has been placed, you cannot always verify who is drinking what. We cannot stand behind every customer. The customers are responsible for themselves as are their families and friends,\u201d the owner\u2019s attorney, Renaud Porejoie explained, as reported by Inquisitr.\n\nThe case has not yet gone to trial but comes amid the French government\u2019s attempts to curtail binge drinking, especially among youth. A French draft health bill could make encouraging minors to drink excessively punishable with up to a year in jail or a hefty fine. The draft also forbids the sale of products to minors inciting people to get drunk, such as T-shirts depicting drunkenness in a humorous manner, The Huffington Post reported.\n\nAlcohol has always been an important part of French culture and the country has some of the world\u2019s most lax laws pertaining to alcohol consumption in all of the world. However, binge-drinking or massive consumption of alcohol designed to cause intoxication in a minimum amount of time, is relatively new to France. The Washington Post reported that in only three years France has seen a 20 percent rise in hospital admissions for alcohol consumption, with the problem being more prominent in the younger generation.\n\nAdvocates for anti-binge drinking legislature believe that France\u2019s problem with the practice spawned from American and British traditions.\n\n\u201cWhereas once [the young French]would enjoy a glass of wine at family dinners, and drink coffee in cafes, [now] they see the excesses of their counterparts across [Britain] as something to emulate,\u201d Nabila Ramdani, a Parisian commentator on Anglo-French affairs, told The Guardian. \u201cAlcohol is associated with a glamorous, exciting life and the chance to express yourself.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "alcohol poisoning, alcoholism, intoxication", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A bar owner in France could face jail time after a man he egged on to keep drinking ultimately died of intoxication.", "title": "56 Shots Later, Bar Owner Held Responsible For Patron's Death", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/customer-fatally-binge-drinking-56-shots-leads-french-bar-owner-charged-manslaughter-332526", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/05/08/shots.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A bar owner in France could face jail time after a man he egged on to keep drinking ultimately died of intoxication.", "title": "56 Shots Later, Bar Owner Held Responsible For Patron's Death", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/customer-fatally-binge-drinking-56-shots-leads-french-bar-owner-charged-manslaughter-332526", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/05/08/shots.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/05/08/shots.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-05-08T12:32:45-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-08T12:32:44-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A bar owner in France could face jail time after a man he egged on to keep drinking ultimately died of intoxication."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbe78\"", "article_summary": "A 57-year-old French man died of cardiac arrest after consuming 56 shots of alcohol in an attempt to break a record.\n\u201cWhen you are the owner of a bar and an order has been placed, you cannot always verify who is drinking what.\nThe case has not yet gone to trial but comes amid the French government\u2019s attempts to curtail binge drinking, especially among youth.\nAdvocates for anti-binge drinking legislature believe that France\u2019s problem with the practice spawned from American and British traditions.\nAs reported by The Local, last October the deceased, identified only as Renaud, and his daughter saw a sign outside the bar Le Starter, located in France's Clermont-Ferrand, advertising an alcohol drinking record of 55 shots."}
