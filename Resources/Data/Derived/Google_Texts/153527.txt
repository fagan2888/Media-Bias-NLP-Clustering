Governor Pat McCrory took to national television on Sunday to explain his decision to sign House Bill 2, and his executive order to walk back parts of the so-called bathroom bill just three weeks later. In the nearly 10-minute interview on NBC’s “Meet the Press” McCrory told interviewer Chuck Todd:

HB2 was necessary to address “government overreach” by the city of Charlotte

“We need more dialogue, not threats.”

“I’m not the private sector’s HR director. I’m the HR director and governor of all state employees.”

“We’ve got to deal with this extremely new social norm that has come to our nation in a very quick period of time and have these discussions about the complexity of equality, while also balancing the concept of privacy.”

He did not meet with any transgendered people prior to signing HB2

On the Human Rights Campaign (HRC): “My gosh, they’re more powerful than the NRA.”

He favors repealing the one section of the bill that allows for the ability to sue in state court; the bathroom section of the bill affecting transgendered individuals is unlikely to change.

NBC estimates that North Carolina conservatively has lost $39.7 million since the governor signed the bill from businesses protesting the discriminatory legislation.

More than 160 leading CEOs and business leaders have signed an open letter urging Governor McCrory and the General Assembly to repeal bill in the upcoming short session.
