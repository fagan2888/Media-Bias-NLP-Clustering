Obama has since singled out other group practice health systems such as The Mayo Clinic for similar praise.\n\nCosgrove\u2019s book features the work of many Clinic physicians as examples of how the healthcare model fosters innovation, quality patient care, and a focus on outcomes rather than physician income.\n\nDr. Heather Gornik, a cardiologist who specializes in treating a rare blood vessel condition called fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD), is highlighted as an example of a doctor who isn\u2019t constrained by the fee-for-service model used by solo-practice physicians, and is therefore free to spend more time with her patients.\n\nThe late vascular surgeon Roy Greenberg, who passed away in December at the age of 49 after a battle with cancer, was also featured prominently in a chapter on innovation. Greenberg, who was focused on treating aortic aneurysms and held more than 50 patents, was the 2012 recipient of the Clinic\u2019s Sones Innovation award, which grants $50,000 to physicians and scientists for notable innovations.\n\nThere is only brief mention of the Affordable Care Act, to acknowledge what the CEO has said many times before\u2014that the impact of the healthcare legislation is still largely an unknown, and that hospitals will continue to have to \u201cdo far more with less.\u201d\n\nCosgrove does, however, remain optimistic.\n\n\u201cThe conversation has been that American healthcare is broken and we\u2019re in crisis, and that\u2019s been going on for some time,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy do people from all over the world who have the means come as fast as they can to the United States to get their healthcare? Because when it\u2019s good, it\u2019s at its best.\u201d\n\n\"For the Cleveland Clinic and the nation, I'm optimistic.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"article_author": "Brie Zeltner, The Plain Dealer", "medium": "news", "news_keywords": "affordable-care-act,cleveland-clinic-way,heather-gornik,roy-greenberg,toby-cosgrove", "title": "Cleveland Clinic CEO Toby Cosgrove publishes new book on future of nation's healthcare", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Cleveland Clinic CEO Toby Cosgrove publishes new book on future of nation\\u0027s healthcare\", \"link\": \"http://www.cleveland.com/healthfit/index.ssf/2014/01/cleveland_clinic_ceo_publishes.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.cleveland.com/home/cleve-media/width620/img/health_impact/photo/14062451-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"11960892\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-01-10T11:14:13Z\", \"author\": \"Brie Zeltner, The Plain Dealer\", \"tags\": [\"affordable-care-act\",\"cleveland-clinic-way\",\"heather-gornik\",\"roy-greenberg\",\"toby-cosgrove\"] }", "twitter": {"site": "@clevelanddotcom", "image": "http://media.cleveland.com/health_impact/photo/14062451-thumb_square_large.jpg", "description": "Cleveland Clinic CEO Toby Cosgrove's new book, \"The Cleveland Clinic Way\" is out today.", "card": "summary", "creator": "@briezeltner"}, "article_date_updated": "Friday, January 10, 2014,  6:14 AM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.cleveland.com/health_impact/photo/bookjacket-finaljpg-31a80d396092abe9.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"bzeltner\", \"author_nickname\": \"Brie Zeltner, The Plain Dealer\", \"author_id\": \"5262\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Health and Fitness\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.cleveland.com/healthfit/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "cleveland.com", "description": "Cleveland Clinic CEO Toby Cosgrove's new book, \"The Cleveland Clinic Way\" is out today.", "title": "Cleveland Clinic CEO Toby Cosgrove publishes new book on future of nation's healthcare", "url": "http://www.cleveland.com/healthfit/index.ssf/2014/01/cleveland_clinic_ceo_publishes.html", "image": "http://media.cleveland.com/design/alpha/img/logo_cleve.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "cleveland.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Friday, January 10, 2014,  6:00 AM", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "Description": "Cleveland Clinic CEO Toby Cosgrove's new book, \"The Cleveland Clinic Way\" is out today."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde59a\"", "article_summary": "CLEVELAND, Ohio-- Cleveland Clinic CEO Toby Cosgrove today released a book to address what the health system\u2019s leader refers to as \u201ca very negative national conversation\u201d about healthcare in the United States.\nBecause when it\u2019s good, it\u2019s at its best.\u201d\"For the Cleveland Clinic and the nation, I'm optimistic.\"\n\u201cAt its best, healthcare in the United States is the best in the world,\u201d Cosgrove said in a phone interview Thursday about the book, \u201cThe Cleveland Clinic Way,\" published by McGraw Hill Education.\nCosgrove\u2019s book features the work of many Clinic physicians as examples of how the healthcare model fosters innovation, quality patient care, and a focus on outcomes rather than physician income.\nIn 2009, President Barack Obama visited the Clinic, calling it a role model of healthcare delivery."}
