Malloy says the hospitals are getting rich off taxpayers, making more money now thanks, in part, to the Affordable Care Act. As he sees it, hospitals can afford to give some money back.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to not raise people\u2019s taxes, then you have to expect an industry that\u2019s making a billion dollars a year in your community to trim its sails,\" Malloy said recently on WNPR's Where We Live.\n\nBut if the governor sees bloat, the hospitals see a politician who\u2019s using them as easy targets. And they\u2019re paying for political-style advertising to say that his cuts will have real impact.\n\n\u201cThat means longer wait times, fewer cancer screenings, and nurses will be let go,\" said a man in one televised ad. \"Tell Gov. Malloy to stop cutting our hospital care. Lives depend on it.\u201d\n\nAt issue now is a tax implemented in 2012. The plan was that hospitals would pay around a few hundred million dollars a year to the state, and all \u2013 if not more \u2013 of that money would be returned to them as a mix of state and federal Medicaid money.\n\nBut that was then. Now, the state budget is out of balance, and Malloy wants to tax the hospitals even more -- and keep most of the money. That leaves people like Patrick Charmel in a bind. He\u2019s the CEO at Griffin Hospital, an independent non-profit in Derby.\n\n\u201cSo now...we\u2019re talking over half a billion dollars, over $500 million,\" Charmel said. \"So that\u2019s what hospitals are paying in, and, essentially, we\u2019re not getting any of that back.\u201d\n\nCharmel said that more cuts to funding will undoubtedly mean more cuts to services for those who need them most. And it\u2019s a policy dispute that could turn legal.\n\nThis week, the hospitals asked two state agencies to find the tax invalid -- a move they say could be followed by taking the tax itself to court.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health", "description": "Connecticut's hospitals are threatening to take the state to court over a hefty tax that amounts to hundreds of millions of dollars this year alone, and it", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://wnpr.org/post/connecticut-hospitals-angry-gov-malloy-pave-way-lawsuit", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wnpr/files/styles/medium/public/201507/hospital_room.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Connecticut's hospitals are threatening to take the state to court over a hefty tax that amounts to hundreds of millions of dollars this year alone, and it", "title": "Connecticut Hospitals, Angry at Gov.
