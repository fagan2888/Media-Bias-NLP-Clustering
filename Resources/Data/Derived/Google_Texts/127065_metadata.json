Perhaps you lost your job \u2013 and your health insurance with it.\n\nThese are some of life\u2019s common events that trigger special health insurance enrollment opportunities, which allow you to buy or switch plans outside of limited open enrollment periods.\n\nBut one common life event is missing from that list: Pregnancy.\n\nAttempts to add it this year have failed. At the same time, recent changes have expanded coverage options for some uninsured, pregnant Californians.\n\nQ: Do you know any solution to get health insurance now that my friend\u2019s wife is pregnant and there are no health plans accepting applications? For some reason, they say it\u2019s not a qualifying event.\n\nA: Jay of Rancho Cucamonga isn\u2019t alone in wondering why pregnancy doesn\u2019t trigger a special enrollment period for most commercial health insurance plans, whether purchased from the individual market or obtained from your employer.\n\nIn March, 37 Democratic U.S. Senators urged the secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to include pregnancy as a qualifying life event. Within days, California\u2019s two Democratic U.S. Senators, Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein, asked California\u2019s health insurance exchange, Covered California, to do the same. In the letter, they said that doing so could save lives and reduce health costs.\n\n\u201cEspecially since having a child is a qualifying life event, it makes sense to ensure that access to care is granted prior to birth,\u201d they wrote.\n\nHHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell responded in April that the department can\u2019t make pregnancy a qualifying life event because \u201cwe do not have the legal authority to\u201d do so.\n\n(Which of course raises the question of who does have the authority. I asked HHS, but the agency declined to comment further.)\n\nAs a result of Burwell\u2019s response, Covered California, too, said it couldn\u2019t make pregnancy a qualifying event.\n\nSo what options are available for women who get pregnant while uninsured?\n\nAfter all, nearly half of pregnancies are unintended, says Alina Salganicoff, director of Women\u2019s Health Policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nIn California, you may qualify for a publicly funded health program depending on your income. The thresholds can be relatively generous and include middle-income families.\n\nAnd as long as you\u2019re eligible, you can sign up anytime of year.\n\nThe first is Medi-Cal, which is the state\u2019s version of the federal Medicaid program for low-income residents. On Aug. 1, it increased the income limit for pregnant women to qualify for full-scope benefits to 138 percent of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL).\n\nThis year, that\u2019s up to roughly $22,000 for a family of two. (There\u2019s a twist here. I\u2019ll explain more below.)\n\nThe higher income threshold means that more pregnant women will qualify for comprehensive coverage, says Lucy Quacinella, a San Francisco attorney who advocates for health coverage options for working families.\n\n\u201cThey won\u2019t have to worry about whether something outside of a routine prenatal visit, like a referral to a specialist, will be covered,\u201d she says.\n\nPregnant women who make between 138 percent and 213 percent of FPL may qualify for Pregnancy-Related Medi-Cal.\n\nThis coverage includes \u201call medically necessary Medi-Cal services related to pregnancy and/or any complications that may pose a risk to the woman or her unborn child,\u201d says Tony Cava of the state Department of Health Care Services.\n\n(No matter how much their income is, pregnant women who are not in the country legally are not eligible for full Medi-Cal benefits. However, they are eligible for Pregnancy-Related Medi-Cal up to 213 percent of FPL, Quacinella says.)\n\nCoverage in full-scope Medi-Cal and Pregnancy-Related Medi-Cal is free for those who qualify.\n\nPlus, while you\u2019re waiting for your Medi-Cal application to be processed, there\u2019s a program called Presumptive Eligibility for Pregnant Women, which allows you to access temporary prenatal care. Call 800-824-0088 for more information.\n\nPregnant women who make between 213 percent and 322 percent of FPL (up to roughly $51,300 for a family of two), may qualify for different coverage called the Medi-Cal Access Program, formerly known as AIM.\n\nEarlier this year, the state removed the requirement that women sign up by their 30th week of gestation, allowing them to apply anytime during pregnancy, says Lynn Kersey, executive director of Maternal and Child Health Access.\n\nThis program costs 1.5 percent of annual household income (after some adjustments) but does not have deductibles or copayments.\n\nYou can apply for Medi-Cal or the Medi-Cal Access Program by visiting www.CoveredCA.com or by calling 800-300-1506. You can apply in person at your county human services office.\n\nNow, here\u2019s the twist: For Medi-Cal and the Medi-Cal Access Program, a pregnant woman counts not just as one person when calculating income, but one person plus the number of fetuses she\u2019s carrying.\n\n\u201cThat means you can make more money and still qualify for these programs,\u201d Kersey says.\n\nFor instance, a single mom who has one child and is expecting another would have a family size of three instead of two, which means she would be eligible for the Medi-Cal Access Program up to an annual income of nearly $65,000 instead of $51,300.\n\nIf you make too much money to qualify for these programs, you still have options.\n\nCommunity health clinics won\u2019t turn you away and offer care on a sliding-scale based on your income, Salganicoff says.\n\nTalk to your doctor and hospital (ask to speak with a medical social worker) to see if you can receive reduced-cost care or work out a payment plan, she adds.\n\nCheck with your county health agency to see what programs, if any, might be available to you, Kersey says. For instance, she says Los Angeles County offers some services.\n\nOpen-enrollment season is upon us. For Covered California and the open market, it starts Nov. 1 and ends Jan. 31, 2016.
