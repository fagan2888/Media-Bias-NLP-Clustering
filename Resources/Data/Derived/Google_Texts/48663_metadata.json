The prospect of adding 15 cents more \u2014 though it's relatively minor compared with the overall price increase \u2014 is daunting to many drivers. Assemblyman Henry T. Perea (D-Fresno) has introduced a bill to delay the extension of the law to transportation fuels for three additional years.\n\nThat won't do at all....The state must give drivers strong incentives to take fewer trips, carpool, use public transit and purchase electric or fuel-efficient vehicles. At the same time, state officials must remain sensitive to the effect a price increase will have on low-income and working-class Californians, especially those who commute long distances in areas where robust public transportation systems have not been built.\n\n....The best solution to this dilemma was proposed this year by Senate leader Darrell Steinberg: Rather than extending AB 32, impose a carbon tax on gasoline, at least for a transitional period. But make it revenue-neutral by giving the money back to taxpayers \u2014 and especially low-income taxpayers \u2014 through tax credits on the state's personal income tax.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "Mother Jones Magazine", "og": {"site_name": "Mother Jones", "description": "There's no good reason to muck with a cap-and-trade program that's working reasonably well.", "title": "Sacramento should leave AB32 alone", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2014/07/sacramento-should-leave-ab32-alone", "image": "/sites/all/assets/mojo_nomaster.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Sacramento should leave AB32 alone", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2014/07/sacramento-should-leave-ab32-alone", "image": {"src": "/sites/all/assets/mojo_nomaster.jpg", "identifier": "/sites/all/assets/mojo_nomaster.jpg"}, "creator": "kdrum", "site": "@MotherJones", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-310x150.png", "fb": {"admins": "13301307,670317733,1198876232,38509772,106892,2907757,306289,602422192,4101301,513450539"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "Climate+Change,Energy", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-150x150.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbcb9\"", "article_summary": "But make it revenue-neutral by giving the money back to taxpayers \u2014 and especially low-income taxpayers \u2014 through tax credits on the state's personal income tax.\nThe prospect of adding 15 cents more \u2014 though it's relatively minor compared with the overall price increase \u2014 is daunting to many drivers.\nAssemblyman Henry T.
