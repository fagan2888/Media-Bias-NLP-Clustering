But I might prefer President Trump,\" writes liberal columnist Ruth Marcus for the Washington Post in a piece declaring Texas Senator Ted Cruz \"more dangerous\" than the real estate mogul. Marcus argues that Trump would be far more likely to cut deals with Democrats \"on taxes, on funding Planned Parenthood, on implementing Obamacare, you name it.\" Cruz, by contrast, would die hard on such issues.\n\nMarcus offers an enlightening glimpse into the fears of the political establishment. Of particular note is this unexpected benefit of Trump's candidacy:\n\n... Trump\u2019s ascendancy and the outrageousness of his pronouncements have made Cruz appear like the more reasonable alternative. As Sen. Dean Heller (R-Nev.) told me in an interview for Washington Post Live, \u201cI don\u2019t think six months ago anybody would have thought that Ted Cruz was mainstream. . . . Trump has made Cruz mainstream.\u201d\n\nThat's one way to look at it. Perhaps the Republican Party will ultimately end up with a nominee other-than-Trump who Trump effectively enables.
