(AP) \u2014 Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam\u2019s suggestion this week that he may soon submit a proposal for Medicaid expansion in Tennessee received some blowback from a fellow Republican leader in the Legislature on Friday.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mark Norris, R-Collierville, issued a statement to question the Republican governor\u2019s suggestion that a proposal could crafted by this fall.\n\n\u201cIt seems the governor is not very serious about whatever he has in mind regarding Medicaid expansion, because he hasn\u2019t conferred with the General Assembly,\u201d Norris said.\n\nState lawmakers earlier this year passed a bill to require the governor to obtain legislative approval before he can expand Medicaid under President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law. Supporters dubbed the measure that Haslam later signed into law the \u201cStop Obamacare Act.\u201d\n\nPennsylvania on Thursday became the 27th state to agree to accept Medicaid expansion under the federal heath care law, and the ninth run by a Republican governor.\n\nHaslam told reporters on Thursday that he has begun talks with U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell, but acknowledged that any plan would require the support of a majority of state lawmakers in both chambers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice to say let\u2019s put politics aside, but at the end of the day you also have to get it passed in the Legislature,\u201d he said.\n\nHaslam has been heavily criticized by Democrats for refusing last year to take $1.4 billion in federal funds to cover about 180,000 uninsured Tennesseans under the terms the money was offered.\n\nThe governor has sought to negotiate a special deal for Tennessee that would allow the state to use the federal money to subsidize private insurance and promote healthier lifestyles through a series of incentives and to create a health provider payment system that stresses rewards for keeping patients healthy through preventative care and management of chronic illnesses.\n\nBut Haslam has declined so far to give specifics about what his plan would entail and earlier this year urged federal health officials to make a counterproposal that would be acceptable to both sides.\n\n\u201cThey never really came back with anything,\u201d Haslam said Thursday, prompting him to once again work on presenting his own plan with the advantage of knowing what has been approved and rejected in other states.\n\nHaslam said his proposal would involve something that \u201cfinancially works for the state long-term and \u2026 is something that we feel really does move health care ahead for everybody and doesn\u2019t just expand coverage.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Tennessee Gov.
