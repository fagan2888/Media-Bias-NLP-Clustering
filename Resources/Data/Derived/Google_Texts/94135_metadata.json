But in 1999 a difficult pregnancy derailed her job and her college plans. A few years later, she divorced her husband. He was \u201cstuck,\u201d she said\u2014stuck in the habits of the street life, in hopelessness. \u201cI couldn\u2019t be stuck.\u201d\n\nTamara moved back in with her mom in Oak Cliff. But the problems with drugs and gangs were so bad that she knew she had to try again to get out. \u201cA lot of kids were raising themselves there,\u201d she said, because so many parents were in jail or on drugs.\n\nShe applied and was approved for federal housing assistance, but the only units available were in Bonton, one of the most dangerous neighborhoods in the city. Bonton was built in the 1920s near the flood-prone Trinity River. Its most infamous landmark was the 1950s-era Turner Courts public housing development, so crime-ridden that buses wouldn\u2019t stop there after dark. Not long after Robertson lived there, Turner Courts would be demolished.\n\n\u201cDrug selling was out in the open,\u201d she said. Gangs were even more active than in her old neighborhood. \u201cIt was like, if I look at you wrong, you\u2019re going to shoot me.\u201d\n\nSome might have backed away, but Robertson didn\u2019t see a lot of alternatives. In Turner Courts, at least, she was in a building with mostly elderly neighbors, who looked after her and her son. \u201cNothing got past them,\u201d she said. \u201cIt might not be where I wanted to be, but it was a start. I could save my money, go to school. I wanted better for my son.\u201d\n\nThey lasted four months. Then, on an early summer day, she was outside her front door talking to a neighbor while her son, Lonzo, a preschooler, played with other children behind the building. She heard shots and kids screaming.\n\nTerrified, Robertson ran through her apartment and found Lonzo hiding behind the back door. In the yard, lying under her clothesline, was a man she\u2019d never seen before. Someone was still shooting, but other kids, inured to the sound of gunfire in the projects, had gone back to playing.\n\nAfter making sure her son was safe, Robertson ran to where the man lay dying from multiple gunshots. She dragged him away from her building and the other kids, then ran back inside. She and Lonzo lay on the floor and waited for police to arrive, talking with their neighbor through the thin wall between their units.\n\nWhen officers arrived, she told them what little she knew. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to know any more\u201d about what had happened or why, she said. She just knew she wanted out. She wanted a place where her son could grow up with better choices than which gang to join, with better chances for growing up at all.\n\nThese days, Robertson, a 37-year-old self-effacing woman who radiates calm, works three jobs to support a larger family\u2014three boys, plus a niece and her two children. They still get federal housing assistance. But they made it out.\n\nThe upscale suburb of Frisco is about 45 minutes north of Bonton, but it might as well be on the other side of the world. Robertson and her family live on a quiet street of one- and two-story brick houses with young trees in grassy front yards. The violent-crime rate in her new neighborhood, based on data compiled by NeighborhoodScout.com, is less than a quarter of what it is in Bonton; the median family income is four times as high, according to census data. At one end of the block there\u2019s a park with playgrounds and ballfields, and at the other a hike-and-bike trail that leads to a large pond. The kids are doing well in Frisco schools, and Robertson has earned her medical assistant certificate.\n\nThis peaceful, prosperous place is a battleground, though\u2014part of a war against racial segregation that a small Dallas nonprofit, the Inclusive Communities Project, and its lawyers have been fighting for decades. At its most basic, it\u2019s about getting people such as Robertson and her kids the chance to live in decent housing in decent neighborhoods. In a much larger sense, it\u2019s about reducing the kinds of economic and racial segregation that in the last year have so inflamed places such as Ferguson and Baltimore and contributed to racially motivated violence in Charleston, the burning of several black churches, even police misconduct at a teen pool party in McKinney.\n\nDuring that time, Texas has been the focus of two lawsuits that housing advocates say are possibly the most important desegregation actions to come along in years, both courtesy of the Inclusive Communities Project and the small law firm that represents it. Attorney Mike Daniel and his former law partner, Betsy Julian, now president of Inclusive Communities, have been at the center of groundbreaking civil rights work in North Texas for more than 30 years.\n\nThe Treasury case in particular has the potential to change the way affordable housing is done in every state, giving poor families the chance to live in towns and neighborhoods where they\u2019ve had little access\u2014and little welcome\u2014before.\n\nThe affordable housing struggle no longer centers on vouchers or big public housing projects for the poorest of the poor. Instead, it focuses on applying the anti-discrimination promises of the Fair Housing Act to low-income tax-credit housing, a major federal program in which developers receive tax breaks for building affordable residential developments. And the opponents are the most powerful that Inclusive Communities has ever faced.\n\nOn June 25, during the same two-day period when it issued momentous rulings on marriage equality and the Affordable Care Act, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of Inclusive Communities in its suit against the Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs (TDHCA).\n\nThat case, challenging Texas\u2019 system for deciding where to build tax-credit projects, is already changing the landscape of affordable housing in the state. The issue that brought the case before the Supreme Court was narrow but important: the legality of a widely used standard of proof for racial discrimination. The court, in an opinion delivered by Justice Anthony Kennedy, affirmed that \u201cdisparate impact\u201d\u2014the idea of proving racial discrimination in housing by results, without having to prove officials\u2019 racist intent\u2014is constitutional. Civil rights advocates all over the country cheered the decision. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, taking the side of those who don\u2019t want to see affordable housing in suburbs and white neighborhoods, vowed to fight on, though how that might happen isn\u2019t clear.\n\nUp next is a case with an even greater potential impact, but one that has drawn almost no attention. The Inclusive Communities Project is suing the IRS and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the two U. S. Treasury agencies that control the tax-credit housing program. The complaint is similar to the case against TDHCA: that the federal agencies are perpetuating racial segregation rather than trying to end it, as the Fair Housing Act requires.\n\nThe tax-credit program is the only one in the country that is adding new units of affordable housing, and it\u2019s huge\u2014more than 2.2 million units built in the last 30 years, at a cost of more than $6.5 billion in foregone taxes in 2012 alone. Its numerous critics charge that while it provides high-quality apartments, townhomes and houses, the program reinforces racial segregation by building most of those units in some of the worst neighborhoods in the country.\n\nA major industry has grown up around tax-credit housing. Some of the most powerful banks in the country have billions of dollars at stake, making them committed to maintaining the status quo. The Treasury case in particular has the potential to change the way affordable housing is done in every state, giving poor families the chance to live in towns and neighborhoods where they\u2019ve had little access\u2014and little welcome\u2014before. The Urban Institute reported in June that income inequality among American neighborhoods is increasing and that the Dallas area is the worst in the country. In May, Harvard economists released a study showing that growing up in neighborhoods with low-performing schools and high crime rates affects individuals\u2019 earning abilities for their whole lives.\n\nDaniel said that putting so much tax-credit housing into dicey neighborhoods means the program is forcing new residents into dangerous, blighted areas rather than helping them leave. Most of the people Robertson grew up with, she said, can\u2019t even imagine getting out of their old neighborhoods to places like North Dallas or Mesquite.\n\nRacially segregated neighborhoods are \u201cthe last line of defense in maintaining a segregated society,\u201d said Craig Flournoy, the former Dallas Morning News reporter whose investigation, with colleague George Rodrigue, into racial segregation in public housing won a Pulitzer Prize in 1986. Flournoy now teaches journalism at the University of Cincinnati and is board president of Inclusive Communities.\n\n\u201cI truly believe every societal problem in this country concerning race goes back to housing patterns,\u201d he said. \u201cUntil we address that, we will never be a post-racial society.\u201d\n\nIn 1979, Julian and Daniel were hired by East Texas Legal Services to represent black residents of public housing in that region. The properties were segregated by race, and the units occupied by blacks were in such awful condition that in at least one building the roof had fallen in. The lawsuit the two young lawyers filed in 1980 involved the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the state of Texas and dozens of local housing authorities. It led, eventually, to the most sweeping desegregation order ever handed down, covering public housing facilities in 36 counties. Streets got paved around formerly all-black projects, sewers were fixed, air conditioning was installed, facilities were integrated. But enforcing Judge William Wayne Justice\u2019s orders in the case took more than 20 years of continued litigation.\n\nIn the Dallas area, meanwhile, the pair was waging a long-term battle against racial segregation, from public housing placement to tactics that kept Section 8 vouchers from being used in white neighborhoods and suburbs. They went back to court when orders weren\u2019t carried out or new rules enforced. Sometimes, all that was needed to move a recalcitrant city or agency was the threat of a lawsuit. Julian left the law firm in 1988 and when the Inclusive Communities Project grew out of a major Dallas desegregation case in 2004, she became its executive director.\n\nAs the two were getting deeper into their work on public housing, Congress was setting up a program that would radically reshape affordable housing. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 gave developers tax breaks for building housing that could be offered at below-market rental rates. A few years later, Congress let the banks in on the act, allowing the tax credits to be sold to financial institutions. Texas is one of the largest recipients of the funding.\n\nTax-credit housing \u201cis a good product\u2014good for residents, good for communities,\u201d Julian said. The properties are usually fenced and gated and well-constructed.\n\nBut Julian, Daniel and other affordable-housing champions quickly discovered that most of the tax-credit complexes were being built in the same dead-end neighborhoods they\u2019d been trying to get people out of, places with hazardous waste sites and low-performing schools. Developers preferred run-down areas, where land is cheap and neighbors don\u2019t object. Plus, they could actually get extra tax credits or extra help from local banks for contributing to community revitalization efforts.\n\nFrom Julian and Daniel\u2019s point of view, the 1986 law began undoing progress they\u2019d worked hard for.\n\n\u201cFrom 1987 to 2008, they put 17,000 [tax-credit] units into predominantly minority areas we were trying to desegregate,\u201d Daniel said, which tripled the number of units in North Texas neighborhoods marked by slum and blight. \u201cMost of these areas were losing population\u2014those who could were getting out.\u201d\n\nTax credits helped build places such as Eban Village, an apartment complex that was built between 1997 and 2001 near Dallas\u2019 Fair Park. Today, the gated complex looks nice, with well-kept lawns and hedges surrounding trim brick-and-clapboard buildings that resemble the bungalow-style homes wealthy Jewish citizens built along nearby Park Row in the early 20th century. A community center, retail stores, small restaurants and public transportation are nearby.\n\nJust outside the gates, however, it becomes clear why the neighborhood is rated as deeply distressed. Run-down houses are common, and day drinkers hunker on a nearby corner.\n\nA large and lucrative industry has grown up around building and operating tax-credit housing. Myron Orfield, an influential demographer and law professor from Minnesota who has studied and written extensively on the subject, calls it the \u201cpoverty housing industry.\u201d Nonprofit organizations are often involved, but Orfield said they are usually just the \u201cfriendly face\u201d for the community, with the same for-profit builders, banks and investors ultimately benefitting.\n\nBanks are frequently willing to participate because it\u2019s easier to fulfill their community investment responsibilities than to make their loan programs more equitable, he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re a businessman and you don\u2019t care about ghetto-building in the inner cities, it makes a lot more sense,\u201d he said.\n\nSome of the biggest banks in the country are major players. Wells Fargo, Bank of America, J.P. Morgan and Citibank each invested about $300 million in tax-credit housing over a two-year period.\n\nJohn Henneberger, co-director of the nonprofit Texas Low Income Housing Information Service, said the same problem exists in many states. A 2013 study by the Fair Housing Justice Center found that almost three-fourths of tax-credit housing units for families in the New York City area were concentrated in high-poverty neighborhoods, while similar housing for the elderly\u2014occupied mostly by whites\u2014had been built mostly in higher-income suburbs.\n\n\u201cThere is overwhelming evidence in the social science community about the harm that comes to children who grow up in neighborhoods that have these extreme rates of poverty and violent crime,\u201d Henneberger said.\n\nNiketa Ramsey has seen the effect firsthand. A year ago, she and two of her children moved from Sunnyside to Sunnyvale\u2014that is, from Houston\u2019s high-crime (though gentrifying) Third Ward to a little upscale town east of Dallas and into a tax-credit-financed townhome built as a result of Inclusive Communities\u2019 relentless hammering on getting such housing into the suburbs.\n\nThe change \u201cdid wonders for me and my kids,\u201d who are both teenagers, she said. The schools are much better than in their old neighborhood, and her son\u2019s reading skills improved by two grade levels. There\u2019s more for them to do in the community, and they can play outside \u201cwithout me having to watch every minute.\u201d Ramsey is planning to apply to nursing school.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s peace,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI truly believe every societal problem in this country concerning race goes back to housing patterns,\u201d he said. \u201cUntil we address that, we will never be a post-racial society.\u201d\n\nRamsey, like Robertson, is an Inclusive Communities client. Besides its groundbreaking legal work, the nonprofit has a mobility program to help low-income families find housing outside of their old neighborhoods and assist with moving costs such as security deposits and fees.\n\nIn the Harvard study released in May, economists Raj Chetty and Nathaniel Hendren wrote that the effects on children of living in poor neighborhoods intensify over time, and are a major factor in long-term poverty. In their much-heralded work, the researchers concluded that getting out of such neighborhoods early on significantly improves children\u2019s chances of going to college and, for young women, reduces their chances of becoming single parents.\n\n\u201cThe evidence is mounting: It can be lifesaving for kids [to get out of bad neighborhoods]. You just can\u2019t keep holding people hostage to the idea of making it into a garden spot,\u201d Julian said. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t use hostages to fight wars.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe know you\u2019re going to screw it up for the rest of us.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s how Mike Daniel describes the view of his civil rights colleagues as he prepared to present the TDHCA case to the U.S. Supreme Court on Jan. 21. The civil rights community was terrified that Inclusive Communities was about to kill off something valuable to all of them, he said.\n\nIn a long career of fair housing and other civil rights cases, it was Daniel\u2019s first time to argue a case before the Supreme Court. At issue was the fate of disparate impact as a way to attack racial discrimination under the Fair Housing Act.\n\nThe court had agreed twice before to hear the issue, only to have the cases settled out of court\u2014civil rights advocates had been trying to keep the question out of the Supreme Court\u2019s purview for several years, fearing that the conservative lean of the court would mean a disastrous ruling. And now the Inclusive Communities case had thumped the theory down in front of the justices in a very public way.\n\n\u201cThe tension it caused everybody was horrible to watch,\u201d Daniel said. But even if he and Inclusive Communities had wanted to, there was no way they could have kept the Texas housing case from reaching the Supreme Court, not with Greg Abbott running for governor last year and boasting that suing the Obama administration was practically Job One for him.\n\nThe odd thing was that, well before Abbott\u2019s decision to appeal the 5th U.S. Circuit\u2019s ruling in the case, the Texas housing agency had already put into place the reforms that Inclusive Communities had sought.\n\nThat happened in 2012, after U.S. District Judge Sidney Fitzwater ruled that the agency had racially discriminated in choosing which tax-credit projects to fund. He required officials to file a plan to remedy the problem. The agency did so, revising its criteria on how to rate developments seeking federal tax-credit support. But instead of applying them only in the area covered by the Inclusive Communities suit, the agency voluntarily put the changes into effect statewide.\n\nBy the time of the January arguments, tax-credit housing had already begun to be built in places that had never welcomed affordable housing, including Sunnyvale (where Niketa Ramsey and her family live), Frisco and McKinney. True, in many cases the tax-credit housing was approved only with the help of an additional kick in the municipal pants from Inclusive Communities, via lawsuits or threats of same.\n\n\u201cTDHCA faced up to and solved the problem,\u201d Henneberger wrote recently. And yet Greg Abbott, as attorney general, \u201cmounted a misguided appeal to undo a half century of civil rights progress in fair housing.\u201d\n\nAbbott found plenty of allies, including the American Bankers Association and a long list of mortgage industry groups, all of which filed amicus briefs in the case, as did the Texas Apartment Association.\n\nOn the other side, once it was clear the TDHCA case wasn\u2019t going away, the civil rights community eventually closed ranks to support Inclusive Communities and disparate impact. In addition to major civil rights groups, 17 states, a prestigious group of more than 60 housing scholars, and a long list of cities filed briefs on behalf of Inclusive Communities\u2014a fact Kennedy noted in his majority opinion.\n\nDaniel, his current law partner Laura Beshara, and the Inclusive Communities leaders had decided that they would put the heart of the Fair Housing Act\u2014its goal of eliminating racial discrimination in housing\u2014at the center of their brief.\n\n\u201cIf we were going to go down, we were going down on our own terms,\u201d Julian said. During arguments, civil rights advocates saw some reason for hope in the justices\u2019 questions. But Daniel and Julian were pessimistic all spring, waiting for the court\u2019s decision and working on the Treasury case.\n\nIf the federal government isn\u2019t going to aggressively enforce the requirements of the Fair Housing Act on others, shouldn\u2019t it at least stop segregation in its own programs?That\u2019s the question Julian has been asking for decades, and it\u2019s one that inevitably led Inclusive Communities to sue the IRS and OCC. While many housing desegregation lawsuits have taken on states and cities and HUD, nobody until now has gone after the Treasury agencies. As in the TDHCA case, Inclusive Communities alleges that the Treasury agencies have allowed the tax-credit housing program to aggravate racial segregation in the Dallas area rather than alleviate it.\n\nThe IRS administers the tax-credit housing program while OCC oversees the banks. National banks are allowed to invest in real estate only if the project is deemed to be promoting the public welfare. OCC has to sign off on that in order for banks to be able to take part in the lucrative business of trading tax credits and otherwise making money off of the housing properties.\n\n\u201cThey like to say it\u2019s a tax program,\u201d Julian said. \u201cWell, it\u2019s a housing program.\u201d In fact, it\u2019s the largest affordable-housing program in the country. Nonetheless, neither Treasury agency has ever written any regulations to prevent or deal with racial segregation in the program. When groups such as Inclusive Communities sue states and local governments for using the tax-credit money in a way that promotes segregation, they can\u2019t point to any federal regulation that\u2019s not being followed.\n\nWhat they can use is the Fair Housing Act, which requires that agencies \u201caffirmatively further\u201d fair housing by eliminating racial segregation in housing programs.\n\nThe tax-credit housing program, Daniel said, was created \u201cwith a lot of high ideals\u201d about promoting public welfare by making affordable housing also profitable for builders. Now, rather than any detailed showing of how a proposed project will benefit the public welfare, he said, there\u2019s just a one-page form to submit.\n\nWhen Barack Obama was elected president, Inclusive Communities started nudging the Treasury to develop regulations to enforce Fair Housing Act standards in the tax-credit program. But it hasn\u2019t happened.\n\n\u201cThey talked and talked and talked,\u201d Julian said. \u201cI believe Treasury has no intention of doing anything until they are forced to. They are incredibly arrogant \u2026 [and] certainly heavily influenced by the industries they regulate.\u201d\n\nLately, Obama seems to have moved closer to Inclusive Communities\u2019 position, devoting one of his weekly radio addresses to the topic of fair housing. \u201cThe work of the Fair Housing Act remains unfinished,\u201d he said. Referring to the disparate impact ruling, the president said the Supreme Court had acknowledged that \u201ctoo often, where people live determines what opportunities they have in life.\u201d In June, his administration released new rules aimed at reducing segregation in federally supported housing. However, the rules focus on improving local accountability rather than addressing Treasury\u2019s actions.\n\nInclusive Communities\u2019 case against the Treasury agencies is Dallas-based, and the nonprofit is asking for Dallas remedies. But if the courts rule that the IRS and OCC \u201chave to stop allocating housing in areas of slum and blight, then it will have an impact nationally,\u201d Julian said. \u201cThat is why everyone is hysterical.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t begrudge people making money,\u201d she said. But tax-credit housing \u201cis a very rich program. And it is serving a lot of people before it serves poor people.\u201d\n\nJill Khadduri of Abt Associates, a former HUD executive, has argued that there needs to be a better balance of tax-credit units in poor neighborhoods and in so-called high opportunity areas\u2014that is, middle-class neighborhoods. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t been so much a question of deliberate segregation as missed opportunity,\u201d she said.\n\nMark Shelburne, a senior manager at Novogradac & Company, is a consultant to government agencies, builders and others on tax-credit housing. He is skeptical of claims that the program has added to urban blight and racial segregation. But he does agree that the Inclusive Communities suit could have \u201chuge consequences for the tax-credit industry.\u201d\n\nDespite that, he said, \u201cbankers mostly don\u2019t know about the [Treasury] suit. The fact is, it\u2019s the same plaintiffs, the same judge, a lot of the same facts [as in the TDHCA suit]. And who\u2019s to say there will be a different outcome? So far, Inclusive Communities is winning.\u201d\n\nKennedy, in the majority opinion in the TDHCA case, wrote that government-backed segregation by race \u201cwas declared unconstitutional almost a century ago, but its vestiges remain today, intertwined with the country\u2019s economic and social life.\u201d\n\nRichard Rothstein, a researcher with the Berkeley law school and the Economic Policy Institute, takes a much more cynical view. In an article in the American Bar Association\u2019s Human Rights Magazine, he argued that racial segregation in urban America, at least since the 1930s, has been strengthened, if not created outright, by the federal government, through mortgage discrimination, rules barring blacks from many developments, and programs aimed at moving white families to the suburbs. But at least as late as 2007, he wrote, the Supreme Court was acting as though racial segregation was, in effect, just something that happened.\n\n\u201cThere is overwhelming evidence in the social science community about the harm that comes to children who grow up in neighborhoods that have these extreme rates of poverty and violent crime.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising that the justices were ill informed, he stated. \u201cWe suffer from collective amnesia about racial history, comforting ourselves that Jim Crow was restricted to Southern states with blunt racial legislation,\u201d he wrote.\n\nTexas officials didn\u2019t exhibit the visceral reaction to the decision on housing equality that they showed with the court ruling on marriage equality. The case is \u201cfar from over,\u201d Paxton stated in a release. He also wrote that the housing agency\u2019s decisions on doling out tax-credit housing money were made with the \u201clegitimate objective of revitalizing neighborhoods.\u201d Julian and Inclusive Communities aren\u2019t trying to prevent all units from being placed as part of a redevelopment of bad neighborhoods; they\u2019re just trying to get some of them into the suburbs and good neighborhoods as well.\n\nTim Irvine, executive director of the TDHCA, did not agree to an interview, but in a statement provided to the media after the decision, he said his agency \u201cremains committed to its mission of providing affordable housing options to low-income Texans.\u201d\n\nWhether the TDHCA case is over seems to be up to Fitzwater, the district court judge. The Supreme Court let stand the 5th Circuit\u2019s decision to send the case back to the trial court judge to reconsider some points. But the justices didn\u2019t order up a retrial or any particular action at all\u2014they left that to Fitzwater.\n\nAt this point, Daniel said, Texas is now in the forefront of states trying to spread the wealth of low-income housing opportunities to better neighborhoods. \u201cSad to say, it doesn\u2019t take much\u201d to lead that pack, he said.\n\nBecause of Inclusive Communities\u2019 fight, Henneberger said, \u201cproperties actually being funded today are largely in neighborhoods where a reasonable person might want to live.\u201d\n\nTamara Robertson is trying to make sure her kids get the full story. She takes them to visit her mom, back in a rough part of Dallas, so they can see what it\u2019s like. \u201cI get so excited. I feel like I\u2019ve been coming such a long way,\u201d she said. When Lonzo graduates from high school in two years, she said, she\u2019s going to get off housing assistance and go back to college, even if she has to take a fourth job to make it happen.\n\nOrfield, the Minnesota housing scholar, said that if Inclusive Communities wins the Treasury case, \u201cwe will see more affordable housing throughout the country in whiter areas.\u201d\n\nThe connection between desegregating American communities and tragedies such as the police shootings in Ferguson and Baltimore is an important one, Orfield said. \u201cPlaces that have really integrated schools and affordable housing in the \u2019burbs don\u2019t have these problems.\n\n\u201cIf you create big ghettos, you are going to have Fergusons\u2014farther from employment and closer to prison,\u201d he said.
