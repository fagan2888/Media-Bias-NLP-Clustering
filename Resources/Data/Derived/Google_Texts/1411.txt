BRUSSELS (AP) — The Latest on the arrests in Belgium of suspects related to the Paris and Brussels attacks (all times local):

5:50 p.m.

Two Paris police officials have confirmed that a key suspect in the Nov. 13 attacks in Paris has been arrested in Belgium.

The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak about the Belgian investigation, confirmed the arrest Friday of the last identified fugitive in the Paris attacks, Mohamed Abrini.

The Belgian federal prosecutor's office said Friday it had made "several arrests" linked to the March 22 attacks, but did not name Abrini, who has never been called a suspect in the Brussels bloodshed.

Abrini's suspected role in the Paris attacks has never been made clear. He was seen in the attack convoy en route to Paris in the days ahead of the bloodshed, but disappeared afterward.

One of the French police officials said Abrini is believed to be the man in the hat who was last seen leaving the Brussels airport after the double explosion there.

Belgian authorities say several arrests have been made in relation to the Brussels attacks.

The prosecutor's office said Friday it made "several arrests" Friday, one day after it called on the public to help look for a key suspect in the March 22 attacks that killed 32 people.

The prosecutor's office refused to provide more information.

Belgian broadcaster VRT, citing sources it did not identify, said Paris attacks suspect Mohamed Abrini was among those arrested.
