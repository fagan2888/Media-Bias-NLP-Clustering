Economic downturn, plus cuts to the amount of money doctors receive when they treat patients on Medicare, and the increased cost of treating uninsured patients in past years, have caused some hospital closures. The Douglas hospital is attempting to emerge from a bankruptcy filling, said Jim Dickson, CEO of the Copper Queen Hospital in Bisbee.\n\nA few years ago, the hospital started a new ER model where some patients who can be fast tracked through the care system are seen and released quickly. That increased the number of patients, which necessitated an emergency room expansion, Dickson said.\n\n\u201cIt turned out to be such a good service, 7 minutes to a doctor, out in less than 2 hours, that our demand has tripled so we needed to build a new space to be able to provide the service to the growing demand that we\u2019ve seen,\" he said.\n\nA $4 million loan from the U.S. Department of Agriculture paid for the expansion, and the hospital has 40 years to pay that money back. New equipment was paid for with a grant from the federal government, he said.\n\nThe Copper Queen is not the only emergency room south of Tucson, but it treats people from other Southern Arizona communities, such as Sierra Vista and Douglas.\n\nMore people are seeing doctors now, Dickson said, because of the requirement in the Affordable Care Act that all residents have health insurance or pay a fine against this year's taxes.\n\n\"They\u2019re utilizing the ER as their place for health care because they do not have a primary care doctor,\" he said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "https://www.azpm.org/s/18367-copper-queen-hospital-in-bisbee-expands-emergency-care", "image": "https://media.azpm.org/intensifier/img/banner/azpm-card-black.png", "description": "Larger ER will accommodate increase in people going to doctor now that they have federally-mandated health insurance.", "title": "Copper Queen Hospital in Bisbee Expands Emergency Care"}, "MSSmartTagsPreventParsing": "true", "Copyright": "Arizona Public Media, 2007-2012"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd44e2\"", "article_summary": "PHOTO: John Charley, Copper Queen Community Hospital Copper Queen Community Hospital in Bisbee, Ariz.\nThe Douglas hospital is attempting to emerge from a bankruptcy filling, said Jim Dickson, CEO of the Copper Queen Hospital in Bisbee.\nPHOTO: AZPM Staff Jim Dickson, CEO of Copper Queen Community Hospital in Bisbee, Ariz.Several Southern Arizona hospitals have struggled during the recession.\nThe Copper Queen is not the only emergency room south of Tucson, but it treats people from other Southern Arizona communities, such as Sierra Vista and Douglas.\nListen:Media Player ErrorUpdate your browser or Flash pluginThe hospital in Bisbee opened an expanded emergency room Friday to serve more patients in southern Arizona, including Sierra Vista and Douglas."}
