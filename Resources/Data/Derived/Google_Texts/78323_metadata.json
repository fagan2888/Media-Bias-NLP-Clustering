I now have a 50-50 chance of survival,\u201d she said of hitting the five-year mark. \u201cThat\u2019s huge after the 33 percent.\u201d\n\nThe letter she wrote to the president now hangs in the Oval Office and she herself has had the opportunity to travel to Washington D.C. to see it, something that seemed unimaginable five years ago as she fought the cancer again.\n\n\u201cI never thought this would happen, this is wonderful beyond belief, but I didn\u2019t think it would come to pass,\u201d she said.\n\nFive years later she still gets letters from some of the 16 million Americans now insured because of the ACA, including more than 700,000 Ohioans, many like Natoma, enrolled in the state\u2019s Medicaid program.\n\n\u201cI have strangers in Medina come up and say how this has helped them, how they didn\u2019t want it but yet they found out how good it is,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was a long, long five years and yet I\u2019m so happy that things have worked out the way they have.\u201d\n\n---\n\nFollow John Kosich on Facebook and Twitter\n\nFollow @KosichJohn", "article_metadata": {"isStory": "true", "isPremium": "false", "description": "Natoma Canfield became the face of the president's Affordable Care Act push in 2010, five years later she marks the anniversary of its passing for a different reason, it marks for her five years...", "author": "John Kosich", "og": {"site_name": "newsnet5", "description": "Natoma Canfield became the face of the president's Affordable Care Act push in 2010, five years later she marks the anniversary of its passing for a different reason, it marks for her five years cancer free.", "title": "As Obamacare turns 5, Medina woman behind the ACA push marks the anniversary for a different reasons", "url": "http://www.newsnet5.com/news/local-news/oh-medina/as-obamacare-turns-5-medina-woman-behind-the-aca-push-marks-the-anniversary-for-a-different-reasons", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media2.newsnet5.com/photo/2015/03/23/natoma_1427153600159_15434550_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "height": 480}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"app": {"id": {"ipad": 481449100, "iphone": 487296004}}, "site": "@wews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "shortHeadline": "Natoma Canfield celebrates 5 years cancer free", "com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages03.net,scripps.mkt7057.com,www.newsnet5.com,recp.mkt32.net", "hasVideo": "true", "fb": {"app_id": 117981068372285}, "idio": {"hasVideo": "true", "isPremium": "false", "author": "John Kosich"}, "keywords": "medina,OH Medina,Homepage Showcase,Mobile Showcase,News,Local News", "google-site-verification": "DiabNvdHVXRDa2QCnoOOtjKaIvq8CtH1446fPeFerd0", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/WEWS5", "published_time": "2015-03-24T03:31:21+0000", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/", "section": "OH Medina", "modified_time": "2015-03-24T03:31:21+0000", "tag": "medina"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, target-densitydpi=device-dpi, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd32c7\"", "article_summary": "MEDINA, Ohio - Five years ago, Medina\u2019s Natoma Canfield became the face of President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act push.\nFive years later, Canfield is marking the ACA\u2019s anniversary for a different reason, she\u2019s five years cancer free.\nA week later Canfield collapsed, her cancer was back.\n\u201cShe was very sick, she needed two blood transfusions,\u201d President Obama told a crowd in Strongsville that week in 2010.\nThe president not only wrote Canfield back, but took the letter with him and read it to a group of health insurance executives during a meeting at the White House."}
