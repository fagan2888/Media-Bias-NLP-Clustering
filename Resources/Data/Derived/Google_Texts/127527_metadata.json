We believe that the safest approach for the world is to encrypt end-to-end with no backdoor. We think that protects the most people.\"\n\nAccording to data outlined in Vance\u2019s paper, encryption on Apple devices running iOS 8 stymied as many as 111 prosecutions in his office over a 12-month period. The charges were for crimes like homicide, attempted murder, sexual abuse of a child, sex trafficking, assault and robbery, the paper says.\n\nThe encryption on Apple devices running iOS 8 or later is so strong that the company itself says it cannot de-encrypt a given user\u2019s phone.\n\nVance insists that his report is only calling for a return to the status quo before the release of Apple\u2019s iOS 8 and Android\u2019s Lollipop 5.0, which offers a similar level of protection.\n\n\u201cThis paper does not propose any new technology, nor does it propose that governments hold a key to smartphones,\u201d Vance\u2019s paper reads. \u201cIt proposes an arrangement that worked without any significant, documented security problems before iOS 8 and Lollipop 5.0.\u201d\n\nApple has complained that routinely helping law enforcement to decrypt data would be an unduly onerous tax on its resources.\n\n\u201cThis burden increases as the number of government requests increases,\u201d it argued in a recent legal brief.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Vance says his proposal is not the same as a \"backdoor.\"", "description": "Vance says his proposal is not the same as a \"backdoor.\"", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Katie Bo Williams", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Vance says his proposal is not the same as a \"backdoor.\"", "title": "Manhattan DA: Congress should require tech companies to decrypt phones", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/260674-manhattan-da-congress-should-require-tech-companies-to-decrypt-phones", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T05:25-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/260674-manhattan-da-congress-should-require-tech-companies-to-decrypt-phones", "dcterms.date": "2015-11-18T17:50-05:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Katie Bo Williams", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-18T17:50:13-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/260674-manhattan-da-congress-should-require-tech-companies-to-decrypt-phones", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Vance says his proposal is not the same as a \"backdoor.\"", "card": "summary", "title": "Manhattan DA: Congress should require tech companies to decrypt phones"}, "dcterms.title": "Manhattan DA: Congress should require tech companies to decrypt phones"}, "article_summary": "Manhattan district attorney Cyrus Vance on Wednesday released a paper calling on Congress to require that tech companies make encrypted data accessible to government searches.\n\u201cThis paper does not propose any new technology, nor does it propose that governments hold a key to smartphones,\u201d Vance\u2019s paper reads.\nAccording to data outlined in Vance\u2019s paper, encryption on Apple devices running iOS 8 stymied as many as 111 prosecutions in his office over a 12-month period.\nPrivacy advocates and technologists say that undermining encryption \u2014 building a so-called backdoor for authorities \u2014 undermines overall security and infringes on individual privacy.\nThe encryption on Apple devices running iOS 8 or later is so strong that the company itself says it cannot de-encrypt a given user\u2019s phone."}
