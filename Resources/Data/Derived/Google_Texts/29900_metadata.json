There\u2019s nothing particularly new there to dislodge people\u2019s feelings on those matters one way or the other. And most of the responses have been focused on \u201celectoral nihilism\u201d of the piece, and the various other implications about electoral strategy and grassroots energy.\n\nThough there are many reasons why there is no liberal Tea Party beyond the disappointments of individual politicians and lack of a labor movement, Reed\u2019s other point that liberals focus too much on elections and less on ideology is correct. As New America's Michael Lind, a former neoconservative before he became a heterodox liberal in the early 1990s, told me, \"many of the original neoconservatives were ex-Trotskyites. They knew you fight over your principles first, then purge from the movement those who fundamentally disagree, and only then fight over electoral strategies.\" However liberals, according to Lind, fight over electoral strategies first, and hope somehow their first principles will fall out of all that action and energy somehow.\n\nBut Reed is making an argument that goes beyond the current Democratic Party, and there are three points worth exploring further.\n\nReed: \u201cWith the two parties converging in policy\u2026\u201d\n\nThis is the kind of stuff that drives liberals up the wall, and for good reason. The two parties at this point are pushing two very different, ideological visions of the role of the state and the market. Ignore, for a second, cuts and expansions. Conservatives want to privatize Social Security, while liberals want it to remain a public program. Conservatives want to turn Medicare into a coupon to buy health insurance on exchanges, while liberals want to use Medicare\u2019s footprint to control health-care costs. Liberals see a greater role for the federal government, for instance in absorbing the costs of a major expansion of Medicaid. Conservatives want to turn everything over to the states where it will be easier to starve and replace with private control. These aren\u2019t minor differences.\n\nThese battles are clearer if you look at the fighting in the states. States taken over by conservatives have waged an all-out war on workers, reproductive health, and public goods. Meanwhile liberal states and cities have moved to expand paid sick-leave, minimum wages, and reproductive health. Even the so-called culture wars have a hard economic edge. Reed dismisses feminism as a set of fake cultural politics. Yet health-care reform has eliminated \u201cwoman\u201d as a pre-existing condition, and minimum wage hikes, which disproportionately benefit women of color, and equal pay are in the forefront.\n\nReed: \u201c...what can it mean to be on the political left? The terms \u2018left\u2019 and \u2018progressive\u2019...now signify a cultural sensibility...The left has no particular place it wants to go.\u201d\n\nInequality is shaping up to become the new focus of liberals. Reed is worried about the \u201cdilettantish\u201d behavior of the left which \u201ccareens from this oppressed group or crisis moment to that one.\u201d And yes, inequality could turn into another bright shiny object of the day. But I believe inequality will have legs. It has enough moral energy to coordinate political imaginations, yet it\u2019s plastic enough to cover different elements like poverty and plutocracy, as well as values like economic freedom and security.\n\nThere\u2019s certainly room. So much liberal energy, both through infrastructure and as a matter of the political horizon, was focused on passing health-care reform and completing the social insurance project. Much of the centrist energy is on the defense or otherwise in decline. Inequality can fill the gap.\n\nThis will create its own challenges. It\u2019s not clear inequality as a political project can challenge some of the more egregious blind spots of where Democrats are right now. Questions of worker power and privatization of public goods are left underdetermined in the framework of inequality. Full employment and the actual management of the business cycle can disappear in this focus. However, if done well, inequality can be used to open up these discussions in a progressive way.\n\nBut here Reed\u2019s evocation of \u201cthe left\u201d becomes problematic. Inequality as a political project will be a distinctly liberal project, focused on a mixed economy, social insurance, and the ways law and custom structure markets and distributions. These are not radical sentiments as the term is historically understood.\n\nThis is a total clich\u00e9, but it remains the case: After the \u201cEnd of History\u201d it\u2019s not clear what will animate genuinely leftist politics. Where liberals have been mildly emboldened by the economic crisis, actual leftists continue to seem lost, unable to turn the middle of the plate pitch of a global financial crisis to their advantage. (It\u2019s noteworthy that the recent, big, standard-setting Marx biography is predicated on the idea that trying to read our economic times through Marx is a \u201csingularly useless pastime\u201d that \u201chas run its course.\u201d)\n\nI see new strands focused on the politics of creating alternative spaces and institutions, notably in much of the work and thought central to Occupy. Others are focusing on regrounding leftist politics in a critical re-engagement of work itself. I don\u2019t see a convergence however. The question could use more engagement, including from Reed himself.\n\nReed: \u201c....the areas of fundamental disagreements that separate [the two parties] become too arcane and too remote from most people\u2019s experience to inspire any commitment, much less popular action.\u201d\n\nNo. Just a casual glance out the window shows that the differences in policy have created massive popular actions. From the Tea Party organizing against expanding access to health-care and efforts to fight the recession, to undocumented workers organizing to pass immigration reform, the actual differences in play get people on the street.\n\nThere\u2019s a genuine issue here for liberals. One positive thing that the New Republic saw in the New Deal back in 1940 was the idea that the changes in social insurance and labor laws were self-enforcing, and that \u201cit is improbable that these more permanent changes will be or even can be destroyed by any new administration.\u201d (They were half-right; labor was decimated seven years later under Taft-Hartley.)\n\nBut can new liberal reform, in an age of diminished horizons, sustain itself? Concretely, will the people getting health-care through the exchanges stand up and prevent future dismantling of Obamacare, the way this is the case with Social Security and Medicare? Can the minor, and even major, changes that would come with an inequality agenda build an actual democratic politics that would call for more action? I\u2019m not sure. But it\u2019s worth finding out, because the potential for the inequality agenda is worth fighting for.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Left-wing naivete about right-wing radicalism", "og": {"site_name": "New Republic", "description": "A new Harper's essay attacks Obama from the left\u2014and is incoherent about the vast gap between liberals and conservatives", "title": "Lefties: Please Stop Being so Naive About GOP Radicalism", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/f5016991a3e13ef96e7cc0969315d5ad60c6da38.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "url": "https://newrepublic.com/article/116962/adolph-reeds-harpers-essay-about-obama-naive-about-tea-party", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/f5016991a3e13ef96e7cc0969315d5ad60c6da38.jpeg?w=1024&h=512&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "title": "Lefties: Please Stop Being so Naive About GOP Radicalism", "description": "A new Harper's essay attacks Obama from the left\u2014and is incoherent about the vast gap between liberals and conservatives", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@newrepublic"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "parsely-metadata": "{\"thumb_image\":\"http://images.newrepublic.com/f5016991a3e13ef96e7cc0969315d5ad60c6da38.jpeg\"}", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"An Incoherent Harper's Essay Suggests There's No Difference Between Obama and Republicans\",\"link\":\"https://newrepublic.com/article/116962/adolph-reeds-harpers-essay-about-obama-naive-about-tea-party\",\"section\":\"Liberalism\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-03-12T18:23:10.000Z\",\"post_id\":116962,\"author\":\"Mike Konczal\",\"type\":\"post\",\"tags\":[\"Liberalism\",\"Politics\",\"Obama\",\"Left-wing\",\"Tea Party\",\"Adolph Reed\",\"-type_article\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 4404589, "pages": 161419311535, "app_id": 1675346479369918}, "msapplication-TileImage": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thenewrepublic", "tag": "Liberalism", "published_time": "2014-03-12"}, "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8d31\"", "article_summary": "Reed: \u201c...what can it mean to be on the political left?\nBut Reed is making an argument that goes beyond the current Democratic Party, and there are three points worth exploring further.\nLiberals see a greater role for the federal government, for instance in absorbing the costs of a major expansion of Medicaid.\nConservatives want to turn everything over to the states where it will be easier to starve and replace with private control.\nThe two parties at this point are pushing two very different, ideological visions of the role of the state and the market."}
