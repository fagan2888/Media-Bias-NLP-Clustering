Madison – Wisconsin tailbacks Dare Ogunbowale and Taiwan Deal and safety/wide receiver Tanner McEvoy should get plenty of work when UW hosts Miami (Ohio) at 11 a.m. Saturday.



According to UW officials, tailback Corey Clement (groin) will not play. Clement was limited to eight carries for 16 yards and two catches for 19 yards in the opener against Alabama.



Ogunbowale and Deal combined for 23 yards on nine carries in the opener. Ogunbowale also had six catches for 39 yards.



McEvoy is set to start at safety and wide receiver for UW. He played only on offense in the opener – because he had missed practice time after suffering a hamstring injury.



Safety Michael Caputo is also expected to start, giving UW its top safety tandem.



Tight end Troy Fumagalli, limited in the opener because of an ankle injury, is not expected to play.
