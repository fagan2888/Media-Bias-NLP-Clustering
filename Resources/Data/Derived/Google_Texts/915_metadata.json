(Jacquelyn Martin/Associated Press)\n\nIn her book \u201cUp in Smoke,\u201d the late lamented Martha Derthick wrote that \u201cmuch of the activity of American policymaking consists of attempts not to pass new laws but to invest old ones with new meanings.\u201d She was writing about the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s efforts to regulate cigarettes under President Bill Clinton \u2014 but as I noted in an earlier post, she would find plenty of fodder in the Obama administration\u2019s declarations of unilateralism aiming to leverage \u201cpen and phone\u201d into policy change.\n\nWho gets to decide what a statute means? \u201cCongress\u201d is of course the first answer \u2013 legislators write the laws, after all. But for many reasons both good (e.g., the need to provide wiggle room to deal with unexpected real-world circumstances) and bad (e.g., incompetence in drafting bills) statutory language is frequently inexact, whether by choice or by chance. Thus the rise of administrative discretion, which has taken on more importance over time as the executive branch has grown in size and policy scope.\n\nThat discretion received some interesting buffeting in the Supreme Court this week. Normally, the Court preaches judicial deference to an executive branch department or agency\u2019s interpretation of a vague law, assuming it does so in on reasonable grounds. This template was laid out in the 1984 Chevron case, as explained here in more detail.\n\nIn King v. Burwell, though, Justice Roberts\u2019s majority opinion diverges from the lower courts\u2019 reasoning and explicitly decides not to use the Chevron framework. The tax credits in question (and whether they could be provided to those insured via state, not federal, health care exchanges) were \u201ccentral to this statutory scheme; had Congress wished to assign that question to an agency, it surely would have done so ex\u00adpressly.\u201d Thus in the Affordable Care Act, the court held, the statutory ambiguity in question was not delegated to the IRS in the first place. It was up to the court, not the agency, to figure out \u201cthe correct reading\u201d of the section; it did so in the government\u2019s favor, but while inserting the court firmly in between Congress and the executive branch.\n\nThough he joined the \u201capplesauce\u201d-scented dissent to King, that interposition is apparently fine with Justice Clarence Thomas.\n\nThomas, in a concurring opinion to Michigan v. EPA, said he had \u201cserious questions about the constitutionality about our broader practice of deferring to agency interpretations of federal statutes.\u201d Normally this allows the agency to serve as \u201cthe authoritative interpreter\u201d of ambiguous legal language. Going further still, a statute that is vague enough may allow the agency to \u201cfill a space in the enacted law\u201d that effectively turns interpretation into legislating. Both possibilities, Thomas argues, raise \u201cserious separation-of-powers questions.\u201d From here, a plausible turn would have been to rail against congressional laziness in drafting statute or its delegation of power to the executive branch \u2013 perhaps even to revive the 1935 Schechter Poultry doctrine, which struck down the New Deal\u2019s National Industrial Recovery Act on the grounds that it gave legislative power to the president.\n\nInstead, Thomas argues for enhanced judicial scrutiny. \u201cWe should be alarmed,\u201d Thomas posits, that the \u201cextremely permissive limits on agency power set by our precedents\u201d have emboldened those agencies to think that they get to \u201csay what the law is.\u201d That, as discerning fans of jurisprudence will know, is the courts\u2019 (also self-proclaimed) job.\n\nThe other arguments in the Michigan case, though, return to Chevron. The word \u201creasonable\u201d is one of the few points of overlap in the competing opinions penned by Justices Antonin Scalia and Elena Kagan for the majority and minority, respectively. \u201cChevron directs courts to accept an agency\u2019s reasonable resolution of an ambiguity in a statute that the agency administers,\u201d Scalia says; Kagan says Chevron says \u201cjudges may interfere only if the agency\u2019s way of ordering its regulatory process is unreasonable \u2013 i.e., something Congress would never have allowed.\u201d\n\nHowever, the two sides disagree entirely on what constitutes a \u201creasonable\u201d interpretation of the law in question, the Clean Air Act. The majority (with Scalia rather happier than he has been in recent days) notes that the Environmental Protection Agency is allowed under the law to regulate certain power plants if that regulation is \u201cappropriate and necessary.\u201d However, when the EPA decided to regulate, it did not take the potential costs of such regulation into consideration.\n\nIndeed, it decided not to do so. But while \u201cthere are undoubtedly settings in which the phrase \u2018appropriate and necessary\u2019 does not encompass cost.\u2026 this is not one of them.\u201d Other parts of the law EPA relies upon do talk about cost, and the agency cannot engage in what Scalia calls \u201cinterpretive gerrymanders\u201d that \u201ckeep parts of statutory context it likes while throwing away parts it does not.\u201d In any case, \u201cread naturally in the present context, the phrase\u2026 requires at least some attention to cost. One would not say that it is even rational, never mind \u2018appropriate,\u2019 to impose billions of dollars in economic costs in return for a few dollars in health or environmental benefits.\u201d\n\nFans of cost-benefit analysis on both sides of the aisle might be pleased to see the Court reify such analysis into the very definition of \u201creasonable.\u201d But the dissenters doubt both his dictionary and his math. It was perfectly \u201cappropriate\u201d to begin the regulatory process, they argue, knowing that future development of the rule would involve the cost-benefit analysis the Court demands.\n\nIn fact, under the regulatory review process run by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) on behalf of the president, an agency must \u201cpropose or adopt a regulation only upon a reasoned determination that its benefits justify its costs.\u201d Complaining of judicial \u201cmicromanagement,\u201d the dissenters say that the EPA \u201ctook costs into account again and again and again and\u2026 so on.\u201d In the end \u2013 some dozen years after it began \u2013 the agency calculated benefits of as much as $80 billion annually, against $9.6 billion in costs. Thus \u201cthe central flaw of the majority opinion,\u201d argue Kagan et al, \u201cis that it ignores everything but one thing EPA did.\u201d\n\nPhilip Wallach, on Brookings Institute\u2019s FixGov blog, notes that \u201cit is hard to overstate just how central debates over Chevron\u2019s proper application have been to recent legal developments governing America\u2019s regulatory state.\u201d How much deference will, and should, agencies be given? How much judicial oversight does it take to get to \u201cmicromanagement\u201d? Is that micromanagement a bad thing, anyway? Given the likely expansion of presidents\u2019 administrative agendas, we can expect these questions to return to the Supreme Court\u2019s agenda as well.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Both the Supreme Court and the president want the job of saying what a law means.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Both the Supreme Court and the president want the job of saying what a law means.", "title": "The week in SCOTUS: Who gets to decide what a statute means?", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/07/03/the-week-in-scotus-who-gets-to-decide-what-a-statute-means/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=http://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/files/2015/07/SupremeCourtGayMarriage-0438a.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/07/03/the-week-in-scotus-who-gets-to-decide-what-a-statute-means/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "SCOTUS, Supreme Court, King v.
