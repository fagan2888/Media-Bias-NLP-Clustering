Lou Barletta (R-PA)\n\nIn the past, Rep. Lou Barletta (R-PA) embraced using the must-pass debt ceiling increase to extract \u201cconcessions from the other side\u201d on the Affordable Care Act. But in an interview with ThinkProgress, a Barletta spokesman said Tuesday that the Congressman wants House Republicans to demand something even more unlikely \u2014 enactment of a Balanced Budget Amendment to the U.S. constitution \u2014 as their price for averting a default on the national debt.\n\nTim Murtaugh, communications director for Barletta, noted that Barletta had made the proposal in a meeting of the House Republican Conference Tuesday morning. \u201cHe stood up to make to make the argument that we should do a Balanced Budget Amendment in exchange for the debt ceiling increase. The Congressman does not support or want to give the president a blank check without exacting controls on government spending.\u201d\n\nThough business leaders agree that a debt default would have a \u201ccatastrophic\u201d effect on the economy, a growing number of House Republicans are seeking to use it as a bargaining chip and reject the notion that raising the ceiling is even essential.\n\nIn April 2011, Barletta reportedly conceded, \u201ca Balanced Budget Amendment is a gimmick,\u201d but co-sponsored and voted for one. In lamenting the proposal\u2019s defeat, he said such an amendment \u201cwould have forced the government to scale back its out-of-control spending and draft its budget the same way millions of American families do each and every day.\u201d\n\nOf course, individuals often borrow in the short term to make investments for the long term \u2014 mortgages, lines of credits, and other sorts of loans are facts of life for millions of Americans. Few people can afford to buy their first home outright or pay for their kids to go to college out of pocket.\n\nIndeed, like many other politicians who make this false analogy, Barletta\u2019s own personal financial disclosure filings reveal that his own personal budget is not balanced. Barletta holds four mortgages, totaling more than $1.4 million, and holds three lines-of-credit with debts exceeding $350,000.\n\nSome Republicans in 2011 also suggested holding the full faith and credit of the United States hostage to enactment of a Balanced Budget Amendment to prevent Congress from appropriating more in spending than the government receives in revenue \u2014 even in times of recession or depression. A 2011 study found that such an amendment would have doubled unemployment and put 15 million people out of work. The ultimate compromise agreed to that year included a vote on the amendment \u2014 which even the GOP-controlled House failed to pass.\n\nEnactment of constitutional amendments require a two-thirds vote in both the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate, as well as ratification by the state legislatures of three-quarters of the nation\u2019s states. Even if federal legislators, who have been unable to cobble together an agreement between simple majorities in the House and Senate, could find a super-majority to support such an amendment, the process of state ratification would undoubtedly take months or years \u2014 and the Treasury is expected to hit the current debt limit on October 17. Asked about how lengthy such a process could be part of any deal, Murtaugh suggested that those details would be \u201cpart of the negotiation.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Rep.
