Reverend Marcia Dyson, Founder of the Women’s Global Initiative said the lack of interest in the #BringBackOurGirls movement was because “black women’s lives don’t matter” on Saturday’s “Melissa-Harris Perry” on MSNBC.

When asked why the #BringBackOurGirls movement had lost interest among the international community, Dyson responded, “simply, that black women’s lives don’t matter. And what’s heroic about these’s girls, is not only do they bring that awareness, along with the Congressional black women like [Rep.] Frederica Wilson (D-FL), and Sheila Jackson Lee (D-TX), and [Rep.] Karen Bass (D-CA), but these girls were targeted, like Malala [Yousafzai], because somebody thought they should not be educated. But they were also trafficked, so what Women’s Global Initiative, in joining the World Ebony Network, for raising funds for their schooling for those escaped girls here in the United States, is making sure that they’re crafted into a voice — to say that ‘we matter, not only in Nigeria, but around the world.’ If you met Saa [an escapee of Boko Haram, who was also interviewed on the program], the most amazing thing to her, when I introduced her at Howard University, she was able to tell these students that when she looked back at her experience, and being educated a little bit in America that she felt like the man who said ‘give me liberty, or give me death’ that she’d rather die than to be a bride of a terrorist, and that resonated so well with the audience there, and her in America as well.”
