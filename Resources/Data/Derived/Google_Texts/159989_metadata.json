And Memnook, a Cree bull rider/bareback rider from Good Fish Lake, Alberta, embodies what Weebles stand for, resilience.\n\n\u201cI got started in junior bull riding in my early teens, left school and told my dad I wasn\u2019t going back unless he bought me a rodeo membership,\u201d Memnook said in a news release. \u201cHe purchased me a Lakeland Rodeo Association semi-pro card, and I never looked back.\u201d\n\nWith a day job as a journeyman carpenter, he rodeoed for the Lakeland College team until he was 21, and then started competiting in events across the country. Memnook, who is now 36, said that his rodeo career didn\u2019t kick into gear until he was about 28. But shortly after that, he said that his life took a dramatic turn.\n\n\u201cI was packing for a rodeo in Las Vegas when things hit me,\u201d he said. \u201cMy back was sore, and I felt feverish. I thought I was coming down with a cold. My wife (Candace) pleaded with me not to go, but being the stubborn guy I am I hit the TransCanada 4-lane highway and set the cruise control. Things got worse. I got really dizzy, and disoriented, and objects started getting blurry. When I got to Edmonton, I checked into a hospital and after an 8-hour series of M.R.I.\u2019s and CAT Scans, neurologists diagnosed me with MS.\u201d\n\nHis initial concern after being diagnosed with multiple sclerosis was \u2018will I ever ride again?\u2019\n\nDoctors told him: \u201cIt\u2019s totally up to you. Some people, when they are diagnosed, go down and stay sick, while others fight it.\u201d And Memnook is the fighter kind of a guy. \u201cRight then and there I said no, I\u2019m not going to lay down and take a beating. I\u2019m going to fight back because I couldn\u2019t see myself being pushed out of rodeo for something that wasn\u2019t my fault. If there was a way to fight it and beat it, I made up my mind I\u2019d do that.\u201d\n\nAnd he hasn\u2019t slowed down since. \u201cI\u2019ve been to seven rodeos in the past month with about two scheduled for every weekend. If anything, MS, for me, was a blessing in disguise once I accepted and respected it.\u201d\n\nStop for a moment and re-play that statement: \u201cMS was a blessing in disguise.\u201d\n\n\u201dThe disease turned my life in a different direction. It was a wake-up call, and I started appreciating life more than ever. I went from a grumpy, miserable, son-of-a-gun to where I am now. Ironically, part of the condition is that MS makes my face form a smile. I don\u2019t cuss or swear any more. It\u2019s helped me make a spiritual connection. I\u2019ve always believed in God, but now I try to live a better life. And the renewed spirituality is helping me ride better. My rodeoing is the best it\u2019s ever been because I have somebody else riding with me.\u201d\n\nMemnook has seen how MS can be a crippler and he\u2019s not taking anything for granted. \u201cI don\u2019t have any unrealistic expectations of how it might turn out. I just live every day to the fullest and make each day as good as I can. A big part of this MS thing is in your head, where all you do is think about it, but rodeo helps me heal my mind. When people see me suit up, they\u2019re shocked at my motivation, but I have a passion for rodeo that\u2019s off the charts.\u201d\n\nSo far off the charts that his goal this year is to be at the Indian National Finals Rodeo in Las Vegas November 3-7. \u201cI\u2019m doing everything I can to achieve that goal, hitting association events and INFR tour rodeos in an attempt to qualify,\u201d said the 2011 bareback INFR Tour title winner. \u201cI\u2019ll do everything in my power to be there.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Orville Memnook, Cree, was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis but continues to compete in rodeos.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "rcjohnson", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/05/27/riding-ms-day-cree-bareback-riders-life-took-dramatic-turn-160503", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/bareback_rider_battling_ms_0.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Riding With MS: The Day a Cree, Bareback Rider's Life Took a Dramatic Turn"}, "abstract": "Orville Memnook, Cree, was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis but continues to compete in rodeos.", "dc": {"title": "Riding With MS: The Day a Cree, Bareback Rider's Life Took a Dramatic Turn"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/05/27/riding-ms-day-cree-bareback-riders-life-took-dramatic-turn-160503", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Orville Memnook, Cree, bareback rider, Indian Nationals Final Rodeo, Las Vegas, rodeo, multiple sclerosis", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 1}, "dcterms.date": "2015-05-27T14:15-04:00", "dcterms.title": "Riding With MS: The Day a Cree, Bareback Rider's Life Took a Dramatic Turn"}, "article_summary": "I\u2019m going to fight back because I couldn\u2019t see myself being pushed out of rodeo for something that wasn\u2019t my fault.\nBut shortly after that, he said that his life took a dramatic turn.\nI just live every day to the fullest and make each day as good as I can.\nMemnook, who is now 36, said that his rodeo career didn\u2019t kick into gear until he was about 28.\nAnd Memnook, a Cree bull rider/bareback rider from Good Fish Lake, Alberta, embodies what Weebles stand for, resilience."}
