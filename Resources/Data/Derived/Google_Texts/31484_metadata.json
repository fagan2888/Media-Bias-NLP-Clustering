Cruz is the only candidate that fits those qualifications.\u201d\n\nAnd Club for Growth Action, a political arm of the conservative Club for Growth, began airing ads in Indiana on Friday as well. That group said it plans to spend about $1.5 million on ad buys throughout the state.\n\n\u201cIndiana is facing a unique moment in history: the opportunity to stop Donald Trump,\u201d said Club for Growth Action President David McIntosh, a former Indiana congressman.\n\n\u201cAfter success with our ads in Wisconsin, Iowa, Oklahoma, and Utah, CFG Action is about to blanket the Hoosier State with a simple message: To stop Trump, vote Cruz,\u201d McIntosh said in a statement. \u201cThere is now no state more important than Indiana for electing Cruz and keeping Trump from reaching 1,237.\u201d\n\nTrusted Leadership is a merger of several other pro-Cruz PACs, all that in some way share the name Keep the Promise.\n\nThe PAC has not only attacked Republican frontrunner Donald Trump but also Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who has remained in the GOP race even though he has no chance of winning a majority of delegates. Kasich is hoping for a brokered convention in which no candidate wins on the first ballot, opening up the contest to other options.\n\nBut Conway said in a statement that Kasich \u201ccannot beat Hillary Clinton because he is too much like her on core issues\u2014like Obamacare.\u201d\n\n\u201cVoters deserve to know this,\u201d she said. \u201cThe way Kasich embraced and expanded Obamacare has cost Ohioans $7 billion.\u201d\n\nUnder Kasich, Ohio used the Affordable Care Act to expand it Medicaid program, something the Republican governor has said made real improvements in people\u2019s lives.\n\nIn other states, including Wisconsin, Trusted Leadership has run ads attacking Kasich as a \u201cliberal governor.\u201d\n\nAccording to OpenSecrets.org, which tracks political spending, Trusted Leadership has spent nearly $2.5 million on the presidential race so far this year. Club for Growth Action has spent more than $9 million.\n\nA new public poll out Friday from WTHR/Howey Politics Indiana shows potentially tight Republican and Democratic contests in Indiana, with Trump and Clinton holding slight leads in their respective races.\n\nSo far, the candidates and PACs have spent more than $856,000 on TV ads in the Indianapolis media market, according to an IBJ analysis of Federal Communications Commission filings. That includes about $73,000 in ads purchased by Trusted Leadership and nearly $250,000 purchased by Club for Growth Action, although that only covers Central Indiana.
