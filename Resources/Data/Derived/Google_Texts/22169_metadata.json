Sometimes it was used against you.\n\nA kind of cultural bean counting was common. At one newspaper we were discouraged from posting any kind of bumper stickers on our cars -- we're not talking about political ones -- that might hint at bias.\n\nIf you were found to have any traditional religious sympathies, watch out. I\u2019ll never forget one hapless reporter friend whose degree from Regent University (founded by Pat Robertson) caused him to be shut out of religion reporting jobs at two major newspapers. He was more than qualified, but the taint of Christian fervor was too much for the editors.\n\nBut these days, some outlets want their reporters to have a personal brand and a point of view. Still, I was surprised to see the following Religion News Service story on the dearth of Muslim reporters:\n\n(RNS) Rummana Hussain was one of those children whose Muslim parents envisioned her in a white coat with a stethoscope around her neck.\n\nInstead, she became a metro editor and reporter at the Chicago Sun-Times, where she covers criminal courts and remains the only Muslim member of the editorial staff. She knows \u201ca couple\u201d more Muslims at the Chicago Tribune, the state\u2019s largest paper.\n\n\u201cBlame it on the parents,\u201d jokes one prominent American Muslim when asked to explain the dearth of Muslims in the U.S. media. Many Muslim-Americans are immigrants who see medical school \u2014 maybe law school, but not journalism school \u2014 as the key to their children\u2019s success, said Ibrahim Hooper, a former television news producer who is now the national spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations.\n\nWell-represented in medicine, Muslims account for a sliver of the mainstream American media. Many Muslim reporters take heart in what they see, at least anecdotally, as a recent uptick in the number of Muslim colleagues: With Islamophobia on the rise and Islam-related stories \u2014 particularly on Islamic extremism \u2014 dominating the headlines, the need for more Muslim journalists seems all the more pressing to them.\n\nNews organizations should strive for diversity in their staffs, including religious diversity, said Richard Prince, a former Washington Post journalist who now writes a column on diversity for the Robert C. Maynard Institute for Journalism Education in Oakland, Calif. \u201cWhen we want to cover communities accurately it helps to have people from those communities in our newsrooms, and in leadership positions as well,\u201d Prince said.\n\nWell, that\u2019s interesting. When Mitt Romney was running for president, I didn\u2019t see a call for Mormon journalists. When evangelical Protestants first became prominent in swinging presidential elections 15 years ago, I didn\u2019t see newsrooms trolling for born-again journalists.\n\nSo why Muslims now? The Prince quote was interesting, but where was he when newspapers have sent left-leaning reporters to cover important-to-religious-people issues like abortion, same-sex marriage and euthanasia? One of worst examples of this was New York Times reporter Linda Greenhouse who marched in a pro-abortion event even though she was covering the U.S. Supreme Court -\u2013 and its various abortion-related rulings \u2013- at the time.\n\nWhich goes to say that the media hasn't exactly lined up over the years to provide like-minded reporters -- or even a diverse flock of professionals -- to cover religious folk. The RNS article assumes that Muslim journalists would be attuned to the finer points of Islamic law and practice.\n\nThat's an interesting point. However, I\u2019ve seen plenty of Roman Catholic and mainline Protestant journalists who haven\u2019t a clue about their own traditions. It also assumes that a Muslim journalist might change the narrative when the subject matter is Islam. But how would a Muslim cover something like the Nov. 13 massacre in Paris differently? The article doesn\u2019t say.\n\nThe only faith about which lots has been written in terms of media influence are Jews. When people ask whether there are more Jewish journalists (defined in terms of culture, as opposed to religious practice) per capita in newsrooms than other religions, the arguments are often rather nasty.\n\nStill, it\u2019s always been a mantra of news organizations that you don\u2019t have to be a member of a religious community to cover that community well. Remember the infamous 1994 Washington Post religion writer job posting that stated, \u201cThe ideal candidate is not necessarily religious nor an expert in religion\u201d?\n\nFortunately, that mentality has changed; the Post\u2019s most recent religion reporter hire used to work for Christianity Today. And remember that Louis Moore, a former religion editor at the Houston Chronicle and a Southern Baptist, always said that people of the same faith should cover their own because only they know where all the bodies are buried.\n\nAlthough I\u2019ve seen media organizations scramble for Hispanic, black, gay, Native American and other minority reporters to cover those communities, that has not happened on the religion beat. Other than Crux\u2019s hire of John L. Allen, Jr., to concentrate on Catholics, I\u2019ve never seen a media organization hire a reporter to mainly cover his or her own faith community. So why does this RNS piece stress that Muslim journalists get hired in the media \u201cto tell their own stories?\u201d\n\nI can just imagine a young Buddhist/Jehovah\u2019s Witness/7th-day Adventist or anyone else belonging to a smaller religious community walking into a newsroom and saying he or she wants to \u201ctell the stories\u201d of their group. Would they get a hearing? Am guessing not.\n\nI think it\u2019s great if newsrooms are truly diverse, when it comes to issues of intellect and culture. But they are not; especially the larger, elite, mainstream outlets. They don\u2019t just lack Muslims, they lack cultural conservatives, people from flyover country, devoutly religious people of all sorts, veterans, blue-collar folks and more. See the conclusions of this famous 2005 self-study of The New York Times (.pdf here).\n\nSo if an editor wants to hire a Muslim journalist, fine. Just remember there are lots of other scribes from other religious traditions who\u2019ve been waiting in line even longer to tell their stories too.\n\nThe photo of Al Jazeera reporter and producer Roxana Saberi is taken from the Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University website.
