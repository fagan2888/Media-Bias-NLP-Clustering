The provision in question involves insurers providing coverage for contraceptive care. The HHS seems to have made this move following a report released by the Kaiser Family Foundation, which showed that many insurers are not offering coverage for contraceptives as required by federal law.\n\nSome insurers are not offering coverage for contraceptives\n\nThe Affordable Care Act requires insurers to provide coverage for contraceptives, but some insurers are not complying with this part of the federal law. Some may have being doing this in order to save money, but others may have simply misunderstood the provision and its stipulations. The HHS will be guiding these companies into providing coverage for contraceptives for the next coverage year. These companies will have to introduce this coverage into all policies and will have 14 months to comply with the guidance or risk having action taken against them by the HHS.\n\nSome businesses are seeking exemption from federal provisions\n\nThe Affordable Care Act does provide exemptions for the vast majority of businesses that do not want to provide coverage for contraceptives. These businesses are not forced to support such coverage, but they are required to offer their employees a range of health insurance policies in many cases. Large businesses are not also required to provide coverage for contraceptives, but only if they have grandfathered policies from before the Affordable Care Act took effect.\n\nModest health insurance disruption has been seen in the market\n\nThe federal government is making a greater effort to enforce new rules on health insurance companies. Doing so has been a difficult process, however, as businesses, both large and small, are making it more complicated for insurers to provide appropriate coverage. Some companies are claiming religious exemptions from the provisions of the Affordable Care Act. This has caused only modest disruption in the health insurance market, however.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "health insurance, health care news, health insurance news, health insurance industry, affordable care act, department of health and human services, health care reform, hhs, us health insurance, finance, insurance, insurance news, auto insurance, homeowners insurance, insurance industry news, insurance technology, workers compensation, long term care insurance, florida insurance news, business insurance, disability insurance, life insurance news, natural disasters, financial news, flood insurance news", "og": {"site_name": "Live Insurance News", "description": "health insurance companies that are in violation of one of the provisions of the Affordable Care Act.
