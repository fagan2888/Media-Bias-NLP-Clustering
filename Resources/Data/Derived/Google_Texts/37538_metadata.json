Bush both parlayed years in the Arkansas and Texas governor\u2019s mansions into two-term presidencies. So did Ronald Reagan. The 2010 gubernatorial wave election that thrust Republicans Scott Walker, Rick Snyder, Rick Scott, John Kasich and Susana Martinez into state houses across the country seemingly produced a promising crop of future presidential candidates. And Republican Mitt Romney proved in 2012 that his experience as governor of Massachusetts was a useful route to a presidential nomination \u2013 if not a guarantee of election.\n\nRelated: Analysts Dubious About Christie\u2019s Presidential Hopes\n\nOverall, 20 of the 43 presidents in U.S. history previously served as governor. And throughout American history, about twice as many governors as senators have been chosen to be standard bearers by the major parties.\n\nWalker, the high-profile governor of Wisconsin who made his reputation battling state employees over bargaining rights, won\u2019t say whether he is considering running for president in 2016. But he insists that the GOP must nominate a governor and not a senator or congressman. Walker told The Daily Caller that lawmakers simply don\u2019t have the sort of experience that governors can boast.\n\nAsked to describe how he views the role of being governor \u2014 compared to being a senator \u2014 Walker responded: \u201cMakes decisions. Gets things done. Held accountable. The buck stops with you.\u201d\n\nYet practically overnight, the political gloss of being a governor has begun to fade. Political boasting of the virtues of state chief executives reaching the White House has given way to shock and head-scratching over two major scandals that may derail the presidential prospects of one leading Republican and possibly send another to prison. In a third case, a Republican senator who is likely to succeed Bobby Jindal as governor of Louisiana has demonstrated that low-life behavior is no disqualification for being a governor.\n\nRelated: Charges by Hoboken Mayor Over Sandy Funds Questioned\n\nNew Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, viewed by many as the Republicans\u2019 2016 presidential frontrunner after scoring an impressive reelection last November, was sworn in on Tuesday amid metastasizing scandals.\n\nFirst came reports that several of his top advisers decided to punish the Democratic mayor of Fort Lee, N.J. who did not support Christie\u2019s reelection, by closing lanes on the George Washington Bridge last September causing major traffic jams in Fort Lee.\n\nThen came charges by the Hoboken\u2019s Democratic mayor, Dawn Zimmer, that the lieutenant governor told her last spring that Hurricane Sandy relief money for her city was contingent on Zimmer\u2019s support for a commercial development in Hoboken favored by Christie.\n\nChristie has denied knowledge of any wrongdoing as the state legislature as federal authorities rev up investigations. But his popularity and credibility are falling like a stone. Instead of projecting integrity, administrative competence and a bipartisan spirit \u2013 traits critical to a politician who aspires to follow a moderate path to higher office \u2013 Christie for now looks like just another New Jersey pol trying to save his political skin.\n\nRelated: McDonnell, Former VA Governor, Charged in Gifts Case\n\nFormer Virginia governor Robert F. McDonnell and his wife, Maureen were charged on Tuesday with illegally accepting at least $165,000 in gifts, luxury vacations and a large loan from a wealthy Richmond area businessman in return for official favors.\n\nVirginia prides itself in having a relatively clean government, so the news of McDonnell\u2019s indictment came as a shock to many \u2013 even though there was ample warning in the press that McDonnell could be charged shortly after he left office this month.\n\nMcDonnell took office with a reputation as a straight arrow, and he was considered for the Republican vice presidential nomination in 2012 and mentioned as a possible presidential candidate in 2016. But now he must set aside any thought about his political future and instead fight to keep himself and his wife out of prison.\n\nThe charges in the 14-count indictment are not pretty: Business executive, Jonnie R. Williams Sr., showered the McDonnell\u2019s with clothes, shoes and accessories from Oscar de la Renta and Louis Vuitton, two sets of golf clubs, two iPhones and a silver Rolex inscribed \u201c71st Governor of Virginia.\u201d Williams even picked up a $15,000 catering tab at McDonnell\u2019s daughter\u2019s wedding, according to the federal charges. In exchange, authorities said McDonnell and his wife worked to lend their prestige and help of the governor\u2019s office to Williams\u2019s failing dietary supplement company called Star Scientific.\n\nMcDonnell insists that while he used bad judgment in accepting the gifts, he did nothing illegal for Williams and that the case against him was an example of overreach by the federal government.\n\nSen. David Vitter of Louisiana announced on Tuesday that he will run for governor in 2015, and many political experts are predicting that he will succeed in replacing Gov. Bobby Jindal, who is term-limited.\n\nIf Vitter indeed succeeds, it will be another blemish on the governor\u2019s mansion in a state with a storied record of scoundrels holding that office. In 2007, Vitter was forced to publicly apologize after his number was discovered in the telephone records of the \u201cD.C. Madam,\u201d the owner of a major escort service and prostitution ring in the Washington area.\n\n\u201cThis was a very serious sin in my past for which I am, of course, completely responsible,\u201d Vitter, who is married and has four children, said in the statement.\n\nVitter was never charged in the matter, and a congressional panel cleared him of wrongdoing. \u201cThrough luck and perseverance he escaped the fate of many other politicians who were expelled from office after a sex scandal,\u201d according to the Washington Post. \u201cIn recent years, Vitter has climbed from the depths of personal and political embarrassment to reestablish his footing as one of his state\u2019s most popular politicians.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Blogs/TFTalk/2014/01/22/Do-Governors-Make-Better-Presidents-Maybe-Not-After-These-Scandals", "type": "article", "site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The conventional political wisdom has been that governors made the strongest president", "title": "Do Governors Make Better Presidents?
