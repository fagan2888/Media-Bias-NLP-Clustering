Christie\u2019s administration is allowed to stub a toe without his knowledge or permission. Okay, so the big man fired Bridget Kelly. You can be sure that she will be well-compensated for taking the hit. It is reassuring that this disgraceful act has caught the attention of federal investigators. Christie\u2019s arrogance, vindictiveness and total lack of decency are deplorable. Carole Canace\n\nBrooklyn: Christie needs to have his people arrested \u2014 or he\u2019ll look even weaker than Obama to the rest of the world. Lisa DeSantis\n\nPearl River, N.Y.: I\u2019m glad to see you lambasted Gov. Christie over the George Washington Bridge thing, just as you did with President Obama over Fast and Furious, Benghazi, the IRS, the NSA, etc. I guess it\u2019s difficult to be fair and balanced. By the way, I\u2019m no fan of Christie. Thomas McNaughton\n\nPower corrupts\n\nLodi, N.J.: It is scary to think of Conehead Christie sitting in the Oval Office with full Presidential powers at his disposal. He and his cronies might make Nixon and his thugs look like choir boys. Paul Morais\n\nWanna bet?\n\nBrooklyn: So now Chris Christie, a Republican, is being raked over the coals by the tabloid the Daily News has become. I know you won\u2019t have the balls to print this letter. My father worked as pressman for over 35 years at the Brooklyn plant on Dean and Pacific Sts. He always said he never wanted to retire. He would puke if he saw what his beloved News has turned into. Hillary Clinton got away with murder in Benghazi, but I\u2019m sure The News will endorse her in 2016 even though it endorsed the community organizer against her last time around. J. Christopher Stevens, Sean Smith, Glen Doherty, Tyrone Woods: Do these names mean anything to you clowns at the editorial desk at the New York Daily Worker \u2014 oops, I mean News? Hillary has their blood on her hands and you\u2019re worried about a traffic tie-up? Cathleen Sheehan-Wilson\n\nStop the horror\n\nBronx: Dear God, please protect all the innocent and helpless children who are being abused and mistreated. Please allow neighbors and families to see the signs and give them the strength to do something about them. Also, please allow guardians to see the sadness they are causing. RIP, little Myls Dobson. Christina Figueroa\n\nGodspeed\n\nBronx: Thank you, Carolyn McCarthy, for all you stand for and tried to do. May God bless you and your family. Albert M. Gabriel\n\nStop and think\n\nPiscataway, N.J.: City Councilman Jumaane Williams and Public Advocate Letita James joined murder victims\u2019 families at City Hall because they want the NYPD to focus on outer-borough homicides. These are two of the biggest complainers about stop and frisk. Perhaps if they allowed the police to do their jobs without crying racism, many of these victims would still be alive. Vincent Piano\n\nObamacaregate\n\nHolmdel, N.J.: Obamacare qualifies applicants based solely on reported income; personal assets are not factored in. What this basically means is that those below 65 and retired, semi-retired \u2014 or those who claim little or no income \u2014 can leave their million-dollar mansions and drive to the nearest government-funded (i.e., middle-class-taxpayer and senior, Medicare recipient-funded) doctor, dentist, pharmacy in their Rolls Royce and receive free care. Why isn\u2019t the Daily News investigating this \u2014 instead of focusing its energies on exposing a bridge scandal? Denise Miller\n\nO brother, where art thou?\n\nStony Point, N.Y.: It\u2019s amazing how you can cover pages of talentless celebrities, yet you did not print one line on the passing of Phil Everly. He, along with his brother Phil, were the icons of rock and roll. Without their harmonies, the Beatles and Simon and Garfunkel would not have had the success that they achieved. So many tried to imitate them but could not come close. Shame on you for not even mentioning the loss of this great American singer. Lois Baruch\n\nEasy does it\n\nManhattan: As nutritionist, I was very pleased to see your coverage of teacher John Cisna\u2019s weight loss and associated health benefits (\u201c\u2018Super Size Me\u2019 idea leads to big weight loss for Iowa man,\u201d NYDailyNews.com, Jan. 4), including lower cholesterol, after eating a McDonald\u2019s diet for 90 days. Cisna\u2019s experiment shows that all types of food can fit into one\u2019s diet when eaten in moderate portions and balanced with exercise. So if you like chocolate, pizza or even Big Macs, it can all fit in moderation. This philosophy of moderation \u2014 not elimination \u2014 is what I have been teaching my clients for years. It has helped most of them achieve lasting weight loss. Jessica Fishman Levinson\n\nKilling is killing\n\nBrooklyn: It is a shame what happened to Menacham Stark. However, some have claimed that coverage of the murder has been anti-Semitic. Meanwhile, Stark\u2019s brother-in-law, Moses Strulowitz is quoted as saying the killing looked like a Mafia job. That, Moses, is anti-Italian. Mary Ellen Becht\n\nA mark against her\n\nWoodhaven: How can our new City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito possibly forget a sum that is probably more than half the amount of her salary? How does anybody forget that much, especially someone so intelligent and accomplished, unless she is so rich this money is just a drop in the bucket to her? Leonard Rothstein\n\nWeed the people\n\nBrooklyn: While I commend Gov. Cuomo for his efforts to legalize medical marijuana in New York, I don\u2019t think he goes far enough. Everyone who needs it should have access to pot, not just those who can get past the hurdle of a committee to decide who gets it or not. We could be raising millions in revenue by taxing it like cigarettes and alcohol, both of which it\u2019s no worse than! Since our legislature has proven itself incapable of making a decision, why not put it on the ballot and let the people decide? Isn\u2019t that what democracy is all about? Tom Ghaney\n\nA plea to Con Ed\n\nBellerose, L.I.: To Con Edison: For 18 years, I had a gas and electric meter outside of my house. Two years ago, it was replaced with just an electric meter outside. The gas meter is now in my basement. But the meter man who comes the 9th of the month is afraid of my dog (who I put in my bedroom when he is supposed to come). So the gas meter in the basement doesn\u2019t get read \u2014 and Con Ed sends me estimated bills instead: $900 for two years of gas. I want the meter put back on the outside of my house but Con Ed says I need a doctor\u2019s letter. I\u2019m 82 years old and I can\u2019t get downstairs to the basement use a walker. I thought Con Ed helps seniors, not hurts them. Jenny Constantino\n\nWhat a worm\n\nRidgewood: Since Dennis Rodman sang \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d to North Korea\u2019s dictator Kim Jong Un last week, I wonder if he would he do the same if Hitler were alive today? Francheisko Perez\n\nTotally spent\n\nDumont, N.J.: Republican Sen. Rand Paul says that he\u2019s for extending unemployment benefits as long as we can find a way to pay for them. Whoa! Wait a minute! What a crazy Tea Party extremist! Let\u2019s extend unemployment benefits forever, without the money to pay for it. While we\u2019re at it, let\u2019s create a $3 trillion health-care system with money we don\u2019t have. Let\u2019s wage wars with money we don\u2019t have. Let\u2019s start spending billions of dollars for new pre-k schooling programs with money that we don\u2019t have. Gotta go now. I\u2019m becoming a liberal. I\u2019m going to go out and buy a Ferrari that I can\u2019t afford. John Scott\n\nTip of the iceberg\n\nBrooklyn: The ever-present tip cup has gotten completely out of control. Waiters and waitresses are entitled to and deserve tips because they are not paid the hourly minimum wage and they serve you throughout your meal. But nowadays, I am expected to tip virtually everywhere: the supermarket cashier, Dunkin Donuts, bagel store. I don\u2019t understand this concept. I am served over a counter and get my stuff to go and someone I have interacted with for at best a few minutes expects me to leave a tip. Why? Jamie C.
