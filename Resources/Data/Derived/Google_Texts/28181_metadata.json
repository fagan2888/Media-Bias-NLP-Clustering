I would have loved the opportunity to elect a principled Speaker who shares Alabama\u2019s conservative values. Unfortunately, that was not a viable option because we lack the votes to elect such a Speaker.\n\nElections have consequences. In 2014, the liberal, establishment wing of the Republican Conference won more elections than did the Republican conservative wing. As a consequence, only three things could come of today\u2019s House Speaker vote: (1) John Boehner is reelected Speaker (either today or at a later time), (2) the House elects a Speaker even more liberal than John Boehner, or (3) there is chaos for days, weeks, or months because the House cannot lawfully conduct any business until a Speaker is elected. That would mean no votes on funding the government, no votes to repeal or replace ObamaCare, no votes to defund President Obama\u2019s illegal amnesty for illegal aliens, and the like.\n\nI don\u2019t support chaos and government shutdowns. I believe it unwise and counterproductive for the GOP Congress\u2019 first act to be a dysfunctional inability to elect a Speaker followed by chaos.\n\nI don\u2019t support risking the election of a new, more liberal House Speaker who is even less likely to adequately fund national defense and NASA, more likely to support ObamaCare and illegal alien amnesty, and less likely to address America\u2019s deficits and debt. That\u2019s not good for Alabama or America.\n\nHence, the best option was voting for House Speaker John Boehner. So I did.\n\nAs an aside, the real vote for House Speaker took place in November, when House Republicans selected John Boehner as our nominee. I personally encouraged our conservative, viable House leaders (Jeb Hensarling [TX], Jim Jordan [OH], Tom Price [GA], etc.) to be Speaker candidates. They, and all other conservative leaders, declined to run. In November, the \u201cconservative forces\u201d were unable find a candidate to rally behind and the opportunity passed, even though the November GOP Conference vote would have been by a secret ballot.\n\nTo use an apt analogy, the GOP \u201cprimary\u201d for House Speaker was in November. That is when serious opposition to John Boehner should have arisen, and when we could have addressed the issue in a more deliberative fashion. Republican John Boehner\u2019s \u201cgeneral election\u201d against the Democrat\u2019s nominee, Nancy Pelosi, was on January 6. Splitting the Republican general election vote made no sense because there was literally no better result that could ensue.\n\nDuring the last two Congresses, I helped lead the fight in the House to stop Obama\u2019s illegal alien amnesty, to repeal or replace ObamaCare, to balance our budget, to reprioritize spending so as to properly fund national security, and to promote and protect free enterprise solutions that create jobs and higher incomes for American families. I will continue that work.\n\nNow that we have a Republican Senate to join us, and the internal fight over House Speaker is behind us, I look forward to uniting our efforts to reverse the damage President Obama\u2019s policies have done to America\u2019s national security, economy, and international prestige. I look forward to fighting these good fights.\n\nPrint\n\nMo Brooks represents Alabama\u2019s 5th Congressional District in the United States House of Representatives", "article_metadata": {"description": "Alabama Congressman Mo Brooks reluctantly voted for John Boehner to be Speaker of the House.", "og": {"site_name": "Yellowhammer News", "description": "Despite serious reservations, today I voted for John Boehner for House Speaker because there was no better option before me.
