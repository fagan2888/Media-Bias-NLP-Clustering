Five weeks had passed since her liver transplant, and she hurt just lying still.\n\nDr. Katie Schlenker softly touched her leg. \u201cAre you still in a lot of pain?\u201d\n\nHenry, a petite mother of five who has been hospitalized since early September, closed her eyes and nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s not like an ache,\u201d she told her doctor. \u201cIt\u2019s pain that just won\u2019t go away.\u201d\n\nSchlenker is a physician unlike most at the University of Washington Medical Center. As a palliative-care doctor, her role is to comfort her patients instead of cure them, to help them cope with their illnesses rather than to treat them.\n\nWhen Henry was in intensive care, Schlenker stood beside her patient\u2019s husband and children as the family prayed for recovery. They talked extensively about what the family wanted to do if Henry took a turn for the worse. After the transplant, Schlenker and her team helped with the pain and made a \u201csuccess chart\u201d to mark Henry\u2019s daily progress.\n\n\u201cAnything I need, they are there,\u201d said Henry, 48.\n\nHospitals around the country are increasingly starting palliative-care programs, designed to relieve seriously ill patients\u2019 pain, stress and symptoms regardless of how long they have to live. While some patients are close to death, others are still receiving treatment to extend their days. And as they do, the palliative-care team, including doctors, social workers, nurses and chaplains, tries to improve their quality of life.\n\nPalliative-care teams help patients with issues not always addressed by medical doctors. They help manage symptoms such as nausea, difficulty sleeping and fatigue, and they coordinate with the doctors providing treatment. They also provide patients and families with emotional and spiritual support.\n\nMore than two-thirds of hospitals with more than 50 beds offer palliative care, up from 25 percent in 2000, according to the Center to Advance Palliative Care at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York.\n\nWashington state is a leader; more than 80 percent of hospitals have such programs.\n\nThe increase in popularity results in part from the growing number of people with chronic illness who may not be ready for hospice. Medicare pays for hospice benefits only if patients have six months or less to live and agree to forgo treatment that prolongs life.\n\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be days or weeks from death to have your symptoms managed and pain taken care of,\u201d said R. Sean Morrison, director of the National Palliative Care Research Center.\n\nBut some doctors resist palliative care because they believe it pushes patients away from medical treatment that could help them fight their illnesses.\n\nEven the idea of patients planning ahead and making decisions about their care has caused controversy. A provision that would have paid doctors for having discussions about living wills with their patients was taken out of the Affordable Care Act after conservatives raised concerns over \u201cdeath panels.\u201d An Oregon congressman is trying to revive that discussion with a similar proposal.\n\nRegardless, experts said palliative-care programs will continue to grow as baby boomers age and as hospitals look for ways to reduce costs and increase value under the nation\u2019s new health-care law. Studies show palliative care reduces health-care spending by avoiding unnecessary treatment and getting patients out of the hospital faster. Researchers have also concluded that the care improves patient satisfaction and lengthens life.\n\nHelping set priorities\n\nOn a sunny afternoon in Seattle, palliative-care physician Melissa Bender stepped into the hospital room of Susanne Becklund, who was diagnosed with leukemia in July. Becklund had been out of the hospital for only a few days since, and had undergone chemotherapy and bone-marrow biopsies. Nothing had worked.\n\n\u201cAll in all, it doesn\u2019t sound promising,\u201d Becklund said.\n\nBecklund, 63, said she knew she might not make it until summer, but that she didn\u2019t have a big agenda. She just wanted to get out of the hospital and breathe in fresh air every day.\n\n\u201cWhat gives you strength during hard times?\u201d Bender asked.\n\nBecklund responded that she just puts \u201cone foot in front of the other.\u201d But since finding out that there was little the doctors could do to treat her cancer, that\u2019s become a lot harder. \u201cI\u2019m trying to get stronger, but for what?\u201d Becklund asked.\n\nBender let silence fill the room before speaking again. She promised to help Becklund live the rest of her life as she wanted. \u201cContinuing everything you are on will keep you in and out of the hospital,\u201d she said of Becklund\u2019s medical treatment. \u201cStopping some of those things will help you get home.\u201d\n\nHonesty and support\n\nLeanne Henry, the liver-transplant patient, wants to return to her home on Whidbey Island within a few weeks but knows that may not be realistic. Since entering the hospital for her liver problems, she has had complication after complication.\n\nIn early September, Henry was so sick that her organs were shutting down, and she was hooked to a ventilator. Doctors repeatedly told her husband that she wasn\u2019t going to make it. Schlenker and social worker Carol Kummet asked what the family wanted to do.\n\n\u201cI told them that she is a mother of five and that she could struggle through this,\u201d said her husband, Dan. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to give up.\u201d\n\nFinally, on Sept. 24, she got a new liver. But the problems didn\u2019t end. She has suffered infections and blood loss and needed several more surgeries. The recent pain sent her to the operating room again. As Henry moved throughout the facility, Schlenker and her team have been familiar faces.\n\nHenry said she feels she can say anything to them. Most of the time, Henry is motivated to get better, but sometimes she just wants to give up. Schlenker told Henry she was there to support her.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve had lots of ups and downs,\u201d Schlenker said. \u201cIt\u2019s OK to have a bad day and to be frustrated and be angry.\u201d\n\nJack Brewer, a 61-year-old welder from Alaska, has had his ups and downs, too. He was airlifted to Seattle after having a massive heart attack in October. Now, Brewer is connected to an artificial heart. \u201cThat is what is keeping him going till he gets a heart transplant,\u201d said his daughter, Amy Snow.\n\nKummet, the social worker, looked at Snow and her brother, Austin Brewer, and smiled. \u201cThat is only one thing that is keeping him going,\u201d she said.\n\nSnow said she had to Google \u201cpalliative care\u201d when the team visited. She soon realized they were there to help the family cope with their father\u2019s illness and to help him be more comfortable. The team makes her dad feel more like a person than a patient, she said.\n\nWhether patients are dying or living with a serious illness, doctors are notoriously bad about having difficult conversations and listening to what patients want, said Stu Farber, who oversees UW\u2019s palliative care.\n\nOn a recent morning, he explained to a group of fourth-year medical students that they would soon be treating very sick patients and needing to talk to them about their prognoses. The talks won\u2019t be easy, as patients express frustration, sadness and grief. \u201cWe went into medicine to help people,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to make people angry or to make people cry.\u201d\n\nFor Leanne and Dan Henry, those conversations and the palliative-care group have helped.\n\n\u201cThey have given us hope,\u201d he said, \u201cwhile everybody else was saying we didn\u2019t have any.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Leanne Henry winced.
