SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. (AP) - A longtime New York jockey was arrested on charges of assaulting his wife in a fight the day after he returned to racing after a serious injury.

Saratoga Springs police say Mike Luzzi was arrested on strangulation, assault and other charges shortly after midnight Thursday.

He was released and raced at Saratoga later Thursday. He rode O K by Me to a ninth-place finish in the fifth race.

Luzzi tells The Daily Gazette of Schenectady (http://bit.ly/1UtNZlh ) his arrest stemmed from a misunderstanding. He says he’s “getting that cleared up.”

State gaming and racing association officials say they’re reviewing the case.

The 45-year-old Luzzi raced for the first time Wednesday since suffering a broken leg, pelvis and other serious injuries when a horse fell onto him Nov. 2.
