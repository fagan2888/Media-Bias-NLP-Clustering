Oil prices took a tumble after some of the world's largest oil exporters failed to reach an agreement in Doha, Qatar, to freeze output to January levels.



In February, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Venezuela had agreed to freeze output if other producers joined them - and Sunday's meeting in Doha was expected to formalize that agreement.



The major sticking point during the meeting was the heightened tension between Saudi Arabia, the defacto OPEC leader, and Iran, which recently returned to the international oil market after sanctions against the country were lifted earlier this year.
