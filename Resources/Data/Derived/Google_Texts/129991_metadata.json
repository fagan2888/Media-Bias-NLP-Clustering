REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\n\n4568530\n\nHow much more Obamacare failure must mount in a titanic heap before Congress decides to get more involved? Congress was given in 2014 a bi-cameral, bigger, and deeper Republican majority \u2014 because of Obamacare:\n\nRepublicans were given the majority \u2014 based on their stated opposition to Obamacare.\n\nRepublican leadership that has since the election done very little to adhere to their vow.\n\nThe people who gave Republicans the majority have noticed.\n\nAnd lest we forget:\n\nHow do we know Conservatives are correct?\n\nThe law\u2019s damage is deep, and omni-directional.\n\nThanks, Mister Vice President. Obamacare: Liberating millions of Americans from all those hours wasted earning money.\n\nNot all of the news is terrible.\n\nOh wait \u2014 all of the news is terrible. Breaking things and then hiring bureaucrats to \u201cfix\u201d them ain\u2019t exactly great.\n\nAnd all of this nightmare mess is just at the federal level. How are the seventeen states that established their own Obamacare exchanges doing?\n\nFailure and Corruption in the Massachusetts Obamacare Exchange It\u2019s no secret that Obamacare\u2019s father is RomneyCare in Massachusetts, and as we look to the problems that plague a government run health care system, The Bay State is a good place to start. Case in point: corruption in the system. Josh Archambault, senior fellow at the Foundation for Government Accountability has dug into the state\u2019s $1 billion Obamacare exchange and found many discrepancies and issues that should concern everyone.\n\nJust another \u201clone wolf,\u201d isolated failure, right? Sadly:\n\nA headline that could easily end with \u201cSo Far.\u201d\n\nMany of the online exchanges are wrestling with surging costs, especially for balky technology and expensive customer call centers \u2014 and tepid enrollment numbers.\n\nThe government\u2019s \u201csolution\u201d to this utterly predictable, and predicted, outcome? Utterly predictable.\n\nTo ease the fiscal distress, officials are considering raising fees on insurers, sharing costs with other states and pressing state lawmakers for cash infusions.\n\nThey demand even more of our money. Shocker.\n\nSome are weighing turning over part or all of their troubled marketplaces to the federal exchange, HealthCare.gov\u2026.\n\nSome states have already done this.\n\nWhat else has happened in the Beaver State?\n\nOops.\n\nYet another unmitigated disaster.\n\nGood idea. Except:\n\nFormer Gov. John Kitzhaber\u2019s and Cylvia Hayes\u2019 Trip to Dump Brings Police Sweeping In The former governor and Hayes showed up at the Knott Landfill southeast of Bend in a pickup and an SUV about 2 p.m. last Friday and spent a few minutes dumping trash, according to Timm Schimke, the director of the Deschutes County Solid Waste Department\u2026. (W)orkers recognized who they were dealing with and apparently decided the dumping might be of interest to law enforcement.\n\nOld school, Hillary Clinton-style transparency.\n\nThis is where the Republican Leadership can do some good politics \u2014 by engaging in some good policy.\n\nYou say you want to undo Obamacare? A great move in that direction is to investigate the state-level Obamacare catastrophes currently unraveling all across the country. They represent billions of federal dollars wasted \u2014 with billions more to be thrown after bad.\n\nAnd they all serve as outstanding visual aides for why federal Obamacare is also irretrievably heinous.\n\nWe must get to the bottom of Oregon and Massachusetts (and the others we already know to be corrupt as well as collapsed) to begin to mitigate the damage inexorably coming from all the others \u2013 up to and including the federal.\n\nThat is, after all, your job.\n\nIt\u2019s good policy \u2014 that is also good politics.\n\nFor what, exactly, are you people waiting?", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Seton Motley", "description": "For what, exactly, are you people waiting?", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "How much more Obamacare failure must mount in a titanic heap before Congress decides to get more involved?\u00a0Congress was given in 2014 a bi-cameral, bigger, and deeper Republican majority -- because o", "title": "Obamacare Is Rapidly Imploding: Will the Republican Congress Finally Do Something About It?", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2015/05/14/obamacare-is-rapidly-imploding-will-the-republican-congress-finally-do-something-about-it/", "image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2015-03-30T133800Z_1_LYNXMPEB2T0KP_RTROPTP_4_USA-OBAMA-HEALTHCARE-e1431615353155.jpg", "height": 344}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "For what, exactly, are you people waiting?", "title": "Obamacare Is Rapidly Imploding: Will the Republican Congress Finally Do Something About It?
