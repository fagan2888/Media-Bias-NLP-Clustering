Ricardo Lara, D-Bell Gardens. That\u2019s forcing them to make the costly decision to go to emergency rooms when their health deteriorates.\n\n\n\n\u201cAllowing them to pay for their insurance makes economic sense and is the right thing to do,\u201d said Lara, as he explained why he introduced SB 4 \u2013 otherwise known as the Health for All bill \u2013 during a May 11 tele-conference call with ethnic media.\n\n\n\nLara said the bill, introduced earlier this year, would give undocumented immigrants the option of buying insurance through Covered California, the marketplace exchange set up under the ACA. That is something the 2010 Affordable Care Act (ACA) denied them. Good as the ACA is, the senator pointed out, by barring undocumented immigrants from benefiting from it the federal government has \u201ccompletely failed.\u201d\n\n\n\nAround 24 ethnic media outlets were on the New America Media-sponsored hour-long call, along with 28 health care advocates and stakeholders.\n\n\n\nHealth Access California\u2019s executive director Anthony Wright, the other panelist on the call, who has been at the forefront of efforts to get the bill before the legislature, pointed out the stark reality of being uninsured: \u201cYou live sicker, die younger and are one emergency away from financial ruin.\u201d\n\n\n\nDoreena Wong, project director for the Los Angeles chapter of the Asian American Center for Advancing Justice, shared her insights on how the Health for All bill will help the state\u2019s approximately 210,000 undocumented Asian Americans.\n\n\n\nSB 4, now \u201con suspense\u201d in the Senate Appropriations Committee (a status every bill that costs $150,000 or more is put on until all the other bills are considered) will allow all California residents to get coverage, regardless of their immigration status. It will allow residents, who meet other eligibility requirements, to enroll in Medi-Cal (known as Medicaid in the rest of the nation), the health insurance program for low-income people.\n\n\n\nThe bill will also allow those who make too much money to qualify for Medi-Cal \u2013 up to about $16,240-a-year for an individual and $33,465 for a family of four \u2013 to buy insurance under Covered California.\n\n\n\nIf SB 4 passes, Lara said, the state would seek a waiver from the federal government to allow its undocumented residents to buy on the exchange.\n\n\n\nIf, however, the federal government denies the waiver, he said, the bill will allow the state to set up a \u201cmirror\u201d marketplace that sells insurance plans identical to those offered through Covered California.\n\n\n\nIn either case, though, unlike legal residents who do receive federal assistance through the exchange, no subsidies will be provided to undocumented immigrants who enroll. This is a departure from Lara\u2019s 2014 Health for All bill, SB 1005.\n\n\n\nThat bill stalled in the Senate Appropriations Committee because of its estimated cost. According to researchers at the University of California at Berkeley and University of California in Los Angeles, expanding Medi-Cal to undocumented California residents would have cost the state between $353 and $369 million in 2015, representing a 2 percent increase in state spending on Medi-Cal. An analysis by the committee pegged the cost of subsidizing insurance purchased on the marketplace at between $20 million and $40 million a year.\n\n\n\nSince no subsidies will be offered through SB 4, the cost will be significantly less. Additionally, if President Obama\u2019s 2014 executive action giving temporary deportation relief for undocumented immigrants is upheld, the cost of SB 4 could drop by about $100 to $300 million a year, Wright pointed out. That\u2019s because many of the 500,000 undocumented immigrants in California \u2013 the bulk of whom are under 45 \u2013 could enter the workforce and get employer-sponsored health insurance.\n\n\n\nWright noted that it would be a relatively \u201csmall financial investment\u201d by the state to cover its undocumented residents. Of the 12 million California residents who are currently on the Medi-Cal rolls, \u201cmany are in the Emergency Medi-Cal program\u201d for undocumented residents. That program allows them to seek hospital care only for pregnancy-related issues or for emergencies.\n\n\n\nAccording to the California Immigrant Policy Center, it would cost only an additional two cents for every dollar the state currently spends on its Emergency Medi-Cal patients to provide them full-scope Medi-Cal.\n\n\n\nWright said the \u201cmomentum\u201d the state has built by passing AB 60, which allows undocumented immigrants to get a driver\u2019s license, and the Trust Act, which passed in 2013 limiting the state\u2019s cooperation with federal immigration authorities when local law enforcement authorities apprehend an undocumented person, will more than likely carry SB 4 to the governor\u2019s desk.\n\n\n\nHe pointed out that as undocumented immigrants are financially contributing to California\u2019s economy \u2013 $130 billion annually to its gross domestic product and $2.2 million in state taxes, according to Lara \u2013 \u201cthey need to be included in our health care system.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are better off if our health care system is stronger and everybody is included in it,\u201d Wright said.\n\n\n\nIf SB 4 gets out of the Senate Appropriations Committee, it will come up for a vote before the full Senate some time between June 1 and 5 after which it moves to the assembly.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Healthforall, Sen.
