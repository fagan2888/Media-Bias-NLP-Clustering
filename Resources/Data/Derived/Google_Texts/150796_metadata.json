The White House previously attributed the poor service to high demand.\n\nOver the weekend, officials told The Journal that, in addition to adding new servers to handle high traffic, information technology workers and contractors needed to redesign key parts of the software underlying the site.\n\nThe site, Healthcare.gov, serves 36 states that, combined, are home to about 30 million people without insurance.\n\n\"We can do better and we are working around the clock to do so,\" Health and Human Services spokeswoman Joanne Peters told the Journal.\n\nThird-party IT experts told The Journal Healthcare.gov was built on a \u201csloppy software foundation\u201d and likely hadn\u2019t undergone enough testing.\n\nThe site did not undergo testing from the General Services Administration\u2019s \u201cFirst Fridays\u201d Web usability testing service, a Health and Human Services Department spokeswoman told Nextgov on Monday. First Fridays is a program to spot glitches in government websites and to make them more user friendly.\n\nMalfunctioning portions of the site include a system to verify the identities of people enrolling in the insurance exchanges, a system to determine whether people are eligible for federal subsidies to buy insurance or are eligible for Medicaid, and a series of security questions, according to people who tried to use the site.\n\nU.S. Chief Technology Officer Todd Park maintained in an interview with USA Today posted on Sunday that the site\u2019s problems were entirely due to heavy traffic.\n\nHe said Healthcare.gov was designed to accommodate 60,000 simultaneous users, which is double the all-time record of 30,000 simultaneous users for Medicare.gov, the site\u2019s nearest corollary in government. Instead the site has drawn as many as 250,000 users since its launch, he said.\n\n\"These bugs were functions of volume,'' Park said. \"Take away the volume and it works.''\n\nPark was formerly CTO of the Health and Human Services Department, which oversees Healthcare.gov, and was involved in the early stages of the online exchanges\u2019 design. Before joining government, he launched Athenahealth, which offers online tools for doctors and patients.\n\nA computer cloud that stores national insurance information that helps power Healthcare.gov tripled in cost since the contract was first issued through the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in 2011.\n\n\u201cThis effort has experienced a significant degree of change after award,\u201d CMS said in a contracting document. \u201cAt the time of the contract award, the scope of cloud computing needs to support the implementation of insurance exchanges was unknown.\u201d\n\n(Image via Gajus/Shutterstock.com)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Joseph Marks", "description": "Healthcare.gov gets coding touch-ups after bugs and glitches in its first week.", "og": {"site_name": "Nextgov", "description": "Healthcare.gov gets coding touch-ups after bugs and glitches in its first week.", "title": "Obamacare Software Failures Confirmed", "url": "http://www.nextgov.com/health/2013/10/obamacare-software-failures-confirmed/71423/", "image": "http://cdn.nextgov.com/media/img/upload/2013/10/07/100713obamacarebugNG-vignette.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Healthcare.gov gets coding touch-ups after bugs and glitches in its first week.", "creator": "@Joseph_Marks_", "image": "http://cdn.nextgov.com/media/img/upload/2013/10/07/100713obamacarebugNG-vignette/open-graph.jpg", "title": "Obamacare Software Failures Confirmed", "site": "@nextgov", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-10-07T16:50:04Z", "sailthru.images.full": "http://cdn.nextgov.com/media/img/upload/2013/10/07/100713obamacarebugNG-vignette.jpg", "sailthru.title": "Obamacare Software Failures Confirmed", "keywords": "healthcare.gov", "fb": {"admins": 578600878}, "sailthru.images.thumb": "http://cdn.nextgov.com/media/img/upload/2013/10/07/100713obamacarebugNG-vignette/sailthru-thumbnail.jpg", "sailthru.tags": "healthcare.gov,channel-nextgov->-health,type-story,length-medium,site-nextgov", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/Nextgov"}, "sailthru.description": "Healthcare.gov gets coding touch-ups after bugs and glitches in its first week."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd392f\"", "article_summary": "The site, Healthcare.gov, serves 36 states that, combined, are home to about 30 million people without insurance.\nThird-party IT experts told The Journal Healthcare.gov was built on a \u201csloppy software foundation\u201d and likely hadn\u2019t undergone enough testing.\nThis story has been updated to include comments from the Health and Human Services Department and from U.S. Chief Technology Officer Todd Park.\n\"We can do better and we are working around the clock to do so,\" Health and Human Services spokeswoman Joanne Peters told the Journal.\nPark was formerly CTO of the Health and Human Services Department, which oversees Healthcare.gov, and was involved in the early stages of the online exchanges\u2019 design."}
