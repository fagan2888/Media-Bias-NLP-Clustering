Many of the state\u2019s most vulnerable patients will be negatively impacted, according to clinicians and advocates.\n\nGroup therapy is a less expensive and clinically effective treatment option for people dealing with substance abuse problems, mental or behavioral health problems. It is also used to help abuse or trauma victims, sex offenders and troubled youths, experts say.\n\nIn addition to the payments being halved in January, the length of therapy sessions that can be billed to Medicaid was shortened in July. That could lead social service agencies and private practices to reduce or eliminate group therapy programs.\n\n\u201cClinically, (cutting group programs) is a terrible idea. Financially, it might be our only option,\u201d said Margaret Joyal, director of outpatient services for Washington County Mental Health Services.\n\nState officials say the decision was necessary to comply with federal regulations and intense pressures on Vermont\u2019s Medicaid budget.\n\nGov. Peter Shumlin has directed all state agencies and departments to level-fund their budgets and look for savings where they can. At the same time, Vermont\u2019s Medicaid program is facing an estimated $40 million budget shortfall.\n\n\u201cThe cut was based on money,\u201d DVHA Commissioner Steven Costantino said in an interview Thursday. The greatest pressure on Medicaid\u2019s budget is increased caseload, he said. Eligibility for the program was expanded as part of the Affordable Care Act, and now roughly one-third of low-income Vermonters receive some form of Medicaid.\n\nMedicaid\u2019s payment rates for group therapy dropped from $61 per patient for a 90-minute session to $41 for a one-hour session in July. Starting in January, the rate will be $20.50 for one-hour sessions. The cut will save the Medicaid program an estimated $1 million next year.\n\nCostantino said the reduced rate puts Vermont more in line with other New England states, citing Connecticut\u2019s $21 rate as an example. He was not aware if group therapy programs in Connecticut have more patients than those in Vermont, and whether that impacts the need for higher payments.\n\nThe state and health care providers face tremendous challenges in ensuring the sustainability of Medicaid, he said.\n\nCostantino said DVHA is working to ensure that changes are based on sound clinical choices.\n\nThe cost of cuts\n\nWashington County Mental Health offers several group therapy programs that meet weekly and typically draw four to 10 participants. There are two trauma treatment groups; a men\u2019s group for newly released inmates; a recovery group for women with co-occurring trauma and substance abuse issues; and general wellness programs focused on cooking, yoga and mindfulness activities that support recovery.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what we\u2019re going to do,\u201d Joyal said. Many group programs are drop-in sessions, and they\u2019re frequently the quickest way to get people who are struggling into therapy. That\u2019s especially true in rural areas where there is a lack of therapists, experts say.\n\nRick Barnett, a private practice psychologist in Stowe and past president of the Vermont Psychological Association, said he has already heard from independent psychologists who won\u2019t offer group therapy once the rates are reduced in January.\n\nBarnett, who has run group therapy sessions for people with drug and alcohol problems, said the reduced rates are absurd given the state\u2019s focus on addiction treatment.\n\nSex offenders are required to enter group therapy upon release from corrections, Barnett said, and he wonders what will happen to those clients once the cuts have gone into effect.\n\n\u201cThat Medicaid would decimate this primary treatment modality seems unconscionable,\u201d he said.\n\nDVHA will monitor the impact of the rate change, and the cut could be revisited if it reduces access to group therapy, he said.\n\nHour-and-a-half sessions that were previously billed to Medicaid in 15 minute blocks must now be billed in one-hour segments. That was required to comply with federal regulations that date back to 2013, according to Aaron French, DVHA deputy commissioner for Health Services and Managed Care.\n\nJoyal, of WCMH, says there\u2019s no clinical basis for the change, and that it actually goes against established best practices, especially for trauma survivors.\n\nFrench said he reviewed the medical literature with DVHA\u2019s chief medical officer.\n\n\u201cIt can still be done in an hour,\u201d French said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing that indicates that a group (session) has to be an hour-and-a-half to be effective.\u201d\n\nIf therapists holding group sessions feel that an hour-and-a-half is important to clients, they should continue to offer that service on their own time. Medicaid, however, will only pay for an hour, he said.\n\nMedicaid payments are set using a \u201cmathematical formula\u201d based on \u201cutilization, physician effort,\u201d and the \u201cdirect and indirect cost\u201d of each service, according to a recent memo from DVHA to Medicaid providers. Payments also take into account \u201cthe amount of legislatively allocated, aggregate dollars available to reimburse for professional services.\u201d\n\nErasing the Medicaid rate increase\n\nKen Libertoff, a 30-year veteran of mental health advocacy, wrote a letter to the Green Mountain Care Board, urging the members of the quasi-judicial body to maintain group therapy rates at the current level.\n\nLibertoff wrote that DVHA will rely on \u201cthe general theme that they are trying to \u2018update\u2019 group psychotherapy codes\u201d to be in compliance, and while he\u2019s not an expert on medical coding, he can say with conviction that Medicaid beneficiaries will lose access to group therapy because of the cut.\n\n\u201cIt will cause practitioners to reduce or abandon this treatment modality, not because it is ineffective or costly but because the state (DVHA) is nearsighted and looking little beyond an end line,\u201d he writes.\n\nJulie Tessler, executive director of Vermont Care Partners, said a 0.2 percent aggregate increase in Medicaid rates for designated agencies and other community health providers approved by the Legislature this year will be all but wiped out by the reduction to group therapy rates. Vermont Care Partners is a trade group that represents Vermont\u2019s 11 designated agencies, which are social service nonprofits with exclusive state contracts to provide care for a region.\n\nThe 0.2 percent increase amounted to $970,000, while the group therapy rate cut is expected to cost providers a combined $1 million (some providers affected by the cut weren\u2019t receiving the 0.2 percent increase).\n\nThe irony, according to Washington County\u2019s Joyal, is that the Department of Mental Health, which works closely with the designated agencies, spent years encouraging organizations like hers to increase their group therapy offerings \u2014 because of their low cost and excellent results.\n\nFrom her office, a stone\u2019s throw from the emergency department at Central Vermont Medical Center, Joyal said underfunding group therapy will put even more pressure on hospitals and inpatient psychiatric facilities.\n\nMany patients already spent protracted stays in hospital emergency departments waiting for inpatient placements. The nearby Vermont Psychiatric Care Hospital is not running at capacity.\n\nWithout the programs to keep people from going into crisis, Joyal said, the hospital and inpatient mental health system is likely to see even greater demand.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Clinicians call cuts in Medicaid group therapy rate shortsighted", "og": {"site_name": "VTDigger", "description": "Clinicians call cuts in Medicaid group therapy rate shortsighted", "title": "Clinicians call cuts in Medicaid group therapy rate shortsighted | VTDigger", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Therapists.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-08-28T12:58:22+00:00", "url": "http://vtdigger.org/2015/08/27/clinicians-call-cuts-in-medicaid-group-therapy-rate-shortsighted/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Clinicians call cuts in Medicaid group therapy rate shortsighted", "creator": "@true_morgan", "image": "http://i1.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Therapists.jpg?fit=1024%2C768", "title": "Clinicians call cuts in Medicaid group therapy rate shortsighted | VTDigger", "site": "@vtdigger", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/vtdigger", "section": "Health Care", "tag": "Medicaid", "published_time": "2015-08-27T20:02:02+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-28T12:58:22+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "medicaid, group therapy, vermont, vermont news, vermont events, vermont press releases"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd14ca\"", "article_summary": "That could lead social service agencies and private practices to reduce or eliminate group therapy programs.\nThe Department of Vermont Health Access will cut in half the amount that Medicaid pays for group therapy sessions starting next year.\nThe cost of cutsWashington County Mental Health offers several group therapy programs that meet weekly and typically draw four to 10 participants.\nMedicaid\u2019s payment rates for group therapy dropped from $61 per patient for a 90-minute session to $41 for a one-hour session in July.\nDVHA will monitor the impact of the rate change, and the cut could be revisited if it reduces access to group therapy, he said."}
