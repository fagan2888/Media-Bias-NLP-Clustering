Well, I think I\u2019ve got it. In a nutshell, it\u2019s the carnival season, and what\u2019s one of the great things about carnivals? Cotton candy!\n\nEverybody loves Trump, the cotton candy candidate. The look, feel and smell of the campaign are the things that have some folks so excited. Forget that it\u2019s not filling. It looks good and, boy, is it tasty. That it is all sugar and hot air is precisely what people like.\n\nFor the racists, Trump blaming Mexicans for America\u2019s demise and attacking the \u201cBlack Lives Matters Movement\u201d with calls for law and order is a convenient and self-affirming truth. For those mad at the Washington political class, his bombast that \u201cthey\u2019re all stupid\u201d is simply him giving them a piece of our minds.\n\nIf you believe money is corrupting the political process, spending his own money to run his own vanity campaign is the elixir we savor. For those tired of a press corps that seems preoccupied with wanting to be the story rather than accurately reporting it, he is the walking, talking embodiment of, \u201cI\u2019m mad as hell and I\u2019m not going to take it anymore.\u201d\n\nIn an age that has become increasingly cynical, in which America\u2019s capacity to lead is in doubt, his promise that \u201cwith me you\u2019ll win so much that you\u2019ll get bored with winning\u201d sounds delicious and too good to pass up.\n\nHow sweet it is. You want to know why Trump is idolized and being sanitized? It\u2019s cotton candy. Now, the obvious problem with that is despite the fact it taste good and looks good, there is nothing there. After the sugar high wears off, the reality hits home: \u201cMan cannot live by cotton candy alone.\u201d\n\nShould we get mad at Trump? No. He\u2019s only selling what so many seem to want to buy. The trouble with Trump is really about the problem with us.\n\nIn the 1995 movie \u201cThe American President,\u201d Michael Douglas\u2019 character, in response to repeated vitriolic attacks by a prospective candidate, says, \u201cAmerica isn\u2019t easy.\u201d How true. Our politics and economy are, by definition, about competition, which means we have winners and losers. That notwithstanding, we are not involved in a zero sum game. The genius of the American way is that there are multiple pathways to opportunity. When we intentionally try to expand those pathways, it gets better for everyone.\n\nAt every juncture in which America has dealt with grievances of injustice, new vistas of opportunity have opened for every marginalized group. Those benefits run the gamut from greater rights to expanded economic opportunities. The civil rights movement not only ended restrictions to equal rights and voting rights, it also expanded rights for white women, Hispanics, gays, you name it. When banks were pressed on the issue of redlining black communities, the ultimate benefit was a surge in home ownership for all working class Americans. The election of an African-American president has given an air of inevitability to the election of the first woman to the position.\n\nAmerica is not irreparably broken, at least not yet. But it is in need of repair. Those politicians frustrated with Trump\u2019s rise to prominence need to offer something more promising, and I don\u2019t mean red cotton candy instead of pink. Reporters who lament Trump\u2019s lack of substance need to stop covering our politics and political campaigns like car crash TV in the name of greater ratings.\n\nFor those frustrated by the fractures in our common life, more Americans need to embrace that it\u2019s our diversity that makes our country exceptional and reject any political pabulum that pits us against each other rather than remind us we need each other\n\nWe have had enough cotton candy for now. It\u2019s time for some vegetables, as mom used to say. We need something that will make us healthy and whole, \u201cone nation under God, indivisible, with justice and liberty for all.\u201d\n\nCharles R.
