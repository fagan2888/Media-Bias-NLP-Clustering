Jose Perez never thought he would be recognized for handing over a boxing title belt to a fellow athlete. But, there he stood last week, accepting a special plaque from the Grand Prairie City Council as the audience gave him a standing ovation, reports KXAS-TV (NBC5).

The 16-year-old is a member of the Grand Prairie Police Department’s youth boxing team. The program started just more than three years ago to develop positive relationships between police officers and kids in the community.

“It’s not about fighting,” Police Chief Steve Dye told KXAS-TV (NBC5). “It’s about teaching leadership skills and teaching accountability.”

At a recent tournament in Dallas, Perez watched as 9-year-old Xavier Rodriguez came up short in a match.

“I felt like he listened [to the coaches] and did what he was supposed to do,” Perez said. “He fought his heart out.”

Perez went on to win the tournament and thought he could help improve the 9-year-old’s day. So, immediately after being presented with the title belt, Perez gave it to Xavier.

“That action by Jose exemplified everything our program is about,” Dye said.
