I've spoken to my doctors and my family and that's how it's come about listening to them. It's hard as you can imagine,\" she says.\n\n\"I think it is worth being able to make these choices,\" she says.\n\n\"I want my family around me and today I've been out doing the groceries,\" she says.\n\nAllison says it is vital more people in her situation get the chance to consider their options and make choices about their care.\n\nMelbourne anaesthetist Professor Paul Myles gave the example of a man in his 70s who was rushed to hospital for open heart surgery, even though his kidneys had stopped working, was in respiratory distress, had poor mobility and memory and required full time care.\n\nThe surgery took nine hours, 20 units of blood and caused three other heart surgeries to be cancelled.\n\nThe patient died in ICU 13 days later.\n\n\"I could not see how he would ever have an acceptable quality of life,\" Professor Myles said.\n\nBrisbane's Princess Alexandra Hospital Professor Ian Scott wrote in the Medical Journal of Australia that 50 per cent of all deaths in Australia are clinically expected because of advanced disease.\n\n\"Almost a quarter of intensive care beds are occupied by patients receiving potentially inappropriate care,\" he says.\n\n\"Regrettably considerable suffering as well as dissatisfaction with and overuse of health care result,\" he says.\n\nThe white paper on End of Life Care found aged care homes often performed unnecessary, unwanted and unsuccessful resuscitation attempts with poor survival rates.\n\nThe report blames a medical culture that sees stopping treatment as a \"failure\" for the problem.\n\nAnd it says too often even when patients have signed and advanced care directive refusing care it is ignored or not made available to hospital staff.\n\nDoctors, nurses, specialists and other health system workers should offer all patients, not just those with a chronic illness patients, the chance to sign advanced care directives while they are healthy, the report says.\n\nAnd it says there needs to be a better system for storing these living wills.\n\nAs the population ages more than 250,000 patients a year are expected to die from chronic disease in 2036.", "article_metadata":
