Jackson, remembered for his appalling treatment of Native Americans, will be bumped to the back of the $20 bill.\n\nAlexander Hamilton will remain on the $10 bill, contrary to the Treasury\u2019s original plan to replace him.\n\nRelated: 10 Women Who Could Be on the New $10 Bill\n\nThe Treasury Department had faced criticism from women\u2019s groups, which have been advocating for more females to appear on currency, and fans of the founding father. This solution should address most of their concerns \u2014 though the Treasury\u2019s plan to redesign the $10 bill first mean Tubman won\u2019t start appearing on bills in 2020.\n\nIn addition, women and civil rights leaders will also be added to the back of $5 and $10 bills, giving those notes makeovers as well.\n\nWith the 10-month debate seemingly at a close, here\u2019s everything you need to know about the new bill and what led to its creation.\n\nWho is Harriet Tubman?\n\nBorn into slavery, Tubman escaped to freedom in the north in 1849 and subsequently became a leading abolitionist before the American Civil War. She helped lead hundreds of slaves \u2014 both family members and non-relatives \u2014 to freedom, leading at least 19 rescue expeditions. She is arguably the most famous \u201cconductor\u201d of the Underground Railroad, which was a secret network of safe houses organized to help hide slaves escaping to freedom.\n\nOnce the Civil War broke out, Tubman served as a nurse, scout and spy for the Union government. She was the first female to lead an armed expedition, the guiding more than 700 slaves to freedom in South Carolina after the Raid at Combahee Ferry.\n\nWhy wasn\u2019t Alexander Hamilton replaced?\n\nWell, the popularity of the Pulitzer Prize-winning Broadway rap musical \u201cHamilton\u201d sure didn\u2019t hurt. Former Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and others also objected to Hamilton\u2019s removal from the $10 bill because of his critical role in creating the U.S. financial system. Hamilton also helped the country repay the massive debt that it accrued during the Revolutionary War. The outcry over the Treasury\u2019s original plans, and the many suggestions that Jackson was a much better candidate to be replaced, proved convincing.\n\nWho chose Tubman?\n\nThe Secretary of the Treasury was responsible for the final decision, but Lew received an earful from the public during the decision-making process. From Lin-Manuel Miranda, the creator of Hamilton, to soccer star Abby Wambach, it seemed like everyone had an opinion. Social media blew up with people posting their opinions and people used the hashtag #TheNew10 to voice their ideas.\n\nThroughout the process, various Treasury officials also conducted roundtables, town halls and other meetings across the country to collect feedback from the public.\n\nRelated: Bernanke\u2019s Right: Don\u2019t Bump Alexander Hamilton from the $10 Bill\n\nWhat ladies got snubbed?\n\nAccording to a memo obtained by The Wall Street Journal, Lew originally contemplated putting women\u2019s voting rights activist Susan B. Anthony on the $10 bill. He then changed his mind and last summer asked for public feedback on the decision.\n\nWomen on 20s, a group that had lobbied for a woman on the $20 note, conducted a survey that allowed people to choose from 15 American women. The public\u2019s top picks included Eleanor Roosevelt, Rosa Parks, Anthony, Sojourner Truth, Wilma Mankiller and Tubman. Tubman ended up receiving the most votes.\n\nWhy redo the bill at all?\n\nBills are regularly redone in an effort to prevent counterfeiting. The Advanced Counterfeit Deterrence (ACD) program, which monitors counterfeit issues, recommended to the Treasury Department in 2013 that the $10 note should be redesigned, which kicked off the whole debate.\n\nWhen will the new bill enter circulation?\n\nThe final design for the $20 bill won\u2019t be complete for at least several years, as the process requires incorporating complex security features. The Treasury Department expects the redesigned note to enter circulation in 2020 \u2013 the 100th anniversary of the passage of the 19th Amendment, which granted women the right to vote.\n\nThe redesign of the $10 and $5 bills will also be happening simultaneously, with emphasis put on the $10 because it\u2019s the one most susceptible to counterfeiting.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Concluding a lengthy and controversial debate, abolitionist Harriet Tubman will become", "title": "Harriet Tubman on the New $20: What You Should Know", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/04/20/Harriet-Tubman-New-20-What-You-Should-Know", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/Harriet_Tubman.JPG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/04/20/Harriet-Tubman-New-20-What-You-Should-Know", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/Harriet_Tubman.JPG", "creator": "@milliedent", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Concluding a lengthy and controversial debate, abolitionist Harriet Tubman will become", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Jackson, remembered for his appalling treatment of Native Americans, will be bumped to the back of the $20 bill.\nTreasury Secretary Jack Lew announced on Wednesday that Tubman will replace President Andrew Jackson on the front of the $20 bill.\nThe final design for the $20 bill won\u2019t be complete for at least several years, as the process requires incorporating complex security features.\nConcluding a lengthy and controversial debate, abolitionist Harriet Tubman will become the first female featured on U.S. paper currency in modern times.\nOnce the Civil War broke out, Tubman served as a nurse, scout and spy for the Union government."}
