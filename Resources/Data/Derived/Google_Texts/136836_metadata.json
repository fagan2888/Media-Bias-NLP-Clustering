That means Muslims in the United States are about 5,000 percent more likely to commit terrorist attacks than non-Muslims.\u201d -- Mark Krikorian\n\n2) \u201cConsider, for example, that in 1958 a mere 4 percent of Americans approved of interracial marriage. By 2013, that number had grown to 87 percent. In 2012 these once-taboo unions hit an all-time high.\n\nKu Klux Klan membership has shrunk drastically from millions a century ago to fewer than 5,000 today. The Black Panthers are essentially extinct. While plenty of other hate groups have attempted to fill the void, they have always operated on the margins of society. Black politicians are now common\u2014President Obama\u2019s percentage of the white vote was almost perfectly in line with that received by other recent Democrats, all of whom were white.\n\nGranted, these statistics offer but a snapshot of American society, but the more one looks, the more a trend emerges. America is a lot of things; racist isn\u2019t one of them.\u201d -- Greg Jones\n\n3) \u201cThe harsh reality awaiting these low-income Americans is undeniable: according to 2013 data from a 2014 Merritt Hawkins study, 55% of doctors already refuse new Medicaid patients. According to the HSC Health Tracking Physician Survey, 2008, the percentage of doctors that refuse new Medicaid patients dwarf by about 8 to 10 times the percentage that refuses new private insurance patients.\n\nSuch \u2018insurance\u2019 from Obamacare not only fails to provide access to doctors, but research in the top medical journals such as Cancer, American Journal of Cardiology, Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation and Annals of Surgery, show that Medicaid beneficiaries suffer worse outcomes than similar patients with private insurance ... all at an added cost of another $800 billion by CBO estimates to taxpayers after the decade.\n\nIt is not hyperbole to call Medicaid a disgrace at its annual cost of about $450 billion, and expanding it rather than helping poor people buy private insurance is simply inexplicable.\u201d -- Scott Atlas\n\n4) \u201cIn other words, all of the disruption, spending, taxation, and premium hikes in Obamacare has only reduced the percentage of U.S. residents without health insurance by 2.7 percentage points, from 13.9% to 11.1%: a remarkably small reduction, and far lower than what the law was supposed to achieve.\u201d -- Avik Roy\n\n5) \u201cBernie Sanders thinks you can pay for an 18 trillion dollar expansion of the welfare state \u2014 to make it align with a Denmark that doesn\u2019t actually exist \u2014 simply by taxing \u2018the billionaire class.\u2019 There are 536 billionaires in America. Even if you confiscated everything they had \u2014 which, by the way, would surely destroy the American economy by triggering the greatest round of capital flight in human history and amount to government seizure of countless businesses \u2014 it wouldn\u2019t come close to covering the tab of Sanders\u2019s proposals.\u201d -- Jonah Goldberg\n\n6) \u201cIn 2010, 38,329 people died from drug overdoses, twice the number a decade earlier. More people died of drug overdoses than from automobile accidents (30,196), murders (13,000) or gun accidents (700).\u201d -- Ann Coulter\n\n7) \u201cBetween 1979 and 2010, for instance, the average after-tax income for the poorest quintile of American households rose from $14,800 to $19,200; for the second-poorest quintile, it rose from $29,900 to $39,100. Meanwhile, per-person antipoverty spending at the state and federal level increased sixfold between 1968 and 2008 \u2014 and that\u2019s excluding Medicare, unemployment benefits and Social Security.\u201d -- Ross Douthat\n\n8) \u201cJust last month, the Senate Judiciary Committee received a report that in just four years, 121 illegal aliens who had been released by ICE went on to murder Americans.\u201d -- Mark Krikorian\n\n9) \u201cOfficially known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, the food-stamp program has become the country\u2019s fastest-growing means-tested social-welfare program. Only Medicaid is more expensive. Between 2000 and 2013, SNAP caseloads grew to 47.6 million from 17.2 million, and spending grew to $80 billion from $20.6 billion, according to the Agriculture Department. SNAP participation fell slightly last year, to 46.5 million individuals, as the economy improved, but that still leaves a population the size of Spain\u2019s living in the U.S. on food stamps.\u201d -- Jason Riley\n\n10) \u201cPace Mr. Obama, the state-prison population (which accounts for 87% of the nation\u2019s prisoners) is dominated by violent criminals and serial thieves. In 2013 drug offenders made up less than 16% of the state-prison population; violent felons were 54% and property offenders 19%. Reducing drug-related admissions to 15 large state penitentiaries by half would lower those states\u2019 prison count by only 7%, according to the Urban Institute.\n\nIn federal prisons\u2014which hold only 13% of the nation\u2019s prisoners\u2014drug offenders make up half of the inmate population. But these offenders aren\u2019t casual drug users; overwhelmingly, they are serious traffickers. Fewer than 1% of drug offenders sentenced in federal court in 2014 were convicted of simple drug possession, according to the U.S. Sentencing Commission. Most of those possession convictions were plea-bargained down from trafficking charges.\u201d -- Heather Mac Donald\n\n11) \u201cThe conservative Heritage Foundation estimated unlawful immigrant households paid $39.2 billion in 2010, but received $93.7 billion in government services.\u201d -- Oliver Darcy\n\n12) \u201cOn Wednesday, a Washington Post article announced that \u2018The San Bernardino shooting is the second mass shooting today and the 355th this year.\u2019 Vox, MSNBC\u2019s Rachel Maddow, this newspaper and others reported similar statistics. Grim details from the church in Charleston, a college classroom in Oregon and a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado are still fresh, but you could be forgiven for wondering how you missed more than 300 other such attacks in 2015. At Mother Jones, where I work as an editor, we have compiled an in-depth, open-source database covering more than three decades of public mass shootings. By our measure, there have been four \u2018mass shootings\u2019 this year, including the one in San Bernardino, and at least 73 such attacks since 1982.\u201d -- Mark Follman\n\n13) \u201cAs Pew Research cheerfully reports, previous immigrants were \u2018almost entirely\u2019 European. But since Kennedy's immigration act, a majority of immigrants have been from Latin America. One-quarter are from Asia. Only 12 percent of post-1965-act immigrants have been from Europe -- and they're probably Muslims.\n\nApparently, the \u2018American experiment\u2019 is actually some kind of sociological trial in which we see if people who have no history of Western government can run a constitutional republic.\n\nAs of 1970, there were only 9 million Hispanics in the entire country, according to the Pew Research Center. Today, there are well more than 60 million.\u201d -- Ann Coulter\n\n14) \u201cNo fewer than eight major studies from around the world have found homosexuality is not a genetic condition.\n\nPeter Sprigg of the Family Research Council says that these numerous, rigorous studies of identical twins have now made it impossible to argue that there is a \u2018gay gene.\u2019 If homosexuality were inborn and predetermined, then when one identical twin is homosexual, the other should be, as well.\n\nYet one study from Yale and Columbia Universities found homosexuality common to only 6.7 percent of male identical twins and 5.3 percent of female identical twins.\n\nThe low rate of common homosexuality in identical twins \u2013 around six percent \u2013 is easily explained by nurture, not nature.\n\nResearchers Peter Bearman and Hannah Brueckner concluded that environment was the determining factor. They rejected outright that \u2018genetic influence independent of social context\u2019 as the reason for homosexuality. \u2018(O)ur results support the hypothesis that less gendered socialization in early childhood and preadolescence shapes subsequent same-sex romantic preferences.\u2019\n\n\u2018Less gendered socialization\u2019 means, a boy was without a positive father figure, or a girl was without a positive mother figure.\n\nIn light of the evidence, Sprigg said simply, \u2018No one is born gay.\u2019\u201d -- Mark Hodges\n\n15) \u201cOver the last year, only 1.3 million Americans of working age have entered the workforce, even as the population of this same demographic increased by more than 2.8 million. Just over 1 million members of this group found jobs. That's right -- of the new additions to the working age population, less than four in 10 found jobs.\n\nThe newspapers touted the reduction in the unemployment rate to 5.3 percent as a cause for celebration. Yet for every three Americans added to the working age population (16 and older), only around one new job (1.07) has been created under Obama. At this pace, America will soon officially have a zero unemployment rate. But that will only be because no one will be looking for work.\u201d -- Stephen Moore", "article_metadata": {"description": "Muslims account for only about 1 percent of the U.S. population but account for about half of terrorist attacks since 9/11...\".05/26/2016 18:30:52PM EST.", "author": "John Hawkins", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Muslims account for only about 1 percent of the U.S. population but account for about half of terrorist attacks since 9/11...\"", "title": "15 Stats That Destroy Liberal Narratives", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/johnhawkins/2016/01/02/15-stats-that-destroy-liberal-narratives-n2098999", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2013/101/06e3c992-edfb-4fc0-93a9-02eb10623b08.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Muslims account for only about 1 percent of the U.S. population but account for about half of terrorist attacks since 9/11...\"", "title": "15 Stats That Destroy Liberal Narratives", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/johnhawkins/2016/01/02/15-stats-that-destroy-liberal-narratives-n2098999", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2013/101/06e3c992-edfb-4fc0-93a9-02eb10623b08.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "15 Stats That Destroy Liberal Narratives , John Hawkins, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "Fewer than 1% of drug offenders sentenced in federal court in 2014 were convicted of simple drug possession, according to the U.S.\nIn 2013 drug offenders made up less than 16% of the state-prison population; violent felons were 54% and property offenders 19%.\nBetween 2000 and 2013, SNAP caseloads grew to 47.6 million from 17.2 million, and spending grew to $80 billion from $20.6 billion, according to the Agriculture Department.\nGranted, these statistics offer but a snapshot of American society, but the more one looks, the more a trend emerges.\nReducing drug-related admissions to 15 large state penitentiaries by half would lower those states\u2019 prison count by only 7%, according to the Urban Institute."}
