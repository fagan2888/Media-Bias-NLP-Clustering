It was enacted to increase the quality and affordability of health insurance, lower the uninsured rate by expanding public and private insurance coverage, and reduce the costs of healthcare.\n\nSpeaking to the public at the Good Morning Winter Park program hosted by the Winter Park Chamber of Commerce, Bradley noted that ACA will play a critical role at his hospital.\n\nThe perception many have since the passage of ACA, Bradley said, is that it provides everyone in this country with the coverage needed to ensure they get health care treatment.\n\n\u201cSo you\u2019re in a new age, where everyone has insurance, everyone is covered, right?\u201d Bradley asked. \u201cHere are a few facts about the Affordable Care Act. There are more people insured today than two years ago.\u201d\n\nBut the law may be facing serious challenges when it comes to financing that widespread coverage, he added.\n\n\u201cHere is the dirty little secret about it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need more healthy people in the system to pay for it.\u201d\n\nThe law has also increased pressure on all hospitals to ensure they have the best physicians, he said, making it more competitive to secure them.\n\n\u201cThere is a fight for the heart and soul of our doctors,\u201d he said, adding that the legal challenges to the law have had a chilling effect on some physicians who rely on the ACA to cover their payments.\n\n\u201cWho would you rather come see you at 3 in the morning when you have appendicitis and are in the emergency room \u2013 John Morgan or your own physician,\u201d Bradley said. Morgan is an Orlando trial attorney.\n\nIn fact, Bradley said since the ACA was approved, new patients often ask how to find a physician in this complex system.\n\n\u201cPeople ask, \u2018Who should I go to,\u2019 and I say, \u2018Ask your doctor, do you still enjoy what you\u2019re doing,\u2019 \u201c he said.\n\nIf they say no, the system has gotten too cumbersome, find another physician, he said \u2013 one who still has a passion for providing medical care.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s very, very important to keep our physicians,\u201d Bradley said. \u201cNow there is a tremendous renewed focus on cost and quality \u2013 and this is a big \u2018Duh.\u2019 \u201c\n\nHospitals like Winter Park Memorial, he said, are also focusing more on what he called \u201cPopulation Health\u201d \u2013 or finding ways to ensure the steady good health of the entire community, by promoting healthy living like exercising, nutritious eating, and so on.\n\n\u201cWhat that\u2019s saying is I don\u2019t just have to worry about you coming into my office today, but about the people coming into our office tomorrow,\u201d Bradley said. \u201cI have to worry about the weight of the community. I have to worry about the stress of the community.\u201d\n\nmwfreeman@sun-sentinel.com or 407-420-5290", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Ken Bradley reviews ObamaCare's impact on Winter Park Memorial Hospital", "Description": "When he decided not to run for a third term this year as Winter Park\u2019s mayor, Ken Bradley left the field of politics and elected office to return to his position as the CEO of the city\u2019s largest employer, Winter Park Memorial Hospital.But even in that position, Bradley is dealing with one of the...", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Orlando Sentinel", "author": "Orlando Sentinel", "og": {"site_name": "OrlandoSentinel.com", "description": "When he decided not to run for a third term this year as Winter Park\u2019s mayor, Ken Bradley left the field of politics and elected office to return to his position as the CEO of the city\u2019s largest employer, Winter Park Memorial Hospital.", "title": "Ken Bradley reviews ObamaCare's impact on Winter Park Memorial Hospital", "url": "http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/orange/winter-park/os-ken-bradley-reviews-obamacare-s-impact-on-winter-park-memorial-hospital-20150824-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-55db167a/turbine/os-ken-bradley-reviews-obamacare-s-impact-on-winter-park-memorial-hospital-20150824", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp12.17", "twitter": {"site": "@orlandosentinel", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "robots": "index,follow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=402223551, app-argument=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/deeplinkid/84272561", "fb": {"admins": 100004353067097, "page_id": 5779052556, "app_id": 890804050949750}, "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2015-08-24", "y_key": "fb73650ad672fe45", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "googlebot": "index"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbcf5\"", "article_summary": "Speaking to the public at the Good Morning Winter Park program hosted by the Winter Park Chamber of Commerce, Bradley noted that ACA will play a critical role at his hospital.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s very, very important to keep our physicians,\u201d Bradley said.\nWhen he decided not to run for a third term this year as Winter Park\u2019s mayor, Ken Bradley left the field of politics and elected office to return to his position as the CEO of the city\u2019s largest employer, Winter Park Memorial Hospital.\n\u201cWho would you rather come see you at 3 in the morning when you have appendicitis and are in the emergency room \u2013 John Morgan or your own physician,\u201d Bradley said.\nThe perception many have since the passage of ACA, Bradley said, is that it provides everyone in this country with the coverage needed to ensure they get health care treatment."}
