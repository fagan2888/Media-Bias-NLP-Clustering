One woman\u2019s eggs are mixed in a lab dish with donor sperm, then implanted in the other woman, who carries the pregnancy.\n\nA New York doctor described 18 of these cases Tuesday at a fertility conference in Boston that featured other research on ways to help same-sex couples have children. Dr. Alan Copperman is medical director of Reproductive Medicine Associates, a New York City clinic that does the \u201ctwo-mom\u201d approach.\n\nA New York couple \u2014 Sarah Marshall, 40, a recruiter for law firms, and Maggie Leigh Marshall, 35, a real estate broker \u2014 used it to have their daughter, Graham, now 18 months old. Maggie\u2019s eggs were used to make embryos that were implanted in Sarah, and both women are listed as parents on the birth certificate.\n\nPHOTOS: What are the chances?\n\n\u201cIt allowed us both to participate,\u201d Sarah Marshall said. \u201cI had to mentally and psychologically give up the idea of, is she going to look like me or my family. But from the time I started carrying her up to now, she is definitely mine.\u201d\n\nMaggie Marshall said she had no interest in being pregnant, but \u201cSarah really wanted to have the experience. We also thought it would be a great way to bond with a kid that ultimately would look a lot like me.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t cheap \u2014 the couple spent nearly $100,000 on multiple failed attempts before the last one worked. A single in vitro fertilization attempt can run $15,000 to more than $20,000, depending on how much embryo testing is done and whether some embryos are frozen to allow multiple attempts from one batch.\n\nOne Canadian study suggests that more lesbian couples have been seeking fertility services in Ontario since same-sex marriage was legalized in the province a decade ago. Some doctors think interest also is up in the U.S. For male couples, many clinics offer egg donors and surrogate moms, using one or both men\u2019s sperm.\n\n\u201cThe modern family is created in a way that would be humbled by traditional fertility treatments,\u201d said Copperman. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing more and more couples come in and want to share the parenting experience,\u201d and their medical forms more often say \u201cwife\u201d rather than \u201cdomestic partner.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is something that a lot of lesbian couples choose to do\u201d if they can afford it, said Melissa Brisman, a reproductive law specialist in Montvale, N.J., who has advised many such couples. \u201cSome doctors really have a problem doing this for non-medical reasons\u201d because any medical procedures carry risks of infections or other complications, she added.\n\nMany fertility specialists are willing, though, and see the risks as small.\n\n\u201cWe get same-sex couples from all over the world\u201d because some nations don\u2019t allow surrogacy or egg donation, said Roger Good, chief executive officer of HRC Fertility, which runs nine clinics in Southern California.\n\nIn the U.S., \u201cthere is greater awareness and acceptability\u201d of same-sex relationships, and \u201cless prejudice has allowed them to look at what their options are\u201d for having children, he said.\n\nAbout 65 gay women and 275 gay men or gay couples have been treated at his clinics in the last year, and doctors there report that \u201cthere seems to be an increase over the past couple of years,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the Canadian study, doctors from the CReATe Fertility Center and the University of Toronto checked patient records for the last 17 years and found that the percentage of women in same-sex relationships using the center\u2019s donor sperm rose from 15 percent before gay marriage was legalized in 2003 to 20 percent after the change. Units of donor sperm used by same-sex couples rose from 133 before 2003 to 561 after.\n\nThe Boston conference is a meeting of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine and the International Federation of Fertility Societies, a group of 50 fertility societies from around the world.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Fertility clinics have put a new twist on how to make babies: A \"two-mom\" approach that lets female same-sex couples share the biological role.
