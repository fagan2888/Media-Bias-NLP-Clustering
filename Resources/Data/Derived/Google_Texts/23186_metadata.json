Even more egregious -- the auditors said managers looked the other way and billed the hours under \u201cother time\u201d while also giving each of the workers thousands of dollars worth of performance bonuses during that same time period.\n\nRelated: Employee Misconduct Runs Rampant at the EPA\n\nThe managers \u201cwere completely aware of the volume of \u2018other time\u2019 hours during the relevant time frame and took little action to prevent such waste,\u201d the IG said. The auditors said one manager even dubbed the billing code the \u201cI don\u2019t have work but I\u2019m going to get paid code.\u201d\n\nWhistleblowers told auditors that the paralegals just didn\u2019t have enough work to do, so they spent their time doing other things\u2014some even volunteered for charity organizations while clocked in at the Patent and Trademark Office.\n\nThe report said \u201cnonproductive time\u201d racked up to between 50 and 70 hours in an 80-hour pay period. The paralegals were \u201csitting on their hands\u201d while the backlog of appeals at the Patent and Trademark Office piled up. According to auditors, the number of appeals doubled from 12,500 in 2009 to 25, 300 in 2013. But whistleblowers said the paralegals rely on judges to assign them work and there weren\u2019t enough judges on staff to assign new cases.\n\nNTEU National President Colleen M. Kelley defended the workers, saying they alerted the agency that they weren\u2019t given enough work to do. \u201cThese frontline employees wanted to work. They let managers know that and ultimately some of them went to the Inspector General about the lack of work, which instigated this report,\u201d Kelley said in a statement.\n\nRelated: Meet the Federal Government\u2019s Fraudulent Five\n\nThe report was the subject of a House Judiciary Committee hearing Wednesday, where lawmakers pressed Patent and Trademark Office official Michelle Lee on whether or not the paralegals would be fired.\n\n\u201cIn the private sector, these people wouldn\u2019t be employed long. And to add insult to injury, they\u2019ll get put on administrative leave,\u201d Rep. Tom Marino (R-PA) said during the hearing, GovExec noted. \u201cIt\u2019s a perfect example of how government has grown, and the left hand doesn\u2019t know what the right hand is doing.\u201d\n\nLee said the agency is taking the issue \u201cvery seriously and is evaluating all options.\u201d\n\nThe Patent and Trademark Office is hardly alone in its lack of oversight over some of its employees\u2019 work practices. Just last week, The Washington Times reported that a Federal Communications Commission worker was busted for spending a significant portion of his workweek watching porn because, as he said, he didn\u2019t have enough work to do.\n\nFCC officials have not commented on what, if anything, they will do to deal with the worker. In another case, an Environmental Protection Agency employee admitted to spending two hours a day watching porn. EPA auditors confirmed that when they went to investigate, they caught him watching it on his agency authorized computer.\n\nWith more than 4 million federal workers, there are bound to be a few bad apples. Still managers authorized these fraudulent payments and federal auditors have recommended that agencies tighten up the oversight of their workforce.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The federal government has a serious problem keeping tabs on its employees, from an FC", "title": "Federal Government Pays Workers $5 Million to Not Work", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/08/04/Federal-Gov-Pays-Workers-5-Million-Not-Work", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/08042014_Worker_Asleep_at_Desk.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/08/04/Federal-Gov-Pays-Workers-5-Million-Not-Work", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/08042014_Worker_Asleep_at_Desk.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@Briannaehley"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "The federal government has a serious problem keeping tabs on its employees, from an FC", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd96c1\"", "article_summary": "Still managers authorized these fraudulent payments and federal auditors have recommended that agencies tighten up the oversight of their workforce.\nWith more than 4 million federal workers, there are bound to be a few bad apples.\nThe paralegals were \u201csitting on their hands\u201d while the backlog of appeals at the Patent and Trademark Office piled up.\nNTEU National President Colleen M.
