This comic fan has really grown to hate the word \u201cadapt.\u201d\n\nAdapt allows director Jay Oliva to swap Aquaman (I guess he was unavailable for the shoot) for Captain Marvel/Shazam.\n\nThis might make sense if the toon was crafted as an original story, but swapping Billy Batson\u2019s alter ego into the story that had clearly costarred Aquaman (for good reason) quickly soured my potential appreciation of the effort.\n\nNonetheless, I digress. The story does offer an action-packed origin of the Justice League\u2019s first meeting.\n\nSpecifically, bookended between some witty introductions and a pat on the back for the great work of the Super Seven (watch and giggle) from the U.S. president, viewers do spend an inordinate amount of watching the heroes killing Darkseid\u2019s force of Parademons (creepy cyborg bat beings transformed from earthlings).\n\nActually, I\u2019d report 69 of the 79-minute run time involves someone getting punched, gouged, sliced or crushed.\n\nThe cartoon often stays true to the comic-book series, liberally pulling dialogue and scenes while offering an impactful origin of future Teen Titan\u2019s star Cyborg.\n\nNow, I must have reached Warner Bros. Animation fatigue as I appreciated much of the onscreen design and color and some of the incredible high-speed chase and battle sequences.\n\nWhoops, spoke too soon. Why is Superman\u2019s neck the same width as his head? Not really the Jim Lee-style; more of an homage to artist Rob Liefeld\u2019s exaggerated form choices, for what it\u2019s worth.\n\nWhile on whoops, the voice acting is adequate at best. Kudos to Jason O\u2019Mara as Batman, performing his best Kevin Conroy imitation, but boo to Alan Tudyk for never really capturing the vocal authority of Superman.\n\nAs far as my new favorite animated hero, Green Lantern makes out best here. I enjoyed his wiseacre personality (often trumping Flash) and his glowing green constructs (from a locomotive engine to fighter jet and a massive dragon), emanating on command from his Power Ring.\n\nDespite enjoying the high-definition action, I\u2019ve got more issues with Justice League: War.\n\nA cartoon that allows a citizen of the District to tell Wonder Woman that she\u2019s \u201cdressed like a whore,\u201d does not sit well with me \u2014 nor does the influx of profanity into the dialogue that does nothing to embellish the plot.\n\nThe comic-book series sparkled without any of this stupidity and its simply sophomoric decision making to add these elements.\n\nWhen the last minion has been sucked into a boom tube and back to Apokolips, Justice League War is a rousing donnybrook worth watching but never attains the greatness or emotion of the original comic-book series.\n\nBest Extra: Viewers enjoy a 37-minute documentary on the man responsible for penciling the original sequential art tied to the cartoon. In \u201cCreating Heroes: The Life and Art of Jim Lee,\u201d we get, among interviews with the star, a look at his family and upbringing, pretty slick sketches when he was a 12-year-old budding artist, his success at Marvel Comics on titles such as Alpha Flight, Punisher War Journal and X-Men, his co-creation of the 1980s publishing house Image Comics and his work for DC Comics including the fantastic Batman: Hush storyline.\n\nOf course, we also get a treasure chest\u2019s worth of classic Jim Lee art floating across the screen throughout as DC Comic\u2019s leaders Mike Carlin and Dan Didio praise his career. As a huge fan of Mr. Lee, I could have watched a biography three times as long.\n\nNext is four cartoons from the DC Vault, The best of the quartet is the 2011 episode \u201cThe Malicious Mr. Mind\u201d from Cartoon Network\u2019s series Batman: The Brave and the Bold.\n\nThe 23-minute effort co-stars the too-retro cool heroes Kamandi (the last boy on Earth), Dr. Canus, the Marvel Family (Captain Marvel, Mary Marvel and Captain Marvel Jr.) and a Caped Crusader looking plucked from the animated intro of the 1960s television show.\n\nThey battle the fiendish physicist Doctor Sivana, the Monster Society of Evil and a too-smart worm while Batman deals the effects of an age ray that turns him into a tyke,\n\nThe slathering of witty word play, its nostalgic animation style and tongue-in-cheek moments make the episode a pure joy.\n\nMy least favorite extra is the 23-minute featurette \u201cDeconstructing Justice League: War.\u201d Mr. Lee and Jay Oliva examine a few clips while Mr. Oliva rationalizes his changes to story in front of Mr. Lee. I mean, really? Mr. Lee agrees with the swap of Aquaman for Shazam to delver a more youthful tone, but I still don\u2019t. Overall, it\u2019s a pretty lame replacement for a full commentary track.\n\nReal all about it: For the love of the King of the Seven Seas, please go and read the original source material. Grab an iPad now, get the DC Comics app and absorb the trade paperback Justice League: Origin ($12.99).\n\nMr. Lee\u2019s art is often spectacular, Darkseid\u2019s minions are really creepy and his Batman interpretation is one of the best in the character\u2019s history imbuing the brilliance of Neil Adams and Frank Miller.\n\nIt continues to perplex me that Warner Bros. Animation can\u2019t figure out how to deliver much more compelling animation style based on legendary comic-book creator works.
