It's really been a big blessing to live here,\" said resident Claire Theriot.\n\nTheriot moved into the brand new West Park Apartment complex nearly a month ago.\n\n\"As a single mother, college student and on a teacher paycheck, I don't have much money to live in a beautiful home such as this,\" Theriot said.\n\nThat's why the George Kaiser Family Foundation and other community partners saw the need to add affordable living options for people in the neighborhood.\n\nThere are 128 new apartment units. Half have subsidized rent for lower incomes.\n\nInside there are brand new appliances, full-size washers and dryers, oversized bathrooms and large walk in closets.\n\n\"They're beautiful. They're so amazing. I have an island in my kitchen. I never thought I would ever have one of those,\" Theriot said.\n\n8/7/2012 Related Story: Kendall Whittier Park Project Part Of Whole Neighborhood Revitalization\n\nThe kids in the area will probably think the best part about the revitalization project is the new playground across the street.
