Lawmakers and technologists have protested the move, arguing it will weaken encryption and expose users to hackers.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nPrime Minister David Cameron last July pushed through the Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act 2014 (DRIP). Cameron accelerated the normal legislative timeline following a European Court of Justice ruling that abolished data retention requirements for European companies.\n\nCameron argued his bill simply allowed British intelligence agencies to maintain existing authorities. But several members of Parliament were irked by the prime minister\u2019s use of emergency powers to promote his surveillance agenda.\n\n\u201cThe government\u2019s decision to use emergency powers to enable it to spy on citizens shows the rights of the individual need to be strengthened to ensure the state can\u2019t act with impunity,\u201d Tom Watson, a member of the Labor Party, said in a statement.\n\nWatson brought the case with David Davis, a member of the Conservative Party.

They also think it runs afoul of the right to the protection of personal data detailed in the European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights.\n\nThe human rights advocate Liberty will argue on behalf of the lawmakers.\n\n\u201cThe executive dominance of Parliament in rushing through this legislation \u2014 using a wholly fabricated \u2018emergency\u2019 \u2014 made a mockery of parliamentary sovereignty and the rule of law, and showed a staggering disregard for the entire population\u2019s right to privacy,\u201d said Emma Norton, legal officer for Liberty, in a statement.\n\nCameron has urged President Obama to help him pressure companies to provide governments with access to user data and social media messages.\n\nAlthough Obama supports some type of guaranteed access \u2014 often called a \u201cback door\u201d \u2014 the American leader has not moved as swiftly as his British counterpart and has yet to offer a similar legislative proposal.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The outcome could have ramifications on a similar debate in the U.S.", "description": "The outcome could have ramifications on a similar debate in the U.S.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Cory Bennett", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The outcome could have ramifications on a similar debate in the U.S.", "title": "UK government in court to defend forced decryption law", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/244031-uk-government-in-court-to-defend-forced-decryption-law", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/biz_cybersecuritystory.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T03:39-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/244031-uk-government-in-court-to-defend-forced-decryption-law", "dcterms.date": "2015-06-04T12:09-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Cory Bennett", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-04T12:09:59-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/244031-uk-government-in-court-to-defend-forced-decryption-law", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The outcome could have ramifications on a similar debate in the U.S.", "card": "summary", "title": "UK government in court to defend forced decryption law"}, "dcterms.title": "UK government in court to defend forced decryption law"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe138f\"", "article_summary": "Two members of British Parliament on Thursday and Friday will challenge in court a U.K. surveillance law that requires Internet companies like Facebook and Google to decrypt user data at the government\u2019s request.\nBut several members of Parliament were irked by the prime minister\u2019s use of emergency powers to promote his surveillance agenda.\nCameron accelerated the normal legislative timeline following a European Court of Justice ruling that abolished data retention requirements for European companies.\nCameron has urged President Obama to help him pressure companies to provide governments with access to user data and social media messages.\nADVERTISEMENTPrime Minister David Cameron last July pushed through the Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act 2014 (DRIP)."}
