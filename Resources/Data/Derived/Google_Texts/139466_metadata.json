That means employees in metro Denver are expected to bear the brunt of job cuts when the companies shed duplicate corporate positions.\n\nLong-time TW Telecom CEO Larissa Herda will not join Level 3 after the deal closes, scheduled for the fourth quarter, pending regulatory approval.\n\n\u201cWe know our primary competitors are very large companies, whether they\u2019re incumbent telcos or cable companies,\u201d Level 3 CEO Jeff Storey said Monday during a conference call with analysts. \u201cWe believe that this combination gives us the scale to effectively compete, although we\u2019re still much smaller, which gives us the ability to maintain the nimbleness that both companies are known for and will help us win in the marketplace.\u201d\n\nLevel 3 operates globally, while TW Telecom serves customers in North America. They carry Internet data and offer related services for business clients.\n\nLevel 3 built its reputation as a network operator that transmits data over long distances. TW Telecom has fiber-optic connections into thousands of office buildings in major metro areas that Level 3 doesn\u2019t currently reach.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s going to enable Level 3 to be a broader competitor,\u201d Cowen & Co. analyst Colby Synesael said. \u201cIf you think about the competitive environment for communications three or five years from now, scale and having a national presence are going to matter more.\u201d\n\nHe cited deals such as Comcast\u2019s pending acquisition of Time Warner Cable and AT&T\u2019s proposed purchase of DirecTV.\n\nTW Telecom employs nearly 3,400 people, including 1,300 in Colorado. Level 3 employs about 10,000, including 2,700 in the state.\n\n\u201cScale matters,\u201d said Herda, who has helmed TW Telecom since 1998. \u201cIt helps drive lower costs and our ability to compete with large and growing competitors.\u201d\n\nThe companies expect to save $240 million a year in operating costs and investment expenses.\n\n\u201cFrom a head-count and a non-head-count perspective, obviously we have the normal synergies \u2014 common corporate duplication \u2014 but the idea is to make sure we keep the sales force we have,\u201d said Level 3 chief financial officer Sunit Patel.\n\nThe deal is valued at $7.3 billion with the assumption of $1.6 billion in TW Telecom debt. Level 3 is paying $10 in cash and 0.7 of a share of Level 3 stock for each TW Telecom share.\n\nLevel 3 stock dropped 4 percent Monday, an indication that shareholders may be concerned that TW Telecom, long rumored to be on the block, will attract another bid. That could force Level 3 to sweeten an offer that values TW Telecom\u2019s stock at a 12 percent premium over Friday\u2019s closing price.\n\n\u201cBoth of them are seeing good momentum in the North American enterprise space,\u201d said Donna Jaegers, an analyst with D.A. Davidson & Co. \u201cThis should just continue that momentum.\u201d\n\nIn an interview Monday, Level 3 executives said the acquisition shouldn\u2019t disrupt the company\u2019s recent financial turnaround. The company has posted two straight profitable quarters after years of losses.\n\n\u201cWe continue to feel good about our outlook,\u201d Patel said.\n\nHe said integration should be less complex than Level 3\u2019s 2011 purchase of Global Crossing, which had international operations. During the two years after that deal closed, Level 3 implemented at least two rounds of job cuts, shedding more than 1,000 positions.\n\nStorey said Level 3\u2019s network reaches only about 10 percent of the 21,000 buildings that are connected to TW Telecom\u2019s network.\n\n\u201cOur businesses are very complementary,\u201d Storey said.\n\nAndy Vuong: 303-954-1209, avuong@denverpost.com or twitter.com/andyvuong", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Level 3 to acquire TW Telecom for $5.7 billion, CEO Herda to exit", "title": "Level 3 to acquire TW Telecom for $5.7 billion, CEO Herda to exit", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/06/16/level-3-to-acquire-tw-telecom-for-5-7-billion-ceo-herda-to-exit/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130411__level-3p1.jpg", "height": 463}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130411__level-3p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-16T07:34:28+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T04:51:27+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda6fc\"", "article_summary": "Long-time TW Telecom CEO Larissa Herda will not join Level 3 after the deal closes, scheduled for the fourth quarter, pending regulatory approval.\nLevel 3 is paying $10 in cash and 0.7 of a share of Level 3 stock for each TW Telecom share.\nTW Telecom has fiber-optic connections into thousands of office buildings in major metro areas that Level 3 doesn\u2019t currently reach.\nThe deal is valued at $7.3 billion with the assumption of $1.6 billion in TW Telecom debt.\n\u201cWe know our primary competitors are very large companies, whether they\u2019re incumbent telcos or cable companies,\u201d Level 3 CEO Jeff Storey said Monday during a conference call with analysts."}
