So what gives?\n\nLast June, the head of ICE\u2019s removal operations explained to Congress that so-called border removals occur whenever ICE deports an individual within three years of entry \u2013 regardless of whether the initial entry was authorized \u2013 or whenever an individual is apprehended by Customs and Border Protection. That means anyone apprehended by CBP counts as a border removal \u2013 regardless of how long they\u2019ve lived in the United States. Because CBP refuses to screen the individuals it apprehends for their ties to the U.S., and DHS overuses procedures that bypass deportation hearings before a judge, many \u201cborder removals\u201d are never fully assessed to determine whether they have a legal right to stay.\n\nDon\u2019t be fooled by the word \u201cborder\u201d in CBP\u2019s name. The agency operates in a vast zone stretching 100 miles from any land or sea border. This includes entire states like Florida and Maine as well as almost all of the country\u2019s top metropolitan areas. CBP\u2019s unnecessary, and massive, militarization of the border region has produced rampant abuses ranging from racial profiling to excessive force. CBP uses interior checkpoints and roving patrols located far from the border to apprehend individuals who are not recent border crossers by any stretch of the imagination. Data from 2011, the most recent publicly available, show that a quarter of CBP apprehensions took place more than 20 miles from a border.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be fooled by the word \u2018border\u2019 in [Customs and Border Protection]\u2019s name. The agency operates in a vast zone stretching 100 miles from any land or sea border.\u201d Chris Rickerd, ACLU\n\nThat matters to families like Alfredo\u2019s. In February, Alfredo was referred to the Border Patrol after Ohio police stopped a car he was riding in. There\u2019s one obvious problem with this: Ohio\u2019s only border is in the middle of Lake Erie. Alfredo\u2019s case, recently brought to light by America\u2019s Voice , would count as a border removal. He\u2019s lived in the U.S. for 24 years, since he was 16, but he was deported 14 years ago. His U.S. citizen spouse at the time \u2013 nine months pregnant with their first child \u2013 urged him to return. Since then, Alfredo has taken care of his family, with no arrests or other problems.\n\nIs this the profile of a recent border crosser?\n\nDHS claims that its border removals do not target recent entrants with deep family ties to the United States. A recently published report from the ACLU of New Mexico, \u201cTorn Apart: How U.S. Immigration Policy Fragments New Mexican Families,\u201d shows how untrue that is.\n\nHere\u2019s one example: After 8 years living in New Mexico, 16-year-old Sergio was picked up by Border Patrol on his way to harvest lettuce, 70 miles from the border. That morning his widowed mom, Esperanza, sent him out the door with a lunch. The next time she spoke with Sergio, he was more than a thousand miles away in Central Mexico, a country he knows little about. Sergio\u2019s deportation hit his two younger brothers hard, especially six-year-old Israel. When he sees one of Sergio\u2019s belongings around the house, he picks it up and asks Esperanza when she\u2019ll bring Sergio back.\n\nStories like Sergio\u2019s show that deporting people without considering their individual circumstances is callous and inhumane. It is damagingly inaccurate for DHS to assert that everyone caught within 100 miles of a border lacks ties to the United States. Indeed, the Migration Policy Institute recently reported that \u201ca high proportion of \u2026 border crossers are likely to be long-time non-citizens who are returning to the United States \u2026 because they have homes and families here.\u201d\n\n\u201cDHS must stop misleading the press and public about recent border crossers and border removals. \u2026 It benefits no one to deport productive members of the community.\u201d Chris Rickerd, ACLU\n\nDHS must stop misleading the press and public about recent border crossers and border removals. A person\u2019s unique situation and ties to the United States should matter more than which agency apprehended her and where it occurred. The government should always take into consideration how a person\u2019s deportation will affect their family members and the communities they contribute to daily. It benefits no one to deport productive members of the community.\n\nDHS is currently conducting a review of its enforcement practices. The stated goal was to make the process more humane. President Obama has unfortunately delayed any action on this review until the end of the summer. This delay gives him more time to consider the cruelty and absurdity of our current approach to the tens of thousands of \u201crecent border crossers\u201d we deport every year despite longstanding ties to the United States.\n\nDHS\u2019s obfuscation about recent border crossers is intended to conceal its harsh and indiscriminate deportation record, but Alfredo\u2019s and Sergio\u2019s ordeals tell the true story: many recent border crossers are nothing of the sort.\n\nChris Rickerd is Policy Counsel with the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s Washington Legislative Office.
