(Evan Vucci/AP)\n\nTIME TO WAKE UP ON VLAD\n\nWhy do we put up with Putin?\n\nMy family used to own a business in Ukraine. Now they own a business in Russia. No, they didn\u2019t move, but the political mood did when Crimea became part of Russia.\n\nIn February, Vladimir Putin put unmarked, masked forces on the ground in Ukraine, turning the rest of the world into helpless fools. No one could definitively say if they were Russian soldiers or not. Right.\n\nOn Thursday, a Buk missile system was smuggled from Russia into Ukraine. Later that day, pro-Russian dissidents committed an unthinkable act of terrorism and shot down a commercial airliner using a Buk, which they bragged about.\n\nPutin can\u2019t put black masks on the perpetrators this time because he\u2019s one of them. Time for us to take our masks off, too. He\u2019s no longer just a thug \u2014 he\u2019s now a war criminal.\n\nSean Bergin, TV reporter for News 12 New Jersey, made ignorant, racially charged comments. (\u00a9 Fox News )\n\nRAGING MORON ON TV\n\nIf ever a guy should wear a disguise to cover his ignorance, it\u2019s News 12 New Jersey reporter Sean Bergin.\n\nThe reporter, who is neither black nor a single mother, said, \u201cThe underlying cause of all of (anti-cop hatred), of course: young black men growing up without fathers. Unfortunately, no one in the news media has the courage to touch that subject.\u201d\n\nMaybe that\u2019s because it\u2019s completely without basis.\n\nThen, in his own defense, Bergin said he\u2019d gone \u201coff the reservation\u201d \u2014 another slur of an ethnic group with which he has no affiliation.\n\nUnless this yutz grows a pair \u2014 of breasts, I mean \u2014 or changes the color of his skin, he hasn\u2019t a clue. As a single mother, his remarks disgust me.\n\nSorry, Sean, you\u2019re no Bill O\u2019Reilly, and the plump, fiery white guy role is already occupied by Rush Limbaugh.\n\nMayor de Blasio promised a full investigation into the circumstances surrounding the death of Eric Garner in Staten Island. (Spencer Platt/Getty Images)\n\nNOT DERAILED, JUST DE BLASIOED\n\nMayor de Blasio correctly postponed his family trip to Italy after the horrific choking death of Eric Garner, and he probably should stay through the funeral. However, earlier, the media was all over him for not canceling the family trip to Italy because of the looming LIRR strike. No. The mayor doesn\u2019t control the MTA, and only recommends four of 22 appointments on the board. One reporter noted that Rudy Giuliani, critical of de Blasio\u2019s decision, had himself been so busy as mayor that he didn\u2019t even have time for his family. Right. Only for his mistress.\n\n10,000-year-old rock paintings supposedly depicting aliens and UFOs were found in Chhattisgarh, India.\n\nALIENS FROM INDIA\n\nThe Times of India reported that archeologists in Chhattisgarh have confirmed that cave paintings of UFOs and aliens (of the outer space kind) decked out in space suits are about 10,000 years old. Since, shockingly, Chhattisgarh doesn\u2019t have any UFOlogists on er, board there, they are bringing in NASA. What? Why don\u2019t they call on Giorgio Tsoukalos and Erich von Daniken? Not only would \u201cAncient Aliens\u201d pay for the research, we loyal viewers could discover once and for all whether Giorgio\u2019s hair is alien or human. Better: If that shirt that \u201cAliens\u201d contributor David Childress never takes off is also 10,000 years old.\n\nLUBETUBE\n\nOh, those nutty Calis. A new female lubricant, Foria, made with cannabis oil, is now on the market \u2014 but only in California. The pot lube is supposed to relax women and lead to multiple orgasms. And remember, if you bring it to New York, do not smoke it \u2014 not even for medicinal purposes.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Linda Stasi", "twitter": {"description": "Last week, Rupert Murdoch, the king of all media, bid 80 billion big ones to buy Time Warner, which includes the whole TV behemoth \u2014 Warner Brothers, HBO, CNN and you name it.", "title": "Stasi: Ideas for Rupert Murdoch's TV takeover", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/stasi-ideas-rupert-murdoch-tv-takeover-article-1.1873495", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1873440.1405829274!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/stasi20n-16-web.jpg", "site": "@nydailynews", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-author": "Linda Stasi", "parsely-type": "article", "sailthru.credits": "NEW YORK DAILY NEWS", "parsely-pub-date": "2014-07-20T04:43:28", "parsely-link": "http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/stasi-ideas-rupert-murdoch-tv-takeover-article-1.1873495", "parsely-title": "Stasi: Ideas for Rupert Murdoch's TV takeover", "sailthru.date": "2014-07-20T00:43:28-0400", "sailthru.title": "Stasi: Ideas for Rupert Murdoch's TV takeover", "nydn_section": "U.S.", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1873440.1405829274!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/stasi20n-16-web.jpg", "description": "Last week, Rupert Murdoch, the king of all media, bid 80 billion big ones to buy Time Warner, which includes the whole TV behemoth \u2014 Warner Brothers, HBO, CNN and you name it.", "robots": "NOARCHIVE", "fb": {"admins": 1594068001, "app_id": 107464888913, "pages": 268914272540}, "msvalidate.01": "02916AAC0DA8B068EFE01D721E03ED7E", "parsely-section": "U.S.", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NYDailyNews/"}, "sailthru.description": "Last week, Rupert Murdoch, the king of all media, bid 80 billion big ones to buy Time Warner, which includes the whole TV behemoth \u2014 Warner Brothers, HBO, CNN and you name it.", "viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"site_name": "NY Daily News", "description": "Last week, Rupert Murdoch, the king of all media, bid 80 billion big ones to buy Time Warner, which includes the whole TV behemoth \u2014 Warner Brothers, HBO, CNN and you name it.", "title": "Stasi: Ideas for Rupert Murdoch's TV takeover", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/stasi-ideas-rupert-murdoch-tv-takeover-article-1.1873495", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1873440.1405829274!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/stasi20n-16-web.jpg", "type": "article"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "78efe4f5c9935744af497772f68a0ee7"}, "nydn_byline": "Linda Stasi", "parsely-image-url": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1873440.1405829274!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/stasi20n-16-web.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbfd0\"", "article_summary": "(Photo by Robin Marchant/Getty Images) RK (Robin Marchant/Getty Images) NEW YORK, NY - SEPTEMBER 13: Kim Kardashian sighted on September 13, 2012 in New York City.\n(Photo by Mark Wilson/Getty Images) RK (Mark Wilson/Getty Images) Rutina Wesley ('True Blood') and President Obama.\nLast week, Rupert Murdoch, the king of all media, bid 80 billion big ones to buy Time Warner, which includes the whole TV behemoth \u2014 Warner Brothers, HBO, CNN and you name it.\nAlong with Time Warner comes HBO, CNN, Warner Bros. and more.\nThe New: Jenny McCarthy as a right-wing VP and former stripper who gets everything done by flashing her knock-out knockers."}
