A driver accused of being intoxicated and driving on a revoked license is charged with vehicular homicide in the death of man struck and killed Friday night while walking his dog on Gallatin Road at Litton Avenue in East Nashville.

The victim is Jerry W. Dailey, 62, of South Sixth Street in East Nashville. Police say their preliminary investigation shows Agustin Soto Jr., 25, of Lanier Drive in Madison, was driving a Mazda sedan north on Gallatin Road when he hit Dailey and his dog in the traffic lane.

He later told officers he did not see them until impact. The dog also died.

Soto appeared to be under the influence and smelled of marijuana, a police report said, and officers obtained a blood sample before booking him in jail. Heâ€™s being held in the Metro Jail on $50,000 bond on charges of vehicular homicide by intoxication.

Evidence at the scene indicated Dailey had been drinking alcohol.

Two other pedestrians have been killed on Gallatin Road this year.

In April, 57-year-old Robert Michael Conner was killed crossing the road in a motorized wheelchair near Berkley Drive in Madison. Police said the traffic signal was green for traffic at the time a van hit the man.

In May, a 71-year-old man from Michigan in town for a conference was struck by a car and killed while crossing Gallatin Road at Walton Lane. Allen Hoogewind had just gotten off the bus when he was hit in the crosswalk. Police said the driver left the scene in a a dark four-door sedan.
