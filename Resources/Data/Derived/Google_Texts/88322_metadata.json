Some years ago, the Democrats came up with a great idea: they established \u201cfact checkers\u201d within Democratic Party newspapers to spin unfortunate facts in the Democrats\u2019 favor. Today, several such \u201cfact checkers\u201d are well known. Are they reliable? Of course not. To see why, read this brilliant post by Sean Davis at The Federalist.\n\nThe Federalist published a simple fact about the Clinton Foundation\u2013a highly newsworthy entity, given Hillary Clinton\u2019s status as the presumed 45th president:\n\nBetween 2009 and 2012, the Clinton Foundation raised over $500 million dollars according to a review of IRS documents by The Federalist (2012, 2011, 2010, 2009, 2008). A measly 15 percent of that, or $75 million, went towards programmatic grants.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t speculation, it was arithmetic, based on the Foundation\u2019s tax records. And it didn\u2019t make Bill and Hillary look good. The Democrats might have let it go, except that Rush Limbaugh quoted The Federalist on the air. So it was \u201cgame on\u201d for the Democratic Party. PunditFact, an entity sponsored by the Tampa Bay Times and the Poynter Institute, undertook to fact check\u2013i.e., to feverishly spin\u2013that irrefutable fact.\n\nThe author of PunditFact\u2019s \u201cfact check,\u201d Louis Jacobson, admitted to Davis that what Davis wrote was \u201cclearly accurate\u201d and \u201ctechnically true.\u201d In my book, \u201ctechnically true\u201d means \u201ctrue.\u201d Nevertheless, PunditFact, in service of its Democratic Party funders, labeled The Federalist\u2019s arithmetic computation \u201cmostly false.\u201d Because they didn\u2019t want to see the Clintons cast in a bad light. Seriously.\n\nYou should read the entire thing here to get the whole, almost unbelievable story. Meanwhile, the lesson is that liberal \u201cfact checkers\u201d can\u2019t be trusted. At all. They are Democratic Party operatives, no more and no less, and they will be out in force in anticipation of the 2016 presidential campaign.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Power Line", "description": "The Democratic Party controls almost all of the news media.
