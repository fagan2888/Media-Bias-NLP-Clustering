Authorities have never said how Wilkie killed himself.\n\nWhether a check by Robitaille would have prevented the suicide or saved the life of Wilkie remains uncertain, Benton said.\n\nImmediately following the suicide, Benton said, an initial inquiry indicated that jail employees did what they were supposed to do regarding monitoring inmates.\n\nWilkie, who was facing charges of one count each of sexual battery and lewd/lascivious molestation and four counts of lewd/lascivious exhibition, was housed in a more restrictive area of the jail than the general population, but not the most secure area where the inmates are constantly watched, Benton said in June.\n\nTypically, she said, inmates who had problems with other inmates or are having discipline problems ended up in that section of the jail.\n\nThe other firing involved an arrest that occurred on July 26 of Daryl Tomblin. Subsequently, the State Attorney\u2019s Office declined to prosecute the case.\n\nIn a memo to Benton regarding Sapp, who was still in his new hire probationary period at the time, Maj. David Paeplow wrote that Sapp\u2019s report of the incident contained inaccuracies and that the initial report did not adequately support the arrest and was misleading.\n\nPaeplow wrote that the report stated Deputies Sapp and Richard Kilborn were conducting surveillance at a business at the time when Tomblin arrived. However, an investigation showed that the two deputies arrived there after following a vehicle to the location, Paeplow wrote.\n\nThe report also said the deputies saw Tomblin exit the business, although the evidence shows the deputies saw him some time after he left the business.\n\nSapp later said that \u201cyou don\u2019t actually have to see something to observe it,\u201d Paeplow said.\n\nPaeplow also questioned whether Sapp followed correct procedure in having a strip search conducted of Tomblin.\n\n\u201cClear, accurate report writing is of paramount importance as a law enforcement officer,\u201d Paeplow wrote. \u201cDeputy Shapp\u2019s misleading use of his own terms in a report is not acceptable at any time, especially to justify reasonable suspicion or probable cause for an arrest.\u201d\n\nReports also state that Paeplow and Kilborn questioned Tomblin, but failed to give him his Miranda rights.\n\nKilborn received a reprimand and was placed on probation for six months, records state.\n\njmeisel@highlandstoday.com\n\n(863) 386-5834", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sat, 09 Nov 2013 22:20:08 -0400", "Description": "SEBRING \u2014 A jailer who told his supervisors he checked inmates the night a prisoner committed suicide at the Highlands County Jail in June was fired last week after evidence contradicted his s", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "SEBRING \u2014 A jailer who told his supervisors he checked inmates the night a prisoner committed suicide at the Highlands County Jail in June was fired last week after evidence contradicted his s", "title": "Highlands sheriff fires jailer, deputy in suicide, drug cases", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/news/crime/highlands-sheriff-fires-jailer-deputy-in-suicide-drug-cases-20131109/", "image": {"width": 200, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/staticimage/images/new_og_icon.png", "height": 200}, "updated_time": "2013-11-09T22:20:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Highlands sheriff fires jailer, deputy in suicide, drug cases"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2013-11-09T22:20:08Z-04", "modified_time": "2013-11-09T22:20:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf3fd\"", "article_summary": "Immediately following the suicide, Benton said, an initial inquiry indicated that jail employees did what they were supposed to do regarding monitoring inmates.\nHowever, an investigation showed that the two deputies arrived there after following a vehicle to the location, Paeplow wrote.\nIn an unrelated case, Benton fired deputy Jesse Sapp last week in part because a report involving a drug arrest contained numerous inaccuracies.\nPaeplow wrote that the report stated Deputies Sapp and Richard Kilborn were conducting surveillance at a business at the time when Tomblin arrived.\nWhether a check by Robitaille would have prevented the suicide or saved the life of Wilkie remains uncertain, Benton said."}
