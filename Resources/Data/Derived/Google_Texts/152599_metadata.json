When it comes to budget issues, nobody is more respected on Capitol Hill.\n\nAnd the root of the impending government shutdown, he is reporting, goes back to the House Republican budget, authored by Rep.

President Barack Obama may very well be in denial about the federal debt, as Republicans suggest. But Speaker John Boehner and his deputies have a credibility deficit of their own.\n\nIndeed the supreme irony is the health care fight now is being resurrected on a continuing resolution or CR that is at odds itself with GOP plan six months ago.\n\nBack in March, that resolution held out the promise of repealing Obamacare but only got to balance by keeping hundreds of billions in added revenues and Medicare savings in the Affordable Care Act. It promised to protect defense spending while living with the post-sequestration caps of $967 billion set in the Budget Control Act. But to deliver on this pledge, it required such large cuts from domestic spending bills that the whole appropriations process collapsed by mid-summer.", "article_metadata": {"description": "David Rogers, the unofficial dean of the congressional press corps, has been reporting on Capitol Hill since Charlie Wilson was", "sailthru.expire_date": "2013-09-29 22:02:17 -0400", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "David Rogers, the unofficial dean of the congressional press corps, has been reporting on Capitol Hill since Charlie Wilson was", "title": "Dean Of Congressional Press Corps Pins Shutdown On Ryan Budget", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/28/david-rogers_n_4010379.html", "image": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1379255/images/o-PAUL-RYAN-facebook.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "David Rogers, the unofficial dean of the congressional press corps, has been reporting on Capitol Hill since Charlie Wilson was", "creator": "ryangrim", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1379255/images/o-PAUL-RYAN-facebook.jpg", "height": 1000}, "title": "Dean Of Congressional Press Corps Pins Shutdown On Ryan Budget", "site": "@HuffPostPol", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-09-28 22:02:17 -0400", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=4010379", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "charlie wilson david rogers,government shutdown paul ryan,David Rogers,Government Shutdown,david rogers paul ryan,Charlie Wilson's War,Congressional Press Corps,paul ryan,paul ryan budget", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "charlie wilson david rogers,government shutdown paul ryan,David Rogers,Government Shutdown,david rogers paul ryan,Charlie Wilson's War,Congressional Press Corps,paul ryan,paul ryan budget", "published_time": "2013-09-28 22:02:17 -0400", "modified_time": "2013-09-29 13:13:26 -0400"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbb85\"", "article_summary": "And the root of the impending government shutdown, he is reporting, goes back to the House Republican budget, authored by Rep.
