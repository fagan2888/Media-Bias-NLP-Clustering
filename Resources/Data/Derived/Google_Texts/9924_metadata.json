Lynch, who said it didn\u2019t contain the name, address and phone number of the person filing the document and didn\u2019t indicate that an authorized official placed the verifying signatures under oath. The petition had 365 signatures, exceeding the 225 that was needed.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to seek legal counsel on how it needs to be worded and we\u2019re going to get it approved,\u201d said Jason Bolt, a spokesman for the opposition group.\n\nThe opposition began in early July after the Galena City Council approved the acquisition of the 160-acre tract and related ordinances to build the landfill.\n\nBrian Jordan, of Jordan Disposal Service, gave the land to Galena, with the requirement that he would have a perpetual contract to operate the landfill.

Cherokee County Attorney Nathan Coleman said an investigation by his office didn\u2019t find any violations of the state\u2019s open meetings law, although council members agreed to participate in training on the law.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "News, State, The Associated Press, Jason Bolt, Oliver K.
