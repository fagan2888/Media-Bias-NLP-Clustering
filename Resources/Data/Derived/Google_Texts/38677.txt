>>> AS WITH MANY PARTS OF OUR LIVES, THE INTERNET AND THE NEWS SHARING ECONOMY HAVE REVOLUTIONIZED THE IDEA OF HOME AWAY FROM HOME.

THERE'S PAIN IN ALL THIS AS WE HEAR FROM JOE FRYER. >> Reporter: FOR $60 A NIGHT YOU CAN RENT A ROOM IN LINDA'S PORTLAND HOUSE. >> HERE'S THE ROOM. >> Reporter: SHE USES THE WEBSITE AIR B & B WHICH CONNECTS TRAVELERS WITH THOSE LOOKING TO MAKE MONEY BY RENTING OUT ROOMS OR HOMES. >> I MEAN, THERE'S NOT BEEN ONE BAD EXPERIENCE. >> Reporter: AIR B & B SCREENS THE HOSTS AND GUESTS, BUT ON OCCASION THERE'S PROBLEMS. THE COMPANY REIMBURSED A WASHINGTON MAN AFTER RENTERS TRASHED HIS HOUSE. AND IN PALM SPRINGS, CALIFORNIA, THIS LANDLORD RENTED HER CONDO TO A MAN FOR 44 DAYS AND NOW SAYS HE'S SQUATTING. SHE SHARED HER STORY WITH A JOURNALIST FROM BUSINESS INSIDER. >> EVERY TIME SHE CONTACTED ME SHE WAS EXTREMELY FRUSTRATED. SHE COULDN'T GET HIM OUT. AND ALL OF HER REAL ESTATE FRIENDS HAD SAID, HEY, LISTEN, YOU NEED TO LAWYER UP. >> Reporter: BECAUSE THE RENTAL WAS LONGER THAN 30 DAYS, HE'S NOW CONSIDERED A TENANT AND MUST BE EVICTED, WHICH TAKES TIME AND MONEY. AIR BNB SAYS IT PAID FOR THE FULL COST OF THE RESERVATION AND IS OFFERING LEGAL SUPPORT. THE COMPANY SAYS MORE THAN 17 MILLION GUESTS HAVE HAD A SAFE POSITIVE EXPERIENCE. AND AS THE BUSINESS GROWS IN POPULARITY, CITIES ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO REGULATE IT. THE BIGGEST BATTLEGROUND IS NEW YORK CITY WHICH HAS AN ILLEGAL HOTEL LAW.
