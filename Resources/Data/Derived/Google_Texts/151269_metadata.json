I must have been six or seven years old, scurrying around the lunch or dinner table. Johannesburg, early \u201970s. I remember her bearing and keen gaze, her straight posture and straight talk. Nadine Gordimer chose her words carefully, and when she spoke people listened. The voice, the accent, told her story: arid gold mining town, Lithuanian watchmaker father, English mother. An outsider \u2014 Jewish, the child of foreign parents, female \u2014 she was educated by a tutor, read and wrote compulsively and published her first short story at the age of fifteen.\n\nWhen I was in college in America, I began an intermittent epistolary relationship with Nadine, first about her writing and then about mine. I was probably the only freshman in my literature class who thought of her novel \u201cMy Son\u2019s Story\u201d when I read \u201cThe Tempest,\u201d so I wrote to tell her so. (Caliban: \u201cYou taught me language; and my profit on\u2019t. Is, I know how to curse.\u201d) I screwed up my courage and sent the first short story of mine that I thought worthy of her time, and she wrote back that it perfectly captured the gap between \u201cprivilege and privation\u201d in South Africa. That letter sent me back to my Apple LC in a happy hurry. Another story, an attempt at frugal prose and a setting further afield, elicited a succinct reply: don\u2019t try to be a Japanese writer. We met in New York; we met in Johannesburg. Every time I wrote to her, she wrote back, a letter typed on a manual typewriter that left divots in the thin airmail parchment. When my novel was published in South Africa last year, she wrote a blurb (shout, they call them there) that made me jump for joy.\n\nAre there many writers who fight for a cause, chronicle that cause and eventually outlive that cause? Nadine was that writer; she spans the Struggle. Her 1963 work, \u201cOccasion for Loving,\u201d is about a white woman who has a relationship with a black man, something that was illegal at the time, banned by the Immorality Act. \u201cBurger\u2019s Daughter,\u201d published in 1979, is a fictionalized account of an anti-apartheid activist and his daughter, based in part on her friend and ANC comrade Bram Fischer. The book was banned in her homeland, but a lot of South Africans read it, and a copy was smuggled to Nelson Mandela on Robben Island.\n\n\u201cJuly\u2019s People\u201d (1981) imagines the end of apartheid and penetrates the feeling of futurelessness that permeated South Africa at the time. She chose for the epigraph a line from Antonio Gramsci: \u201cThe old is dying and the new cannot be born; in this interregnum there arises a great diversity of morbid symptoms.\u201d \u201cThe House Gun\u201d (1998), \u201cThe Pickup\u201d (2001) and \u201cNo Time Like the Present\u201d (2012) are about people living in post-apartheid South Africa. She sees the world through each of her characters\u2019 eyes, and the result is writing that is taut and true.", "article_metadata": {"description": "I was scared of the great writer for too long, as young writers often are.
