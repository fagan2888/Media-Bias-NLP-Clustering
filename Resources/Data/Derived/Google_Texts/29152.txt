The Colorado exchange increased its SHOP enrollment about 50 percent this year.

HealthCare.gov may take in about 6,000 exchange coverage applications from small employers per year.

That's about 3 percent of the group application activity level the program managers were originally expecting. HealthCare.gov managers estimated in 2012 that HealthCare.gov would get about 200,000 Small Business Health Options Program (SHOP) applications per year.
