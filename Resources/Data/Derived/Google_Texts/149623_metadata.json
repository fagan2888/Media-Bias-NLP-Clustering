A recent study published in the American Academy of Neurology medical journal, Neurology, revealed that people adhering to a diet with around 20 grams of protein per day are less likely to suffer a stroke compared to those who consume a diet low in protein.\n\n\"The amount of protein that led to the reduced risk was moderate \u2014 equal to 20 grams per day,\" said Dr. Xinfeng Liu, lead author from Nanjing University School of Medicine in Nanjing, China, in a statement. \"Additional, larger studies are needed before definitive recommendations can be made, but the evidence is compelling.\" Liu and his colleagues investigated existing research that assessed a high-protein diet\u2019s relationship with stroke risk. The data included seven studies with a total of 254,489 participants, who were followed for an average of 14 years.\n\nAfter accounting for risk factors that could attribute to a stroke, including smoking and high cholesterol, researchers found that people with the highest amount of protein in their diet were 20 percent less likely to suffer a stroke compared to those with lower amounts of protein in their diet. Findings also revealed that for every additional 20 grams of protein per day people added to their diet, they were able to lower their stroke risk by 26 percent.\n\nAlthough the research team noted that a reduced risk of stroke was associated more with animal protein compared to vegetable protein, the study did not support the consumption of protein from red meat. Instead Liu suggested fish as a healthy protein source seeing as two of the studies were based in Japan where people are more likely to consume fish rather than red meat. Liu attributed protein\u2019s role in reducing stroke risk to its effect on lowering blood pressure.\n\n\"If everyone's protein intake were at this level, that would translate to more than 1.4 million fewer deaths from stroke each year worldwide, plus a decreased level of disability from stroke,\" Liu added. \"These results indicate that stroke risk may be reduced by replacing red meat with other protein sources, such as fish.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, stroke is considered the fourth leading cause of death in the United States, claiming a life every four minutes. Around 800,000 Americans suffer a stroke each year making it a major cause of adult disability. Maintaining a healthy weight, increasing physical exercise, not smoking, limiting alcohol use, and a healthy diet are all recommended prevention strategies for avoiding a stroke.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "high, protein, diet, fish, stroke", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Adding 20 grams of protein per day to your diet can help lower your risk of suffering a stroke by 20 percent.", "title": "Lower Your Stroke Risk With A High-Protein Diet", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/stroke-risk-could-drop-20-diet-high-animal-protein-especially-fish-287798", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/11/high-protein-diet.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Adding 20 grams of protein per day to your diet can help lower your risk of suffering a stroke by 20 percent.", "title": "Lower Your Stroke Risk With A High-Protein Diet", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/stroke-risk-could-drop-20-diet-high-animal-protein-especially-fish-287798", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/11/high-protein-diet.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/11/high-protein-diet.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-06-11T16:00:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-11T16:10:02-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Adding 20 grams of protein per day to your diet can help lower your risk of suffering a stroke by 20 percent."}, "article_summary": "Although the research team noted that a reduced risk of stroke was associated more with animal protein compared to vegetable protein, the study did not support the consumption of protein from red meat.\nLiu and his colleagues investigated existing research that assessed a high-protein diet\u2019s relationship with stroke risk.\nMaintaining a healthy weight, increasing physical exercise, not smoking, limiting alcohol use, and a healthy diet are all recommended prevention strategies for avoiding a stroke.\nLiu attributed protein\u2019s role in reducing stroke risk to its effect on lowering blood pressure.\nFindings also revealed that for every additional 20 grams of protein per day people added to their diet, they were able to lower their stroke risk by 26 percent."}
