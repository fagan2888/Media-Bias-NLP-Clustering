O\u2019Reilly did not take kindly to Milbank\u2019s criticisms and called him out on The Hugh Hewitt show Tuesday for \u201clying\u201d about the interview.\n\n\n\nAfter some light banter about interview prep, Hewitt asked O\u2019Reilly if he would ever invite Milbank on his show. O\u2019Reilly wasted no time in calling Milbank a \u201cweasel\u201d who\u2019s \u201cbeneath contempt\u201d and would never invite him on his show. And it\u2019s not even Milbank O\u2019Reilly has that big of an issue with, it\u2019s the fact that he works for The Washington Post.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not on a jihad against Milbank. I\u2019m on a jihad, a holy war, against declining standards of journalism. The Washington Post editors\u2026 had to know that Milbank was lying. And they had to know that he was lying for a reason, that he\u2019s a far-left zealot. It\u2019s okay to be a liberal columnist, but once you cross the line into lying to promote what you want, then the paper\u2019s got to take action.\u201d\n\nYou can listen to the audio below, via The Hugh Hewitt Show:\n\nPlease enable Javascript to listen.\n\n[photo via screengrab]\n\n\u2014 \u2014\n\nFollow Josh Feldman on Twitter: @feldmaniac", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bill O'Reilly did not take kindly to Washington Post columnist Dana Milbank's criticisms of his Super Bowl interview with President Obama, calling the Post", "generator": "WordPress 2016.21", "og": {"image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/bill-milbank.jpg", "title": "O\u2019Reilly Fires Back at Dana Milbank: Why Did WaPo Hire This \u2018Weasel\u2019?"}, "twitter": {"description": "Bill O'Reilly did not take kindly to Washington Post columnist Dana Milbank's criticisms of his Super Bowl interview with President Obama, calling the Post writer a lying \"weasel.\"", "title": "O'Reilly Fires Back at Dana Milbank: Why Did WaPo Hire This 'Weasel'?", "image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/bill-milbank.jpg", "creator": "@feldmaniac", "site": "@mediaite", "card": "summary"}, "NextGEN": "1.5.5", "date": "2014-02-04T18:57:33+00:00", "keywords": "online", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.5, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "And it\u2019s not even Milbank O\u2019Reilly has that big of an issue with, it\u2019s the fact that he works for The Washington Post.\nAfter some light banter about interview prep, Hewitt asked O\u2019Reilly if he would ever invite Milbank on his show.\nO\u2019Reilly wasted no time in calling Milbank a \u201cweasel\u201d who\u2019s \u201cbeneath contempt\u201d and would never invite him on his show.\nThe Washington Post editors\u2026 had to know that Milbank was lying.\nO\u2019Reilly did not take kindly to Milbank\u2019s criticisms and called him out on The Hugh Hewitt show Tuesday for \u201clying\u201d about the interview."}
