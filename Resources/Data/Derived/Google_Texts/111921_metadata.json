Research shows a C-section can have negative consequences for both the mom and the baby. And though childbirth experts have been pushing to reduce C-sections, their sense of urgency has not spread to many doctors or moms, who say C-sections are an important option in the process of delivering a healthy baby.\n\nSo are C-sections really that bad? Lots of women have one. It\u2019s generally considered low-risk surgery. You can barely see the scars these days. And there\u2019s some dispute about whether they really cost a lot more than a normal vaginal delivery.\n\nSo if you\u2019re wondering why some people get worked up about rising C-section rates, listen to Dr. Catherine Spong, with the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. She says birth is a natural process that prepares a baby to enter the world.\n\n\u201cIf you have a Cesarean delivery without any labor, without going through any of those processes, sometimes [babies] have problems with that transition because they haven\u2019t undergone all of those physiologic changes,\u201d Spong says.\n\nThere\u2019s a growing body of evidence that children born by C-section are more at risk for asthma, type 1 diabetes and obesity. And there are risks for the mom, so preventing first-time births by C-section is particularly important.\n\n\u201cOnce you\u2019ve had a Cesarean and you have an incision in the uterus, that incision could open, called uterine rupture,\u201d Spong says. \u201cThat can be catastrophic for both mom and that subsequent baby.\u201d\n\nThe odds of that rupture and other bleeding problems are not high, but go up with each birth.\n\nThe federal government had hoped to cap Cesarean sections at 15 percent of all births by 2010, but the country blew right past number. In Massachusetts, 23 percent of first-time moms have C-sections. But within the state there\u2019s a big range.\n\nIn the Boston area, Cambridge Hospital has the lowest rate of C-sections, at 15 percent, according to data collected by the state Department of Public Health. Tufts Medical Center has the highest rate, with 30 percent, but that\u2019s only slightly more than other prestigious teaching hospitals, such as Brigham and Women\u2019s and Beth Israel Deaconess.\n\nThe gap in rates may have something to do with the culture of these hospitals.\n\nAt Cambridge, Tufts Hospitals\n\nThe culture of childbirth at Cambridge Hospital begins in a Victorian house, across a driveway from the main hospital lobby. It\u2019s the Cambridge Birth Center. Both the hospital and birth center are part of Cambridge Health Alliance.\n\nThe center is as close to a homebirth as you can get without staying home. Dr. Kate Harney, the hospital\u2019s chief of obstetrics and gynecology, walks up a winding staircase into a room with big windows, painted a soft blue. She sits down on a four-poster bed covered with a diamond-pattern quilt.\n\nThe room \u201chas all the emergency equipment,\u201d Harney says, but it\u2019s \u201cnicely hidden away.\u201d\n\nOnly about 10 percent of pregnant women who come to Cambridge Hospital give birth in this house. Most women choose a more traditional experience in the main hospital. But Harney says the natural birth focus of the center sets the tone for all hospital deliveries.\n\n\u201cA lot of patients are initially drawn to us here because of our birth center,\u201d Harney says, \u201cso that affects how we care for patients in the hospital. We all have to be philosophically and medically ready to take care of women who have this approach to childbirth.\u201d\n\nThis approach includes:\n\nAn obstetrician, or OB, assigned to the hospital\u2019s labor and delivery unit 24 hours a day. OBs at Cambridge Hospital don\u2019t race back and forth between patients in the office and patients in labor, a pressure doctors in many hospitals with high C-section rates face.\n\nUsing family doctors and midwives, who are not trained to do C-sections, to perform almost half the births at Cambridge Hospital.\n\nHolding off on induced labor until two weeks after a woman\u2019s due date. Earlier inductions that don\u2019t progress to full labor are tied to C-sections.\n\nUsing doulas, or birth coaches, to assist in about a quarter of all deliveries.\n\nHarney says doulas are one way the hospital helps women who aren\u2019t ready for a long labor to get through it.\n\n\u201cWomen expect to come in and deliver in a few hours,\u201d she says, \u201cand what\u2019s realistic is that most labors are 12-24 hours. Patients always think it\u2019s going to be faster than it is.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a culture of avoiding C-sections at Cambridge Hospital that goes beyond the medical benefits. Jessey Buinicki, the hospital\u2019s nurse manager for maternity services, has been encouraging women to deliver vaginally for 20 years and has three daughters who are moms.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been very empowering, it\u2019s changed them from girls to women almost,\u201d Buinicki says. \u201cIn our society we don\u2019t look at that, we\u2019re all clinical and everything, but still the basic idea that you\u2019re giving birth to your child is huge and should have more weight than maybe it does.\u201d\n\nCambridge Hospital does not have a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, or NICU. So moms with high-risk deliveries who go to Cambridge would likely be sent to another teaching hospital in Boston, such as Tufts Medical Center, which does have a NICU.\n\nDr. Sabrina Craigo, the director of maternal fetal medicine at Tufts, says the NICU helps explain why its C-section rate is 30 percent.\n\n\u201cWe do 1,100 to 1,200 deliveries a year and at least half of those are high risk,\u201d Craigo says. \u201cBut those that are complicated, there\u2019s just a higher risk of having a C-section.\u201d\n\nCraigo sits in the hospital\u2019s NICU amid tiny babies nestled in heated incubators, hooked up to tubes and monitors. Fifty-five percent of babies here, on average, were delivered via a C-section. Tufts, unlike Cambridge, does not use midwives. The hospital does make every effort, says Craigo, to avoid a C-section and she agrees that C-section rates are an important quality marker. But Craigo says comparing rates for smaller hospitals that are not equipped to care for premature babies and high-risk pregnancies may make more sense.\n\n\u201cCertainly the very high C-section rate in a community setting should raise your concerns,\u201d Craigo says, offering advice for pregnant women. \u201cThe 24 weekers [very early babies] are not being delivered in any of the community hospitals, so I think that is a distinction,\u201d between the community hospitals and Tufts or other teaching hospitals.\n\nC-Section Research\n\nBut when researchers filter out the high-risk babies and just look at moms whose babies were in position for a normal vaginal delivery, some hospitals are still doing C-sections at almost three times the rate of other hospitals in Massachusetts. Why? No one seems to know.\n\nDr. Neel Shah, an OB at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, says time pressures in some hospitals may lead to more C-sections.\n\n\u201cThe decision that we\u2019re talking about is the difference between something that takes a lot of time and effort [a vaginal birth] and something that takes a lot less time and effort [a C-section],\u201d he says.\n\nShah heads a new project that\u2019s mapping the decisions leading up to a C-section. It\u2019s under the guidance of Dr. Atul Gawande, whose surgical checklists have reduced complications and deaths around the world.\n\nShah says research shows that a physician\u2019s fear of a lawsuit does not explain the difference in C-section rates. Could it be that there are more older mothers, or more women having twins, or more women who are obese, or more women with a disease that complicates their pregnancy?\n\nThese factors may help explain why women are having C-sections, but they do not explain why some doctors do more C-sections than others. Shah is reviewing the theory that C-sections have risen with the use of fetal health monitors.\n\nHe told a roomful of physicians at Beth Israel Deaconess last fall that something is wrong with childbirth practices in the U.S. because, \u201cYou guys are on the only continent on the planet with an increasing maternal mortality rate.\u201d\n\nShah says there\u2019s no proof that C-sections are the cause of rising death rates for moms during childbirth. There could be many factors. But researchers say the risk of ruptures and bleeding that increases with every additional C-section is under scrutiny. And hospitals are under increasing pressure to reduce C-sections. Public and private insurance plans are beginning to tie penalties or bonus payments to C-section rates.\n\nThere are many cases in which C-sections are the only safe way to deliver a baby. But if you are young and healthy and the hospital you plan to use does more C-sections than others in your area, you might talk to your doctor about why.\n\nCheck out our interactive tool to see how Cesarean section rates and four other childbirth quality measures differ at every hospital that performs deliveries in Massachusetts.\n\nMore:", "article_metadata": {"description": "The gap in Cesarean section rates may have something to do with the hospitals' culture.", "og": {"site_name": "commonhealth", "description": "The gap in Cesarean section rates may have something to do with the hospitals' culture.", "title": "Why Boston-Area Hospitals Have A Big Range In C-Section Rates", "url": "http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2014/01/c-section-boston-hospitals", "image": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/15/files/2014/01/1218_childbirth-quality02-620x465.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2014/01/c-section-boston-hospitals", "image": "//s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/15/files/2014/01/1218_childbirth-quality02-620x465.jpg", "site": "@commonhealth", "card": "summary", "title": "Why Boston-Area Hospitals Have A Big Range In C-Section Rates"}, "DC.date.issued": "2014-01-07", "msvalidate.01": "D02D46BAEDB3F81FC1B1DE2A8CB69551", "fb": {"admins": 1549080028, "app_id": 134067973330252}, "date": "Tue, 07 Jan 2014 06:12:46 -0500"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8f75\"", "article_summary": "Shah says research shows that a physician\u2019s fear of a lawsuit does not explain the difference in C-section rates.\nPublic and private insurance plans are beginning to tie penalties or bonus payments to C-section rates.\nThe hospital does make every effort, says Craigo, to avoid a C-section and she agrees that C-section rates are an important quality marker.\nSo if you\u2019re wondering why some people get worked up about rising C-section rates, listen to Dr. Catherine Spong, with the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.\nOBs at Cambridge Hospital don\u2019t race back and forth between patients in the office and patients in labor, a pressure doctors in many hospitals with high C-section rates face."}
