CF Global Holdings\n\nCoffee lovers and the baking health-conscious may soon be able to drink their java and eat it, too. \u201cCoffee Flour\u201d creators, CF Global Holdings, have been able to create an agricultural innovation that recycles the \u201ccoffee cherries\u201d \u2014 usually discarded during the production of coffee beans \u2014 to use as flour to add to popular baking goods. The gluten-free baking ingredient that also claims to be healthier than whole wheat delivers a caffeine hit to your palate in the form of bread, cakes, and even pasta dough.\n\nCoffee Flour jar is set to hit stores as late as 2015.

CF Global Holdings\n\nDespite its name, the taste of coffee flour doesn\u2019t resemble that of coffee at all, but rather \u201cfloral citrus and roasted fruit-type notes.\u201d Although the product delivers a caffeine kick, it is less than standard brewed coffee though, depending on how much you use, of course, the Daily Mail reported. Since the flour derives from the fruit of the plant, that helps explain why the taste is different from that of your cup of Joe.\n\nCoffee Flour superfood granola recipe contains \"floral citrus and roasted fruit-type notes.\u201d Photo courtesy of CF Global Holdings.
