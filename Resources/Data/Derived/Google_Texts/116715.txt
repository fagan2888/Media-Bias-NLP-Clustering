Brendan Fenn recently discovered something precious in the mountains of Colorado: A silver pocket watch that dates back to the 1880s â€” the days leading up to the height of the Ashcroft and Aspen silver-mining boom.

The watch represents a real connection to life 130 years ago, long before the first pair of skies touched any mountain in this area.

Just a few weeks before moving to Boston in Aug. 2012, Fenn and three buddies decided to attempt to climb two 14,000-foot peaks, Castle and Conundrum, in one day.

During the climb, the group was navigating Pearl Pass, just below the snowfields at 13,000-feet, scrambling through a scree field lined with large, loose boulders. The climb became so steep that Fenn compared it to climbing a ladder on all fours, and he needed to take a quick breather. As he caught his breath, he saw something silver glimmering near his hands.

As his eyes focused, there sitting among the thousand-pound boulders was a silver pocket watch that appeared undisturbed since Chester A. Arthur was president of the United States.
