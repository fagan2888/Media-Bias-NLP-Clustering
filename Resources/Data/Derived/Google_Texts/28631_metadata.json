The meeting was held as part of the children\u2019s advocacy week during the Florida legislative session to bring together the state\u2019s child advocacy community and draw attention to the policy needs of children.\n\nFlorida had 445,035 uninsured children in 2013, according to the most recent available data from the U.S. Census. Florida\u2019s rate of uninsured children \u2014 11.1 percent \u2014 is the highest in the Southeast and ranks 47th out of 50 states and Washington, D.C. The national average for the percentage of uninsured children was 7.1 percent in 2013.\n\nFlorida\u2019s high rate of uninsured children is an outreach problem, Alker said. Many of the uninsured children are eligible for coverage under Florida\u2019s Medicaid or children\u2019s health insurance program, known as Florida HealthyKids, which offers subsidized coverage for low-income families earning less than about $40,000 per year.\n\nBut many families don\u2019t know they are eligible for coverage, or think they are better off without any insurance than participating in the Medicaid program, which has noted problems with doctor participation and administrative headaches.\n\nStill, having Medicaid or HealthyKids coverage is much better for long-term health outcomes and economic mobility than going uninsured, Alker noted.\n\nCover the parents\n\nChildren who were covered by Medicaid insurance from birth to 18 paid more in cumulative taxes by the time they were 28 than their uninsured peers, and the government will recoup 56 cents of every dollar spent on childhood Medicaid coverage for children by the time those children turn 60, according to a new research paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research.\n\nRecent scholarship also points to the best way to drop the rate of uninsured children: cover their parents. In Massachusetts, when the state expanded insurance coverage to most adults in 2006, the state\u2019s rate of uninsured children dropped in half.\n\nThe parental coverage brings the parent into the system and often motivates parents to seek information about coverage for their children, in addition to themselves, according to the report.\n\nAlker also noted that Florida ranks 49th nationally in the number of uninsured parents. Most uninsured Florida parents are white, between the ages of 26 to 49, have one or two children, and work in the service, tourism or retail industry, according to a recent report from the Center for Children and Families at Georgetown University.\n\nEven if Florida does not expand insurance coverage eligibility to adults \u2014 parents included \u2014 by accepting federal money from the Affordable Care Act, there are steps Florida can take to reduce the number of uninsured children, including eligibility screenings when patients come to the hospital or the emergency room.\n\nOn a more positive note, advocates praised Congress for renewing the children\u2019s health insurance program, or CHIP, on Tuesday night. It is a large federal grant to states to help pay for health coverage for millions of children, including more than 400,000 in Florida through the HealthyKids program. The federal money helps cover children in families which earn 133 percent to 210 percent of the federal poverty level, or $2,643 to $4,174 per month for a family of four.\n\nExpanding coverage to children is also a way for all Floridians to save money, Alker noted.\n\n\u201cWe all pay the bill when kids end up in the emergency room with complications of preventable illnesses,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Florida\u2019s children are missing out on insurance coverage, often because their parents don\u2019t know that they are eligible, advocates said Wednesday.", "vf": {"unique_id": "art-20C170A3-0A3F-4558-B936-919F7975569A-pubSH"}, "og": {"site_name": "HeraldTribune.com", "description": "Florida\u2019s children are missing out on insurance coverage, often because their parents don\u2019t know that they are eligible, advocates said Wednesday.", "title": "Florida children missing out on insurance coverage", "url": "http://www.heraldtribune.com/article/20150415/article/150419785", "image": "http://www.heraldtribune.com/global/images/fb/SH.png", "type": "article"}, "publishdate": 20150415, "fb": {"app_id": 131646103569058}, "tout": {"article": {"id": "art-150419785-pubSH"}}, "keywords": "MANATEE COUNTY (FL),  ENGLEWOOD (CHARLOTTE COUNTY, FL),  ENGLEWOOD (SARASOTA COUNTY, FL),  VENICE (FL),  AKIAK (AK),  EEK (AK),  EKWOK (AK),  MANOKOTAK (AK),  SKWENTNA (AK),  VENETIE (AK),  Business (general),  Social Issue"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9ed6\"", "article_summary": "TALLAHASSEE - Florida\u2019s children are missing out on insurance coverage, often because their parents don\u2019t know that they are eligible, advocates said Wednesday.\nIn Massachusetts, when the state expanded insurance coverage to most adults in 2006, the state\u2019s rate of uninsured children dropped in half.\nMany of the uninsured children are eligible for coverage under Florida\u2019s Medicaid or children\u2019s health insurance program, known as Florida HealthyKids, which offers subsidized coverage for low-income families earning less than about $40,000 per year.\nFlorida had 445,035 uninsured children in 2013, according to the most recent available data from the U.S. Census.\nThe national average for the percentage of uninsured children was 7.1 percent in 2013."}
