From that vantage point, I\u2019ve come to see some of the unfortunate parallels between the Obama administration\u2019s past claims about the Affordable Care Act and the similar claims it now makes about the EPA\u2019s Clean Power Plan.\n\nWhat I\u2019ve noticed is that, in both cases, a majority of Americans end up paying more and getting less.\n\nLet\u2019s look first at who pays more. Under Obamacare, the cost of \u201creform\u201d was passed along, in the form of bigger deductibles and higher copays, to the majority of Americans who had insurance policies they liked and could afford. Likewise, it\u2019s the majority of Americans who now power their homes with affordable and reliable electricity from coal who will pay the price of the EPA\u2019s impossible carbon standards.\n\nIn part, that\u2019s because the Clean Power Plan\u2019s carbon emission targets assume the widespread adoption of carbon capture and sequestration technology by existing coal-fired power plants. Even with generous government support, however, CCS remains too costly to be commercially viable. The Department of Energy admitted this fact just last week when it abandoned FutureGen \u2014 a public-private partnership designed to demonstrate CCS in central Illinois. Amazingly, years of bipartisan support and the promise of a billion dollars in stimulus money couldn\u2019t make this project in the president\u2019s home state \u201cshovel ready.\u201d\n\nWith no coal-fired power plant in the country able to operate under the EPA\u2019s carbon threshold, electric utilities would have to turn to other, more costly energy sources. But not only will the majority of Americans pay more for electricity under the Clean Power Plan, just as they pay more for health care under the ACA, they\u2019ll also get less.\n\nLet\u2019s look at who gets less. Under the health care law, the majority of Americans have found their coverage networks shrink, offering less of a choice among doctors and hospitals. Under the Clean Power Plan, the majority of Americans could get less reliable electricity and not just less, but no credit at all for existing, zero-emission sources.\n\nGrid operators have warned the Clean Power Plan\u2019s forced closure of coal-fired power plants could compromise reliability and even lead to blackouts. While new natural gas plants could replace some of the baseload capacity generated by retired coal-burning facilities, our existing energy infrastructure is incapable of piping enough natural gas to meet current demand in some parts of the country. Given this administration\u2019s record on pipeline approvals, it\u2019s hard to imagine utilities investing in new natural gas power plants without the certainty of adequate and reliable fuel supplies.\n\nIt\u2019s not just coal that suffers under the Clean Power Plan though. Energy consumers in states such as Illinois will get no credit toward meeting the EPA\u2019s standards from existing carbon-free nuclear power.\n\nFor those fixated on reducing carbon dioxide emissions, but honest enough to admit the threat drastic cuts pose to baseload capacity, nuclear is a no-brainer. Here again, however, the president\u2019s energy policies are at odds with the majority of America\u2019s elected representatives. By kowtowing to Sen. Harry Reid\u2019s, D-Nev., fear-mongering opposition to a permanent geologic repository for nuclear waste at Yucca Mountain, the administration denies nuclear power suppliers the certainty they need to continue producing emission-free, baseload electricity.\n\nDespite all the president\u2019s rhetoric about middle-class economics, the reality is that the majority of middle-class families pay more and get less as a result of his policies. Republicans warned this would be the case under Obamacare. Will the president listen as we warn the same will be true of his environmental crusade?\n\nRep.
