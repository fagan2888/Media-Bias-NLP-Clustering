Robert Baillie, the man who killed and sexually assaulted a Colorado Springs woman 38 years ago, will spend the rest of his life behind bars.

Last week Baillie was convicted of murdering Janet Conrad back in 1976.

The murder conviction comes with a mandatory life sentence, according to a law that went into effect in 1976.

On Friday, a judge decided that Baillie can apply for a parole hearing, but not until he's been behind bars for 10 years for his crime. Even then the judge said it's unlikely that he will ever be granted a parole hearing.

Janet Conrad's murder was a cold case, left unsolved for almost 40 years until DNA evidence tied Baillie to the murder.

Baillie was already serving a life sentence for an unrelated sexual assault, but was up for parole this year.

"The process is over and ... there's peace," said Ray French, the son of Janet Conrad.

"I hope that it does bring closure. At least they know, at least they know who did it and it's not just an unsolved mystery," said Jessica Lott, Baillie's niece.

Baillie did not speak at his hearing Friday; his lawyer spoke, saying that he maintains his innocence and is saddened by the loss the Conrad family suffered.

Baillie's attorney tells 11 News that they are in the process of appealing the conviction.
