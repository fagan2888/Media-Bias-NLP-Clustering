Business owners are suing the government over one small clause in the law, arguing that the wording does not permit poor people in 36 states to obtain government-funded health care and would allow the IRS to saddle small businesses with massive penalties. (RELATED: Obamacare back in court Tuesday).\n\nLee asked Tecce if the plaintiffs challenging the law had a case. \u201cDo they have a case?\u201d he answered incredulously. \u201cI\u2019m going to tell you something. Before, as Dr. Krauthammer said, this \u2018lawlessness\u2019 began, this case would be a slam dunk.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very simple,\u201d he explained. \u201cWhen you talk about interpreting a statute, Jenna, the words of the statute control. And the words of the statute define this exchange as set up by a state and they authorize subsidies for exchanges as defined by the statute. And \u2014 this is the irony of this \u2014 the law presumes that Congress knew what they were doing when they passed a statute. That\u2019s the end of the conversation.\u201d\n\nTeece also pushed back against the government\u2019s \u2014 and his fellow panelist Doug Burns\u2019 \u2014 argument that the issue is simply \u201ca mistake\u201d and that the court should interpret what Congress meant, not what they wrote.\n\n\u201cWhen they wrote the section of the law that indicated who was going to get the subsidies, they specifically did not include the federal exchanges,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the end of the day, even if it was a mistake \u2014 a typo, as my learned colleague is trying to say \u2014 it\u2019s too bad, because mistakes are drawn against the drafters. . . If that\u2019s what they meant, then that\u2019s what they should have said.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is what happens when you ram a bill through with no back-and-forth, no bipartisan support,\u201d he later added. \u201cUltimately, because of the mistakes that were made, the irony is that the real, the legitimate, the lawful fix for this would be to send the law back to Congress and tell them to fix it.\u201d\n\nBoth panelists admitted that the sheer scope and importance of Obamacare politics means the judges may allow the government to continue applying the law in defiance of the law\u2019s own language. \u201cThe lawlessness has to stop,\u201d Tecce demanded.\n\nFollow Brendan on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
