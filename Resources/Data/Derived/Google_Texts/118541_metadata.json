The tendency this time is especially acute among liberals, who eagerly frame Pope Francis as one of them \u2014 a categorization Francis has resisted. \u201cI\u2019m sure that I haven\u2019t said anything more than what\u2019s written in the social doctrine of the church,\u201d he said as his plane approached U.S. soil.\n\nTo some degree, liberals are justified in linking Pope Francis to many of their concerns \u2014 climate change, wealth redistribution, poverty. And even many conservatives seem to concede this pope to the political left. In truth, however, both sides lack a full picture. To illustrate the point, I\u2019ll focus on the subject area that brings Pope Francis here to America to begin with: A major international Roman Catholic Church synod on family and marriage.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThough Francis is absolutely forgiving and charitable and merciful, including to gay people, when it comes to marriage, family and gender, this pope has been unflinchingly orthodox in support of historic church teaching. Some of his language has been even stronger than his predecessors. The extent to which that is true is at times shocking. Here are just a few examples:\n\nLast January, as nations from Ireland to America looked to redefine marriage, Francis gravely warned of the \u201cforms of ideological colonization which are out to destroy the family\u201d and \u201credefine the very institution of marriage.\u201d Echoing his predecessor, he warned of the forces of \u201crelativism\u201d that would alter family, marriage and \u201cthreaten\u201d society and humanity.\n\nShortly before that, in November, he insisted that all \u201cchildren have a right to grow up in a family with a father and a mother.\u201d This followed a vocal statement after the previous synod on the family in Rome, where Francis asserted: \u201cWhat they are proposing is not marriage, it is an association, but it is not marriage! It is necessary to say things very clearly and we must say this!\u201d\n\nHe has always been very clear in saying this. When he was a cardinal in Argentina, he declared same-sex marriage a diabolical effort of \u201cthe Father of Lies\u201d (i.e., the devil). This was July 2010, and Cardinal Jorge Bergoglio blasted a bill to legalize same-sex marriage and gay adoption in Argentina. He said, \u201cLet us not be naive: This is not simply a political struggle, but it is an attempt to destroy God\u2019s plan. It is not just a bill (a mere instrument) but a \u2018move\u2019 of the father of lies who seeks to confuse and deceive the children of God.\u201d He added ominously, \u201cAt stake is the identity and survival of the family: father, mother and children. At stake are the lives of many children who will be discriminated against in advance, and deprived of their human development given by a father and a mother and willed by God.\u201d\n\nParticularly notable has been Francis\u2019s constant emphasis on the differences and complementarity of men and women as parents and spouses. His words here could scandalize liberals. His condemnation of \u201cso-called gender ideology\u201d has been extraordinary. \u201cGender ideology is demonic!\u201d Francis shouted at one interviewer. He has compared gender theory to \u201cthe educational policies of Hitler.\u201d\n\nIn this, Francis has taken an activist role, serving as the spiritual inspiration for a gigantic June 20 demonstration at St. John Lateran, the official church of his Rome diocese. Its purpose was to halt the introduction of gender theory into Italian public schools. This massive \u201cFamily Day\u201d rally was a reflection of Pope Francis\u2019s Year of the Family, and it came only four days after the pope\u2019s environmental encyclical, \u201cLaudato Si.\u201d They were marching not against global warming but gender ideology.\n\nThis is a mere snapshot of Francis\u2019s statements. He has done almost two dozen general audiences on the family. Tellingly, right before leaving Rome for the synod on the family in Philadelphia, he again affirmed the \u201cimage of the family \u2014 as God wills it, made up of one man and one woman,\u201d which, he said, \u201cis deformed through powerful contrary projects supported by ideological colonizations.\u201d\n\nAlas, what I\u2019ve laid out here on Pope Francis and marriage likewise could be done for the cause of unborn children. His forceful denunciations of the \u201cthrowaway culture\u201d of abortion are equally emphatic, as is his belief in forgiveness for those who repent of abortion.\n\nWhat does this mean? It means you shouldn\u2019t cherry-pick this pope. You can\u2019t grab this or that statement that fits your personal political-ideological preferences and think you have the full picture. The Francis picture has many shades.\n\nThis pope is neither liberal nor conservative. This pope is Catholic.\n\nKengor is professor of political science at Grove City College in Grove City, Pa.
