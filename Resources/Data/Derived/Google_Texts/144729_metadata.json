Cleveland, host of this summer\u2019s Republican convention, is the No. 1 most economically distressed large city in America, with 53 percent of adults not working, according to an analysis by The Economic Innovation Group, a nonprofit research group.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cI am mystified when he talks about fixing the economy,\u201d said Amy Hanauer, executive director of the left-leaning think tank, Policy Matters Ohio. \u201cOhio added the smallest share of jobs out of the 38 states, including the District of Columbia, with job growth from 2007 to 2015. It is interesting to me that he has managed to portray the economy as being really good because it is not.\u201d\n\nKasich\u2019s survival in the GOP presidential sweepstakes hinges on whether he can deliver a native-son victory in this bellwether state. But the disconnect between the Ohio miracle he describes on the campaign trail and the reality of some voters\u2019 lives could cost him that home-state advantage.\n\nMost polls show the two-term governor trailing GOP front-runner Donald Trump, albeit by just a few percentage points. Although Kasich was elected governor twice and has high favorability ratings, some complain his campaign has exaggerated his economic record.\n\n\u201cI want Ohio to succeed as much as anybody, but you can\u2019t just cherry pick numbers and call it a comeback,\u201d says Gavin DeVore Leonard, state director for One Ohio Now, a coalition that advocates for expanded public services and fair budgets.\n\nTo be sure, this heavy manufacturing state has rebounded after being hit hard by the recession. But that was part of a national economic recovery and it left behind many Ohioans, especially the low-wage and manufacturing workers who have flocked to Trump in states like Michigan, where Kasich campaigned so long he joked he should pay taxes.\n\nKasich \u201cdeserves some credit for the economic recovery because he has vigorously pursued job creation, but I\u2019m not sure he deserves quite as much credit as his campaign has claimed,\u201d says John Green, a professor of political science at the University of Akron.\n\nOthers say Kasich singled out one data point from Ohio\u2019s employment numbers to cast himself as the ultimate job generator, instead of as someone who benefited from the tailwinds of an improving national economy.\n\nAnd while he cut income tax rates twice and eliminated the state\u2019s estate tax, he also raised sales and cigarette taxes \u2014 levies that hit the pocketbooks of all Ohioans, especially low-income ones.\n\n\u201cWe were in the abyss\u201d after the governorship of former Gov. Ted Strickland, says Kasich campaign spokesman Rob Nichols. \u201cThe fact that the economy got better under Gov. Kasich is indisputable.\"\n\nJobs\n\nJob growth did accelerate under Kasich\u2019s watch but he took office at the beginning of the national economic recovery and as the national economy improved, so did Ohio\u2019s.\n\nOhio\u2019s jobs picture began to pivot the year before Kasich took office, when the number of employed Ohioans started to rise and unemployment began to fall, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. In the 12 months before Kasich was sworn in in January 2011, the state unemployment rate fell from 11 percent to 9.2 percent.\n\nSince he\u2019s been governor, the state\u2019s employment picture has continued to improve, paralleling the national recovery. (The national unemployment rate now stands at 4.9 percent, whereas Ohio\u2019s was at 4.8 percent in December 2015, the latest data available at the state level).\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to paint a picture of economic dynamism, or complete economic devastation that can be pinned on the governor,\u201d says Susan Helper, a professor of economics at Case Western Reserve University in Ohio and former chief economist for the U.S. Commerce Department under the Obama administration. \u201cNational and global forces are the main things that are responsible, especially for short-term unemployment rates.\u201d\n\nStill, conservative politicians give Kasich the credit for placing the state on firmer financial footing.\n\n\u201cOverall, Ohio\u2019s economic environment is sound,\u201d says Republican House Speaker Cliff Rosenberger. \u201cIt\u2019s like an apples and oranges comparison to the leadership who was here before,\u201d referring to the previous Democratic administration.\n\nOhio\u2019s rate of job growth has been much lower than the nation\u2019s since the recession began in 2007, according to an analysis done by the Democratic-leaning think tank, Policy Matters Ohio. The group points out that 11 out of the state\u2019s 12 most common jobs pay less than $40,000 a year.\n\nOther signs of Rust Belt decline are evident: The state\u2019s employment numbers peaked in 2000 with a little over 5.6 million jobs\u2014and have never returned to that level, according to the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services, a state agency.\n\nAutomakers and auto part suppliers make up the biggest base of local manufacturers.\n\nBut unions like the local UAW hate Kasich for criticizing the government-backed bailout of Chrysler and General Motors in 2009. Yet now, they say, he takes credit for Ohio\u2019s job creation, powered in part by the auto recovery.\n\n\u201cIf the auto industry had not come back, we would not see these jobs come back,\u201d says Ken Lortz, who oversees Ohio and Indiana for UAW Region 2-B which includes roughly 46,000 members in Ohio. \u201cThe governor has been in office since 2011, and I have yet to have a conversation with him.\u201d\n\nKasich also created a new, private state entity called JobsOhio, responsible for the state\u2019s economic development. The entity has been controversial among both liberals and the state auditor because Kasich exempted it from public record laws, meaning that Ohioans have no idea about the deals it cuts with taxpayer dollars to entice businesses.\n\nState economists and academics wonder whether Kasich has done enough to diversify the state\u2019s economy. \u201cWe used to refer to Ohio as the Rust Belt, but it\u2019s no longer the Rust Belt because all of the old industries have rusted out,\u201d says Green, the political science professor. \u201cClearly, there is a lot more to be done and sustained job growth is necessary. We\u2019ve had a hard time for a long time in managing that.\u201d\n\nBudget\n\nOne of Kasich\u2019s favorite campaign talking points is that he inherited an $8 billion hole yet managed to balance Ohio\u2019s budget. That figure was actually a forecast by Kasich\u2019s budget director, who had anticipated stagnant state revenues despite the economic upswing the state was beginning to experience.\n\nBoth the national fact-checking operation Politifact and the Cleveland Plain Dealer estimate the budget shortfall before Kasich took office was somewhere between $6 to $8 billion.\n\nBut Kasich repeated the $8 billion figure so often that it became an accepted truth in Ohio and on the campaign trail.\n\n\u201cThe long and short of it is that we were staring down a huge shortfall, and there was no way to fund all of those things at the same level,\u201d says Andrew Doehrel, president and CEO of the Ohio Chamber of Commerce, who reached out to POLITICO at the request of the Kasich campaign.\n\nKasich also boasts about balancing the budget but the state constitution mandates a balanced budget, so he is hardly the first Ohio executive to pass a balanced budget with the help of the state Legislature.\n\nTaxes\n\nOn the tax front, Kasich deserves credit for cutting taxes\u2014though that is hardly as black and white as he portrays it.\n\nHis administration cut income tax rates by 10 percent in 2013 and by another 6.3 percent in 2015 and eliminated the estate tax. However, it paid for those cuts by increasing the sales tax (a move frowned upon by budget experts for disproportionately hitting lower-income people) and doing an end-run around the Republican-dominated state Legislature to expand Medicaid, which resulted in an infusion of billions of federal dollars from Obamacare.\n\nConservatives universally applauded the slashing of the income tax rates, as did local manufacturers, many of which structure their companies so they file taxes through the personal income, and not the corporate side of the tax code.\n\n\"We viewed the cuts as a business stimulus,\u201d said Ryan Augsburger, chief lobbyist of the Ohio Manufacturers' Association.\n\nRepublicans in the statehouse rejoiced over the tax-cut package and the fact they were able to slash taxes by $5 billion -- with the top tax rate the lowest it\u2019s been since 1982, says Republican House Speaker Cliff Rosenberger.\n\nLiberal advocates pointed out that the wealthiest Ohioans saw the biggest gains, with a $17,000 average reduction in their tax burden, whereas the taxes of low-income people stayed roughly the same or slightly increased, thanks to the higher sales tax.\n\n\u201cOverall, the tax environment in Ohio has decreased,\u201d Rosenberger says. And because the expansion of Medicaid and its accompanying federal dollars paid, in part, for the tax cuts, Republicans have found some peace with it \u2014 even those who vehemently oppose Obamacare.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t agree with him taking federal government money\u201d for expanding Medicaid, says Ohio Senate President Keith Faber, a Republican. But taking federal money ultimately saved the state millions, he said. \u201cCandidly, the governor was right. He took it and we put it into tax cuts and workforce training.\u201d\n\nLiberals give Kasich huge praise for pushing the expansion of Medicaid against the wishes of his own party with the help of a hand-picked health board. The move brought health insurance to roughly 500,000 low-income residents and pumped over $6.5 billion into state coffers over the course of two and half years.\n\n\u201cIt has made a tremendous difference in people\u2019s health and in the amount of money it has saved the state,\u201d says John Corlett, the former Ohio Medicaid director under Strickland, who now oversees a nonpartisan think tank.\n\nThe irony is that it\u2019s far easier for Kasich to talk about Ohio\u2019s resurgence than his role in helping to implement a piece of Obama\u2019s signature, sweeping health care reform policy.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "John Kasich talks about the state's comeback, but some residents haven't experienced it.", "title": "The myth of Ohio's economic miracle", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2016/03/ohio-miracle-john-kasich-220652", "image": "http://static.politico.com/72/29/64e061f34924ac372f7a70032dae/160311-kasich-jobs-ap-1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "John Kasich talks about the state's comeback, but some residents haven't experienced it.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cOverall, Ohio\u2019s economic environment is sound,\u201d says Republican House Speaker Cliff Rosenberger.\nYet now, they say, he takes credit for Ohio\u2019s job creation, powered in part by the auto recovery.\nJobsJob growth did accelerate under Kasich\u2019s watch but he took office at the beginning of the national economic recovery and as the national economy improved, so did Ohio\u2019s.\nAlthough Kasich was elected governor twice and has high favorability ratings, some complain his campaign has exaggerated his economic record.\nTed Strickland, says Kasich campaign spokesman Rob Nichols."}
