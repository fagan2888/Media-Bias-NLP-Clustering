Among the candidates for the GOP nod are state Dels. Barbara Comstock and Bob Marshall and past 10th Congressional District GOP Chairman Howie Lind.\n\n\n\nWhile Foust offered light praise for Congressman Wolf, expressing \u201cthere are a lot of nice things\u201d he can say about the 30-year incumbent, the Democrat fundamentally disagrees with Wolf on a host of issues, notable LGBT equality and equal pay for women, he said.\n\n\n\n\u201cDiscrimination should be eliminated from our society. The more diverse we become \u2013 and we see it in Northern Virginia \u2013 the better we become,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n\"I want to deal with our fiscal challenges, I know we can't have a massive debt that continues to grow on into the future,\" Foust continued. \"But we need to focus on investments and growing our economy \u2013 that's the most effective way to deal with a deficit in my opinion. We need to invest in job creators like infrastructure, education, research and development. We need to deal with climate change.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Democrat was encouraged by one supporter \u201cnot to run away from\" the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare.\n\n\n\n\u201c[The Affordable Care Act] clearly is a good thing,\" Foust said. \"The rollout was bad, and if there are issues with the act, then we should [fix them]. But fundamentally, the Affordable Care Act took our health care decisions away from insurance companies.\u201d\n\n\n\nOne audience member asked Foust about campaign financing, to which he responded it's essentially a tricky issue. Foust expressed an understanding for how campaign financing limits can be viewed as inhibiting free speech, but there should be some reasonable limits, he said.\n\n\n\nThe McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission Supreme Court ruling earlier this month determined campaign financing limits infringe on First Amendment rights.\n\n\n\n\u201cNow that I'm in the middle of it, it's crazy the amount of money you have to raise for a congressional campaign,\u201d Foust said. Then you have all the independent expenditures, the Koch brothers and all those guys, who have unlimited money basically.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Democrat raised more than $217,000 and held nearly $210,000 cash on hand at the close of the fourth quarter of 2013, according to his campaign.\n\n\n\nOn the Second Amendment, Foust was quick to note he's a gun owner, but he favors more stringent limitations on acquiring a firearm, including closing the so-called \u201cgun show loophole.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI think there's a lot more we can do. We should start with universal background checks. That, to me, is almost a no-brainer. I can't believe that we can't agree that we should check whether someone's a criminal or a serious threat to society before we sell them a gun,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nThe Ashby Ponds retirement community has historically had some of the highest turnout among Loudoun County precincts. Del. Comstock, the Republican front-runner, will speak at the campus Friday morning, two days after the final Republican primary debate.\n\n\n\nVirginia\u2019s 10th District is rated \"Lean Republican\" by Rothenberg Political Report/Roll Call.\n\n\n\n\n\nContact the writer at .(JavaScript must be enabled to view this email address) .\n\n\n\n\n\nComments\n\nPost a comment\n\nCommenting is not available in this channel entry.\n\nComments express only the views of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of this website or any associated person or entity.
