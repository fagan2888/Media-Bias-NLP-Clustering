A class-action lawsuit has been filed in a California federal court charging that Major League Baseball fails to protect fans from foul balls and errant bats.\n\nIt seems the new national pastime is frivolous lawsuits.\n\nThe lead plaintiff is Gail Payne, an Oakland A\u2019s season ticket-holder. The \u201cclass\u201d is every MLB season ticket-holder with an unprotected seat between home plate and the foul poles. Payne has never actually been bonked by a foul ball, so she may not even have standing to sue, since federal law requires that litigants in such suits have suffered a \u201cconcrete and particularized injury\u201d \u2014 unless her anxiety over that prospect qualifies.\n\nThe remedy she seeks is a court order commanding every MLB ballpark to hang netting from \u201cfoul pole to foul pole\u201d shielding fans along the first and third baselines all the way to the outfield walls. She cites a 2014 study by Bloomberg News claiming 1,750 spectators are injured each year at MLB games. (Yes, Bloomberg News is the creation of former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, the same billionaire nannyist who imposed a limit on the size of soft drink cups in the Big Apple during his tenure.)\n\nIn 2014, 73 million fans attended MLB games. The 1,750 who are injured constitute two one-thousandths of 1 percent of that population.\n\nSo, the question is: \u201cEven if this mandate saves only one injury, wouldn\u2019t it be worth it?\u201d I\u2019d say, \u201cHell, no!\u201d If safety is the sine qua non, your only concern that trumps everything else, you\u2019ll disagree and find solace in the official statement on this matter from MLB spokesman Pat Courtney, who said safety is \u201cour foremost goal\u201d for fans at the ballpark. That was the obligatory, politically correct answer. A reasonable concern for safety is certainly in order, but MLB is first and foremost in the baseball business, which is mostly about fan enjoyment, winning a pennant and turning a profit.\n\nFor more than 100 years, U.S. courts have recognized the Baseball Rule in liability lawsuits, maintaining that spectators are well aware of the potential danger of flying projectiles and assume that risk when they attend games. Ballparks are only obliged to provide a reasonable number of netting-protected seats. The rows directly behind home plate between the dugouts have been deemed sufficient.\n\nAs a fan, I\u2019d rather watch a game with my vision unfiltered by netting. And the thrill of catching a foul ball \u2014 or at least one that rolls to your grasp \u2014 is a constant quest. Players who pick them up from the field routinely toss them gently to kids (and adults) in the stands. Netting stretched from foul pole to foul pole would prevent that.\n\nRecall the spectacular, highlight-reel catch made by Rockies Gold Glove third baseman Nolan Arenado earlier this year in San Francisco against the Giants, diving over the tarp to snare a foul ball and flying into the stands. If there had been netting in that spot, the force of his dive might have stretched it out and, on the snap-back return, might have boinged him airborne beyond second base and into the outfield. How about player safety?\n\nWhen I go to a ballgame, I\u2019ll take my (infinitesimal) chances on an injury or even death. And If I\u2019ll risk my neck, I\u2019ll certainly risk Gail Payne\u2019s. If that\u2019s too scary for her, she can watch the games at home worrying whether her TV will blow up.\n\nAs for inattentive fans, they should take personal responsibility for their own safety. Put down your cellphone and pay attention to the game. If a foul ball comes your way and you don\u2019t want to catch it, you can always duck.\n\nFreelance columnist Mike Rosen\u2019s radio show airs weekdays from 1-3 p.m. on 850-KOA.\n\nTo send a letter to the editor about this article, submit online or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Rosen: Lawsuit against Major League Baseball is in foul territory", "title": "Rosen: Lawsuit against Major League Baseball is in foul territory", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/08/21/rosen-lawsuit-against-major-league-baseball-is-in-foul-territory/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150821__OP23ROSENp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150821__OP23ROSENp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-21T10:41:59+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T11:58:42+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Netting stretched from foul pole to foul pole would prevent that.\nIf a foul ball comes your way and you don\u2019t want to catch it, you can always duck.\nAnd the thrill of catching a foul ball \u2014 or at least one that rolls to your grasp \u2014 is a constant quest.\nA class-action lawsuit has been filed in a California federal court charging that Major League Baseball fails to protect fans from foul balls and errant bats.\nShe cites a 2014 study by Bloomberg News claiming 1,750 spectators are injured each year at MLB games."}
