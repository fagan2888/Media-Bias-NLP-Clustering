It\u2019s used as a deadline for 20-year-olds to cram all of the schooling, traveling, and falling in love they desire into one decade before they hit their 30th birthday. But now, psychology experts have given greater weight to the year because by the time you\u2019re 30, whatever personality traits you\u2019ve collected along the way are permanent.\n\n\"You're doomed! What you've got now \u2014 that's it,\" psychology professor at the University of Cambridge Brian Little, who published his book Me, Myself, And Us: The Science of Personality and the Art of Well-Being, told 30-year-old Science of Us reporter Melissa Dahl. \"At least, William James would've said that.\"\n\nLittle bases his theory on James, a Harvard psychologist who wrote in his notable book, The Principles of Psychology, in 1890, \"In most of us, by the age of 30, the character has set like plaster, and will never soften again.\" The research in the past century has only reinforced James\u2019 personality deadline, and the National Institutes of Health has even coined the term \u201cpersonality plasticity,\u201d explaining how personality traits continue to develop until the age of 30, after which time they plateau.\n\nWhat Is A Personality?\n\nWhen psychologists are talking about personality, they are usually referring to the Big Five traits that make up the core of who we are: openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. They don\u2019t really fluctuate depending on the mood or time of day, and some new research suggests those traits remain largely stable. Tiny tweaks and adjustments are made in the personality throughout our 30s, 40s, and 50s, but none compare to the first 30 years of development. Are you stubborn? Are you someone who likes to be the life of the party? Are you aware of your surroundings? Are you a go-with-the-flow kind of person? Are you an open book?\n\nIf you\u2019re over the 30 mark and don\u2019t like one of your core traits, there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019re stuck like that. Little says you can downplay certain aspects, and increase or decrease them to some degree, but it\u2019ll be an ongoing effort because personalities eventually stabilize by that age. Our maturity levels are also pretty set in stone by the time we reach 30 \u2014 if you still have time and want to improve yourself, practice becoming better until you hit the deadline.\n\n\"If we do the proper longitudinal research \u2014 we follow the same people over time \u2014 what do we see?\u201d Paul T. Costa Jr. from the National Institutes of Health, told Science of Us. \u201cWe see that the very big changes you see from early adolescence to early adulthood are greatly muted after 30, 35. There are still changes in personality after that, but they're very, very modest compared to earlier phases in the life span.\"\n\nGenetics still play a large role in your personality, but repeat behaviors can take care of that for you by the time you\u2019re blowing out your 30th birthday candles. For example, if you were shy since childhood but want to meet more people and become a more outgoing person, practice. Do the opposite of what your personality is inclined to by going to social events, introducing yourself at a party, or hosting a dinner. By the time you\u2019re 30, the personality you have may be more in line with what you want through practice and patience.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "reinvent, yourself, do, it, you, turn, 30, and, your, personality, plateaus", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Personalities become ingrained when you reach the age of 30, but is there anything you can do about it?", "title": "You Can Reinvent Yourself, But Do It Before You Turn 30", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/reinvent-yourself-do-it-you-turn-30-and-your-personality-plateaus-312624", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/01/personalities-stick-time-youre-30.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Personalities become ingrained when you reach the age of 30, but is there anything you can do about it?", "title": "You Can Reinvent Yourself, But Do It Before You Turn 30", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/reinvent-yourself-do-it-you-turn-30-and-your-personality-plateaus-312624", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/01/personalities-stick-time-youre-30.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/01/personalities-stick-time-youre-30.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Under the Hood", "published_time": "2014-12-01T15:22:19-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-01T16:19:41-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Personalities become ingrained when you reach the age of 30, but is there anything you can do about it?"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0985\"", "article_summary": "By the time you\u2019re 30, the personality you have may be more in line with what you want through practice and patience.\nBut now, psychology experts have given greater weight to the year because by the time you\u2019re 30, whatever personality traits you\u2019ve collected along the way are permanent.\nThe research in the past century has only reinforced James\u2019 personality deadline, and the National Institutes of Health has even coined the term \u201cpersonality plasticity,\u201d explaining how personality traits continue to develop until the age of 30, after which time they plateau.\nIf you\u2019re over the 30 mark and don\u2019t like one of your core traits, there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019re stuck like that.\nTiny tweaks and adjustments are made in the personality throughout our 30s, 40s, and 50s, but none compare to the first 30 years of development."}
