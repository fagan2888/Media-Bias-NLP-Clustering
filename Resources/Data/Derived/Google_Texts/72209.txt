WAYNE â€” A real estate agent in North Jersey is being sued for purposely keeping buyers away from a Wayne home so he could use it for his "sexual escapades," which were caught on hidden cameras, according to a report on NorthJersey.com.

A lawsuit filed by a Denville couple claims former Coldwell Banker agent Robert Lindsay used the house he was tasked with selling for a series of 10 trysts with fellow agent Jeannemarie Phelan from Dec. 27, 2011, to Jan. 23, 2012. The couple said Lindsay intentionally listed the home above market value to keep buyers away.

Footage of all 10 visits, captured on security cameras, show Lindsay and Phelan engaging in sexual activity, according to the report.

During the last encounter on Jan. 23, the owner of the home saw them on a live feed and called police. When officers arrived to find Lindsay pulling up his pants, he told them he was preparing for an open house, according to the report.

Coldwell Banker told NorthJersey.com that it ceased affiliation with both agents after learning of the trysts. The homeowners are seeking compensatory damages for invasion of privacy, infliction of emotional distress, breach of contract, trespass of land and other civil counts.
