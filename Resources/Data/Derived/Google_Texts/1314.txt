The booking photo of an 18-year-old man who was arrested Friday in connection with a crash that killed two women in Arapahoe County was released Saturday.

Taden Jones is scheduled to appear in Arapahoe County Combined Court on Monday at 9:30 a.m.

Jones, of Centennial, was booked Friday evening into the Arapahoe County Jail on two counts of vehicular homicide and one count each of driving under the influence, reckless driving and possession of a forged instrument.

His bond was set at $50,000, according to an Arapahoe County Sheriff’s Office media release.

The crash happened about 3:40 p.m. near the intersection of South Colorado Boulevard and East Peakview Circle.

The two-vehicle crash involved a vehicle allegedly driven by Jones, while the other vehicle had the two women inside it, the sheriff’s office said.

One woman was ejected and died at the scene. The second woman was taken to a local hospital, where she later died.

A man in Jones’ vehicle was taken to a local hospital with minor injuries. Jones and another passenger in his vehicle were not injured, the sheriff’s office said.
