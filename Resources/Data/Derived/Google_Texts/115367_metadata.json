CC By 2.0\n\nAs Venezuela reels in political and economic crisis, hospitals continue to send sick patients home from a medical system on the brink of collapse.\n\nAt Central Hospital in Maracay, doctors last month discharged some 300 cancer patients when medical supply shortages forced triage, leaving most non-emergency patients \u2014 the long-term sick \u2014 without any treatment. Among them, 37-year-old Evelina Gonzalez might be considered one of the luckier ones whose desperate plight guarantees her a chance to continue waiting for cancer surgery initially scheduled for July, the Associated Press reports.\n\n\u201cI feel like I\u2019ve been abandoned,\u201d Gonzalez told a psychologist at the hospital, her right eye swollen with glaucoma diagnosed two years ago but left untreated. Following chemotherapy for breast cancer, she began a daunting journey through the local health care system, transferring from hospital to hospital. At her latest destination, she\u2019s on a waiting list with 31 breast cancer patients awaiting surgery.\n\nCentral Hospital in Marcay last month sent 300 cancer patients home, reserving medical treatment for only emergency cases. Central Hospital, Google+\n\nDoctors in Venezuela say no government healthcare statistics have been collected since 2010, although they know for sure they\u2019re lacking medical supplies across the gamut: needles, syringes, paraffin used in biopsies for cancer diagnostics, X-ray film, imaging paper, and so forth.\n\nAlso last month, Venezuela suspended organ donations and transplants, as 70 percent of the country\u2019s radiotherapy machines clunked out of repair. In a country of nearly 30 million people, the medical shortages continue to harm many cancer patients. In an estimate from Douglas Natera, president of the Venezuelan Medical Federation, radiotherapy machine shortages may cut cancer treatment for 5,000 of the current 19,000 cancer patients requiring care.\n\n\u201cTwo months ago we asked the government to declare an emergency,\u201d Natera says. \u201cWe got no response.\u201d Likewise, Health Minister Isabel Iturria failed to respond to queries from foreign journalists.\n\nIronically, the collapse of Venezuela\u2019s medical system follows the death from cancer of the late authoritarian leader Hugo Chavez, a socialist hero to many in Latin America. Although touting one of the region\u2019s most advanced medical systems, Chavez left the country to seek late-stage cancer treatment in Cuba.\n\nAlthough Chavez\u2019 allegedly utopian socialist system had been built largely on a corruption and graft, a giant Ponzi scheme, the collapse appeared sudden following the longtime leader\u2019s death in March. Once the best funded of healthcare systems in the region, the government had cut medical money to 4.1 percent of gross domestic product by 2002, with total per capita expenditures of $386 in 2001.\n\nLast week, Venezuela\u2019s deputy health minister, Nimeny Gutierrez, denied assertions the country\u2019s medical system had reached a crisis state. Medical supplies imported from Cuba, Uruguay, Columbia, and Portugal, along with other purchases, \u201cwill let us be moderately relaxed until the end of the year,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Venezuela\u2019s opposition leader \u2014 Henrique Carpiles, defeated in the succession battle by President Nicolas Maduro \u2014 has appealed to Pope Francis, a native or Argentina, for help.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "venezuela, venezuela's medical system, venezuela medicine", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Venezuela's medical system nears collapse as the country struggles with an intense political and financial crisis.", "title": "Venezuela's Health System Verges On Collapse As Hospitals Run Short On Supplies", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/venezuelas-health-system-verges-collapse-hospitals-run-short-supplies-262145", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/11/06/venezuelas-medical-system-nears-disaster.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Venezuela's medical system nears collapse as the country struggles with an intense political and financial crisis.", "title": "Venezuela's Health System Verges On Collapse As Hospitals Run Short On Supplies", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/venezuelas-health-system-verges-collapse-hospitals-run-short-supplies-262145", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/11/06/venezuelas-medical-system-nears-disaster.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/11/06/venezuelas-medical-system-nears-disaster.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2013-11-06T14:29:54-05:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-06T14:29:53-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Venezuela's medical system nears collapse as the country struggles with an intense political and financial crisis."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc661\"", "article_summary": "Facing drastic shortages of medical supplies, Venezuela's healthcare system continues to triage patients on an emergency basis.\nLast week, Venezuela\u2019s deputy health minister, Nimeny Gutierrez, denied assertions the country\u2019s medical system had reached a crisis state.\nIronically, the collapse of Venezuela\u2019s medical system follows the death from cancer of the late authoritarian leader Hugo Chavez, a socialist hero to many in Latin America.\nMedical supplies imported from Cuba, Uruguay, Columbia, and Portugal, along with other purchases, \u201cwill let us be moderately relaxed until the end of the year,\u201d he said.\nCC By 2.0As Venezuela reels in political and economic crisis, hospitals continue to send sick patients home from a medical system on the brink of collapse."}
