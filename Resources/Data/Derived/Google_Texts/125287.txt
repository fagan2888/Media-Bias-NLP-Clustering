A Kemper County woman hit a major milestone in her life today.

Fannie Mae Cox celebrated her 102nd birthday at Mississippi Care Center in Dekalb. She was surrounded by her family. Cox was born in 1914 in Alabama. When looking back on her life, Cox says she just tried to do right by other people.

"I tried to live a life the way I would be loved and respected by everybody,‚Äù Cox says.

When asked how old she was she had a great reply.

"I'm sweet 16," she jokes.

Perhaps the most impressive thing about Cox is that she has lived this long taking no medications other than her daily vitamins.
