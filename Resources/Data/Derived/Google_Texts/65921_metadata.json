Patrick Kennedy said President Obama \u201cought to issue an executive order on himself, because you see, the president of the United States is ignoring his own law\u201d relating to mental health care.\n\nKennedy appeared on \u201cMSNBC Live with Jos\u00e9 D\u00edaz-Balart\u201d on Wednesday.\n\nDo You Agree With Patrick Kennedy?

But to ascribe violence to the whole mental health community really does a disservice to the whole issue of destigmatizing a mental illness.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t expect people to go get the help that they need if they know that they\u2019re going to be pariahs in society and that government somehow is going to examine their medical records.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is just a frightening thought,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cI think the president means well when he says he wants to give extra money, $500 million, by the way, is contingent upon Congress. But I think the president, if he really cared about mental health coverage and making sure those with mental illness weren\u2019t left out in the community without treatment, he ought to issue an executive order on himself, because you see, the president of the United States is ignoring his own law. The parity law that he voted for and is part of the ACA [Affordable Care Act] is going unenforced.\u201d\n\n\u201cInsurance companies routinely deny those with mental illness any coverage. And the president is letting insurance companies off the hook,\u201d Kennedy claimed. \u201cJust like he\u2019s letting these gun show dealers off the hook, hopefully now not anymore that he\u2019s going to now put some additional enforcement in place. But if he\u2019s going to put additional enforcement in closing the \u2018gun show loophole,\u2019 why isn\u2019t he putting additional enforcement to closing the loophole that allows insurance companies to deny those with mental illness the care that they so desperately need? So I think the president needs to be consistent here.\u201d\n\nFollow Steve on Twitter and Facebook", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Steve Guest", "description": "Former Congressman Patrick Kennedy said President Obama \"ought to issue an executive order on himself, because you see, the president of the United States is", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Former Rep.
