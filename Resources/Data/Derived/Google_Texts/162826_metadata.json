The clip below features a whole host of different Android Wear devices from different manufacturers that prove no matter what you\u2019re style, you\u2019ll find a Wear watch to match it.\n\nSome Wear watches are square like the LG G Watch and the Samsung Gear Live, while others are round like the Moto 360 and the upcoming Huawei Watch. Some are made of metal, some are made of plastic; some have silicone straps, and some have leather straps.\n\nIn comparison, Apple Watch looks almost exactly the same no matter which model you choose. Sure, Apple offers a variety of straps, but the $350 Apple Watch Sport looks identical to the $13,500 Apple Watch Edition \u2014 just not quite as expensive.\n\nOf course, which platform is right for you has little to do with choice right now; it\u2019s all about whether you\u2019re running Android or iOS on your smartphone, because neither platform supports both. But rumor has it Android Wear will support iPhone soon, and that could make it a real (and more affordable) alternative to Apple Watch for hundreds of millions of iPhone users.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Google has really ramped up its Android Wear marketing since Apple announced its launch dates for the Apple Watch, and diversity is the focus of its latest one", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "TechnoBuffalo", "description": "Google has really ramped up its Android Wear marketing since Apple announced its launch dates for the Apple Watch, and diversity is the focus of its latest one-minute ad.", "title": "Diversity is key in Google's latest Android Wear ad", "url": "http://www.technobuffalo.com/2015/03/22/diversity-is-key-in-googles-latest-android-wear-ad/", "image": "http://www.technobuffalo.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Wear-what-you-want-630x343.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "http://www.technobuffalo.com", "description": "Google has really ramped up its Android Wear marketing since Apple announced its launch dates for the Apple Watch, and diversity is the focus of its latest one-minute ad.", "title": "Diversity is key in Google's latest Android Wear ad", "url": "http://www.technobuffalo.com/2015/03/22/diversity-is-key-in-googles-latest-android-wear-ad/", "image": {"src": "http://www.technobuffalo.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Wear-what-you-want-630x343.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.technobuffalo.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Wear-what-you-want.jpg"}, "site": "@technobuffalo", "card": "summary"}, "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/technobuffalo"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Google has really ramped up its Android Wear marketing since Apple announced its launch dates for the Apple Watch, and diversity is the focus of its latest one-minute ad entitled \u201cWear what you want.\u201dBy making diversity the focus of its latest ads, Google is showcasing the one thing you cannot get from Apple Watch: choice.\nThe clip below features a whole host of different Android Wear devices from different manufacturers that prove no matter what you\u2019re style, you\u2019ll find a Wear watch to match it.\nSure, Apple offers a variety of straps, but the $350 Apple Watch Sport looks identical to the $13,500 Apple Watch Edition \u2014 just not quite as expensive.\nBut rumor has it Android Wear will support iPhone soon, and that could make it a real (and more affordable) alternative to Apple Watch for hundreds of millions of iPhone users.\nIn comparison, Apple Watch looks almost exactly the same no matter which model you choose."}
