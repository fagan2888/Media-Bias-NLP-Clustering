'Face The Nation' host Bob Schieffer grilled Republican Senator John Cornyn (R-Texas) on the government shutdown on Sunday.

Cornyn repeatedly blamed President Obama for refusing to negotiate on defunding or delaying the Affordable Care Act in exchange for raising the debt ceiling and ending the government shutdown. Cornyn referred to the president as "AWOL."

"Don't Republicans also have to do their job?" Shieffier shot back. "[It's] almost like I’m going to throw a brick through your window unless you give me $20."

Cornyn disagreed, saying that "Ted [Cruz] and I share the concern about what Obamacare is doing to our economy."

The CBS host responded: "But that's besides the point. The law has been passed. Why not keep the government running and then everybody can sit down and decide what they want to do about it?"

Cornyn again tried to lay the blame on Democrats for not allowing Obamacare cuts to be part of a shutdown solution, but Schieffer quickly cut him off.

"Senator, isn’t there something wrong when you say "I won’t fund the government unless I can attach my personal wish list to the legislation every time we vote? I’d love to see the government find a cure for cancer, but I don’t think you can say I’m not going to pass and pass any funds for the rest of the government until the NIH finds a cure for cancer. I mean, isn’t that just kind of the same thing here?"

Sunday marks the sixth day since the government shutdown began, with Democrats and Republicans barely any closer to a compromise.
