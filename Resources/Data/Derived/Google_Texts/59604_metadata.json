Bernie Sanders, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, Ohio Gov. John Kasich, and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio \u2014 are each trying to position themselves as \u201cBest Advocate\u201d for women\u2019s health.\n\nThe field is full of vast and volatile issues that mean different things to different people.\n\nWomen\u2019s health encompasses everything from abortion, Planned Parenthood and birth control, to family leave and sexual assault.\n\nAnd some of the candidates have navigated their way through this political minefield rather awkwardly.\n\nFor example, Trump, the Republican frontrunner has been sharply criticized for the crude way he\u2019s described various women such as former Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina and Fox News host Megyn Kelly.\n\nYet, he says, he\u2019s the best candidate for female voters.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to be really good for women. I\u2019m going to be good for women\u2019s health issues,\u201d Trump said during his Super Tuesday victory speech two weeks ago.\n\nClinton, who leads the Democratic race, likes to point out that she\u2019s been an advocate for women\u2019s health since she was a young activist, as an attorney, as first lady of Arkansas, as first lady in the White House, as a senator, and then as secretary of state.\n\nBut the political moderate, who recently has taken a few left turns in the wake of rival Sanders\u2019 surprising success in the Democratic primaries, has expressed skepticism in the past about the likelihood of certain women\u2019s health issues becoming law.\n\nAt a CNN town hall meeting in June 2014, Clinton said that while she supported the idea of paid family leave, she wasn\u2019t sure it was \u201cpolitically feasible\u201d to offer it to America\u2019s workers.\n\n\u201cI think, eventually, it should be [adopted],\u201d Clinton said at the time. \u201cI don\u2019t think, politically, we could get it now.\u201d\n\nSo where do each of the presidential candidates really stand on these important women\u2019s health issues?\n\nHealthline takes a close look.\n\nAbortion\n\nPeople on both sides of the emotional abortion debate are calling this election the most important one for abortion policy in decades.\n\nIf you believe abortion should remain legal and accessible, you\u2019ll probably like the Democrats\u2019 (Clinton and Sanders) positions on this issue.\n\nIf you\u2019re against abortion and believe it should be banned or at least restricted, you\u2019ll probably like the Republicans\u2019 (Trump, Cruz, Kasich, and Rubio) positions.\n\nTrump described himself as pro-choice for years. On NBC\u2019s Meet the Press in 1999 he said he was \u201cvery pro-choice,\u201d and reiterated that position in his 2000 book \u201cThe America We Deserve.\u201d\n\nBut now he describes himself as \u201cpro-life.\u201d\n\nCruz is adamantly anti-abortion and a staunch supporter of a Texas law that led to the closure of dozens of abortion clinics.\n\nImage Attribution Source: Wikimedia\n\n\n\nRubio, who supports a ban on abortion even in the case of rape, recently told Sean Hannity in a radio interview that \u201cthe science is settled. It\u2019s not even a consensus. It\u2019s a unanimity that human life begins at conception.\u201d\n\nAs Ohio governor, Kasich helped provide the first-ever state funding for rape crisis centers, but on the issue of abortion he is a hardliner.\n\nKasich has enacted multiple restrictions on women\u2019s health in Ohio and closed nearly half of the abortion providers in the state.\n\nThe Supreme Court is currently reviewing Whole Woman\u2019s Health v. Hellerstedt, which addresses a law in Texas that opponents say unconstitutionally restricts abortion access in that state.\n\nSince the Texas law was enacted, dozens of abortion clinics in Texas have reportedly closed, leaving just 17 in the large state.\n\nA new report from the Texas Policy Evaluation Project concluded that since the abortion clinics were closed, nearly 2 percent of 18- to 49-year-old women in Texas \u2014 that\u2019s anywhere from 100,000 to 240,000 women \u2014 have tried to self-induce an abortion.\n\nThe report also showed that wait times for abortion appointments increased to as long as 23 days at clinics in Austin and Ft. Worth due to clinic closures.\n\nThe court is expected to render its decision in June on this case.\n\nPlanned Parenthood\n\nAmong the most contentious issues on the campaign trail is the debate over funding of Planned Parenthood, which has more than 650 health centers nationwide.\n\nLast month, a grand jury looked into the widely publicized videos of Planned Parenthood workers secretly recorded by the Center for Medical Progress, an anti-abortion group.\n\nThe group insisted the videos show Planned Parenthood officials discussing the sale of fetal tissue. Planned Parenthood says it does not sell fetal tissue.\n\nThe grand jury ultimately cleared Planned Parenthood of any wrongdoing in the case and instead indicted the filmmakers on a felony charge of tampering with a governmental record.\n\nWhile both of the Democratic candidates support the continued federal funding of Planned Parenthood, the four Republicans in the race are against funding the organization, although Trump has waffled.\n\nIn response recently to a question about his flip on Planned Parenthood, Trump said, \u201cPlanned Parenthood has done very good work for some \u2014 for many, many \u2014 for millions of women. But we\u2019re not gonna allow it, we\u2019re not gonna fund so long as you have the abortion going on at Planned Parenthood.\u201d\n\nTrump made this declaration despite the fact that the Hyde Amendment in 1976 prohibited federal dollars from being used for abortion. That was amended in 1993 by President Bill Clinton to make exceptions in cases of rape and incest.\n\nRegardless, it appears Trump would only support funding Planned Parenthood if the organization ceased providing abortion services, which is unlikely.\n\nMeanwhile, the rest of the Republican candidates are definitive in their opposition to any funding for the organization.\n\nLast year, Cruz reportedly sent an email urging pastors to \u201cconfront this evil in our nation by praying and preaching with an unbridled passion until funding for Planned Parenthood ends.\u201d\n\nIn an op-ed piece for USA Today last August, Cruz made clear his opposition to the organization.\n\n\u201cDespite what Planned Parenthood contends, abortion procedures, not women\u2019s health, are its lifeblood. Hundreds of thousands of annual abortions generate nearly 40 percent of Planned Parenthood\u2019s clinic revenues. Simply put, Planned Parenthood is the nation\u2019s largest abortion profiteer,\u201d he said.\n\nKasich, who\u2019s cast himself as the moderate among the remaining Republicans in the race, signed legislation as governor of Ohio in 2013 that defunded the organization in his state.\n\nImage Attribution Source: Wikimedia\n\n\n\nNot surprisingly, Planned Parenthood is openly critical of all four Republican candidates.\n\nDawn Laguens, executive vice president of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, told Healthline the GOP candidates \u201call have the same plan for women's health: banning abortion, blocking over a million people from basic health care at Planned Parenthood, and slashing insurance coverage of birth control.\u201d\n\nLaguens said the GOP candidates\u2019 efforts to defund Planned Parenthood would block access for millions of women to cancer screenings, sexually transmitted disease testing, and other preventative services.\n\n\u201cThis would have devastating consequences for women,\u201d she said.\n\nRecently, Planned Parenthood initiated an advertising campaign in support of Clinton. In response, Sanders referred to the endorsement as \"the establishment\" supporting its own.\n\nClinton responded to his accusation.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand what that means,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s been in Congress a lot longer than I have.\u201d\n\nAfter the exchange, Sanders began regularly expressing his support for Planned Parenthood on the campaign trail.\n\nBirth Control\n\nWhile Clinton and Sanders both support the idea of full access to birth control, the Republican candidates have been hostile toward virtually any form of contraception.\n\nEach of the GOP candidates would slash insurance coverage of birth control under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare.\n\nImage Attribution Source: Wikimedia\n\n\n\nCruz, who sponsored a bill to ban a Washington D.C. law that protects women from being fired if they take birth control, has frequently said that the birth control coverage rule included in the ACA forces employers to cover abortion-inducing pills.\n\nTrump has said he would cut insurance coverage of birth control. If he were successful, women would pay an estimated $1.4 billion more a year to cover their birth control, according to the Planned Parenthood Action Fund.\n\nRubio was one of 22 Senators who in 2012 introduced the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which would repeal the contraceptives program in the ACA. It provides 18 types of birth control with \u201cno out-of-pocket costs.\u201d\n\nFamily Leave\n\nThere is still no federal mandate for businesses to provide paid family leave. Nearly 90 percent of Americans in the work force reportedly don\u2019t have viable family leave options at work.\n\nThe United States is one of a handful of nations that doesn\u2019t offer federal paid family leave plan.\n\nBut the issue is getting more attention this year.\n\nWhile Clinton did state two years ago that family leave might not be \u201cpolitically feasible,\u201d during a debate last October she\u2019s changed her stance on the issue.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about time we had paid family leave for American families and join the rest of the world,\u201d she said.\n\nAt the same debate, Sanders, who\u2019s been supportive of family leave and other women\u2019s health issues throughout his life, made it clear he thinks the federal government has a responsibility to provide such a program.\n\n\u201cWhen you look around the world ... you see every other major country saying to moms that, when you have a baby, we're not going to separate you from your newborn baby, because ... we are going to have medical and family paid leave, like every other country on Earth,\u201d he said\n\nWhile Clinton and Sanders now both support 12 weeks of paid leave, the Republican candidates haven\u2019t evolved much on the issue since former House Speaker John Boehner called the Family and Medical Leave Act \u201canother example of yuppie empowerment\u201d in 1993.\n\nWhen asked about family leave while campaigning last summer at the Iowa State Fair, Cruz said he didn\u2019t support a national plan.\n\n\u201cI think maternity leave and paternity leave are wonderful things. I support them personally. But I don\u2019t think the federal government should be in the business of mandating them,\u201d he said.\n\nKasich has said he opposes the federal mandate but supports some alternatives like allowing new mothers to work online from home.\n\nRubio is the only GOP candidate who supports any sort of federal family leave initiative.\n\nLast fall he introduced a plan that would provide a 25 percent non-refundable tax credit for businesses that voluntarily offer at least four weeks of paid family leave, limited to 12 weeks of leave and $4,000 per employee each year.\n\n\u201cExpanding access to paid family leave is part of Marco\u2019s pro-family, pro-growth agenda,\u201d the plan states. \u201cThe status quo too often forces workers \u2014 especially new mothers \u2014 to quit their job permanently when they need time away from it, making it harder to return to work one day.\u201d\n\nBut critics of the plan, including Bryce Covert, the economic policy editor for the liberal group ThinkProgress, say that a tax credit may not be enough to encourage all employers to offer family leave, which would leave the plan helping only employees that are well off.\n\nWhen asked by Fox News about his thoughts on paid family leave, Trump offered few specifics.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something that\u2019s being discussed; I think we have to keep our country very competitive, so you have to be careful of it. But certainly there are a lot of people discussing it.\u201d\n\nA number of recent studies show family leave actually being a positive for the economy.\n\nA study from Rutgers University concluded that new mothers who take paid leave are more likely to be working again nine to 12 months after childbirth, than mothers who don\u2019t take any leave.\n\nA study from the U.S. Census Bureau concluded that new mothers who take paid are more likely to return to the same employer than those who take unpaid leave or no leave.\n\nAnita Raj, PhD, director of University of California San Diego\u2019s Center on Gender Equity and Health and professor in the university\u2019s Division of Global Public Health, said paid family leave is among the most significant women\u2019s health issues on the table in this election.\n\n\u201cLeaving employment to care for a child and being forced to feel constrained or vulnerable to losing your job because you are needed is deeply unfair and can cause great stress\u201d Raj told Healthline. \u201cAnd this disproportionately affects women.\u201d\n\nSexual Assault\n\nThere are a few issues involving women\u2019s health that haven\u2019t received a lot of attention this campaign season.\n\nRaj noted one conspicuously missing from the 2016 campaign trail is sexual assault and, more specifically, the epidemic of college campus rape.\n\n\u201cGiven all the recent attention paid to the issue, from Joe Biden\u2019s efforts to the recent CNN and Oscar-nominated documentary, and the Oscar-nominated song, sung by Lady Gaga, it\u2019s striking that it is not a big issue in this election,\u201d Raj said.\n\nSanders\u2019 plan to make college free, Raj observed, resonates favorably with young voters.\n\n\u201cCollege is in people\u2019s consciousness, and sexual assault on college campuses is the most important women\u2019s health issue that we have not legislatively tackled in this country,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need better prevention efforts.\u201d\n\nRaj said many survivors of sexual assault are dissatisfied with services and are often frustrated with the criminal justice system.\n\n\u201cThese acts compromise their education,\u201d Raj said. \u201cI should not be afraid to send my daughter to college, but I am.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"standout": "http://www.healthline.com/health-news/womens-health-where-presidential-candidates-stand", "news_keywords": "women\u2019s health issues, presidential candidates women\u2019s health issues, Clinton women\u2019s health issues, Trump women\u2019s health issues, Sanders women\u2019s health issues, Cruz women\u2019s health issues, Rubio women\u2019s health issues, Cruz women\u2019s health issues, Kasich women\u2019s health issues, candidates abortion", "og": {"site_name": "Healthline", "description": "Healthline examines where Clinton, Sanders, Trump, Cruz, Rubio and Kasich stand on abortion, Planned Parenthood, birth control, and family leave.", "title": "Women\u2019s Health Issues: Where the 2016 Presidential Candidates Stand", "url": "http://www.healthline.com/health-news/womens-health-where-presidential-candidates-stand", "image": "http://www.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/031416_womenshealthelection_THUMB.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/031416_womenshealthelection_THUMB.jpg", "description": "Healthline examines where Clinton, Sanders, Trump, Cruz, Rubio and Kasich stand on abortion, Planned Parenthood, birth control, and family leave.", "card": "summary", "title": "Women\u2019s Health Issues: Where the 2016 Presidential Candidates Stand"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP", "DC.date.issued": "2016-03-11", "fb": {"app_id": 239371929577489}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Healthline examines where Clinton, Sanders, Trump, Cruz, Rubio and Kasich stand on abortion, Planned Parenthood, birth control, and family leave."}, "article_summary": "\u201cI don\u2019t think, politically, we could get it now.\u201dSo where do each of the presidential candidates really stand on these important women\u2019s health issues?\nI\u2019m going to be good for women\u2019s health issues,\u201d Trump said during his Super Tuesday victory speech two weeks ago.\nWomen\u2019s health has taken center stage in the 2016 presidential election.\n\u201cAnd this disproportionately affects women.\u201dSexual AssaultThere are a few issues involving women\u2019s health that haven\u2019t received a lot of attention this campaign season.\nJohn Kasich, and Florida Sen.
