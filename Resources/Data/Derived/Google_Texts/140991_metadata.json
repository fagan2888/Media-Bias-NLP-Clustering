They only become evident when they are feasting on hapless stars, planets and any other interstellar material that gets sucked into their orbit.\n\nNow, a NASA mission designed specifically to spot supermassive black holes has discovered not one, but 10 of them, behemoths that are gobbling up galaxies billions of light-years away. As with most great discoveries, it happened while the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (nicknamed NuSTAR) was examining something else.\n\n\"We found the black holes serendipitously,\" said David Alexander, a NuSTAR team member based in the Department of Physics at Durham University in England who lead a study published in the Astrophysical Journal in August, in a statement. \"We were looking at known targets and spotted the black holes in the background of the images.\"\n\nThe supermassive black holes are gargantuan versions of garden-variety black holes such as the one at the center of our very own Milky Way galaxy. Among the many things astronomers wish to find out via NuStar is how many black holes of all sizes the universe contains.\n\nThe farthest and by far biggest black hole known to date is 10 billion times the mass of the sun and 10,000 times the mass of the supermassive black hole that resides at the center of the Milky Way, according to the website WorldScience.com and the Royal Astronomical Society. It\u2019s 11 billion years away, WorldScienc.com said. There may be as many as 400 such monsters just in our observable universe.\n\nNuStar, NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion laboratory explained in the statement, is the first-ever telescope capable of focusing the highest-energy X-ray light enough to cut through the dense dust clouds that normally veil these holes, and thus create detailed pictures. The result is a tantalizing glimpse into infinity. Where do black holes lead? Nobody knows.\n\nBelow, an artist's depiction from NASA.", "article_metadata": {"description": "They are distant, massive and as mysterious as they are infinite.NASA discovers 10 supermassive black holes devouring galaxies", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "theresa", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2013/09/14/10-supermassive-black-holes-discovered-inhaling-galactic-souls-151281", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/supermassive_black_holes-nasa.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Appetite For Destruction: 10 Supermassive Black Holes Are Gobbling Up Galaxies"}, "dcterms.date": "2013-09-14T13:00-04:00", "dc": {"title": "Appetite For Destruction: 10 Supermassive Black Holes Are Gobbling Up Galaxies"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2013/09/14/10-supermassive-black-holes-discovered-inhaling-galactic-souls-151281", "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "black holes, NASA, space, astronomy, stars, galaxies, milky way", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 1}, "dcterms.title": "Appetite For Destruction: 10 Supermassive Black Holes Are Gobbling Up Galaxies"}, "article_summary": "The supermassive black holes are gargantuan versions of garden-variety black holes such as the one at the center of our very own Milky Way galaxy.\nNow, a NASA mission designed specifically to spot supermassive black holes has discovered not one, but 10 of them, behemoths that are gobbling up galaxies billions of light-years away.\n\"We were looking at known targets and spotted the black holes in the background of the images.\"\nAmong the many things astronomers wish to find out via NuStar is how many black holes of all sizes the universe contains.\nWhere do black holes lead?"}
