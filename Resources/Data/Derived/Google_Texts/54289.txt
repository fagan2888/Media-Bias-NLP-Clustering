Health Care Rationing: 'Secret' British NHS Trust Policy Won't Send Ambulances to Terminally Ill Patients

Playing God to save a buck.

More than 50 patients have died after an NHS trust introduced a secret policy to downgrade 999 calls and not to send ambulances to terminally ill patients. Managers at East of England ambulance trust were accused of “the most cruel form of rationing imaginable” after admitting that 8,000 patients had been affected by the changes. An internal NHS report discloses that 57 patients died after their calls were downgraded following a decision not to send ambulances to the terminally ill and to those who had given instructions not to resuscitate. It meant that, instead of receiving a response from paramedics in eight minutes, people reporting life-threatening illnesses were given a call back up to 20 minutes later, or had to wait up to an hour for an ambulance.

Welcome to another glimpse into the healthcare future of the United States once Obamacare implodes and the idiot progressives find a way to give us the gift of single-payer. It is a dystopian nightmare that gives bureaucrats with barely functioning intellects the power to decide who lives and dies. Imagine Helen from the DMV in a job where she gets to say, "Your mom doesn't need to hang around for another year or two, we're gonna send this ambulance elsewhere. Oh well." There's your "free" government healthcare future.

Sarah Palin was excoriated for talking about "death panels" in 2008, even though rationing has always been an insidiously integral part of single-payer systems. They have to lie to hide the fact that their policies are so ghoulish, that's why this one was secret.

Single-payer is a monstrosity that will be impossible to undo once it's unleashed, which is why the progressives cannot be allowed to prevail on this issue.
