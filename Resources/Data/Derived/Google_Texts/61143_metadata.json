It was the first time I\u2019d gotten a call from the Haven Coalition since I\u2019d signed up to volunteer. I ran my fingers through my hair as Meredith told me about Pearl: 25 years old, 20 weeks pregnant. She\u2019d arrived in New York City from Buffalo and just finished the first part of a two-day abortion procedure. She would wait for me at the clinic on the Upper West Side.\n\nWhen I arrived at the medical office four hours later, a few women sat scattered throughout the large waiting room. They flipped through magazines, turning pages so quickly I wondered if their eyes absorbed anything. No one spoke. A TV droned. The lavender chairs added a soft touch of color to the otherwise gray space. I told the guard at the security desk that I was from Haven and looking for a woman named Pearl. He rubbed his bald head and pointed to the far corner, where a young girl sat slumped, staring into space. An oversized black sweatshirt hid her protruding belly. She did not look a day over 16.\n\n\u201cHey, I\u2019m Suzanne.\u201d Pearl lifted her head, meeting me with dull brown eyes. Her Greyhound bus had departed at 3 am. It was now 6:30 pm. \u201cI\u2019m here to bring you to my apartment for the night.\u201d Saying that felt strangely sleazy, like I was picking her up at a bar. She nodded, and laboriously lifted herself from the chair. Air hissed from the plastic-coated seat cushion.\n\nOutside, Pearl told me that she lived on a Native American reservation. \u201cDude, I\u2019m the first person in my family to go to college,\u201d she said. \u201cOnce I graduate, everything will be different for me.\u201d She was quiet the rest of the short walk.\n\nI paused a few blocks from my apartment. \u201cWant to stop for something to eat, or order food when we get home?\u201d\n\nShe looked at the ground, her face obscured by long black hair.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s on me,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cCool. Thanks. I haven\u2019t eaten anything all day.\u201d\n\nAfter dinner, she collapsed on the couch. I went to the gym, returned, went to bed. At 5:45 the next morning I found her in the same position. A quick cab ride later, we stood outside the office building that housed the clinic. We nodded at each other and said good-bye. She shifted her bag, then pulled open the glass door. My part was done. Our paths wouldn\u2019t cross again.\n\nI became involved with Haven in 2005, not long before I met Pearl. In the days after George W. Bush\u2019s second inauguration, news analyses foretold the devastating impact another term would have on the already diminished state of reproductive rights. Eventually I stumbled onto an organization that offered grants to help low-income women pay for abortions, which Medicaid hasn\u2019t covered in 35 states since 1976.\n\nI thought I would feel a little bit better about the condition of the country if I could get involved with a group like that. An Internet investigation led me to the Haven Coalition, which connects women forced to travel to New York City for \u201clate-term\u201d abortions \u2013- at 14- to 24-weeks \u2013 with volunteers who provide a meal and a safe place to sleep.\n\nThe accommodations are necessary because second-trimester abortions are two-day, outpatient procedures. On the first day, a type of kelp called laminaria is used to begin cervical dilatation; the next morning the abortion is completed. Fewer than 10 percent of abortions in the United States occur after the first 12 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nIn the rare instances when procedures are performed beyond the first term, reasons vary widely. Some women cannot afford the procedure: By the time they save enough money or find financial assistance, they are in the second trimester. Other women do not completely stop menstruating when they become pregnant, discovering their pregnancies at the end of the first trimester. Some women don\u2019t know where to turn for help. Others find out about severe fetal defects detected by tests administered halfway through the pregnancy. Only two percent of abortions happen after the 21st week.\n\nFor women who are more than 14 weeks pregnant, there\u2019s an extra financial burden, since second-trimester abortions are more expensive. And it\u2019s often challenging to find a doctor to perform a second-trimester abortion, making it more likely that women seeking later procedures will need e to travel greater distances because the number of abortion providers drops dramatically with each additional week\u2019s gestation. Researchers at the Guttmacher Institute found that \u201cwomen obtaining abortions at 16 weeks or later were twice as likely to have traveled 25, 50 or 100 miles or more compared with women seeking first-trimester procedures.\u201d\n\nThere are several places in New York City where a woman can obtain a safe abortion up to 24 weeks into her pregnancy. Many women who find their way to New York barely have enough money to pay for travel and the abortions, let alone a hotel room, which averages around $250 per night. Haven was founded in 2001 by a group of activists who discovered that patients traveling to the city for abortions were spending the night on park benches, in their cars, or at Port Authority Bus Terminal.\n\nIf one of Haven\u2019s partner clinics had a patient who needed a place to stay, the social worker would call the Haven hotline, staffed by a volunteer. The \u201cphoner\u201d gets a patient\u2019s basic information and calls the volunteer signed up to host that night. The host then picks up the patient (and her companion, if there is one) from the clinic, brings her home, provides her with dinner, and escorts her back to the clinic in the morning. Hosting more than once a month is discouraged; hosts can burn out from too many intimate encounters in a short time. That year, about 100 volunteers hosted over 130 women.\n\nAnother call from Haven came in May. Could I accommodate two different patients? Maria was 28 years old and from Peekskill. She spoke only Spanish and was 14 weeks pregnant. Monique hailed from Buffalo. She was 37 years old, 24 weeks pregnant, and already the mother of two. My living room includes two couches. It might be crowded, but we could make it work.\n\nBy the time I arrived at the Murray Hill clinic at 6:30, Maria and Monique were the last two people in the waiting room. They\u2019d been at the clinic all day. After checking in, each woman had waited to speak with a social worker, then waited for gynecological exams. Once the laminaria sticks were in place, there was no turning back, as the seaweed insert began its work of dilating the cervix. Maria, I later discovered, was also given a shot of digoxin. The women lumbered out with me, and the security guard locked the door behind us.\n\nIt was rush hour, but I thought the fastest way to get home would be to take the uptown 6 train, then transfer to a crosstown bus. As we descended into the subway, I gave MetroCards to Maria and Monique and struggled not to lose them in the bustling crowd. It was the first time either had ridden in a subway. The train was packed, but I made a clearing for Maria and Monique. Warm bodies pressed against us on all sides. Maria\u2019s face had a greenish hue.\n\nAs we emerged from underground, Maria grimaced with every step. I scrapped my plan to take the bus and hailed a cab. While we sat in traffic on 79th Street, Maria groaned. Monique and I quietly discussed what could be wrong.\n\nAn hour after we left the clinic, the doorman at my building greeted me, eyeing my guests: two pregnant women of color, one moving with great effort. Whatever he thought, he just nodded when I told him two friends were staying with me for the night.\n\nOnce inside, the ladies each chose a couch. In broken Spanish, I asked Maria if I should call the clinic, which has a nurse on duty overnight, but she shook her head. Perhaps she feared that she\u2019d have to go to the hospital and they might ask about her immigration status. I handed Monique the TV remote, and she flipped through channels while I ordered dinner.\n\nMonique told me about her two kids. Her son was a senior in high school, planning to go to SUNY Buffalo when he graduated. Her daughter was finishing at a community college. \u201cI called a few hotels before I came,\u201d she said. \u201cEach one was $300 or more. That\u2019s more than my mortgage payment!\u201d She laughed. \u201cBut even though I ain\u2019t got no place to stay, I came anyway. My husband and I are done with raising up kids. No way I\u2019m dealing with a teenager when we\u2019re trying to retire.\u201d\n\nDinner arrived. I immediately regretted my choice. Greasy pizza was not a good option for someone in Maria\u2019s condition. She joined Monique and me at the chipped dining room table and choked down a piece anyway. We returned to the living room and watched TV. No one was surprised when Maria leaned over and puked on the hardwood floor. \u201cPerdone, perdone,\u201d she said. She lay back on the couch and closed her eyes.\n\n\u201cNo hay problema,\u201d I replied, using the full extent of my Spanish. I grabbed a roll of paper towels..\n\n\u201cShit, now I\u2019m gonna be sick,\u201d Monique said. She ran to the bathroom.\n\nI called the clinic. The nurse said that the digoxin made Maria nauseated. She suggested a cold compress. It seemed to help only slightly. At midnight, Monique and Maria were still taking turns vomiting in the toilet.\n\nBack in 2005, I thought that it was challenging to access abortion. I joined Haven because the right to choose is meaningless if someone can\u2019t get an abortion when and where she needs one. There are no licensed providers in 87 percent of US counties. State legislators who want to eliminate abortion services pass prohibitive, irrelevant mandates meant to close clinics or drive up the costs until services are almost impossible to provide. In 2011 and 2012, more than 400 abortion restrictions were introduced in state legislatures; over 83 measures passed in 2011 alone, triple the number passed in 2010.\n\nGuttmacher Institute\n\nThis year has also proved to be a watershed for anti-choice legislation, most famously in Texas, when state Senator Wendy Davis bravely filibustered for 13 hours against a bill that would have lead to the closure of 37 of 42 reproductive health care clinics in the state and banned abortions after 20 weeks. She won temporarily, but the measure was ultimately signed into law.\n\nOn top of the scarcity of providers and lack of Medicaid funding, nuances in the language of the Affordable Care Act may cause private insurance plans to drop coverage of abortion services, or force women to pay for separate \u201cabortion riders\u201d. While women with resources will always find a way to safely terminate unwanted pregnancies, poor women suffer disproportionately under this restrictive, hostile environment.\n\nI joined Haven because I am Jewish, and I embrace the tradition of social justice. I wanted to act with ometz, the courage to take risks in pursuing a just cause, and fulfill my obligation of tikkun olam, the call to repair a world rife with inequity.\n\nOne member of Haven, Rabbi David Adelson, dedicated a Rosh Hashanah sermon to Haven\u2019s work. He told his congregation that we are created equally in the image of God \u2014 b\u2019tselem elohim \u2014 and it is our responsibility to ensure that all people are treated equally as well. \u201cRights are rights only if they apply to all,\u201d he said. \u201cOtherwise they are simply privilege. Our Jewish tradition demands that we disperse privilege evenly, and work to defend the rights of every member of society.\u201d These concepts formed my core beliefs. I could not expect others to do what I myself would not.\n\nIn September, I hosted Marianne, 15, and her mother, Soleil. They took the commuter train into the city from Connecticut. Marianne watched the Cartoon Network until she fell asleep on the sofa bed. She didn\u2019t even eat.\n\n\u201cYes, she\u2019s had a long day,\u201d her mother observed as we dined in the next room.\n\nLater Soleil insisted on washing the dishes. As I dried, she told me that she had moved to the United States from Haiti to give her kids a better life. \u201cWithout this abortion, I don\u2019t think that Marianne could graduate high school and go to college,\u201d she said, tears running down her face. \u201cThank you for helping us.\u201d\n\nIt was the least I could do.\n\nIn his book \u201cSpiritual Activism,\u201d Rabbi Avi Weiss wrote, \u201cI was once involved in activism because I enjoyed it, but now I have come to believe that a true activist is one who takes no pleasure from it. Now I\u2019m an activist because I feel I have no choice; there are things I believe I simply must do.\u201d The greatest sin, in fact, is not to act. This was what Haven meant to me.\n\nLaShawna came from Philadelphia with her cousin Sandra. Each had left a toddler in her mother\u2019s care. After dinner, they called home on their cell phones.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t cry,\u201d I overheard each of them say at different points in their conversations. \u201cMommy loves you. I\u2019ll be back tomorrow.\u201d\n\nWe watched TV. During a commercial, I excused myself to use to the bathroom. When I returned, the women were whispering. They stopped when they saw me.\n\nThe situation made me nervous. \u201cWhat?\u201d I asked.\n\nSandra thrust her chin toward my ketubah, the Jewish marriage document that hung on the wall over my couch. It has two columns \u2014 one in Hebrew, one in English \u2014 that outline the egalitarian terms of our marriage, and is decorated with a Florentine flower pattern. \u201cYou Jewish?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, why?\u201d I held my breath.\n\n\u201cI just want to know if all Jews are stingy,\u201d LaShawna said.\n\nHer cousin glared at her. \u201cLaShawna! I told you not to say anything!\u201d\n\nI sighed. Part of me wanted to lash out, to remind them that I paid their way to my apartment, bought them dinner, offered them a place to sleep, and would wake up with them at 5:15 tomorrow morning to take them back to the clinic in a cab that I would also pay for. The other part of me understood the question completely: Over the years, I noticed that some of the worst slumlords in many cities are Jewish; shops that price gouge the most in low-income neighborhoods are too often owned by Jews; and there\u2019s no shortage of stereotyping in the media, with Jews portrayed as money-grubbing misers. I thought about my grandmother. \u201cThere\u2019s good and bad in all people,\u201d she frequently said whenever someone made a nasty remark about some other ethnic group.\n\n\u201cNo, we\u2019re not all stingy,\u201d I replied.\n\nThe women nodded. We went back to watching American Idol.\n\nThe next morning, we crowded into the back seat of a taxi. Halfway to the clinic, LaShawna asked me for $20 to help pay for the garage where they\u2019d parked their car the prior night. Was she manipulating me, taking advantage of my desire not to appear tight-fisted? I pursed my lips and looked out the window. Park Avenue was a ghost town so early in the morning. A few hours later, investment bankers would line up at gourmet shops and buy $14 sandwiches. Our Jewish tradition demands that we disperse privilege evenly. I opened my wallet and handed her the bill.\n\nDuring these days between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, the words of Rabbi Ayelet S. Cohen resonate with me: \u201cMay this season of beginnings be a time of renewal, possibility, and hope.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s been many years since I hosted these women through Haven. I hope that the small role I played in their lives helped them achieve renewal, possibility, and hope.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: Names have been changed throughout this article to protect privacy.\n\nSuzanne Reisman has worked in community development in New York City for 15 years.
