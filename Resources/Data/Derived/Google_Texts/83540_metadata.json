The company will add two new production lines and 50 jobs to the plant. (Photo: GE/Special to the Register )\n\nGE West Burlington plant expansion\n\nCOST: $1.3 million\n\nOWNER: GE\n\nLOCATION: West Burlington, Des Moines County\n\nPROJECTED COMPLETION: End of 2015\n\nJOBS: 50 created; about 230 employees currently\n\nFUNDING: All from GE\n\nDESCRIPTION: The addition of 50 jobs at GE\u2019s West Burlington plant is \u201cbetter than your run-of-the-mill economic development project,\u201d said Jason Hutcheson, president and CEO of the Greater Burlington Partnership.\n\nAbout four years ago, Hutcheson said GE was ready to pull out of the West Burlington location. All production and jobs at the plant were going to be moved elsewhere.\n\nEmployees, the city and the state managed to change GE\u2019s mind, however. Hutcheson said the employees took some cuts, while the city and state provided some incentives to keep GE in the area.\n\nNow, GE is adding two new production lines at the plant. One will produce low-voltage air circuit breakers. The other will make parallel switchgears to control the flow of electricity for specific types of buildings, such as data centers and hospitals.\n\n\u201cYou always hope that if you incentivize the right strategic investments, more will happen down the road,\u201d Hutcheson said. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what happened here.\u201d\n\nIn 2010, the Iowa Economic Development Authority approved $2 million in incentives for GE\u2019s West Burlington location.\n\nABOUT THIS FEATURE: Each Sunday, Development Spotlight will feature new and ongoing projects happening around the state.
