A round-trip ticket will cost between $528 and $630, according to United\u2019s website.\n\nThe new route aims to draw skiers from the Front Range and East Coast alike, said John Urdi, executive director of Mountain Lakes Tourism. It\u2019s a \u201cbucket-list resort,\u201d he said, but one that\u2019s been hard to reach.\n\nIt\u2019s also a fairly conservative expansion for the tourism agency and Mammoth Mountain Ski Resort, which are subsidizing the flight route, Urdi said.\n\nThe 70-passenger, weekly flight is a \u201ctoe in the water\u201d after a ski season marked by late \u2014 and relatively light \u2014 snowfall, Urdi said. The town\u2019s hotel tax fell by nearly a quarter last season, and the season\u2019s snowfall dropped about 23 percent, to 238 inches.\n\nThe tourism agency will spend up to $1.5 million this year to subsidize flights on United and Alaska Airlines, and the resort will pay any costs above that. United said it doesn\u2019t discuss its financial arrangements with resorts.\n\nThe flight adds to United\u2019s seasonal Mammoth Lakes service, which also includes flights from San Francisco. Alaska Airlines will fly there this year from San Diego, Las Vegas and Los Angeles.\n\nThad Moore: 303-954-1902, tsmoore@denverpost.com or twitter.com/thadmoore", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "$1.5M subsidy fuels weekly Denver-to-Mammoth Lakes flights this winter", "title": "$1.5M subsidy fuels weekly Denver-to-Mammoth Lakes flights this winter", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/07/1-5m-subsidy-fuels-weekly-denver-to-mammoth-lakes-flights-this-winter/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-07T13:30:08+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-07T13:30:08+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd361\"", "article_summary": "United Airlineswill fly this winter from Denver to Mammoth Lakes, Calif., home of the nation\u2019s third-most visited ski resort.\nThe flight adds to United\u2019s seasonal Mammoth Lakes service, which also includes flights from San Francisco.\nThe new route aims to draw skiers from the Front Range and East Coast alike, said John Urdi, executive director of Mountain Lakes Tourism.\nThe 70-passenger, weekly flight is a \u201ctoe in the water\u201d after a ski season marked by late \u2014 and relatively light \u2014 snowfall, Urdi said.\nIt\u2019s also a fairly conservative expansion for the tourism agency and Mammoth Mountain Ski Resort, which are subsidizing the flight route, Urdi said."}
