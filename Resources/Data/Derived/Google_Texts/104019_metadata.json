(Photo: ~Courtesy of PSE&G) Story Highlights PSE&G identified a new eagle's nest on the Roseland-Lambertville transmission line right of way\n\nIn 1982, there was one bald eagle nest in New Jersey. Today there are nearly 150 nesting pairs.\n\nThe male and female birds each weighed about 9 pounds.\n\nHigh atop a Public Service Electric & Gas (PSE&G) transmission tower in Somerset County, two bald eaglets are preparing to spread their wings and leave their nest for the first time.\n\nWhen they do, they will sport colored identification bands on their legs thanks to the state's environmental experts and a number of helping hands from PSE&G.\n\nEarlier this year, PSE&G identified a new eagle's nest on the Roseland-Lambertville transmission line right of way. Employees from the utility's Delivery Projects and Construction (DP&C) division and the state's Endangered and Non-game Species Program (ENSP) kept a close eye on the nest, confirming that eaglets had hatched.\n\nTwo eaglets hatched in a nest on a PSE&G transmission tower in Somerset County.

We were only too glad to help.\"\n\nWith instructions on handling the eaglets, four skilled PSE&G towermen climbed the tower and successfully placed the eaglets -- one at a time -- into large cloth duffle bags, where they were gently lowered via ropes and pulleys to three teammates on the ground. ENSP staff and a veterinarian checked out the eaglets, took body and weight measurements, collected a blood sample and banded them.\n\nThe male and female birds each weighed about 9 pounds.\n\nTwo bands were placed on either leg -- a U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service federal identification band and a green New Jersey State band, indicating that the birds were born in the Garden State. These eaglets will take their first flights at about 11\u201312 weeks old at the end of June or early July, but will remain close to the nest until the end of summer or early fall.\n\n\"These eaglets do not yet have their tell-tale white head or tail feathers yet; they won't develop these until they are about 4-5 years old,\" Rocca said. \"As a token of our appreciation, we left a fish in the nest for their next meal.\"\n\nAfter a brief photo opportunity, the eaglets were carefully sent back up the tower and placed back into the nest.\n\n\"We quickly left the area so that the eaglets and their parents could go back to their normal activities,\" Rocca said. \"This was a very special and unique opportunity provided by ENSP wildlife biologists. It is very important to never disturb nesting eagles or their young. People need to keep their distance and avoid making loud noises.\"\n\nAlthough no longer listed as endangered federally, in New Jersey they are still listed as endangered (breeding season) and threatened (non-breeding season). In addition, eagles are still a state and federally protected species under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act.\n\nThrough the management efforts of ENSP and many other groups, bald eagle numbers have soared in New Jersey in recent years. In 1982, there was one bald eagle nest in New Jersey. Today there are nearly 150 nesting pairs.\n\nFor additional information on bald eagles, including NJ's annual eagle reports, please visit the ENSP website: http://njfishandwildlife.com/ensphome.htm\n\nRead or Share this story: http://mycj.co/1M7Oed0", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "The eaglets have landed in Somerset County", "og": {"site_name": "MY CENTRAL JERSEY", "description": "The eaglets have landed in Somerset County", "title": "The eaglets have landed in Somerset County", "url": "http://www.mycentraljersey.com/story/news/local/somerset-county/2015/06/04/pseg-bald-eagles/28467893/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/mycentraljersey.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The eaglets have landed in Somerset County", "title": "The eaglets have landed in Somerset County", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4e06aaba79b63bec3711fedb22a4879f9b3998a2/c=500-0-2500-2000&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/06/04/Bridgewater/B9317604564Z.1_20150604112608_000_GAAB0002T.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@MyCentralJersey", "site": "@MyCentralJersey", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=859380356", "fb": {"app_id": 177893718898560}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0785\"", "article_summary": "Two bald eaglets have been located high atop a PSE&G tower in Somerset County.\nTwo eaglets hatched in a nest on a PSE&G transmission tower in Somerset County.\nHigh atop a Public Service Electric & Gas (PSE&G) transmission tower in Somerset County, two bald eaglets are preparing to spread their wings and leave their nest for the first time.\nIn 1982, there was one bald eagle nest in New Jersey.\nThrough the management efforts of ENSP and many other groups, bald eagle numbers have soared in New Jersey in recent years."}
