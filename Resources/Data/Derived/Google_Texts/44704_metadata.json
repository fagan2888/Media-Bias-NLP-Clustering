Chugging coconut water and kombucha is healthy because, well, it says so on the bottle. But a closer look at trendy health food products shows they are not quite as close to perfection as their marketing suggests.\n\nWhat people put in their mouths is their own business, and there isn\u2019t a right or wrong way to eat. That said: when we stock up on \u201csuperfoods,\u201d we may be telling the world that our commitment to maintaining healthy antioxidant levels makes us hip and healthy, but our shopping habits may be fueled by misconceptions of the health benefits of these foods as well as ignorance of their environmental and social impact.\n\nHere are some trendy health foods that have questionable effects on your body and the world.\n\n1. Coconut water\n\nPeople all over the world have been drinking coconut water since long before American health food stores discovered the naturally hydrating miracle drink and started marketing it as an \u201call-natural Gatorade\u201d and post-yoga beverage. At one time, leading brand VitaCoco\u2019s claim that coconut water had 15 times the electrolytes of a sports drink was one of the selling points that helped fuel a $500 million industry, according to Mother Jones. A 2011 class-action lawsuit forced the popular brand to rewrite some of its overblown claims.\n\nThe industry is also environmentally irresponsible. Much of the coconut water consumed in the U.S. comes from Indonesia and the Philippines, and shipping this drink around the world, releasing carbon emissions in the process, isn\u2019t a sustainable environmental practice. Neither are some coconut farms\u2019 labor practices. Back in 2012, Time reported that coconut farmers are at the bottom of the coconut water supply chain. Coconut farmers reportedly receive only a small portion of the product\u2019s revenues: \u201cMost growers across Asia sell to middlemen, who then resell the coconuts to factories for as much as 50% more\u2026 the increasing demand for coconut water and oil has yet to translate into higher coconut prices due\u2026 to the fact that the young industry is still dominated by a few large companies.\u201d\n\n2. Almond milk\n\nNutritionally speaking, almonds are nearly a perfect food. According to David Jenkins, professor and research chair of nutrition and metabolism at the University of Toronto, almonds carry \u201cidyllic\u201d levels of monounsaturated fats and cardiac benefits due to the nuts\u2019 high concentration of vitamin E, fiber and antioxidant phytochemicals. California\u2019s multi-billion-dollar almond industry is doing quite well. But the demand for almonds, particularly in the form of almond milk, presents several economic and ecological problems.\n\nIt takes over a gallon of water to produce a single almond, and California, the nation\u2019s leading almond producer, is in the midst of its worst drought in recent history. The water-intensive nature of farming almonds and producing almond milk endangers king salmon habitats in northern California\u2019s Klamath River, as NPR\u2019s Alastair Bland reported. According to Bland, if more water is not released into the river soon, the salmon face the danger of gill rot. Unfortunately for the salmon, California doesn\u2019t have water to spare. Almond milk is often used as a substitute for dairy, and it\u2019s not like the dairy industry is a paragon of environmental purity. It seems opting out of milk and milk-like products may be the healthiest option for the earth.\n\n3. Quinoa\n\nQuinoa\u2019s increased popularity in the U.S. hurts indigenous Andean cultures in quinoa-producing countries like Peru and Bolivia. Called a \u201cmiracle grain of the Andes,\u201d quinoa became the complete protein of choice for vegans and many others, \u201ca healthy, right-on, ethical addition to the meat avoider\u2019s larder (no dead animals, just a crop that doesn\u2019t feel pain),\u201d as the Guardian\u2019s Joanna Blythman writes. Consequently, the price of quinoa in Andean countries has gone up, and poorer people who have traditionally depended on the grain as a staple food can no longer afford it. \u201cThe quinoa trade is yet another troubling example of\u2026 well-intentioned health and ethics-led consumers here unwittingly driving poverty there. It\u2019s beginning to look like a cautionary tale of how a focus on exporting premium foods can damage the producer country\u2019s food security,\u201d Blythman concludes.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Some of the hippest health foods make the murkiest claims about their benefits and ethical sourcing", "title": "7 more trendy superfoods that are anything but", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Some of the hippest health foods make the murkiest claims about their benefits and ethical sourcing", "title": "7 more trendy superfoods that are anything but", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/11/22/7_more_trendy_superfoods_that_are_anything_but_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/shutterstock_231453961.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Some of the hippest health foods make the murkiest claims about their benefits and ethical sourcing", "title": "7 more trendy superfoods that are anything but", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/shutterstock_231453961.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Sofia Barrett-Ibarria", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, almond milk, AlterNet, coconut water, kale, Quinoa, superfoods", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccd92\"", "article_summary": "But a closer look at trendy health food products shows they are not quite as close to perfection as their marketing suggests.\nHere are some trendy health foods that have questionable effects on your body and the world.\nBack in 2012, Time reported that coconut farmers are at the bottom of the coconut water supply chain.\nBut the demand for almonds, particularly in the form of almond milk, presents several economic and ecological problems.\nThe water-intensive nature of farming almonds and producing almond milk endangers king salmon habitats in northern California\u2019s Klamath River, as NPR\u2019s Alastair Bland reported."}
