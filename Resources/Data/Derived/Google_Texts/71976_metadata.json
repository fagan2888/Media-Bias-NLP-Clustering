In the time-honored tradition of presumptive nominees, Trump has already laid out a plan for his first 100 days as president, because he is a winner who likes to win, and seems constitutionally (perhaps pathologically) incapable of imagining a future in which he could lose.\n\nIn several interviews with The New York Times, Trump laid out exactly what he hopes to accomplish within the first four months of his presidency. They include the obvious Trump things such as implementing his proposed ban on all Muslims into the U.S., building a gargantuan border wall with Mexico, repealing Obamacare, and getting someone on the Supreme Court, etc.\n\nBut his plans also include several things that only Trump could hope to pull off, like wooing Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell to work with him on legislation, with the Times reporting that they might \u201cschmooze at Mar-a-Lago over golf and two-pound lobsters.\u201d He also plans to give military leaders more power than foreign-policy specialists, turn the Oval Office \u201cinto a high-powered board room,\u201d and, presumably, will continue to call his foreign counterparts things like weak and sad and desperate. (Though he has promised to tweet less.)\n\nIn addition, Trump told the Times he plans on appointing \u201cstrong-willed\u201d outsiders\u2014business leaders and generals\u2014to cabinet positions, and will strong-arm corporate executives into keeping jobs in America or face a 35 percent tariff. \u201cI know everyone won\u2019t like everything I do, but I\u2019m not running to be everyone\u2019s favorite president,\u201d he said.\n\nThankfully, Trump has no desire to undergo any \u201cambitious renovation plans,\u201d meaning that the Washington Monument will not be covered in gold leaf and branded with Trump\u2019s name (though he certainly would like to have another tower in Washington).\n\nPresidential historian Robert Dallek told the Times that Trump would likely be unable to do very much, given precedent and constitutional limitations. \u201cEven in trade and immigration, where Trump says he will make revolutionary changes, Congress has a say on those things. A lot of people have a say. The president is not king.\u201d At least, not yet.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u201cI know everyone won\u2019t like everything I do, but I\u2019m not running to be everyone\u2019s favorite president.\u201d", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9Net 2016", "author": "Tina Nguyen", "og": {"site_name": "Vanity Fair", "description": "\u201cI know everyone won\u2019t like everything I do, but I\u2019m not running to be everyone\u2019s favorite president.\u201d", "title": "The Trumpiest Things That Trump Would Do in His First 100 Days", "url": "http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/05/donald-trump-president-100-days", "image": "http://media.vanityfair.com/photos/572a6c3f493a996a3de7178a/4:3/w_1200,h_630,c_limit/donald-trump-presidency.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.vanityfair.com", "description": "\u201cI know everyone won\u2019t like everything I do, but I\u2019m not running to be everyone\u2019s favorite president.\u201d", "title": "The Trumpiest Things That Trump Would Do in His First 100 Days", "image": {"src": "http://media.vanityfair.com/photos/572a6c3f493a996a3de7178a/master/pass/donald-trump-presidency.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@VanityFair", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"admins": 7802537, "app_id": 1591153417872059, "pages": 8810407571}, "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "keywords": "donald trump,2016 presidential election,republican national convention", "pubdate": "2016-05-04T06:26:00Z", "viewport": "user-scalable=no, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "In several interviews with The New York Times, Trump laid out exactly what he hopes to accomplish within the first four months of his presidency.\nThey include the obvious Trump things such as implementing his proposed ban on all Muslims into the U.S., building a gargantuan border wall with Mexico, repealing Obamacare, and getting someone on the Supreme Court, etc.\n\u201cEven in trade and immigration, where Trump says he will make revolutionary changes, Congress has a say on those things.\nPresidential historian Robert Dallek told the Times that Trump would likely be unable to do very much, given precedent and constitutional limitations.\nIn addition, Trump told the Times he plans on appointing \u201cstrong-willed\u201d outsiders\u2014business leaders and generals\u2014to cabinet positions, and will strong-arm corporate executives into keeping jobs in America or face a 35 percent tariff."}
