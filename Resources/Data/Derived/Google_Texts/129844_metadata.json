On paper, the influence-peddling business is drying up. But lobbying money is flooding Washington, DC like never before. What\u2019s going on?\u201d by Lee Fang: \u201cIn January, \u2026 for a third straight year, overall spending on lobbying decreased. Lobbyists \u2026 continue to deregister. In 2013, \u2026 registered lobbyists dipped to 12,281, the lowest number \u2026 since 2002. But \u2026 lobbying isn\u2019t dying; instead, it\u2019s simply going underground. \u2026 A loophole-ridden law, poor enforcement, the development of increasingly sophisticated strategies that enlist third-party validators and create faux-grassroots campaigns, along with an Obama administration executive order that gave many in the profession a disincentive to register\u2014all of these forces have combined to produce a near-total collapse of the system that was designed to keep tabs on federal lobbying.\n\n\u201cWhile the official figure puts the annual spending on lobbying at $3.2 billion in 2013, [American University\u2019s James] Thurber estimates that the industry brings in more than $9 billion a year. \u2026 Lee Drutman, a lobbying expert at the Sunlight Foundation, says that at least twice as much is spent on lobbying as is officially reported. Trade association documents, bankruptcy filings and reports from political consulting firms \u2026 show that many of America\u2019s largest corporations have spent much more on lobbying than they\u2019ve officially disclosed. In some cases, the quarterly registration system, used by the public and journalists, shows only one-tenth of the amount that firms spend to win favorable treatment by the federal government. \u2026\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cThe new captains of the influence-peddling industry lobby openly and with no interest in registration, reaping huge financial rewards. \u2026 [T]he American League of Lobbyists \u2026 changed its name in November to the Association of Government Relations Professionals. And while lobbyists must report their payments from clients, those ducking the system quietly bring in the biggest paydays.\u201d http://goo.gl/z0X8R0\n\nSEN.

Over the next few months, conservatives shook off Rubio\u2019s charm offensive and whipped themselves into a familiar frenzy against his immigration-reform plan. \u2026 The cumulative humiliations have transformed the former party savior into a figure himself in need of saving. \u2026 Conservatives liked the sound of Rubio\u2019s immigration plan, but it could not survive legislative contact with the enemy. Compromising on immigration means handing a legislative accomplishment to Obama, a taboo that dwarfs any ideological commitments.\u201d http://goo.gl/hHqctm\n\nA KEY LIFE LESSON FOR YOUR KIDS \u2013 Ruth \u201cThe Truth\u201d Marcus, in Sunday\u2019s WashPost, \u201cWhat\u2019sApp: An updated American success story\u201d: \u201cBoth co-founders applied unsuccessfully for jobs at the company that just agreed to make them billionaires. \u2018We\u2019re part of the Facebook reject club,\u2019 [Brian] Acton told Forbes.

This is still a government which imprisons dissidents, is hostile to gay rights, sponsors and supports a vicious regime in Syria -- and that's just a partial list.\u2019 While the games' may burnish Putin's reputation in some eyes, \u2018no amount of Olympic glory can mask these realities.\u2019\u201d http://goo.gl/ecmELS\n\nCHASER \u2013 WashPost Style section lead, \u201cGreat views but not the full picture: Controversies have dogged Olympics\u2019 host nation, but NBC\u2019s coverage has largely pushed them to the margins,\u201d by Paul Farhi: \u201cBefore [Costas\u2019 comments], the most hard-nosed analysis that NBC has offered may have come the night before the Opening Ceremonies. In a conversation with Costas, New Yorker \u2026 editor David Remnick, hired as an analyst by NBC, opined that the Games represented an opportunity for Putin to \u2018reassert Russia on the world\u2019s stage. \u2026 Remember, he\u2019s an autocrat; he\u2019s no democrat. He has no interest in LGBT issues or human rights, all the things that are being discussed. And he doesn\u2019t care that you care that much.\u2019 \u2026 [T]he absence of further discussion about the anti-gay law has disappointed gay rights advocates. \u2026\n\n\u201cIn an interview, Remnick, the author of \u2018Lenin\u2019s Tomb,\u2019 a Pulitzer Prize-winning account of the fall of the Soviet Union, declined to assess NBC\u2019s Olympic coverage. But he noted that American TV in general has shown waning interest in international news. \u2018Whether it\u2019s Russia or China, they need to spend more resources to tell those stories,\u2019 he said. \u2018That\u2019s a much bigger point than whether it made it into [prime time during] the Olympics.\u2019 When it has focused on Russia during the Games, NBC has tended to put a happy face on the host nation. The primary vehicle has been a series of \u2018travelogue\u2019 pieces highlighting regional and historical aspects of Russia, each hosted by correspondent Mary Carillo.\u201d http://goo.gl/kntAex\n\n--REMNICK GOT RAVES \u2026 N.Y.

C.W. \u2018Bill\u2019] Young's term has attracted outside groups on the left and the right even though evidence is spotty at best that \u2026 special elections can predict which party will win [fall fights] \u2026 Early voting by mail points to a close race. \u2026\n\n\u201cThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the [National] Republican Congressional Committee and Jolly have invoked Obamacare in television commercials. \u2026 In one of his \u2026 ads, Jolly says, \u2018I'm fighting to repeal Obamacare right away.\u2019 Private polling in both parties says that while the health care law is unpopular, outright repeal is trumped by a rebuttal like Sink's -- that parts must be fixed, but simply eliminating it would empower the insurance industry.\u201d http://goo.gl/pHqxbo\n\nTHE PRESIDENT\u2019S WEEK AHEAD, per the White House: \u201cOn Saturday, the President has no public events scheduled.

Perhaps most astonishing is that lawyers are themselves some of the biggest beneficiaries of the settlement\u2019s misinterpretations.\n\nOn top of the claims that they have made for themselves, many lawyers are taking up to 25% of their clients\u2019 awards in fees. And with nearly $5 billion awarded to claimants thus far, law firms could stand to collect more than $1 billion in additional fees.\n\nThe settlement wasn\u2019t intended to be a huge payday for lawyers who did not suffer any spill-related losses or may have even profited from representing claimants. It was designed to help people and businesses that suffered real financial losses due to the spill.
