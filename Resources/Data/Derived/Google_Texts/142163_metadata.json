enrollment for Covered California, there\u2019s still concern people aren\u2019t aware health insurance will soon be required.\n\nWith the countdown on, the group is hoping its ready for their call centers to open on Oct. 1 for the beginning of California\u2019s implementation of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cWe are learning every single day,\u201d Covered California spokeswoman Lizelda Lopez said.\n\nHundreds of call center agents still need to be trained to answer the broad range of questions people across the state will have.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t buy a car on the first visit,\u201d Health Access Executive Director Anthony Wright.\n\nThe group says it isn\u2019t expecting a lot of calls in October, because even with all of the TV ads and outreach, most Californians have no clue they\u2019re required to have health insurance on Jan. 1.\n\nPeople don\u2019t know about this new option,\u201d said Wright. \u201cThey won\u2019t be able to use it.\u201d\n\nThe group is bracing for some growing pains and hoping to learn from the inevitable mistakes.\n\nReports showing call volume, enrollment numbers and demographics will come in weekly showing who isn\u2019t signing up and who may need the most help.\n\n\u201cFor every day we don\u2019t get people enrolled, that\u2019s money in Washington, D.C., that\u2019s not coming into our healthcare system,\u201d Wright said.\n\nAgents have been told they may have to work long hours to make sure they\u2019re able to answer callers\u2019 questions.\n\nOne of the big concerns of Covered California is making sure they have at least one person who speaks the language needed for calls they receive.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The group says it isn\u2019t expecting a lot of calls in October, because
