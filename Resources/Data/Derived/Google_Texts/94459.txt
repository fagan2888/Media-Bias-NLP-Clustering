The Republican National Committee today released a video today highlighting the problems news organizations faced while trying to sign onto the Obamacare site – HealthCare.gov.

The accompanying release said:

This week Democrats shut down the federal government, refusing to give Americans reprieve from the trainwreck that is Obamacare. The Republican National Committee (RNC) is highlighting the President’s rosy Rose Garden speech versus the reality that is error messages, “please wait” signs and elevator hold music. See the new video, “Error 404.”

“Democrats shut down the government amid disastrous headlines and with a majority of the country opposing Obamacare,” said RNC Chairman Reince Priebus. “Obama knows he’s selling a lemon and giving big business a break from Obamacare, why not the rest of America?”
