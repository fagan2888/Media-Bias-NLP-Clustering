A report in April from the office of John Sopko, the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR), said DOD could only account for $21 billion of the total $66 billion it spent to date rebuilding the war-torn country.\n\nRelated: $45 Billion in Tax Dollars Goes Missing in Afghanistan\n\nIn the latest spending travesty, SIGAR on Thursday released an inquiry into the U.S. Agency for International Development\u2019s misbegotten support for Afghanistan\u2019s education sector, totaling about $769 million.\n\nAccording to the report, the new Afghan Minister of Education and the Minister of Higher Education recently told the Afghan legislature that \u201cformer ministry officials who served under President Hamid Karzai provided false data to the government and to international donors regarding the number of active schools in Afghanistan.\u201d\n\nIt seems as if there are no active schools in insecure parts of the war-torn country and that \u201cformer officials doctored statistics, embezzled money, and interfered with university entrance exams,\u201d according to SIGAR. \u201cThese allegations suggest that the U.S. and other donors may have paid for schools that students do not attend and for the salaries of teachers who do not teach.\u201d\n\nRelated: Is State Dept. Trying to Muzzle Afghanistan Watchdog?\n\nUSAID has frequently touted its education programs as being among its most successful in Afghanistan. For instance, USAID has cited a sharp increase in student enrollment in schools, from an estimated 900,000 in 2002 to more than eight million in 2013 as an indication of progress. It now appears that these figures were falsified by the Afghan Ministry of Education.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "It must have come as a great relief to U.S.", "title": "Karzai\u2019s Education Ministers Fleeced the U.S. of Roughly $769 M", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/06/18/Karzai-s-Education-Ministers-Fleeced-US-Roughly-769-M", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/Karzai.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/06/18/Karzai-s-Education-Ministers-Fleeced-US-Roughly-769-M", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/Karzai.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "It must have come as a great relief to U.S.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb44e\"", "article_summary": "It now appears that these figures were falsified by the Afghan Ministry of Education.\nUSAID has frequently touted its education programs as being among its most successful in Afghanistan.\nRelated: $45 Billion in Tax Dollars Goes Missing in AfghanistanIn the latest spending travesty, SIGAR on Thursday released an inquiry into the U.S. Agency for International Development\u2019s misbegotten support for Afghanistan\u2019s education sector, totaling about $769 million.\nIt must have come as a great relief to U.S. military and State Department officials when former Afghanistan president Hamid Karzai told The New York Times that he was done with politics and won\u2019t attempt to win back his old job.\nCorruption and theft was rampant throughout almost a decade of Karzai rule during the U.S. occupation of Afghanistan, and it was compounded by the Defense Department\u2019s incompetence in auditing the expenditure of billions of dollars."}
