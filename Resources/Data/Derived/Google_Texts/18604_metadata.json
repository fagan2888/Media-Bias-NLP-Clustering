No less than 10 characters are imprisoned in some way, shape, or form within the episode\u2019s hour and that doesn\u2019t even take into consideration the metaphorical chains worn by the vast majority of the universe\u2019s inhabitants. So what, precisely, has everyone in the greater Westeros region feeling so bound up?\n\nAs Freudian as it may sound, their parents.\n\nEven when not directly involved in an individual\u2019s life, parents cast a long shadow in any universe centered on a system that includes so much in the way of lines of succession, family crests, and, well, incest. Time and again throughout \u201cThe Gift,\u201d we see individuals forced to a point where they must choose to abide by the standards set by their parents or make their own path. It\u2019s not something that\u2019s gone unexamined by the show before, (a theme perhaps best explored in this piece that suggests the only way for the remaining Stark children to survive the series is to stop being Starks) but \u201cThe Gift\u201d showed a renewed commitment to the question, with father figures passing on and actual fathers forced to choose whether or not to sacrifice their children for their own glory.\n\nThe episode begins at the Wall, with Jon taking off with the wildlings to meet up with more of their brethren and leaving Castle Black under the rule of First Ranger Thorne. Jon\u2019s choice to become Lord Commander of the Night\u2019s watch and eschew the opportunity to become a Stark both bears out his father\u2019s wishes by abiding by his oath to the Night\u2019s Watch, the honorable thing to do, particularly by Ned Stark standards, while also cutting himself off fully from the family he knew as his own. Meanwhile, Sam loses his father figure in Maester Aemon and is almost immediately forced to defend Gilly from lecherous members of the Watch. In the aftermath, Sam breaks his vow of celibacy as he and Gilly consummate their relationship.\n\nIn less pleasant consummations, Sansa is imprisoned in a tower in Winterfell, spending her days weeping and her nights being raped, leaving her so desperate that she begs Theon to help her, by placing a candle in the broken tower to signal the North of her distress. She appeals to him, not as Reek, the broken down toy of a sadist, but as Theon Greyjoy, the last surviving son of Balon Greyjoy. Theon, being a useless sack of shit, takes her faith in him and craps it all out on Ramsay\u2019s floor, giving him both Sansa\u2019s candle as well as her intentions with regards to her escape. In retribution, Ramsay flays the nice old woman from last episode and lets his wife admire his handiwork. On the bright side, Sansa returns from their ambulation with a handheld weapon she manages to secret into her skirts, so maybe she can do everyone a favor and bury it in someone\u2019s brain before the season ends. The most curious factor of Sansa\u2019s storyline, a repurposed plot that in the books involved a character named Jeyne Pool posing as Arya Stark and being married off to Ramsay, is the idea that it\u2019s the Stark name and the fate that befalls Sansa that would drive the North to rise up and protect her. She is being punished because her name has value, her father\u2019s honor had value, and that value can still be exploited.\n\n(In case you were hoping for Brienne to sweep in and rescue Sansa, we briefly see the former standing watch outside of Winterfell staring intently at the broken tower, willing a candle to appear and anxiously awaiting episode nine, which I assume is around the time Brienne will actually be allowed to do something again.)\n\nStannis is another character who\u2019s having trouble getting anything going, as his troops seem to be faltering under what would be considered Massachusetts\u2019 mildest winter ever, which leads Davos to suggest they give up and return to Castle Black. However, winter in Westeros lasts for years, as Stannis reminds Davos, and this is as good a chance as they\u2019ll ever have to take Winterfell. Davos slinks off with his tail between his legs and Melisandre suggests that they could probably move things along if Stannis would just let her sacrifice his daughter to the Lord of Light (which, honestly, feels like Melisandre\u2019s solution for everything). But Stannis, as evidenced in the last few episodes, is a loyal father to Shireen and rebuffs the Red Woman, sending her away and leaving him alone with his thoughts and contemplating the fight to come.\n\nBut, as likely comes as no surprise given the recent loss of their patriarch, no family struggles as mightily in the shadow of their father as the Lannister clan. In Dorne, Jaime fruitlessly tries to persuade Myrcella to return home with him, advising her that it\u2019s her mother\u2019s will. But Myrcella is young and in love and has no qualms about refusing her \u201cUncle Jaime\u2019s\u201d wishes. As far as she\u2019s concerned, her mother traded her like chattel to Dorne and now that she\u2019s happy, wants her to abandon her happiness and return to King\u2019s Landing, merely because she bids it. In this moment, Jaime yearns for the authority that a father has over his child, that Tywin never shied away from using with his own children, but serving merely as Uncle and messenger, he has no such sway over Myrcella, a realization that leaves him wanting.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In an hour that considers the subtle (and not-so-subtle) bondage of family, an unexpected encounter steals the show", "title": "\u201cGame of Thrones\u201d recap: Two legendary characters finally come face to face", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "In an hour that considers the subtle (and not-so-subtle) bondage of family, an unexpected encounter steals the show", "title": "\u201cGame of Thrones\u201d recap: Two legendary characters finally come face to face", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/25/game_of_thrones_recap_two_legendary_characters_finally_come_face_to_face/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/game_of_thrones23.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In an hour that considers the subtle (and not-so-subtle) bondage of family, an unexpected encounter steals the show", "title": "\u201cGame of Thrones\u201d recap: Two legendary characters finally come face to face", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/game_of_thrones23.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Libby Hill", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Game of Thrones, game of thrones recap", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8f85\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Game of Thrones, game of thrones recap, Entertainment News, NewsIn case it was lost on anyone after watching \u201cThe Gift,\u201d \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d would like to reiterate that often times, people feel imprisoned within their lives (and lies.)\nShe is being punished because her name has value, her father\u2019s honor had value, and that value can still be exploited.\nIn Dorne, Jaime fruitlessly tries to persuade Myrcella to return home with him, advising her that it\u2019s her mother\u2019s will.\nMeanwhile, Sam loses his father figure in Maester Aemon and is almost immediately forced to defend Gilly from lecherous members of the Watch.\nBut Myrcella is young and in love and has no qualms about refusing her \u201cUncle Jaime\u2019s\u201d wishes."}
