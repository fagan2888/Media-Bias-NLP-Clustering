These changes are intended to manage health care costs and improve plans\u2019 value. Once they are put into place, employers anticipate cost increases in 2016 to be around 4% (for the second consecutive year), the smallest increase in 15 years but more than twice the Consumer Price Index.The survey also found that 70% of employers said the two-year delay in the implementation of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s excise tax on high-value health plans will have a small or negligible impact on their health care strategies for 2017.\u201cEmployers are motivated primarily by the desire to manage cost growth and improve the value of the plans they deliver,\u201d says Randall Abbott, senior health and benefit strategist at Willis Towers Watson. \u201cAs they consider a wide range of options, they are implementing changes that not only lower the rate of cost increases but also achieve better health outcomes and improve the patient experience.\u201dEmployers are adopting many new options including telemedicine, onsite health centers and technology to improve employee engagement.
