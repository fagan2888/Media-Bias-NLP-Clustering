Mark Begich (D-AK), one of the four Red State Democrats seeking reelection in the 2014 mid-term election. The endorsement is a rare instance of a conservative group backing the same candidate as the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC).\n\n\u201cDan Sullivan is a fiscal conservative with a stellar track record in Alaska and we strongly endorse him for the United States Senate,\u201d Club for Growth President Chris Chocola said in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cDan has fought for pro-growth tax reform, taken on ObamaCare in court, and beaten back federal overreach by Obama\u2019s EPA.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the Senate,\u201d he continued, \u201cDan Sullivan will continue the fight for economic freedom and we can\u2019t wait to see him help deliver for America the kinds of pro-growth policies he\u2019s already delivered for Alaska.\u201d\n\nSullivan, a former Alaska Attorney General and state Department of Natural Resources commissioner, is one of five candidates seeking the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate and is considered the favorite in the August 19 primary.\n\nThe most recent poll out of Alaska found Sullivan was the most competitive Republican against Begich, though he trailed by 4 points, just outside the margin of error. A separate poll paid for by American Crossroads, a Republican super PAC, showed Sullivan leading the Democratic senator by 6 points.\n\nChocola slammed Begich, calling him a \u201cdisaster\u201d and a reliable voter for President Barack Obama and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV).\n\n\u201cLiberal Democrat Senator Mark Begich has been a disaster in the United States Senate,\u201d said Chocola. \u201cHe votes for the Obama agenda nearly every chance he gets, from ObamaCare to Obama\u2019s failed stimulus, and he works with Harry Reid to stymie pro-growth policies from passing the Senate.\u201d\n\nWhile the Club for Growth place heavy emphasis on the need to replace Begich, Chocola said that the \u201cnext Republican Senate Majority must consist of the right kind of Republicans,\u201d pointing a solid fiscal conservatives already in the chamber, including Sens. Tim Scott (R-SC), Mike Lee (R-UT), and Rand Paul (R-KY).\n\n\u201cChris McDaniel, Ben Sasse, Tom Cotton, and now Dan Sullivan in Alaska are the next generation of candidates needed to ensure not only a Republican Senate majority, but also a fiscally conservative majority within that majority,\u201d he added.\n\nBegich has, like other vulnerable Democrats, tried to distance himself from President Obama and his party, recently telling CNN: \u201dI don\u2019t need [Obama] campaigning for me \u2014 I need him to change some of his policies.\u201d In 2013, Begich voted with his party 93% of the time.\n\nDefeating Begich is a necessity if Republicans hope to take control of the Senate in this year\u2019s election. The seat is currently rated \u201cToss-up/Tilt Democrat\u201d by The Rothenberg Political Report.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Barack Obama,Chris Chocola,Club for Growth,Club for Growth PAC,Dan Sullivan,Economy,fiscal conservatives,Harry Reid,Mark Begich,ObamaCare,Senate Election 2014,Stimulus", "description": "Dan Sullivan The Club for Growth PAC has endorsed Dan Sullivan in his bid to unseat Sen.
