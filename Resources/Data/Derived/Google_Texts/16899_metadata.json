And it is; the startup is actually in Alberta, Canada.\n\nVitality Air produces and sells \u201chand-bottled\u201d air from Banff and Lake Louise, two Canadian locales known for their Rocky Mountain surroundings and crystal clear bodies of water.\n\nMore from The Daily Dot: \u201cMall Santa helps with special moment for grieving family\u201d\n\nThe startup has been capturing that air in \u201cmassive cans\u201d through a clean compression process, which according to Vitality Air, \u201clock[s] in the pure air without any contamination.\u201d The siphoned air is taken back to the company\u2019s bottling facility, where \u201cwe begin filling our convenient delivery cans to the brim with excellent air.\u201d\n\nVitality Air\u2019s pitch might read like a throwaway joke on Silicon Valley, but the company has found a market for their version of Canada Dry. People in smog-filled Chinese cities have been buying up the cans in bulk.\n\nMore from The Daily Dot: \u201cTwitter gets real about mental health with #WhenIThinkOfMentallIllness\u201d\n\nAfter shipping 500 sample bottles to China, Vitality Air suddenly found itself with an unmatched demand for its product. Currently, the company has a shipment of 4,000 set to make its way to the country, with over 1,000 of them already pre-sold.\n\nA study of air quality in China earlier this year produced less than encouraging results; United States-based non-profit organization Berkley Earth found that over 80 percent of Chinese people are exposed to pollution that exceed safe levels set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. It also found that air pollution was responsible for 4,000 deaths each day in the country, accounting for 17 percent of all deaths.
