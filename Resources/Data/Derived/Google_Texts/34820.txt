LAFCADIO, THE LION WHO SHOT BACK

Published in 1963, this was Shel Silverstein's first children's book. A 50th anniversary edition was released in 2013. The fable goes like this: A lion eats a hunter in Africa, taking his gun and becoming a crack shot himself. A circus man names him Lafcadio the Great and brings him to New York City, where he grows more humanlike, dressing in starched collars and fancy suits. Soon, he grows despondent and returns to the jungle to ponder whether he's more man or beast. Anniversary edition, HarperCollins.
