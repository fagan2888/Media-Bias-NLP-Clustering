Hsia, M.D., of the University of California San Francisco, analyzed records of California ED visits between 2005 and 2011. They found the overall \"visit rate\" fell 0.7 percent during this period, while visits increased 13.4 percent for non-injury diagnoses, with visit rate growth particularly high for nervous system disorders, symptoms of abdominal pain and gastrointestinal system diseases, according to the study.\n\n\"While many people think of the ED as simply a place to go when you have a car accident or some type of major trauma, it is increasingly the case that the emergency department is caring for complex medical patients,\" Hsia wrote in a statement. \"At the same time, as our population ages, we are seeing a significant rise in older patients with falls or other trauma. The emergency department therefore plays a critical role in our healthcare system's ability to care for the acutely injured as well as complex disease.\"\n\nED visits for injuries grew at a slower pace than non-injury diagnoses for Medicaid patients and patients with private insurance, but the rate fell among the uninsured, according the study. Meanwhile, Medicare patients saw similar growth for injury and non-injury diagnoses. Injury-related diagnoses were more common in patients 45 and older, whereas patients between the ages of 5 and 44 had more non-injury related diagnoses, and significant growth in the rate of patients using the ED to address mental health conditions, according to the study.\n\nThe findings, Hsia wrote, reflect \"both changes in the population disease burden and the ED's more central role in healthcare compared to its original charge to treat injured patients and provide charity care.\" Prior research indicated healthcare reform, at both the state and federal levels, also led to increased ED use.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here's the study abstract\n\n- read the announcement\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nER use continues to rise in wake of Affordable Care Act\n\nMajority of frequent ER users have chronic conditions, not mental illness\n\nEmergency department visits increase since ACA implementation\n\nMaryland hospitals focus on lingering psych patients to ease ED crowding\n\nED use up since MA instituted healthcare reform\n\nWill healthcare reform drive up ED use?\n\nAdmissions traffic from ED, outpatient clinics on the rise", "article_metadata": {"description": "The rate of patients in California who visit the emergency department for non-injury conditions has increased, indicating a shift in the ED's role in healthcare,\u00a0according to\u00a0a study published in\u00a0Health Affairs.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "The rate of patients in California who visit the emergency department for non-injury conditions has increased, indicating a shift in the ED's role in healthcare,\u00a0according to\u00a0a study published in\u00a0Health Affairs.", "title": "More patients use ER to treat complex, chronic conditions", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/more-patients-use-er-treat-complex-chronic-conditions/2015-04-07", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "California,Care Delivery,Chronic Conditions,ED use,emergency department,mental health,Operations & Business Management", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Operations & Business Management"}, "article_summary": "Researchers led by Renee Y.
