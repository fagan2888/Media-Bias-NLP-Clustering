An empty apartment complex in Oklahoma City erupted in fire Saturday for a second time.

Firefighters were called to the Lantana Apartments just after 4:30 a.m.

The fire was extinguished.

Officials said they were called to the same complex one day earlier, and after the recent fires, part of a building has collapsed.

No injuries were reported.
