In the press, this was happening: \u201cJohn Kasich has a Jon Huntsman Problem,\u201d \u201cJohn Kasich and the Huntsman Trap,\u201d \u201cJohn Kasich Risks Becoming the New Jon Huntsman,\u201d \u201cJohn Kasich Enters Race. Is He 2016\u2019s Jon Huntsman?\u201d And just for variety's sake: \u201cJohn Kasich: A Jeb Bush in Jon Huntsman Clothing.\u201d\n\nThat's right: every political reporter on the planet had EXACTLY THE SAME hot take. The basis of this scorching analysis is that Kasich's chief strategist, John Weaver, was also Jon Huntsman, Jr.'s chief strategist in the 2012 GOP primary\u2014and that didn't end well for Huntsman. He came in 7th place in the Iowa caucuses before finishing third in New Hampshire primary and dropping out of the race. Judging by this tweet from his daughter Abby, bad feelings linger:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/HuntsmanAbby/status/623516084352761857\n\n\u201cEvery campaign is different, every race is different\u2014that\u2019s pack journalism at its most glib and lazy.\u201d John Weaver\n\nI thought it would be interesting to know what Weaver thinks of the Official Beltway Consensus that his new candidate is a doomed-to-fail carbon copy of his old one. Perhaps not surprisingly, Weaver doesn't buy it and takes a jaundiced view of pundits pushing this line.\n\n\u201cEvery campaign is different, every race is different\u2014that\u2019s pack journalism at its most glib and lazy,\u201d he told me, after I rattled off some headlines. \u201cGovernor Kasish is a conservative\u2019s conservative. His conservative record, for many of these reporters who don\u2019t seem to want to do any research, dates back to Congress when he took on welfare reform, led the effort to balance the budget, was a defense hawk, helped reform the Pentagon, balanced budget in Ohio, cut taxes.\u201d\n\nThere are, I pointed out, some outward similarities between the two men. Both served as governor. Neither fits the mold of a standard-issue Republican presidential candidate. Both derive satisfaction from acts of conservative apostasy: Huntsman believes in evolution and compared the Republican Party to communist China, Kasich expanded Medicaid coverage under the Affordable Care Act and doesn't give a rat's ass if some people don't like it.\n\nIn the discussion that ensued, Weaver listed a number of differences that I'll group into four categories:\n\nPersonal background\n\nJon Huntsman, Jr., is the wealthy scion of a Utah family whose patriarch, Jon Huntsman, Sr., got ridiculously rich by inventing those styrofoam clamshell containers your Big Mac used to come in at McDonald's before the world awakened to environmentalism. Kasich's roots are much more modest. \u201cHis background [is] in a rough-and-tumble town outside Pittsburgh.\u201d His father was a mailman.\n\nTemperament\n\nBoth Huntsman, Jr. and Kasich style themselves \u201ctruth-tellers\u201d who won't be intimidated. Huntsman's problem, though, is that he was intimidated. Asked at a Fox News debate if he'd reject a budget deal that skewed 10-to-1 in favor of budgets cuts over tax increases\u2014in other words, a fantastic deal for Republicans\u2014Huntsman lost his nerve and raised his hand along with every other candidate on stage, a move he now regrets:\n\nStipulating that \u201cthis is just about Governor Kasich, not anybody else,\u201d Weaver essentially vowed that Kasich won't back down in that situation: \u201cWhat I\u2019m saying is there\u2019s not a stage that\u2019s too big for Governor Kasich, and there\u2019s not a moment that\u2019s going to be too big for him, either.\u201d\n\nTies to Obama\n\nBefore he ran for the GOP nomination in 2012, Huntsman was President Obama's ambassador to China. \u201cHe had worked for the president,\u201d says Weaver. \u201cThat\u2019s a huge difference.\u201d It tainted Huntsman in the eyes of many conservatives right from the beginning. Kasich hasn't worked for Obama. Expanding Medicaid under Obamacare could cause him problems, although Weaver disagrees. \u201cThat\u2019s just a difference of opinion,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s not Barack Obama\u2019s money. That money belongs to the taxpayers of Ohio. And the fact that Governor Kasich brought that money back to Ohio, expanded Medicaid and held the rate of growth from 9 percent to 4 percent\u2014better than anywhere else in the country\u2014is a sign of leadership.\u201d\n\nMoney\n\nJon Hunstsman, Sr., wasn't willing to let his entire styrofoam-clamshell-fortune ride on his son's presidential bid. In 2012, Weaver says, \u201cHuntsman had not one TV ad, no piece of direct mail, no paid phone calls\u2014no money.\u201d By contrast, Kasich is already up on TV in New Hampshire, has two 527 committees that have reportedly raised more than $11 million, and has an established network of donors that should keep the money flowing.\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misstated the day Kasich announced his campaign.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Joshua Green", "description": "John Weaver makes the case that the two presidential candidates are different in important ways.", "parsely-section": "politics", "og": {"site_name": "Bloomberg.com/politics", "description": "John Weaver makes the case that the two presidential candidates are different in important ways.", "title": "John Kasich's Strategist Thinks Those Kasich-Is-the-New-Huntsman Stories Suck", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-07-23/john-kasich-s-strategist-thinks-those-kasich-is-the-new-huntsman-stories-suck", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iJ959Dvy2rfA/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"description": "John Weaver makes the case that the two presidential candidates are different in important ways.", "title": "John Kasich's Strategist Thinks Those Kasich-Is-the-New-Huntsman Stories Suck", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-07-23/john-kasich-s-strategist-thinks-those-kasich-is-the-new-huntsman-stories-suck", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iJ959Dvy2rfA/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "site": "@bpolitics", "card": "summary"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"status": "John Weaver makes the case that the two presidential candidates are different in important ways."}, "parsely-title": "John Kasich's Strategist Thinks Those Kasich-Is-the-New-Huntsman Stories Suck", "parsely-tags": "Comparisons,Region: Global,Page: article", "parsely-post-id": "NRXNPR6JTSEF01", "parsely-author": "Joshua Green", "date": "2015-07-23T09:01:03.825Z", "keywords": "Comparisons", "parsely-type": "post", "news_keywords": "Comparisons", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-07-23T09:01:03.825Z", "parsely-image-url": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iJ959Dvy2rfA/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-07-23/john-kasich-s-strategist-thinks-those-kasich-is-the-new-huntsman-stories-suck"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc9fd\"", "article_summary": "In the press, this was happening: \u201cJohn Kasich has a Jon Huntsman Problem,\u201d \u201cJohn Kasich and the Huntsman Trap,\u201d \u201cJohn Kasich Risks Becoming the New Jon Huntsman,\u201d \u201cJohn Kasich Enters Race.\nThe basis of this scorching analysis is that Kasich's chief strategist, John Weaver, was also Jon Huntsman, Jr.'s chief strategist in the 2012 GOP primary\u2014and that didn't end well for Huntsman.\nOn Tuesday, Ohio Governor John Kasich became the 16th candidate to join the GOP presidential field.\nIs He 2016\u2019s Jon Huntsman?\u201d And just for variety's sake: \u201cJohn Kasich: A Jeb Bush in Jon Huntsman Clothing.\u201dThat's right: every political reporter on the planet had EXACTLY THE SAME hot take.\nHe came in 7th place in the Iowa caucuses before finishing third in New Hampshire primary and dropping out of the race."}
