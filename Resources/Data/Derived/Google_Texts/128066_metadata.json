Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., a leading opponent of President Obama\u2019s move to provide amnesty for up to 5 million illegal immigrants, expressed astonishment Monday and ridiculed the administration for not carrying out the action through an executive order.\n\nIn remarks made at the Washington office of the government-watchdog group Judicial Watch, Sessions said: \u201cI guess they just whispered in the ear of (DHS Director) Jeh Johnson over at Homeland Security, \u2018Just put out a memo. That way we don\u2019t have to enforce the law.'\u201d\n\nThe news that Obama had not signed an executive order to carry out the policy he announced to the nation in a televised address Nov. 20 was broken by WND Senior Staff Writer Jerome Corsi last week.\n\nAs a result of the president\u2019s use of a memo instead of an official order, the senator observed: \u201cWe don\u2019t even have a really significant, direct, legal direction that we can ascertain, precisely what the president is doing. It\u2019s a stunning event in my view.\u201d\n\nLike the reporting you see here?

As the senator read excerpts of Obama\u2019s own words, members of the audience laughed aloud at how much those words differed from the president\u2019s actions.\n\nThe president should simply uphold the Constitution as it is, Sessions said, \u201cnot as he wishes it would be.\u201d\n\nSessions, who was a U.S. attorney for 12 years and Alabama attorney general for two years, said it was clear the Constitution gives Congress powers over naturalization law.\n\nHe called Obama\u2019s amnesty a scheme Congress had explicitly rejected after multiple efforts.\n\n\u201cThe House said no, and the American people said no. Congress said no, and the president has gone forward.\u201d\n\nDespite that, Sessions observed, powerful forces wanted amnesty.\n\n\u201cI mean, the president wanted that, Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y, wanted that, some Republicans wanted that, business groups wanted that, La Raza wanted that, ACLU, all these people wanted it,\u201d he said.\n\nBut the American people did not, said the senator, which is why Congress had decided to limit the number of people who can enter the country to live and work.\n\nThe senator dropped a bombshell last week when he revealed he had learned the Obama administration is opening a facility in Crystal City, Virginia, to implement the president\u2019s amnesty plan.\n\nSessions discovered the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, or USCIS, is hiring 1,000 full-time and permanent staff members to quickly approve illegal immigrants\u2019 applications for amnesty.\n\nSessions also learned the administration will provide work permits, photo IDs, Social Security and Medicare to illegal immigrants.\n\nHe noted that all of those benefits for illegal immigrants had been rejected by Congress.\n\nThe Obama administration had initially indicated illegal immigrants would not be eligible for Social Security benefits, but officials were forced to admit the plans after Sessions revealed them.\n\nOn Monday, Sessions repeated his call to House leaders to add language into the pending omnibus spending bill blocking funds for executive amnesty. House leaders have resisted the effort by GOP conservatives.\n\nHe said the most effective tool is public opinion, and he asked voters to make clear to their elected representatives how much they oppose amnesty.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a challenge, but I think the American people get it. I think they are going to insist their voice will be heard,\u201d predicted Sessions.\n\nSessions said it was known that government officials held some 20 meetings with business stakeholders hoping for amnesty, adding, \u201cYou know who\u2019s not a stakeholder? You. John Q. Public.\u201d\n\nSessions was introduced by Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton, whose organization has broken numerous big developments in administration scandals involving the IRS, Benghazi, Obamacare and Fast and Furious gunrunning, as well as immigration.\n\nJust last week, Judicial Watch Director of Investigations Chris Farrell told WND a government assertion that no terrorists had crossed the southern border into the country was \u201csimply false\u201d and provided details to the contrary.\n\nIn his introduction, Fitton noted the public doesn\u2019t want amnesty, \u201cbut leaders of both parties do.\u201d\n\nHe reminded listeners how Judicial Watch had published \u201cstory after story\u201d exposing the Obama amnesty agenda and its inherent dangers.\n\nMost pointedly, Fitton observed that amnesty was not about illegal aliens, it was about the illegal alien vote, and \u201cthe illegal alien vote is about stealing elections.\u201d\n\nHe referred to a study he said showed that enough illegals voted in 2012 to give Obama a margin of victory in his re-election campaign. Illegals also provided enough votes to elect the 60th Democrat senator needed to pass Obamacare in the face of GOP opposition.\n\nFollow Garth Kant @DCgarth", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Sen.
