The Broncos’ opening drive of the third quarter ended with a thud. Literally. On 4th-and-9 at Miami’s 15-yard line, Brandon McManus lined up for a seemingly routine 33-yard field goal.

But McManus hit the right upright, his third missed field goal on the season for Denver. The kick would have brought the Broncos within one (21-20), but instead the Dolphins got another opportunity to extend their lead, and they capitalized. Quarterback Ryan Tannehill found Jarvis Landry for a five-yard touchdown catch on the Dolphins’ subsequent drive, putting them up by 11.

The missed field goal by McManus inevitably revived comparisons to Matt Prater, who was released by the Broncos in October following his four-game suspension and who has since signed with the Lions.



McManus came at a cheaper price tag, but Prater led the NFL last season by converting 25-of-26 field goals for a .962 success rate — including a 64-yard kick that broke a 43-year-old record. He is 9-of-12 for Detroit through Sunday.
