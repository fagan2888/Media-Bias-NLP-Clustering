It\u2019s one facing thousands of Californians who are required to purchase health insurance through Affordable Care Act exchanges. As if rising premiums \u2013 which increased across California this year \u2013 weren\u2019t already hard enough, skyrocketing deductibles have rendered many plans \u201call but useless,\u201d according to a recent report in the New York Times.\n\nAnd, as a new analysis from my organization shows, it\u2019s only getting worse.\n\nWhile premiums are what it costs to have insurance, deductibles are what it costs to use it. Especially for low- and middle-income families, these out-of-pocket costs are placing affordable health care further out of reach.\n\nMy organization recently completed an analysis of deductibles across the country, including in California. Relying on data from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the federal agency overseeing the Affordable Care Act, we calculated weighted average deductibles by enrollment across gold, silver and bronze plans.\n\nHere\u2019s the short version: It\u2019s not good.\n\nAll three categories increased by an average of $362, or 14.5 percent, in California this year. Silver plans \u2013 whichm with 862,000 enrollees, are the most popular in the state \u2013 now have deductibles averaging $2,245, while bronze plan deductibles average $5,323.\n\nIn other words, the 1.2 million Californians with silver and bronze plans will pay $2,245 to $5,323 before their health insurance coverage kicks in.\n\nThat\u2019s not an option for many families. A December survey by Bankrate.com found only 37 percent of Americans have the savings to pay for an unexpected expense of even $1,000. Others said they\u2019d add it to credit cards, borrow from family or friends or slash spending from other areas of their budgets.\n\nWhat\u2019s more is insurance premiums are increasing at the same time. A similar analysis by my organization found premiums for individual exchange plans increased across the Golden State this year. So not only is it more expensive to purchase insurance, but it\u2019s also more expensive to use it.\n\nAnd there\u2019s the real rub of health insurance under the Affordable Care Act. Consumers have increasingly fewer options and control over how they spend their health care dollars. Instead, they\u2019re forced to purchase insurance policies from government exchanges whose premiums they cannot afford, and whose deductibles limit their use.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that higher deductibles by themselves are not bad. Some Californians may actually prefer high-deductible plans as a way to lower their premiums upfront, or to assume more responsibility for their costs as they need it. But as we\u2019re seeing, the Affordable Care Act is denying consumers those choices \u2013 and forcing them to pay higher costs all the way around.\n\nWhile some may instinctively blame insurance companies for these rising costs \u2013 after all, they\u2019re the ones mailing the bills \u2013 they\u2019re losing money, too. UnitedHealth, one of the nation\u2019s largest insurers, announced losses of nearly $1 billion in 2015 and 2016 on the exchanges. The outlook is so bad that they and other insurers are even considering leaving the exchanges altogether next year, which may result in millions of canceled plans.\n\nRather, these higher costs are the result of a one-size-fits-all federal health care law that treats every patient as if they were the same. First it was millions of canceled plans. Then it was \u2013 and still is \u2013 higher premiums. Now it\u2019s sky-high deductibles making health insurance too expensive to use.\n\nIt\u2019s always something else with the Affordable Care Act. Unfortunately for Californians, it\u2019s higher costs and fewer choices.\n\nNathan Nascimento is director of state initiatives at Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce.", "article_metadata": {"geo.region": "US-CA", "content_section": "commentary", "description": "Opinion: Health insurance deductibles going up | insurance, deductibles, health, plans, costs, care, premiums, affordable, act, use", "geo.position": "33.745573;-117.867834", "author": "NATHAN NASCIMENTO", "og": {"site_name": "The Orange County Register", "description": "What good is health insurance coverage if you can\u2019t afford to actually use it?", "title": "Health insurance deductibles going up", "url": "http://www.ocregister.com/articles/insurance-708494-deductibles-health.html", "image": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/ocregister/gallery/o45l72-b88665916z.120160316152828000ggvf6jj1.10.jpg", "locale": "en-US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/ocregister/gallery/o45l72-b88665916z.120160316152828000ggvf6jj1.10.jpg"}, "title": "Health insurance deductibles going up", "description": "What good is health insurance coverage if you can\u2019t afford to actually use it?", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@ocregister"}, "publication_date": "2016-03-16", "content_author": "NATHAN NASCIMENTO", "fb": {"app_id": 107698536003308}, "content_thumbnail": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/ocregister/thumb/o45l72-b88665916z.120160316152828000ggvf6jj1.10.jpg", "content_type": "article", "ICBM": "33.745573, -117.867834", "Keywords": "insurance, deductibles, health, plans, costs, care, premiums, affordable, act, use", "geo.placename": "Santa Ana", "access-type": "paid", "section": "commentary", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "content_title": "Health insurance deductibles going up"}, "article_summary": "It\u2019s one facing thousands of Californians who are required to purchase health insurance through Affordable Care Act exchanges.\nNow it\u2019s sky-high deductibles making health insurance too expensive to use.\nWhat good is health insurance coverage if you can\u2019t afford to actually use it?\nAnd there\u2019s the real rub of health insurance under the Affordable Care Act.\nWhile premiums are what it costs to have insurance, deductibles are what it costs to use it."}
