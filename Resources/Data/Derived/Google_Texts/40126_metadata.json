He wore a neck brace due to his neck and back injuries.\n\nHernandez said he was working in a trench when he heard a loud noise. Then the ground buckled from under him.\n\n\u201cIt was like a bomb,\u201d he said, in Spanish, of the noise.\n\nAfter the group plummeted to the ground, Hernandez\u2019 close friend, Jose Luis Rosales-Nava, 42, a father of three, was trapped under a board.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t responding.\n\n\u201cHold on, hold on,\u201d he remembered telling his friend.\n\nRosales was later pronounced dead.\n\nThe bridge's 140-foot center span collapsed as a crew from Central Concrete of North Carolina poured the concrete deck, officials said. The bridge will connect a library under construction along Perry Creek Road with nearby classroom buildings.\n\nParamedics arrived at the campus within six minutes of the collapse, but officials said getting to the injured took time due to the construction in the area and the wooded terrain the bridge traversed.\n\nA second bridge under construction on campus, which will connect a parking deck along Success Way with classroom buildings, collapsed Friday morning. No injuries were reported in that incident.\n\nThe two bridges, which have a similar design, are part of a campus expansion project on the Louisburg Road campus paid for by bonds approved by voters in 2012.\n\n\n\nOfficials with Skanska USA, the general contractor for both bridges, have not said what caused either collapse. Determining a cause, and any safety violations, could take months, state Department of Labor officials said.\n\nTwo workers remained in the hospital Sunday while Hernandez and another man have been released.\n\nFor Hernandez, who has worked in construction for 30 years, continues to have difficulty sleeping.\n\n\n\nHe thinks about how things could\u2019ve been much worse.\n\n\u201cSomething could have happened to the kids,\u201d he said, referring to Wake Tech students.\n\nHe has also forgiven those who may have caused the accident.\n\n\u201cIt doesn't do me any good to judge them,\u201d he said. \u201cI have to forgive them because what is done is done. I just want them to make changes so that it doesn't happen again.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30;polling-uri=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=1;polling-uri2=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=2;polling-uri3=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=3;polling-uri4=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=4;polling-uri5=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=5;cycle=1", "dcterms.created": "2014-11-16 18:38:00", "description": "One of the four workers injured in a deadly bridge collapse at Wake Technical Community College's Northern Campus on Thursday spoke about the incident on Sunday.", "application-name": "WRAL.com", "dcterms.modified": "2014-11-16 18:47:55", "outbrain": {"ob_desc": "id_asset=14187839|asset_type=story"}, "twitter": {"description": "One of the four workers injured in a deadly bridge collapse at Wake Technical Community College's Northern Campus on Thursday spoke about the incident on Sunday.", "title": "Wake Tech bridge worker: \"It was like a bomb\" :: WRAL.com", "url": "http://www.wral.com/wake-tech-bridge-worker-it-was-like-a-bomb-/14187839/", "image": "http://wwwcache.wral.com/asset/news/local/2014/11/16/14187841/14187841-1416180999-160x120.jpg", "site": "@wral", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#041E30", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "robots": "index,follow", "pinterest": "nohover", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/favicons/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/favicons/mstile-310x150.png", "fb": {"app_id": 334167666672300}, "author": "WRAL", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-16T18:38:00-05:00"}, "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/favicons/mstile-150x150.png", "og": {"site_name": "WRAL.com", "description": "One of the four workers injured in a deadly bridge collapse at Wake Technical Community College's Northern Campus on Thursday spoke about the incident on Sunday.", "title": "Wake Tech bridge worker: \"It was like a bomb\" :: WRAL.com", "url": "http://www.wral.com/wake-tech-bridge-worker-it-was-like-a-bomb-/14187839/", "image": "http://wwwcache.wral.com/asset/news/local/2014/11/16/14187841/153642-14394-20141116181009-6p-frame-1-960x540.jpg", "type": "article"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msapplication-TileImage": "/favicons/mstile-144x144.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdafd9\"", "article_summary": "After the group plummeted to the ground, Hernandez\u2019 close friend, Jose Luis Rosales-Nava, 42, a father of three, was trapped under a board.\nHernandez, 43, was working on a pedestrian bridge at Wake Technical Community College\u2019s Northern Campus on Thursday when it collapsed, sending him and four others to the ground.\nA second bridge under construction on campus, which will connect a parking deck along Success Way with classroom buildings, collapsed Friday morning.\n\u201cSomething could have happened to the kids,\u201d he said, referring to Wake Tech students.\nThe bridge will connect a library under construction along Perry Creek Road with nearby classroom buildings."}
