The Lehigh Valley Burn Center says Jennifer's in critical condition.\n\nMayor Tom Acri says, \"We see fires, this is the first time we've seen a burn victim. I have seen them over my time, being in the borough, but this is the first time for quite a few years.\"\n\nNeighbor Jackie Dietrich found Jennifer outside of her home, laying in the kiddie pool, motionless. She says, \"I kept asking people, is she dead, is she dead? If she was I could cry my eyes out.\"\n\nJennifer's boyfriend wasn't at home when the fire started. The American Red Cross is helping out.
