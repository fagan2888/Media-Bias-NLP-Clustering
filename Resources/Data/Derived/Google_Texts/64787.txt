QuikTrip Corp. is moving forward with plans to transform a former Dillons grocery store into a gas station.

The Tulsa, Okla.-based convenience has green-lighted a construction project to build one of its “Gen-3” stores near Lincoln and Hydraulic, a site that is across the street from an existing QuikTrip.

The former Dillons building, which QuikTrip purchased in 2011, will be razed to make room for the new QuikTrip. However, actual construction on the new QuikTrip isn’t expected to start until the first quarter of next year, says QT spokesman Mike Thornbrugh.

Once construction starts, he says, stores typically take 25 weeks to complete.

This is the latest in a recent string of upgrades for QuikTrip.

The company has been updating existing stores and outfitting them with an in-house food-service concept, called QT Kitchens. Those give customers opportunities to purchase made-to-order food and drinks.

QuikTrip is also adding new stores across the Wichita area, some of which are to replace existing stores, while others are in areas that have not had a QuikTrip before.

Sites near Highway K-96 and Ridge Road and K-96 and Oliver are under construction and are among the brand new stores QuikTrip has planned for the Wichita area.

QuikTrip also recently added a replacement store at 37th Street North and Rock Road and has another planned for 47th Street South and Hydraulic.

QuikTrip won’t disclose publicly the extent of its capital improvement plan in Wichita, but it’s clear the plan is extensive.

“When we are finished, Wichita is going to be like a brand new division for us,” Thornbrugh says. “There’s a lot of capital and a lot of effort.”
