Of course not. Then why would you ever vote for Joe Dorman?\"\n\nThe ad continues saying, \"Dorman supports expanding Obamacare.\"\n\nThat's true. Dorman says his first act as governor would be to expand Medicaid as part of the Affordable Care Act. He agrees with those who say it would cover more than 100,000 uninsured Oklahomans and have a positive impact on the economy.\n\nFallin rejected the expansion claiming the federal help would be temporary and the state would ultimately have to foot the bill for the increased cost.\n\n\"Dorman, a critic of commonsense conservative solutions, called cutting income taxes \u2018a waste of time,'\u201d the ad says.\n\nThat's technically true - at least the part about calling income tax cuts \"a waste of time.\"\n\nThe quote is from last year when Dorman told a Chickasha newspaper that debating a bill to lower Oklahoma's income tax was \"a waste of time.\" He believed the bill was written incorrectly and would be found unconstitutional.\n\nDorman did vote several times against changing the income tax rate and has said the cut does not give most people enough extra money to fill up their gas tank.\n\n\n\n10/2/2014 Related Story: Truth Test: Do Oklahoma Governor Candidate Joe Dorman's Ads Pass Or Fail?\n\nThe ad continues with some more tax criticism, \"Dorman even supported raising taxes on Oklahoma businesses.\"\n\nYou decide on this one.\n\nThe Fallin campaign points to Dorman being against a law reducing the tax on some oil and gas wells from seven to two percent. Opponents said the tax cut would cost the state hundreds of millions in revenue.\n\nDorman's website claims Oklahoma has had policies sugar-coated as tax cuts, but are actually tax giveaways to those who don't need a tax break.\n\nWe caught up with Fallin on the campaign trail in Coweta to ask about the ad. She admits some negative ads put out false information, but that it's fair to contrast the differences.\n\n\"We've tried to be very accurate in my ads, talking about his positions. He's been against a lot of policies I've put into place,\u201d she said.\n\nOur Truth Test continues Tuesday with the latest ads from the Dorman campaign.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "Voters go to the polls in little more than a week, and as election day approaches, the governor's race is heating up with the negative ads flying between Fallin and Dorman.", "og": {"url": "http://www.newson6.com/story/27053476/governor-fallins-latest-ad-gets-put-to-the-truth-test", "image": "http://KOTV.images.worldnow.com/images/5412981_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Voters go to the polls in little more than a week, and as election day approaches, the governor's race is heating up with the negative ads flying between Fallin and Dorman.", "title": "Governor Fallin's Latest Ad Gets Put To The Truth Test"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KOTV.images.worldnow.com/images/5412981_G.jpg", "description": "Voters go to the polls in little more than a week, and as election day approaches, the governor's race is heating up with the negative ads flying between Fallin and Dorman.", "card": "summary", "title": "Governor Fallin's Latest Ad Gets Put To The Truth Test"}, "wnreadableurl": "governor-fallins-latest-ad-gets-put-to-the-truth-test", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "owner": "KOTV", "fb": {"app_id": 497059410331845}, "date": "2014/10/27", "KEYWORDS": "tulsa,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,kotv.com,channel 6,channel six,green country,television,the news on 6,the news on six,six in the morning,live", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS16", "verify-v1": "67+ifqPKEX7ZTB2sopjxTD1c6nx6ScxupNN92EqnIpc=", "news_keywords": "tulsa,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,kotv.com,channel 6,channel six,green country,television,the news on 6,the news on six,six in the morning,live"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0258\"", "article_summary": "We took a look at the latest ad from the Fallin campaign and put it to the Truth Test.\nOur Truth Test continues Tuesday with the latest ads from the Dorman campaign.\nThat's technically true - at least the part about calling income tax cuts \"a waste of time.\"\n\"Dorman, a critic of commonsense conservative solutions, called cutting income taxes \u2018a waste of time,\u2019\u201d the ad says.\n10/2/2014 Related Story: Truth Test: Do Oklahoma Governor Candidate Joe Dorman's Ads Pass Or Fail?"}
