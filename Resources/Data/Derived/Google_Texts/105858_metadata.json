The Legislature should consider the decrease in crime when debating whether to accept the plan.\n\nHealthy Utah Plan acceptance is a public safety issue\n\nOver the last year, there has been a fight in Utah between Governor Gary Herbert and some Republican legislators about whether or not to accept the Healthy Utah Plan to help provide medical insurance and care for all Utahns under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe Utah Health Care Task Force Legislative Committee recently voted to not accept the governor's proposal. They voted to consider a much lower level of medical insurance expansion that would cost Utah around one half of what the governor's plan would cost.\n\nThe argument against accepting Federal Healthy Utah funds seems to be due to a concern that Utah will be obligated to pay a portion of the constantly increasing Healthy Utah cost. Although Utah will receive 100 percent reimbursement of Healthy Utah funding for the next few years, after that, Utah will have to start picking up some of the cost. Utah's budget could significantly increase if Healthy Utah costs continue to increase.\n\nBut that assumes that Utah will do nothing after accepting the funds and will not be able to do a good job managing the program. The same legislators that don't want the governor to accept Healthy Utah funds also believe that Utah can do a better job managing Utah lands. If they really believed that, they should want to accept Healthy Utah funding in order to show the federal government and other states how Utah can do a great job managing the money.\n\nAccepting Healthy Utah funds doesn't just help those who need the safety net. It decreases diseases that can spread quickly through society. Fighting disease is a legitimate government job. It will also significantly increase public safety and save local governments millions. Money could be saved in the care of jailed inmates. Some studies say that over 50 percent of inmates in county jails could benefit from health care, which includes mental health care and substance abuse treatment.\n\nAt present, about 20 percent of Salt Lake County Jail inmates have medical insurance. If Utah accepts Healthy Utah funding, the percentage of covered inmates could approach 100 percent. That funding would allow for treatment of inmates while incarcerated (transported to facilities as in-patients) and have the treatment continue upon release. Instead of almost ignoring the main problem that causes much of the crime in Utah\u2014drugs\u2014substance abuse treatment could be funded. Instead of letting inmates out without treatment due to jail capacity limits, they could be treated immediately. Washington reduced recidivism 21-33 percent when they expanded medical care to include treatment for chemical dependency of arrested individuals, according to Michael DuBose, CEO of Community Oriented Correctional Health Services.\n\nMental health treatment would also be more thorough and effective. That would decrease drug use and crime caused by drug addiction and mental health issues. The public would directly benefit from the subsequent decrease in crime.\n\nUtah counties would benefit due to the significant reduction in costs that counties have to provide basic medical care, mental health treatment and substance abuse treatment. Salt Lake County believes it could save millions. Salt Lake County District Attorney Sim Gill voiced his opinion at a June 10 County Council hearing.\n\n\"The Healthy Utah plan will have a direct impact on recidivism rates and the costs of providing continuity of care,\" he said. \"This will have a huge impact on the criminal justice system.\u201d\n\nThis could be the first step to actually solving the crime problem caused by recidivism involving mental health issues. State prison inmates would also receive medical care after release from prison. Because of limits private insurers put on medical treatment when illegal activity, such as drug use, is involved, the Legislature should also require that drug abuse treatment be part of medical insurance.\n\nSuccessful criminal justice implementation would require that medical insurance plans include drug abuse and mental health treatment involving illegal activity.\n\nThe governor showed he can be trusted to put Utah's interests first when it comes to dealing with the federal government. Herbert convinced the federal government during the shutdown to allow Utah to take over operations of national parks in the state.\n\nA potential 21-33 percent decrease in crime should be an important reason to accept the governor's Healthy Utah Plan. An interesting side effect would come if the decrease in crime is big enough to not have to move or upgrade the Utah State Prison.\n\nGeorge Chapman is a former Naval Officer and retired engineer who is active in Salt Lake City issues.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"app": {"url": {"ipad": "itms://itunes.apple.com/us/app/deseret-news/id425758986?mt=8&uo=4", "iphone": "itms://itunes.apple.com/us/app/deseret-news/id425758986?mt=8&uo=4", "googleplay": "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.deseretnews.android"}, "name": {"ipad": "Deseret News", "iphone": "Deseret News", "googleplay": "Deseret News"}, "id": {"ipad": 425758986, "iphone": 425758986, "googleplay": "com.deseretnews.android"}}, "description": "Accepting the governor's Healthy Utah plan will help public safety.
