Tighter restrictions on young drivers haven\u2019t helped either.\n\nThe introduction of driverless cars, which some industry experts say will be on roads within the next decade, promises to further reduce the share of Americans who feel the need to get a driver\u2019s license.\n\nThe result of fewer licensed driver is that the aggregate number of miles driven has plateaued over the past decade, according to research from the Brookings Institute.\n\nThat may be bad news for automakers and the gasoline industry, but it\u2019s good news for drivers themselves.
