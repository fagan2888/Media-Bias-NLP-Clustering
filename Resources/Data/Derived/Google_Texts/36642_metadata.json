The new parents taught little Alma all the colors of the rainbow and beyond, in the way most parents teach most kids those colors: they pointed to objects\u2014an apple, a grape, a stretch of bright grass\u2014and told their daughter the color of those objects. Red, purple, green.\n\nThe pair made one omission in this prismatic approach to their daughter's education, though: Deutscher and his wife didn't tell Alma the color of the sky. They wanted to see what would happen to a developing mind when that mind had not been informed about one of the oldest truisms we have: that the sky is blue.\n\nOne day, as father and daughter were taking a walk, Deutscher pointed to the sky and asked his daughter what color it was.\n\nAs Radiolab tells it: Alma was confused. To her, it seemed, the sky was not a thing; therefore, it could have no color. A little more time went by. The pair went for a walk. Deutscher asked again. This time, Alma answered that the sky is white. A little more time went by. It wasn't until much later that, when asked of the color of the sky, Alma responded with the answer most of us would consider to be obvious.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The origins of quantitative meteorology", "author": "Megan Garber", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "The origins of quantitative meteorology", "title": "Is the Sky Actually Blue?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2014/05/cyanometer/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/05/this-is-how-people-once-measured-the-blueness-of-the-sky/370821/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc1b8\"", "article_summary": "One day, as father and daughter were taking a walk, Deutscher pointed to the sky and asked his daughter what color it was.\nIt wasn't until much later that, when asked of the color of the sky, Alma responded with the answer most of us would consider to be obvious.\nDeutscher asked again.\nThe pair made one omission in this prismatic approach to their daughter's education, though: Deutscher and his wife didn't tell Alma the color of the sky.\nTo her, it seemed, the sky was not a thing; therefore, it could have no color."}
