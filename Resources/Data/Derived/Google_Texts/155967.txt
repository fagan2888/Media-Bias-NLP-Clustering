The photo, from 2012, shows a pileup of claims at the Department of Veterans Affairs facility in Roanoke, Virginia. In the second year of Obama's presidency, many folders stuffed with claims had piled up. The files were moved, but the national pileup of disability compensation claims has continued. The backlog of claims languishing in the VA system has now increased to more than 630,000, and heads are about to roll--especially Secretary Eric Shinseki's.
