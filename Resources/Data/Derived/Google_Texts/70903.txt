Many state governments and businesses are already taking action to avoid having to buy health insurance for more people, under the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare).

Beginning in 2015, larger employers will have to provide health coverage for employees working 30 or more hours a week.

As a result, school systems, state and county governments and private businesses across the country are already cutting back on workers’ hours.

In Indiana, many school districts are reducing the hours of teachers’ aids, bus drivers and coaches to avoid having to spend more on healthcare.
