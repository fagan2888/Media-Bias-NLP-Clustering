By eliminating the expense of group coverage, employers pass along the savings to employees in the form of extra pay, which helps lower the cost of individual insurance. For employees, the extra pay represents an increase in taxable income which, when combined with government subsidies, often enables qualified employees to pay even less than they would have paid under a group health plan. Add to that the freedom for employees to choose plans that fit their needs and budgets, and it\u2019s clear to see why many small business employers have opted for this solution.\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, the healthcare landscape is still shifting in the US; it\u2019s more important than ever for small business owners to understand the issues they face heading into open enrollment, which runs November 1 through January 31:\n\nGrandfathered Group Plans Expiring\n\nWhen the Affordable Care Act took effect, several states allowed for small business group health plans to be grandfathered in. Under these plans, small businesses were not required to provide minimum essential benefits. Over the next several years, beginning with California and Colorado on January 1, 2016, these grandfathered programs will expire and small businesses will be faced with the challenge of navigating the Affordable Care Act for the first time. They\u2019ll receive a letter from their insurance carrier and will notice disproportionally high rate increases for new group plans that comply with requirements under the Affordable Care Act. Now\u2019s the time for them to step back, evaluate all employee insurance options and crunch the numbers to see what works best for their business.\n\nIncreased Premiums\n\nGroup insurance premiums are on the rise and getting more expensive every year. Individual insurance plans are also seeing increases, but the numbers are hard to deny: the average group insurance premium is around $16,000 per year for a family. By contrast, on the individual market, the average premium is just under $1,000 per year ($82 per month) after subsidies. For small business owners looking to get off the treadmill of their group insurance plan, migrating to the individual market this open enrollment period is just the ticket.\n\nKing v. Burwell Ruling\n\nJune\u2019s King v. Burwell court decision makes that transition even more appealing for small business owners: the Supreme Court ruled that qualified individuals \u2013those supporting a family of four on $95,000 or less \u2013 in all states are eligible for federal healthcare subsidies, meaning more employees have the opportunity to get affordable coverage. The facts: 87 percent of the people who selected marketplace plans for 2015 qualified for financial assistance, and 70 percent of the average consumer\u2019s healthcare is being covered by subsidies. Encourage employees to work with a licensed insurance agent to determine subsidy eligibility and review available healthcare plans to help them save money.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nWithin this constantly changing landscape, even more companies will get creative with their health coverage offerings for 2016. Going outside the traditional group market can be significantly more affordable for employees, and provides them with greater choice of coverage for their unique circumstances and regardless of prior health history.\n\nRelated Article: Your Employees Are Scared To Take Vacation. Fix That!\n\nThe benefits are clear for small business owners, too \u2013 especially those with expiring grandfathered group plans, navigating the Affordable Care Act for the first time. Group insurance is getting more expensive, and employers are often paying more for coverage than on rent. Migrating to individual plans eliminates the guesswork for businesses, and allowing employees to purchase individual coverage helps moderate business expenses, making them more predictable and manageable.\n\nAn insured workforce is a healthier workforce, which translates fewer days out of office and higher productivity \u2013 something we can all agree is a win-win.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Don't get confused dealing with changes in your company's insurance plan.
