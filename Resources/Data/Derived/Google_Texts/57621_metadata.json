It also brought a legal quirk that is nothing to smile about.\n\nThe law\u2019s confusing treatment of pediatric dental benefits forces childless people to buy separate pediatric dental insurance policies they will never use. And states\u2019 varying interpretations of the law require parents to take extra care to make sure their kids get the dental benefits they need.\n\nI\u2019m middle-aged and I have no kids. But when I bought an individual health insurance policy from New York insurer Empire BlueCross Blue Shield, the salesperson insisted the law required me to buy a separate pediatric dental policy. So I pay $4.50 per month \u2014 or $54 per year \u2014 for an insurance policy that gives me no benefits.\n\nInsurers sell similar policies to childless adults in California, Colorado, Washington and other states.\n\nElsewhere \u2014 including Connecticut, Rhode Island and the District of Columbia \u2014 pediatric dental insurance is embedded in everyone\u2019s Obamacare coverage, said Colin Reusch, senior policy analyst at the Washington-based Children\u2019s Dental Project.\n\nIncluding pediatric dental coverage with emergency room care, doctor\u2019s office visits and other mandatory health insurance coverage saves everyone money. If New York embedded pediatric dental in my health policy, my total Empire BlueCross premium might drop a couple of bucks per month, Reusch said.\n\nEmbedding the coverage also makes sure children are always covered under their parents\u2019 health policies, he added. That\u2019s easier than covering them under separate, dental-only policies like those sold to adults.\n\nBut embedding pediatric dental coverage brings a different set of issues. Some health policies impose the same high deductibles on pediatric dental services as on other benefits, Reusch notes. That can make a routine trip to the dentist overly expensive. Reusch says parents should seek health policies with lower deductibles for pediatric dental care.\n\nParents need to pay attention to the issue if they plan to shop for health insurance when the next Obamacare open enrollment period begins Nov. 15.\n\nThe pediatric dental insurance oddity comes from a collision between Obamacare, states\u2019 traditional regulation of the insurance industry, and the U.S. tradition of selling dental insurance separately from health insurance.\n\nPediatric care \u2014 including pediatric dental care \u2014 is among the basic coverages all health insurers must provide new enrollees in individual and small group policies under the Affordable Care Act, which is Obamacare\u2019s formal name. Pediatric dental care isn\u2019t required for group policies offered by large employers, though insurers generally provide it anyhow.\n\nOther coverages are also mandatory under Affordable Care Act rules. Everyone with an individual or group Obamacare policy is covered for maternity and newborn care \u2013 including men and women beyond childbearing age. Obamacare policies also must include hospital care, mental health and substance abuse services, and prescription drugs.\n\nEveryone pays for those mandatory, embedded coverages, even if they don\u2019t need them. Obamacare is insurance, and one of the ideas behind insurance is to share costs among a broad group of people.\n\nTwo-thirds of cancer survivors incur debt (3:06) Roughly two-thirds of cancer survivors do not have enough household income to cover treatment-related expenses.\n\nBut when it passed the Affordable Care Act, Congress decided pediatric dental care would be handled differently. The law permits pediatric dental to be sold separately, like adult dental insurance. Reusch said Congress probably passed the rule to minimize disruption to the traditional dental insurance marketplace.\n\nThe law also left it to states to figure out how to provide pediatric dental coverage. So different states have different rules. Some embed pediatric dental in all Obamacare policies, while others mandate that it be sold separately.\n\nIt gets worse: Even within state governments, the rules are interpreted in different ways.\n\nIn New York, a spokesperson for the state Department of Health said Empire BlueCross is wrong to sell separate pediatric dental coverage to childless customers like me. But another agency, the Department of Financial Services, contradicted the Health Department by saying separate pediatric dental policies can be required. Empire says it follows Department of Financial Services rules.\n\nWhat happened in Colorado was weirder. Under the state\u2019s rules, insurer Delta Dental provides special pediatric dental policies to the childless for a monthly premium of $0.\n\nColorado insurers can\u2019t charge the childless more than $1.50 per month for separate pediatric dental coverage, \u201cbecause it is a no-benefit policy,\u201d said a spokesperson for Colorado\u2019s Department of Regulatory Agencies.\n\nSome Colorado insurers embed pediatric dental care in Obamacare policies, while others sell it separately, said Adam Fox of the Colorado Consumer Health Initiative. \u201cIt\u2019s left up to the insurers,\u201d he said.\n\nSome states are trying to fix the mess. California will require pediatric dental insurance to be embedded in all Obamacare policies next year, and thus will end the practice of selling separate policies to the childless.\n\nUntil it\u2019s fixed everywhere, buyer beware.\n\nBill Sanderson blogs about New York-area utilities at www.nypowerandlight.com.", "article_metadata": {"lifp_basePath": "https://id.marketwatch.com/access", "twitter": {"domain": "marketwatch.com", "image": {"width": 1320, "identifier": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-CV198_dentis_ZG_20140929122118.jpg", "height": 742}, "description": "Obamacare\u2019s confusing treatment of pediatric dental benefits forces childless people to buy separate pediatric dental insurance policies they will never use", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": {"id": 624413}}, "parsely-author": "Bill Sanderson", "article.content_group": "marketwatch", "article.section": "Personal Finance", "parsely-type": "post", "description": "Obamacare\u2019s confusing treatment of pediatric dental benefits forces childless people to buy separate pediatric dental insurance policies they will never use", "parsely-link": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/obamacare-quirk-makes-childless-people-buy-pediatric-dental-insurance-2014-09-30", "author": "Bill Sanderson", "parsely-title": "Obamacare quirk makes childless people buy pediatric dental insurance", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=336693422", "parsely-pub-date": "2014-10-01T15:59:00-04:00", "page.site": "marketwatch", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 283204329838}, "parsely-section": "MW_Personal Finance", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "og": {"site_name": "MarketWatch", "description": "Obamacare\u2019s confusing treatment of pediatric dental benefits forces childless people to buy separate pediatric dental insurance policies they will never use", "title": "Obamacare quirk makes childless people buy pediatric dental insurance", "url": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/obamacare-quirk-makes-childless-people-buy-pediatric-dental-insurance-2014-09-30", "image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-CV198_dentis_ZG_20140929122118.jpg", "type": "article"}, "ob": {"image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-CV198_dentis_ZG_20140929122118.jpg"}, "article.id": "F673B280-48D4-11E4-8C86-DD05E4BE2CA9", "position": 1}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdaac6\"", "article_summary": "The law\u2019s confusing treatment of pediatric dental benefits forces childless people to buy separate pediatric dental insurance policies they will never use.\nThe pediatric dental insurance oddity comes from a collision between Obamacare, states\u2019 traditional regulation of the insurance industry, and the U.S. tradition of selling dental insurance separately from health insurance.\nUnder the state\u2019s rules, insurer Delta Dental provides special pediatric dental policies to the childless for a monthly premium of $0.\nThe law permits pediatric dental to be sold separately, like adult dental insurance.\nIncluding pediatric dental coverage with emergency room care, doctor\u2019s office visits and other mandatory health insurance coverage saves everyone money."}
