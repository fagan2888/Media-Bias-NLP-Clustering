Hillary Clinton’s campaign is launching a new web video on Monday in support of the Affordable Care Act, featuring an Andover high school graduate with a serious disease.

Hillary Clinton Hillary Clinton (D) is a candidate for president in 2016. More

The video features the Democratic presidential candidate and Meghan Richardson, who graduated from Merrimack Valley High School this month, speaking at the Water Street Bookstore in Exeter during Clinton’s discussion with supporters there in May.

The video release follows the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling last week on the Affordable Care Act.

"I have a chronic lung disease called cystic fibrosis," says Meghan in the web video. "So when (Hillary Clinton) had reached out, it was a really personal connection. Like, I'm here, I hear what you're saying to me, I will do my best."

According to the Clinton campaign, Richardson will turn 18 this year and cast her first vote in the 2016 election. She was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis as an infant and has been a patient at the Children’s Hospital at Dartmouth-Hitchcock. The campaign noted that when Richardson becomes an adult, she will stay on her parents’ health insurance plan.
