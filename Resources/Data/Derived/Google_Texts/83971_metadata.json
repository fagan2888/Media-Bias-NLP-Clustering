Prefab is not a fad\n\nOne of the biggest developments in recent years has been the adoption of prefabrication. For medical facilities, this means that plumbers, electricians, drywallers, and welders work off-site to build components such as headwalls, bathrooms, and other features with all the electrical, gas, plumbing, and nurse call lines integrated into a \u201cplug and play\u201d element. It\u2019s not only faster to build this way, but it\u2019s also safer, less expensive, and results in a higher quality.\n\n2. The landscape is changing\n\nWith the economics of healthcare increasingly rewarding outpatient care, I don\u2019t expect to see too many new medical centers in the near future. Hospitals will add facilities, build new wings, redevelop operating rooms, and the like, but trends suggest that big new hospital projects with new beds will be few and far between.\n\n3. Outpatient facilities are HOT\n\nYears before the Affordable Care Act emphasized preventive care, we were seeing the decline of hospitals and the rise of outpatient facilities. These projects are less expensive to build than inpatient hospitals while providing greater access to healthcare, especially in suburban and rural areas. With reform emphasizing prevention and outcomes, this trend will likely accelerate.\n\n4. Tilt-up: It\u2019s not just for warehouses anymore\n\nFor some medical office building (MOB) projects, we\u2019re using tilt-up construction, which involves pouring concrete panels on slabs and then using a crane to hoist them vertically to become the walls of the building. We can cast brick or other products into the panels to provide architectural interest. Tilt-up works especially well in suburban areas where you have the space to create staging areas. We recently put up a new MOB in just two days.\n\n5. Efficiency is king\n\nHealthcare reform is focused on rewarding outcomes, not procedures. Doing more for less seems to be the direction for most of us. For construction companies, it means innovating alongside our customers and continually adjusting to meet the needs of our healthcare clients.\n\n\n\nBob McCleskey\n\nWant to share your Top Five?
