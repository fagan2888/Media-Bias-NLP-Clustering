The revelation by the victims comes on the heels of another investigation by authorities where the guru is accused of sexual assault.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nGurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, 47, has led the India-based socio-spiritual organisation Dera Sacha Sauda (DSS) since 1990, and reportedly has an estimated 50 million followers and a net worth of approximately $40 million. A report by MSN.com describes Singh as being known as the \u201cguru in bling,\u201d because of his \u201cgarish\u201d clothes and jewelry.\n\nAccording to a report by The New Age Online, Singh told his followers that they had to cut off their testicles if they wanted to \u201cget closer to God.\u201d\n\nThe procedures were allegedly performed in 2000 at a medical facility located at Singh\u2019s ashram. The victims are coming forward now after news broke that Singh was under investigation by India\u2019s Central Bureau of Investigation for allegedly sexually assaulting female followers. Singh has also been questioned regarding the 2002 death of an investigative journalist, but has not been charged.\n\nNavkiran Singh, an attorney for one of the victims, Hans Raj Chauhan, told the media that his client and the other men \u201cwere told that only those who get castrated will be able to meet God,\u201d and feared being social outcasts if they refused to go through with the operations.\n\nAccording to the MSN.com report, gurus like Singh \u201cplay an integral role in daily life\u201d for many Indians, and are believed to help guide one\u2019s path to enlightenment. Many gurus receive not just substantial financial contributions but also intense spiritual devotion from their followers. In a particularly odd case, the followers of a dead guru in the state of Punjab have gone to court seeking the right to keep his body in a freezer, insisting that the man is not dead but merely meditating.\n\nFollow Sarah Rumpf on Twitter @rumpfshaker.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A religious Indian guru who is accused of convincing 400 of his male followers to get surgically castrated is being investigated by police in India.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "A religious Indian guru who is accused of convincing 400 of his male followers to get surgically castrated is being investigated by police in India.", "title": "Indian Guru Under Investigation for Persuading 400 Men to Chop Off Their Testicles", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/03/Gurmeet-Ram-Rahim-Singh.jpg", "height": 600}, "updated_time": "2015-03-04T08:52:01-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/texas/2015/03/04/indian-guru-persuaded-400-men-to-chop-off-their-testicles/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A religious Indian guru who is accused of convincing 400 of his male followers to get surgically castrated is being investigated by police in India.", "creator": "@rumpfshaker", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/03/Gurmeet-Ram-Rahim-Singh.jpg", "title": "Indian Guru Under Investigation for Persuading 400 Men to Chop Off Their Testicles", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "castration, guru, India, religion,Breitbart Texas,Indian Guru", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2015-03-04T08:24:56-07:00", "section": "Breitbart Texas", "modified_time": "2015-03-04T08:52:01-07:00", "tag": "religion", "categories": "Breitbart Texas"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc127\"", "article_summary": "The revelation by the victims comes on the heels of another investigation by authorities where the guru is accused of sexual assault.\nA report by MSN.com describes Singh as being known as the \u201cguru in bling,\u201d because of his \u201cgarish\u201d clothes and jewelry.\nAccording to the MSN.com report, gurus like Singh \u201cplay an integral role in daily life\u201d for many Indians, and are believed to help guide one\u2019s path to enlightenment.\nThe victims are coming forward now after news broke that Singh was under investigation by India\u2019s Central Bureau of Investigation for allegedly sexually assaulting female followers.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERA religious Indian guru who is accused of convincing 400 of his male followers to get surgically castrated is being investigated by police in India."}
