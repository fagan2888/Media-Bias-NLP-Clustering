The federal government is using taxpayer dollars wanting to enlarge the size and scope of the Medicaid program then pulling back the money. This will leave states on the hook for paying for such a mass expansion. Once again, the federal government is making promises that it cannot keep.\u201d\n\nTexas Governor Rick Perry\u2019s press secretary, Lucy Nash, told Breitbart Texas, \u201cMedicaid is a broken system that already consumes more than a quarter of our state budget. Accepting President Obama\u2019s Medicare expansion would only increase the amount that Texas would have to pay for a system that the President himself has said is broken. It would be irresponsible to continue to pump billions more taxpayer dollars into aprogram that we know is fundamentally broken.\u201d\n\nPerry, along with the state legislature, chose not to expand Medicaid in order to foster an environment of limited government where businesses may flourish and create jobs.\n\n\u201cIf anyone was in doubt, we in Texas have no intention to implement so-called state exchanges or to expand Medicaid under Obamacare,\u201d Perry said in July 2012. \u201cI will not be party to socializing healthcare and bankrupting my state in direct contradiction to our Constitution and our founding principles of limited government.\u201d\n\nBreitbart Texas previously reported on the media\u2019s effort to credit Obamacare for a national increase in Medicaid enrollment.\n\nBut nine states, including Texas, have actually seen a decrease in Medicaid enrollment since Obamacare went into effect. Since October, Texas saw a (-0.4) percent increase in enrollment. Data from the Obama Administration claims that 4.25 million people are currently enrolled in the state, down from 4.44 million in September 2013.\n\nJohn Davidson, a senior health care policy analyst at the Texas Public Policy Foundation, told Breitbart Texas that Lone Star State residents have been clear in what they want. \u201cThe Texas legislature chose not to expand Medicaid,\u201d he said. \u201cThere has been strong opposition to Medicaid expansion in Texas, and that\u2019s undeniable.\u201d\n\nFollow Kristin Tate on Twitter @KristinBTate.", "article_metadata": {"description": "HOUSTON, Texas--On Wednesday the Obama Administration released a document in which it complained about the decision of Texas--and 23 other U.S. states--to not expand Medicaid under Obamacare.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "HOUSTON, Texas--On Wednesday the Obama Administration released a document in which it complained about the decision of Texas--and 23 other U.S. states--to not expand Medicaid under Obamacare.", "title": "White House Pressures Texas to Expand Medicaid - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Breitbart-Texas/2014/07/01/obamacare_get_covered_reuters.jpg", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/texas/2014/07/03/white-house-pressures-texas-to-expand-medicaid/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "HOUSTON, Texas--On Wednesday the Obama Administration released a document in which it complained about the decision of Texas--and 23 other U.S. states--to not expand Medicaid under Obamacare.", "title": "White House Pressures Texas to Expand Medicaid - Breitbart", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Breitbart-Texas/2014/07/01/obamacare_get_covered_reuters.jpg", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Rick Perry, Twitter, White House,Breitbart Texas,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Breitbart Texas", "tag": "White House", "published_time": "2014-07-03T06:36:55-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart Texas"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd1f5\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThere has been strong opposition to Medicaid expansion in Texas, and that\u2019s undeniable.\u201dFollow Kristin Tate on Twitter @KristinBTate.\n\u201cThe Texas legislature chose not to expand Medicaid,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIf anyone was in doubt, we in Texas have no intention to implement so-called state exchanges or to expand Medicaid under Obamacare,\u201d Perry said in July 2012.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERHOUSTON, Texas\u2013On Wednesday the Obama Administration released a document in which it complained about the decision of Texas\u2013and 23 other U.S. states\u2013to not expand Medicaid under Obamacare.\nBut nine states, including Texas, have actually seen a decrease in Medicaid enrollment since Obamacare went into effect."}
