Louisville Metro Police have made an arrest in the triple homicide reported early Saturday in the 4200 block of Wheeler Avenue in southern Louisville.

Police said Sunday morning that George Slaughter, 26, has been charged with three counts of murder and tampering with physical evidence in connection with the three deaths. He was being held at Metro Corrections under a $1 million cash bond and was scheduled to be arraigned Monday.

Police said no additional arrests are expected.

A police news release said that at 10 p.m. Saturday the metro police Ninth Mobile Divison and Fugitive Unit developed information that the suspect was at an apartment on Mildenhall Way. He was taken into custody without incident, police said.

The victims, two men and a woman, had not been identified as of Sunday afternoon.

The three people were found dead at a home on Wheeler around 3:20 a.m. Saturday, after police responded to a call. Police said the victims appeared to be in their 40s and that at least one of the victims may have been living in the house.

The house is in a neighborhood north of Iroquois Park, near the Watterson Expressway and Taylor Boulevard.

Saints Simon and Jude Catholic Church is across Hazelwood Avenue, which intersects with Wheeler Avenue. The 4200 block of Wheeler faces a medical office complex across the street and Saints Mary and Elizabeth Hospital sits behind the houses.
