That\u2019s an apartment complex serving people who\u2019ve been homeless and who have complicated health problems.\n\nIn the year before the residents moved in, their average healthcare costs were about $2,000 a month \u2014 or more than four times higher than the average Medicaid recipient\u2019s.\n\nIn the year after they moved in, the costs dropped to about $900 a month.\n\nSandra Clark with Health Share of Oregon says the study suggests the government can save on everything from jails to police to health care by housing homeless people.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just profound to me that even just counting Medicaid dollars, you can see the savings,\u201d she said.\n\nThe study is small.
