And in Waco, Texas, a man was sentenced to a year in jail after he strangled and tried to eat his roommate\u2019s dog while under the influence.\n\nLaw enforcement authorities across the U.S. are ramping up their efforts to curb synthetic marijuana use, with NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton this month calling the drug \u201cweaponized marijuana\u201d that makes users \u201ctotally crazy.\u201d\n\nBut a lack of testing capabilities to identify the drugs is leaving a large loophole in lawmakers\u2019 plans. The scare-tactic rhetoric and new laws banning sale of the drugs may put a dent in use in the short-term, but health and public safety experts say that only with more accessible and widespread testing methods will law enforcement be able to reliably confirm who is using or selling synthetic marijuana and to draw up charges.\n\nExperts say a large part of the appeal of synthetic marijuana, often known by nicknames such as Spice or K2, is the fact it\u2019s unlikely to show up in standard drug tests. The drugs\u2019 popularity has been particularly pronounced among individuals who are subject to drug tests either for work, such as those in the military, or under court-ordered supervision, said Marilyn Huestis, Chief of Chemistry and Drug Metabolism at the National Institute on Drug Abuse.\n\nThe desire to skirt court-ordered drug tests is a big factor in the rising popularity of synthetic drugs in areas where large swaths of residents are under correctional supervision, particularly among poor communities of color, said Joseph Richardson, a researcher with the University of Maryland\u2019s Center for Substance Abuse Research.\n\n\u201cMost guys are only shifting over to smoke it because they were on probation or parole,\u201d said Mr. Richardson, who is currently studying the correlation between synthetic marijuana use and violence. \u201cIt was an alternative.\u201d\n\nAnd in communities where a high proportion of the population may be under community-based correctional supervision, the desire to smoke synthetics to avoid a positive drug test is likely rubbing off on others.\n\n\u201cIf you have a disproportionate number of people who are under supervision and they are smoking, even if you don\u2019t smoke it, you may be in the same social network, and that may influence your decision to smoke it,\u201d Mr. Richardson said.\n\nThe Department of Defense announced in 2013 it would begin incorporating synthetic drug screens in its standard drug tests after discovering through a sample drug test that military members were using synthetics at higher rates than other drugs.\n\nPart of the consternation in combating synthetic marijuana is its ever-evolving nature. Classified as \u201csynthetic cannabinoids,\u201d the drugs are synthetic compounds cooked up in laboratories in China and often sprayed onto herbs or plant material. The chemists who synthesize the drugs can easily change (and consistently do) a few chemical components to create a brand-new drug \u2014 one that may not be explicitly banned by existing law but still creates a high for the user.\n\nThough the U.S. has federally banned 26 types of synthetic drugs, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration has identified more than 300 derivatives being sold.\n\nThe ability to rapidly change the compounds creates problems twofold: If laws can\u2019t keep up with the newest chemical structure, the drugs are not technically illegal, and if the chemical compounds are ever changing, it\u2019s tough to keep tests up to date in order to identify the drugs themselves or suspected users.\n\nThat means difficulty for law enforcement officials trying to bring charges against a person caught with synthetic marijuana as police must wait until lab tests confirm that the compounds in the drug are banned.\n\n\u201cSpecial testing labs are completely backed up trying to test it,\u201d said DEA spokesman Rusty Payne. \u201cIf we\u2019re looking at somebody undercover, we can go make an undercover buy and have it tested before we take action. If it\u2019s something that happens along the way, it can take some time.\u201d\n\nAs the cat and mouse game evolves, prosecutors have been able to go after distributors based on current laws that allow synthetic drugs to be treated as controlled substances if they have \u201csubstantially similar\u201d chemical structures and are meant for human consumption. But prosecutors have been hesitant to use the same statute to go after lesser crimes, such as driving under the influence, because of concern they won\u2019t be able to prove the drugs are \u201cpharmacologically the same,\u201d Dr. Huestis said.\n\nWashington, D.C., has been among the cities grappling to get a hold on rising synthetic drug use \u2014 with emergency workers recently transporting as many as 24 synthetic marijuana overdose patients a day to area hospitals.\n\nData published by the Pew Charitable Trusts in 2009 estimates that 1 in 35 adult Washingtonians are on either parole or probation, and another 1 in 50 are incarcerated. And with officials cognizant of the correlation between correctional supervision and synthetic drug use, they are hoping synthetic drug testing will finally provide some relief.\n\nThe city\u2019s Pretrial Services Agency, which oversees drug testing for individuals awaiting trial, is working now to incorporate synthetic drug testing into their panel of drug screens.\n\n\u201cWe think it will have a deterrent effect,\u201d said Leslie Cooper, the agency\u2019s deputy director. \u201cIf people think they can get away with something, they are going to try to push the boundaries of what they can get away with.\u201d\n\nFrom a public health standpoint, new testing developments will also help hospital workers learn more about the bad reactions that users are having to the drugs and whether they could be brought on by certain doses, chemicals or combinations with other illegal substances.\n\n\u201cEarly on it was shown that even if you bought from the same distributor, the same name, that a product bought the same day could have totally different drugs in it and totally different concentrations. There is absolutely no quality control at all in these products,\u201d Dr. Huestis said. \u201cA big part of our problem is figuring out which drug was taken and to tie it to adverse events that occur.\u201d\n\nTo that end, D.C. hospitals are also beginning programs to test incoming patients exhibiting signs of synthetic marijuana use for the drugs.\n\nAnything to help spread the word about the dangerous side effects of synthetics is welcome news to law enforcement.\n\n\u201cWe are not going to arrest our way out of it. We\u2019ve got to get people to realize this stuff is nasty and deadly,\u201d Mr. Payne said. \u201cIf we can\u2019t get our arms around the demand for the drugs, we are in trouble.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Horror stories attributed to synthetic marijuana use are in no short supply -- often complete with graphic details involving crazed, naked maniacs or catatonic zombies.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Horror stories attributed to synthetic marijuana use are in no short supply \u2014 often complete with graphic details involving crazed, naked maniacs or catatonic zombies.", "title": "Synthetic marijuana: Drug test shortcomings foil crackdown efforts", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/20/synthetic-marijuana-drug-test-shortcomings-foil-cr/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/20/drugs.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/20/drugs.jpg", "description": "Horror stories attributed to synthetic marijuana use are in no short supply -- often complete with graphic details involving crazed, naked maniacs or catatonic zombies.", "card": "summary", "title": "Synthetic marijuana: Drug test shortcomings foil crackdown efforts"}, "Author": "Andrea Noble", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Health Medical Pharma, Social Issues"}, "article_summary": "The city\u2019s Pretrial Services Agency, which oversees drug testing for individuals awaiting trial, is working now to incorporate synthetic drug testing into their panel of drug screens.\nAnd with officials cognizant of the correlation between correctional supervision and synthetic drug use, they are hoping synthetic drug testing will finally provide some relief.\nHorror stories attributed to synthetic marijuana use are in no short supply \u2014 often complete with graphic details involving crazed, naked maniacs or catatonic zombies.\nWashington, D.C., has been among the cities grappling to get a hold on rising synthetic drug use \u2014 with emergency workers recently transporting as many as 24 synthetic marijuana overdose patients a day to area hospitals.\nPart of the consternation in combating synthetic marijuana is its ever-evolving nature."}
