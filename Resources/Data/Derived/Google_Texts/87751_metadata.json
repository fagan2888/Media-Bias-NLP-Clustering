Last round, Warren connected with a big left hook, slamming the TPP as a bad deal for the middle class and saying that\u2019s the big reason Obama\u2019s people are negotiating it in secret. On Friday, in a conference call with a group of journalists, however, the president reminded Warren why they call it a \u201cbully pulpit.\u201d Without calling her out by name, Obama answered Warren with some stiff right jabs: Critics, he says, are being \u201cdishonest\u201d about the TPP by suggesting it\u2019s a closed-door process and are spreading \u201cmisinformation\u201d to rile up the liberal base. Then he delivered a nasty one-two combination: \u201cThe one that gets on my nerves the most is the notion that this is a \u2018secret\u2019 deal. Every single one of the critics who I hear saying, \u2018This is a secret deal,\u2019 or send out emails to their fundraising base saying they\u2019re working to prevent this secret deal, can walk over today and read the text of the agreement. There\u2019s nothing secret about it.\u201d Ouch \u2013 that had to sting.
