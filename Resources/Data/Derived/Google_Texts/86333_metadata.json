Here are some things that Texans are not conflicted over: How we feel about Barack Obama (we don\u2019t like him), if UT and A&M should play each other gain (most definitely), who we want the Democratic nominee for president to be (Hillary Clinton), and toll roads (we actually like them). That\u2019s the takeaway from Crosswind Media and Public Relations\u2019 Texas Pulse Poll from September, which used a sample of 1,000 likely Texas voters to get a feel for where the state stands on divisive topics like politics, football, and ice cream.\n\nThe poll breaks down issues down by political alignment, which reveals that\u2014among other things\u2014there are very few topics on which liberal and conservative Texans agree. For example, a full half of conservatives identified immigration as the top issue facing the state, with the economy coming in a distant second place with 15 percent of the response. Liberals, meanwhile, are much less concerned, with only 10 percent naming immigration, which is behind health care, education and the economy, and social issues.\n\nAll of which tends to make sense: Republicans control the agenda in Texas, and they\u2019ve largely gotten the results they want on health care, education, and social issues\u2014but immigration and border policy, which is set by federal policy, is out of their hands. Democrats, who\u2019ve been out of power for a generation, have watched GOP leadership move those issues away from where they\u2019d like them to be. The economy and jobs, meanwhile\u2014issues the legislature has little control over\u2014have the attention of both groups.\n\nHere\u2019s where things get weird, though: Conservatives don\u2019t identify the health care system as a political priority, but they sure aren\u2019t happy with it. Two-thirds of Texas Republicans express dissatisfaction with the health care system (compared to only 38 percent of Democrats), which seems surprising. It\u2019s likely that when people are asked \u201chow do you feel about the state of health care right now,\u201d though, most respondents hear \u201chow do you feel about Obamacare,\u201d which probably helps explain the discrepancy\u2014\u201dhealth care in Texas is not my top priority\u201d and \u201cI am dissatisfied with the current state of health care\u201d aren\u2019t necessarily incompatible statements, if you look at them through the political lens.\n\nNot a huge surprise here: Barack Obama enjoys a 10 percent approval rating among Texas conservatives, with a whopping 74 percent feeling \u201cvery unfavorable\u201d toward the president. And because of the rate at which Republicans outnumber Democrats in Texas, that tilts things pretty heavily in the \u201cunfavorable\u201d category across the board: Obama\u2019s approval rating in Texas is at 41 percent, a full seven points lower than the national average. (We\u2019re not sure what\u2019s up with the 1 percent of Texas Republicans of the 3 percent of Democrats who\u2019ve never heard of him, though.)\n\nBut it\u2019s not all blind partisanship: Texas Republicans like Governor Greg Abbott considerably less than Texas Democrats like Barack Obama. Although 86 percent of Texas Dems approve of the President, only 77 percent of Texas Republicans have a favorable impression of the governor. (Democrats, meanwhile, feel considerably more charitable toward Abbott than their Republican counterparts do about Obama, with Abbott\u2019s approval rating among Dems at 24 percent, compared to Obama\u2019s 10 percent.) Interestingly, the same percentage of both conservatives and liberals are unsure how they feel about the first-term governor, with 4 percent of each group unable to decide how to answer.\n\nAbbott is better-liked across the board than Ted Cruz, though. Abbott\u2019s 54 percent approval rating is markedly better than Cruz\u2019s 48 percent, and Texas Democrats despise Cruz almost as much as Republicans dislike Obama. More interesting, though, is how Cruz polarizes people in ways that Abbott does not. Fewer Texas Republicans have a favorable impression of Cruz (72 percent) than have a favorable impression of the governor (77 percent)\u2014but his \u201cvery favorable\u201d numbers are stronger than Abbott\u2019s. (Democrats, meanwhile, are much more likely to deem Cruz \u201cvery unfavorable\u201d than Abbott.) So Cruz\u2019s support may not be as broad as Abbott\u2019s, but the people who like the junior senator really love him, and the people who don\u2019t friggin\u2019 hate the guy.\n\nThe poll only asked self-identified conservatives about the GOP primary (and self-identified liberals about the Democratic candidates). With that in mind, the Texas numbers largely mirror those of the rest of the country\u2014Donald Trump has 26 percent of the support here vs. 23.3 percent nationally, and Ben Carson is at 19 percent in Texas vs. 16.3 percent nationally. There is one crucial exception: Ted Cruz is polling at 6 percent in the rest of the country, but down in Texas, he\u2019s the third-place candidate at 15 percent. His support seems to come largely at the expense of Marco Rubio and Carly Fiorina, who are both polling at our near double digits nationally, but neither of whom can currently break 3 percent in Texas.\n\nHillary Clinton, meanwhile, does much better among Texas Democrats than she does in the rest of the country. Nationally, Clinton polls at a healthy 40.8 percent\u2014a solid number, but not necessarily an insurmountable one. Here, though, she enjoys a whopping 53 percent of the Democrats\u2019 support. It seems unlikely at the moment that the Democratic race for the nomination will run long enough for a Texas primary to be relevant, but if it does, Clinton should look forward to it.\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, football is also a deeply divisive topic amongst Texans. This poll took place before last weekend, so the University of Texas had yet to lose its second game of the year\u2014but still, even then, there were as many Texans who thought the unranked Longhorns were as likely to make the playoff as fifth ranked Baylor. That could mean a few things: UT fans are a massive, if delusional, group; most people who responded don\u2019t actually pay much attention to college football; or people really don\u2019t have much faith in Baylor. But it\u2019s interesting that political ideology plays into the outcome here, too: Conservatives leaned heavily on TCU (25 percent) and A&M (23 percent), while 24 percent of liberals managed to convince themselves that this was gonna be UT\u2019s year. (Maybe Battleground Texas has some more explaining to do?)\n\nBlue Bell is back! And 69 percent of Texans do not care that the company\u2019s ice cream literally killed people before it was removed from shelves. (Another 16 percent of us haven\u2019t ruled out giving the company another chance.) That\u2019s not a shock\u2014Blue Bell has been synonymous with \u201cice cream\u201d in Texas for a long time, and the enthusiasm when it returned to shelves gave us some anecdotal reasons to believe that this wasn\u2019t a deal-breaker. What\u2019s interesting is that even when we\u2019re talking about ice cream, politics are a factor: Conservatives feel much more strongly about Blue Bell than liberals do, with 57 percent of self-identified conservative respondents declaring themselves \u201cvery likely\u201d to put Blue Bell in their freezer, compared to a mere 34 percent of liberals.\n\nView the full poll here.\n\n(charts courtesy of Crosswind Media and Public Relations)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.categories": "Politics,Sports,", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.texasmonthly.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2015/10/1213803079_ec2b9ef2ed_o-300x300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "Dan Solomon", "description": "We like the president less than the rest of the country, but the real showdown is over Blue Bell.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "sailthru.link": "http://www.texasmonthly.com/the-daily-post/new-poll-reveals-how-texans-feel-about-obama-blue-bell-and-toll-roads/", "og": {"site_name": "Texas Monthly", "description": "We like the president less than the rest of the country, but the real showdown is over Blue Bell.", "title": "New Poll Reveals How Texans Feel About Obama, Blue Bell, And Toll Roads - Texas Monthly", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://www.texasmonthly.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2015/10/1213803079_ec2b9ef2ed_o.jpg", "height": 720}, "updated_time": "2015-10-02T14:46:42-05:00", "url": "http://www.texasmonthly.com/the-daily-post/new-poll-reveals-how-texans-feel-about-obama-blue-bell-and-toll-roads/", "type": "article"}, "sailthru.image.221": "http://www.texasmonthly.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2015/10/1213803079_ec2b9ef2ed_o-220x278.jpg", "twitter": {"image": "http://www.texasmonthly.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2015/10/1213803079_ec2b9ef2ed_o.jpg", "description": "We like the president less than the rest of the country, but the real showdown is over Blue Bell.", "card": "summary", "title": "New Poll Reveals How Texans Feel About Obama, Blue Bell, And Toll Roads - Texas Monthly"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-10-02 13:41:52", "sailthru.image.100": "http://www.texasmonthly.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2015/10/1213803079_ec2b9ef2ed_o-100x120.jpg", "robots": "noodp", "sailthru.title": "New Poll Reveals How Texans Feel About Obama, Blue Bell, And Toll Roads", "sailthru.image.400": "http://www.texasmonthly.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2015/10/1213803079_ec2b9ef2ed_o-380x214.jpg", "sailthru.tags": "barack obama,Blue Bell,Crosswind,Donald Trump,Football,greg abbott,hillary clinton,polls,Ted Cruz,Politics,Sports,The Daily Post,", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "Ted Cruz", "published_time": "2015-10-02T13:41:52-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-02T14:46:42-05:00"}, "news_keywords": "barack obama, blue bell, crosswind, donald trump, football, greg abbott, hillary clinton, polls, ted cruz, texas, politics, food", "sailthru.description": "We like the president less than the rest of the country, but the real showdown is over Blue Bell.", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.texasmonthly.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2015/10/1213803079_ec2b9ef2ed_o-600x400.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "sailthru.image.150": "http://www.texasmonthly.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2015/10/1213803079_ec2b9ef2ed_o-150x150.jpg"}, "article_summary": "New Poll Reveals How Texans Feel About Obama, Blue Bell, And Toll RoadsWe like the president less than the rest of the country, but the real showdown is over Blue Bell.\nBut it\u2019s not all blind partisanship: Texas Republicans like Governor Greg Abbott considerably less than Texas Democrats like Barack Obama.\nHillary Clinton, meanwhile, does much better among Texas Democrats than she does in the rest of the country.\nAlthough 86 percent of Texas Dems approve of the President, only 77 percent of Texas Republicans have a favorable impression of the governor.\nTwo-thirds of Texas Republicans express dissatisfaction with the health care system (compared to only 38 percent of Democrats), which seems surprising."}
