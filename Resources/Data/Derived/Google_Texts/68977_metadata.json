Kendrick\u2019s day started off rocky, but he settled into a groove and departed with the game tied 2-2. He gave up five hits, but four of them came in the first inning.\n\nMarcell Ozuna\u2019s two-run single gave Miami a 2-0 lead in the first, but Kendrick set down the next 12 batters he faced.\n\nOzuna\u2019s single would have been a routine out for shortstop Troy Tulowitzki had the Rockies not shaded the infield to the right side.\n\n\u201cWe shifted,\u201d Kendrick said. \u201cSometimes you get bit in the (rear) like that, and sometimes it works out.\u201d\n\nKendrick lowered his ERA from 6.55 to 6.16, but his record remained 2-7.\n\nRafael Betancourt tossed glove into stands\n\nIt was clear Saturday that reliever Rafael Betancourt was displeased with his performance when he gave up three runs on five hits in the ninth inning of a 10-5 victory over the Marlins.\n\nThe 40-year-old right-hander pounded his glove in frustration after each hit. At game\u2019s end, he chucked the baseball into the right-field corner, then tossed his glove into the stands.\n\n\u201cWe had a good conversation,\u201d manager Walt Weiss said. \u201cRaffy will be fine. I don\u2019t worry about him.\u201d\n\nAsked if he monitors the players\u2019 tantrums on the field, Weiss said: \u201cWe talk about body language a lot. That\u2019s how you speak on the field. We always have a heightened sense of awareness for what we say with how we act.\u201d\n\nBetancourt, who\u2019s been suffering from a sinus condition, blew a save against the Dodgers on Tuesday, giving up a grand slam home run to Alex Guerrero in the ninth inning.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more his strength than anything else \u2014 he\u2019s been weak, he hasn\u2019t recovered from whatever he had a week ago,\u201d Weiss said of Betancourt. \u201cBut his arm feels great.\u201d\n\nJohn Axford is a shut-down closer\n\nJohn Axford continues to dominate hitters. He set the Marlins down in order in the ninth inning Sunday.\n\nIt was his 12th consecutive appearance without allowing a run, dating to May 6.\n\nHe has allowed only one earned run all season, and his ERA is 0.53.\n\nLooking ahead\n\nCardinals\u2019 John Lackey (4-3, 2.93 ERA) at Rockies\u2019 David Hale (1-0, 4.26), 6:40 p.m. Monday, ROOT; 850 AM\n\nHale, twice added as the 26th man in a doubleheader, has become the Rockies\u2019 utility starter. He will be recalled from Triple-A again for Monday\u2019s game against the Cardinals. He has pitched reasonably well, but served up three homers to the Dodgers in his last start at Coors Field. Pitching for Atlanta last season, he threw two scoreless innings of relief vs. the Cardinals. Lackey, 36, gave up three runs and 10 hits over seven innings against the Brewers in his last start. He wasn\u2019t dominant, but did enough to earn his fourth victory. He is 2-1 with a 4.59 ERA in four starts vs. the Rockies; 0-1 with a 6.39 ERA in two starts at Coors Field.\n\nTuesday: Cardinals\u2019 Michael Wacha (8-1, 2.18 ERA) at Rockies\u2019 Jorge De La Rosa (2-2, 6.15), 6:40 p.m., ROOT\n\nWednesday: Cardinals\u2019 Carlos Martinez (6-2, 2.94) at Rockies\u2019 Chad Bettis (2-0, 2.70), 1:10 p.m., no TV\n\nThursday: Rockies\u2019 Eddie Butler (3-6, 4.80) at Marlins\u2019 David Phelps (2-3, 4.68), 5:10 p.m., ROOT\n\nPatrick Saunders, The Denver Post", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Kyle Kendrick\u2019s season is on the upswing for Rockies", "title": "Kyle Kendrick\u2019s season is on the upswing for Rockies", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/06/07/kyle-kendricks-season-is-on-the-upswing-for-rockies/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150607__kyle-kendrickp1.jpg", "height": 431}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150607__kyle-kendrickp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-07T21:32:28+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T18:55:58+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Kyle Kendrick\u2019s up-and-down season was on the upswing Sunday.\nToo bad the Rockies didn\u2019t swing their bats better in a 3-2 loss to the Miami Marlins at Coors Field.\nHe has allowed only one earned run all season, and his ERA is 0.53.\nHe is 2-1 with a 4.59 ERA in four starts vs. the Rockies; 0-1 with a 6.39 ERA in two starts at Coors Field.\nKendrick\u2019s day started off rocky, but he settled into a groove and departed with the game tied 2-2."}
