The Gulf Cemetery located in Santa Rosa Beach celebrated its 100th anniversary and received a special recognition from the state of Florida.

Over 400 people attended Monday's Memorial Day ceremonies at the cemetery in South Walton county.

The ceremony included the lowering of the flag to half staff, speeches, a piper playing "Amazing Grace" and the traditional taps to close the ceremony.

At the end of the ceremony World War II airplanes known as the Warbirds flew over in the missing man formation.

In special recognition of its heritage to the community, the state officially designated the cemetery as a historical site, one of 700 such sites designated since 1961.

"I came here years ago with my husband and, a couple of others, Bob Freeze, and a few others and we had a service and there were only about five people here on Memorial Day. How long ago was that? Thirty years ago," Lisbeth Jones, whose husband is buried at Gulf Cemetery, said.
