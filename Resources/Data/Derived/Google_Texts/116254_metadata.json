Yesterday, the New York Times* ran a story titled, \"Slowly They Modernize: A Federal Agency That Still Uses Floppy Disks\":\n\nThe technology troubles that plagued the HealthCare.gov website rollout may not have come as a shock to people who work for certain agencies of the government \u2014 especially those who still use floppy disks, the cutting-edge technology of the 1980s. Every day, The Federal Register, the daily journal of the United States government, publishes on its website and in a thick booklet around 100 executive orders, proclamations, proposed rule changes and other government notices that federal agencies are mandated to submit for public inspection. So far, so good. It turns out, however, that the Federal Register employees who take in the information for publication from across the government still receive some of it on the 3.5-inch plastic storage squares that have become all but obsolete in the United States. Now government infrastructure experts are hoping that public embarrassments like the HealthCare.gov debacle will prompt a closer look at the government\u2019s technological prowess, especially if it might mean getting rid of floppy disks. \u201cYou\u2019ve got this antiquated system that still works but is not nearly as efficient as it could be,\u201d said Stan Soloway, chief executive of the Professional Services Council, which represents more than 370 government contractors. \u201cCompanies that work with the government, whether longstanding or newcomers, are all hamstrung by the same limitations.\u201d The use of floppy disks peaked in American homes and offices in the mid-1990s, and modern computers do not even accommodate them anymore. But The Federal Register continues to accept them, in part because legal and security requirements have yet to be updated, but mostly because the wheels of government grind ever slowly.\n\nThe mid-1990s you say? That was when Newt Gingrich, newly ascendant as the first GOP speaker of the House in 40 years, was barnstorming the country (to use another retro phrase) with technowonk speeches in which he noted how outmoded much of government was. Gingrich would use as visual prop another technology that was largely obsolete** in 1995: he would hold up a vacuum tube, like something out of your grandfather\u2019s TV set \u2014 or an FAA air traffic control tower in 1995:\n\nThe big battles will deal with how we remake the Government of the United States. The measure of everything we do will be whether we are creating a better future with more opportunities for our children. New ideas, new ways and old-fashioned common sense can improve government while reducing its costs. Let me give you an example. The United States Government is the largest purchaser of vacuum tubes in the Western world. This is a Federal Aviation Administration vacuum tube. Good solid 1895 technology. This is the updated mid-1950s version. When you fly in America, vacuum tubes in the air traffic control system keep you safe. Our purchasing rules are so complicated and so wasteful that our government has not been able in seven years to figure out how to replace vacuum tubes with this. This is a microchip that has the computing power of 3 million vacuum tubes. So today\u2019s government operates this way; after we remake it, the government of the future will operate this way. My point is this: this same reliance on the obsolete pervades most of the federal government\u2013not just in regard to computers but in regard to its thinking, its attitudes, its approaches to problems. It\u2019s one thing if we\u2019re talking about vacuum tubes, but this backward thinking is entirely something else if we\u2019re talking about human lives.\n\nAnd we are. An AP story in late September foreshadowed the Obamacare Website horrors to come with a shocking reference to the F-word:\n\nAdministration officials are quietly telling key interest groups to expect initial glitches signing up online for coverage under President Barack Obama\u2019s health care overhaul. Two sources tell The Associated Press that small businesses will not be able to enroll online starting Oct. 1 when new health insurance markets go live. Instead, one of the sources, a person who was briefed on the situation, said business owners will initially have to mail or fax their information so that they can enroll. The sources spoke on condition of anonymity because an official announcement hasn\u2019t yet been made.\n\nIf you're getting a sense that the Leviathan federal government is connected together with bailing wire, string, fax machines, and floppy disks, you're not alone -- and you're one up on the president, as we'll explore right after the page break.", "article_metadata": {"page-title": "LudditeCare: A Federal Agency That Still Uses Floppy Disks | Ed Driscoll", "pinterest": "nopin", "og": {"site_name": "Ed Driscoll", "description": "Floppy disks and fax machines: It's only fair that 19th century-style socialized medicine runs on 1995-era technology.", "title": "LudditeCare: A Federal Agency That Still Uses Floppy Disks", "url": "https://pjmedia.com/eddriscoll/2013/12/7/ludditecare/", "image": "https://pajamasmed.hs.llnwd.net/e1/static/2000392/images/default-og-image.jpg", "updated_time": 1464084616, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Floppy disks and fax machines: It's only fair that 19th century-style socialized medicine runs on 1995-era technology.", "title": "LudditeCare: A Federal Agency That Still Uses Floppy Disks", "url": "https://pjmedia.com/eddriscoll/2013/12/7/ludditecare/", "image": "https://pajamasmed.hs.llnwd.net/e1/static/2000392/images/default-og-image.jpg", "site": "@PJMedia_com", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "LudditeCare: A Federal Agency That Still Uses Floppy Disks | Ed Driscoll", "pinterestDescription": "LudditeCare: A Federal Agency That Still Uses Floppy Disks", "fb": {"app_id": 149848758413844}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd331e\"", "article_summary": "Now government infrastructure experts are hoping that public embarrassments like the HealthCare.gov debacle will prompt a closer look at the government\u2019s technological prowess, especially if it might mean getting rid of floppy disks.\nWhen you fly in America, vacuum tubes in the air traffic control system keep you safe.\nIt\u2019s one thing if we\u2019re talking about vacuum tubes, but this backward thinking is entirely something else if we\u2019re talking about human lives.\nIf you're getting a sense that the Leviathan federal government is connected together with bailing wire, string, fax machines, and floppy disks, you're not alone -- and you're one up on the president, as we'll explore right after the page break.\nThe United States Government is the largest purchaser of vacuum tubes in the Western world."}
