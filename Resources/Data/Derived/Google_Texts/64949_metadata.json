Meanwhile, the Affordable Care Act explicitly prohibits undocumented immigrants from using the Obamacare marketplaces at all.\n\nClinton said that the question of whether undocumented immigrants should be eligible for subsidies will \"have to be worked out in comprehensive immigration reform.\"\n\n\"What I do want to see is that we have more options for undocumented people to be able to get the health care they need,\" she explained. \"It's not only the right and moral thing to do for them. It's also important that we keep ourselves healthy, and public health requires that. So I see this as a two-step process.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "&quot;I see this as a two-step process,&quot; Clinton said with respect to expanding health insurance access to undocumented immigrants", "og": {"url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/hillary-clinton-explains-her-stance-on-obamacare-for-undocumented-immigrants/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2016/03/22/6ce3a060-ac4c-42f1-8897-b2326ac38b15/thumbnail/1200x630/4df377cda484c536b9b2b36a4ba6adc0/2016-03-21t160333z52164115tb3ec3l18lmchrtrmadp3usa-election-clinton-aipac.jpg", "height": 630}, "type": "article", "description": "\"I see this as a two-step process,\" Clinton said with respect to expanding health insurance access to undocumented immigrants", "title": "Hillary Clinton explains her stance on Obamacare for undocumented immigrants"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"I see this as a two-step process,\" Clinton said with respect to expanding health insurance access to undocumented immigrants", "title": "Hillary Clinton explains her stance on Obamacare for undocumented immigrants", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "cbsnewsapp://news/hillary-clinton-explains-her-stance-on-obamacare-for-undocumented-immigrants/", "iphone": "cbsnewsapp://news/hillary-clinton-explains-her-stance-on-obamacare-for-undocumented-immigrants/", "googleplay": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/hillary-clinton-explains-her-stance-on-obamacare-for-undocumented-immigrants/"}, "country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "CBS News", "iphone": "CBS News", "googleplay": "CBS News"}, "id": {"ipad": 334256223, "iphone": 334256223, "googleplay": "com.treemolabs.apps.cbsnews"}}, "creator": "@http://twitter.com/stephcondoncbs", "site": "@CBSPolitics", "image": "http://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2016/03/22/6ce3a060-ac4c-42f1-8897-b2326ac38b15/thumbnail/1200x630/4df377cda484c536b9b2b36a4ba6adc0/2016-03-21t160333z52164115tb3ec3l18lmchrtrmadp3usa-election-clinton-aipac.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"web": {"url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/hillary-clinton-explains-her-stance-on-obamacare-for-undocumented-immigrants/"}, "android": {"app_name": "CBS News", "package": "com.treemolabs.apps.cbsnews"}, "ios": {"url": "cbsnewsapp://news/hillary-clinton-explains-her-stance-on-obamacare-for-undocumented-immigrants/", "app_name": "CBS News", "app_store_id": 334256223}}, "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"app_id": 1536620209892267}, "keywords": "obamacare, immigration, hillary clinton", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CBSPolitics", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/Political-Hotsheet/"}, "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "obamacare, immigration, hillary clinton"}, "article_summary": "Hillary Clinton on Monday night explained the way she would at least partially expand access to Obamacare to undocumented immigrants.\nMeanwhile, the Affordable Care Act explicitly prohibits undocumented immigrants from using the Obamacare marketplaces at all.\nClinton said that the question of whether undocumented immigrants should be eligible for subsidies will \"have to be worked out in comprehensive immigration reform.\"\nEven if an immigrant is not in the country legally, they should be able to pay full price for health insurance, she said.\nHowever, Clinton continued, \"it is not going to apply to people who are in need of subsidies in order to afford that.\""}
