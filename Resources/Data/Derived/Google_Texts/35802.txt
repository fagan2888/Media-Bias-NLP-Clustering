How much is a woman’s stomach worth these days? Evidently $70K, since that’s the amount that was extracted from a Belgium woman’s stomach who was flying into Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic last week. The stash of cash, swallowed via 16 tiny capsules, billowed her belly and troubled her tummy, but that didn’t stop the 40-year-old unnamed woman from becoming a drug mule.

Writes The Associated Press on Oct. 24, via ABC News: “Dominican Republic officials say they have arrested a woman who was carrying more than $70,000 U.S. dollars in her stomach and $69,000 hidden inside her suitcase. The spokesman for the National Drug Control Agency says the money in the woman's stomach was divided up among 16 capsules and the cash is likely tied to drug trafficking.”

The gal with the $70K stomach was arrested at the airport. News outlets did not report how officials were tipped off that the woman had a cache of money in her gut, nor did they say how they plan on getting it out. Dominican authorities confirmed they have never caught someone smuggling cash into their country before via their stomach. National Drug Control Agency Spokesman Dario Medrano said the woman was on a flight from Brussels, the capital city of Belgium, to the popular tourism destination in the DR.
