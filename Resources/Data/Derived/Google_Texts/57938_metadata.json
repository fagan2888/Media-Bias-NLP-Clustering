John Moolenaar was the financial underdog in his 4th District Republican congressional primary race against Paul Mitchell, the same cannot be said about the general election.\n\nAccording to reports submitted to the Federal Elections Commission, Moolenaar, R-Midland, has spent 15 times more than his Democratic opponent Jeff Holmes, D-Alma, from April 1 through Sept. 30.\n\nThe winner of the Nov. 4 general election will take the seat being vacated by longtime U.S. Rep. Dave Camp, R-Midland.\n\nMoolenaar, 53, has spent a total of $752,789 on his campaign while Holmes, 54, has spent a total of $49,940.\n\n\"We're working hard to raise funds and get our message out,\" said Moolenaar who is in the final year of his first, four-year term in the Michigan Senate.\n\nIf Moolenaar wins the 4th District race, he will vacate his spot serving as the 36th District state senator.\n\nAccording to Moolenaar, much of the funds his campaign earmarked for advertising went to combat negative ads run by Mitchell during the primary.\n\nMitchell, of Thomas Township, spent nearly $5 million of his own money in a bid to capture the congressional seat.\n\nWhile Moolenaar has spent more than $200,000 on television and radio advertising, only $601 of Holmes' expenditures have gone to advertising, according to his FEC filings.\n\n\"I think it helps him get more name recognition,\" Holmes said of Moolenaar's large campaign budget.\n\nDespite Holmes calling the race an \"uphill battle,\" he is working to get his name out to voters through means that don't cost money.\n\n\"I've had a lot of opportunities to attend candidate forums,\" Holmes said.\n\nBoth Holmes and Moolenaar are scheduled to take part in a Saginaw County candidate forum 6:45 p.m. Tuesday, Oct. 28, at Carrollton Middle School, 3211 Carla.\n\nThe candidates likely won't discuss their difference in spending during the forum, but they will discuss their differing political views.\n\nAccording to Holmes and Moolenaar, one of the key issues where they differ is the Affordable Care Act, also commonly referred to as Obamacare.\n\nIf elected, Moolenaar has stated he will work to repeal the Affordable Care Act, while Holmes has said he will work to support and improve it.\n\n\"I believe that there are serious flaws with Obamacare,\" Moolenaar said. \"It is a very flawed system to build a healthcare system on.\"\n\nHolmes, an Alma physician, stated he has seen the ways in which the Affordable Care Act has helped his patients.\n\n\"I could really help to inform the conversation,\" he said.\n\nMoolenaar and Holmes also differ on many issues where they stand on opposing party lines. Holmes is pro-choice while Moolenaar is pro-life; Holmes supports same-sex marriage while Moolenaar does not.\n\nDespite his clear financial lead, Moolenaar said he never planned to leave the campaign trail early.\n\n\"I'm gonna continue to run very hard,\" Moolenaar said. \"It's a process where I learn more about the district as I campaign in different parts of the district.\"\n\nMoolenaar's largest expenses include advertisements, a voter survey, direct mailing and yard signs while Holmes' largest expenses involve website design, software and consulting fees.\n\nSome of the largest expenditures by Moolenaar's campaign as listed on the FEC website:\n\nFour payments totaling $200,051 to Strategic Media Services of Arlington, Virginia for radio and television advertising\n\n$27,000 to Public Opinion Strategies, LLC of Alexandria, Virginia for a voter survey\n\nTwo payments totaling $20,679 to Arena Communications of Salt Lake City, Utah for direct mailing\n\n$12,259 to E Design Company of Grand Rapids for yard signs\n\nSome of the largest expenditures by Holmes' campaign as listed on the FEC website:\n\nNine payments totaling $16,989 to NPG VAN of Washington, D.C. for website design, support and software\n\nFive payments totaling $11,636 to Walter H. Zinn Jr. of Jackson, Mississippi for consulting fee and expenses\n\nTwo payments totaling $5,000 to Amber McAndrews of Mount Pleasant for consulting fees\n\nTwo payments totaling $3,232 to Sawicki & Son of Detroit for yard signs\n\nLibertarian candidate William Tyler White of Bath and U.S. Taxpayers Party candidate George M. Zimmer of Byron are also running for the District 4 seat.\n\nNeither White nor Zimmer have submitted financial reports to the Federal Elections Commission. Candidates are only required to file with the FEC after they raise or spend $5,000 or more.\n\nIn terms of total fundraising, the gap between Moolenaar and Holmes is nearly as large as the spending gap.\n\nMoolenaar's campaign is funded entirely through donations, which come to a total of $973,458. Holmes' fundraising efforts brought in $80,291 and to supplement his budget, Holmes' took a $25,550 loan from himself for the campaign.\n\nMoolenaar received individual contributions from familiar names in the Great Lakes Bay Region. Many of the contributors listed their employer as Dow Chemical Co., where Moolenaar formerly worked as a chemist.\n\nA look at notable contributions to Moolenaar's campaign:\n\nAndrew Liveris, Dow Chemical Co.
