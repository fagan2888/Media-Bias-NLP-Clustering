But never mind. In any case, the CBS report goes on to cite electromagnetic hypersensivity \"researcher\" David Carpenter. From CBS:\n\nDr. David Carpenter, an Environmental Scientist and expert on wi-fi\u2019s effects said the scientific link between wi-fi and health is clearly emerging. \u201cThere is a body of evidence that is strong. it\u2019s not 100 percent understood, but it\u2019s strong evidence that this is a real syndrome that causes real harm to real people,\u201d he said. Dr. Carpenter said it\u2019s a significant problem for about 5 percent of the population, many of them have no idea that wi-fi is to blame. \u201cThey walk around feeling ill and they don\u2019t know what to do about it,\u201d he said. Other doctors counter that the evidence connecting wi-fi to illness just isn\u2019t there. \u201cIt\u2019s a psychological phenomenon,\u201d neuropsychologist Dr. William Barr said. Dr. Barr said some people may have symptoms, but what causes them is something else altogether. He said the power of suggestion may play a role.\n\nPower of suggestion? Well, yes. For example, this 2013 study in the Journal of Psychosomatic Research reports the amusing results of an experiment in which 150 subjects listened to a TV story about the adverse health effects of wifi. The researchers then \"exposed\" the subjects to a sham wifi signal for 15 minutes. More than half the subjects then reported symptoms that they attributed to the sham exposure. The higher participants scored on a psychological anxiety scale, the more likely they were to report symptoms. The researchers conclude:\n\nMedia reports about the adverse effects of supposedly hazardous substances can increase the likelihood of experiencing symptoms following sham exposure and developing an apparent sensitivity to it. Greater engagement between journalists and scientists is required to counter these negative effects.\n\nThanks a lot Drudge and CBS! Shame on you for scaremongering for clicks!\n\nBy the way, it's trivially easy to find non-activist information. For example, based on a review of the scientific literature, the World Health Organization states:\n\nConsidering the very low exposure levels and research results collected to date, there is no convincing scientific evidence that the weak RF signals from base stations and wireless networks cause adverse health effects.\n\nNo convincing evidence.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Top story at Drudge is CBS article promoting discredited activist claims about electromagnetic hypersensitivity.", "title": "Clickbaiting Misinformation: Your Wifi Will Kill You - NOT", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2015/05/21/clickbaiting-misinformation-your-wifi-wi", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14322224595102.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@reason", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14322224595102.jpg", "description": "The New York CBS affiliate is running a story about a woman who hooked up wifi in her apartment and began to have headaches, body flushing, and \"brain fog.\" The story is unfortunately at the top of the Drudge Report today.\nThe first questions might be why did she wait until 2015 to set up wifi and why has she never apparently experienced symptoms while sipping lattes at Starbucks?
