It would not have been good for business.\n\nThat was never on display more clearly than in one of his final shows, where he aired a Fox News segment where media critics discussed the news Stewart had met privately with Obama at the White House on two occasions. The story, of course, furthered the idea that the lefty comic was more interested in helping out the administration than being fully committed to laughs, targets\u2019 political persuasions be damned.\n\nStewart challenged that the Fox hosts had not produced any video evidence of such devotion and played his own montage of Fox showing \u201ceven Stewart\u201d going after the White House for various failings over the previous six years. Boom! Got \u2019em!\n\nOf course, that was precisely the point: Stewart was such a Democratic boot-licker that when even the Obama administration had messed up enough to merit his ridicule, it was newsworthy.\n\nStewart\u2019s version of events wouldn\u2019t really tell the story of the show, so I took his challenge, going back and digging out just a few clips (from the past two years! that told a much more accurate story of The Daily Show and why it merited fond farewell tweets from both the White House and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, not to mention countless left-wing journalists and politicians who loved it for shredding conservatives with a guffawing, adoring studio audience shrieking with delight at every Stewart quip and stare.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been a great gift to the country.\u201d \u2014President Obama to Jon Stewart on @TheDailyShow #JonVoyage pic.twitter.com/ku6QZx2nE1 \u2014 Barack Obama (@BarackObama) August 6, 2015\n\nJon Stewart\u2019s last day on @TheDailyShow is the end of an era. Thank you, Jon. #jonvoyage pic.twitter.com/mWURTnLvfp \u2014 DCCC (@dccc) August 6, 2015\n\nOn Obamacare, the border crisis, Hobby Lobby, the Iran nuclear deal and so many other issues that came to light, Stewart, always looked to by the press for his reaction to the stories of the day, consistently sided with power.\n\nA classic example: After Obama told Fox News host Bill O\u2019Reilly that \u201cyour and your TV station\u201d promote phony scandals about his administration in February 2014, Stewart did the \u201csprinkler\u201d dance move to celebrate.\n\n\u201cQuite an accusation!\u201d Stewart yelled. \u201cThat Fox News unfairly promotes\u2013and in some cases creates\u2013scandals for the sole purpose of undermining this president, although, in Obama\u2019s defense, it is true.\u201d\n\nStewart certainly did not pretend to not be liberal. While he rose to prominence as a progressive oasis during the Bush administration (more than a few cultural writers have sworn his comedy show helped them \u201csurvive\u201d 2001 to 2009), when Obama came to the White House, Stewart\u2019s targets shifted from the conservatives once in power to conservatives bashing the ones in power.\n\nHis style was once described thusly by National Review\u2018s Kevin Williamson:\n\nMr. Stewart is among the lowest forms of intellectual parasite in the political universe, with no particular insights or interesting ideas of his own, reliant upon the very broadest and least clever sort of humor, using ancient editing techniques to make clumsy or silly political statements sound worse than they are and then pantomiming outrage at the results.\n\nThe media, though a frequent subject of his humorous scorn, still praised him because Stewart said and targeted the Right things. When he announced he was leaving back in February, the mourning across ABC, CBS, NBC, MSNBC and CNN was hilariously telling.\n\nThat Stewart occasionally offered criticism of the Obama White House was no indicator that he wanted to hold all politicians accountable. His publicized takedowns of the Obamacare website\u2019s malfunctioning had more to do with his disappointment that a liberal program was at risk because of faulty installation. One writer noted this was right out of his playbook: \u201cmocking liberals\u2019 tactics and implementation but not their underlying assumptions or ideas.\u201d\n\nRather, Stewart\u2019s schtick was pretty repetitive: Cheaply edited clips of Fox News personalities or Republican politicians saying the same thing over and over to make them appear moronic, Stewart mugging for the audience or screeching some obscenity, and dutiful outlets reporting the next day that Stewart had in fact obliterated his chosen target.\n\nIt certainly made liberals feel good about themselves, as evidence by testimonials broadcast here and written here and here and here and here and here.\n\nIn his final interview with Stewart, Obama told the audience, \u201dI\u2019m issuing a new executive order: That Jon Stewart cannot leave the show.\u201d\n\nThe crowd roared.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Before Jon Stewart bowed out of The Daily Show, he had an interview with President Obama.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "Before Jon Stewart bowed out as host of The Daily Show, he had one more interview with President Obama in July, in which\u00a0CBS described them as \u201ctwo old friends\u201d on the verge of leaving their resp", "title": "Jon Stewart Wanted Video Evidence That He Was an Obama Propagandist So We Found A Bunch", "url": "http://freebeacon.com/culture/jon-stewart-wanted-video-evidence-that-he-was-an-obama-propagandist-so-we-found-a-bunch/", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/freebeacon.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Before Jon Stewart bowed out as host of The Daily Show, he had one more interview with President Oba", "creator": "@DavidRutz", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/freebeacon.png", "title": "Jon Stewart Wanted Video Evidence That He Was an Obama Propagandist So We Found A Bunch", "site": "@freebeacon", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1047859882", "fb": {"app_id": "FB_APP_ID", "pages": 282024895179874}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "In his final interview with Stewart, Obama told the audience, \u201dI\u2019m issuing a new executive order: That Jon Stewart cannot leave the show.\u201dThe crowd roared.\nThat Stewart occasionally offered criticism of the Obama White House was no indicator that he wanted to hold all politicians accountable.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been a great gift to the country.\u201d \u2014President Obama to Jon Stewart on @TheDailyShow #JonVoyage pic.twitter.com/ku6QZx2nE1 \u2014 Barack Obama (@BarackObama) August 6, 2015Jon Stewart\u2019s last day on @TheDailyShow is the end of an era.\nOf course, that was precisely the point: Stewart was such a Democratic boot-licker that when even the Obama administration had messed up enough to merit his ridicule, it was newsworthy.\nStewart challenged that the Fox hosts had not produced any video evidence of such devotion and played his own montage of Fox showing \u201ceven Stewart\u201d going after the White House for various failings over the previous six years."}
