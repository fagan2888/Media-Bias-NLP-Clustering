Sioux Falls, SD

It's not uncommon to run to a grocery store for fresh fruit or a gallon of milk. But now customers can also get a check-up and health information while they're at one regional grocery chain.

Pulled up in front of Hy-Vee on Minnesota Avenue is a mini health clinic on wheels Friday.

"We've kind of taken the attitude that, if we build it, they will come," Dr. David Basil said.

It's called the Hy-Vee Health You Mobile Powered by Avera, created through a partnership between the grocer and the hospital.

The mobile unit is outfitted with two exam rooms providing health information and screenings. Dietitians and pharmacists will staff the vehicle providing health services to areas with limited health options.

"Life is busy. You don't always have the time to get to the physican's office for an annual checkup or anything. That will be wonderful if we did. But we live in the real world," Basil said.

Patients can also the opportunity for a virtual visit with a provider, at a cost of less than $50, through the Avera Now app.

"In a consumer world, we truly have to be where the consumers are," Dr. Preston Renshaw, Avera's Chief Medical Officer, said, "We have to make it easy and accessible for them because if it's not accessible, people just don't go do it. They don't have time."

That's only the start of Hy-Vee's and Avera's push for health care accessibility.

Convenience clinics and kiosks will be built inside four Sioux Falls stores beginning this fall where customers can bring health concerns to providers though a virtual visit.

Organizers in charge of the partnership say when it's the easier for patients to find care, the healthier they will be.

"Early access to preventative health screenings saves people's lives," Renshaw said.

In all, eight sponsored mobile units will be added throughout the region over the next three years.
