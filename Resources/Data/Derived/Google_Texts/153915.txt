The Baton Rouge Area Foundation announced this morning it has brought in several hundred thousand dollars so far in its effort to raise $2.9 million to help the state Department of Health and Hospitals administer Louisiana’s Medicaid program.

BRAF is accepting the donations from businesses and organizations, and will send the money to DHH, who will in turn use the money to make sure Medicaid is administered smoothly, and eligibility screenings are done quickly, BRAF spokesperson Mukul Verma says in a news release.

Verma says DHH approached BRAF about opening the fund, and BRAF agreed to help. BRAF President and CEO John Davies says in a statement that the sooner the money is raised, the sooner DHH can use it to enhance its administrative capabilities.

“Individuals eligible for Medicaid who miss out on receiving coverage rely on emergency departments as their sole source of care, a situation that is more expensive for both hospitals and the state, and which also provides poorer overall health outcomes when compared to the primary and preventive care provided by Medicaid,” he says.

The money will also be used to help DHH add capacity for the enrollment of additional eligible patients following the July 1 expansion of Medicaid in the state under the Affordable Care Act, as outlined in an executive order by Gov. John Bel Edwards.

Verma says BRAF will raise as much money as DHH needs for the administrative costs, adding the number is currently pegged at $2.9 million.
