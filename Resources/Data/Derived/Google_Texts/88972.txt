YouTube Shuts Down Investigative Reporter Sharyl Attkisson's 'Full Measure' Channel. UPDATED: She's Back On

YouTube has shut down former CBS reporter Sharyl Attkisson's new Full Measure News channel, effective last night, and now she is asking why.

All we did was post our @FullMeasureNews programs. @YouTube suspended entire account, now. Help us ask @YouTube why. pic.twitter.com/b1BZf0qBpQ — Sharyl Attkisson (@SharylAttkisson) December 15, 2015

The hard-hitting investigative journalist recently launched Full Measure News, "a broadcast focusing on investigative, original and accountability reporting."

While at CBS, Attkisson became known for breaking stories on various Obama administration scandals and disasters, including the "Fast and Furious" gun-running scheme into Mexico, the attack on American diplomatic stations in Benghazi, and the ongoing collapse of Obamacare -- and for generally getting under the president's notoriously thin skin.

In a post about YouTube's arbitrary censorship at sharylattkisson.com, she writes, "our goal is to provide information that others may not want you to see. #MissionAccomplished"

Full Measure: the only national investigative news program banned by YouTube.

You can still watch the video reports at FullMeasure.News.

UPDATE: She's back on You Tube.

Good News: Google indicates our @ YouTube @ FullMeasure channel was taken down in error and is back up. Check it out. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCBQvusXIl4 …

"In error." Right...
