(KWQC) \u2013 When you check into a hospital for surgery, you\u2019re placing your life into another person\u2019s hands. You trust that they\u2019re taking every precaution to keep you safe. But hospital memos and state inspection reports dug up by TV-6 show a number of mistakes occurred in recent months at Genesis hospitals \u2013 mistakes medical experts say should never happen. Four times in 40 days last year, surgeons at Genesis Health System mistakenly operated on the wrong side of patients.\n\nWrong site surgeries are part of a group of medical mistakes called never events; that means they\u2019re never supposed to happen. In a letter obtained by TV-6 Investigates, Genesis Health System wrote to its employees that four wrong site surgeries had occurred within 40 days, and that practitioners didn\u2019t always follow the hospital procedures meant to protect patients. TV-6 Investigates asked to speak with both the CEO and the Chief Medical Officer to find out what happened and what the system was doing to prevent it in the future. Genesis had us talk to its Vice President of Corporate Communications, Ken Croken.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe severity of the error is critical to understand, in the case of these four errors, no serious consequence reached the patient, relatively speaking,\u201d Croken told KWQC.\n\nHe said no one died, and no one had the wrong limb amputated. The Iowa Department of Inspections and Appeals found two wrong-site surgeries occurred at Genesis hospitals within two weeks. On October 23, a surgeon at Genesis West cut into the left hip of an 80-year-old patient. The patient needed surgery on a broken right hip.\n\n\u201cThe surgeon began the initial incision, no muscle no bone, that would position the surgery to go forward,\u201d said Croken.\n\nThe inspector found no written evidence that a key safety procedure, called a time out, had been performed. A time out is when the operating team double checks the patient, the procedure, and the site before cutting. The surgeon said he didn\u2019t participate in a time out, and didn\u2019t remember if the team did either. A nurse said she did a time out, but didn\u2019t write it down. Croken said there\u2019s no proof a time out didn\u2019t occur.\n\n\u201cThe nurse noted there had been a time out but clearly it had not been an effective time out, because if it had been effective it would not have happened,\u201d said Croken.\n\nThe nurse stopped the surgery and the team figured out the mistake. The surgeon closed the cut, and did the surgery on the correct side.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s no doubt that every person would conclude that more attention should have been paid, to are we on the right side,\u201d said Croken.\n\nOn November 5, a patient came in to Genesis East for thyroid surgery. They had a suspicious mass on the right half and were supposed to have the right half removed. But the doctor mistakenly ordered the left half removed. Nobody caught the error until after the surgery was done.\n\n\u201cThe surgeon removed the side suggested it should be removed, but when the physician got into the surgery, he became suspicious, went back to the original pathology report and determined that it was the other side,\u201d said Croken.\n\nThe surgical team reopened the patient\u2019s neck, and removed the rest of the patient\u2019s thyroid. That half turned out to be cancerous. Standard procedure would have called for the entire thyroid\u2019s removal when that part was found to be cancerous.\n\n\u201cWe take very seriously there had been a miscommunication, that occurred outside our four walls and had been brought inside, but in this case that patient avoided a second surgery,\u201d Croken told TV-6.\n\nCroken told us he didn\u2019t have details on the remaining two wrong site surgeries Genesis discussed in its letter, but said, \u201cThey were also not serious safety events in that no lasting or serious harm occurred to the patient.\u201d\n\nSo what happened? In its letter to staff, Genesis found doctors were not fully participating in time outs. At times there were distractions such as music playing in the background and that markings on a patient were covered up. Croken said staff members involved in a wrong site surgery are going through a disciplinary process.\n\n\u201cI can assure you and the public that we take these time outs very seriously and privileges to work in this hospital are determined by compliance with our safety regulations,\u201d said Croken.\n\nThe Iowa inspector also found Genesis failed to immediately implement a system to ensure time outs occurred after these wrong-site surgeries at Genesis East and West. The state called it an immediate jeopardy. It meant patients were at risk.\n\n\n\nTV-6 investigator Mark Stevens asked Croken, \u201cWhy wasn\u2019t it addressed before a state survey agency ever got involved?\u201d\n\nThe response from Croken \u2013 \u201cIt was addressed which is how we came up with the plan, we reported it to the state survey team, during their visit, but that doesn\u2019t suggest that we didn\u2019t react immediately.\u201d\n\nPatient safety expert Dr. David Nash told KWQC, \u201cA four in a one-month or two-month period is completely unacceptable.\u201d\n\nNash is the editor in chief of the Journal of American Medical Quality. He says modern medicine has worked to eliminate wrong site surgeries for decades. A 2013 study estimates wrong site surgeries occur as often as 50 times a week across the country. Nash says it only takes simple errors to accumulate for a wrong-site surgery to occur.\n\n\u201cVery busy surgeon, very busy operating room, some change in standard procedures of the day, and lo and behold, we get what\u2019s called the Swiss Cheese effect, an error occurs that could in fact lead to wrong site surgery,\u201d said Nash.\n\nThere are multiple reasons wrong site surgeries happen. Researchers studying them in Colorado blamed poor planning and not following the time out. Nash says it boils down to a hospital\u2019s patient safety culture.\n\n\u201cIn a culture that is a just culture that recognizes human fallibility that questions each other in a professional and appropriate manner, there should be zero wrong-site surgeries,\u201d said Nash.\n\n\u201cWe do audits, we self audit ourselves, all the time,\u201d said Center for Health Ambulatory Surgery Center CEO Tom Feldman.\n\nStaff at his Peoria-based surgery center participated in a Joint Commission study a year and a half ago. The goal: figure out more ways to prevent wrong site surgery.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to just refocus and get with a couple true patient identifiers a name a date a of birth, restate the procedure, and then go forward,\u201d said Feldman.\n\nOne process Feldman\u2019s surgery center found could lead to errors were doctors marking their patient\u2019s slightly differently. Some used a dot, some their initials, some a \u201cyes.\u201d With 85 doctors doing surgery, Feldman decided to set a standard. Everyone must use their initials \u2013 period.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s helped draw attention to how important the marking really is,\u201d said Feldman.\n\nThe study also found the center\u2019s time out had grown too complicated. So they simplified it to the three steps we saw. Feldman says he\u2019s glad they took part in the study. Overall, the Joint Commission found the eight medical facilities that participated cut their risks of wrong site surgery in half. The Joint Commission created a tool for hospitals to use to cut their risks too.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s everything from the surgeon\u2019s office, to when it hits our scheduling, to when it comes in here and the patient is prepped for surgery and then ultimately when a surgeon goes to make a cut or begin the surgery,\u201d said Feldman.\n\nGenesis submitted a plan of corrections to regulators addressing the problems the inspector found.\n\nVP of Corporate Communications Ken Croken said, \u201cWe have done so and they have agreed that our plan is effective.\u201d\n\nFixes include the following: everyone must participate in a time out; a patient\u2019s skin marking must be visible; and, time outs will be audited in person.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s our philosophy here and again it has earned us national recognition, safety is the most important of all of our objectives,\u201d said Croken.\n\nInspectors conducted a follow-up inspection at Genesis in early February. They found Genesis was back in compliance with federal regulations. Had they found otherwise, Genesis would have been terminated from participating in the Medicare program.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "When you check into a hospital for surgery, you're placing your life into another person's hands.
