NEW YORK (MainStreet) — Dave Gerboth finds it strange that his favorite place to socialize these days is at a vape shop. The 43-year-old has been smoking two packs of cigarettes a day for more than twenty years, but just five months ago he started the process of quitting with a $200 vaporizer that he purchased at a vape shop in Cape Coral, Fla.

“I never imagined such a shop would pop up and that I would hang out there,” Gerboth told MainStreet. “It’s like having coffee or going to happy hour to hang out with friends.”

Gerboth is among the 90% of cigarette smokers trying to quit who are vaping, according to Vaporin Inc. data.

"It’s a movement,” said Scott Frohman, CEO with Vaporin. “Society looks down on smoking cigarettes but vaping is an acceptable alternative.”

The retail vape store segment has grown to a $1 billion market, according to Wells Fargo data, and Frohman is jumping on the bandwagon with Vaporin’s recent purchase of four vape stores in the Cape Coral and Fort Myers, Fla. enclave.

“We can open these stores for $50,000 to $75,000 and have them cash flow quickly with great margins,” said Frohman, who paid $1 million in cash and $2 million in stock for thevapestoreonline.com chain, which he discovered at a vaporizer trade show this year.
