Unlike their predecessor at the museum, the business hasn\u2019t been satisfied with using a filter to remove the minerals from the university water.\n\nThey\u2019ve been bringing water up the hill from their main location on Geist Road, although they are considering installing a purification system at the new location, said general manager Sarah Posma.\n\nPickiness about water is just one of many ways that Alaska Coffee Roasting Co. is particular about its coffee. As the name suggests, the business roasts its own coffee.\n\nIt also sells roasted beans at the Geist Road store and at the Fairbanks Sam\u2019s Club. But there are no plans to get into the wholesale coffee line more seriously.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really about being vertically integrated and quality centric. We don\u2019t have the structure that Kaladi Brothers (in Anchorage) does where they wholesale to a whole lot of cafes,\u201d Posma said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to do that. We want to make sure we have control of the product and make sure it\u2019s represented properly.\u201d\n\nCoffee roasting businesses weren\u2019t nearly as common in Fairbanks in 1993, when Michael Gesser founded Alaska Coffee Roasting Co. down the street from its current home on Geist Road.\n\nGesser is from New York and came to Fairbanks during the pipeline boom.\n\nHe still owns the business, but he is often in Europe traveling with Alexander Rossi, a Formula One race car driver the company sponsors, Posma said.\n\nAlaska Coffee Roasting Co. is popular with students at nearby West Valley High School. Posma, one such student, started working as a barista after graduating and was promoted to general manager in 2008.\n\nIn her experience, Fairbanksans\u2019 taste for coffee has improved in recent years.\n\n\u201cPeople are embracing more of the coffee drinks rather than the milk and sugar drinks,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to see that people really appreciate a black coffee or an Americano and are steering less towards the white chocolate mochas with extra caramel and whipped cream.\u201d\n\nHer own tastes have followed a similar progression.\n\nAs a student her favorite drink was a raspberry mocha. She now drinks pure espresso.\n\nThe business buys its coffee from distributor Royal Coffee in California. One of their most popular coffees is usually Ethiopian Yergoshef, a coffee from a mountainous region in the Horn of Africa where coffee once grew wild and is now cultivated.\n\nThe expansion on the university campus isn\u2019t the first for ACRC. In 2011, the business expanded in a different direction, to North Miami, Florida.\n\nThat branch was opened by Gesser\u2019s sister who lives in Florida, and with a few climate-related adjustments to the menu, the store is almost identical to the Geist Road location.\n\nFloridians like the Alaska-owned business although they\u2019re sometimes puzzled by the business\u2019 tropical location, Posma said. Occasional vacationing Fairbanksans stop by the Miami location for a taste of home.\n\nThe new Museum of the North location has been popular so far, although it\u2019s been getting slower at the museum as tourism season winds down, she said.\n\nThe business hopes to make the museum a popular study spot for students.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Fairbanks (Alaska) Daily News-Miner, http://www.newsminer.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Water is an important coffee ingredient, which is why Alaska Coffee Roasting Co. is trucking water to its new coffee stand location inside the Museum of the North.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Water is an important coffee ingredient, which is why Alaska Coffee Roasting Co. is trucking water to its new coffee stand location inside the Museum of the North.", "title": "Fairbanks roaster serves up coffee brews", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/sep/14/fairbanks-roaster-serves-up-coffee-brews/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/09/14/8ff8d8f0ed3786235f0f6a70670051da.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/09/14/8ff8d8f0ed3786235f0f6a70670051da.jpg", "description": "Water is an important coffee ingredient, which is why Alaska Coffee Roasting Co. is trucking water to its new coffee stand location inside the Museum of the North.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Fairbanks roaster serves up coffee brews"}, "Author": "SAM FRIEDMAN", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd96d9\"", "article_summary": "Pickiness about water is just one of many ways that Alaska Coffee Roasting Co. is particular about its coffee.\nFAIRBANKS, Alaska (AP) - Water is an important coffee ingredient, which is why Alaska Coffee Roasting Co. is trucking water to its new coffee stand location inside the Museum of the North.\nThe coffee house began operating a coffee stand July 1 inside the University of Alaska museum.\nAlaska Coffee Roasting Co. is popular with students at nearby West Valley High School.\n___Information from: Fairbanks (Alaska) Daily News-Miner, http://www.newsminer.com"}
