Democrats and Republicans are at each other\u2019s throats, both sides blaming the other for the shutdown and the problems preceeding it. Terms such as \u201cAffordable Care Act,\u201d \u201cfederal debt ceiling\u201d and \u201clong term budget deal\u201d are being thrown around, but the question as to what these phrases really mean remains unanswered. It seems that most Americans quickly develop opinions on national issues like the government shutdown and each person fights to voice his or her own opinion. The government shutdown is definitely a problem that needs to be addressed, but Americans need to become well-informed on the issue at hand before bashing the other side or even offering their own opinion. Both biased media and social media are hindrances in informing Americans of the true reasoning behind the government shutdown. Most news outlets offer biased information on all issues, especially those regarding the government. Trying to find an unbiased position on the government shutdown definitely proves to be a challenge, however it is a necessary step to take before developing opinions on the matter. Hearing all sides of the story not only better informs one in choosing a side, but also helps Americans to better understand the opposing side and provide better informed arguments.\n\nSocial media has also escalated, confused, pushed and stoked the debate regarding the government shutdown. Uninformed critics listen to biased media or friends, form opinions based on these \u201cfacts\u201d and post infuriated messages on Facebook and Twitter, evoking uproars from friends and family.\n\nIn addition, other individuals wishing to understand the reason- ing behind the government shutdown read these posts, develop their own opinions and write their own posts.\n\nThe vicious cycle continues until the truth becomes so utterly diluted that no one comes close to true understanding.\n\nCharacter limits cause problems, too. No one can explain the reasoning behind the government shutdown in 140 characters on Twitter. In this regard, social me- dia has hindered Americans\u2019 understanding of national issues.\n\nDeveloping opinions on nationwide problems such as the shutdown of the U.S. government is vital to those living in the American republic. Individuals must become well-informed by listening to all sides of an issue and take caution regarding social media.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9593\"", "article_summary": "Individuals must become well-informed by listening to all sides of an issue and take caution regarding social media.\nBoth biased media and social media are hindrances in informing Americans of the true reasoning behind the government shutdown.\nSocial media has also escalated, confused, pushed and stoked the debate regarding the government shutdown.\nDemocrats and Republicans are at each other\u2019s throats, both sides blaming the other for the shutdown and the problems preceeding it.\nUninformed critics listen to biased media or friends, form opinions based on these \u201cfacts\u201d and post infuriated messages on Facebook and Twitter, evoking uproars from friends and family."}
