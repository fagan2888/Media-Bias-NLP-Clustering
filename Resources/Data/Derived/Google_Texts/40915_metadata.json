But it\u2019s not without its perils \u2013 Sen. Marco Rubio\u2019s reach for a bottle of water during his 2013 speech or comparisons of Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal to \u201c30 Rock\u201d character Kenneth the Page \u2013 can detract from the message and backfire on the messenger.\n\n( PHOTOS: Scenes from State of the Union 2013)\n\nBoehner and McConnell make the choice together, and \u201cthere\u2019s no magic formula,\u201d Boehner spokesman Brendan Buck said. \u201cWe always seek someone who can effectively communicate our solutions, priorities, and the principles we stand for. And we\u2019re lucky to have a lot of talented people to choose from.\u201d\n\nTea Party Express, meanwhile, has made it\u2019s choice. Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) will speak after the official GOP response.\n\nThe leaders could choose to pull a Dick Cheney and choose themselves to deliver the response, but assuming they look outside their small circle, here are 10 possibilities, and the pros and cons for each getting the job:\n\n1) Scott Walker\n\nPro: The Wisconsin governor has the name recognition and ambitions that would make him a logical choice to respond to the president. He hasn\u2019t been shy about rebutting Democrats\u2019 positions on unemployment insurance and the minimum wage, arguing that the White House\u2019s latest push on income inequality is an effort to distract from problems with the Affordable Care Act. He could also cite his state\u2019s requirement that unemployed people without children must be engaged in a job training program to receive benefits and suggest that the same be required in other states or nationally.\n\n( PHOTOS: Republicans, 2016 contenders)\n\nCon: Will the base like it? Walker\u2019s popular on the economic front, but has avoided talking about the red meat social issues that appeal to Republican voters.\n\n2) Paul Ryan\n\nPro: Ryan, the House Budget Committee chairman and 2012 Republican vice presidential candidate, could tout the bipartisan budget deal reached last month with Senate Budget Chairman Patty Murray (D-Wash.) as a signal the GOP is willing to reach across the aisle and break the image of Congress as hopelessly deadlocked.\n\n( PHOTOS: Paul Ryan through the years)\n\nCon: Ryan is still remembered as the No. 2 on the losing Mitt Romney ticket. Plus, he gave the GOP response to the SOTU just three years ago.\n\n3) Ted Cruz\n\nPro: The Texas freshman senator isn\u2019t a favorite of the party establishment has been one of the most visible national Republicans over the past year, especially for his opposition to the Affordable Care Act. He captured headlines in September with his 21-hour anti-Obamacare speech on the Senate floor, and was widely credited (and attacked) as the person most responsible for the GOP\u2019s defund-or-shut down strategy on the health care law, which in part led to a 16-day government shutdown.\n\nCon: The shutdown was a disaster, Obamacare still exists and Cruz had to defend himself against angry fellow Republicans in closed-door meetings last fall.\n\n( QUIZ: Do you know Ted Cruz?)\n\n4) John Cornyn\n\nPro: Cruz\u2019s fellow Texas senator, Cornyn, the minority whip, who would speak on behalf of the conservative \u2013 though not extreme \u2013 members of the GOP. Like McConnell in Kentucky, Cornyn and opposed Cruz\u2019s approach to Obamacare and the government shutdown, and faces a primary challenge from the right.\n\n( PHOTOS: The GOP's 2014 SOTU options)\n\nCon: Cornyn doesn\u2019t have the same star power as others on this list and isn\u2019t linked to any national campaign.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "From Ted Cruz to Mia Love, take a look who could offer a rebuttal to the president.", "title": "Who could give the SOTU response", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/01/state-of-the-union-2014-republican-response-102388.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/01/20/140120_gop_sotu_response_ap_605.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Barack Obama,State Of The Union 2014,Republicans,Scott Walker,Nikki Haley,Chris Christie,Mia Love,Paul Ryan", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "From Ted Cruz to Mia Love, take a look who could offer a rebuttal to the president.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcb9b\"", "article_summary": "The State of the Union response is not without its political perils.\nSen.
