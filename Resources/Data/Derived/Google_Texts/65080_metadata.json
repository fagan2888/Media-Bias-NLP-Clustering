Can he recover?\n\nFor Richard M. Nixon, it was \u201cI am not a crook,\u201d for George H. W. Bush it was \u201cRead my lips: no new taxes\u201d and for Bill Clinton it was \u201cI did not have sexual relations with that woman.\u201d\n\nBig presidential lies take many forms. What they all share is the potential to sever the bond of trust between a president and the people he was elected to serve\u2014and therefore to destroy a presidency.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nAnd while it may lack the intrigue of Watergate or the Monica Lewinsky imbroglio, \u201cIf you like your plan, you can keep it\u201d may very well have a similar effect on Obama: effectively ending his presidency more than three years before it officially concludes.\n\nIn August 1964, Congress passed the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, which authorized President Lyndon B. Johnson to use \u201c all necessary measures\u201d to protect U.S. service members abroad without having to secure a formal declaration of war by the Senate. The resolution was prompted by the Gulf of Tonkin incident, which Johnson described to Congress and the American people as two unprovoked attacks by North Vietnamese warships against U.S. vessels in the Gulf.\n\nOnly it was untrue. Johnson used the incident first to promise the American people that \u201cWe still seek no wider war,\u201d which helped him defeat the hawkish GOP Sen. Barry Goldwater in the 1964 election, then, later, to escalate the war in Vietnam.\n\nIt is often said that Vietnam was LBJ\u2019s undoing. But it was his lies about Vietnam that really did him in. A 1967 Harris poll found that Americans\u2019 most serious criticism of Johnson was that \u201che was not honest about sending troops to Vietnam.\u201d Johnson\u2019s approval ratings never recovered, and he was forced to scale back his ambitious domestic agenda. Ultimately, he reluctantly withdrew from the 1968 presidential race.\n\nAt the 1988 Republican National Convention, George H.W. Bush accepted the Republican nomination for president by emphatically stating, \u201cRead my lips: no new taxes.\u201d The pledge was seen by the Bush campaign as a way to unite the GOP around the moderate candidate. Once in office, Bush ultimately raised taxes at the behest of a Democratic Congress dead set on balancing the budget through tax increases. The backlash was strong. A New York Post headline read: \u201cRead my lips: I lied.\u201d\n\nBush\u2019s popularity plummeted, and Pat Buchanan, who challenged Bush in the 1992 Republican primaries, constantly reminded voters of Bush\u2019s lie, insisting it was proof of Bush\u2019s lack of honesty. Clinton also seized on Bush\u2019s broken promise, producing ads late in the campaign that attacked Bush\u2019s character. Bush\u2019s repeated apologies only made him look weak, and they became fodder for late-night comedy shows. When Bush lost, many political pundits said they believed he would have won had he not raised taxes.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO Magazine", "description": "Opinion: For the first time, most Americans don't trust Obama.
