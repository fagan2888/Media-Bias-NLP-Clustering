Tom Coburn\u2019s latest annual \u201cWastebook\u201d report, which claims the FBI wasted an entire office\u2019s annual budget of $1.5 million and its staff\u2019s time to serve as a consulting firm to movie stars, screen writers and producers by providing advice about how to accurately portray the Bureau on the big screen.\n\nThe report highlights 100 examples of what Coburn\u2019s office deems the most egregious waste of taxpayer dollars hidden in the federal budget. This year, to the FBI\u2019s dismay, the Bureau\u2019s Investigative Publicity and Public Affairs Unit made the Senator\u2019s list.\n\nRelated: Government Blatantly Wasted $30 Billion Last Year\n\nThe unit has worked behind the scenes on hundreds of popular shows like \u201cCriminal Minds\u201d and \u201cCSI\u201d as well as major blockbusters like \u201cShooter\u201d and \u201cBreach.\u201d\n\nThe bureau isn\u2019t taking this accusation lightly, especially since they\u2019ve been hurt by the sequester and other budget cuts. They call the report \u201cmisleading\u201d since it fails to mention that helping Hollywood is only a small part of what the unit actually does.\n\n\u201cAny assistance given to the entertainment industry actually represents a small part of the unit\u2019s responsibilities. We receive a high volume of inquiries from the industry, and, after careful assessment and prioritization - given resource limitations - only a small number can be accommodated,\u201d McKee said.\n\n\u201cWastebook 2013 unfortunately misleads readers about an important function of the FBI,\u201d said Susan McKee, the Unit\u2019s chief. McKee explained that the unit is also responsible for running the Most Wanted Fugitives Program and Most Wanted Terrorists, and the \u201cSeeking Information\u201d tool to assist in identifying and locating crime or terrorism suspects, as well as leading efforts to locate missing children.\n\nMcKee\u2019s office does collaborate with Hollywood producers, from reviewing plots and scripts, to providing b-roll, fact checking, and advice on weapons and props, as the report says. Although the \u201cWastebook\u201d depicts helping Hollywood as unnecessary and wasteful, McKee says it\u2019s \u201cin the public\u2019s best interest\u201d that the Bureau is portrayed accurately on the big screen, \u201cgiven the impact of television and movies on public understanding.\u201d\n\nRelated: Space Agency Targeted for Wasteful Spending\n\nThe report, however, argues that Hollywood producers can already get advice and expertise on how to depict the Bureau from former FBI agents who now have private consulting businesses specifically for that purpose.\n\n\u201cScott Nelson, a retired agent who worked for the FBI for 25 years, for example, \u201cis part of a now-sprawling community of expert \u2018consultants\u2019 who help Hollywood film-makers to realistically portray everything from fight scenes to the intricacies of real- life police investigations,\u201d the report said.\n\n\u201cWhat's troubling is they aren't denying they are using part of their budget to subsidize Hollywood productions. The FBI should be focused on terror plots, not movie plots,\u201d John Hart, a spokesman for Coburn's office said. \u201cEvery dollar we spend helping Jerry Bruckheimer get his facts right is a dollar we can't spend stopping criminals and terrorists.\u201d\n\nTop Reads From The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation has been accused of shooting the wrong targets-- H", "title": "FBI Accused of Working on Movie Plots, Not Terror Plots", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/01/07/FBI-Accused-Working-Movie-Plots-Not-Terror-Plots", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/01072014_Fox_Mulder.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/01/07/FBI-Accused-Working-Movie-Plots-Not-Terror-Plots", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/01072014_Fox_Mulder.png", "creator": "@Briannaehley", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation has been accused of shooting the wrong targets-- H", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb319\"", "article_summary": "The FBI should be focused on terror plots, not movie plots,\u201d John Hart, a spokesman for Coburn's office said.\nMcKee\u2019s office does collaborate with Hollywood producers, from reviewing plots and scripts, to providing b-roll, fact checking, and advice on weapons and props, as the report says.\n\u201cWastebook 2013 unfortunately misleads readers about an important function of the FBI,\u201d said Susan McKee, the Unit\u2019s chief.\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation has been accused of shooting the wrong targets-- Hollywood movies\u2014and in the process wasting millions of taxpayer dollars.\nThe report highlights 100 examples of what Coburn\u2019s office deems the most egregious waste of taxpayer dollars hidden in the federal budget."}
