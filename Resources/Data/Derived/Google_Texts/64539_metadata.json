(To be fair, I've grown up on Earth, too, and there are times that I don't understand any part of this place.)\n\nYou see, years ago, I was diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome - and like a lot of \"Aspies,\" sometimes I'm convinced that I've landed on the wrong planet.\n\nFor those of you who don't know the medical lingo, Asperger's syndrome is an autism spectrum disorder, but not as severe as what most people think of as autism.\n\nIt basically comes down to this: those \"normal human\" rules for things like eye contact, when to smile, personal distance - we just don't get them.\n\nWhat's more, Aspies like me don't like those rules. They make no sense to us. So usually, we just say stuff - bluntly - and stare uncomfortably at the ground. That's how we roll.\n\nBut it gets even trickier for people of faith like me.\n\nFeeling out of place at work is one thing. Feeling like an alien at church is a whole other matter.\n\nImagine Mr. Spock at an evangelical Christian tent revival, and you\u2019ll get the idea.\n\nAnd my father is a pastor, so I was in church a lot.\n\nMultiple times, each week, every week, I found myself wishing I'd be moved by the worship music, or that I could shut off my skeptical mind during the sermons.\n\nI'd see people in church services, Christian concerts and Bible camps overcome by emotion and enraptured with charismatic speakers, and I wondered why I didn't feel that way.\n\nWhy did I always feel like a cold observer?\n\nAfter going to college, I was convinced my lack of feeling meant I was missing something, spiritually, so I joined charismatic Christian groups in which emotional manifestations of the Holy Spirit are common.\n\nI desperately wanted to have what they had - an emotional experience of God's presence - and asked them to pray over me.\n\nIt didn't work.\n\nWhen I didn\u2019t move with the Holy Spirit or speak in tongues, they told me it was because I had rejected God.\n\nI worried that it was the other way around: God had rejected me.\n\nMaybe I felt like an alien because I deserved it. I deserved to be alienated, irretrievably and forever far from God.\n\nI tried to pray, read the Bible, and do all the \"right stuff.\" But I still felt out-of-touch.\n\nI wondered if I was so broken, such a misfit that God simply took a look at me and decided to move on.\n\nI wish I\u2019d known then that I was an Aspie. And that God loves Aspies.\n\nI still feel alienated from many parts of Christian culture, but Jesus himself finally reached me.\n\nAnd man, did I feel that.\n\nTo people who are beaten down or befuddled by religious rules, Jesus offers something that no one else does: rest. \"Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest,\" he says.\n\nAnd he sums up the entirety of complex and confusing religious laws with this: \u201cLove God, and love your neighbor.\u201d\n\nBeautiful. Even children can understand that.\n\nThe Bible tells a story about a man who approaches Jesus and admits that he has faith, but also strong doubts.\n\n\"Help me in my unbelief,\" he asks Jesus.\n\nJesus doesn't blast him. He loves him. To me, Jesus is the only one who really makes any sense.\n\nOddly enough, considering my medical condition, I'm now a radio personality on a network that plays Christian music.\n\nIt\u2019s a beautiful fit, in many ways, because I get to talk to many people who also don\u2019t fit in, and wonder if God loves them.\n\nIt\u2019s true, though, others won\u2019t understand me. I know that. I\u2019m still an alien in the American Christian subculture.\n\nEach evening I retreat from it, and I go straight to the Gospels.\n\nIt's not out of duty that I read about Jesus; it's a respite.\n\nI long for it, because I'm awash in two strange and baffling cultures, both the irreligious and religious.\n\nAnd I long for someone I can finally understand, and someone who might finally understand me.\n\nBrant Hansen is a radio host on the Air1 network, where his show airs from 3-7 p.m. CT.
