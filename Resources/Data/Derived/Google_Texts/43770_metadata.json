Would Biden be a good or a poor presidential candidate?\n\nToo unpredictable\n\nThis is an odd thing to say, but a Joe Biden candidacy might be the closest thing the Democrats could offer to counter Donald Trump.\n\nBiden doesn\u2019t share Trump\u2019s obnoxious, opportunistic, race-driven populism. But he\u2019s similar in that his appeal \u2014 to fans, anyway \u2014 is that he\u2019s, well, unpredictable, and not always beholden to talking points: Biden is the avuncular uncle at Thanksgiving who says what everybody else is thinking. Just like Trump, Biden sometimes offers the thrill of the forbidden.\n\nSometimes this has helped him be a great public servant. But it would probably make him a bad president.\n\nRemember when President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act? It was Biden who grasped the president and \u2014 in the presence of a hot microphone \u2014 proclaimed the moment a \u201cbig (expletive) deal.\u201d He was right!\n\nAnd remember when Biden told the nation that gay marriage should be legal? It was that act that forced President Obama \u2014 who had never before supported gay rights to marriage \u2014 to follow suit several days later in an interview with ABC\u2019s Robin Roberts.\n\nOn the flip side, Biden destroyed his own presidential run \u2014 and aided Obama\u2019s \u2014 in 2008, when he referred to the then-Senator as \u201carticulate and bright and clean,\u201d a racial faux pas that could\u2019ve ended his political career if he weren\u2019t, well, Joe Biden.\n\nThe vice president\u2019s unpredictability, you see, goes both ways: Sometimes it\u2019s a force for good. Sometimes not. But that attribute would be unforgivable in a president, an office that demands a level of self-discipline that Biden \u2014 God bless him \u2014 has never mastered.\n\nIn some ways, that\u2019s great: It means our vice president is human, which is a big part of his appeal. But a president\u2019s loose lips can sink ships \u2014 or at least send stock markets plummeting, or cause diplomatic problems we don\u2019t need.\n\nJoe Biden has served his country honorably, and for a long time. His dignity in the face of his son\u2019s death is an example to us all. But he shouldn\u2019t be president. And he doesn\u2019t need to be: His legacy is already assured.\n\n\u2014 Joel Mathis\n\nAn exquisite foil\n\nJoe Biden would be an exquisite foil, first for the less-than-inevitable Hillary Clinton in pursuit of the Democratic Party\u2019s nomination, and then \u2014 should he be so fortunate \u2014 in a general election fight with just about any Republican. Even Mike Huckabee.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd it was impossible not to be moved by Biden\u2019s reminiscence with Stephen Colbert about his son Beau, who succumbed to brain cancer last year. But paternal love and Irish sentimentality are not qualifications for the presidency. Americans don\u2019t need an affable, gaffe-prone guy in the Oval Office. We need a statesman, or somebody close to one.\n\nThe trouble with Biden is he doesn\u2019t know as much as he thinks and doesn\u2019t think as much as he knows. Journalist Richard Ben Cramer put it best in his account of the 1988 election, \u201cWhat it Takes\u201d: \u201cJoe often didn\u2019t know what he thought until he had to say it.\u201d\n\nThat brings to the time in 2007 when Biden told the late TV newsman Tim Russert, \u201cI have changed my mind, but I haven\u2019t changed my mind in any fundamental way \u2026\u201d about his support for the Iraq War. Like John Kerry in 2004, Biden was for the war before he was against it.\n\nIt\u2019s a basic axiom of our politics: People forget. And people often don\u2019t know.\n\nPeople forget about Biden\u2019s disgraceful slanders against Robert Bork and his \u201chigh-tech lynching\u201d of Clarence Thomas when both were nominated for the Supreme Court. Ancient history? Biden showed then, and many times thereafter, that he was not a man of his word and that he would distort the judicial philosophy of conservative nominees if it suited his agenda.\n\nPeople forget or don\u2019t know about Biden\u2019s lousy judgment. He was alone among President Obama\u2019s advisers in urging the president not to order the 2011 raid that ended with the death of Osama bin Laden.\n\nBiden should run so people remember, so they will know. Let him vindicate his terrible judgment and the follies of the administration he\u2019s served these seven long years. Let him defend the toothless Iran deal. Let him explain why China and Russia are more belligerent after Obama\u2019s two terms. And then let the people decide if affable old Joe deserves to be president.\n\n\u2014 Ben Boychuk\n\nBen Boychuk is associate editor of the Manhattan Institute\u2019s City Journal.
