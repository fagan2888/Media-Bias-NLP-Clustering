The new company is a partnership between Massachusetts-based Tufts Health Plan and Granite Healthcare Network â€“ the parent company for Catholic Medical Center, Concord Hospital, Wentworth-Douglas Hospital, LRGHealthcare, and Southern New Hampshire Health System.

Tufts Health Freedom Plan will begin selling insurance to employers. The company is considering selling in the individual market too, including on the federal healthcare exchange.

"The goal is for Tufts Health Freedom Plan to provide plans and products that are affordable and simpler to use," says Rachel Rowe, executive director of Granite Healthcare Network..

Rowe expects approval from the state in spring, and to hit the market next January.
