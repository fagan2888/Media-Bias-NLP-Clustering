Remember brosurance? Good news: the website behind the campaign, DoYouGotInsurance.com, is back and this time, they're targeting the ladies.

Where to begin?

If the genders in this ad were reversed, it would be slammed by critics as promoting "rape culture" and misogyny. Instead, we're supposed to applaud "Susie" for making a good health choice using the free birth control pills provided by the Affordable Care Act. This is insane. This ad is disrespectful to both men and women, trivializes sexuality, and is in no way an appropriate advertisement.

And for heaven's sake, the grammatically correct word is "have," not "got." Susie has insurance. This is despicable.

Thanks Obamacare!
