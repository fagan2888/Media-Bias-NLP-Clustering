Many Republicans, particularly the conservative wings in both chambers, would like to use the maneuver to attack Obamacare.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nOn Tuesday, McConnell signaled that Obamacare was a likely reconciliation option, but did not make a firm commitment.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re certainly going to consider using budget reconciliation for repealing as much of Obamacare as is reconcilable,\u201d McConnell told reporters Tuesday. \u201cThere\u2019s certain rules that have to be applied to what is reconcilable and that\u2019s in active consideration, as you can imagine.\u201d\n\nMcConnell also did not lay out a time frame. The Senate committee chairmen with oversight of healthcare have said that they have no plans to report reconciliation legislation by the July 24 deadline set out in the budget. But Senate aides say that reconciliation legislation can be brought up at any time and that the deadline, if missed, won\u2019t prevent action in the future.\n\nEven if Republicans use reconciliation to send President Barack Obama a repeal of his signature healthcare law, he\u2019s sure to veto it. And there are enough Democrats in Senate to uphold that veto.\n\nWyoming Sen. John Barrasso, the fourth-ranking Senate Republican who is the point person on health care, also declined to lay out a timeline for how GOP lawmakers will use reconciliation. But he stressed that the \u201cfocus\u201d of reconciliation was to repeal the health care law.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot to do between now and the end of the work period,\u201d Barrasso said. \u201cAnd those things are much more time-sensitive matters, especially transportation \u2014 the fund ends soon, the issue with Iran sanctions that the president reported today. We have 60 days to review that \u2026 so there is quite a lot to do.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Leaders have not made a final decision on how exactly to use the powerful procedural tool.", "title": "McConnell hints at fast-track procedure for Obamacare repeal", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/mitch-mcconnell-fast-track-budget-obamacare-repeal-health-care-120107.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2015/07/14/150714_mitch_mcconnell_ap_1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Congress,Obamacare,John Barrasso,Senate,Health Care,Mitch McConnell,Affordable Care Act", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "Leaders have not made a final decision on how exactly to use the powerful procedural tool.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "McConnell hints at fast-track procedure for Obamacare repealSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Tuesday that the Senate will consider using a fast-track budget procedure to repeal some of Obamacare but declined to say when that may take place.\n\u201cWe\u2019re certainly going to consider using budget reconciliation for repealing as much of Obamacare as is reconcilable,\u201d McConnell told reporters Tuesday.\nStory Continued BelowOn Tuesday, McConnell signaled that Obamacare was a likely reconciliation option, but did not make a firm commitment.\nMany Republicans, particularly the conservative wings in both chambers, would like to use the maneuver to attack Obamacare.\nEven if Republicans use reconciliation to send President Barack Obama a repeal of his signature healthcare law, he\u2019s sure to veto it."}
