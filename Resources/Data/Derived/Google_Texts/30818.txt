"Our Wonderful World", the weekly travel-adventure series hosted by the Estes Valley Library continues this Monday, June 23 at 7 p.m. with international volunteer Rene Moquin leading a presentation titled "Journeys to Africa". The presentation takes place in the theater at National Park Village, next to The Other Side Restaurant and below Country Supermarket at 900 Moraine Avenue. Admission is free and open to all.

Moquin's program will offer photos and insights to tell the story of daily life specifically in the countries of Tanzania and Malawi. Tanzania, located in east Africa on the Indian Ocean, is home to the Maasai tribe as well as Africa's highest point, Mount Kilimanjaro. Moquin will discuss the Maasai and recount a climb of Kilimanjaro. Moquin's subsequent travels to Malawi were part of efforts to install shallow water wells in a predominantly rural and tribal nation that has been called the "Warm Heart of Africa".

Moquin began his international volunteer efforts in 1966 when he joined an organization working with students and refugees in Southeast Asia. Many years later, he became aware of a group raising funds to build a medical clinic to serve Maasai children and families in Tanzania. Moquin joined efforts by raising funds, serving on their board, and ultimately climbing Kilimanjaro twice as part of a fund-raising effort. He has visited over 250 rural communities in East Africa.

The "Our Wonderful World" is presented as a learning and storytelling opportunity that celebrates magnificent destinations near and far. The library offers a special thank-you to the Scott and Katie Webermeier and the staff of National Park Village for their generosity in once again providing this year's event space.
