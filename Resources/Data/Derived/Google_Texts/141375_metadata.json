Using data from blood and urine samples, they looked for markers used to measure the addictive stimulant nicotine and cancer-causing NNK.\n\nThey found the level of cotinine, which is a marker for nicotine exposure, was 0.043 nanograms/milliliter (ng/ml) in nonsmokers, compared to about 180 ng/ml among smokelesstobacco users, about 131 ng/ml among cigarette users and about 184 ng/ml among people who used both smokeless tobacco and cigarettes.\n\nLevels of NNAL, which is a marker for NNK exposure, were about 0.98 micrograms per liter (ug/L) in nonsmokers, compared to 583 ug/L among smokeless tobacco users, about 218 ug/L among cigarette users and about 430 ug/L among people using both smokeless tobacco and cigarettes.\n\n\"The causes of these differences in exposure between cigarette and smokeless tobacco users are not entirely understood,\" write the researchers.\n\nThe lead author, Brian Rostron, was not available for interviews, the FDA said.\n\nGideon St. Helen of the University of California, San Francisco's Division of Clinical Pharmacology told Reuters Health that the new findings don't mean smokeless tobacco is necessarily more harmful than cigarettes.\n\n\"With tobacco smoke, there area lot of chemicals produced during combustion,\" said St. Helen, who wasn't involved with the new research.\n\nHe added that there are also variations in the NNK levels within different smokeless tobaccoproducts.\n\nRecently, the FDA approved the sale of eight new smokeless tobacco products, which are thought to be a less-toxic option for tobacco users (see Reuters story of Nov. 10, 2015 here: http://reut.rs/1I1X4fw).\n\nDorothy Hatsukami, who studies tobacco at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, said research like this is important to educate consumers, evaluate the health of the nation and determine public policy.\n\nFor example, she told Reuters Health, tobacco products can be regulated by the FDA depending on their ingredients.\n\n\"It would seem to me this evidence supports why that would be appropriate,\" said Hatsukami, who wasn't involved with the new study.\n\nSOURCE: http://bit.ly/1MHbiyQ Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers and Prevention, online November 18, 2015.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "smokeless, tobacco, users, exposed, more, nicotine, cancer, causing, chemical", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Patches, gum and inhalers are all alternative tobacco products with equal or higher levels of nicotine and NNK, a cancer-causing chemical.", "title": "Smokeless Tobacco Users Exposed To More Nicotine", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/smokeless-tobacco-users-exposed-more-nicotine-cancer-causing-chemical-362570", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/11/22/smokeless-tobacco.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Patches, gum and inhalers are all alternative tobacco products with equal or higher levels of nicotine and NNK, a cancer-causing chemical.", "title": "Smokeless Tobacco Users Exposed To More Nicotine", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/smokeless-tobacco-users-exposed-more-nicotine-cancer-causing-chemical-362570", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/11/22/smokeless-tobacco.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/11/22/smokeless-tobacco.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Vitality", "published_time": "2015-11-22T15:11:17-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-22T15:11:16-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Patches, gum and inhalers are all alternative tobacco products with equal or higher levels of nicotine and NNK, a cancer-causing chemical."}, "article_summary": "\"The causes of these differences in exposure between cigarette and smokeless tobacco users are not entirely understood,\" write the researchers.\nCompared to cigarette smokers, users of smokeless tobacco are exposed to equal or higher levels of nicotine and NNK, a cancer-causing chemical in tobacco products, according to a study from the U.S. government.\nSmokeless tobacco -
