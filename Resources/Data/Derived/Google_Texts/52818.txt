Judge Jeanine Pirro spent the first five minutes of her show utterly demolishing the politicized indictment of Texas Governor Rick Perry. She is a national treasure. The dicussion with Democrat Joe Trippi that follows shows that even Democrats are appalled. Trippi suspects it will help Perry in his quest for the nomination. I suspect the Democrat game is to help Perry get the nomination and then use this case as a distraction and doubt-creater in the general election. Accusing Mitt Romney of murdering a worker with cancer worked well, after all. The ridiculousness of the charge doesn't matter.
