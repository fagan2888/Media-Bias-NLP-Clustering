Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told audience members at a campaign rally Friday night not to listen to anybody who says “businesses create jobs.”

“Don’t let anybody tell you it’s corporations and businesses that create jobs,” Mrs. Clinton said during her remarks at a Boston rally for Democratic gubernatorial candidate Martha Coakley, Breitbart reported Friday.

“You know that old theory, ‘trickle-down economics,’” she said, “That has been tried, that has failed. It has failed rather spectacularly.”

Mrs. Clinton, the likely 2016 Democratic nominee reminded the audience of her husband, former President Bill Clinton’s economic policies.

“You know, one of the things my husband says when people say ‘Well, what did you bring to Washington,’ he said, ‘Well, I brought arithmetic,’” Mrs. Clinton said to audience laughter.
