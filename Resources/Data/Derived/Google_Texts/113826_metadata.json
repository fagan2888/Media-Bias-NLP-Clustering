The initial considerations should include the projection\u2019s time frame, the level of detail and the stakeholders involved.\n\nThe amount of detail depends on the project, Belt said, with smaller projects requiring less. \u201cIf it\u2019s a major, major expenditure, like should we buy this hospital, it probably needs to be more detailed, because the risk is higher,\u201d she said.\n\n[See also: The logistics of compliance: Two-midnight rule demands process change.]\n\nEnsuring the model can handle the sensitivity analyses that decision makers will want to see is another factor in determining the level of detail. \u201cWhat if your payer mix changes or salary costs increase at a higher level than we thought?\u201d Belt said. \u201cYou need to build the financial model to be sure you can do that sensitivity analysis.\u201d\n\nFinancial models involve \u201ca whole series of assumptions\u201d about such elements as volume, payer mix and salaries, she noted. While a healthcare system may have historical data to work from, Belt said putting together projections for a new line of business, one for which there are no historical data, is more difficult.\n\nThere\u2019s also the possibility a project\u2019s champions will push to use more optimistic assumptions in a model, she warned. \u201cAs an objective party, you can\u2019t necessarily justify those,\u201d Belt said.\n\nOnce the model is complete, it\u2019s time to do a reality check. Belt cited as an example a model that suggests a project could grab 25 percent of market share. \u201cThat\u2019s not an easy thing to do,\u201d she said. \u201cAt the end, you just need to take a step back and make sure that things are reasonable.\u201d\n\nBenchmarking\n\nThe biggest challenge in putting together financial projections for hospitals is the lack of good benchmarking data, said John Bodine, managing director and head of the financial advisory practice at Huron Consulting.\n\n\u201cYou can get benchmarking data for the hospital in total, but it\u2019s real difficult to drill down to the service line or the department level, and that\u2019s really where those decisions need to be made,\u201d Bodine said.\n\nWhile it\u2019s usually possible to track revenue by department, the data on costs is obscured by overhead, he said. \u201cThey\u2019re just dumping [the overhead] down on these departments.\u201d And the way overhead is allocated isn\u2019t consistent from hospital to hospital, which makes benchmarking difficult, Bodine said.\n\n[See also: ACOs can help medical homes succeed.]\n\nHealthcare reform has created more issues when it comes to financial projections. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to estimate the impact of the ACA,\u201d Bodine said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know where the payer mix is going to stabilize.\u201d\n\nThe uncertainty underscores the need for healthcare systems to have contingency plans or build cushions into their projections, he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be in a process where you need to hit every dollar on that forecast in order to continue functioning as a hospital.\u201d\n\nBelt warned against including too much detail in financial presentations to the board. \u201cIf you do that, you lose the board members,\u201d she said.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/building-strong-financial-projections", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/healthcare-financial-protections2.jpg", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "Financial models involve a whole series of assumptions about such elements as volume, payer mix and salaries.
