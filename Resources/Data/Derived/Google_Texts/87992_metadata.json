A Special Enrollment Period was added for those who were \u201cin line\u201d to enroll and those who qualified for an extension for reasons such as changes to marital status, dependents or address. The Department of Health and Human Services recently published a report detailing the demographics of ACA enrollees who enrolled through April 19.\n\nThis is the first in the series of issue briefs by the HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary of Planning and Evaluation that includes self-reported race and ethnicity information. The report also includes data on other characteristics of people who have picked plans and the plans they chose.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at the Affordable Care Act enrollees:\n\n8,019,763: People who have signed up for the Affordable Care Act\n\nPeople who have signed up for the Affordable Care Act 4,301,656: Female enrollees\n\nFemale enrollees 3,633,920 * : Male enrollees\n\n* Male enrollees 2.2 million: Enrollees ages 18-34\n\nEnrollees ages 18-34 1.37 million : Enrollees ages 35-44\n\n: Enrollees ages 35-44 1.81 million: Enrollees ages 45-54\n\nEnrollees ages 45-54 2 million: Enrollees ages 55-64\n\nEnrollees ages 55-64 85 percent: Individuals who qualify for an advance premium tax credit with or without a cost-sharing reduction\n\nIndividuals who qualify for an advance premium tax credit with or without a cost-sharing reduction 8 of 10: Number of people who are eligible for federal financial assistance in paying their premiums. (Family income must be between 100 and 400 percent of the Federal Poverty Level to receive tax credits for premium assistance.)\n\n* 84,187 did not specify a gender.\n\n\n\nAmong those who chose a health plan via the federally facilitated marketplace and indicated their ethnicity, 62 percent (2,360,672 enrollees) identified as white, 16.7 percent (625,934) are African-Americans, 10.7 percent (403,632) are Latino and 7.9 percent (298,515) identify as Asian. Approximately 31 percent of those who enrolled via the FFM did not report race or ethnicity.\n\nApproximately 85 percent of individuals (more than 8 in 10 people) qualify for financial assistance in the form of an advance premium tax credit to help pay their premiums. (Family income must be between 100 and 400 percent of the Federal Poverty Level to receive tax credits for premium assistance.)\n\nOf those who applied through the federally facilitated marketplace, 13 percent indicated that they had health coverage at the time of application. Other sources show higher percentages of enrollees with existing coverage: among them, a Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index poll says half already had health insurance and RAND Corporation estimates 61 percent had coverage. However, only those applicants who apply for financial assistance via the federally facilitated marketplace are required to report about other health coverage.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "picks", "title": "Obamacare Enrollees, By the Numbers", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "More than 8 million people have signed up for Obamacare, with women\r\noutnumbering men.", "title": "Obamacare Enrollees, By the Numbers", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/05/27/obamacare-enrollees-by-the-numbers", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/2d/7b/8d8f75624ecab1fc8cb2239d8032/140527-obamacare-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@USNews", "description": "More than 8 million people have signed up for Obamacare, with women\r\noutnumbering men.", "card": "summary", "title": "Obamacare Enrollees, By the Numbers"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "news", "date_published": "May 27, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Guzel Ganieva,Pulse,Affordable Care Act,health care,picks", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "More than 8 million people have signed up for Obamacare, with women\r\noutnumbering men."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd05ab\"", "article_summary": "Here\u2019s a look at the Affordable Care Act enrollees:8,019,763: People who have signed up for the Affordable Care ActPeople who have signed up for the Affordable Care Act 4,301,656: Female enrolleesFemale enrollees 3,633,920 * : Male enrollees* Male enrollees 2.2 million: Enrollees ages 18-34Enrollees ages 18-34 1.37 million : Enrollees ages 35-44: Enrollees ages 35-44 1.81 million: Enrollees ages 45-54Enrollees ages 45-54 2 million: Enrollees ages 55-64Enrollees ages 55-64 85 percent: Individuals who qualify for an advance premium tax credit with or without a cost-sharing reductionIndividuals who qualify for an advance premium tax credit with or without a cost-sharing reduction 8 of 10: Number of people who are eligible for federal financial assistance in paying their premiums.\nOf those who applied through the federally facilitated marketplace, 13 percent indicated that they had health coverage at the time of application.\nThe Department of Health and Human Services recently published a report detailing the demographics of ACA enrollees who enrolled through April 19.\n(Family income must be between 100 and 400 percent of the Federal Poverty Level to receive tax credits for premium assistance.)\nHowever, only those applicants who apply for financial assistance via the federally facilitated marketplace are required to report about other health coverage."}
