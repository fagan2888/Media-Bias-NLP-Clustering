Some religions are opposed to abortion , such as the Lutheran Church\u2014Missouri Synod, which explains on its website: \"Our church\u2019s explanation of the Small Catechism puts the matter well when it says, \u2018The living but unborn are persons in the sight of God from the time of conception. Since abortion takes a human life, it is not a moral option except to prevent the death of another human, the mother.'\"An article about the lawsuit in the National Catholic Register argued against Mary Doe\u2019s right to get an abortion : \"At the moment of conception, the unborn child has a unique DNA. That's science. Anything else is just propaganda... It seems to me we all knew which side of the abortion debate Satan was rooting for. I just didn't think it would take him this long to find a lawyer.\"", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "abortion restrictions missouri, abortion missouri, missouri abortion laws, satanic church abortion, pro-choice protest, pro-life protest", "description": "Article about satanic temple filing lawsuit over Missouri's abortion restrictions", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Doe and the Temple believe that the abortion restrictions violated the Federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act.\nThe Satanic Temple has raised more than $20,000 for its legal costs through a crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo.\nDoe argued that the requirements violated her religious beliefs, stating that \"As an adherent to the principles of the Satanic Temple...\n10 states require that written materials be given to the woman seeking the abortion with five states requiring information stating that personhood begins at conception.\nAccording to the Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit reproductive health research and policy organization, three states (Missouri, South Dakota, and Utah) require 72-hour waiting periods, while 23 other states require waiting periods from 18 to 48 hours."}
