Now, she is among millions who earn less than the poverty level but can\u2019t get subsidized private insurance.\n\n\u201cI know \u2014 an uninsured health reporter,\u201d she wrote to me last month. \u201cThe joke\u2019s not lost on me.\u201d\n\nFor Missouri public radio reporter Harum Helmy , the Affordable Care Act is more than just a story she covers. It is also a story she\u2019s living.\n\nHelmy, 23, a part-time reporter/producer for KBIA in Columbia, Mo., recently completed her coursework at the University of Missouri. She\u2019s on her first professional job. At the station, she covers Obamacare, among other things. But she doesn\u2019t make much money, and if the law worked as it was intended, she would be covered by Missouri\u2019s Medicaid program beginning Jan. 1.\n\nThat wasn\u2019t meant to be.\n\nAs signed by President Obama, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) would have required every state to expand its Medicaid program for the poor to include adults earning less than 138 percent of the federal poverty level. Those earning more than that, up to four times the poverty level, would qualify for subsidies to purchase health insurance in marketplaces.\n\nBut the Supreme Court ruled last year that states could opt out of the Medicaid expansion without consequence, and Missouri along with 24 other states have done just that. The problem is that the law didn\u2019t include subsidies for people in those states who earn less than the federal poverty level to buy coverage through the exchanges \u2014 they were supposed to be covered under Medicaid.\n\nThat\u2019s the gap in which Helmy sits.\n\nShe earns less than the poverty level ($10 an hour for 20 hours per week) and qualifies neither for Medicaid nor a subsidy. Helmy was born in Texas and is a U.S. citizen, though her parents live in Indonesia. While she attended classes at the university, her parents paid for her health coverage.\n\nAccording to the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan think tank, \u201cIn states that do not expand Medicaid, nearly 5 million poor uninsured adults have incomes above Medicaid eligibility levels but below poverty and may fall into a \u2018coverage gap\u2019 of earning too much to qualify for Medicaid but not enough to qualify for Marketplace premium tax credits.\u201d In Missouri, 193,000 people, including Helmy, fall into the gap, Kaiser estimates.\n\nOn paper, the Medicaid expansion seems like a great deal. The federal government has agreed to pick up 100 percent of the cost of the expansion for the first three years, phasing down to 90 percent in 2020. But officials in states that have declined to take part view Medicaid as a broken program. They don\u2019t trust the federal government to keep its funding pledge and do not believe they have adequate state funds to cover their portion.\n\nMissouri Gov. Jay Nixon, a Democrat, wants to expand Medicaid in his state, but the Republican-controlled Legislature won\u2019t go along with it.\n\nHelmy discussed her situation in a podcast in October (around the 12-minute mark). \u201cI would just get a little bit personal here and say I\u2019m one of those people,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m in this weird gap where I need insurance, my employer doesn\u2019t give me insurance, but I don\u2019t make enough to get a subsidy.\u201d\n\nI asked her what it felt like to be affected by the act.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still working out how I feel about being part of the story,\u201d she told me in an email. \u201cI\u2019ve talked about it to potential sources as a way to explain to them why this story is important to me, but I\u2019ve quickly learned that compared to many other Americans in the gap, I\u2019m very privileged, barring any catastrophe. I\u2019m healthy, I have no dependents and barely any debt. I\u2019m overly educated, applying for full-time jobs and looking for additional part-time work in the meantime.\u201d\n\nHelmy said she could get a second job, but it\u2019s difficult because she is still working to complete her master\u2019s thesis. \u201cI know that I\u2019m privileged in the sense that I don\u2019t need to get a second job because I don\u2019t have any debt,\u201d she said in a later phone interview.\n\nHelmy said she\u2019s looking for a full-time job and would consider getting a second job so she can get insurance.\n\nShe said that she cares more about the people she covers than about her own situation. \u201cI can see why some anti-ACA people out there think that someone like me wouldn\u2019t need any help,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019m outraged that my sources, people in unimaginably worse shape than me, can\u2019t get help.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: This post is adapted from Ornstein\u2019s \u201cHealthy buzz\u201d blog.
