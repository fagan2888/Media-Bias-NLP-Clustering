Congress is poised to start cranking out legislation to reinstate sanctions or shore up what some lawmakers say is an ill-fated pact with a state supporter of terrorism.\n\nSen. Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has begun a series of hearings on the U.S. role and strategy in the Middle East that will examine the deal\u2019s implications.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to take a while. It\u2019s a very substantive issue,\u201d said Corker, R-Tenn., who opposed the deal. \u201cIt will be a complex piece of legislation.\u201d\n\nConfronted by Democratic opposition, Corker said, \u201cLet\u2019s face it. It\u2019s going to be one bite at the apple.\u201d\n\nRepublicans failed when Senate Democrats banded together to block a resolution of disapproval from ever reaching President Barack Obama. On Thursday, the State Department said Obama would start issuing waivers on Oct. 18 so the U.S. is ready to grant sanctions relief if Tehran meets its obligations to curb its nuclear program.\n\nIran has to uninstall thousands of centrifuges at its facility at Natanz, its main site for enriching uranium; convert an underground nuclear site at Fordo into a research facility; and redesign its heavy water reactor at Arak so it cannot produce weapons-grade plutonium. Iran also has to ship its stockpile of enriched uranium abroad, and comply with an International Atomic Energy Agency investigation into its past nuclear weapons work.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear how long that will take.\n\nIf the IAEA finds that Iran has complied with key nuclear commitments, then sanctions imposed by the U.S., United Nations and Europe on Iran\u2019s energy, financial, shipping, auto and other sectors are to be suspended.\n\n\u201cThis so-called `Implementation Day\u2019 won\u2019t come for six to 12 months,\u201d said Mark Dubowitz, a sanctions expert and an opponent of the deal with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington-based policy institute.\n\nOne idea being discussed in Congress calls for shoring up oversight of Iran\u2019s compliance. Another measure would reauthorize the Iran Sanctions Act. The law was passed in 1996 to pressure foreign companies not to invest in Iran\u2019s oil and gas industries; it has since been expanded.\n\nOther legislation being weighed would strengthen security for Israel, which Iran has threatened to destroy, and for U.S. allies in the Persian Gulf worried about Iran gaining influence in the Mideast as a result of the deal.\n\n\u201cAlthough the congressional review period may be over, now the real work begins,\u201d Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., said in a speech Thursday at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\nCoons said preventing and deterring Iran from cheating must be a priority and even \u201cmarginal cheating and ambiguous evasions of the deal\u201d must be met with a heavy club. \u201cIran must not be left with any doubt that it will feel the pain of sanctions from the entire global community the moment it violates the agreement,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also wants the U.S. to improve Israel\u2019s ability to strike Iranian targets; ensure Israel\u2019s access to ordnance and aircraft needed to deter an Iranian attack; and provide for the sale of additional F-35s, plus more funding for Israel\u2019s array of anti-rocket and missile defense systems.\n\nTo further stabilize the region in the wake of the deal, Coons said the U.S. needs to strengthen the Gulf states\u2019 ability to counter threats from Iran.\n\nNew Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez, one of only four Senate Democrats to oppose the deal, wants Congress to renew the Iran Sanctions Act \u201cto ensure that we have an effective snapback option.\u201d\n\nSen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said he will propose legislation with Maryland Sen. Ben Cardin, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, to address some of the deal\u2019s \u201cshortfalls.\u201d Blumenthal and Cardin are Jewish and faced heavy lobbying from their constituents. In the end Blumenthal supported the deal; Cardin opposed it.\n\nBlumenthal said the two will offer legislation to provide an effective way to put sanctions back into place if Iran cheats, ensure strict adherence to the agreement, and enhance security assistance to Israel, including new joint-training exercises and inviting Israeli pilots to train to fly long-range bombers.\n\nLooming above all this debate is whether the agreement will last when Obama\u2019s successor walks into the Oval Office in 16 months.\n\nRepublican presidential candidates Ted Cruz, Scott Walker and Mike Huckabee have promised to abandon the accord. Asked if he would authorize a strike against Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities, Sen. Lindsey Graham replied: \u201cIf I believed they were trying to break out and get a bomb, absolutely. And here\u2019s the most important thing: They know I would if I had to.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "It's a done deal, yet opponents of the Iran nuclear agreement won't go quietly.", "pubdate": 20150919, "og": {"site_name": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "It's a done deal, yet opponents of the Iran nuclear agreement won't go quietly.", "title": "Iran nuclear deal is done, but debate in Congress isn't over", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/GettyImages-481661176.jpg", "url": "http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/iran-nuclear-deal-done-debate-congress-isnt/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "It's a done deal, yet opponents of the Iran nuclear agreement won't go quietly.", "title": "Iran nuclear deal is done, but debate in Congress isn't over", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/GettyImages-481661176.jpg", "creator": "@newshour", "site": "@newshour", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"app_id": 114150878604116}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newshour", "tag": "politics"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Barack Obama, congress, Iran, Iran nuclear deal, politics"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd622a\"", "article_summary": "WASHINGTON \u2014 It\u2019s a done deal, yet opponents of the Iran nuclear agreement won\u2019t go quietly.\nAnother measure would reauthorize the Iran Sanctions Act.\nAsked if he would authorize a strike against Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities, Sen.
