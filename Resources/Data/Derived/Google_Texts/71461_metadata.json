Aid agencies have been using Majuwa as a staging area to get supplies deeper into mountainous areas. \u201cEven seven days in this is still very much considered the early days, because there are people we still haven\u2019t reached. So we need helicopters to reach them.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is one of the poorest places on Earth. If the global community walks away, the people of this country will not receive the assistance that is required for them to rebuild their lives,\u201d she said.\n\nShe said shelter was a more urgent priority at this point than food.\n\nMore than 130,000 houses were destroyed in the quake, according to the U.N. humanitarian office. Near the epicenter, north of Kathmandu, whole villages were in ruins, and residents were in desperate need of temporary shelters against the rain and cold.\n\nThe magnitude-7.8 earthquake killed more than 6,600 people, with the death toll continuing to rise as reports filter in from isolated areas. The U.N. has estimated the quake affected 8.1 million people \u2014 more than a fourth of Nepal\u2019s population of 27.8 million.\n\nOn Friday, Nepal\u2019s government renewed its appeal to international donors to send tents, tarpaulins and basic food supplies, saying some of the items being sent are of little use.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Aid still scarce in Nepal\u2019s remote villages as anger grows", "title": "Aid still scarce in Nepal\u2019s remote villages as anger grows", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Aid still scarce in Nepal\u2019s remote villages as anger grows", "title": "Aid still scarce in Nepal\u2019s remote villages as anger grows", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/02/aid_still_scarce_in_nepals_remote_villages_as_anger_grows/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/nepal-earthquake.jpeg28-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Aid still scarce in Nepal\u2019s remote villages as anger grows", "title": "Aid still scarce in Nepal\u2019s remote villages as anger grows", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/nepal-earthquake.jpeg28-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Katy Daigle and Todd Pitman", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "So we need helicopters to reach them.\u201d\u201cThis is one of the poorest places on Earth.\nThe U.N. has estimated the quake affected 8.1 million people \u2014 more than a fourth of Nepal\u2019s population of 27.8 million.\nAid agencies have been using Majuwa as a staging area to get supplies deeper into mountainous areas.\nNear the epicenter, north of Kathmandu, whole villages were in ruins, and residents were in desperate need of temporary shelters against the rain and cold.\nOn Friday, Nepal\u2019s government renewed its appeal to international donors to send tents, tarpaulins and basic food supplies, saying some of the items being sent are of little use."}
