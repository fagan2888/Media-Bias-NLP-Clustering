Congressman Roe was blown away by how the faith based community in Charleston showed the country how faith in God can bring a community together to heal after a tragedy, something that is drastically different than we saw in Baltimore.

When asked if its time to ban the Confederate Flag, Roe believes it is time to remove the flag from government buildings because it represents hate but the state of South Carolina has to make the decision, although he says he believes they will do the right thing.

Roe said if Obamacare is gutted by the Supreme Court, we will have seven million people without access to health coverage. Roe said Republicans will get rid of the mandate and allow individuals to have access to the government subsidy and use it to shop for their own coverage that fits their needs. Roe said the main thing is to repeal Obamacare. One of Roe’s biggest concerns are for senior citizens, especially because of the so called “death panels” which as its set up has only one person making the decision for seniors health care.
