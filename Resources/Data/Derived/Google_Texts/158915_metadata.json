Whoever is driving this train must have considered Cooper Union as a possible station stop; a speech Lincoln gave there in 1860 may have made him president. But this speech wasn\u2019t that big, not by a long shot. The campaign settled on a spot a few blocks away, a smallish auditorium over at The New School.\n\nEven that venue was a bit of a reach. The New School has a history of innovative economic inquiry dating to its 1919 founding by such progressive lights as John Dewey and Thorstein Veblen, neither of whom, it\u2019s safe to say, would be backing Clinton today. When the school opened, the New York Times said its announced purpose was \u201cto seek an unbiased understanding of the existing order, its genesis, growth and present working.\u201d\n\nThe country could use a fresh, unbiased analysis of the existing order. Clinton\u2019s speech provided nothing of the sort.\n\nStill, it was well received in some quarters. At Vox, where much of what Clinton says is well received, Matthew Yglesias called her pledge to prosecute financial crimes \u201cthe most important words she has spoken thus far in the campaign.\u201d It\u2019s not saying much, as she hardly ever says anything substantive, let alone important. Yglesias likens her rhetoric to Elizabeth Warren\u2019s, but why Warren when so many other politicians now promise the same thing? He notes Clinton\u2019s \u201ctrust gap\u201d with \u201cactivists focused on the issue\u201d but says those activists can take \u201csuccor\u201d knowing that bringing such cases is one of the few ways a \u201csharply constrained\u201d President Clinton would have of \u201cleaving a mark.\u201d\n\nIn other words, count on her doing it because she won\u2019t be able to do much else.\n\nIn a piece written before the event and based on campaign backgrounders, Yglesias claims the speech marks Clinton\u2019s passage from neoliberalism to \u201cpaleoliberalism,\u201d as in the Paleolithic Age of hunter gatherers. He says it \u201chints at a fundamental philosophical difference\u201d Clinton now has with her husband, her old boss and her old self, and that it shows she is now \u201cless inclined to favor a market-oriented approach than a left-wing approach\u201d in which the financial sector is \u201cdeliberately regulated in a heavy handed way rather than allowed to lead the economy.\u201d\n\nYglesias says \u201cleft-wing interest group leaders\u201d tell him they\u2019re skeptical but he says \u201chistory suggests that presidents generally try to implement the agendas they have promised.\u201d He also says Clinton was never \u201cpurely\u201d a neoliberal\u2014she backed a minimum wage hike and was willing to let government play a bigger role in health care\u2014and that as president she\u2019d extend financial regulation and help strengthen unions. He noted that Clinton would not be delivering a \u201claundry list\u201d of specifics and that until she did no one could be quite sure what she was up to.\n\nThe Times\u2019 David Brooks also thinks Clinton is \u201cbest viewed\u2026 as a new paleoliberal.\u201d To Brooks it denotes a faith that \u201cgovernment is more competent at steering companies toward their own best interests than are the companies themselves.\u201d He says that many of her ideas have been proven wrong, that voters don\u2019t share her fondness for central planning and that she has \u201cno plausible chance\u201d of getting her agenda through Congress. Still, he says, she \u201chasn\u2019t gone crazy\u201d or ruined herself by \u201cwandering into the class warfare swamps.\u201d He thus concludes that politically she has \u201ccleared the first hurdle of this campaign\u201d by offering \u201ca coherent response to today\u2019s economic conditions.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Post\u2019s E.J. Dionne said \u201cClinton is making a major bid to shape the conversation\u201d that \u201ccould mark the beginning of a genuinely substantive debate between Democrats and Republicans over how to define the nation\u2019s economic problems.\u201d He quoted a \u201ccampaign official\u201d accusing Republicans of peddling \u201cthe same old proposals every Republican presidential candidate has been offering since Reagan\u201d; unlike Clinton, whose package of new benefits includes \u201cfamily leave, child care and more affordable access to college.\u201d The official seemed not to know that, good as some of Clinton\u2019s ideas may be, they are mostly the same ones Democratic candidates have been offering since Reagan.\n\nYglesias, Brooks and Dionne are fine writers. But their somewhat overlapping analyses, like Clinton\u2019s speech, perpetuate some habits we need to break. Clinton is no \u201cpaleoliberal,\u201d a more than faintly pejorative label liberals would do well to challenge. She, Bill and Barack Obama practically invented neoliberalism and remain members in good standing until proven otherwise. If your speeches are long on weepy tales of \u201ceveryday Americans\u201d you met on the campaign trail, but short on policy prescriptions, the credit goes to David Axelrod, not Paul Krugman. If you\u2019d raise the minimum wage but won\u2019t say how much, you\u2019re Mitt Romney. If you back the Trans Pacific Trade Partnership\u2013and despite recent evasions she\u2019s all for it\u2013you\u2019re fighting for capital, not labor.\n\nI.F. Stone once counseled young reporters not to develop inside sources. He said reporters do more for sources than sources do for them, and that anyway most of what we need to know lies right under our nose, hidden like Poe\u2019s purloined letter in a speech or a public record. It\u2019s sound advice, but especially if you\u2019re covering the Clinton campaign. Background interviews with insiders are catnip for reporters, few of whom would miss a chance to get out ahead of the pack. But if they\u2019d wait for the transcript they might reap the full rewards of textural criticism. To wit:\n\nYglesias\u2019 notion that presidents try to deliver on campaign promises may be right, notwithstanding Obama\u2019s spotty record. (See ethics reform, whistleblowers, the surveillance state, the public option, the minimum wage, etc.) But if you parse Hillary\u2019s speech you find that despite talking for 55 minutes she didn\u2019t make any promises, or at least none specific enough to be politically actionable. Her handlers did a fine job of prepping the press for yet another dearth of detail. But at this point \u201cinstructions to follow\u201d isn\u2019t a viable message for Clinton, nor should any reporter react to such assurances from any politician with anything but a long, loud groan.\n\nClinton\u2019s speech didn\u2019t spark a \u201csubstantive debate between Democrats and Republicans.\u201d If you\u2019ve so much as glanced at the GOP field, you know they won\u2019t be having one this year. Nor did it move the needle on the Democrats\u2019 debate, which moves away from Clinton even as she runs to chase it down. It\u2019s true for reporters and campaigns alike: If you focus too much on tactics, you miss the meaning of the race. What drives this race is not what the left wants; it\u2019s what middle-class families want. Their economic anxiety and outrage at the condition of our democracy is transforming politics in ways Obama never imagined.\n\nIt\u2019s this mood that David Brooks mistakes for the \u201cclass warfare swamps.\u201d Voters prize civility and long for a populism without culprits or conspiracies\u2013but sorely want to hear their righteous anger expressed. Clinton won\u2019t do it, in part because she can\u2019t offend the delicate sensibilities of her donors but also because, like Brooks, she mistakes the mood for a leftist insurrection. Many of us\u2013see Paul Rosenberg\u2019s wonderful article right here in Salon\u2013have long argued that the old categories are defunct and that much of what the old order calls radical has long since gone mainstream. Soon everyone will see it. For now, let me suggest a rule: any policy enjoying majority support in every poll must henceforth be called centrist, not \u201cradical\u201d or \u201cleft wing.\u201d If you aren\u2019t sure, look it up.", "article_metadata": {"description": "There's a reason Clinton's economic plan sounds wooden and unspecific.
