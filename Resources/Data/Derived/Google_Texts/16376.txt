Ventura police were looking Tuesday for a passenger who was riding with a man before he was shot by two officers outside the Ventura County Fairgrounds on Sunday afternoon.

The unknown man was seen jumping out of a pickup and running into the fairgrounds after the driver, Clemente Zamarripa-Mata, 26, of Ventura, ignored barricades and hit the Garden Street gate, authorities said. Later, Zamarripa-Mata hit another pickup, a shuttle bus and an officer before he was shot by police, officials said.

Police are not expecting to charge the passenger with any crime but hope he can shed some light on what happened before the incident that left Zamarripa-Mata in critical condition, said Cmdr. Darin Schindler.

Zamarripa-Mata remained in stable condition Tuesday in the intensive care unit of Ventura County Medical Center. Schindler said he is immobile and canâ€™t speak, so police are waiting until his condition improves to arrest and charge him.

He could face charges of assault with a deadly weapon, attempted homicide on an officer and hit-and-run, police said.
