A new Twitter account by revenue cycle vendor MedData is giving perhaps the best visual representation of just how vast the new ICD-10 diagnostic coding library is.

EveryICD10 has been sharing a new ICD-10 code and description on the social media platform by the minute since July 9, when it first tweeted, "E73.8 Other lactose intolerance #icd10."

Since then it has posted more than 14,500 codes, which at that rate could set it up to finish sharing all 68,000 of them by Oct. 1 when the new diagnostic library goes live.

Many healthcare providers have lamented the size of ICD-10's library, especially since the current ICD-9 code set has closer to 14,000 codes. But advocates say the level of specificity in ICD-10 will create more detailed patient records and help remove a lot of the guesswork when it comes to reimbursement claims.

Here's the account. While it might be a bit mind numbing to read all of these codes in succession, maybe the account's archive will help physicians to find the right code come launch day.
