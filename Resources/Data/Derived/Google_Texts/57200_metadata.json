When the case is argued on March 4, King \u2014 friendly, with graying hair and a mustache \u2014 will become the public face of King v. Burwell, the most significant threat to the Affordable Care Act since the 2012 Supreme Court case that put the law\u2019s individual mandate on the line.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cThis case is about the IRS illegally rewriting the law. It\u2019s not about anyone\u2019s political beliefs or what is on their Facebook page. Our plaintiffs simply want their day in court,\u201d said Sam Kazman of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, which says it is \u201ccoordinating and funding\u201d the Supreme Court case. Kazman declined to explain how the plaintiffs were chosen.\n\nKing has not spoken publicly, but Thursday morning he welcomed a reporter into his ranch-style home in a middle-income section of Fredericksburg, Virginia. He is skeptical of the media \u2014 offering to let a reporter in only to \u201cget the chill off\u201d a cold February morning \u2014 and wouldn\u2019t discuss the origins of his case.\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court is taking the case, so they obviously feel that it has merit,\u201d King told POLITICO in the living room of his home, which is lined with mementos from his Vietnam War service and pictures of family and close friends.\n\nA review of King\u2019s public social media accounts show he is a proud grandfather who loves his family, enjoys cooking and sharing photos from conservative blogs. One image shows a photo from the movie \u201cBack to the Future\u201d with instructions to the time traveler: \u201cMarty, there is no time to lose. You must go back in time and give Obama\u2019s dad a condom.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone is entitled to an opinion,\u201d King said of his Facebook page, the only other public comments he would make.\n\nOn Facebook, King frequently criticizes Obamacare and immigration policies and espouses support for limited government, the Second Amendment and Republican political candidates. He jokes often that the federal government is watching him.\n\n\u201cSo do you think NSA, FBI and the other three letter government workers watch face book? Just wonder because if they do I\u2019ll have a house full of them soon. I guess we will be able to enjoy a cold beer and make fun of the idiot in the White House,\u201d he posted on Oct. 8, 2013. \u201cI sued the irs over this bull shit so \u2026 get ready.\u201d\n\nCourt filings in this case show that he is married with no dependents, smokes tobacco and had a projected household income of $39,000 last year. He has owned a home in Fredericksburg since 1978, according to public records. He lives in the congressional district now represented by Rep. David Brat, who ousted former Majority Leader Eric Cantor in the primary last year.\n\nAccording to his Facebook page, he is a fan of Neil Diamond, \u201cDuck Dynasty\u201d and the New England Patriots.\n\nWhile King frequently posts political items on his public page, he has shared sensitive moments, too.\n\n\u201cI realized tonight that life isn\u2019t as bad as we make it out to be,\u201d he wrote in late 2014 after meeting a boy with a terminal illness and his father. \u201cHis son is about 4 years old and a beautiful little boy. His dad told me he only has another five years. I stood there with tears in my eyes. I\u2019ll pray for this little guy. So next time you think life is bad think about this little boy.\u201d\n\nIf King\u2019s lawsuit succeeds, the law\u2019s subsidies could be eliminated in at least 34 states and the insurance markets in those areas could become dramatically unbalanced toward the most sick and most expensive patients.\n\nKing is one of four Virginia residents who filed the lawsuit. The other three are: Douglas Hurst, a 63-year-old from Virginia Beach, who is married with no dependents and makes $35,000 a year; Brenda Levy, 64 and single from Richmond, who expects to earn $43,000; and 56-year-old Rose Luck of Petersburg, who is married and whose annual income is about $45,000.\n\nThe four plaintiffs argue that the way the health law is written does not allow the tax subsidies to go to residents of the 34 states that did not set up insurance exchanges. The law, they say, intended to grant subsidies only in states that set up exchanges.\n\nBacked by several Republican lawmakers who have filed briefs to the Supreme Court, they argue that the Obama administration has been illegally allowing residents of any state to get the subsidies.\n\nAll four of the challengers say they don\u2019t want to have to buy insurance under Obamacare\u2019s individual mandate and shouldn\u2019t have to accept the law\u2019s tax subsidies either.\n\nKing argues that because the Obama administration is illegally making him eligible for subsidies, he has to comply with the individual mandate. If he didn\u2019t get the subsidy, insurance would be \u201cunaffordable\u201d to him under the health law and he wouldn\u2019t have to worry about the individual mandate\u2019s penalties.\n\nThe Obama administration argues that the health law allows residents of any state to get a subsidy if his or her income level qualifies. It says that the challengers are improperly reading one line of the law \u2014 that subsidies go to an \u201cexchange established by the state\u201d\u2014 and not taking into account Congress\u2019 intent to give subsidies to everyone.\n\nThe district court sided with the Justice Department and the appeals court agreed. In July, the plaintiffs asked the Supreme Court to hear their case.\n\nKing\u2019s lawsuit was one of four very similar cases \u2014 all filed in 2013 \u2014 challenging the tax subsidies in Obamacare.\n\nIf King\u2019s case didn\u2019t get to the Supreme Court first, the role played by King could have been filled by the state of Indiana, the attorney general of Oklahoma or Jacqueline Halbig, the plaintiffs in the three other cases.\n\nHalbig, who filed her lawsuit in the District of Columbia, is a former Health and Human Services lawyer in the George W. Bush administration. Kazman, who is general counsel at CEI, is coordinating both the King and Halbig cases. Kazman has a history of challenging government regulations, such as the Sarbanes-Oxley law, fuel efficiency and environmental regulations.\n\nIf Halbig had lost in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, she could have immediately petitioned the Supreme Court, but she won. That 2-1 ruling delivered a blow to the law, but shifted her out of the most favorable position for Supreme Court review.\n\nLegal experts said lawyers pursuing a high-profile Supreme Court challenge often want a sympathetic litigant, but the personal story is usually more significant from a public relations perspective than as an arguing point in front of the justices.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re being honest, of course you care who is the face of your case,\u201d said University of Richmond law professor Kevin Walsh, a former clerk to Justice Antonin Scalia. \u201cAnyone would rather have a sympathetic person rather than a non-sympathetic person to the extent that you can control that variable.\u201d\n\nWalsh said the litigant\u2019s history matters more in the court of public opinion than in the court system itself.\n\n\u201cCriminal defendants win at the court all the time. [The justices] truly don\u2019t care about individual circumstances that have no bearing on the legal merits \u2026 What you really end up with are competing attempts to shape the media environment,\u201d he said.\n\nJosh Gerstein contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "The lead plaintiff in tax subsidies case will become the public face of King v.
