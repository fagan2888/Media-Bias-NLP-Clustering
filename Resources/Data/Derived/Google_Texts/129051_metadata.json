Eventually it was withdrawn.\n\n\n\nRead MoreDoes Obamacare need this tech tool?\n\n\n\nIn the Afrezza marketing deal struck last year, Mannkind won an upfront payment of $150 million, potential further milestone payments of up to $775 million and 35 percent of future profits.\n\nPriced at $7.54 for a daily dose of 12 units, Afrezza will be pricier than $3.14 Apidra, which is the injectable equivalent in Sanofi's drugs stable.\n\nAfrezza should not be used in patients with asthma, or those suffering from certain complications, however. It is also not recommended for smokers or recent ex-smokers.\n\n\n\nIndustry analysts have said they expect Afrezza to generate modest sales of about $182 million a year by 2019 according to Thomson Reuters Cortellis, given Exubera's problems and the restrictions on use.\n\n\n\nSanofi's diabetes division generates about $7 billion of sales annually and around 30 percent of group profits, but the patent on its Lantus insulin, the world's most prescribed, expires this year, and it expects little or no sales growth through 2018.\n\nRead MoreTax filers, confused over Obamacare, seek pros: CEO\n\nA poor diabetes performance in 2014 was one of the reasons Sanofi sacked chief executive Chris Viehbacher in October. The company is now betting on products like Afrezza and an improved version of Lantus called Toujeo.\n\n\n\nOrally delivered insulin is difficult to develop because the protein gets broken down in the stomach, but last year Danish group Novo Nordisk completed a Phase I trial of an oral version.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "cnbcnewsstory", "description": "Sanofi launched an inhalable insulin in the U.S. in a potential boost for its flagging diabetes drug sales and for patient quality of life.", "author": "CNBC", "og": {"site_name": "CNBC", "description": "Sanofi launched an inhalable insulin in the U.S. in a potential boost for its flagging diabetes drug sales and for patient quality of life.", "title": "No more needles: Inhaled insulin debuts in US", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2015/02/03/sanofi-launches-inhaled-insulin-for-diabetics.html", "image": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2014/12/03/102235784-157234605.1910x1000.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Sanofi launched an inhalable insulin in the U.S. in a potential boost for its flagging diabetes drug sales and for patient quality of life.", "title": "Sanofi launches inhaled insulin for diabetics", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2015/02/03/sanofi-launches-inhaled-insulin-for-diabetics.html", "image": {"src": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2014/12/03/102235784-157234605.1910x1000.jpg"}, "site": "@CNBC", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"ios": {"app_name": "CNBC Business News and Finance", "app_store_id": 398018310}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=398018310", "GOOGLEBOT": "unavailable_after: 31 Dec 9999 23:59:59 GMT", "keywords": "Biotech and Pharmaceuticals, US: News, Drugs, Biotech and Pharmaceuticals, Pharmaceuticals, Health Care, Sanofi SA, MannKind, Eli Lilly and Co, Novo Nordisk A/S, Pfizer Inc, business news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cnbc", "published_time": "2015-02-03T06:22:59-0500", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/CNBC", "section": "Biotech and Pharmaceuticals", "modified_time": "2015-02-03T06:23:42-0500", "tag": "Pfizer Inc"}, "pageNodeId": 102391742, "news_keywords": "Sanofi, inhalable insulin, diabetes"}, "article_summary": "Read MoreDoes Obamacare need this tech tool?\nThe company is now betting on products like Afrezza and an improved version of Lantus called Toujeo.\nRead MoreTax filers, confused over Obamacare, seek pros: CEOA poor diabetes performance in 2014 was one of the reasons Sanofi sacked chief executive Chris Viehbacher in October.\nAfrezza should not be used in patients with asthma, or those suffering from certain complications, however.\nOrally delivered insulin is difficult to develop because the protein gets broken down in the stomach, but last year Danish group Novo Nordisk completed a Phase I trial of an oral version."}
