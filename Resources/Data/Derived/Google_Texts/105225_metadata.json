That\u2019s why you come to the ballpark every day.\u201d\n\nFister was 5-7 with a 4.19 ERA in 15 starts and 10 relief appearances last season for Washington. He was 16-6 with a 2.41 ERA for the Nationals in 2014, when he finished eighth in NL Cy Young Award voting.\n\n\u201cWe feel good about the person that we\u2019re getting as well as the pitcher that we\u2019re getting,\u201d Astros general manager Jeff Lunhow said. \u201cThere were other options out there. We looked at a lot of them, but we feel good about this as the piece that makes the Astros the strongest for 2016.\u201d\n\nThe 31-year-old right-hander is 65-63 with a 3.42 ERA 167 starts and 13 relief appearances in seven major league seasons that also included time with Seattle (2009-11) and Detroit (2011-13). His 1.77 walks per nine innings is the lowest among active pitchers with 1,000 or more innings.\n\n\u201cI know Doug Fister makes us better,\u201d manager A.J. Hinch said. \u201cI know he\u2019s going to make big starts for us and, ultimately, when you wake up in January and you\u2019re in the manager\u2019s chair and Jeff calls and says we\u2019ve got Doug Fister signed to a contract, I wake up a pretty happy man.\u201d\n\nComing off its first postseason appearance in a decade, Houston projects to have a starting rotation that includes AL Cy Young Award winner Dallas Keuchel, Collin McHugh, Mike Fiers and Lance McCullers. Scott Feldman and Brad Peacock also are options.\n\n\u201cHaving guys like that to kind of lead the staff that\u2019s important,\u201d Fister said of Keuchel. \u201cKind of sets the tone for everybody. As a pitching staff we work together. I\u2019ve been blessed to be on some great teams, and I certainly feel blessed to be on this one.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Fister, a Washington Nationals right-hander the past two seasons, has agreed to a $7 million, one-year contract with the Houston Astros.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Fister, a Washington Nationals right-hander the past two seasons, has agreed to a $7 million, one-year contract with the Houston Astros.", "title": "Right-hander Doug Fister, Astros agree to $7M, 1-year deal", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/jan/28/right-hander-doug-fister-astros-agree-to-1-year-co/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/01/28/astros_fister_baseball.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/01/28/astros_fister_baseball.jpeg", "description": "Fister, a Washington Nationals right-hander the past two seasons, has agreed to a $7 million, one-year contract with the Houston Astros.", "card": "summary", "title": "Right-hander Doug Fister, Astros agree to $7M, 1-year deal"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Doug Fister"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1fed\"", "article_summary": "HOUSTON \u2014 Doug Fister was impressed by what he perceived as the Houston Astros\u2019 will to win.\n\u201cI know Doug Fister makes us better,\u201d manager A.J.\n\u201cHaving guys like that to kind of lead the staff that\u2019s important,\u201d Fister said of Keuchel.\n\u201cThe choice to come here is driven from the top down,\u201d Fister said Thursday after agreeing to a $7 million, one-year contract.\n\u201cWe feel good about the person that we\u2019re getting as well as the pitcher that we\u2019re getting,\u201d Astros general manager Jeff Lunhow said."}
