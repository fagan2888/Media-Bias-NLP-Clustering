Bannon ahead of Tuesday\u2019s Fox Business Network debate, Spicer acknowledged that \u201cmost conservatives, whether or not you\u2019re running for office or not, watch programs and realize that there is an unbelievable difference with how conservatives are treated.\u201d\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nCNBC was roundly criticized for its debate, which prompted RNC Chair Reince Priebus to suspend its ties with NBC and compelled the GOP presidential candidates to cut the RNC out of the debate negotiation process. And Spicer said the debates should be about \u201chow the candidates distinguish themselves in the solutions they have for the big problems that America is facing\u201d and \u201cwhat we\u2019re seeing is a bunch of series of gotcha-question interviews and not a debate amongst the candidates.\u201d\n\nHe said \u201ctoo often\u201d the debates have \u201cbecome about the moderator and not about the candidates.\u201d\n\nSpicer told Bannon that the format of the debates should \u201callow the candidates to express who they are and why they are seeking the presidency.\u201d\n\nRegarding media bias in general, Spicer said the \u201cmainstream media approaches Republicans vastly different than they do with liberals and Democrats\u201d because most reporters are liberal and \u201cthey approach every subject from that lens.\u201d He said the \u201cmainstream media start every interview with square one, we\u2019re right, you\u2019re wrong.\u201d\n\nHe said \u201call you have to do is look at how Hillary is treated especially about Benghazi and the email scandal.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe benefit of the doubt is constantly going to Hillary,\u201d Spicer said.\n\nIt is always well, she didn\u2019t mean it or of course, she wouldn\u2019t have known this. The default is to always to assume that Clintons and the liberals are right and can never do anything wrong. The default is always that conservatives must be doing something wrong, must be bad. And that\u2019s the bigger problem.\n\nSpicer\u2019s remarks, especially about what Mark Levin said was the Praetorian Guard media that protects Democrats and Clinton, could leave one to wonder why the Republican National Committee awarded a majority of the debates in this election cycle to liberal media outlets in the first place. Perhaps RNC officials have never read \u201cThe Scorpion and the Frog.\u201d\n\nAllowing the mainstream media to moderate so many debates without expecting them to ask \u201cgotcha questions\u201d or making it about the preening moderators would be like having NBA referee Joey Crawford (referees who do the best job get the least amount of attention) call a game and not expect him to make it all about him.", "article_metadata": {"description": "RNC strategist Sean Spicer acknowledged that most conservatives realize there's an unbelievable difference with how conservatives are treated", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "RNC strategist Sean Spicer acknowledged that most conservatives realize there's an unbelievable difference with how conservatives are treated", "title": "RNC Chief Strategist Blasts Debates for Being More About \u2018Gotcha\u2019 Questions and Moderators than Candidates - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/10/Losers-Getty.jpg", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2015-11-07T09:38:09-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/11/07/rnc-chief-strategist-blasts-debates-for-being-more-about-gotcha-questions-moderators-than-candidates/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "RNC strategist Sean Spicer acknowledged that most conservatives realize there's an unbelievable difference with how conservatives are treated", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/10/Losers-Getty.jpg", "title": "RNC Chief Strategist Blasts Debates for Being More About \u2018Gotcha\u2019 Questions and Moderators than Candidates - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": ",2016 Presidential Race, Big Government, Big Journalism,RNC", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "published_time": "2015-11-07T09:22:38-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,Big Journalism,2016 Presidential Race", "modified_time": "2015-11-07T09:38:09-07:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe440b\"", "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTEROn Breitbart News Saturday on Sirius XM Patriot channel 125, Sean Spicer, the Republican National Committee\u2019s chief strategist, criticized the media for making GOP presidential debates more about \u201cgotcha questions\u201d and the moderators than the candidates.\nThe default is to always to assume that Clintons and the liberals are right and can never do anything wrong.\nThe default is always that conservatives must be doing something wrong, must be bad.\nIt is always well, she didn\u2019t mean it or of course, she wouldn\u2019t have known this.\nAnd that\u2019s the bigger problem."}
