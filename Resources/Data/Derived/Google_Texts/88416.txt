The Vatican and the southern Italian bishops are trying to formulate a plan of action to combat those, “organized criminal gangs who still cloak themselves in symbols of Catholicism,” the Ndrangheta Mafia. So far they’ve floated the ideas of a ten year moratorium on Godparents and a ban on feast day processions. The problem they find is that the use of ‘religious symbols’ or ‘even sacraments’ allows these Mafia to ‘present a 'clean' face to society’ when of course they don’t really have clean faces.

While around the world in formerly peaceful western countries, Muslims are violently protesting Israel’s retaliation for the continuous rocket fire they get from Gaza Palestinians; one such protest occurred in Miami, Florida on Tuesday.

Biscayne Blvd.

Actor James Woods in a Twitter exchange proposed the idea that Obamacare when coupled with the forced placement of border-crossers in cities nationwide, adds up to political success in “an Obama kind of way.” He said the bureaucratic neglect of the sick would be a way of ‘thinning the herd’ of older more conservative voters, while Central American illegals flooding the country would vote reliably Democrat.

Zenit is reporting that, “a new interview with Pope Francis is to appear on Sunday in one of Argentina's best-selling magazines. “ Topics are the middle east, youth unemployment, the Pope’s upcoming encyclical on the environment, and his Vatican life. There’s nothing newsworthy or controversial in those themes perhaps.
