Go north on the avenue and you\u2019ll see another Duane Reade at West 106th Street. A little farther up, on West 110th Street and Broadway, stands a Rite Aid. On West 111th Street and Broadway is\u2014you guessed it\u2014another Duane Reade. That\u2019s four large-scale pharmacies in a nine-block stretch. (And if you were to slide one avenue over, you\u2019d find yet another Duane Reade on West 108th Street and Amsterdam Avenue.)\n\nIt is a familiar sight to anybody who has spent any time in this city: the ubiquitous drug store chain. This is the one business that seems immune to rent hikes or gentrification. The drug store shines in poor areas as well as rich ones. And it doesn\u2019t seem to matter that the nearest competition is two or three blocks away. It doesn\u2019t even seem to matter to a Duane Reade that the nearest competition is another Duane Reade.\n\n\u201cThe two sides of Broadway trade differently,\u201d a broker who has done deals with the big pharmacy chains explained.\n\nAnother broker in the know pointed out that you can find a Duane Reade across the street from Walgreens in Union Square, because they have different customers\u2014even if both sets are convenience-driven. Another retail specialist noted that perhaps one drug store chain could set up shop nearby a competitor, thinking the latter is underserved or its lease is coming due.\n\nPart of the reason why these drug stores have been so successful is that they have been intelligent about their real estate decisions.\n\n\u201cCVS always takes a corner for exposure [providing] two sides of frontage,\u201d said Jason Pruger, an executive managing director at Newmark Grubb Knight Frank who represents CVS Health\u2019s retail division CVS/pharmacy in New York City.\n\nAttorney Gary Rosenberg from Rosenberg & Estis, whose firm has represented landlords with drug store tenants, added: \u201cI think in Midtown where rents are so high, tenants still prefer just enough ground floor to cover their walk-ins and either below-grade or second-floor space to average down their rent.\u201d\n\nDuane Reade became a dominant force in the New York City market pre-Walgreens acquisition due to its strategy of snapping up mom-and-pop pharmacies as well as tons of leases to box the competition out. The New York-born Duane Reade didn\u2019t even open up stores in all of the locations it leased\u2014the drug store subleased out some of the space it gobbled up.\n\nTo a large extent, Duane Reade had to be savvy given how much was stacked in favor of its competitors.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a Duane Reade, if you compete against others, you don\u2019t have the buying power,\u201d said retired pharmacist Harry Sgantzos, who worked at a West Midtown Duane Reade for seven years until last year. \u201c[The competition\u2019s] buying costs are lower. They have centralized warehouses feeding multiple states.\u201d\n\nDuane Reade has been successful because it figured out how to use New York\u2019s fractious, scatterbrained floor plates to its advantage.\n\nSignage is obviously important, which one can get from a minimal amount of ground-floor space\u2014and once the signage is taken care of they can be flexible about everything else. \u201cThe way they\u2019ve set it up [is]\u2026they\u2019re focused on minimal ground floor, but looking for cheapest ground-floor space,\u201d Mr. Rosenberg said.\n\nOne of the brokers with knowledge of the drug store market said: \u201cDuane Reade is an urban model, so they can be the most nimble [with the multi-level stores].\u201d The others all come from suburban markets, he added, so they are less willing to compromise on size.\n\nRite Aid, for one, is not shrinking its floor plates or getting rid of pharmacists. But the stores are \u201cadding more front-end, or convenience store, products,\u201d the same broker said.\n\nCVS doesn\u2019t seem to be shifting its real estate strategy. \u201cIt seems like CVS is focused on larger stores,\u201d said a source. \u201cI don\u2019t understand the reasoning behind it.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the New York drug store has made itself as much a one-stop shop, as it is a pharmacy, which is often a little cubby in the back.\n\n\u201cI think the pharmacy category has evolved so that now people depend on them for everything from prescription drugs to breakfast cereal,\u201d said Peter Braus, a managing principal of Lee & Associates NYC. \u201cThey\u2019re basically what the neighborhood bodega used to be a decade ago.\u201d\n\nJoanne Podell, vice chairman of retail services at Cushman & Wakefield, noted: \u201cI liken them to five-and dimes with their home goods, etc.\u201d\n\nHowever, this comes at an interesting time; drug stores have been in a frenzy of mergers, which has been the industry response to pricing challenges, competition from supermarkets, club stores and other merchants, like Walmart and Amazon.com; as well as the national health care reform law, which has reduced the high margins for drugs.\n\nAs was widely reported in early November, Walgreens Boots Alliance is acquiring Rite Aid for $17.2 billion, whittling down the number of big drug store players in the country to two. The acquisition \u201ccomplements Walgreens\u2019 footprint, filling gaps in the Northeast and Southern California so [Walgreens] will cover the entire U.S.,\u201d Walgreens said in its investor materials.\n\nBetween Walgreens\u2019 8,200 stores and Rite Aid\u2019s 4,600 locations, the conglomerate will have 12,800 stores nationwide. Together they will own half or more of the drugstore market share in the 14 largest major U.S. cities, Business Insider reported. CVS, meanwhile, has 7,800 stores.\n\nIn Manhattan alone, Duane Reade, owned by Walgreens since 2010, is the dominant force with 91 stores. According to a Manhattan drug store market map from November created by The Shopping Center Group, the rest of the stores break down in the borough as follows: Walgreens (12), Rite Aid (29) and CVS (44).\n\nA retail broker with familiarity with the drug store business in New York City said that prescriptions used to drive the business, and the front-of-the-store goods were secondary. \u201cNow it\u2019s the opposite,\u201d he said, because of the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare. \u201cAll these stores have to have much higher margins and need to be more efficient from a sales perspective,\u201d he added.\n\nDue to Obamacare, more people are using insurers to pay for their prescriptions, and private insurance companies reimburse at a price less than full retail. Walmart said in an August media call that part of its reduced profit outlook was due to the Affordable Care Act, Quartz reported.\n\nAt Duane Reade, the merger of its parent company Walgreens with Alliance Boots in December 2014 has resulted in the New York-centric brand bringing in better quality products to the front of the shop, brokers said. One source speculates that Duane Reade may even abandon pharmacies in some of its stores where there is a full-service Duane Reade within a couple of blocks. (The Duane Reade at 184 West 23rd Street in the Flatiron District that doesn\u2019t have a pharmacy is a case in point.)\n\nAs a result of the Walgreens-Rite Aid deal, slated to close in the second half of next year, redundant stores are likely to be eliminated \u201cbut now Rite Aid will have capital to expand and relocate stores that are doing well,\u201d one broker in the know said.\n\n\u2018The pharmacy category has evolved so that now people depend on them for everything from prescription drugs to breakfast cereal. They\u2019re basically what the neighborhood bodega used to be a decade ago.\u2019\u2014Peter Braus of Lee & Associates NYC\n\nMeanwhile, Walgreens announced earlier this year that it plans to shutter 200 U.S. stores to cut costs.\n\nA spokeswoman for CVS said via email: \u201cWe continue to look for opportunities to open stores in the New York City market. Over the past few years, we\u2019ve reset many of our New York City stores to better serve our customers there. We\u2019ve found that many of our customers there use CVS/pharmacy more like a general store due to a lack of convenient alternatives. As a result, we now offer more healthy food options, grab-and-go products, etc., to serve those customers. The recent announcement made by our drugstore competitors does not change our strategy in New York City.\u201d\n\nMr. Pruger said the company has \u201can appetite for opening more stores\u201d and those have been consistently the same size for the last eight years.\n\n\u201cWith the density of 52 million tourists, 15 million people coming into Manhattan and 2 million residents, there\u2019s a need,\u201d Mr. Pruger said of the quotidian nature of drug stores in the city.\n\nWith so many of these drugstores per square block in New York City, how are these stores differentiating themselves?\n\nOn price for one thing, Ms. Podell said. \u201cIt\u2019s good for the consumer,\u201d she said. \u201cIt gives them a choice.\u201d\n\nJeffrey Roseman, an executive managing director at NGKF, said that he thinks drug store proliferation may have slowed down a bit. As for the future, he said: \u201cSome will start going into a smaller, more express model, rather than the previously standard 10,000- to 15,000-square-foot stores.\u201d Others, Mr. Rosenberg said, could start \u201ccarving out space for a doctor\u2019s office\u201d and providing more and more services like a doctor on call.\n\nRite Aid didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment and its New York metro area broker, Chase Welles of SCG Retail, declined to comment. Mike Riley of SRS Real Estate Partners, who represents Walgreens and its subsidiary Duane Reade, declined to comment, as did Walgreens\u2019 former broker, Patrick Smith of JLL (who was at SRS when he represented the national pharmacy chain).", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.section": "Features", "sailthru.author": "Lauren Elkies Schram", "description": "It is a familiar sight to anybody who has spent any time in this city: the ubiquitous drug store chain.", "og": {"site_name": "Commercial Observer", "description": "Cast your eyes south as you exit the West 103rd Street and Broadway subway station in Manhattan and you\u2019ll see a Duane Reade between West 102nd and West 103rd Streets.
