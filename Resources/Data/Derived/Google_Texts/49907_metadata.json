But there\u2019s one thing he has been unable to escape: criticism for his support of Common Core education standards.\n\nColumnist George Will is the latest to join a chorus of critics, penning an op-ed that berates Bush\u2019s \u201cimpatience\u201d in attempting to understand the opposition to Common Core.\n\nWill cites Bush\u2019s comments that \u201cstandards are different than curriculum\u201d and his claim that he would \u201cbreak out in a rash\u201d if curriculum was influenced by the federal government. But, Will contends, \u201cstandards will shape what is tested, and textbooks will be \u2018aligned\u2019 with the tests.\u201d\n\nThus, according to Will, standards do influence curriculum.\n\n\u201cIt is not about the content of the standards, which would be objectionable even if written by Aristotle and refined by Shakespeare,\u201d Will writes. \u201cRather, the point is that, unless stopped now, the federal government will not stop short of finding in Common Core a pretext for becoming a national school board.\u201d\n\nSimilar backlash has been pervasive since Bush\u2019s campaign announcement in early December.\n\n>>> Jeb Bush\u2019s Common Core Problem\n\nPolitico\u2019s senior education reporter Stephanie Simon called Bush\u2019s support for Common Core his \u201cmost glaring education policy weakness\u201d while likely 2016 candidate Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., rebuked Bush\u2019s position on Fox News\u2019 \u201cThe Kelly File.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor Jeb Bush to run in the primary will be very, very difficult because if you\u2019re going to be for a national curriculum and for Common Core and for No Child Left Behind, this accumulation of power in Washington, that\u2019s not very popular,\u201d Paul said in the interview.\n\nDespite the criticism, Bush has repeatedly defended his support for Common Core.\n\n\u201cIn my view, the rigor of the Common Core state standards must be the new minimum in classrooms,\u201d Bush said at a December education summit in Washington. \u201cFor those states choosing a path other than Common Core, I say this: Aim even higher, be bolder, raise standards and ask more of our students and the system.\u201d\n\nLast week, in a move that could foreshadow an official run, Bush resigned from his education foundation and is no longer a paid adviser for Academic Partnerships, a for-profit company that sells online courses to public universities.\n\n>>> Here\u2019s How People Reacted to Jeb Bush\u2019s 2016 Announcement, in 36 Tweets\n\nAides told the Washington Post that Bush wants to focus his time on politics, but others speculate the move is strategically driven in an effort to separate himself from his contested views on education.\n\nWill says Bush must listen to critics of Common Core, drawing a connection to the federal government\u2019s use of Title IX, which \u201cstripped colleges and universities of a crucial component of self-government.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf Bush does not see the pertinence of this episode to Common Core, which is the thin end of a potentially enormous federal wedge, he should not be put in charge of the executive branch,\u201d Will writes. \u201cAnd this talented man will not get the consideration he has earned unless he can credit the intelligence and goodwill of critics who might reciprocate, joyfully.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jeb Bush has been unable to escape criticism for his support of Common Core education standards.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Jeb Bush has been unable to escape criticism for his support of Common Core education standards.", "title": "Jeb Bush Faces Questions on Support for Common Core", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150103_JebBush.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-01-03T22:07:46+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/142CyIC"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Jeb Bush has been unable to escape criticism for his support of Common Core education standards.", "title": "Jeb Bush Faces Questions on Support for Common Core", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150103_JebBush.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Education", "tag": "common core", "published_time": "2015-01-04T03:01:34+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-03T22:07:46+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Jeb Bush, Common Core, George Will, Rand Paul"}, "article_summary": "But there\u2019s one thing he has been unable to escape: criticism for his support of Common Core education standards.\nIn the weeks since announcing he would explore a presidential run, Jeb Bush has emerged as the early frontrunner for Republicans in 2016.\nDespite the criticism, Bush has repeatedly defended his support for Common Core.\n\u201cIn my view, the rigor of the Common Core state standards must be the new minimum in classrooms,\u201d Bush said at a December education summit in Washington.\nColumnist George Will is the latest to join a chorus of critics, penning an op-ed that berates Bush\u2019s \u201cimpatience\u201d in attempting to understand the opposition to Common Core."}
