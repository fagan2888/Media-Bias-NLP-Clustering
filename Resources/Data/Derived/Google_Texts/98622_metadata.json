REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst/Files\n\n4740962\n\nOne particular testimony in a congressional hearing Thursday on Planned Parenthood\u2019s abortion practices could put the organization on its heels, documents obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation show.\n\nThe testimony will come from Sue Thayer, who worked as a center manager for Planned Parenthood for 17 years. According to her prepared statements, she will testify about questionable abortion practices she witnessed and talk about her federal complaint that alleges Planned Parenthood committed Medicaid fraud, used taxpayer money for abortion services, and tricked poor people into donating money.\n\n\u201cNo business, certainly no healthcare clinic, should view a woman\u2019s body as a profit center, yet that is exactly what Planned Parenthood does,\u201d reads the statement.\n\nThayer has teamed up with the Christian legal group Alliance Defending Freedom in federal False Claims Act complaint against Planned Parenthood, alleging that they issue far more pills than necessary in order to get more reimbursements, fraudulently billed the government for abortion services, and coerced donations out of Medicaid patients.\n\nThese accusations counter Planned Parenthood\u2019s claims that federal funds are never used for abortions.\n\n\u201cBecause I had access to the billing system for the whole affiliate, I also know that Planned Parenthood would bill Medicaid for abortion-related services \u2013 ultrasounds, office visits, blood tests, medications, and other services that were part of an abortion,\u201d the testimony reads. \u201cThese types of Planned Parenthood Medicaid billings for abortion-related services have also been found by government auditors in New York and Washington.\u201d\n\nThayer said Planned Parenthood would ask low-income patients to pay for services and pills and then still bill Medicaid for the full amount. Thayer said Planned Parenthood would receive full payment from Medicaid and count the patient\u2019s payment as a voluntary donation.\n\n\u201cI started working at Planned Parenthood believing that I could serve young women and make their lives better,\u201d she says in her testimony. \u201cOver nearly two decades inside Planned Parenthood, I learned that was a lie. Planned Parenthood is more concerned about its bottom line than it is about the health and safety of women.\u201d\n\nRead the full testimony here:\n\nThayer Testimony\n\nFollow Casey on Twitter and like him on Facebook\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
