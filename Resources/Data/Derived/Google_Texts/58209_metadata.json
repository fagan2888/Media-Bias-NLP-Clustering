They have played more minutes than most fourth-liners because Roy is slowly introducing young third-line wingers Mikko Rantanen, an 18-year-old rookie, and Borna Rendulic, 23, who is in his second year in North America.\n\nMitchell scored the game-winning goal in Saturday night\u2019s 6-3 victory over the visiting Dallas Stars. McLeod and Skille got the assists after producing a strong forecheck. The goal gave Colorado a 4-3 lead 8:11 into the third period and led to its first win.\n\n\u201cThey were mucking it up behind the net and found a way to give it to me in the slot. We can score goals,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cWe have some big bodies and we like to get on the forecheck and hang on to the puck. I\u2019m really happy with how the two wingers are playing with me.\u201d\n\nSo is Roy, who has used them in key defensive situations. \u201cI even matched them against (the Stars\u2019) top line,\u201d Roy said. \u201cThey\u2019re playing so well. They\u2019re physical. They finish their checks, blocked shots. They play smart hockey (and) don\u2019t over-handle the puck and get it deep. Good game management for these guys.\u201d\n\nMitchell is one of the few fourth-line forwards to see time on the power play and he and McLeod were used in the last minute of Thursday\u2019s opener against Minnesota, when goalie Semyon Varlamov was pulled for an extra attacker.\n\nFootnotes. Avalanche captain Gabe Landeskog, who has had surgery on each of his wrists after the last two seasons, had a career-high four points (two goals) on Saturday. His is the first Colorado player to have a four-point game since Paul Stastny on Dec. 16, 2013, against Dallas. \u2026 The Avs had Sunday off. They will practice Monday and Tuesday before concluding their three-game homestand Wednesday against the Boston Bruins, who are 0-2 entering Monday\u2019s game against Tampa Bay. \u2026 Colorado\u2019s 10 goals are their most through the first two games of the season. The previous high was nine in 2013-14. \u2026 The Avs\u2019 66.7 percent power play (4-of-6) leads the NHL.\n\nMike Chambers: mchambers@denverpost.com or @mikechambers", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado Avalanche leaning on strength of its fourth line", "title": "Colorado Avalanche leaning on strength of its fourth line", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/10/11/colorado-avalanche-leaning-on-strength-of-its-fourth-line/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151011_030405_colorado-avalanche.jpg", "height": 428}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151011_030405_colorado-avalanche.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-11T15:00:54+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T06:10:54+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce18e\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThey\u2019re playing so well.\nThrough two games, the Avalanche\u2019s best line has probably been its fourth line.\nI\u2019m really happy with how the two wingers are playing with me.\u201dSo is Roy, who has used them in key defensive situations.\nHis is the first Colorado player to have a four-point game since Paul Stastny on Dec. 16, 2013, against Dallas.\nThe goal gave Colorado a 4-3 lead 8:11 into the third period and led to its first win."}
