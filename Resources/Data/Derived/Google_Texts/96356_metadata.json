NO WORRIES\n\nMost people don\u2019t need to do anything. Even before the health care law passed in 2010, more than 8 out of 10 U.S. residents had coverage, usually through their workplace plans or the government\u2019s Medicare or Medicaid programs. Some have private policies that meet the law\u2019s requirements.\n\nIf you\u2019re already covered that way, you meet the law\u2019s requirements.\n\nSince October, about 4 million people have signed up for private plans through the new state and federal marketplaces, the Obama administration says, although it\u2019s not clear how many were already insured elsewhere. In addition, many poor adults now have Medicaid coverage for the first time through expansions of the program in about half the states.\n\nPresident Barack Obama is urging people who have coverage to help any uninsured friends and relatives get signed up.\n\nNEED COVERAGE? IT\u2019S CRUNCH TIME\n\nChances are you\u2019ll hear more reminders about health care this month. The push is on to reach millions of uninsured people.\n\nThe administration, insurers, medical associations and nonprofit groups are teaming up with volunteers to get the word out and guide people through the sometimes-rocky enrollment process. They plan special events at colleges, libraries, churches and work sites.\n\nSinging cats, dogs, parrots \u2013 even a goldfish \u2013 are promoting the message in TV and online spots from the Ad Council.\n\nA big hurdle for the effort: As recently as last month, three-fourths of the uninsured didn\u2019t know there was a March 31 deadline, according to polling conducted for the Kaiser Family Foundation. Most said they didn\u2019t know much about the law and had an unfavorable opinion of it.\n\nPlus, many worry they won\u2019t be able to afford the new plans.\n\nThe enrollment campaign is emphasizing that subsidies are available on a sliding scale to help low-income and middle-class households pay for their insurance.\n\nHow to enroll? Start at HealthCare.gov or by calling 1-800-318-2596. Residents of states running their own marketplaces will be directed there; people in other states go through the federal exchange.\n\nAfter March 31, many people won\u2019t be able to get subsidized coverage this year, even if they become seriously ill.\n\nThe next open enrollment period is set to begin Nov. 15, for coverage in 2015.\n\nDEADLINE DETAILS\n\nThere are exceptions. The big one is the Medicaid program for the poor. People who meet the requirements can sign up anytime, with no deadline.\n\nAlso, people remain eligible for Medicare whenever they turn 65.\n\nIf you are insured now and lose your coverage during the year, by getting laid off from your job, for example, you can use an exchange to find a new policy then. People can sign up outside the open enrollment period in special situations such as having a baby or moving to another state.\n\nYou can choose to buy insurance outside the marketplaces and still benefit from consumer protections in the law.\n\nPeople who do that wouldn\u2019t normally be eligible for premium subsidies. But the Obama administration says exceptions will be made for people whose attempts to buy marketplace insurance on time were stymied by continuing problems with some enrollment websites.\n\nMILLIONS OF PEOPLE WON\u2019T GET COVERED\n\nSome 12 million people could gain health coverage this year because of the law, if congressional auditors\u2019 predictions don\u2019t prove overly optimistic.\n\nEven so, tens of millions still would go without.\n\nThat\u2019s partly because of immigrants in the country illegally; they aren\u2019t eligible for marketplace policies.\n\nSome of the uninsured will not find out about the program in time, will find it confusing or too costly, or will just procrastinate too long. Some feel confident of their health and prefer to risk going uninsured instead of paying premiums. Others are philosophically opposed to participating.\n\nFiguring out just how many of the uninsured got coverage this year won\u2019t be easy because the numbers are fuzzy.\n\nThe administration\u2019s enrollment count includes people who already were insured and used the exchanges to find a better deal, or switched from private insurance to Medicaid, or already qualified for Medicaid before the changes.\n\nSome who sign up will end up uninsured anyway, if they fail to pay their premiums.\n\nThe budget experts predict enrollment will grow in future years and by 2017 some 92 percent of legal residents too young for Medicare will have insurance.\n\nBut even then, about 30 million people in the United States would go uncovered.\n\nSOME ARE LEFT OUT\n\nA gap in the law means some low-income workers can\u2019t get help.\n\nThe insurance marketplaces weren\u2019t designed to serve people whose low incomes qualify them for expanded Medicaid instead. But some states have declined to expand their Medicaid programs. That means that in those states, many poor people will get left out.\n\nPeople who fall into the gap won\u2019t be penalized for failing to get covered.\n\nSome others are exempt from the insurance mandate, too: American Indians, those with religious objections, prisoners, immigrants in the country illegally, and people considered too poor to buy coverage even with financial assistance.\n\nTHE IRS IS WATCHING YOU\n\nThe law says people who aren\u2019t covered in 2014 are liable for a fine. That amounts to $95 per uninsured person or approximately 1 percent of income, whichever is higher. The penalty goes up in later years.\n\nA year from now, the Internal Revenue Service will be asking taxpayers filing their forms for proof of insurance coverage. Insurance companies are supposed to provide that documentation to their customers.\n\nIf you owe a penalty for being uninsured, the IRS can withhold it from your refund.\n\nThe agency can\u2019t put people in jail or garnishee wages to get the money. But it can withhold the penalty from a future year\u2019s tax refund.\n\n\u2014\n\nThis report was written by Associated Press reporter Connie Cass.
