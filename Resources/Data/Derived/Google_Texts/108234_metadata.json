Volkswagen said Friday that a diesel emissions-cheating scandal would cost it an astounding $18.2 billion just for 2015, while Daimler revealed that U.S. authorities are sniffing around its tailpipes.\n\nBoth companies saw a niche with U.S. buyers who wanted performance, gas mileage and clean air. But there is growing evidence that neither was able to back up the claims without violating pollution standards.\n\nOn Thursday, Daimler said the U.S. Justice Department asked the company to investigate irregularities in diesel emissions in its Mercedes brand vehicles.\n\nVolkswagen on Friday posted a net loss of 1.58 billion euro for 2015.\n\nFor 2016, Volkswagen said group revenue would fall as much as 5 percent, partly because of the emissions issue. It expects a \u201csharp decline\u201d in passenger car revenue, the company said.
