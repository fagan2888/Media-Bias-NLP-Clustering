She was confused about it being so far away from Tulsa, he was busy with something and didn\u2019t want to get on the phone to hear the directions himself. A comedic conversation characteristic of a long-married couple ensued.\n\nI always wondered if those folks actually made it to the event, but I\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019re still married \u2013 pretty sure.\n\nLongtime Tulsans don\u2019t think about how confusing it can be to get around town or how odd it sounds to a visitor who asks about a restaurant to say, \u201cthat\u2019s over in Blue Dome.\u201d\n\nSounds like it\u2019s in a football stadium instead of describing a Tulsa district.\n\nThe most-asked question is the easiest to answer: \u201cWhere do I get tickets?\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t need tickets and everything is free.\n\nIt leads to the second-most asked question: \u201cReally? Are you sure, for everything?\u201d\n\nYes, I\u2019m sure.\n\nIf you want a good seat or a good view, just get to where you\u2019re going early.\n\nTo help with directions last time around we provided a Google Earth \u201cflyover\u201d of the area. It helped people from out-of-town to understand the lay of the land, and water. It had a lot of online views.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Tulsa World", "description": "Watch a Google Earth fly-over to get your bearings on the 2016 GEICO Bassmaster Classic at Tulsa and Grand Lake O' The Cherokees.", "title": "Here's your fly-over guide to the 2016 'Super Bowl of Bass Fishing'", "url": "http://www.tulsaworld.com/blogs/sports/outdoors/here-s-your-fly-over-guide-to-the-super-bowl/article_3ddfe44a-cdce-57c4-8995-d208a4e0bd02.html", "image": "http://www.tulsaworld.com/app/tulsa_world_ogimage.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@tulsaworld", "card": "summary", "creator": "@@kellybostian"}, "description": "Watch a Google Earth fly-over to get your bearings on the 2016 GEICO Bassmaster Classic at Tulsa and Grand Lake O' The Cherokees.", "fb": {"app_id": 288003941350366}, "keywords": "fly fishing,recreational fishing,bass fishing,fishkeeping,fishing,fly,outline of fishing,tom rosenbauer,the super bowl,tulsa,kansas,illinois,cherokees,grand lake,naperville,blue dome,super bowl,the bassmaster classic,online views,western kansas,google,outdoors,sportsextralatest,kellybostian", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/https://www.facebook.com/kelly.bostian"}, "news_keywords": "fly fishing,recreational fishing,bass fishing,fishkeeping,fishing,fly,outline of fishing,tom rosenbauer,the super bowl,tulsa,kansas,illinois,cherokees,grand lake,naperville,blue dome,super bowl,the bassmaster classic,online views,western kansas,google,outdoors,sportsextralatest,kellybostian"}, "article_summary": "It\u2019s Super Bowl weekend and what is dominating my thoughts instead is the Super Bowl of Bass Fishing.\nRemember me on this computer Login Screen Name or Email Now I remember!\nIf you feel you are currently subscribed please click on the button to attempt to find your account.\nTo help with directions last time around we provided a Google Earth \u201cflyover\u201d of the area.\nOne month from today, Sunday, March 6, will be the final day of the 2016 GEICO Bassmaster Classic at Grand Lake O\u2019 The Cherokees and Tulsa."}
