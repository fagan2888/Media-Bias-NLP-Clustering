A Hutchinson man is in custody after he allegedly broke into a home and groped three young girls early Sunday morning.

Police say the man broke into a home in the 200 block of South Monroe Street and groped three girls: one 10-year-old and two 9-year-olds.

The girls' father chased the man from the home and police later found him walking around the area, Lt. John Moore told KAKE News.

Lt. Moore says 21-year-old Tyler Lee Ford was arrested around 2 a.m. for aggravated burglary and three counts of aggravated indecent liberties with a child.

Police say the discovery of a piece of evidence has further convinced them they have the right guy. They say they found Ford's cell phone in the girls' bedroom. They say the girls do not know Ford and Ford has no known connection to them, so police say it will be difficult for him to explain why the phone was there.

Ford does live within a block of the home police allege he broke into.

KAKE News went to Ford's address. A man who identified himself as Ford's father answered the door and did not want to speak on camera. But he said when it comes to Tyler, "He's where he should be. He made his own choices and now he's going to have to deal with them." He also said, "drugs and alcohol" were likely involved.

Kansas Department of Corrections records show that Ford was convicted of theft in November of 2012 and for burglary and theft in June of this year. He is currently on intensive supervision probation.

Neighbors say they're stunned by the crime, especially given there's an elementary school just down the street.

"That hits me to my heart," said neighbor Marci Martinez, who says she worked for a preschool for six years. "I have no sympathy whatsoever for any person that hurts a child in any sort of way."

Tyler Ford is being held at the Reno County Jail on $85,000 bond.
