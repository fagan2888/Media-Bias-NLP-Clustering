Check out his must-read piece about the long-term thinkers who are crowing about Ted Cruz complying with Obamacare, \u201ceven though\u201d he wants to repeal it.\n\nI don\u2019t have anything to add to Antle\u2019s take, except for the barrage of tweets I\u2019ve already fired off at these geniuses. So here you go:\n\nBREAKING NEWS FROM @Tara_CR: Republican Forced to Comply with Law He Wants to Repeal \u2014 Jim Treacher (@jtLOL) March 24, 2015\n\nTed Cruz is complying with the law. That means he's a hypocrite for wanting to repeal it. #logic @Tara_CR \u2014 Jim Treacher (@jtLOL) March 24, 2015\n\nTed Cruz is complying with Obamacare. That means he's a hypocrite. Obama only complies with the laws that suit him. That means he's not. \u2014 Jim Treacher (@jtLOL) March 24, 2015\n\nYou're actually gloating about forcing your awful law on people. MT @SenateDems Ted Cruz: Obamacare for me, but not for thee. \u2014 Jim Treacher (@jtLOL) March 24, 2015\n\n\"I don't like this law. It should be repealed.\" \"Yeah, well, until then it's the law.\" \"Okay, I'll comply.\" \"GOTCHA!\" @TheDemocrats #fascism \u2014 Jim Treacher (@jtLOL) March 24, 2015\n\nNo wonder @TheDemocrats think Ted Cruz submitting to Obamacare is a big gotcha. When they don't like a law, they just break it. \u2014 Jim Treacher (@jtLOL) March 24, 2015\n\n#FTFY MT @TheDemocrats RT to congratulate Ted Cruz on being one of millions to submit to an awful, awful law called Obamacare \u2014 Jim Treacher (@jtLOL) March 24, 2015\n\n#FTFY MT @thinkprogress After pledging to \u2018repeal every word of Obamacare,\u2019 Cruz admits he\u2019s complying with the law until then \u2014 Jim Treacher (@jtLOL) March 25, 2015\n\nCan't wait to not watch Jon Stewart's googly-eyed \"Wha-wha-WHAAAA??\" over Ted Cruz complying with a law even though he wants to repeal it. \u2014 Jim Treacher (@jtLOL) March 25, 2015\n\n.@TedCruz: \"Obamacare is a bad law, but I have no choice but to comply until it's repealed.\" @JuddleGum: \"A-HA!!!!!\" \u2014 Jim Treacher (@jtLOL) March 25, 2015\n\nThis is a good line of attack, totalitarians. Smugly mocking people for obeying an unpopular law they want to repeal? That simply cannot backfire.\n\nAnd now that Cruz has signed up for Obamacare, he\u2019s sure to use his public platform to tell everybody how great it is for him and his family, right?\n\nRight?\n\nHello? Guys? Where\u2019d you go?\n\nUpdate: Never mind, everybody, Obamacare is awesome!", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Jim Treacher", "description": "\"Surely Senate Democrats can provide better evidence that a law #works than the fact that people with large public profiles comply with it.\" So says Jim", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "\"Surely Senate Democrats can provide better evidence that a law #works than the fact that people with large public profiles comply with it.\"    So says Jim Antle.
