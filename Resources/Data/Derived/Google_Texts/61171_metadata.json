The charge never made much sense as it relates to \u201cObamacare,\u201d but for GOP policymakers, the principle was all the same: keep politics out of exam rooms.\n\nThey never meant a word of it.\n\nIn Kansas a couple of years ago, Republican state lawmakers approved a proposal called the \u201cWomen\u2019s Right to Know Act,\u201d which, among other things, required doctors to tell abortion patients that there\u2019s a link between breast cancer and terminating pregnancies. In reality, the National Cancer Institute insists there is no link, but GOP policymakers in Kansas didn\u2019t care. In effect, they mandated state-endorsed lying.\n\nAs Amanda Marcotte noted yesterday, something similar is unfolding in Arizona.\n\nDoctors in Arizona might soon be required to tell women that abortions can be \u201creversed.\u201d As the Washington Post reports , the Arizona legislature just passed a bill that is the latest in state-based attempts to ban women from using their own health insurance to pay for abortion. What makes this bill especially Orwellian is this attempt to force doctors to put the stamp of medical authority on the fantastical belief that women en masse are regretting their abortions hours after getting them and are miraculously getting them reversed through heroic interventions by Christian doctors. [\u2026] Forcing doctors to \u201cinform\u201d patients about an intervention that isn\u2019t medically useful and isn\u2019t really in demand serves no other purpose but to inject anti-choice histrionics into what is already a stressful situation for many patients. You should be able to get through an abortion without having to indulge a right-wing delusion.\n\nEvidently, Republicans in Arizona\u2019s legislature don\u2019t find this persuasive.\n\nTo be sure, the state legislation is pretty extreme in its own right, attempting to \u201cblock women from purchasing insurance plans through the federal health-care exchanges that cover abortion.\u201d But for proponents of reproductive rights, this junk-science provision makes the bill that much more outrageous.\n\nThe bill passed both chambers of the Republican-run Arizona legislature this week and is now headed for Gov. Doug Ducey\u2019s (R) desk.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to think of a more obvious example of big-government conservatism than state-mandated medical lies. As with the Kansas effort a couple of years ago, we\u2019re talking about an Arizona proposal that (a) puts politicians\u2019 rhetoric between patients and physicians; (b) gives instructions to medical professionals as to what they must say, whether the doctors want to or not; and (c) mandates that patients receive information that isn\u2019t scientifically accurate.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "It's hard to think of a more obvious example of big-government conservatism than state-mandated medical lies.", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/arizona-measure-would-push-lies-exam-rooms", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "It's hard to think of a more obvious example of big-government conservatism than state-mandated medical lies.", "title": "Arizona measure would push lies into exam rooms", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/arizona-measure-would-push-lies-exam-rooms", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/articles/h_14497835.jpg?itok=9tECkbLD", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/arizona-measure-would-push-lies-exam-rooms", "image": {"width": 830, "identifier": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/articles/h_14497835.jpg?itok=aQaSwPbm", "height": 553}, "title": "Arizona measure would push lies into exam rooms", "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "It's hard to think of a more obvious example of big-government conservatism than state-mandated medical lies."}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2015-03-27T10:41:18-04:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "nv": {"author": "steve-benen", "tags": "abortion,arizona,equality,reproductive-rights,war-on-women,women,rachel-maddow-show", "title": "Arizona measure would push lies into exam rooms", "published": 1, "date": "03/27/2015 10:41:18 EDT", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/arizona-measure-would-push-lies-exam-rooms"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/steve.benen"}, "abstract": "It's hard to think of a more obvious example of big-government conservatism than state-mandated medical lies.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Equality, Women, Abortion, Arizona, Reproductive Rights, War On Women"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce5d9\"", "article_summary": "The bill passed both chambers of the Republican-run Arizona legislature this week and is now headed for Gov.\nThe charge never made much sense as it relates to \u201cObamacare,\u201d but for GOP policymakers, the principle was all the same: keep politics out of exam rooms.\nIt\u2019s hard to think of a more obvious example of big-government conservatism than state-mandated medical lies.\nIn reality, the National Cancer Institute insists there is no link, but GOP policymakers in Kansas didn\u2019t care.\nFor much of the fight over the Affordable Care Act, Republicans condemned the very idea of government putting itself between patients and their physicians."}
