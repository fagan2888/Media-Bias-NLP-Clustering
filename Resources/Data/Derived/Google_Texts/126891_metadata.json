He was 88.\n\nThe cause was melanoma, his son Alan said.\n\nWhen Dr. Fein began working on health issues as a young aide in the administration of Harry S. Truman, health care accounted for about 3 percent of the American economy. By the time he weighed in as a respected elder in the field during the debate over President Obama\u2019s health care proposals, the expenditures had risen to 18 percent, an amount roughly equal to the economy of France.\n\nAs the money Americans spent on medical care increased, so did the role of economists specializing in health issues. Dr. Fein moved between government and academia, offering research and views on issues like meeting the demand for physicians. During the administration of President Lyndon B. Johnson, he led a public-private panel to develop ideas for the Medicare legislation, which, along with Medicaid, was signed into law in 1965.\n\nDr. Fein, a proud liberal, regretted that Medicare did not apply to everyone, just as he was disappointed that Mr. Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act did not consolidate insurance payments under the federal government. A federal single-payer system, he maintained, would be more cost effective and inclusive. The Obama plan, passed by Congress, relies on private insurance.\n\nBut Dr. Fein was nonetheless satisfied with incremental progress, Dr. Ezekiel J. Emanuel, chairman of the department of medical ethics and health policy at the University of Pennsylvania, said in an interview on Thursday. He quoted Dr. Fein, a former professor of his, as saying, \u201cGetting everybody under the tent is better than standing on principle and not getting anything.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDr. Fein regarded both Medicare and the Affordable Care Act as important steps toward the overriding goal of helping \u201cthe people who have the least,\u201d Dr. Emanuel said. In his 1986 book, \u201cMedical Care, Medical Costs: The Search for a Health Insurance Policy,\u201d Dr. Fein wrote, \u201cDecent people \u2014 and we are decent people \u2014 are offended by unnecessary pain and suffering; that is, by pain and suffering for which there is a treatment and for which some (who are affluent) are treated.\u201d\n\nMr. Fein was born in the Bronx on Feb. 6, 1926. His father, Isaac, was a history professor whose work took him to a chain of cities in the United States and Canada, including Winnipeg, Manitoba; and Bridgeport, Conn. His mother, the former Chaya Wertheim, was a schoolteacher.\n\nMr. Fein\u2019s son Alan said his father and his father\u2019s younger brother, Leonard \u2014 who went on to found organizations to combat hunger \u2014 had gotten their zeal for social justice from their parents.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cMy preference for a universal insurance program derives from my image of a just society,\u201d Dr. Fein wrote in his 1986 book. \u201cIt is an image based on a broadly defined concept of justice and liberty, nurtured by stories my parents told me, the books they encouraged me to read, and the values they expressed. To them, liberty meant more than political freedom; it also meant freedom from destitution \u2014 in Roosevelt\u2019s phrase, \u2018freedom from want.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAfter graduating from Central High School in Bridgeport, Dr. Fein was a Navy radar technician during World War II. He went on to earn a bachelor\u2019s degree in economics and a doctorate in political economy from Johns Hopkins University.\n\nIn 1952, he took a teaching post at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, while working on a Truman administration commission charged with exploring the possibilities for national health insurance.\n\nSix years later, he led a study by the federal Joint Commission on Mental Illness and Health, which estimated that mental illness cost the United States $3 billion a year ($24.7 billion in today\u2019s dollars) in treatment costs and lost work years, a small fraction of the estimated costs today.\n\nIn 1961, Dr. Fein became a senior staff member on the Council of Economic Advisers under President John F. Kennedy. He studied education issues in addition to helping to write legislation for Medicare. He moved on to the Brookings Institution as a senior fellow in 1963 and remained with it while directing the Medicare panel for Johnson, Kennedy\u2019s successor.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAfter leaving Brookings, Dr. Fein was a professor of economics at the Kennedy School of Government and the Medical School of Harvard University. He retired in 1999.\n\nIn addition to his son Alan, Dr. Fein is survived by his wife of 65 years, the former Ruth Judith Breslau; another son, Michael; a daughter, Karen Fein; and four grandchildren. Another daughter, Bena Fein, died in 1995. Dr. Fein\u2019s brother, Leonard, died in August.\n\nDr. Fein spoke of the importance of language in describing health care, deriding the term \u201cdeath panels\u201d that some opponents used in the debate over the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cA new language is infecting the culture of American medicine,\u201d he wrote in The New England Journal of Medicine in 1982. \u201cIt is the language of the marketplace, of the tradesman, and of the cost accountant. It is a language that depersonalizes both patients and physicians and describes medical care as just another commodity. It is a language that is dangerous.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140913183308, "twitter": {"description": "Dr. Fein\u2019s ethical and humanitarian perspectives on national health care were influential from the Truman administration to President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act.", "title": "Rashi Fein, Economist Who Urged Medicare, Dies at 88", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/14/us/rashi-fein-economist-who-urged-medicare-dies-at-88.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003112055"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/09/13/us/dog-fein-obit/dog-fein-obit-thumbLarge-v2.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/14/us/rashi-fein-economist-who-urged-medicare-dies-at-88.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003112055", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/14/us/rashi-fein-economist-who-urged-medicare-dies-at-88.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us", "hdl_p": "Rashi Fein, 88, Economist Who Urged Medicare, Dies", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Sept. 13, 2014", "edt": "NewYork", "keywords": "Deaths (Obituaries),Fein  Rashi (1926-2014),Health Insurance and Managed Care,Medicare,Fein  Rashi", "news_keywords": "Medicare", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Douglas Martin", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/09/13/us/dog-fein-obit/dog-fein-obit-thumbLarge-v2.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Fein, Rashi (1926-2014)", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By DOUGLAS MARTIN", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Dr. Fein\u2019s ethical and humanitarian perspectives on national health care were influential from the Truman administration to President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act.", "tom": "Obituary (Obit)", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/09/13/us/dog-fein-obit/dog-fein-obit-thumbStandard-v2.jpg", "description": "Dr. Fein\u2019s ethical and humanitarian perspectives on national health care were influential from the Truman administration to President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act.", "CG": "us", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Sept. 13, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "Obituary (Obit)", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/m/douglas_martin/index.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/national/index.html", "section": "U.S.", "modified": "2014-09-18", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp", "tag": "Medicare", "published": "2014-09-13", "section-taxonomy-id": "23FD6C8B-62D5-4CEA-A331-6C2A9A1223BE"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "slug": "14fein", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20140918093616, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/14/us/rashi-fein-economist-who-urged-medicare-dies-at-88.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/09/13/us/dog-fein-obit/dog-fein-obit-videoSixteenByNine600-v2.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Dr. Fein\u2019s ethical and humanitarian perspectives on national health care were influential from the Truman administration to President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act.", "title": "Rashi Fein, Economist Who Urged Medicare, Dies at 88"}, "pdate": 20140913, "des": "Medicare", "articleid": 100000003112055, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Rashi Fein, Economist Who Urged Medicare, Dies at 88", "PST": "Obituary (Obit)"}, "article_summary": "Photo\u201cMy preference for a universal insurance program derives from my image of a just society,\u201d Dr. Fein wrote in his 1986 book.\nIn 1961, Dr. Fein became a senior staff member on the Council of Economic Advisers under President John F.
