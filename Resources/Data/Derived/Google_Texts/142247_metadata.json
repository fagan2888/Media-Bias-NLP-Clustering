The orange fliers say \u201cEnroll now\u201d and explain where to get free in-person help signing up for health insurance from \u201csome of the top carriers in Illinois.\u201d The mailings stress that most people who signed up last year got financial help that lowered their costs.\n\nLast year, outreach concentrated on finding the uninsured in cities. In the second open enrollment season under the health law, the campaign will do more to find potential customers in rural areas, said Jennifer Koehler, the state\u2019s top official for Get Covered Illinois.\n\nRural outreach requires new tactics. What works well in Chicago may not work \u201cin parts of the state where people are literally spread out over hundreds of miles,\u201d she said in a conference call with reporters Wednesday.\n\nThree parts of the state will get the mailings. In northwestern Illinois, the fliers will go to 15,528 mailboxes in Rock Island County. In eastern Illinois, 16,553 mailboxes in Ford, Iroquois, Livingston and Vermilion counties will receive the information. And in the southern part of the state, 21,324 mailings will hit households in Franklin, Jackson, Perry and Williamson counties.\n\nThose areas are below the midpoint in population density for Illinois, according to census data.\n\nThe mailings are part of a $25.6 million state contract with St. Louis-based FleishmanHillard to promote health insurance coverage. The money comes from federal grants under the Affordable Care Act, but the work is supervised by the state of Illinois.\n\nThe second sign-up season under the health law continues through Feb. 15. Consumers must sign up by Dec. 15 for coverage to start on Jan. 1. The government is encouraging people who bought a health plan last year to return to HealthCare.gov to update their information and shop around to see if they can get a better deal.\n\nThe law requires most people to have health insurance. The penalty for having no health insurance in 2015 is going up to $325 per adult or 2 percent of household income, whichever is greater, up to a cap.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press medical writer Carla K.
