Gary Peters (D-Bloomfield Twp.), who is running for the U.S. Senate seat held by the retiring Carl Levin.\n\nFormer U.S. Rep. Hansen Clarke, Southfield Mayor Brenda Lawrence and state Rep. Rudy Hobbs are all battling -- and fighting hard -- for the nod from Democratic voters.\n\nAll three, plus candidate Burgess Foster of Detroit, responded to a bevy of questions on their pursuit of a congressional seat for MLive\u2019s voter guide.\n\nMore information about them, their reasons for running and their views on various topics are available here.\n\nFamiliar names\n\nWayne County Executive Bob Ficano is seeking re-election and is being challenged by a local mayor, the son of a former Detroit mayor, the son of his own predecessor and a popular former sheriff.\n\nState Rep. Phil Cavanagh -- son of former Detroit Mayor Jerome Cavanagh, former Wayne County Sheriff and Detroit Police Chief Warren Evans, County Commissioner Kevin McNamara -- the son of former Wayne County Executive Edward McNamara and Westland Mayor William Wild are all gunning to replace Ficano, whose held the top county position since 2003.\n\nOther Democratic candidates on the ballot in the county executive race include Adam Salam Adamski of Wayne, Cindy Darrah of Detroit, Russell George Leviska of Westland, Bettie Cook Scott of Detroit, Sigmunt John Szczepkowski, Jr. of Detroit and Christopher Wojtowicz of Hamtramck.\n\nFind out more on the candidates here.\n\nMichigan congressional delegation\n\nTuesday\u2019s election involves a number of races that will determine what type of politicians represent Michigan in Washington.\n\n11th District:\n\nU.S. Rep. Kerry Bentivolio (R-Milford) won his seat as a political newcomer in 2012 after the abrupt exit of former Congressman Thaddeus McCotter, who resigned amid a petition signature fraud scandal.\n\nHe\u2019s a staunch conservative with Tea Party support who\u2019s expressed a desire to see the president impeached and introduced a federal website security bill that he hoped would undermine Obamacare.\n\nHis opponent David Trott is widely viewed as a more mainstream Republican who's campaign has raised millions more than Bentivolio.\n\nThe massive fundraising difference -- $3.4 million to $515,475 at the end of June -- indicates a major advantage for Trott, but a stunning primary upset in Virginia earlier this year showed money isn\u2019t everything.\n\nVirginia Republican David Brat, a relative unknown with grassroots conservative support, in June defeated House Majority Leader Eric Cantor after raising just $392,316 against the incumbent\u2019s $5.8 million.\n\nFour Democrats are also running for the seat.\n\nThey include Bobby McKenzie of Canton Township, who has worked for the U.S. State Department and the CIA in counter-terrorism, Anil Kumar, a urologist of Farmington, Nancy Skinner, an environmentalist and progressive radio personality of Birmingham and Bill Roberts, a political organizer from Livonia.\n\n13th District:\n\nU.S. Rep. John Conyers (D-Detroit), wants to be sent to Washington for a 26th term at 84 years old and is facing a challenge from Rev. Horace Sheffield III of Detroit.\n\nConyers, as did Evans in the county executive race, survived a court challenge questioning his eligibility based on filing technicalities that nearly kept him off the ballot.\n\n8th and 12th districts\n\nU.S. Rep Mike Rogers (R-Howell) is leaving politics for a radio show and the longest serving congressman ever Rep. John Dingell (D-Dearborn) is retiring.\n\nTwo well-known Republicans have emerged to seek Rogers\u2019 seat: Former Senate Majority Leader Mike Bishop and State Rep. Tom McMillin. More on that race from MLive Lansing here.\n\nAnd two Democrats, Dingell\u2019s wife Debbie Dingell and Ypsilanti attorney Ray Mullins, are battling for the 12th District nomination. More on that race from MLive Ann Arbor here.\n\nState lawmakers battle\n\nThere are also races for seats in the state legislature in which there are no incumbents, leaving newcomers to battle it out, and others in which current lawmakers are trying to oust each other.\n\n4th Senate District:\n\nState Sen. Virgil Smith wants to stick around, but so does state Rep. Rashida Tlaib, who can\u2019t run for another term in the House and is seeking Smith\u2019s spot in the Senate.\n\nTlaib was popular in her House district, where she ran a neighborhood service center and fought hard for southwest Detroit residents on environmental issues and matters related to construction of a new bridge to Canada.\n\nBut she\u2019s up against an incumbent who\u2019s spent more time in the legislature, having represented Detroit in both chambers, and has the backing of the Detroit Regional Chamber.\n\nVoters on Tuesday will decide which Democrat to send to the November election and which to send packing.\n\n6th House District:\n\nMeanwhile, the House seat being left behind by Tlaib is being sought by a slew of fresh-faced community activists.\n\nThey are: Tyrone Carter, Stephanie Chang, Eze Ejelonu, Elena Herrada and Verl Jean Pittman, all of Detroit, and Patrick O'Connell and Casondria Walker Keith, both of Ecorse.\n\nMore\n\nSeveral other Senate races include multiple current and former House members seeking seats in the opposite chamber.\n\nState Rep. John Olumba (D-Detroit) is challenging state Sen. Bert Johnson (D-Detroit) in the 2nd District. Georgia Lemmons of Detroit and Taras Nykoriak of Hamtramck are also seeking the Democratic nomination.\n\nReps. Thomas Stallworth (D- Detroit), David Knezek (D-Dearborn Heights) and David Nathan (D-Detroit), former state Rep. Shanelle Jackson and Frank Tomcsik of Redford Township are all running to replace the term-limited Sen. Tupac Hunter in the 5th District.\n\nIn Oakland County, State Reps. Ellen Cogen Lipton (D-Huntington Woods) and Vicki Barnett (D-Farmington Hills) are both challenging 11th District Sen. Vincent Gregory (D-Lathrup Village).\n\nAnd Former Republican state Reps. Marty Knollenberg, Chuck Moss and Andrew \u201cRocky\u201d Raczkowski, along with attorney Ethan Baker and Al Gui of Royal Oak are all vying to replace term-limited Sen. John Pappageorge in the 13th District.\n\nPreview what your ballot looks like and learn more about the candidates through MLive\u2019s Voter Guide here.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"article_author": "Khalil AlHajal | kalhajal@mlive.com", "medium": "news", "news_keywords": "all-detroit, michigan-2014-election, news", "title": "An election day guide to Metro Detroit's most heated races", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"An election day guide to Metro Detroit\\u0027s most heated races\", \"link\": \"http://www.mlive.com/news/detroit/index.ssf/2014/08/an_election_day_guide_to_metro.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://image.mlive.com/home/mlive-media/width620/img/news/detroit_impact/photo/15550281-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"13567110\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-08-05T12:27:33Z\", \"author\": \"Khalil AlHajal | kalhajal@mlive.com\", \"tags\": [\"@dt-33\",\"@dt-news\",\"@dt-river\",\"@mlive-politics\",\"@statewide\",\"all-detroit\",\"michigan-2014-election\"] }", "twitter": {"site": "@mlive", "image": "http://image.mlive.com/home/mlive-media/width620/img/news/detroit_impact/photo/15550281-standard.jpg", "description": "Turnout in Tuesday's primary election isn't expected to be high, but that doesn't mean the races aren't compelling and impactful toward the way state and federal government will be run.", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@detroitkhalil"}, "article_date_updated": "Tuesday, August 05, 2014,  8:26 AM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"short_title\": \"\", \"image_url\": \"http://media.mlive.com/news/detroit_impact/photo/election2014-8ef554ba20ea0dbc.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"KhalilAlHajal\", \"author_nickname\": \"Khalil AlHajal | kalhajal@mlive.com\", \"author_id\": \"8365464\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Detroit News\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.mlive.com/news/detroit/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "MLive.com", "description": "Turnout in Tuesday's primary election isn't expected to be high, but that doesn't mean the races aren't compelling and impactful toward the way state and federal government will be run.", "title": "An election day guide to Metro Detroit's most heated races", "url": "http://www.mlive.com/news/detroit/index.ssf/2014/08/an_election_day_guide_to_metro.html", "image": "http://image.mlive.com/home/mlive-media/width620/img/news/detroit_impact/photo/15550281-standard.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "MLive.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Tuesday, August 05, 2014,  8:00 AM", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "Description": "Turnout in Tuesday's primary election isn't expected to be high, but that doesn't mean the races aren't compelling and impactful toward the way state and federal government will be run."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf863\"", "article_summary": "State Rep.
