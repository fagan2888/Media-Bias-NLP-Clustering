Overall student health use \u0096 including both provider and nursing visits \u0096 is down 16 percent, from 34,660 in the 2011 budget year to 29,037 in the past budget year.\n\nAt the University of Northern Iowa, student health visits and transactions also are down year over year, while student health use at Iowa State University is on the rise. ISU officials credit the increase, in part, to a corresponding jump in overall student enrollment.\n\nIn Iowa City, UI student health officials said the declines could be due to a combination of factors, including fewer available providers, more over-the-counter treatment options, new technologies providing alternatives to doctor visits, and more off-site alternatives such as flu shot clinics.\n\n\u0093Our website has more information and places for questions, so they can use that as a means to not come in for a visit,\u0094 explained Kathleen Wittich, medical director for UI Student Health and Wellness.\n\nThe student health clinic also has fewer physicians and physician assistants in attendance than it did years ago, something UI officials are working to address.\n\n\u0093We are trying to ensure for patients who need or want advice or care, that we provide that care,\u0094 Wittich said.\n\n\"Looking to increase the numbers\"\n\nWhen students arrive at college, becoming familiar with the health care options isn\u0092t always a priority. But it could become one as soon as cold season strikes or as academic pressures mount, and student health officials are trying to spread awareness about the health care services on campus.\n\nStudent Health offers free and reduced-cost clinical and health services to students for anything from the common cold to nutrition counseling. Its primary medical care is just like that of any health care clinic, with board-certified physicians available to address \u0093almost any health concern.\u0094\n\nThe universities offer student health insurance policies, for those needing coverage. Officials at all three regent universities said it\u0092s too soon to know how the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act could affect student health visits.\n\n\u0093College might be the first time that the student has sought health care without the assistance of a family member,\u0094 Wittich said. \u0093So we are trying to help them navigate the system and encourage and promote good lifestyle habits.\u0094\n\nUI student health figures for \"additional services\" support the theory that health care alternatives and outreach programs are affecting clinic visits. Website hits, for example, jumped from 305,720 in the 2011 budget year to 392,232 in fiscal 2013.\n\nAnd contacts via outreach and workshops climbed from 19,450 in 2011 to 21,646 in 2013.\n\n\u0093But visits are always necessary,\u0094 Wittich said. \u0093There is no substitute for seeing someone in-person. Physicians are limited without seeing a person in front of them.\u0094\n\nA dip in available providers at UI Student Health also might be partly to blame for the decrease, said Jim Kellogg, director of UI Student Health and Wellness.\n\n\u0093We didn\u0092t have as much capacity as we would have liked,\u0094 Kellogg said. \u0093But now we are moving in the right direction.\u0094\n\nHe said the clinic remains one physician short of being fully staffed.\n\n\u0093But we hope to get that filled soon,\u0094 Kellogg said, adding that marketing also should help boost visits. \u0093Through advertising and outreach, we are looking to increase the numbers.\u0094\n\n\"We are certainly feeling it\"\n\nUI enrollment rose by 673 from the start of the 2010-11 academic year to the beginning of 2012-13 \u0097 which means student population fluctuations are not behind UI trends in student health use. But at ISU, officials said student numbers are at least partly connected to demand for student health services.\n\n\u0093This is our third year in a row with record enrollment,\u0094 said Michelle Hendricks, director of ISU\u0092s Student Health Center. \u0093And we are certainly feeling it.\u0094\n\nSo far this fall, student health center visits are up about 16 percent, Hendricks said. From the 2011-2012 academic year to the 2012-2013 year, total medical clinic visits increased 6.2 percent, according to ISU statistics.\n\nBut enrollment isn\u0092t the only factor that affects student health use, Hendricks noted. Seasonal illness rates also can drive numbers up.\n\n\u0093But clearly, with the growing student body, the expectation is that all our student services will be used at a higher rate,\u0094 Hendricks said. \u0093So we are tuned into that and planning for that.\u0094\n\nThe center is focused right now on optimizing staff \u0093to see as many students as we can.\u0094 Officials are looking for efficiencies, and even ways to expand, Hendricks said.\n\n\u0093We are using every square inch of the current facility,\u0094 Hendricks said.\n\nISU doesn\u0092t offer an online patient portal \u0096 such as MyChart for UI students \u0096 but Hendricks said its electronic medical record system has the capability. The goal, she said, is to have something up and running by next summer that would allow students to check test results online or communicate with a provider.\n\n\u0093That is at the top on our list of technology projects we want to pursue,\u0094 she said.\n\nISU student health staffers also use the website and social media to connect with students.\n\n\u0093We want them to know that we are here and we are available, and if they seek services early, we can help them prevent absences in school and help in their successful pursuit of education,\u0094 Hendricks said.\n\nThat\u0092s the sentiment at UNI, where student health use has seen a slight dip \u0096 such as its enrollment.\n\n\u0093To me, it\u0092s a direct correlation,\u0094 said Shelley Matthews, director of UNI\u0092s Student Health Clinic. \u0093We have fewer students, so we are going to see fewer students come into the clinic.\u0094\n\nMatthews said her staff offers online health tips and on-call nurse availability. But she doesn\u0092t think those services have much effect on UNI student visits. And she doesn\u0092t think they should.\n\n\u0093We highly encourage students to make an appointment if they\u0092re not feeling well,\u0094 she said.", "article_metadata": {"Description": "The Gazette | Judging by the symptoms, University of Iowa health consultant Trish Welter said she doesn\u0092t think the nosebleeds are serious.\u0093It sounds like your cold could be", "og": {"url": "http://www.thegazette.com/2013/10/25/university-of-iowa-students-paying-fewer-clinic-visits", "type": "article", "image": "http://www.thegazette.com/storyimage/GA/20131025/NEWS/310259998/EP/1/1/EP-310259998.jpg", "site_name": "The Gazette", "description": "Judging by the symptoms, University of Iowa health consultant Trish Welter said she doesn\u0092t think the nosebleeds are serious."}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thegazette.com/2013/10/25/university-of-iowa-students-paying-fewer-clinic-visits", "title": "University of Iowa students paying fewer clinic visits", "description": "Judging by the symptoms, University of Iowa health consultant Trish Welter said she doesn\u0092t think the nosebleeds are serious.", "site": "@gazettedotcom"}, "MobileOptimized": 320, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "bt": {"title": "University of Iowa students paying fewer clinic visits", "type": "thegazette_", "pubDate": "2013-10-25T03:30:00-05:00", "modDate": "2014-03-28T22:22:00-05:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 163646090334606}, "apple-touch-fullscreen": "yes", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd065a\"", "article_summary": "At the University of Northern Iowa, student health visits and transactions also are down year over year, while student health use at Iowa State University is on the rise.\nPhysicians are limited without seeing a person in front of them.\u0094A dip in available providers at UI Student Health also might be partly to blame for the decrease, said Jim Kellogg, director of UI Student Health and Wellness.\nFrom the 2011-2012 academic year to the 2012-2013 year, total medical clinic visits increased 6.2 percent, according to ISU statistics.\n\u0093To me, it\u0092s a direct correlation,\u0094 said Shelley Matthews, director of UNI\u0092s Student Health Clinic.\nStudent Health offers free and reduced-cost clinical and health services to students for anything from the common cold to nutrition counseling."}
