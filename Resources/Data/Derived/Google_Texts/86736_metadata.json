Renee Ellmers raised awareness of a new problem with Obamacare\u2019s implementation: the creation of private-sector health insurance monopolies that will limit Americans\u2019 provider choices.\n\nThe major health insurance company Blue Cross Blue Shield, which is closely coordinating with the White House on Obamacare implementation, will enjoy perhaps the greatest monopoly of all, the North Carolina Republican said in a statement.\n\n\u201cAlthough seven insurance companies currently operate in North Carolina, under the new Obamacare exchanges, those options will dwindle down to one in the majority of counties,\u201d Ellmers said Thursday following the disclosure of figures by federal health officials showing that more than 60 percent of North Carolina counties will have only one insurance provider option under Obamacare: Blue Cross Blue Shield.\n\n\u201cThe whole point of an online marketplace was to provide options, so North Carolinians could go online, compare prices, and choose plans from different companies. That is how competition is supposed to work!,\u201d Ellmers said.\n\nBeginning October 1 under Obamacare, Blue Cross Blue Shield will be the only health insurance provider serving the entire state of North Carolina in the new Obamacare exchanges, serving all 100 of the state\u2019s counties. Its competitor Coventry Health Care, which is owned by Aetna, will only reach 39 counties.\n\nThat leaves 61 counties, or 61 percent of all the state\u2019s counties, in a Blue Cross Blue Shield-only zone.\n\nThe battle between Blue Cross and Aetna is waging across the country, and Blue Cross is winning.\n\nAetna has opted not to participate in Obamacare exchanges in numerous states including New York, Connecticut, Ohio, Maryland, Tennessee, and Texas.\n\nIn West Virginia, where Carelink Health Plans, run by Aetna-owned Coventry Health Care, withdrew from the state\u2019s Obamacare exchange, Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield will be the only available insurance provider for Obamacare consumers.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Patrick Howley", "description": "Rep.
