A seemingly unusual match came to light Friday when German chemical company BASF reached a deal to buy a small biotechnology company named Verenium Corp., sending Verenium’s shares soaring.

BASF /quotes/zigman/601736 DE:BAS said it would pay Verenium /quotes/zigman/114269 /quotes/nls/vrnm VRNM shareholders $4 in cash for each share they hold. That catapulted Verenium shares by nearly 60%, to $3.98 in recent action, up from $2.51.

It is unclear how Verenium will be merged in with BASF, which does have a pharmaceutical division. A BASF spokesman said in an email that it’s “too early in the process to provide specifics about the integration.”

But BASF said in a press release it is focusing on Verenium’s strong emphasis on enzyme development, which can accelerate biological and chemical processes. BASF didn’t respond to request for comments, but said in a press release that it would combined Verenium’s “scientific and technological excellence with BASF’s enzyme activities and its global access into all relevant markets will strengthen BASF’s footprint in the strategic enzyme growth market.”

BASF goes on to say that the enzymes can be used in a variety of applications, including the making of detergents, as well as human and animal nutrition. San Diego-based Verenium’s emphasis on industrial biotechnology fits well with BASF’s plans, as the company also has worked in grain processing and oilseed processing.

With an estimated 13 million Verenium shares outstanding, the deal is worth roughly $52 million.
