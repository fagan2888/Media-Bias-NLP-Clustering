We might well start see more travelers with illnesses. Having to sort out exactly what\u2019s going on with those travelers will be a challenge.\"\n\nWindham Representative Susan Johnson, the committee's co-chairman, said lawmakers want to determine whether there are any weaknesses in the current policies, and if they need to pass new legislation when the General Assembly convenes in January.\n\nGovernor Dannel Malloy signed an executive order in October giving the state's public health commissioner the ability to quarantine people who may have been exposed to or infected with the potentially deadly virus.\n\nWatch CT-N's footage of the hearing below:\n\nThis report includes information from The Associated Press.
