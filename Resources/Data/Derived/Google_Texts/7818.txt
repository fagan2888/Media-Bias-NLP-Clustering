Today is the last and final day to file 2014 income tax returns.

According to the IRS, they have received more than 120 million tax returns, and they expect to process 150 million by the end of tax season.

"It's something I'm not a fan of," said Rudy Roybal, who waited until the deadline to mail in his tax returns.

Roybal dreads the process, and says he waits until April 14th or 15th every year.

"It's an added burden on me as a business owner and I think I just wait until the last minute to get it done," said Roybal

Data from the IRS says that 23 million returns are filed through the mail, down 7% from last year.

"Today I don't see anybody in line, so everybody must have gotten their taxes in," said Roybal, who noticed the post office downtown wasn’t hectic like previous years.

While most Americans already filed their taxes electronically or by mail at this point, time is almost out for those who waited until the deadline.

"There are still those people that are filing on the last day and that's fine, that's why we’re staying open late," said Andrew Heatley with Jackson Hewitt of Western Colorado.

Jackson Hewitt Tax Service will be open until 10 pm or until the last customer is done filing their taxes.

"You have until midnight to e-file and then of course your return has to be post marked by today - by midnight," says Heatley.

Another change Roybal noticed on his tax forms this year was a result from the Affordable Care Act.

"You have to certify that you have health insurance or pay a penalty," said Roybal.

The penalties aren’t cheap. "1% of your annual household or $95 per person," said Heatley. Next year, the penalties will go up to 2% or $325 per person in a household.
