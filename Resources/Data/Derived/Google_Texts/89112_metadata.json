Cohen, who was not directly responsible for HealthCare.gov, replied that his earlier optimism had been based on staff reports.\n\nAt a January hearing, two House of Representative Republicans told him point blank that he should be fired.\n\nBut Tavenner's March 5 email to CMS staff described Cohen's March 31 departure at the end of the open enrollment period as amicable.\n\n\"I asked Gary to make the personal sacrifice of moving to the East Coast and leaving his family to lead CCIIO. I am very grateful to Gary for his service and knew that the time would come when he would return home. He says that time is at the end of open enrollment,\" Tavenner wrote.\n\nHis temporary replacement is Dr. Mandy Cohen, a physician who currently heads the insurance oversight agency's consumer support group.\n\n(Reporting by David Morgan; Editing by Leslie Adler)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Reuters Editorial", "Author": "Reuters Editorial", "DCSext.PageNumber": 1, "twitter": {"description": "A top U.S. healthcare official, accused by Republicans of misleading Congress about the readiness of the Obamacare rollout, will resign from his post at the end of March, officials said on Thursday.", "title": "U.S. official in charge of Obamacare exchanges resigns", "image": "http://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20140306&t=2&i=855704868&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=CBREA251QUR00", "creator": "@Reuters", "site": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "DCSext.rChannel": "Article -
