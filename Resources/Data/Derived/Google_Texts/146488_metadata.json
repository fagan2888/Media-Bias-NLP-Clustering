There is no better example of this than Robert Wells, a man addicted to drinking other people\u2019s urine, particularly from young children.\n\nA main component of addiction, as listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders is \u201ccontinued use of drug despite harm.\u201d For Wells, his addiction led him to be slapped with a child sex-offender charge, and he's now facing five years in prison, Gawker reported. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe they had created a charge like that out of collecting urine,\u201d said Wells in a clip from Investigation Discovery\u2019s My Strange Criminal Addiction.\n\nStill, despite these harsh consequences, Wells' behavior persists. His fascination with urine is not sexually based but built around a strange fantasy that drinking the urine of children will prevent him from ever aging. To be noted, there is absolutely no scientific evidence that anything will keep a person looking forever youthful. It\u2019s unclear where Wells originally got the idea for his take on the fountain of youth.\n\n\u201cRobert is not a pedophile. Robert has a delusional belief. His end game is the urine. That is really all he wants,\u201d Dr. Mike Dow, an addiction specialist, explained in the clip.\n\nWells lusts for the freshest batch of urine in the same way a drug addict would desire the best and purest hit. The middle-aged man admits to knowing that going out to collect urine from unknowing, and most importantly underage \u201cdonors,\u201d was morally wrong. Unfortunately, like other addicts, this is not enough to keep him from satisfying his urges.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "strange, addiction, man, drinks, young, peoples, urine, because, he, believes, it, keeps, him", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Robert Wells is addicted to drinking the urine of young people because he believes it will keep him \"forever young.\"", "title": "Man Drinks Young People's Pee Because He Believes It Prevents Aging [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/strange-addiction-man-drinks-young-peoples-urine-because-he-believes-it-keeps-him-312642", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/01/wells.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Robert Wells is addicted to drinking the urine of young people because he believes it will keep him \"forever young.\"", "title": "Man Drinks Young People's Pee Because He Believes It Prevents Aging [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/strange-addiction-man-drinks-young-peoples-urine-because-he-believes-it-keeps-him-312642", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/01/wells.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/01/wells.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Weird Medicine", "published_time": "2014-12-01T17:00:54-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-01T17:00:53-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Robert Wells is addicted to drinking the urine of young people because he believes it will keep him \"forever young.\""}, "article_summary": "There is no better example of this than Robert Wells, a man addicted to drinking other people\u2019s urine, particularly from young children.\nThe middle-aged man admits to knowing that going out to collect urine from unknowing, and most importantly underage \u201cdonors,\u201d was morally wrong.\nHis fascination with urine is not sexually based but built around a strange fantasy that drinking the urine of children will prevent him from ever aging.\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t believe they had created a charge like that out of collecting urine,\u201d said Wells in a clip from Investigation Discovery\u2019s My Strange Criminal Addiction.\nWells lusts for the freshest batch of urine in the same way a drug addict would desire the best and purest hit."}
