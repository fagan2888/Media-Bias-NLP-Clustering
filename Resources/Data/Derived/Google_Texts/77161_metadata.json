She said Texas endured a similar, long-period drought \u201cuntil Governor Perry signed the fetal pain bill.\u201d Assuming this \u201cpain bill\u201d refers to the Texas House Bill, or HB 2, this bill requires state abortion providers to emulate hospital-style surgical centers. As a result, most of the state\u2019s abortion clinics will close.\n\nNot only did Perry show his support for HB 2, but it also rained that night \u2014 so to Grove, this means anti-abortion legislation and God are what improved Texas\u2019 drought.\n\nJezebel added that Grove backpedaled on her Facebook page as she replied to a commenter who posted a story concerning her comments.\n\n\u201cI believe \u2014 and most Americans believe \u2014 that God\u2019s hand is in the affairs of man, and certainly was in the formation of this country.\u201d Grove wrote. \u201cThe Founders put God in the center of this nation by recognizing Him as a giver of our rights. Is this drought caused by God? Nobody knows. But biblical history shows a consequence to man\u2019s actions; we do know for sure that California\u2019s water shortage crisis has been compounded by liberal politicians\u2019 poor decisions \u2014 not properly managing our water resources and refusing to build water storage for decades.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, California regulators have ordered more than 100 growers and irrigation districts to stop sourcing from \u201cdrought-starved rivers and streams in the Central Valley,\u201d the Los Angeles Times reported. In January, Governor Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency, and he urges Californians to keep with measures in place in order to see relief, which is currently projected to be about a year from now.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "california, drought, gods, punishment, abortions, assemblywoman, says", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Shannon Grove is in the hot seat for comments she made about California's drought, suggesting God forgives devastating conditions following anti-abortion legislation.", "title": "Abortion Caused The California Drought: Assemblywoman", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/california-drought-gods-punishment-abortions-assemblywoman-says-338082", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/06/13/shannon-grove.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Shannon Grove is in the hot seat for comments she made about California's drought, suggesting God forgives devastating conditions following anti-abortion legislation.", "title": "Abortion Caused The California Drought: Assemblywoman", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/california-drought-gods-punishment-abortions-assemblywoman-says-338082", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/06/13/shannon-grove.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/06/13/shannon-grove.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Hill", "published_time": "2015-06-13T12:35:28-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-13T12:35:25-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Shannon Grove is in the hot seat for comments she made about California's drought, suggesting God forgives devastating conditions following anti-abortion legislation."}, "article_summary": "California assemblywoman Shannon Grove suggested this week abortion is the reason for California\u2019s devastating drought.\nJezebel reported Grove said so during a legislative banquet last week in Sacramento; Grove herself represents Kern County in The Golden State.\n\u201cThe Founders put God in the center of this nation by recognizing Him as a giver of our rights.\nShe said Texas endured a similar, long-period drought \u201cuntil Governor Perry signed the fetal pain bill.\u201d Assuming this \u201cpain bill\u201d refers to the Texas House Bill, or HB 2, this bill requires state abortion providers to emulate hospital-style surgical centers.\n\u201cI believe \u2014 and most Americans believe \u2014 that God\u2019s hand is in the affairs of man, and certainly was in the formation of this country.\u201d Grove wrote."}
