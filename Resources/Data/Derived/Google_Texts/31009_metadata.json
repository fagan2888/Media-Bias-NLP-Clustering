From the Post:\n\n[The president] seems to be falling into the same trap as other Democrats, and some reporters, by assuming that everyone in the Medicaid list is getting health insurance for the first time because of the Affordable Care Act. But that number is nowhere close to 7 million. It could be as low as 1.1 million (Avalere) or as high as 2.6 million (Gaba.) If one wanted to be generous, one could include people coming out of the woodwork, even though they would have been covered under the old law, but no one is really sure what that figure is. In any case, no matter how you slice it, it does not add up to 7 million.\n\n\u2013\n\nFollow Becket Adams (@BecketAdams) on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "gplus-count": 13, "twitter": {"description": "The Washington Post\u2019s fact checker on Monday awarded President Barack Obama with a flunking grade for claiming recently that approximately 7 million Americans now have \u201caccess to health care for the first time because of Medicaid expansion.\u201d  The president\u2019s claim, which the Post awarded four Pinocchio\u2019s, was made...", "title": "The Latest Obama Claim to Receive \u2018Four Pinocchios\u2019 by Washington Post Fact-Checker", "url": "http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2014/02/24/the-latest-obama-claim-to-receive-four-pinocchios-by-washington-post-fact-checker/", "image": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/barack-obama-getty-620x419.jpg", "creator": "@BecketAdams", "site": "@theblaze", "card": "summary", "account_id": 1512944287}, "keywords": "latest, obama, claim, receive, four, pinocchios, by, washington, post, fact, checker", "sailthru.tags": "business, government, medicaid, obamacare, politics, washington-post, author-becket-adams, site-theblazecom", "facebook-count": 1278, "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "msapplication-TileColor": "#282b2d", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/wide310x150.png", "categories": "medicaid,obamacare,washington-post,business,government,politics", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/medium150x150.png", "comment-count": 168, "description": "The Washington Post\u2019s fact checker on Monday awarded President Barack Obama with a flunking grade for claiming recently that approximately 7 million Americans now have \u201caccess to health care for the first time because of Medicaid expansion.\u201d  The president\u2019s claim, which the Post awarded four Pinocchio\u2019s, was made...", "sailthru.guid": "theblazecom/770117", "linkedin-count": 3, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/small70x70.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/large310x310.png", "fb": {"admins": 517831498}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.theblaze.com/", "viewport": "width=device-width", "og": {"site_name": "The Blaze", "description": "The Washington Post\u2019s fact checker on Monday awarded President Barack Obama with a flunking grade for claiming recently that approximately 7 million Americans now have \u201caccess to health care for the first time because of Medicaid expansion.\u201d  The president\u2019s claim, which the Post awarded four Pinocchio\u2019s, was made...", "title": "The Latest Obama Claim to Receive \u2018Four Pinocchios\u2019 by Washington Post Fact-Checker", "url": "http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2014/02/24/the-latest-obama-claim-to-receive-four-pinocchios-by-washington-post-fact-checker/", "image": {"width": 620, "identifier": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/barack-obama-getty-620x419.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 419}, "type": "article"}, "dc.date": "2014-02-24T20:00:17+00:00", "twitter-count": 466}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddfb2\"", "article_summary": "It could be as low as 1.1 million (Avalere) or as high as 2.6 million (Gaba.)\n\u201cThe Congressional Budget Office estimates that because of the ACA, the number of Americans on Medicaid will increase by 8 million in 2014,\u201d the Post reported, noting that Medicaid figure was revised downward recently from 9 million.\nIn any case, no matter how you slice it, it does not add up to 7 million.\nThe Medicaid figures come by way of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which is division of the Department of Health and Human Services.\nFurther, Avalere, a health-consulting firm, recently challenged DHS\u2019 numbers, estimating that Obamacare can take credit for only 1.1 million to 1.8 million of the claimed enrollees."}
