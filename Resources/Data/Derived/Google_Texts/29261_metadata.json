Half will be ready by midweek and the rest in coming days.\n\n\u201cThis is a catalyst site to get redevelopment going along Norwich Street,\u201d said developer Bill Gross of the W.H. Gross Construction Co.\n\nThe $8 million development consists of 52 units and was financed by Gross through a state and federal tax credit program. Gross sold off some of the tax credits to major corporations to raise money to fund the project. He bought the abandoned school yard from the city for $487,000 and began construction last summer. As work progressed, the project gained momentum and will open with a full house.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re 100 percent leased with a waiting list,\u201d Gross said.\n\nThe north Brunswick area along Norwich has been called blighted, with post-World War II homes, many of them beyond repair, and rundown commercial storefronts packed tightly together. The old C.B. Greer Elementary School occupied the site until a couple of years ago when it was torn down to make way for Norwich Commons.\n\nCity Manager Bill Weeks said the project has generated excitement and hope for the future of the area.\n\n\u201cThis is turning out better than I anticipated,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a quality job and will spur improvements throughout the whole neighborhood.\u201d\n\nThe city put one requirement on Gross at the outset \u2014 to keep the school\u2019s gym for the use of residents.\n\nIt has been turned into a community center, with an area for exercise, a police substation, a library and computer room.\n\nIn addition to affordable rents, the units are designed to reduce the utility bills of residents.\n\nThe buildings are designed to meet EarthCraft standards, Gross said, which include energy efficiency, water conservation and low maintenance. They also will comply with the American With Disabilities Act. The Craftsman architectural style dates from the 1940s.\n\nThe complex also has Brunswick\u2019s first underground system to collect stormwater runoff and let it percolate slowly into the groundwater rather than dumping it into the city system, Gross said.\n\nThe system won\u2019t catch it all and during extremely heavy rains it will overflow into the city storm water drainage, but it will be help the environment, Gross said.\n\nGross said he had expected an earlier opening for the complex but progress was slowed when his company was forced to replace water and sewer lines serving the site.\n\n\u201cYou know how they talk about the crumbling infrastructure of the country? This is a perfect example,\u201d he said.\n\nThe public suffered with Gross with the traffic on Fourth Street having to detour around the block for months.\n\nTimes-Union Georgia Editor Terry Dickson contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "BRUNSWICK | Workers were putting the finishing touches this week on a multifamily housing complex on the grounds of an old elementary school.Driveways and sidewalks were being poured and landscaping finished off in anticipation of the July 1 occupancy date for Norwich Commons, a public-private venture meant to provide affordable housing to working families and spark a resurgence of a blighted neighborhood on the northern edge of town.
