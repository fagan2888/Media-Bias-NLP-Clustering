There was nothing illegal found during the search, but the girl was absolutely traumatized by the incident.\n\nThe school is entirely unapologetic, and insists that the procedure was done \u201crespectfully,\u201d as if you could possibly force someone to remove their clothes against their will in a respectful manner.\n\nQuebec Education Minister Yves Bolduc made a statement defending the school this week. Bolduc said that it is perfectly fine to strip search students if they are suspected of holding drugs, so long as the procedure is done respectfully and \u201cby the book.\u201d\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\n\u201cIt is permitted to do strip searches, on one condition: it must be very respectful. There are reasons for which we can be obliged to conduct searches. What\u2019s important is that we respect the law and respect the framework that was put in place (for searching students) and respect the person,\u201d Bolduc said in a statement this week.\n\nHowever, children\u2019s advocacy groups are outraged about the molestation that occurred, as well as the reaction from officials in the school system.\n\n\u201cIt was completely, completely wrong to say that it\u2019s OK to force a teenager to get nude just because the principal thinks that maybe she has some drugs on her. And I would have thought that the minister would stop this and say it\u2019s wrong. But no, no, he said it\u2019s good and there\u2019s no problem with this,\u201d Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Roberge of The Coalition Avenir said.\n\nJohn Vibes is an author, researcher and investigative journalist who takes a special interest in the counter culture and the drug war.
