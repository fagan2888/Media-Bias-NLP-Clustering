Poling, general counsel for the Government Accountability Office, in a memo to members of Congress this month.\n\nThat\u2019s a lot of jargon, but what Poling concluded is Congress has to specifically appropriate funds for the \u201crisk corridor\u201d program starting in 2015 as part of the annual budget bill for CMS.\n\n\u201cThis is a very positive development towards protecting taxpayers from the unlimited liability to which Obamacare exposes us,\u201d concludes John R. Graham, a senior fellow with the National Center for Policy Analysis, who has closely followed the debate over the risk corridor program.\n\nHere\u2019s why it matters.\n\nWhile the crashing exchange websites, the cancellation of existing health insurance plans and the American public\u2019s sinking opinion of the ACA have received most of the headlines, the risk corridors program has been the subject of much behind-the-scenes debate during Obamacare\u2019s fitful first year.\n\nSpecifically, Congress has been interested in two questions: Does the risk corridor program have to be cost-neutral? And, if it is not, does it require a congressional appropriation.\n\nLet\u2019s take the first question first.\n\nAccording to Edmund Haislmairer, a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, there are three major provisions of the ACA designed to protect insurance companies from losing money.\n\nFirst, there is a re-insurance program \u2014 think about re-insurance as insurance for insurance companies, or meta-insurance \u2014 funded by a temporary tax on all health insurance policies. It\u2019s expected to collect and redistribute about $20 billion during the ACA\u2019s first three years.\n\nSecond, there is a \u201crisk adjustment program\u201d that basically allows insurers to share funds based on how many high-cost enrollees they get. It is a permanent provision of the ACA.\n\nThird, there is the tricky \u201crisk corridor\u201d program that allows to government to take money from insurance companies that make higher profits and pay insurance companies that fall into the red.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that the first two programs, despite the fact one is temporary and one is permanent, simply re-allocate money already within the insurance system. They are zero-sum games that don\u2019t require any new funds.\n\nTo understand why the third program is different, consider the following hypothetical situation: assume no insurance company makes a profit determined by the government to be excessive \u2014 indeed, the existence of a provision allowing the government to seize excessive profits gives them a pretty good incentive to avoid doing so \u2014 but some companies end up with what the government terms \u201cexcessive losses.\u201d\n\nWhere does the government get the money to refund those insurance companies for their losses?\n\nGraham points out the Obama administration promised, during the Obamacare debates in 2010, the risk corridors would be cost-neutral, but there\u2019s nothing written into the law requiring them to be that way.\n\nThat brings us to the second question: if the risk corridors are not cost-neutral, where does the government get the extra dollars?\n\nThat\u2019s where the GAO\u2019s report from last week enters the picture. Responding to a request from members of Congress, the GAO said the dollars to fill that gap would have to come from congressional appropriations. In other words, if there\u2019s going to be an Obamacare insurance company bailout, Congress would have to approve.\n\n\u201cAgencies may incur obligations and make expenditures only as permitted by an appropriation,\u201d wrote Poling in the GAO analysis.\n\nDuring the spring, the Obama administration finalized a rulemaking that actually increases taxpayers\u2019 exposure to the \u201crisk corridors\u201d bailout scenario, essentially by widening the range of profit losses that could be recouped through the program, according to Graham.\n\nThat rule, he says, \u201ctakes a small but significant step toward abandoning the fantasy of budget neutrality,\u201d when it comes to the risk corridors. It makes it all the more important Congress does its best to \u201censure our liabilities in the risk corridors are limited and precisely quantified.\u201d\n\nSo, Congress might be able to stop the ACA bailout from happening, or at least limit the damage. Here\u2019s the catch: health insurers have lots of lobbyists \u2014 and they also have a powerful interest in making sure they don\u2019t lose millions of dollars because of Obamacare.\n\nIt\u2019s also possible \u2014 though unlikely, given the incentive to avoid excessive profits \u2014 that many companies will generate high profits and none will have losses. Then, Haislmairer points out, the program would have a surplus of funds and no where to spend them.\n\nOf course, that\u2019s a much better problem to have.\n\nBoehm can be reached at EBoehm@Watchdog.org and follow @EricBoehm87 on Twitter for more.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Insurance companies made out pretty well with the passage of Obamacare, but Congress could stop them from getting bailed out by the federal government.", "title": "Insurance companies can\u2019t get Obamacare bailout unless Congress approves - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/07/obamacare.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-11-07T15:23:45+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/175916/obamacare-bailout-congress-gao/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Accountability", "tag": "ACA,Affordable Care Act,Bailout,Congress,Federal Government,finances,Health insurance,insurance companies,Obama,ObamaCare,risk corridors,Taxpayers", "published_time": "2014-10-08T10:54:57+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-07T15:23:45+00:00"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Insurance companies made out pretty well with the passage of Obamacare, but Congress could stop them from getting bailed out by the federal government.", "title": "Insurance companies can\u2019t get Obamacare bailout unless Congress approves - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/07/obamacare.jpg"}, "creator": "@ericboehm87", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "description": "Insurance companies made out pretty well with the passage of Obamacare, but Congress could stop them from getting bailed out by the federal government."}, "article_summary": "The sweet deal for insurance companies is a sour one for taxpayers: forced to buy insurance companies\u2019 services up front (and paying higher premiums to do it), forced to bail out failing insurance companies on the back-end.\nFirst, there is a re-insurance program \u2014 think about re-insurance as insurance for insurance companies, or meta-insurance \u2014 funded by a temporary tax on all health insurance policies.\nThird, there is the tricky \u201crisk corridor\u201d program that allows to government to take money from insurance companies that make higher profits and pay insurance companies that fall into the red.\nAccording to Edmund Haislmairer, a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, there are three major provisions of the ACA designed to protect insurance companies from losing money.\nIn other words, if there\u2019s going to be an Obamacare insurance company bailout, Congress would have to approve."}
