The New York Fed\u2019s Empire State Manufacturing Survey shows July factory activity expanding significantly.\n\nA cautionary note, however, comes from Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen who told Congressional lawmakers that the recovery is not over because unemployment remains high.\n\nHowever, if labor markets continue improving at a faster clip than anticipated, the United States Central Bank might consider raising interest rates sooner and quicker.\n\nUnemployment in June fell to a six year low of 6.1 percent. For the fifth straight month, more than 200,000 jobs were added.\n\nThe good news for core sales is that consumer spending rose .06 percent in June and May\u2019s numbers (which were initially reported as flat) actually rose .02 percent. Sporting goods, electronics and appliances were popular items for consumers.\n\nCore sales most closely reflect the consumer spending component included in the annual Gross Domestic Product, and excludes automobile, gasoline, building materials and food services. Sales of building materials and gardening equipment fell in June about 1 percent.\n\nBased on 2nd quarter improvements, forecasters with Macro Economic Advisors project an annual 3 percent growth rate in GDP for the year. Goldman Sachs increased its annual GDP projection to 3.4 percent.\n\nOther signs of a better economic outlook, as reported in the Empire State survey, are June increases in manufacturing employment and hours worked weekly.\n\n\u201cConsumers will likely gain more confidence to spend as the job market improves and summer travel season hits full swing,\u201d says Randy Hopper, credit cards vice president of Navy Federal Credit Union in Vienna, Virginia.\n\n\u201cWe are optimistic that the second half of the year will deliver stronger sales growth,\u201d says Hopper in an article by Reuters.\n\nAccording to the Empire State survey, the index on general business conditions is 25.68, a 4-year high with 41 percent of respondents seeing improvements and 15 percent saying conditions were worse.\n\nBut there are lingering worries. The same survey found optimism for future growth declined in June. The index for future general business conditions fell 11 points to 28.5; future new orders fell nine points to 25.6, and future shipments dropped 21 points to 24.6.\n\nGet Free Updates!
