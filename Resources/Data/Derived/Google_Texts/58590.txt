Langone insisted that Washington's targeting of big Wall Street banks has the financial services industry on the ropes.

"One of the great challenges going forward is how do we restore the elegance of the banks that young people want to go there, want to work there to pursue their careers there," Langone said. "The essence of business to me is great people run great companies. Mediocre people don't do a very good job."

"Why in the hell does a kid whose lost an arm or a leg or a faceâ€”why does that person have to be paraded on television...so they can appeal to you to send $19 a month to help this man, whose every need should be taken care of by all of us and every American?" Langone said. "We give billions of dollars a year to people who do nothing."
