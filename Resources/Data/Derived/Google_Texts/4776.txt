MANAUS, Brazil (AP) — Cristiano Ronaldo is expected to play for Portugal against the United States at the World Cup on Sunday despite a left knee injury.

Portugal midfielder Raul Meireles says Ronaldo is “fit to play. That’s all I can say.”

On Friday at the team’s training base in Campinas, Ronaldo again wore a brace on his troublesome left knee.

With Ronaldo healthy, the Portuguese would be favored to beat the Americans and give themselves a chance to advance to the second round after an opening loss to Germany. But without the world player of the year, Portugal is facing the very real possibility of an early exit from Group G.
