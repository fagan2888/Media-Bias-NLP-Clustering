UPDATE: Sunday, October 20, 2013

A 28-year-old man is recovering at a Wichita hospital following a shooting early Sunday morning at a party on the city's east side.

The shooting happened around 1 a.m. outside of a residence in the 800 block of South Erie, near Lincoln and Hillside.

While Elaine Spencer-Robertson was putting Halloween decorations in her yard, she says what sounded like a normal party down the street at first suddenly made her want to call for help.

“It got louder and then we heard panic screaming and then I said I’m calling 911 because that kind of screaming seemed more like people fighting,” Elaine Spencer-Robertson said.

While she was on the phone with 911, Elaine says she heard gunshots ring out.

“When the first one went off it sounded like a firework and then it was like Pow! Pow! Pow! Pow! Pow!" Spencer-Robertson said.

She watched as everyone at the party, started running for safety -

'”People were panicking, screaming, running. People were saying 'Calm down, Calm down. Put it away, put it away,' and I was actually scared because I didn't know if people were going to be running this way and I’ve got two little ones in the house,” Spencer-Robertson said.

Police tell us a group of 4 or 5 men showed up to a party on south Erie. They weren't invited by the homeowner. Somehow a fight broke out and one of the men went to a car, grabbed a gun, and fired into the crowd.

One man was shot in the head but he's actually already out of the hospital. We spoke with him but he didn't want to be identified because the shooter is still on the loose.

“Several people were witnesses to the shooting and we do have some good leads. We are working on those right now,” Sgt. Brad Elmore with the Wichita Police Department said.

No arrests have been made.

One other person suffered minor injuries in the scuffle and was treated at the scene.
