NEW YORK (AP) â€” Disney has found its latest princess: 14-year-old native Hawaiian Auli'i Cravalho (aw-LEE'-ee crah-VOHL'-oh).

Cravalho was announced Wednesday as the star of Disney's upcoming animated adventure "Moana." To cast the voice role, Disney auditioned hundreds throughout the Pacific Islands.

"Moana," due out November next year, is about a teenager who sails through the South Pacific to a fabled island. Dwayne Johnson has already been cast to voice the demi-god Maui.

The film, directed by Ron Clements and John Musker, will feature music written by Lin-Manuel Miranda, creator of the Broadway sensation "Hamilton."

Casting director Rachel Sutton said the newcomer Cravalho was the last audition she saw.
