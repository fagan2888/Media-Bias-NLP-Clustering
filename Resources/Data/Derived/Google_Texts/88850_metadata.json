It\u2019s not his worldview,\u201d telling Goldberg, \u201cI\u2019ve sat in too many rooms with the president. He\u2019s thoughtful, he\u2019s incredibly smart, and able to analyze a lot of different factors that are all moving at the same time. I think he is cautious because he knows what he inherited.\u201d\n\nSince releasing her new memoir in June, Clinton has slowly taken steps away from her former boss\u2019s positions. The tactic appears to be intentional: Obama's poll numbers are slipping and Clinton, who is widely considered the frontrunner for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016, needs to separate herself from the negative numbers.\n\nThe first split with Obama came during the Syria chapter of her book \"Hard Choices,\" where Clinton articulates that she and the President disagreed on how to handle the \"wicked problem\" of arming Syrian rebels.\n\nThe \u201crisks of both action and inaction were high. Both choices would bring unintended consequences. The President's inclination was to stay the present course and not take the significant further step of arming rebels,\" she wrote. \"No one likes to lose a debate, including me. But this was the President's call and I respected his deliberations and decision.\"\n\nIn her interview with The Atlantic, Clinton went further than she does in her book and called the inaction in Syria a \"failure.\"\n\n\"The failure to help build up a credible fighting force of the people who were the originators of the protests against Assad - there were Islamists, there were secularists, there was everything in the middle - the failure to do that left a big vacuum, which the jihadists have now filled,\" Clinton said.\n\nDuring her time as secretary of state, Clinton advocated arming and vetting rebel groups fighting against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Obama, however, disagreed early in the conflict and the United States began arming the rebels in September 2013, after Clinton had left the State Department.\n\nDuring the interview with The Atlantic, Clinton appears to put herself in between Obama and former President George W. Bush on military intervention.\n\n\"You know, when you\u2019re down on yourself, and when you are hunkering down and pulling back, you\u2019re not going to make any better decisions than when you were aggressively, belligerently putting yourself forward,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cOne issue is that we don\u2019t even tell our own story very well these days.\"\n\nIn July, a top White House aide said he didn't think Clinton was \u201ctrying to distance herself\" from Obama.\n\nDan Pfeiffer, a longtime Obama aide and senior adviser, said the White House doesn't \"assume that the Secretary Clinton or anyone else must agree 100% with the president on every single decision that he has ever made.\"\n\nAccording to a White House official, people close to Clinton gave Obama aides a heads-up about the interview.\n\nThe official went on to say that the White House is not getting amped up over Clinton's interview. They don't see this as her break-away moment, according to the source, though they anticipate she will move away from Obama over time.\n\nIn addition to her breaking with Obama in her memoir, Clinton has used the book tour to draw more stark divisions.\n\n\"Every party in the White House has the responsibility during the time it\u2019s there to do the best we can, to lead and manage the many problems we face. And I think we did that in the first term,\" Clinton said last month in an interview with NPR. The answer, notably, did not include all of Obama's presidency in the answer.\n\nOn working and partnering with Obama in Iraq - something that was floated by the Obama administration - Clinton said in July that she was \"not prepared\" to work with Iran.\n\n\"I am not prepared to say that we go in with Iran right now, until we have a better idea what we're getting ourselves into,\" Clinton said during a CNN town hall.\n\nCNN Senior White House Correspondent Jim Acosta contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "(CNN) -- Hillary Clinton, President Barack Obama's first secretary of state, dramatically distanced herself from the President's approach to foreign policy in an interview published Sunday.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "title": "Hillary Clinton splits with Obama on foreign policy", "og": {"url": "http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2014/08/10/hillary-clinton-splits-with-obama-on-foreign-policy/", "image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/140811194808-pkg-keilar-iraq-obama-clinton-foreign-policy-00004824-horizontal-gallery.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "(CNN) -- Hillary Clinton, President Barack Obama's first secretary of state, dramatically distanced herself from the President's approach to foreign policy in an interview published Sunday.", "title": "Hillary Clinton splits with Obama on foreign policy"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "- All politics, all the time", "fb": {"admins": 690014395, "app_id": 80401312489}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CNN Political Ticker", "keywords": "foreign policy, hillary clinton, president obama, by cnn's dan merica", "google-site-verification": "mFBa4OnyEDU23vgVJ6rtX_4izud7FIi9JiscfVsWaKk", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcee64\"", "article_summary": "In July, a top White House aide said he didn't think Clinton was \u201ctrying to distance herself\" from Obama.\n2 years ago(CNN) - Hillary Clinton, President Barack Obama's first secretary of state, dramatically distanced herself from the President's approach to foreign policy in an interview published Sunday.\nCNN Senior White House Correspondent Jim Acosta contributed to this report.\nAccording to a White House official, people close to Clinton gave Obama aides a heads-up about the interview.\n\"Great nations need organizing principles, and \u2018Don\u2019t do stupid stuff\u2019 is not an organizing principle,\" Clinton told The Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg, knocking the Obama administration's foreign policy."}
