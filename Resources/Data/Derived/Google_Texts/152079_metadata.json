ACA's next obstacle: Confused users\n\nObama administration officials hoping to exhale after the big finish to Obamacare\u2019s first enrollment season may need to hold their breath a while longer.\n\nAll the confusion and mixed messages out there are bound to combust if people decide they were misled \u2014 an echo of the \u201cyou can keep your plan if you like it\u201d fiasco.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s been a failing with the Obama administration [communication], it\u2019s the failure to adequately plan for that kind of extensive, repeated interaction with people at the community level,\u201d said Larry Jacobs, an expert on health politics at the University of Minnesota. Successful outreach doesn\u2019t depend on just one jingle, he stressed. \u201cIt\u2019s repeated and unceasing outreach at multiple levels.\u201d\n\n( CARTOONS: Matt Wuerker on Obamacare)\n\nSome of the missed points and mixed-up details could bite the administration almost immediately as people start using their new plans and blame surprises on the White House. Other lingering public misconceptions could feed Republican attacks through the November midterm elections.\n\nHere are six big danger points.\n\n1. I\u2019m sick! Why can\u2019t I get covered?\n\nCoverage of pre-existing conditions was a big selling point of the law, but not everyone realizes that they can\u2019t just sign up the minute a condition is diagnosed. The regular dates and deadlines for enrolling still apply, no matter when you get appendicitis.\n\nYet 6 in 10 uninsured Americans didn\u2019t know March 31 was the cutoff for getting 2014 coverage, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation poll last month. They didn\u2019t know that missing the deadline meant they\u2019d be locked out until November (unless they\u2019re eligible for Medicaid, which has no such restriction.)\n\n\u201cSince they don\u2019t even know that there\u2019s a deadline, I don\u2019t think that they could know the next step, which is that they can\u2019t enroll for the rest of the year,\u201d said Mollyann Brodie, executive director of public opinion and survey research at Kaiser.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a shock, and we are going to be fielding a lot of calls,\u201d said Michael Mahoney, a senior vice president with the online insurance broker GoHealth. \u201cBut there\u2019s not much you can do to help.\u201d\n\n( PHOTOS: 20 quotes: More Obamacare, less work)\n\nOne reason for the confusion might have been all those delays and extensions. Just before March 31, the administration granted people with special circumstances or sign-up difficulties a bit more time.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s almost an assumption that there\u2019s never a real deadline on anything,\u201d said Tom Miller, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and a critic of the law.\n\nThe risk: Anyone who gets sick and thinks they can just waltz in and get insurance is in for a shock. They just might blame it on Obamacare \u2014 or President Barack Obama. And then when they get hit with a penalty for not having insurance, they\u2019ll be even angrier.\n\n2. The $95 mandate myth\n\nMost people know there\u2019s a penalty for being uncovered. But they are wrong about the amount.\n\n\u201cYou have to pause and say, \u2018It\u2019s not one Ben Franklin, it\u2019s probably closer to three,\u2019\u201d said Brian Haile, senior vice president for health policy at Jackson Hewitt Tax Service Inc. Customers constantly walked in and declared that they were going to forgo coverage and cough up the $95 penalty, he said. Then they\u2019d learn that it was actually $95 or 1 percent of income, whichever is greater. In 2016, the amount increases to $695 or 2.5 percent of income.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Obama's challenge: Don't blow it)\n\n\u201cThey say, \u2018Well, that\u2019s a lot more than what my congressman told me, or what I read in the newspaper or heard on television,\u2019\u201d Haile said. \u201cThey\u2019re sort of flummoxed.\u201d\n\nThe government didn\u2019t stress the penalty during much of the outreach. \u201cI have a strong feeling that the kind of vagueness about the mandate and penalty was deliberate,\u201d said Jacobs, the political scientist. \u201cIt\u2019s better to attract people with the benefit than threaten them the IRS is going after them.\u201d\n\nCeci Connolly, managing director of the Health Research Institute at PricewaterhouseCoopers, said she\u2019s not sure that was a smart strategy. Her research found that Massachusetts\u2019s emphasis on a penalty when its own health reform law took effect motivated people to sign up.\n\nOf course, Obamacare won\u2019t hit anyone with a fine until Americans start to do their 2014 taxes next year. That means it comes due in 2015 \u2014 after the November midterms but in time for the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nThe risk: a delayed but nasty surprise at tax time.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Friess's Obamacare-Hitler parody)\n\n3. I can\u2019t afford Obamacare\n\nFour in 10 uninsured Americans still don\u2019t know that the Affordable Care Act offers financial assistance to low- and moderate-income individuals, according to that Kaiser poll. Plus, many of the GOP attacks on the law that people hear are about its cost.\n\nEnroll America found that perception of high costs was the single biggest barrier to enrollment in this first season. Over the course of the enrollment period, the group fine-tuned its messaging to stress the availability of financial help and interest soared. \u201cOnce the connection is made, the likelihood of those people enrolling goes through the roof,\u201d Enroll\u2019s field director John Gilbert said.\n\nBut sometimes people who knew generally about the assistance didn\u2019t realize that they themselves might qualify, said Christine Barber, a senior policy analyst at Community Catalyst. \u201cPeople are really surprised that they can get financial help and that the law can benefit them,\u201d she said.\n\nAnd subsidies don\u2019t prevent sticker shock for everyone; the aid gets \u201cthinner\u201d as people move up the sliding income scale. \u201cThat will be off-putting for some,\u201d said Karen Pollitz, a senior fellow at Kaiser.\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to know how many people never applied for coverage \u2014 or sidestepped an exchange and bought a policy elsewhere at full cost \u2014 because they didn\u2019t understand how much help was available.\n\nThe risk: People who learn that they missed out on a good (or a better) deal will want to blame someone \u2014 and it probably won\u2019t be themselves.\n\nAuthors:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "As the process enters the next stage, inevitably there will be some confusion.", "title": "ACA's next obstacle: Confused users", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/04/obamacare-next-obstacle-105456.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/01/02/140102_obamacare_ap_605.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Obamacare,Health Care,HealthCare.Gov", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "As the process enters the next stage, inevitably there will be some confusion.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "ACA's next obstacle: Confused usersObama administration officials hoping to exhale after the big finish to Obamacare\u2019s first enrollment season may need to hold their breath a while longer.\nThey didn\u2019t know that missing the deadline meant they\u2019d be locked out until November (unless they\u2019re eligible for Medicaid, which has no such restriction.)\nYet 6 in 10 uninsured Americans didn\u2019t know March 31 was the cutoff for getting 2014 coverage, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation poll last month.\nThe $95 mandate mythMost people know there\u2019s a penalty for being uncovered.\nI can\u2019t afford ObamacareFour in 10 uninsured Americans still don\u2019t know that the Affordable Care Act offers financial assistance to low- and moderate-income individuals, according to that Kaiser poll."}
