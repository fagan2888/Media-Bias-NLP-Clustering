This is in large part because of the \u201cwhistleblower bounty\u201d provision of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, which allows for monetary awards for those who provide original, useful information about a securities fraud that results in a successful Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) enforcement action with at least $1 million in sanctions.\n\nHowever, the current protective atmosphere enjoyed by whistleblowers is actually a more recent phenomenon. The modern era of whistleblower defense began with the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA), which included provisions to protect federal employees who disclose information which the employees reasonably believe evidences \u201ca violation of law, rule, or regulation, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority or a specific and substantial danger to public health or safety.\u201d\n\nThe CSRA was largely regarded as being ineffective at protecting federal whistleblowers, with Congress finding that the CSRA-created Office of the Special Counsel (OSC) \u201chad not brought a single corrective action case since 1979\u2026on behalf of a whistleblower,\u201d which is what the OSC was created in part to do.\n\nThus, Congress passed the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989 (WPA) on March 21, 1989, and it was signed into law by President George H.W. Bush on April 10, 1989, 26 years ago today.\n\nThe primary federal statute behind whistleblower protections today, the WPA gave federal whistleblowers the right to pursue their own cases before the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), which was originally created by the CSRA to review claims of misconduct brought forth by whistleblowers.\n\nUnfortunately, the WPA was only marginally more effective at shielding federal whistleblowers from retaliation, with the MSPB denying 98% of whistleblower appeals coming before it.\n\nNevertheless, the WPA is an important milestone in whistleblower legal history. First, it was the first federal law for which its sole purpose \u2013 as could be gleaned from its name \u2013 was to protect whistleblowers. By contrast, the CSRA had another goal often at odds with its whistleblower protections: increasing the power of management to deal with poor performance in federal employees.\n\nOn a larger scale, the WPA represents an attitude shift toward emphasizing the importance of defending whistleblowers against reprisal. Since its enactment 26 years ago, whistleblower protections have become common in a number of laws, such as 2002\u2019s Sarbanes-Oxley Act and 2010\u2019s Affordable Care Act. And of course, the WPA paved the way not only for future protections for those reporting organizational misconduct, but also for actual rewards for those individuals providing such information, as found in the Dodd-Frank whistleblower bounty provision.\n\nFurthermore, the WPA itself was significantly strengthened by 2012\u2019s Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act, reflecting this growing position on the importance of safeguarding whistleblowers.\n\nThus, the original WPA was, in many ways, marked the turning of the tide toward this attitude shift \u2013 a shift that seems to continue turning in favor of whistleblowers even today.", "article_metadata": {"description": "On April 10, 1989, the Whistleblower Protection Act was signed into law, marking the beginning of the modern era of whistleblower defense laws.", "generator": "WordPress 4.1.11", "og": {"site_name": "Legal Solutions Blog", "description": "On April 10, 1989, the Whistleblower Protection Act was signed into law, marking the beginning of the modern era of whistleblower defense laws.", "title": "Today in 1989: The Whistleblower Protection Act is signed into law", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://blog.legalsolutions.thomsonreuters.com/wp-content/uploads//2010/07/today-in-legal-history.jpg", "url": "http://blog.legalsolutions.thomsonreuters.com/legal-research/today-in-1989-the-whistleblower-protection-act-is-signed-into-law/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Legal Solutions Blog", "description": "On April 10, 1989, the Whistleblower Protection Act was signed into law, marking the beginning of the modern era of whistleblower defense laws.", "title": "Today in 1989: The Whistleblower Protection Act is signed into law", "image": {"src": "http://blog.legalsolutions.thomsonreuters.com/wp-content/uploads//2010/07/today-in-legal-history.jpg"}, "creator": "@westlaw", "site": "@westlaw", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Westlaw1", "section": "Legal Research", "tag": "1980s,Today in Legal History,whistleblower", "published_time": "2015-04-10T12:11:16+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=1020"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe11c8\"", "article_summary": "Thus, Congress passed the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989 (WPA) on March 21, 1989, and it was signed into law by President George H.W.\nFurthermore, the WPA itself was significantly strengthened by 2012\u2019s Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act, reflecting this growing position on the importance of safeguarding whistleblowers.\nSince its enactment 26 years ago, whistleblower protections have become common in a number of laws, such as 2002\u2019s Sarbanes-Oxley Act and 2010\u2019s Affordable Care Act.\nUnfortunately, the WPA was only marginally more effective at shielding federal whistleblowers from retaliation, with the MSPB denying 98% of whistleblower appeals coming before it.\nBy contrast, the CSRA had another goal often at odds with its whistleblower protections: increasing the power of management to deal with poor performance in federal employees."}
