Robert Presutti, school president.\n\nWhile the school doesn\u2019t set out to win awards, Presutti said that it was a nice way to recognize the efforts of faculty and staff.\n\n\u201cI know no one here tries to work for awards, but it\u2019s a great one,\u201d he said. \u201cThe hard work and sacrifices are recognized in this way, and \u2026 hats off to our high school administration and our high school teachers, who just do an excellent job.\u201d\n\nPresutti added that Pinecrest\u2019s teachers and administrators were not only interested in teaching knowledge and skills, but also wanted students to reach their calling in life.\n\n\u201cWe take our Catholic identity very seriously, the whole history of Catholic education, Catholic intellectual tradition of trying to bring out academic excellence, not simply from a career advancement point of view, but from a human vocation point of view,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s education for life, but its education to fulfill our goal and our mission in life. Our teachers see their work as a vocation. We see our being here as much more than giving an education \u2026 it\u2019s really transforming the individual to become \u2026 Christian leaders for society.\u201d\n\nPinecrest has won the award, previously known as the Top 50 Catholic High Schools, every year since 2007. That year was also the school\u2019s first graduating class.\n\nThe award is given by The Cardinal Newman Society, an organization of Catholic college alumni that promote Catholic education. The society was founded in 1993.\n\n\u201cSchools receiving the School of Excellence honor are marked by the integration of Catholic identity throughout all aspects of their programs and excellence in academics,\u201d said Vivian Heard, communications coordinator for the school.\n\n\u201cThis year, 71 schools across the country \u2026 received the honor of being named as a School of Excellence, and an additional nine received the distinction of Honorable Mention. This is less than 5 percent of all Catholic high schools in the United States.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.forsythnews.com/archives/25691/", "image": "http://media.morristechnology.com/webmedia/upload/forsythnews/article/2014/09/19/Pinecrest.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "SOUTH FORSYTH \u2014 For the eighth straight year, Pinecrest Academy in south Forsyth has been ranked as one of the top Catholic High Schools in the country.", "title": "Pinecrest ranks among top Catholic high schools"}, "robots": "noarchive", "title": "Pinecrest ranks among top Catholic high schools"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWhat it seeks to do is recognize Catholic high schools around the country that are excellent in their Catholic identity, which also involves high academic standards,\u201d said the Rev.\nSOUTH FORSYTH \u2014 For the eighth straight year, Pinecrest Academy in south Forsyth has been ranked as one of the top Catholic High Schools in the country.\nThis is less than 5 percent of all Catholic high schools in the United States.\u201d\nThe award is given by The Cardinal Newman Society, an organization of Catholic college alumni that promote Catholic education.\nThe private school on Peachtree Parkway was one of just two in Georgia named a 2014 School of Excellence by the Catholic Education Honor Roll."}
