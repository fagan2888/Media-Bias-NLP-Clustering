He\u2019s grateful for a new trend in health care: clinics located inside pharmacies staffed with nurse practitioners who can treat non-serious injuries and provide check-ups.\n\n\u201cMy schedule\u2019s pretty hectic,\u201d Vaccaro said recently while visiting a Minute Clinic inside a CVS drug store. \u201cBeing able to come over here and go back to work is nice. I work about 70 hours a week, and I\u2019m about to go back to work,\u201d he said following an examination for an ear infection.\n\nGov. Jerry Brown signed AB493 on Oct. 1, allowing pharmacies to provide expanded patient care services in the form of so-called \u201cretail health clinics.\u201d\n\nSenator Dr. Ed Hernandez authored the bill as a way to provide more patient access to health care.\n\nA report by the consulting group Accenture said the number of retail health clinics is expected to increase 20-25 percent per year between now and 2015.\n\n\u201cThe theory and reason why the services are expanding is because they can be offered at a lower price,\u201d said Jenn Francis, spokeswoman for Accenture. \u201cRetailers offer a location as a convenience, so it\u2019s another distribution factor.\u201d\n\nCVS, which already had retail health clinics in other states, immediately responded to the California retail health clinic legislation, opening 14 Minute Clinics in the Los Angeles area as well as others in Orange County and San Diego. Brent Burkhart, a spokesman from Minute Clinic, said the company plans to open clinics in San Jose as well.\n\nSome 750 Minute Clinics are now in 27 states, and by 2017, the company projects to have 1,500 clinics, Burkhart said.\n\nA variety of factors drive the growth, in particular the Affordable Care Act, which is expected to cause a shortage of primary care physicians to the tune of about 50,000 by 2025.\n\nPrimary care physicians like retail health clinics because of the scope of services they offer, Francis said.\n\n\u201cIt frees up capacity so they can serve other patients who have more critical needs,\u201d she said.\n\nThe clinics treat all of the common illnesses: sore throats, ear infections, bronchial infections, different upper respiratory illnesses and flu. The clinics also provide common vaccines and flu shots and screenings for cholesterol.\n\nByron Antillon brought his daughter Isabel for a throat checkup at the CVS Minute Clinic at Granary Square.\n\n\u201cFor more serious things, of course, we\u2019ll go see the physician, but having kids, you\u2019re either going to be here for injuries, sore throats, infections, and that kind of stuff,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just in and out here. It\u2019s really quick,\u201d Antillon said. \u201cFor us, we\u2019ve got three kids and we\u2019re busy all the time, so this is a godsend for us.\u201d\n\n\u201cOver 50 percent of our visits at most of our clinics are evenings and weekends when most primary care offices are closed,\u201d said Janette Sorkin, a nurse practitioner with CVS. \u201cIt\u2019s truly not in place of (traditional health care); it\u2019s really an adjunct,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cEither they can\u2019t get in or patients will say, \u2018I just need a tetanus shot, and they didn\u2019t have an opening for two weeks,\u2019 or \u2018I need a TB test, but they won\u2019t have an opening for another week or two, and I need it by Monday, and it\u2019s a Friday.\u2019\u201d\n\nTwo other large retail chains, Walgreens and RiteAid, are eyeing retail health clinics. Walgreens has 400 locations but none in California. Spokesman Phil Caruso said the company has no current plans to expand into California but did not say why.\n\nAt least one locally owned drug store has also considered the option.\n\nJim Berkebile, general manager from Saugus Drugs, said the owner considered opening a retail health clinic in a back room but, due to a subletting issue, could not take on the project.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.signalscv.com/archives/110386/", "image": "http://media.morristechnology.com/webmedia/upload/santa_clarita/article/2013/12/10/1210_news_minute_clinic_CK_01_online.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Santa Clarita - Michael Vaccaro commutes every day from North Hollywood to the Santa Clarita Valley and he puts in long hours once he gets here working as district sales manager for a department store.", "title": "Health care on the go"}, "robots": "noarchive", "title": "Health care on the go"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcda53\"", "article_summary": "Jerry Brown signed AB493 on Oct. 1, allowing pharmacies to provide expanded patient care services in the form of so-called \u201cretail health clinics.\u201dSenator Dr. Ed Hernandez authored the bill as a way to provide more patient access to health care.\nHe\u2019s grateful for a new trend in health care: clinics located inside pharmacies staffed with nurse practitioners who can treat non-serious injuries and provide check-ups.\n\u201cIt\u2019s truly not in place of (traditional health care); it\u2019s really an adjunct,\u201d she said.\nPrimary care physicians like retail health clinics because of the scope of services they offer, Francis said.\nA report by the consulting group Accenture said the number of retail health clinics is expected to increase 20-25 percent per year between now and 2015."}
