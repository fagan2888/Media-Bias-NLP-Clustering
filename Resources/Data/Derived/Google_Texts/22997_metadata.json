And Barack Obama won that 60-30 \u2026 (Republicans) have to be the solutions party. And right now, they\u2019re not the solutions party. They\u2019re just kind of against what Obama is for \u2026 Republicans need to make this point that they can help the middle class, that they\u2019re not just for the rich and that they care about working people, and so far they just haven\u2019t done a very good job of that.\u201d\n\nA number of conservatives have worried the country has changed, that too many people are becoming too reliant on government spending and an entitlements. But Moore says he retains his optimism.\n\n\u201cI believe what Reagan said, that it\u2019s divine inspiration that put America here, as a beacon of freedom, and it\u2019s almost in our DNA as Americans that we won\u2019t move down the failed path of socialism,\u201d Moore said. \u201cThat\u2019s almost a religious faith to me.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s New Mexico Watchdog video of Moore talking about a host of economic issues:\n\nContact Rob Nikolewski at rnikolewski@watchdog.org and follow him on Twitter @robnikolewski", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Conservative economist Stephen Moore says Washington treats businesses as if they are ATM machines, making businesses reluctant to invest.", "title": "Stephen Moore: Washington treats businesses like they're ATMs - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/03/stephen-moore.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-12-19T11:36:04+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/132814/stephen-moore-economy/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Economy", "tag": "Affordable Care Act,Business,Heritage Foundation,ObamaCare,Politics,Politics & Elections 1,right to work,Stephen Moore,Tax Policy,Tax Reform", "published_time": "2014-03-17T04:00:14+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-19T11:36:04+00:00"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Conservative economist Stephen Moore says Washington treats businesses as if they are ATM machines, making businesses reluctant to invest.", "title": "Stephen Moore: Washington treats businesses like they're ATMs - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/03/stephen-moore.jpg"}, "creator": "@watchdogorg", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "description": "Conservative economist Stephen Moore says Washington treats businesses as if they are ATM machines, making businesses reluctant to invest."}, "article_summary": "\u201cWe should be among the lowest income tax countries, not the highest.\u201dMoore agrees that the middle class is getting squeezed.\n\u201cIf you look at businesses today, they\u2019re sitting on one to two trillion dollars in capital,\u201d Moore said.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s almost a psychological-cultural thing in Washington that we\u2019ve treated businesses like they\u2019re ATM machines, that the purpose of businesses is to pay more taxes and pay for more government services,\u201d Stephen Moore said after he gave a one-hour speech in Albuquerque on Friday.\n\u201cIf you look at the (2012) election, it\u2019s not really hard to understand why he won,\u201d Moore said.\n\u201cThe average middle class family has lost $2,000 in income in real purchasing power since the recovery began,\u201d he said."}
