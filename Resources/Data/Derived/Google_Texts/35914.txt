A budget deficit is all but certain to emerge in Kansas with new, more pessimistic revenue projections expected in the coming week.

Republican Gov. Sam Brownback already has ruled out further tax increases after sales and cigarette taxes went up in July. And legislators aren't much interested anyway after the bitter, record-long annual session.

State officials learn Monday whether tax collections in October met expectations after falling short in recent months.

Then, economists, legislative researchers and state officials are scheduled Friday to issue new revenue projections to guide budget decisions.

Brownback budget director Shawn Sullivan said the governor and his aides are likely to consider targeted spending cuts and other budget adjustments, such as shuffling money among various government accounts.
