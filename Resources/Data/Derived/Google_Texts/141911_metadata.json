We know our current president is one -- you know he\u2019s not even an American. But anyway, we have training camps growing where they want to kill us. That\u2019s my question, when can we get rid of them?\u201d one man asked during a Trump campaign rally in New Hampshire.\n\nHe was followed by another man who made the same claim.\n\n\u201cI applaud the gentleman who stood and said Obama is a Muslim born abroad and about the military camps, everyone knows that,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d Trump replied before moving on.\n\nThe billionaire\u2019s campaign has since said Trump didn\u2019t hear the question and that\u2019s why he didn\u2019t refute it at the time.\n\nWhile Obama is a Christian who was born in Hawaii, the episode evoked memories of when Trump questioned the president\u2019s citizenship, and his quest to get the president to release his college transcripts and passport history \u2013 at one point offering to donate $5 million to charity if the commander-in-chief did so.\n\nRelated: The Best Quotes and Zingers from the CNN Republican Debate\n\nOther 2016 contenders, like New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), have already condemned Trump for not immediately rejecting the remarks.\n\nThe rally capped what has been a rough week for Trump.\n\nWhile he was front and center at this week\u2019s GOP presidential debate, he didn\u2019t loom over the event as his did during the first one in Cleveland last month. Trump largely disappeared in the last hour of the debate, possibly owing to the over three-hour format.\n\nMedia coverage after the event has mostly focused on former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina, whose dominant performance is likely to catapult her to the upper echelon of the GOP field.\n\nMeanwhile, a key conservative group this week signaled it\u2019s had enough of Trump\u2019s candidacy.\n\nOn Tuesday, the influential Club for Growth announced its political arm would launch a $1 million advertising campaign in the crucial state of Iowa. The two television ads seek to paint Trump as \u201cthe worst kind of politician\u201d and play up his past claims, like that he identifies as a Democrat.\n\nTrump is \u201cplaying us for chumps,\u201d one spot says.\n\nRelated: With His Back to the Wall, Graham a Standout in the \u2018Undercard\u2019 GOP Debate\n\nThus far, Trump has shown a Teflon-like ability to shrug off criticism from his fellow candidates, Democrats and the media. However, this week shows his time atop the polls is beginning to have an accumulative effect, with several possible battlefronts opening up before him.\n\nThe trend is likely to continue after Wednesday night\u2019s debate, where Trump mixed it up with several other contenders. The often heated exchanges could spark more oppositions ads, more critiques in the days ahead.\n\nPlus, Trump\u2019s seemingly endless capacity to make questionable, off-the-cuff remarks about his rivals could also prompt more scrutiny ahead of next month\u2019s debate in Colorado and lead to more embarrassing exchanges, similar to the one he had Wednesday with Fiorina.\n\nShe asked to respond to a critique Trump made about her looks during an interview with Rolling Stone magazine.\n\n\"I think women all over this country heard very clearly what Mr. Trump said,\" the 2016 hopeful said to sustained cheers and wild applause.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "It may seem to believe, given his meteoric rise to the top of the polls and his abilit", "title": "Controversial Rally Continues Bad Week for Trump", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/09/18/Controversial-Rally-Continues-Bad-Week-Trump", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-election-trump_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/09/18/Controversial-Rally-Continues-Bad-Week-Trump", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-election-trump_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "It may seem to believe, given his meteoric rise to the top of the polls and his abilit", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "That\u2019s my question, when can we get rid of them?\u201d one man asked during a Trump campaign rally in New Hampshire.\nThe billionaire\u2019s campaign has since said Trump didn\u2019t hear the question and that\u2019s why he didn\u2019t refute it at the time.\nThe rally capped what has been a rough week for Trump.\nRelated: Trump Walks Into an Ambush in Second GOP Presidential Debate\u201cWe have a problem in this country, it\u2019s called Muslims.\nThe trend is likely to continue after Wednesday night\u2019s debate, where Trump mixed it up with several other contenders."}
