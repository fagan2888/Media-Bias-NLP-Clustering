KETV NewsWatch 7 and the Kountze Memorial Lutheran Church have been neighbors for 50 years. The station's move to the Burlington Station will allow the church to continue to grown and impact the community.

The church has provided a place of worship for 150 years.

"We don't want to be a congregation that forgets those who need a lift, who need some assistance from time to time," Rev. Jeffery Alvestad said.

The church serves 500 people every week out of its food pantry, which has since outgrown its space.

"The numbers are just constantly going up and up and up," church member and volunteer Robert Woodworth said.

Woodworth has been volunteering at the church for years, seeing firsthand the impact it makes.

"When you take for yourself, it doesn't mean much," Woodworth said. "When you give back, it's good."

The church recently purchased the KETV NewsWatch 7 property, so it could expand its services.

"Not only would we like to be able to provide food for people, but we'd like to provide winter clothing, other necessary items," Alvestad said.

The church also hopes to grow its medical clinic, which helps around 50 people each week.





"We've seen some plans already, they're pretty exciting, lot of green spaces too with new buildings," Woodworth said.

Plans will officially be revealed to church members next week.
