After gathering signatures (in truth, 60,000 more than necessary), Initiative 20, dubbed the \u201cState Health Care System,\u201d will be presented to Coloradans in a year\u2019s time. If approved, the measure would form ColoradoCare, a state-run single-payer health care program that would, instead of private insurers, pay Colorado residents\u2019 medical costs.\n\nNaturally, residents will have the ability to choose their providers on their own \u2014 ColoradoCare will be accepted universally in-state. According to one of the people behind this push, Ivan Miller, the new program would cover anyone making an income and residing in the state. This is part of what would set ColoradoCare apart from the so-called Obamacare Medicaid expansions.\n\nHow will all of this be paid for? Initiative 20 will levy new payroll taxes: For employers, 6.67 percent will be withheld and their employers will add another 3.33 percent from their own payrolls for a total of 10 percent. Those Coloradans who are self-employed will be contributing 10 percent of their net income. Together, it would raise an additional $25 billion annually for the new program.\n\nDetractors of ColoradoCare worry about heading into what they say is potentially risky, unknown territory. Board President of the Colorado State Association of Health Underwriters Byron McCurdy told the Denver Post that he was convinced a single-payer health care system \u201cwould destroy our industry.\u201d McCurdy says Colorado hospitals and clinics would \u201chave trouble recruiting physicians.\u201d He argues that the budget figures don\u2019t add up and couldn\u2019t possibly lead to anything better than what Colorado already has under its current expanded Medicaid system.\n\nHowever, state-run single-payer advocate Ivan Miller says Colorado taxpayers would actually be saving money under ColoradoCare. Even with a 10 percent increase on payroll taxes, Coloradans would actually save a combined $5 billion annually. How? By side-stepping the costly administrative costs that come with having a variety of independent systems (as it presently is with private insurers). The state will also save residents\u2019 tax dollars by working out bulk discount deals for pharmaceuticals.\n\nIf Colorado voters approve a state-run single-payer health program, it could do what the final version of the Affordable Care Act has failed to do (and could never succeed in, by its very nature) \u2014 insure low-income workers. As CNBC has found, a number of business owners have been stunned by the extremely low number of workers buying into ACA-mandated employer-offered insurance options. But it\u2019s not that these employees don\u2019t want health care coverage \u2014 rather, it\u2019s that they simply cannot afford the insurance.\n\nEven though the ACA requires the employer-offered options be 9.5 percent of workers\u2019 take home, to make it supposedly accessible, that can still be out of range for many. And even if it weren\u2019t, the sticking point is often the coverage\u2019s high deductible; in one example, a $140 per month plan comes with a $2,500 deductible, a figure that is financially unfeasible for low-income workers who are often already stretched to afford housing and food.\n\nWorse, most of these workers, despite being low-income, typically still earn too much to qualify for ACA-expanded Medicaid coverage. Because of the way the ACA is structured, gainfully employed workers on the lower end of the payroll spectrum often find themselves in the nether region between Medicaid-qualifying income brackets and being able to financially afford work-provided insurance. And, as such, they remain uninsured.\n\nThat\u2019s where Colorado\u2019s proposed state-run single-payer program comes in. As ColoradoCare\u2019s wide tent will cover even these individuals, the Affordable Care Act\u2019s progress will quickly seem disappointing by comparison. Coloradans would see their money going toward a public service rather than being forced by an ACA mandate to patronize a profit-driven industry that has little interest in whether low-income individuals are able to access the health care they need.\n\nPhoto Credit: psphotograph / Thinkstock", "article_metadata": {"description": "Colorado may get a state-run single-payer health care system -- a program that would close major gaps in the ACA Medicaid expansions.", "og": {"image": "http://dingo.care2.com/pictures/causes/3159/3158278.large.jpg"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "34d24671362965e0c3942e7b3b484ea7"}, "fb": {"app_id": 83187307959}, "keywords": "health care,health,colorado,single-payer,affordable care act,obamacare,health insurance,medicine,state-run health care", "viewport": "width=device-width,user-scalable=no,initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "If approved, the measure would form ColoradoCare, a state-run single-payer health care program that would, instead of private insurers, pay Colorado residents\u2019 medical costs.\nIn what could be yet another first for the state of Colorado, the possibility of a state-run single-payer health care program will be on the state\u2019s ballot in 2016.\nAfter gathering signatures (in truth, 60,000 more than necessary), Initiative 20, dubbed the \u201cState Health Care System,\u201d will be presented to Coloradans in a year\u2019s time.\nBut it\u2019s not that these employees don\u2019t want health care coverage \u2014 rather, it\u2019s that they simply cannot afford the insurance.\nThat\u2019s where Colorado\u2019s proposed state-run single-payer program comes in."}
