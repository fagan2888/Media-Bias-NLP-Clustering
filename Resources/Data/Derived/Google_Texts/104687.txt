Riverside Adds Training Factor to Grace Hill

The deal follows the PE firm's addition of LeaseHawk's education program to the real estate training company

Private equity firm the Riverside Co. has made another add-on acquisition to real estate education group Grace Hill.

Riverside picked up the Training Factor, a Kennesaw, Georgia-based real estate education company that provides a "mystery shopping" component to its system that allows customers to see if their leasing agents are complying with training programs. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.

Grace Hill has more than 460,000 members who have taken more than 1.1 million courses digitally. The company provides regulatory, OSHA and sexual harassment training for real estate professionals.

This is not Riverside's first add-on to Grace Hill, which the firm picked up in August. In November, the group added LeaseHawk's education division.

Cleveland and New York-based Riverside also announced on Dec. 2 that it sold Precision Wire Components to Creganna-Tactx Medical. Both the Precision Wire and Training Factor deals come one day after the PE firm announced the sale of Baby Jogger to Newell Rubbermaid (NYSE: NWL).
