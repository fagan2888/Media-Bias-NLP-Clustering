The GOP establishment hates Senator Cruz because of his arrogance and for his role in the government shutdown in a fight over the Affordable Care Act.\n\nBoth Mr. Trump and Senator Cruz share common views when it comes to women, gays and transgender individuals. Both men are opposed to Planned Parenthood, gay marriage and transgender rights. Nevertheless, the GOP establishment views Mr. Trump as not being sufficiently conservative and Senator Cruz as being too conservative.\n\nThe GOP establishment has been slow to criticize Mr. Trump for his racist and misogynistic rhetoric. On the other hand, Senator Cruz has often been criticized by his colleagues in the Senate for his grandstanding tactics and has been called the most hated man in the Senate.\n\nThe campaigns of both men have been guilty of a childish battle of tweets regarding the candidates' wives. Both candidates have accused each other of lying. Neither campaign has presented rational suggestions for the economy, immigration reform, foreign policy or climate-related issues.\n\nAfter seven years of railing against the Obama administration, the Republican Party has failed to bring forth a presidential candidate with the character and temperament needed to lead the nation.\n\nDon Steiner\n\nSchenectady", "article_metadata": {"SKYPE_TOOLBAR": "SKYPE_TOOLBAR_PARSER_COMPATIBLE", "description": "Anyone who doubts that the Republican Party has lost its way need only consider the controversies surrounding the two leading candidates for the GOP presidential nomination, Donald Trump and Ted Cruz.
