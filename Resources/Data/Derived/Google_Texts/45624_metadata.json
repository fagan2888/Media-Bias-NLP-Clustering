To give them the food, to see their smiling faces, the little kids running to the door, it's just an amazing gift to be able to give back,\" Younts said.\n\nShe has been to the event several times but not always to lend a helping hand. Younts said when she was a child, her family was in need and came to the dinner as a guest.\n\n\"We enjoyed all of the food, all of the festivities, the music, all of that. I have so many memories of just listening to the music and smiling faces. So it was just a big part of growing up,\" she said.\n\nYounts said it's the spirit of giving that makes the event so special.\n\nPatiricia Jimenez, the daughter of the dinner's namesake, Raul Jimenez, said that's exactly what has kept the event going for over three decades.\n\n\"That's how we've been able to exist for 36 years is that everyone is touched by the event in some shape or form, and everybody wants to continue the traditions. So I think it really is important that we have all these volunteers help us,\" Patiricia Jimenez said.\n\n\"All of these people coming together for a truly selfless act, on Thanksgiving or before Thanksgiving, it's always inspired me, and always created such a humble feeling to be able to give back and spend time with these people,\" Younts said.\n\nThe doors at the Henry B. Gonzalez Center will open at 9 a.m. Thursday with meals set to be served at 10:30 a.m. A worship service will be held at 10 a.m.\n\nIf you can\u2019t leave your home but would still like a meal, call 211. United Way volunteers will make a Thanksgiving Day delivery to your home.\n\nCopyright 2015 by KSAT - All rights reserved.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://media.ksat.com/photo/2015/11/26/Vanessa-Younts_1448542143451_650959_ver1.0_160_90.JPG", "sailthru.author": "Isis Romero", "description": "News", "author": "Isis Romero", "og": {"site_name": "KSAT", "description": "News", "title": "Woman returns to Raul Jimenez Thanksgiving Dinner as volunteer", "url": "http://www.ksat.com/news/woman-returns-to-raul-jimenez-thanksgiving-dinner-as-volunteer", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://media.ksat.com/photo/2015/11/26/Vanessa-Younts_1448542143451_650959_ver1.0_1280_720.JPG", "height": 720}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "News", "title": "Woman returns to Raul Jimenez Thanksgiving Dinner as volunteer", "url": "http://www.ksat.com/news/woman-returns-to-raul-jimenez-thanksgiving-dinner-as-volunteer", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://media.ksat.com/photo/2015/11/26/Vanessa-Younts_1448542143451_650959_ver1.0_1280_720.JPG", "height": 720}, "site": "@ksatnews", "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-11-26T13:09:44+0000", "sailthru.title": "Woman returns to Raul Jimenez Thanksgiving Dinner as volunteer", "sailthru.tags": "News,Local,Thanksgiving,Top Stories", "fb": {"app_id": 362904920453016}, "google-site-verification": "saKN_Rxj3pYzy5TY3_Llko_4hA3OUGCoya0vO4STuSc", "keywords": "News,Local,Thanksgiving,Top Stories", "article": {"section": "News", "published_time": "2015-11-26T13:09:44+0000", "modified_time": "2015-11-26T13:09:44+0000", "author": "http://www.ksat.com/author/iromero"}, "news_keywords": "News", "content_id": 139223880, "sailthru.description": "News", "sailthru.image.full": "http://media.ksat.com/photo/2015/11/26/Vanessa-Younts_1448542143451_650959_ver1.0_1280_720.JPG", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page-type": "article"}, "article_summary": "SAN ANTONIO - The annual Raul Jimenez Thanksgiving Dinner is made possible by the hard work of about 4,000 volunteers, like Vanessa Younts.\nPatiricia Jimenez, the daughter of the dinner's namesake, Raul Jimenez, said that's exactly what has kept the event going for over three decades.\nYounts said when she was a child, her family was in need and came to the dinner as a guest.\nSo I think it really is important that we have all these volunteers help us,\" Patiricia Jimenez said.\nUnited Way volunteers will make a Thanksgiving Day delivery to your home."}
