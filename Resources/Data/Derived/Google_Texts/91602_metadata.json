But if you\u2019re in Wisconsin, and relying on food stamps, remember that Republicans don\u2019t want you to have ketchup on your hamburger. They\u2019d probably rather you didn\u2019t have a hamburger at all, but Wisconsin farmers and ranchers have clout, and so proposed cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program made room for Wisconsin products. But they still don\u2019t want you to have \u201ccrab, lobster, shrimp, or any other shellfish.\u201d Or ketchup. Or spaghetti sauce. Really.\n\nFor now, that\u2019s all grandstanding. SNAP is a federal program, and the Obama administration hasn\u2019t allowed states to restrict food purchases that way. But that hasn\u2019t stopped GOP legislators from trying. Maine and Missouri want to ban SNAP \u201cjunk food\u201d purchases. Wisconsin and 16 other states are also trying to drug test recipients.\n\nAnd Wisconsin has nothing on Brownbackistan, I mean Kansas. The state has already outlawed the use of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program debit cards at a range of businesses, including movie theaters, college sports games (?) and cruise ships. (There goes the welfare cruise ship business!) Kansas TANF recipients also are unable to withdraw more than $25 a day from their accounts. That means to withdraw $100, they\u2019ll pay five bank fees (since ATMs only dispense $20s). Banks win, the poor lose.\n\nAll this is happening against the backdrop of GOP policy failure. We\u2019ve had a 30-plus year experiment in Republican approaches to the problems of poverty and declining economic opportunity \u2013 and it\u2019s turned out abysmally. Ronald Reagan convinced a lot of people that \u201cwe fought a war on poverty, and poverty won,\u201d so Democrats came together with Republicans and slashed the largest welfare program for families with children, first in the states, then federally. Bill Clinton signed the federal bill into law, thinking he could get the issue of the lazy poor behind him, and then concentrate on the supports low-wage workers might need to climb.\n\nOf course, Clinton never completed that part of his agenda; he got distracted by the GOP witch hunt known as impeachment. Republicans still didn\u2019t want to make friends even after Clinton gave them punitive welfare reform; go figure.", "article_metadata": {"description": "As Republican anti-poverty policies fail to reduce poverty, states are doubling down on making the poor miserable", "title": "GOP\u2019s demonic new crusade: Right-wing zealots look for even crueler ways to treat the poor like garbage", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "As Republican anti-poverty policies fail to reduce poverty, states are doubling down on making the poor miserable", "title": "GOP\u2019s demonic new crusade: Right-wing zealots look for even crueler ways to treat the poor like garbage", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/25/gops_demonic_new_crusade_right_wing_zealots_look_for_even_crueler_ways_to_treat_the_poor_like_garbage/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/walker_brownback.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "As Republican anti-poverty policies fail to reduce poverty, states are doubling down on making the poor miserable", "title": "GOP\u2019s demonic new crusade: Right-wing zealots look for even crueler ways to treat the poor like garbage", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/walker_brownback.jpg", "creator": "@joanwalsh", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Joan Walsh", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 2016 Elections, Conservatives, Gov.
