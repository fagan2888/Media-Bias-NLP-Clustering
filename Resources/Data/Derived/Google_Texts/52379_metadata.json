Who could\u2019ve guessed a movie featuring a green warrior, a literal-minded musclehead, a trigger-happy raccoon and the musical stylings of the \u201970s would be such an enjoyable hit? It shows there\u2019s a lot more to Marvel \u2014 and comics in general \u2014 than superheroes. Comics love sci-fi, too.\n\nIn fact, superhero comics could easily be considered a subgenre of sci-fi, at least the kind of soft sci-fi that\u2019s more in the fantasy realm, like \u201cGuardians.\u201d Sure, some superhero explanations are kind of rooted in the real world. Since we pump our athletes full of steroids, human growth hormone and other performance-enhancing drugs, the super-soldier serum that created Captain America seems plausible. President Obama once joked: \u201cBasically I\u2019m here to announce that we\u2019re building Iron Man.\u201d The mutants of the Marvel Universe are a result of evolution, which I hear is a thing. Even ideas as out there as the \u201cmultiverse\u201d \u2014 which will be taken to new heights in Grant Morrison\u2019s forthcoming \u201cMultiversity\u201d \u2014 have some basis in real science, specifically superstring theory.\n\nBut more often, superhero science is as scientific as voodoo, and even more fun. Some explanations are dumb; many are bonkers. To celebrate the fanciful and insane science of comic books, here\u2019s a look at some of the biggest scientific stretches. Don\u2019t try these experiments at home.\n\nSolar battery alien cells\n\nSuperman was the first superhero, so it\u2019s worth noting that crazy science has been in the DNA of superheroes since day one. The source of Superman\u2019s many powers \u2014 the flying, the heat vision, the ice breath, the strength, etc. \u2014 is that he\u2019s from Krypton, which has a red sun that isn\u2019t particularly empowering. On Earth, the yellow sun makes Superman the greatest advertisement for solar energy in history. So, as long as you can believe in aliens, solar-powered organic cells, an orphan in a rocket finding the perfect planet, and a guy with Superman\u2019s powers not being a douchebag, the science of Superman makes perfect sense.\n\nAlternate universe brain download\n\nAngstrom Levy, a scientist in Robert Kirkman\u2019s \u201cInvincible\u201d universe, tried to \u2014 as a henchmen recalled to him for the benefit of readers \u2014 \u201cdownload the memories of thousands of your doppelgangers from other dimensions in order to give you the ability to shift from one dimension to the next with the full knowledge of where you\u2019re going.\u201d You\u2019re not going to believe this, but something went wrong. In the middle of this multiversal brain dump, teen hero Invincible got in a brawl with the henchgoons, damaging the equipment and causing an explosion. Levy emerged with the unfathomable brainpower and dimension-hopping skills he sought \u2014 plus a hideously deformed body. As expected, Levy swore vengeance on Invincible. This incident was the contemporary version of when Lex Luthor blamed Superboy for the loss of his hair. The science accident has long been one of comic books\u2019 most dependable sources of amazing superpowers and bogus science, from the Flash in 1940 to goofball brothers Quantum and Woody.\n\nAlien burgers\n\nThese days, many are worried about eating genetically modified food. Well, if you lived in the Marvel Universe, that would be the least of your worries. Stay with me on this one: It\u2019s a doozy. Early in the days of the Fantastic Four, they faced some Skrulls: green aliens who have the ability to shape-shift, taking on any form, including humans or anything else. Reed Richards \u2014 the stretchy Mr. Fantastic and scientist of the group \u2014 brainwashed the Skrulls into thinking they were just regular cows, rendering them about as dangerous as any other barnyard animals. Slick move, right? Well, it was until the cows were butchered and people ate the hamburgers, resulting in \u201cSkrullovoria Induced Skrullophobia,\u201d which is not covered by Obamacare. Sufferers gained the shape-shifting powers of the Skrulls, along with an intense fear of the aliens; some formed the \u201cSkrull Kill Krew.\u201d Mad alien cow disease isn\u2019t the most plausible argument for vegetarianism, but it\u2019s an argument.", "article_metadata": {"description": "From brain-swapping to blood transfusions gone wrong, here are the most ridiculous superpower origin stories", "title": "The most absurd scientific explanations for comic book superpowers", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "From brain-swapping to blood transfusions gone wrong, here are the most ridiculous superpower origin stories", "title": "The most absurd scientific explanations for comic book superpowers", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/08/17/the_most_absurd_scientific_explanations_for_comic_book_superpowers/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/guardians_galaxy2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "From brain-swapping to blood transfusions gone wrong, here are the most ridiculous superpower origin stories", "title": "The most absurd scientific explanations for comic book superpowers", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/guardians_galaxy2.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Mark Peters", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Comic Books, Comics, guardians of the galaxy, superpowers", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe26d0\"", "article_summary": "But more often, superhero science is as scientific as voodoo, and even more fun.\nWell, if you lived in the Marvel Universe, that would be the least of your worries.\nTo celebrate the fanciful and insane science of comic books, here\u2019s a look at some of the biggest scientific stretches.\nPresident Obama once joked: \u201cBasically I\u2019m here to announce that we\u2019re building Iron Man.\u201d The mutants of the Marvel Universe are a result of evolution, which I hear is a thing.\nTopics: Comic Books, Comics, guardians of the galaxy, superpowers, Entertainment News\u201cGuardians of the Galaxy\u201d has been a huge financial and artistic hit for Marvel Studios."}
