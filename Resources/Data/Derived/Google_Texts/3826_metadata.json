It\u2019s up considerably from just a couple months ago.\n\nThe revised projection is for 60 gigawatts (GW) of coal generated electric capacity to be retired by 2020 instead of the previously predicted 43 GW. In 2012, coal supplied 309 GW of electricity generating capacity for the United States.\n\nThe EIA credits two things for the increase in coal retirements:\n\nMATS (Mercury & Air Toxics Standards) enforcement in 2016 Rise of cost competitive natural gas\n\nMATS is an Obama Administration EPA initiative that began in February, 2009. MATS has been designed, approved and goes into effect in April, 2015, with a built-in one year grace period. It applies to all new coal-fired power plants.\n\nIt requires plant operators to install expensive scrubbers to reduce toxic chemical pollution. Ninety percent of coal retirements before 2020 are expected to be done by 2016 because of MATS.\n\nMATS, though, only accelerates a private-sector, market driven conversion from coal-fired to natural gas-fired electric power plants made possible by the shale gas revolution. Eco-friendly natural gas doesn\u2019t have coal\u2019s toxic emissions. The exodus from coal began in 2007.\n\nIt is informative to compare scheduled electric plant retirements with planned new ones. Only one electricity source shows a decline \u2014 coal. It\u2019s a large decline, too.\n\nNatural gas will supply the bulk of new electric plant capacity coming online in the near term. Nuclear, wind and solar will also make contributions.\n\nEven in 2020, though, existing coal electric plants will still supply 32 percent of all U.S. electricity. Coal isn\u2019t going away anytime soon, but the writing is on the wall.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The EIA forecasts there will be 30 percent more coal-fired electric power plants retired by 2020 than forecast just two months ago", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "author": "Steve Davidson", "og": {"site_name": "Communities Digital News", "description": "The EIA forecasts there will be 30 percent more coal-fired electric power plants retired by 2020 that forecast just two months ago", "title": "U.S. coal-fired electric power dying faster than expected: New forecasts expected", "url": "http://www.commdiginews.com/health-science/u-s-coal-fired-electric-power-dying-faster-than-expected-new-forecasts-expected-8894/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://www.commdiginews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Big_Bend_Power_Station-640.jpg", "height": 427}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The EIA forecasts there will be 30 percent more coal-fired electric power plants retired by 2020 than forecast just two months ago", "title": "U.S. coal-fired electric power dying faster than expected: New forecasts expected", "image": "http://www.commdiginews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Big_Bend_Power_Station-640-435x375.jpg", "creator": "@commdiginews", "site": "@commdiginews", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "eia,energy information administration,electric power,coal,natural gas,nuclear power", "propeller": "a20eada6e38f74d5c5bf31354ee9760c", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-16T04:04:52+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-02-16T21:17:09+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "coal, EIA, electric power, Energy Information Administration, Natural Gas, Nuclear Power"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7ebf\"", "article_summary": "SALEM, Ore., February 15, 2014 \u2014 The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) released a revised forecast for coal-fired electric power plant retirements on Friday.\nIt is informative to compare scheduled electric plant retirements with planned new ones.\nNinety percent of coal retirements before 2020 are expected to be done by 2016 because of MATS.\nNatural gas will supply the bulk of new electric plant capacity coming online in the near term.\nMATS, though, only accelerates a private-sector, market driven conversion from coal-fired to natural gas-fired electric power plants made possible by the shale gas revolution."}
