Beginning Friday, 23 former RadioShack stores in Colorado become cobranded Sprint stores and will be happy to help you make that purchase. While the new signage may not begin immediately, there will be evidence that these stores are a bit different from regular Sprint outlets.\n\nOne third of the space will be dedicated to Sprint phones and products. The rest to electronics though actual inventory is unknown (radios anyone?).\n\n\u201cIt will take time for us to build out the store-within-a-store retail model and the stores are not physically co-branded yet (beyond perhaps a Sprint banner/signage on the front of an existing RadioShack store),\u201d said Dave Mellin, a Sprint regional spokesman. \u201c\u2026There will be other electronics items from RadioShack that will be available beyond the Sprint mobile devices.\u201d\n\nSprint picked up 1,435 new stores when RadioShack filed bankruptcy in February.\n\nWhile specifics about the look and inventory were not available Thursday, one thing is certain: the stores will only sell Sprint, Boost Mobile and Virgin Mobile products.\n\nSprint also needs 55 sales associates to work in those stores.
