MIDDLE TOWNSHIP â€” Prosecutors say a southern New Jersey mom was using a cellphone when her pickup truck crashed on a highway last year, killing her young daughter.

Cumberland County prosecutors have filed vehicular homicide charges against 40-year-old Kristen Williams, a Lower Township resident formerly known as Kristin Conner. She's also charged with child endangerment and causing death while violating safety laws.

The July 14 crash occurred in Cape May County, but is being handled in Cumberland County due to an undisclosed conflict in Cape May County.

Williams was driving northbound on Route 47 in Middle Township when her pickup truck hit a utility pole and a tree. Her 11-year-old daughter, Morgan Ferguson, was ejected during the crash and died a short time later.

No other vehicles were involved in the crash
