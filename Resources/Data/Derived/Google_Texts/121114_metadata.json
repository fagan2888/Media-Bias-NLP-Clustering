Eager to escape the tedium of riding indoors on a trainer and feel the wind in his face again, he was expecting good news.\n\nHe got his wish, but it came with a heartstopping blow. The doctor told him he could ride outside, but not for long, because there was a cyst growing deep within his brain that needed to be removed.\n\n\u201cI entered the appointment pretty excited and jovial,\u201d Crane recalled recently. \u201cHe was a little bit more stern.\u201d\n\nIt was a cruel setback for the Seattle-based Jamis-Hagens Berman rider who crashed chin-first through the rear window of a stopped team car while traveling an estimated 25 mph, about 8 miles south of Boulder on Colorado 93.\n\nA year later, on the eve of the fifth Pro Challenge, which starts Monday in Steamboat Springs, Crane is thankful he can still ride a bike, albeit not in competition.\n\nPHOTOS: USA Pro Challenge 2015 across Colorado\n\nCrane was airlifted to St. Anthony\u2019s Hospital, where it took an estimated 3,000 stitches to close the wounds in his mouth, plus another 50 stitches and staples in his face, neck and chest. He also suffered a broken shoulder blade, a broken bone in his skull and a deep brain injury. He spent 13 days there before being transferred to the University of Washington Rehab Center in Seattle. After eight days there, he began outpatient physical therapy in mid-September.\n\nHe wore a neck brace until Thanksgiving, and it took months to strengthen his atrophied neck muscles enough for him to ride outside. Then in February the doctor was telling him he would have to cut through those muscles to remove the cyst in his brain. Crane got to ride a few weeks before the surgery and participated in a team training camp.\n\n\u201cHe was struggling when all the other guys were going hard, but knowing everything he went through, it was very impressive to keep having a good attitude,\u201d said team director Seba Alexandre. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I would have that strength to do what he did \u2014 just wake up every day and try to train and get back on the bike.\u201d\n\nCrane savored those miles, knowing the \u201cterrifying\u201d brain surgery to come.\n\n\u201cI got to be reminded of just how great the bike is,\u201d Crane said. \u201cYou can learn this when something gets taken away from you, just how amazing it is.\u201d\n\nCrane came through the surgery and was able to get back on the bike by June, but it has meant riding in a lot of pain.\n\n\u201cRegardless of how fast I\u2019m going or where I\u2019m going, I just really love riding my bike,\u201d Crane said. \u201cI was having pretty debilitating neck-related cramps, starting about 15 minutes into riding. All muscular ability would shut off at about the hour point, and I just wouldn\u2019t be able to turn my head \u2014 wouldn\u2019t be able to move my neck at all \u2014 which is pretty terrifying when you\u2019re riding out on the road.\u201d\n\nHe can tolerate longer rides now, \u201cfor however long I want to deal with my neck hurting,\u201d but he doesn\u2019t know if he will ever be able to race again.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d love to be able to race at a high level and be competitive and be a professional still. (But) I\u2019m worried now about being able to physically live a long and happy life. I have a lot of residual issues from the crash and surgery that I\u2019m still working through. I feel pretty far away from my speedy past self. I am doing what I can to improve on those issues, but I still can\u2019t go on a bike ride without it being incredibly uncomfortable.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s still dealing with the effects of his traumatic brain injury. He underwent speech therapy. Driving in traffic makes him anxious.\n\n\u201cThe fact is that I\u2019m a different person than I was a year ago, so I am relearning how I react to things and how I respond, how I act and communicate,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of TBI (traumatic brain injury) survivors will get frustrated with themselves for how they act. \u2018New normal\u2019 gets thrown around a lot. For me, it\u2019s just who I am.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s grateful his team stood by him. Alexandre offered him a contract for 2015 mere days after the crash, knowing Crane wasn\u2019t likely to return to competition this year.\n\n\u201cI knew it was going to be very difficult for him to race again at this level this year,\u201d Alexandre said. \u201cBut he was part of the team, and he is part of the team. When he had the accident, I wanted to do what I\u2019d expect if my kids in 20 years race bikes, that somebody who is in charge would do that for my kids.\u201d\n\nCrane never blamed the tour or the driver of the car he hit. He didn\u2019t want to sue anybody. He is determined to accentuate the positive.\n\n\u201cHonestly it\u2019s just the type of person I am,\u201d Crane said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a way that I can keep myself motivated to continue to improve and get better. I take responsibility for how my loved ones are handling it as well. The outward positivity not only affects myself but plays a big role in how my family and my girlfriend are able to see it and handle it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very easy for a traumatic situation like this to cast a pretty dark light on, not only the people involved, but the race and the state. The easier option is what people go for, to blame other people, to sue people. But for me it just made more sense to have a more positive attitude toward this.\u201d\n\nCrane and Alexandre have gone out of their way to praise the emergency treatment Crane received at the scene and the care he got at St. Anthony\u2019s.\n\n\u201cWithin 30 minutes he was inside of the hospital,\u201d Alexandre said. \u201cOther places in the world, he may be dead. It\u2019s something I will never forget, seeing him on the ground with all the blood around him.\u201d\n\nJohn Meyer: jmeyer@denverpost.com or twitter.com/johnmeyer\n\nMonday\u2019s stage 1\n\nDistance: 96.6 miles\n\nStart time: About 11:47 a.m.\n\nProjected finish time: 3:15-4:10 p.m.\n\nWhere: Neutral start at Lincoln Avenue at the courthouse in Steamboat Springs.
