Jim Hoft is a well-known and highly-regarded conservative writer and blogger who frequently covers pro-life issues at his blog Gateway Pundit, based in St. Louis, Missouri.

In August, Jim became very sick and thought he had a cold. After losing vision in one eye, he checked himself into a hospital and eventually found how he was suffering from Strep bacteria poisoning his bloodstream. The bacteria eventually left him unable to see in his left eye, it created a hole in his heart and caused him to suffer five strokes.

Dr. Lee, co-director at the Center for Comprehensive Cardiovascular Care at Saint Louis University Hospital, eventually had to perform a 12-hour open heart surgery on Jim that saved his life.

Jim is clearly someone who needs good health insurance coverage to face the medical problems and issues his illness has caused, including having to remove a prosthetic leg. But, thanks to Obamacare, Jim is now without health insurance.
