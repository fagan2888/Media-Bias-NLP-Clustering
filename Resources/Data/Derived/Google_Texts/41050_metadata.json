In fact, his party has only chosen two Catholics for vice president and neither won that office (William Miller and Paul Ryan).\n\nBy contrast, the Democrats have named three for president (Al Smith, the sole Catholic president John F. Kennedy, and John Kerry) and four for vice president (Edmund Muskie, Sargent Shriver, Geraldine Ferraro, and the only one to serve, incumbent Joseph Biden).\n\nConservative writer Ira Stoll is right on top of things, pondering on Dec. 29 over at the libertarian reason.com site how Bush would handle the \u201cCatholic question.\"\n\nFor example, a 2013 Bush speech quoted in The Miami Herald said his views on immigration reflect \u201cwhat my church teaches me.\u201d That puts him to the left of the GOP field on the issue, and such remarks may trouble citizens who agree with President John F. Kennedy\u2019s wariness toward any religious influences in public policy.\n\nOn the other hand, Bush has criticized President Barack Obama\u2019s new U.S. outreach to Cuba, which Stoll says creates an \u201cimplicit\u201d contrast with \u201cthe foreign policy of Pope Francis.\u201d In addition, Francis is expected to soon unite with the political left on global warming, which would rile the Republican \u201cbase.\u201d Bush may end up as a \u201ccafeteria Catholic\u201d who picks and chooses which of the church\u2019s social teachings to support.\n\nOr should we speak of a new kind of \u201cCuomo Catholicism,\u201d a term coined in a 2011 National Catholic Reporter commentary by the estimable Ken Briggs (a friend of mine since his years with Newsday and The New York Times)?\n\nFormer New York Governor Mario Cuomo, who died Jan 1, was a Catholic who famously favored liberal abortion laws though he \u201cpersonally opposed\u201d the practice. In the same way, Briggs observed, his son Andrew, currently New York governor and a possible presidential aspirant, opposes the church\u2019s stance (doctrines?) against same-sex marriage.\n\nFor Briggs, the two Cuomos are part of \u201ca growing movement among lay Catholics to consider their own counsel on moral matters while retaining their identity as Catholics, refusing to label themselves as outcasts.\u201d\n\nIn Briggs\u2019s opinion, with attempted conformity and \u201clitmus tests\u201d on contested moral issues \u201cchurches fall into rigidity and judgmentalism\u201d that has proven \u201cfutile\u201d and obscures their message of salvation. Conservatives may wonder whether that\u2019s likewise true with stands that religious liberals take on -- Jeb take note -- Cuba, immigration, or global warming.\n\nAt one time, of course, Catholic America was fused at the hip with the Democratic Party. But in recent decades church-going Catholics (except for Hispanics) have emerged as a key swing bloc and the political math says a Republican cannot win the White House without taking a majority of them.\n\nJust so, Republican hopefuls depend on a solid majority of Protestant churchgoers (except for solidly Democratic-voting African-Americans) while Democratic candidates must appeal to the growing ranks of non-religious Americans.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It's time for reporters to start preparing themselves for a new \u201creligious \r\nissue\u201d if, as expected, Jeb Bush runs for U.S. president.\r\n\r\nBush, a former Episcopalian who converted to wife Columba\u2019s church in 1995, \r\ncould become the first Roman Catholic to win the Republican nomination.
