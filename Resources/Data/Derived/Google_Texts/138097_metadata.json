The department awarded $150 million in July, just months before the federal healthcare.gov website rolled out and promptly stalled.\n\nDHHS said in 2013 the grants would enable community health centers to hire 40 workers to assist 26,474 Wisconsinites enroll in Obamacare. That\u2019s about $44,250 per employee, or $66 per enrollee.\n\nAs of Nov. 30, only 5,303 people have made it through the application process and selected plans through any means \u2013 health insurance agent, navigator, at home or through a community health center.\n\nA spokesman for Health Resources and Services Administration, the division of DHHS that administers the grant program, said the department would not know until late January how many Wisconsinites actually signed up for Obamacare through community health centers.\n\nHRSA did say that between July 1 and Sept. 30, grants to community centers helped 230 individuals enroll into the state Medicaid program.\n\nEllyn McKenzie, spokeswoman for 16th Street Community Health Center in Milwaukee, said they hired three \u201coutreach and enrollment specialists\u201d with the original $159,419 grant and expect to bring on two more in 2014. She was unable to say how many people have signed up for health insurance, however.\n\n\u201cOne worker is only able to help about four people a day,\u201d she said. \u201cSomeone sits down (with an uninsured person) and helps them get through the website.\u201d\n\nAt 20 people a week, the most an enrollment specialist \u2014 not to be confused with a licensed Obamacare navigator \u2014 could have signed up for health insurance to this point is about 220 people.\n\nMultiply that by the 35 employees who were actually hired with federal grant money, and about 7,700 Wisconsinites should have signed up for health insurance through community health centers. But that has not happened.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s entirely possible we fall short (of our enrollment goal) because of the chaotic way things have gone with the website and the BadgerCare delay,\u201d McKenzie said. \u201cWe have paper applications. We were doing over-the-telephone application,s too. The last I heard, people are getting signed up, looking at their options and saying \u2018you know I\u2019m going to think about this. I need to decide if this is something I\u2019m going to do.\u2019\u201d\n\nContact Ryan Ekvall at rekvall@watchdog.org, by phone at 608-257-1382 or on Twitter @Nockian.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "The federal government sends another $58 million to community health centers to enroll people in Obamacare.", "title": "Wisconsin gets more federal money to sell Obamacare - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/11/obamacare-enrollment.jpg", "updated_time": "2013-12-16T13:15:38+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/120556/obamacare-federal-grants/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Health Care", "tag": "community health centers,grants,HRSA,Kathleen Sebelius,ObamaCare,Taxpayer", "published_time": "2013-12-17T04:00:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-12-16T13:15:38+00:00"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "The federal government sends another $58 million to community health centers to enroll people in Obamacare.", "title": "Wisconsin gets more federal money to sell Obamacare - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/11/obamacare-enrollment.jpg"}, "creator": "@watchdogorg", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "description": "The federal government sends another $58 million to community health centers to enroll people in Obamacare."}, "article_summary": "By Ryan Ekvall | Wisconsin ReporterMADISON, Wis. \u2014 Sixteen Wisconsin community health centers will receive an extra $926,141 in 2014 to keep spreading the word about Obamacare.\nDHHS said in 2013 the grants would enable community health centers to hire 40 workers to assist 26,474 Wisconsinites enroll in Obamacare.\nMultiply that by the 35 employees who were actually hired with federal grant money, and about 7,700 Wisconsinites should have signed up for health insurance through community health centers.\nThe federal Department of Health and Human Services announced last week they\u2019d send over another $58 million in one-time grants to community health centers across the nation.\nHRSA did say that between July 1 and Sept. 30, grants to community centers helped 230 individuals enroll into the state Medicaid program."}
