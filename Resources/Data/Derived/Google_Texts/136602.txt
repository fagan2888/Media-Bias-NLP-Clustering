In 1953, Gallup asked Americans if they would prefer a male or female boss, and the guys won in a landslide. But the U.S. was a different country back then. Eighty-five percent of men worked compared to just 35 percent of women, and a female CEO was practically unheard of.

In the last 60 years, the male/female boss gap has narrowed from 61 points to just 12 points. Americans still prefer male bosses over female bosses. But today, two-thirds of respondents say they prefer female bosses or just don't care in the first place. "The 23% of Americans who would opt to work for a woman is the highest in the history of Gallup's asking this question since 1953," Gallup reports.

There are three more fascinating points to make from Gallup's more detailed data that breaks down respondents by gender, education, age, party, and current boss.
