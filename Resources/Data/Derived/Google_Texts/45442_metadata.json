Kinne, a clinical gerontologist who spent 23 years in executive-level positions at Fortune 500 managed care companies including accountable care organizations (ACOs) and health maintenance organizations (HMOs), knew that with the shifting healthcare landscape, post-ACA, business had to change.\n\nMichael Kinne\n\n\u201cProviders, in the old days, used to discharge people into the community and had no idea what happened in the form of follow-up. With managed care companies, physical health was the focus, but there was nothing regarding behavioral or mental health,\u201d Kinne says. \u201cNow things have changed, so you can\u2019t make money by doing a bunch of stuff. You have to improve quality and outcomes. And that\u2019s how it always should have been, but it took us a while to get there,\u201d he says.\n\nFast-forward to the contract award from HFS. The utilization of health IT to support NLHP\u2019s community-based care model became a necessity, notes Kinne. As such, NLHP partnered with the New York City-based Virtual Health to implement a cloud-based care coordination system providing a high-tech solution to support NLHP\u2019s high-touch care coordination strategy. Note: this project was recognized as a semifinalist in the 2015 Healthcare Informatics Innovator Awards Program.\n\n\u201cThis platform gives everyone in the healthcare ecosystem\u2014whether you\u2019re a payer or provider or patient or caregiver or coordinator\u2014a full Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)-compliant view about what\u2019s going on with that patient,\u201d says Kinne. \u201cBack in the day before the Internet, we had the intranet, where you could communicate great with the people in your college. Then the Internet allowed you to communicate from college to college to college. Facebook took that model and ran with it, and that\u2019s what\u2019s being created here. Obviously this isn\u2019t for social media, but in terms of imagery that\u2019s how you could look at it,\u201d says Kinne.\n\nCommunity-Based Care\n\nNLHP takes care of two distinct populations in Cook County, Illinois\u2014seniors with disabilities and newly eligible ACA adults, who previously were not eligible for Medicaid, but now have insurance for the first time ever. Historically, Kinne notes, you had a very hostile provider network that didn\u2019t want to see these patients as they were very difficult to treat, and the physicians wouldn\u2019t be reimbursed for their care. But now since these patients are insured, providers are finding out more about them, starting with the fact that they have enormous amounts of behavioral and mental health needs.\n\nAs such, NLHP now has the ability to take in all of the historical claims data on these patients, any encounters they might have had, and automatically have it risk-stratified using the chronic illness and disability payment system (CDPS), the Medicaid-specific risk adjustment system. \u201cWe can use that in the field at the moment we have the membership in the platform\u2014it\u2019s automatically risk-stratified,\u201d Kinne says. \u201cWe know everything that has happened to them previously, we know what their patterns of care looks like, what their cost looks like, and it gives us insight into what\u2019s been happening. We\u2019re going from playing Checkers to playing Chess. The idea is to think five or six moves ahead so that we can avoid easily avoidable high-expense items such as intuitional care,\u201d says Kinne.\n\nNLHP\u2019s three-fold care teams\u2014made up of a nurse, a behavioral or mental health specialist, and a community health worker\u2014are equipped with tablets and mobile phones, giving them the ability to have the full breadth of the technology platform\u2019s capabilities while accessing members at their homes, at providers\u2019 offices, at hospitals, and at various community-based sites, notes Kinne. What\u2019s more, the platform provides real-time communication and data exchange across various entities within the healthcare continuum to empower care coordinators and providers to improve health outcomes for NLHP members, their households, and communities, he says. \u201cI can tell a care team member to go to a person\u2019s house, and I can note where they are at a given moment to look at their efficiency and effectiveness,\u201d Kinne says. \u201cWe want to bring the medical home to the patient rather than what they\u2019re used to, which is going to the ER,\u201d he says.\n\nNLHP\u2019s clinical team of nurses, care managers and a PhD-level epidemiologist worked with the Virtual Health team to build out the necessary tools, algorithms, dashboards, and business rules, allowing for innovations in risk stratification, population management and use of data analytics to provide actionable interventions. As a result, to date, NLHP has been able to actionably engage with more than 50 percent of its member population in a matter of months, a statistic that is a far outlier among care coordination given the transient nature of the member population, its officials say.", "article_metadata": {"com.silverpop.cothost": "engage4.silverpop.com", "com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages04.net,assistedhousingfinancialinsider.com,assistedhousinginsider.com,commercialleaselawinsider.com,constructionsuperconference.com,efaconference.com,secure.rhq.com,secure2.rhq.com,www.addictionpro.com,www.apartmentlawinsider.com,www.assistedhousinginsider.com,www.behavioral.net,www.commercialleaselawinsider.com,www.commercialtenantsleaseinsider.com,www.communityassociationinsider.com,www.constructionsuperconference.com,www.entjournal.com,www.environmentsforaging.com,www.etouches.com,www.fairhousingcoach.com,www.hcd11.com,www.healthcare-informatics.com,www.healthcarebuildingideas.com,www.healthcaredesignmagazine.com,www.herdjournal.com,www.ihealthtran.com,www.landlordvtenant.com,www.ltlmagazine.com,www.nycapartmentlaw.com,www.taxcredithousinginsider.com,www.vendomegrp.com,www.vendomerealestatemedia.com", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe03b8\"", "article_summary": "With managed care companies, physical health was the focus, but there was nothing regarding behavioral or mental health,\u201d Kinne says.\nAs such, NLHP partnered with the New York City-based Virtual Health to implement a cloud-based care coordination system providing a high-tech solution to support NLHP\u2019s high-touch care coordination strategy.\nFacebook took that model and ran with it, and that\u2019s what\u2019s being created here.\nThen the Internet allowed you to communicate from college to college to college.\nThe utilization of health IT to support NLHP\u2019s community-based care model became a necessity, notes Kinne."}
