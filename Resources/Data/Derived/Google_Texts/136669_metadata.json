Edsall analyses a bunch of polls throughout the article, but what he finds troubling I find to be good common sense. For example, most Americans aren't incredibly trusting of their government:\n\nEven worse for Democrats, the Saez paper found that \u201cinformation about inequality also makes respondents trust government less,\u201d decreasing \u201cby nearly twenty percent the share of respondents who \u2018trust government\u2019 most of the time:\u201d\n\nSmart thinking.\n\nFurthermore, most Americans aren\u2019t convinced that Obamacare is going to be the shining, efficient, cheaper, all-inclusive beacon of hope it was promised to be:\n\nAn earlier New York Times poll, conducted in December 2013, found that 52 percent of those surveyed believed that the Affordable Care Act would increase their medical costs; 14 percent said it would reduce costs. Thirty-six percent believed that Obamacare would worsen the quality of health care compared to 17 percent who thought it would improve it.\n\nAlso probably wise.\n\nOn the whole Edsall appears to understand people\u2019s perceptions of government care (to my relief and his dismay) quite well \u2013 except for in one area.\n\nEsdall claims the \u201cmost dramatic\u201d change in public opinion has been people\u2019s perception of the \u2018right\u2019 to healthcare. He cites the two Gallup polls in an attempt to claim that majority support for guaranteed access to health coverage has dropped radically over the past six years:\n\nThe erosion of the belief in health care as a government-protected right is perhaps the most dramatic reflection of these trends. In 2006, by a margin of more than two to one, 69-28, those surveyed by Gallup said that the federal government should guarantee health care coverage for all citizens of the United States. By late 2014, however, Gallup found that this percentage had fallen 24 points to 45 percent, while the percentage of respondents who said health care is not a federal responsibility nearly doubled to 52 percent.\n\nBut Esdall isn\u2019t comparing apples with apples. The belief that in a developed society everyone should have access to basic healthcare provisions is not the same as believing that healthcare is a federal responsibility \u2013 especially in the United States.\n\nThe debate is not \u2013 and has not been for a long time \u2013 whether or not people should have access to healthcare, but rather how that care should be provided. What kind of delivery of healthcare will create the cheapest prices and best outcomes, and what safety net for those at the bottom will provide the most comprehensive care?\n\nThere is huge demand in the States for healthcare reform, and most people want this reform to focus on cheaper access to care. But that can be achieved without fully handing healthcare provision over to the federal government or adopting something that resembles the NHS.\n\nBoth the US and the UK should be looking to countries that rank highest for healthcare provisions internationally, which have almost all settled on systems where the central government funds healthcare but does not directly provide healthcare. The Netherlands, Denmark, Switzerland, and Germany all have healthy relationships with private companies, ranging from insurance companies and charities, that provide better outcomes than those in the UK and in a cheaper, more efficient manner than in the US.\n\nSupport for universal access to healthcare and support for market mechanisms in healthcare are not mutually exclusive; there's plenty of evidence to suggest a combination of the two creates the best healthcare systems in the world.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Adam Smith Institute", "description": "An op-ed\u00a0published last week in the New York Times laments Americans' \r\ndecline in support for government involvement in the redistribution of \r\nwealth - or, as the Times author Thomas Edsall calls it, \u2018sharing\u2019.
