Released in 2013, Kerik now runs a crisis-management consulting group and advocates for criminal justice reform.\n\nHe recently sat down with Reason TV's Nick Gillespie to discuss the Michael Brown shooting in Ferguson, the militarization of police, the effect of the drug war on law enforcement, and what it's like to be prosecuted in today's America.\n\n\"Every high school student in America, before they graduate high school,\" says Kerik, \"should be forced to read [Reason Contributor Harvey] Silverglate's book [Three Felonies a Day].
