And go figure, I could draw,\u201d she said. Her drawings range from Star Wars spaceships to accurately rendered skeletal structures of animals. She was doing quick business Friday morning.\n\n\u201cGod, it beats bartending,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a museum to me,\u201d said Nancy Darnell, 59, a visitor from Lakewood who has missed only one of the 25 festivals. Having just purchased a hat from Frisco artist Diane Harty, Darnell sat on a bench \u2014 map and pen in hand \u2014 and planned her next move. \u201cSome aren\u2019t even here for the art. They just like the camaraderie of other people.\u201d\n\nArtists mingled with festivalgoers in the shade of the white tents, a rare and welcome opportunity for many who typically labor in solitude.\n\n\u201cThe creators are right here for people to go and talk to and meet with,\u201d said Tara Brickell, interim executive director of the festival. \u201cI think this is a grand tradition of Denver.\u201d\n\nPart of the festival\u2019s mission is to provide educational outreach in Colorado, she said, and a piece of the effort was on display at the Janus Student Art Buying Showcase. Janus, one of the event\u2019s sponsors, provided a number of student groups with $500 each to purchase pieces of art to be displayed in their schools. The groups then talked about the pieces they chose.\n\nHillary Holcomb and Halie Hall, both 16, were part of the art-buying team for Denver School of the Arts. The team purchased four pieces with their budget \u2014 and came away with new ideas of their own.\n\n\u201cBeing an artist, you get some inspiration\u201d at the festival, Holcomb said. She said she has been coming to the festival \u201csince I was walking \u2014 forever.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing to do,\u201d said John Pederson, 67, of Denver, who has been coming to the festival for 16 years. \u201cNow it\u2019s a fun thing to do with the grandkids.\n\n\u201cThey like coming out here and just gawking at stuff.\u201d\n\nMatthew Nussbaum: 303-954-1666, mnussbaum@denverpost.com or twitter.com/MatthewNussbaum", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Cherry Creek Arts Fest in Denver begins 25th year under sunny skies", "title": "Cherry Creek Arts Fest in Denver begins 25th year under sunny skies", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/07/03/cherry-creek-arts-fest-in-denver-begins-25th-year-under-sunny-skies/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150703__CD03CCARTSFEST_BL25261xp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150703__CD03CCARTSFEST_BL25261xp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-03T16:18:12+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T23:30:15+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2a6c\"", "article_summary": "The 25th annual Cherry Creek Arts Festival kicked off Friday, bringing out thousands of people on a glorious summer day.\nHillary Holcomb and Halie Hall, both 16, were part of the art-buying team for Denver School of the Arts.\nThe team purchased four pieces with their budget \u2014 and came away with new ideas of their own.\n\u201cI think this is a grand tradition of Denver.\u201dPart of the festival\u2019s mission is to provide educational outreach in Colorado, she said, and a piece of the effort was on display at the Janus Student Art Buying Showcase.\nOf the 2,000 or so artists who applied, only 260 were chosen to display their creations."}
