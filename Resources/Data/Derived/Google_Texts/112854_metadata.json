Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Ford, Carter (even), Reagan, Bush, Clinton, Bush. All practiced politics inside the tensions between Congress and the presidency that were designed into the system by the Founding Fathers. Not Barack Obama. He told us he was different. He is.\n\nMr. Obama doesn't do Washington's politics. Disappointed acolytes say it is because he is \"passive.\" That underestimates him. For Mr. Obama, the affairs of state are wholly a function of whatever is inside his mind.\n\nSome things remain in his mind, like the economic benefits of public infrastructure spending, which appeared one more time in Monday's post-Navy Yard speech on the lessons of the financial crisis and Congress's obligations to agree with him. Some things enter his mind and then depart, like red lines in the Syrian sand.\n\nFrom where he sits, it is the job of the political world outside to adjust and conform to the course of the president's mental orbit. Those who won't adjust are dealt with by the president himself. They are attacked publicly until they are too weak politically to oppose what is on his mind.\n\nThis is the unique Obama M.O. For historians of the Obama presidency, this September has been a case study in the 44th president's modus operandi.\n\nENLARGE Martin Kozlowski\n\nEarly in September, President Obama surprised Washington by announcing he would seek a congressional vote of support for taking action against Bashar Assad in Syria. This came after the red line went. In an account of that decision, The Wall Street Journal reported that after taking a 45-minute walk with his chief of staff, Mr. Obama told his staff, \"I have a big idea I want to run by you guys.\"\n\nAfter meeting with the president, two significant political figures in Washington expressed public support for his announced plans to act against Assad\u2014House Speaker John Boehner and Majority Leader Eric Cantor.\n\nThe president's decision to intervene wasn't popular with the American public or with members of Congress, so the Boehner-Cantor commitment was a big deal. It was a public expression of political support at the moment the president needed all the political support he could get.\n\nA week and a half later, Mr. Obama reversed course. He would not seek congressional approval. Instead it occurred to him that he could negotiate a Syrian chemical-arms reduction agreement with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The merits of that decision aside, ABC's Jonathan Karl reported that neither Mr. Boehner nor Mr. Cantor got a heads up from the White House on the U-turn toward Russia.\n\nThrow a dart at the names of the other 11 post-war U.S. presidents. Would any of them have hung a Speaker of the House out to dry just before heading into negotiations with that speaker on funding the government, extending the debt ceiling or the future of your legacy achievement\u2014ObamaCare? Barack Obama did. No problem.\n\nRelated Video Wonder Land columnist Dan Henninger on why Tea Party Republicans are backing away from a plan to link budget talks with a bid to defund ObamaCare. Photo: Associated Press\n\nOn Monday, Mr. Obama delivered what the White House called \"Remarks by the President at the Five-Year Anniversary of the Financial Crisis.\" After waving in the direction of the Navy Yard shooting and then the 2008 financial crisis, Mr. Obama spent most of the speech's nearly 4,000 words ripping into the congressional Republicans.\n\nYou have to read it to get the flavor. This passage should stand as a classic of the Obama politics of anti-politics: \"The problem is at the moment, Republicans in Congress don't seem to be focused on how to grow the economy and build the middle class. I say 'at the moment' because I'm still hoping that a light bulb goes off here.\" (Laughter from the invited props.)\n\nGridlock? He's sucking the political oxygen out of the city.\n\nThere's plenty more. \"The last time the same crew threatened this course of action . . . .\" The same crew? As a bonus, we're getting a post-modern presidential vocabulary.\n\n\". . . they're willing to tank the entire economy.\"\n\n\"Are they really willing to hurt people just to score political points?\"\n\nThe GOP leaders \"haven't put forward serious ideas\" on entitlement reform. And: \"I put forward ideas for tax reform\u2014haven't heard back from them yet.\" As with much else here, everyone in Washington knows that statement about taxes is false. But in the Obama post-politics apocalypse, what difference does it make?\n\nTwice he announces, \"I will not negotiate.\" But he is negotiating with Vladimir Putin something infinitely more difficult than a debt deal with John Boehner.\n\nTrace elements of normal politics are inevitable in any presidency. But this one over five years has floated beyond the American political tradition. The Obama modus operandi is reducible to this: I think, therefore you do. Everyone else who still does real politics\u2014from one side to the other\u2014is left to gape.\n\nWrite to henninger@wsj.com", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "article.created": "2013-09-18T23:12:00.000Z", "article.section": "Opinion", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "Article", "twitter": {"domain": "wsj.com", "description": "In The Wall Street Journal, Wonder Land columnist Daniel Henninger writes that Barack Obama's modus operandi is: I think, therefore you do.", "creator": "@danhenninger", "image": {"src": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/ED-AR274_WL0919_G_20130918182446.jpg", "alt": "Daniel Henninger: The Obama M.O.", "identifier": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/ED-AR274_WL0919_D_20130918182446.jpg"}, "title": "Daniel Henninger: The Obama M.O.", "site": "@WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "wsj://launch?articleid=SB10001424127887323808204579083344033869268&headline=Daniel%20Henninger%3A%20The%20Obama%20M.O.&weburl=http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323808204579083344033869268"}}, "page.site.product": "WSJ", "keywords": "Barack Obama,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,content types,commentary,opinion,factiva filters,fc&e executive news filter", "news_keywords": "Barack Obama,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,content types,commentary,opinion,factiva filters", "article.headline": "Daniel Henninger: The Obama M.O.", "cXenseParse": {"candybar": {"image": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/ED-AR274_WL0919_E_20130918182446.jpg"}, "poptart": {"image": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/ED-AR274_WL0919_D_20130918182446.jpg"}}, "description": "In The Wall Street Journal, Wonder Land columnist Daniel Henninger writes that Barack Obama's modus operandi is: I think, therefore you do.", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=364387007,app-argument=wsj://launch?articleid=SB10001424127887323808204579083344033869268&headline=Daniel%20Henninger%3A%20The%20Obama%20M.O.&weburl=http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323808204579083344033869268", "user.type": "nonsubscriber", "article.page": "Opinion", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.summary": "In The Wall Street Journal, Wonder Land columnist Daniel Henninger writes that Barack Obama's modus operandi is: I think, therefore you do.", "page.site": "wsj", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2013-09-18T23:12:00.000Z", "dj.asn": "i-32ae", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"embed_count": 1, "image_count": 1, "word_count": 810, "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Article", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "In The Wall Street Journal, Wonder Land columnist Daniel Henninger writes that Barack Obama's modus operandi is: I think, therefore you do.", "title": "Daniel Henninger: The Obama M.O.", "url": "http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323808204579083344033869268", "image": {"width": 553, "identifier": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/ED-AR274_WL0919_G_20130918182446.jpg", "height": 369}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "author": "Daniel Henninger", "article.access": "free", "page.content.source": "WSJ Online Article", "article.origheadline": "Daniel Henninger: The Obama M.O.", "article.type": "Wonder Land", "article.id": "SB10001424127887323808204579083344033869268", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2013-09-18T23:12:00.000Z"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe16d7\"", "article_summary": "For Mr. Obama, the affairs of state are wholly a function of whatever is inside his mind.\nIt was a public expression of political support at the moment the president needed all the political support he could get.\nA week and a half later, Mr. Obama reversed course.\nMr. Obama doesn't do Washington's politics.\nPhoto: Associated PressOn Monday, Mr. Obama delivered what the White House called \"Remarks by the President at the Five-Year Anniversary of the Financial Crisis.\""}
