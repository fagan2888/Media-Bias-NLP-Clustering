WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) — MetLife has been fighting the “systemically important financial institution” tag for months.

But on Friday, the Financial Stability Oversight Council explained why, on a 9-to-1 vote, it chose to subject the insurer best known for its Peanuts-themed advertisements to additional oversight because of the ability for MetLife MET, -1.53% to the entire financial system at risk.

According to the council’s report, MetLife is the largest publicly-traded insurance organization and one of the largest financial service companies, with $909 billion in consolidated assets.

The council’s report said MetLife leads life insurers in certain capital markets activities, like its funding through commercial paper, and that efforts to hedge through derivatives are not just imperfect but also increase its complexity and interconnectedness.

MetLife is at risk that, if it experienced distress, it wouldn’t be able to roll over various funding agreements, which could force it to liquidate assets, notably corporate debt and asset-backed securities

In the last crisis, MetLife had the second largest amount of unrealized losses among life insurers. “Although a substantial portion of the decreases in the value of its assets remained unrealized, this experience is indicative of both the scale of MetLife’s investments and also the extent to which the value of that portfolio can fall,” the government said.

During 2008 and 2009, MetLife’s bank subsidiary tapped Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. emergency facilities numerous times.

Among the potential effects distress at MetLife could cause, the report estimated that as many as 100 million policyholders and contract holders could experience losses.

The Financial Stabliity Oversight Council is a group of federal regulators, led by the Treasury secretary, that meets to discuss risks to the financial system. MetLife joins American International Group AIG, -0.52% , Prudential Financial PRU, -1.53% and General Electric GE, -0.23% as non-banks that are subject to federal oversight.
