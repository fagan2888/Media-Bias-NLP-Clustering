The Obama administration targeted the LGBT community \u2014 among others \u2014 in particular for open enrollment. As former Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius announced in 2013, Obamacare prevents health insurance companies from charging anyone a higher premium just because of their sexual orientation \u2014 and also makes it illegal for insurance companies offering coverage through the Marketplace to discriminate based on gender identity or sexual orientation.\n\nDespite these changes, LGBT adults are still less likely to have health care \u2014 and it\u2019s possibly because LGBT Americans aren't always aware of their options, Sebelius noted. They are also more likely to report a lack of funds to afford health care, according to Gallup. Twenty-five percent of LGBT adults reported that they didn\u2019t have enough money for health care needs at least once in the past year, while only 17 percent of non-LGBT Americans reported the same problem. And the numbers are worse for LGBT women in particular, who are less likely to have a personal doctor. Twenty-nine percent of LGBT women lacked a doctor, compared to 16 percent of non-LGBT women.\n\nBut it\u2019s important for those in the LGBT community to understand their options in the Affordable Care Act. Sexual and gender minorities, after all, \u201cexperience worse physical and mental health outcomes and face unique health challenges compared to their heterosexual counterparts,\u201d Jennifer Kates and Usha Ranji write on the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation. \u201cThese include a higher prevalence of HIV, mental illness, substance use, smoking, and other health conditions.\u201d HIV/AIDS, in particular, is far more prevalent among gay and bisexual men \u2014 with that group accounting for two-thirds of new HIV infections.\n\nThe statistics of the Gallup poll are in line with those that came out in a 2013 National Health Statistics Report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Gallup's \"data suggest that LGBT adults experience hurdles in accessing health insurance and resources,\u201d the press release states.\n\nGallup continued:", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "lgbt healthcare, lgbt health, hiv/aids", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Despite attempts by Obamacare to include more LGBT Americans in open enrollment, many still report that they lack health insurance.", "title": "LGBT Women Have A Harder Time Getting Health Care And Personal Doctors", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/lgbt-americans-are-less-likely-get-health-care-personal-doctors-survey-300128", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/27/lesbian.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Despite attempts by Obamacare to include more LGBT Americans in open enrollment, many still report that they lack health insurance.", "title": "LGBT Women Have A Harder Time Getting Health Care And Personal Doctors", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/lgbt-americans-are-less-likely-get-health-care-personal-doctors-survey-300128", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/27/lesbian.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/27/lesbian.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-08-27T16:12:35-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-27T16:12:35-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Despite attempts by Obamacare to include more LGBT Americans in open enrollment, many still report that they lack health insurance."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd5ce3\"", "article_summary": "LGBT women in particular are less likely to have health care or personal doctors, compared to non-LGBT women and Americans in general.\nDespite these changes, LGBT adults are still less likely to have health care \u2014 and it\u2019s possibly because LGBT Americans aren't always aware of their options, Sebelius noted.\nTwenty-nine percent of LGBT women lacked a doctor, compared to 16 percent of non-LGBT women.\nAnd the numbers are worse for LGBT women in particular, who are less likely to have a personal doctor.\nThey are also more likely to report a lack of funds to afford health care, according to Gallup."}
