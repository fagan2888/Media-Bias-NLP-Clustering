He also enjoys unchecked pardon power, which he\u2019s unlikely to use, but which would vastly extend the limits of his ability to draw otherwise law-abiding unauthorized immigrants out of the shadows.\n\nDespite all this, Douthat blends the assumption that Obama will be violating the law seamlessly into his column, using terms like \u201clawless\u201d and \u201cabuse of office\u201d and by invoking Yoo as a metaphor for an unscrupulous legal man-behind-the-curtain willing to write false justifications for actions a more scrupulous lawyer would deem out of bounds. But his critique is ultimately about political norms rather than legal authority.\n\n@ThePlumLineGS @jonathanchait I think the issue is that it's very hard to separate the legal issues from political norms here. \u2014 Ross Douthat (@DouthatNYT) August 3, 2014\n\nBecause without evidence that the scope of an executive action nobody has seen will exceed what\u2019s permitted under the law, what he\u2019s really arguing is that any far-reaching exercise of power in this arena will set a precedent Douthat would rather avoid. But this both a niggling point and a suspiciously limited commentary on the collapse of political norms.\n\nFor instance, Douthat shrugs off the historic dysfunction and obstructive tendencies of the GOP-controlled House with a questionable \"to be sure\" sentence\u2014\u201cIncompetence and gridlock are significant problems, indeed severe ones, but they\u2019re happening within the context of a constitutional system that allows for \u2014 and can survive \u2014 congressional inaction.\u201d But these two failing norms occupy two sides of the same coin: Unless you\u2019re going to make huge assumptions about Obama\u2019s willingness to violate the law, the only thing you can really say about Obama's intention to offer more immigrants deportation relief is that it\u2019s symptomatic of power flowing from government actors who won\u2019t use it (Republicans in Congress), to those who will (Democrats in the executive). And assuming Douthat isn't prepared to argue that Congress should get it together and enact the very kind of amnesty he\u2019s been arguing against for months, it\u2019s hard to escape the conclusion that his galvanizing concern isn\u2019t jealousy of fragile procedural norms (the Yoo reference becomes ironic when viewed in this light) but rather his substantive opposition to the kinds of actions Obama is considering.\n\nDouthat hints here and there in the column at the problems he sees with the concept of deportation relief, but those bones of contention are much less appetizing than the grave threat to the republic that serves as a backdrop for the entire piece. It would of course be hugely problematic if a president were allowed to get away with indiscriminate, clear-cut lawbreaking by using the press and political allies to neutralize the threat of impeachment. That\u2019s not what we\u2019re up against, though. And the only way to conclude otherwise is to bake an assumption that conservatives have sole claim to the legal high ground into your analysis.\n\nBut that\u2019s a false assumption. It\u2019s false with respect to immigration, because we don\u2019t know what Obama\u2019s going to do. And it\u2019s false with respect to the latest Obamacare lawsuits, where the more honest conservative claim\u2014that the text of the Affordable Care Act unambiguously prohibits subsidies in states that don\u2019t set up their own exchange\u2014is highly contestable.\n\nThis tendency to assume the legal high ground follows naturally from a political strategy of playing up unilateral executive actions as evidence of presidential lawlessness. It\u2019s tempting and convenient for conservatives to treat these as open and shut cases. But outside the right, it\u2019s best to view their efforts as sophisticated attempts to work the refs rather than as judicious and conclusive interpretations of fact.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "description": "The right is celebrating Ross Douthat\u2019s Sunday New York Times column about the interlocking politics of executive action to curb deportations, and the Democratic Party\u2019s effective efforts to troll Republicans over impeachment.
