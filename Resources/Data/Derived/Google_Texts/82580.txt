Bond has been set at $100,000 each for two teenagers held in the death of a Moselle man in Jones County.

The Chronicle reports Alex Crews and Timothy Meadows, both 17, were arrested and charged with manslaughter in the death of 44-year-old Timothy Brian Williamson.

Jones County Sheriff Alex Hodge says deputies responded to a call about a fight in progress on Wednesday night. Hodge says when deputies arrived at the scene, they found Williamson unresponsive and took the two teenagers into custody.

Hodge says authorities are still awaiting the results of an autopsy report to confirm the cause of death.

It was not immediately clear whether either of the teenagers has an attorney. They made their initial court appearance Friday.
