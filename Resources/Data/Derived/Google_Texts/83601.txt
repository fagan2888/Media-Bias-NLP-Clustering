On Sunday afternoon, the Denver and Boulder metro area tests showed good to moderate air quality, officials said.

The Winter High Pollution Advisory Program coordinated by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment issues daily winter season air pollution forecasts from October through the end of March, according to a news release by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment.

Conditions Sunday warranted no visibility or air quality advisories, noting that at 2 p.m. the air tested was of “moderate” quality.

“Respiratory symptoms possible in unusually sensitive individuals, possible aggravation of heart or lunge disease in people with cardiopulmonary disease and older adults,” the release said.

The forecast is in effect until at least 4 p.m. Monday.
