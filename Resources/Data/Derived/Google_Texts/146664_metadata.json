As we all try to come up with our New Year's resolutions, let this list of 11 absurd moments serve as a guide and a gentle reminder of the things we don't need to let happen in 2016.\n\nAs if the dozens of black men and women unjustly gunned down by police wasn't enough to cope with, there were too many times this year when the black existence and black culture was belittled in nuanced ways.\n\nAs clich\u00e9 and overused as the term \"new year, new me\" is, there are plenty of people who need to use it in the upcoming year.\n\nBen Carson comparing things to slavery. Joe Raedle via Getty Images\n\nThe republican presidential candidate thinks that the centuries of forced labor, racism and cultural displacement that this country was built upon is comparable to abortion . He also said that Obamacare is the worst thing to happen since the enslavement of an entire race. We're sure Carson will say other things that will make us give a collective side-eye before the primaries, but he can spare us the history lessons.\n\nHair-shaming black people. Steve Granitz via Getty Images\n\nMiley Cyrus, we created. Kylie Jenner and random white guys on Tumblr all received praise from mainstream media about their dreadlocks this year. However, when Zendaya wore them on the red carpet at this year's Oscars, \"Fashion Police\" co-host Giuliana Rancic said the actress' hair looked like it smelled like patchouli oil or weed. Although, Zendaya tastefully clapped back , this needs to be a lesson for the upcoming year and life in general: Don't hair-shame black people but praise white people for wearing the exact same styles\n\nRaven-Symon\u00e9 opening her mouth. \u201cI\u2019m not about to hire you if your name is \u2018Watermelondrea\u2019. It\u2019s just not gon happen!\u201d \u2014Raven-Symon\u00e9 pic.twitter.com/dE4CSlQ0ym \u2014 Ron. (@RonnieSnark) October 9, 2015\n\nFrom the former Cheetah Girl saying she'd never hire someone with a \"ghetto\" name to her scolding the teen who got dragged across a classroom floor for not putting her phone away, Raven just needs to stop talking. This shouldn't be a difficult request, especially since more than 120,000 people have signed a petition to get her removed from \"The View.\"\n\nClaiming \"all lives matter.\"\n\nPeople who say \"all lives matter\" are the same people who commit microagressions against their coworkers and classmates but don't think racial injustices still plague America. They're the same people who find solace in tweeting #WhiteGirlsAreMagic and #WhiteGirlsDoItBetter when black people assert their cultural pride. They simply miss the point of black people needing #BlackLivesMatter #BlackGirlsRock and so many other movements and campaigns to empower themselves.\n\nOversaturated dance crazes. A video posted by Carolina Panthers (@panthers) on Dec 6, 2015 at 9:06pm PST\n\nRest in peace to the \"Nae Nae,\" the \"whip,\" the \"dab\" and any other dance craze started by black people and ruined by white people. These dances are constantly ran into the ground by the reporters who don't give proper credit to their originators and the rhythmless people who try them and fail miserably. Next time you see a popping dance you want to emulate, make sure you're moving on the two and four and not the one and three\n\nFetishizing mixed and light skin children.\n\nShowing preference to lighter shades of skin or mixed children is problematic and it needs to be nipped in the bud once and for all. Comedian and blogger Franchesca Ramsey completely nailed the issue when she said, \"This idea that being partially white is somehow more attractive or more desirable basically says that blackness is not attractive or desirable.\" This ideology is not only wrong but it's a product of bigotry that has lasted for centuries. Yes, kids with lighter complexions are cute, but so are kids with darker complexions and every shade in between.\n\nWhite people getting mad when Obama said n****r.\n\nDreams from My Father, and it probably won't be the last. Listen to The people who got mad when President Barack Obama said the n-word in a conversation about race didn't listen to the message behind what he said. \"Racism, we are not cured of it,\" POTUS said in an interview . \"And it's not just a matter of it not being polite to say nigger in public.\" Though Obama addressed that there are deeper issues that need to be solved than just the word itself, people were still furious, and said that he shouldn't have said the word in the first place. This isn't the first time Obama has used the word, it appears several times in his book,and it probably won't be the last. Listen to Marc Lamont Hill's comments during a CNN segment on black people using the n-word and deal with it.\n\nTaylor Swift's \"Wildest Dreams\" video. YouTube\n\nNo people of color. From the all-white cast to the fashion, this video romanticizes a colonized African country. The erasure of black lives in black spaces for mainstream profit has to come to an end. When Swift released her video for \" Wildest Dreams ,\" which was filmed in Africa, it featured beautiful shots of a white couple falling in love, along with animals and a gorgeous landscape. There was only one problem:. From the all-white cast to the fashion, this video romanticizes a colonized African country. The erasure of black lives in black spaces for mainstream profit has to come to an end.\n\n#Damonsplaining. #damonsplaining \"Matt Damon trying to school the producer of Dear White People on diversity in Hollywood.\" @MrPooni pic.twitter.com/guC8edAyj1 \u2014 \u1274\u12a6\u1264\u1235\u1273 (\u8449\u980c\u6069) (@teobesta) September 14, 2015\n\nInstead of listening to seasoned director Effie Brown's viewpoints on diversity in film, Matt Damon cut her off to explain diversity should only apply to the cast of the film, not those who make the film. Damon received lots of criticism on social media for his comments and issued an \"apology.\" Judging by Hollywood's dismal diversity numbers , white men need to do the exact opposite of Damonsplaining next year.\n\nScalia\u2019s comments on black students attending \u201cslower\u201d colleges. Alex Wong via Getty Images\n\nDuring the affirmative action case Fisher v. University of Texas, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia argued that black students belong in \"slower-track\" colleges. Black graduates called out Scalia's inaccurate comments with the hashtag #StayMadAbby , in which they tweeted photos of themselves in their caps and gowns. Scalia's argument was insulting and there's no room for this kind of ignorance in 2016.\n\nWondering why \u201cThe Wiz\u201d has an all-black cast.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Do better.", "sailthru.expire_date": "2015-12-15 12:44:14 -0500", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "Do better.", "title": "11 Ridiculous Moments From This Year We Don't Want To See In 2016", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/11-ridiculous-moments-from-this-year-we-dont-want-to-see-in-2016_us_5669d4f7e4b009377b24442f", "image": "http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/2000_1000/566ede121f00002d00e9ba7d.jpeg?cache=xrojnjzhe5", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Do better.", "title": "11 Ridiculous Moments From This Year We Don't Want To See In 2016", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/2000_1000/566ede121f00002d00e9ba7d.jpeg?cache=xrojnjzhe5", "height": 1000}, "creator": "@_tarynitup", "site": "@blackvoices", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-12-14 12:44:14 -0500", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=us_5669d4f7e4b009377b24442f", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "black-voices", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "Matt Damon,Supreme Court Justice,antonin scalia,race,dab,appropriation,ben carson,Raven-Symone,Taylor Swift ,zendaya,the wiz", "article": {"section": "Black Voices", "tag": "Matt Damon,Supreme Court Justice,antonin scalia,race,dab,appropriation,ben carson,Raven-Symone,Taylor Swift ,zendaya,the wiz", "published_time": "2015-12-14 12:44:14 -0500", "modified_time": "2015-12-14 12:44:14 -0500", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/taryn.finley"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "article_summary": "As we all try to come up with our New Year's resolutions, let this list of 11 absurd moments serve as a guide and a gentle reminder of the things we don't need to let happen in 2016.\nThe erasure of black lives in black spaces for mainstream profit has to come to an end.\nJudging by Hollywood's dismal diversity numbers , white men need to do the exact opposite of Damonsplaining next year.\nScalia's argument was insulting and there's no room for this kind of ignorance in 2016.\nListen to Marc Lamont Hill's comments during a CNN segment on black people using the n-word and deal with it."}
