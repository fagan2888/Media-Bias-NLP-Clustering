The announcement this week of this new \u201cearly access\u201d option from the federal Department of Health and Human Services didn\u2019t give a specific date in October when this will happen.\n\nLinda Schwimmer, vice president of the New Jersey Health Care Quality Institute, said the HHS early access program \u201cis a good opportunity for New Jersey employers and brokers to try it out before open enrollment starts. It was smart to pick New Jersey, because we have a 20-year history of a robust small employer market.\u201d\n\nWard Sanders, president of the New Jersey Association of Health Plans, also said New Jersey was a good choice for the HHS early access program, since the state \"has had standardized products and other elements of reform for years. It is probably a good pick for early access. If successful, it will add another tool to assist consumers in shopping for coverage, and that\u2019s a good thing.\"\n\nHHS said that, as an \u201cearly access\u201d state, New Jersey\u2019s small employers will be able to use HealthCare.gov to create an account; designate an insurance agent or broker; complete an eligibility application; obtain an eligibility determination from the SHOP exchange; and upload their employee roster. But employers won\u2019t be able to start browsing SHOP plans and prices until they become available in November.\n\nRELATED: N.J. delays full small business insurance exchange\n\nMeanwhile, SHOP, or the \u201cSmall Business Health Options Program,\u201d has gotten off to a slow start in New Jersey and nationwide.\n\nErik Rettig, Northeast outreach manager for the Small Business Majority, a small business research and advocacy organization, said SHOP is not battling a popularity problem, but a lack of knowledge.\n\n\u201cNew Jersey small employers for the most part are unaware of SHOP,\u201d he said. \u201cWe've seen some interest in the New Jersey nonprofit community in SHOP enrollment, and I anticipate as SHOP becomes more accessible more folks will take advantage of it. \u201c\n\nWhile millions of individuals were able to go on online to HealthCare.gov to buy 2014 health insurance policies, small employers who wanted to use SHOP had to compete much of the 2014 application process on paper.\n\nAnd for small employers, their choice of a 2014 health plan on SHOP was severely limited: the employer was required to choose a single plan from one insurance carrier to cover all of its workers.\n\nThat one-plan restriction will remain in place when open enrollment begins for 2015 coverage. It\u2019s a sharp contrast to the shopping experience of the more than 160,000 New Jerseyans who bought individual coverage on HealthCare.gov. In 2014, individuals were able to choose among dozens of different plans from three insurers: Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey; AmeriHealth New Jersey; and Health Republic Insurance of New Jersey.\n\nClick here to subscribe to the free NJBIZ email news blasts\n\nIn June, the state Department of Banking and Insurance announced that it would delay until 2016 the full rollout of the SHOP exchange in New Jersey. Thus, small employers will have to wait until 2016 to be able to choose from a broad menu of SHOP health plans offered by several insurers.\n\nInsurance broker David Oscar with Altigro said the fact that employers are limited to just one health plan remains a major issue. In the state\u2019s traditional small group health insurance market, which operates outside SHOP, employers can choose from dozens of health plans from multiple carriers.\n\n\u201cMy prediction is that, until there is greater choice of different plan design options through the SHOP, employers will stay in the state-run small employer market,\u201d Schwimmer added.\n\nAt least this year, instead of a paper application, small employers in New Jersey will be able to apply online for SHOP health plans taking effect in 2015.\n\nOscar said none of his clients used SHOP for 2014. He said enabling small employers to go online for SHOP this time around, instead of using a paper application, would be an improvement.\n\n\u201cOur expectation is that the five states that are getting an early view of SHOP will be able to go online and enroll small employers onto SHOP,\u201d Oscar said.\n\nRELATED: Private exchanges gaining popularity in health plan world\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping it will help\u201d to move the SHOP process to an online system, he added. \u201cSo far, the brokers have been very successful in helping individuals\u201d purchase coverage at HealthCare.gov. \u201cSo I\u2019m hoping that we\u2019ll be very successful in helping with SHOP.\u201d\n\nSmall employers must purchase their health plans on SHOP in order to receive federal subsidies. Employers are eligible for subsidies if they have fewer than 25 employees, with an average wage of less than $50,000. The employer must pay at least half the cost of the employees\u2019 health insurance, and the subsidies are on a sliding scale, covering up to 50 percent of what the employer pays for the employees\u2019 health insurance.\n\nOscar warned, though, that many small New Jersey don\u2019t quality for subsidies through SHOP because their average employee wages exceed $50,000.\n\nSanders noted that eligibility for financial subsidies under the ACA requires a small employer to purchase through the SHOP and an individual to purchase on the Marketplace. \"But the SHOP will likely see less activity than the individual Marketplace for a simple reason: The eligibility for the premium subsidies for individuals affects a lot of individuals, while eligibility for the Small Business Health Care Tax Credit is rather limited. Without the subsidy business, I wouldn\u2019t anticipate a lot of business on the SHOP, at least initially.\"\n\nChristine Stearns, vice president of the New Jersey Business & Industry Association, thinks it\u2019s interesting that New Jersey was chosen to be among the five states that will pilot the HHS \u201cearly access\u201d program.\n\n\u201cSo far, there has not been a lot of interest in the SHOP from N.J. employers,\u201d she said. \u201cAdditional time may entice more employers to explore the SHOP who so far have been skeptical.\u201d\n\nRay Castro of New Jersey Policy Perspective added: \"New Jersey is very fortunate to have been selected as a demonstration project for SHOP.\n\n\"One of the biggest challenges in the Affordable Care Act will be to show that the SHOP can result in making quality insurance more affordable and accessible for small employers,\" he said. \"It remains to be seen whether the limited tax credits, pooling of employers and online services provided in SHOP will be sufficient to meet that goal, but that is the expectation. The federal government was smart to do this on a demonstration basis first before rolling out the changes nationally to avoid many of the administrative problems that occurred in the marketplace. The state is now well positioned to influence the final design of the SHOP, which will make it more likely that it will benefit New Jersey businesses and their employees. \"\n\nJoel Cantor, director of the Rutgers Center for State Health Policy, said piloting the SHOP is a good idea and he wasn't surprised that New Jersey was one of the states selected: \"We have had a well-structured market with robust choice since well before the ACA. If it functions well, the SHOP will add a nice opportunity for employers to comparison shop.\"\n\nALSO ON NJBIZ:\n\nTurnpike Authority: Expansion will be complete by Thanksgiving\n\nWhich convenience store makes the best cup of coffee?
