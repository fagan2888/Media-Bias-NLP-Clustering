The loophole is linked to Obamacare rules that will require mid- to large-size employers starting in 2015 to offer affordable health plans to employers or pay a fine.

Under the Affordable Care Act, such plans must have a so-called "minimum value," in which health plans cover around 60 percent of the costs of benefits, on average.
