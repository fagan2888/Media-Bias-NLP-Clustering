A KU bucket to begin the second half trimmed Wichita State\u2019s lead to 29-28. But WSU answered with a 12-2 spurt. Ballgame.\n\nUNSUNG STAR\n\nNo debate here. It was Evan Wessel. He\u2019d scored in double digits just four times before Sunday. Then, against Kansas, the junior hit a career-high four 3-pointers, three of them in the second half.\n\nSTAT-SHEET STUFFER\n\nTwo guys deserve mentions. Point guard Fred VanVleet had 17 points, six rebounds, six assists and four steals for Wichita State while Kansas\u2019 Devonte\u2019 Graham finished with 17 points, three assists and five steals off the bench.\n\nHIGH RISER\n\nWichita State\u2019s Tekele Cotton. The senior guard tried to throw down a one-hand slam on the 6-foot-10 Landen Lucas. Didn\u2019t quite get it. Cotton lost the ball, but it fortuitously skipped off the glass and fell through the hoop for two points. Cotton, fouled on the play, hit a free throw to tie the game at 26.\n\nCOULD HAVE GONE EITHER WAY\n\nZach Brown had just deflected a pass, and the ball was loose on the floor. Either he or KU\u2019s Kelly Oubre Jr. was going to get it as it bounced toward the scorer\u2019s table. A foot race. Brown won. And the reward: a free path to the hoop and a monster two-hand dunk.\n\nWHAT WAS THAT?\n\nThe big screen showed a close-up camera shot of a fan\u2019s T-shirt late in the game. It had the Wichita State and Kansas logos on it. Naturally, the entire crowd booed. The bipartisan culprit? Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback.\n\nOUR TAKE\n\nThe Shockers wanted it more. They got every loose ball, used their physicality to disrupt the KU offensive flow and found a way to make the big shots when it counted. The better team won.\n\nTHEY SAID IT\n\n\u201cTo me this is probably one of the biggest wins I\u2019ve been involved with being a Shocker, just because we don\u2019t get the opportunity to play KU, and we\u2019re going to the Sweet 16. Both tremendous achievements.\u201d \u2014 junior guard Ron Baker", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Omaha.com", "description": "Wichita State defeated Kansas 78-65 at the CenturyLink Center in Omaha on Sunday to advance to the Sweet 16.", "title": "Shockers play \u2018beautiful game\u2019 in advancing to Sweet 16 with win over KU", "url": "http://www.omaha.com/sports/ncaa-tournament/shockers-play-beautiful-game-in-advancing-to-sweet-with-win/article_422989b4-d0ea-11e4-8967-87d6db659bb5.html", "image": {"width": 1170, "identifier": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/omaha.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/7/f4/7f46677c-d0ea-11e4-89c0-df780e7743dd/550f4f37e278e.image.jpg?resize=1170%2C840", "height": 840}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@OWHnews", "card": "summary"}, "description": "Wichita State defeated Kansas 78-65 at the CenturyLink Center in Omaha on Sunday to advance to the Sweet 16.", "fb": {"app_id": 117714391577072}, "keywords": "ncaa-tournament,sports", "google-site-verification": "gE-kSjgMAF16OyUU3QCB0Ap0PQnFlh5oPdueJO6D2cQ", "news_keywords": "ncaa-tournament,sports"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe28f1\"", "article_summary": "A KU bucket to begin the second half trimmed Wichita State\u2019s lead to 29-28.\nKEY RUNJust when Kansas appeared close to taking control, the Shockers scored 13 of the first half\u2019s final 15 points.\nCotton, fouled on the play, hit a free throw to tie the game at 26.\nCotton lost the ball, but it fortuitously skipped off the glass and fell through the hoop for two points.\nThe senior guard tried to throw down a one-hand slam on the 6-foot-10 Landen Lucas."}
