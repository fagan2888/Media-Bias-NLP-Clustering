According to lead researcher Xiaoyong Yang, obesity is largely connected to an inability to respond to hunger, so theoretically if we could control the response, on a neurological level, then we could control obesity. In their latest study, the Yale researchers may have just turned this theory into a reality.\n\nYang and his team studied overweight and obese mice and found that they shared a similar characteristic with humans, who also carried extra body fat: They were unable to stop eating even after the sensation of hunger was long gone. This inability to stop eating isn\u2019t as much of a free choice as it is a neurological dysfunction. \u201cAlthough there is plenty of food and plenty of energy, the hunger neurons send a false message that the body needs to conserve energy, not burn it,\u201d explained Yang, as reported by Time.\n\nResearchers have long identified two distinct classifications of body fats: white fat and brown fat. Brown fat is a type of energy-burning heat creating fat that is found in the chubby little legs of newborns. This fat dissipates chemical energy as heat, according to a press release. As the children age this brown fat, which gets its coloring from its rich concentration of mitochondria, it's converted into white fat, the fat you find in the not as cute chubby legs of adults.\n\nIn their study, which is currently published in the journal Cell, the team demonstrated in animals that the neurons in the brain that control appetite also control the \u201cbrowning\u201d of white fat. \u201cThis work indicates that behavioral modifications promoted by the brain could influence how the amount of food we eat and store in fat is burned,\" Yang said.\n\nThe team found that when mice are temporarily deprived of food, their brain goes into starvation mode and sends signals to the body to conserve energy. This energy conservation was also found to be intrinsically linked to the brain\u2019s \u201chunger\u201d messages and prompted the mice\u2019s bodies to store the white fat rather than convert it to energy-rich brown fat.\n\n\u201cWe showed that hunger itself is a signal that controls the browning of white fat, so the brain can actually control the browning of white fat,\u201d Yang said. Eventually, this finding could be used to reexamine the brains of obese people and help them deal with hunger more effectively, an idea which Yang referred to as \u201ca promising possibility,\u201d in his Cell Paper Clip.\n\nSource: Yang X, Ruan H, Dietrich MO, et al.
