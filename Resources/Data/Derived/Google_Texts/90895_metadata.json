But we are celebrating the fact that we have over seven million who have signed up.\"\n\nGibbs, who is a founding partner of a strategic communications practice called The Incite Agency, said last week at a conference in Colorado that he did not expect the employer mandate portion of the Affordable Care Act to survive legal challenges.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe employer mandate requires companies with at least 50 employees to offer health insurance options. The mandate has been delayed twice already.\n\n\"I don\u2019t think the employer mandate will go into effect,\" Gibbs said in a speech at the 2014 Benefits Selling Expo.\n\n\"It\u2019s a small part of the law. I think it will be one of the first things to go.\"\n\nThe current press secretary, Jay Carney, answered Gibbs' comments Thursday, saying, \"You can make predictions all the time and they turn out not to be true.\n\nWhile Gibbs said he supports the law, he also said there was room for improvement.\n\n\u201cWe need to have an honest discussion about improving and tweaking the law,\u201d Gibbs said.\n\nFor the full story, see The Washington Post.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"article_author": "Debbie M.
