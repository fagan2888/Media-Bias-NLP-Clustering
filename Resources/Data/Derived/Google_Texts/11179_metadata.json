Parkinson in 1965. Since then many conservatives have treated it as constitutional law, deriving from it interpretive statutes about how the right should behave.\n\nToday those conservatives must feel like Hedley Lamarr in Blazing Saddles when he steps unsuspectingly out of the bathroom only to find food flying in all directions. The modern right is wrought with divisions. We\u2019ve got Tea Partiers bum-rushing the establishment, hawks trying to marginalize doves, social conservatives clambering for sandbags to plug up the libertarian deluge, and rival-voweled reformocons and reformicons warring in the streets around the American Enterprise Institute. The Republican presidential debate stage next year is likely to feature six candidates and possibly as many as fourteen.\n\nFor party whips and political unifiers, these are times of tribulation. But I have a question for those who would criticize a divided conservatism.\n\nHave you checked out the left lately?\n\nThe Obama era should have been a high watermark for American liberalism. Democrats in 2009 not only laid claim to the House, the filibuster-proof Senate, and the White House, but did so during an economic recession in which jobs vanished, wages shrank, and Wall Street was held in nearly universal contempt. Deregulation was out and stimulus was in. The table was better set for progressive ideas than at any time since the Great Depression.\n\nEarly on, liberals made three calculations that cost them dearly. First, given enough political capital to tackle either sweeping Wall Street reform or sweeping health care reform, but not both, President Obama chose the latter. The public viewed that as a diversion from the real economic issues\u2014jobs and wages\u2014and punished Democrats in the 2010 elections, releasing the left\u2019s hold on Congress.\n\nSecond, liberals hitched their fate to the economy by pledging that their policies would end the recession. They often did this in tangible terms, as when the president\u2019s economic advisors said unemployment would never exceed 8 percent if the stimulus was passed. None of this worked as planned: GDP growth was anemic, the economy stagnated, and the unemployment rate jumped to 10 percent in October 2009. It wouldn\u2019t dip below 8 percent for another three years. Democrats suffered accordingly.\n\nThird, following the placards-and-pitchforks election of 2010, Democrats began crusading against their political opponents with the desperation of a party shut out of power. The left\u2019s obsession with stopping the Tea Party became so all-consuming that it distracted from the business of crafting policy. By the 2014 election, Democrats stood for nothing beyond sticking it to the anti-Obamacare wingnuts and shadowboxing something called the War on Women. While liberals smirked at Obama Derangement Syndrome, their own derangement was in a very advanced stage.\n\nAnd that gets to the grand irony here. Liberals spent years sneering that Republicans were the party of no, out of ideas, deathly, dying, dead. This spurred conservatives and engendered a Great Awakening on the right the likes of which hasn\u2019t been seen since the Contract with America. It was liberalism that went bankrupt, with little internal dialectic and nothing to show but hatred, economic stagnation, and the same hoary tax-and-spend policies it\u2019s been trying for decades.\n\nThat lack of originality is painfully evident at the state level. In Rhode Island, the governor is looking to enact a \u201cTaylor Swift\u201d tax on vacation homes worth more than $1 million. In California, legislators are mulling over cigarette and sales tax increases. This mad impulse towards profligacy is having predictable consequences. Of the top ten job-creating states in 2014, according to Gallup, seven were under total Republican control (it would be eight if Nebraska didn\u2019t have a nonpartisan legislature). Of the ten states that created the fewest jobs, only one was under total Republican control and four were under total Democratic control.\n\nThese side-by-side economic comparisons\u2014brought to you by federalism, another great conservative idea\u2014have created a personnel shortage in the Democratic Party as voters toss out failed liberal governors. Consider that the Democrats\u2019 presidential frontrunner for 2016 is Hillary Clinton, who\u2019s been on camera without interruption since 1992 yet hasn\u2019t held elected office since 2009. Consider too that her only potential challengers are a one-term senator from Massachusetts and a former governor from Maryland whose prot\u00e9g\u00e9 was thrashed at the ballot box last year.\n\nOr consider my old pal Dannel Malloy, the new head of the Democratic Governors Association. Malloy is governor of Connecticut, an economic leper colony ranked dead last in those Gallup job creation rankings. Why let him fail upwards into the DGA, often considered a stepping stone to national prominence? Perhaps because Malloy is all Democrats have left. Only 18 Democratic governors survived last year\u2019s elections, after Republicans prevailed in blue states like Illinois and Maryland.\n\nMalloy plans to reverse this trend by doubling down on progressivism. \u201cIf you abandon being a Democrat, they will always choose the Republican in that situation,\u201d he said. In point of fact! Let\u2019s hope he holds up himself as an example and pressures other Democrats to raise taxes 77 times.\n\nNone of this is to write off Hillary Clinton or chase some permanent Republican realignment chimera. It\u2019s simply to observe that in the current snapshot of the political landscape, liberalism is as weak as it\u2019s looked in at least ten years. Presented with a searing economic recession, Republican ideas worked, Democratic ideas didn\u2019t, the public rewarded Republicans with everything except the presidency, and Democrats flew into a rage. That could change tomorrow or 50 years from now, but it remains an exhilarating and unexpected political narrative.\n\nSo Rand Paul will snipe at Jeb Bush, reform conservatives will diverge from libertarians, and the Eleventh Commandment will go unheeded. But maybe that\u2019s a good thing. Almost all of the compelling policy debates right now are happening on the right. Conservatives could put a moratorium on friendly fire and train their sights on the left, but why bother?\n\nIt\u2019s gotten so boring over there.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 1742097289343962}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "generator": "WordPress 4.4"}, "article_summary": "The left\u2019s obsession with stopping the Tea Party became so all-consuming that it distracted from the business of crafting policy.\nPresented with a searing economic recession, Republican ideas worked, Democratic ideas didn\u2019t, the public rewarded Republicans with everything except the presidency, and Democrats flew into a rage.\nThe public viewed that as a diversion from the real economic issues\u2014jobs and wages\u2014and punished Democrats in the 2010 elections, releasing the left\u2019s hold on Congress.\nThese side-by-side economic comparisons\u2014brought to you by federalism, another great conservative idea\u2014have created a personnel shortage in the Democratic Party as voters toss out failed liberal governors.\nThe Republican presidential debate stage next year is likely to feature six candidates and possibly as many as fourteen."}
