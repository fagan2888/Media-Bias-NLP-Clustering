Sam Brownback just suffered a humiliating defeat at the hands of his fellow Republicans in the State Legislature when he pressed them to approve a moderate tax increase that would help the state deal with its massive budget crisis. He might have avoided that fate if he\u2019d looked to the south and taken a lesson from Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal.\n\nJindal this week bullied lawmakers into approving a budget that jacks up the state\u2019s tax revenue by hundreds of millions of dollars but relies on a transparently bogus set of \u201ctax credits\u201d that nobody will ever see to remain \u201crevenue neutral.\u201d\n\nRelated: States Keep Using \u2018Gimmicks\u2019 to Balance Their Budgets\n\nWith the announcement of his candidacy for president expected later this month, the ability to make the claim, however disingenuous, that he had not raised taxes is essential to Jindal. He achieved it through a complicated plan that assesses a $1,600 fee on students in the state\u2019s higher education system. However, the students will receive a refundable \u201ctax credit\u201d offsetting the fee that is payable not to them but to the state university system.\n\nRepublican State Treasurer John Kennedy told The New York Times, \u201cEveryone knows it\u2019s nonsense.\u201d But, he added, \u201cIt\u2019ll make him happy, and we can always come back and get rid of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would love if we could do it another way,\" Rep. Chris Broadwater, a Republican state representative, told the Times-Picayune newspaper. \u201cI am going to be embarrassed [by this vote] when I go back home.\u201d\n\nRelated: Congress\u2019s Favorite Gimmicks for Disguising Spending\n\nAnd Broadwater, for the record, was one of the measure\u2019s strongest supporters.\n\nOutside of the state government, opinions were even harsher. Commenting on what he described as Jindal\u2019s \u201cdisgraceful fiscal legacy\u201d and his presidential ambitions in a Times-Picayune column, Louisiana State University Professor Robert Mann, former communications director for Jindal\u2019s predecessor Kathleen Blanco, wrote: \u201cHis ineptitude with budgets alone should disqualify him from supervising a small-town Dairy Queen, much less managing the U.S. government's executive branch.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Louisiana governor and presidential aspirant Bobby Jindal this week bullied the state legislature into approving a budget that jacks up the state\u2019s tax revenue by hundreds of millions of dollars but relies on a transparently bogus set of \u201ctax credits\u201d that nobody will ever see to remain \u201crevenue neutral.\u201d", "title": "Bobby Jindal\u2019s \u2018Embarrassing\u2019 Budget Tricks", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/06/12/Bobby-Jindal-s-Embarrassing-Budget-Tricks", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/04122013_Bobby_Jindal_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/06/12/Bobby-Jindal-s-Embarrassing-Budget-Tricks", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/04122013_Bobby_Jindal_article.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@rrgarver"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Louisiana governor and presidential aspirant Bobby Jindal this week bullied the state legislature into approving a budget that jacks up the state\u2019s tax revenue by hundreds of millions of dollars but relies on a transparently bogus set of \u201ctax credits\u201d that nobody will ever see to remain \u201crevenue neutral.\u201d", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "However, the students will receive a refundable \u201ctax credit\u201d offsetting the fee that is payable not to them but to the state university system.\nHe achieved it through a complicated plan that assesses a $1,600 fee on students in the state\u2019s higher education system.\nHe might have avoided that fate if he\u2019d looked to the south and taken a lesson from Louisiana Gov.\nOutside of the state government, opinions were even harsher.\nSam Brownback just suffered a humiliating defeat at the hands of his fellow Republicans in the State Legislature when he pressed them to approve a moderate tax increase that would help the state deal with its massive budget crisis."}
