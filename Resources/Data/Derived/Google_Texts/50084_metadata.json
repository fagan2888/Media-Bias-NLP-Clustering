Many have discovered it is not that different than teaching classes with a large amount of students.\n\nRepetition can become an issue as well.\n\nScott Klemmer, an associate professor of cognitive science, computer science and engineering at the University of California at San Diego, told Insider Higher Ed, \u201cWhen you run it for the 10th time, how do you have it so you can be involved in the class at the level you want without you feeling like \u2018Groundhog Day,\u2019 where you\u2019re doing the same thing over and over again?\u201d\n\nKeith Devlin, a Stanford researcher, told Inside Higher Ed that the number of students who stay in the course past the first two weeks has increased. Devlin said he has learned that MOOCs can be a lot like multiplayer online role-playing games.\n\nHe said \u201cWorld of Warcraft\u201d has been especially instructive. The game is designed in such a way that you cannot win the \u201creally cool stuff\u201d unless you work cooperatively with others. He said the same thing can be applied to online classes \u2013 students benefit by working with other students, perhaps collaborating on a project or studying together.\n\nDevlin told Insider Higher Ed that the changes he has made to his classes are \u201cabout putting students in a position where they feel comfortable forming communities.\u201d He also has changed the focus of the course from getting a good grade at the end to participating. Those who do so get a certificate, and those who complete a further \u201ctest flight\u201d program get another certificate as well as finding out what percentile of students they tested into.\n\nSome other additions to Stanford classes have been a community teaching assistant and a Linked In group for former students.\n\nPlease follow and like us:\n\nPlease Leave A Comment\n\ncomments", "article_metadata": {"description": "Stanford University professors two years into teaching MOOCs say they are starting to realize some of the promised potential of the online innovation.", "og": {"site_name": "Business Administration Information", "description": "Stanford University professors two years into teaching MOOCs say they are starting to realize some of the promised potential of the online innovation.", "title": "MOOCs Starting to Deliver on Some of The Invention\u2019s Promise - Business Administration Information", "url": "http://www.businessadministrationinformation.com/news/moocs-starting-to-deliver-on-some-of-the-inventions-promise", "image": "http://www.businessadministrationinformation.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/stanford-online1-300x300.png", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1478982362392941}, "msvalidate.01": "E97402E8C75E1396BEAE2A02AE1A06E8", "google-site-verification": "-7d0XhlweD9ac6X0iGygOuxos-tqbyEAEVk9SXNyc-Y", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "education, mooc, stanford university"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd5aa\"", "article_summary": "Some other additions to Stanford classes have been a community teaching assistant and a Linked In group for former students.\nMany have discovered it is not that different than teaching classes with a large amount of students.\nHe said the same thing can be applied to online classes \u2013 students benefit by working with other students, perhaps collaborating on a project or studying together.\nStanford University professors who are now two years into teaching Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC) say they are starting to realize some of the promised potential of the online innovation.\nSome also are reporting that they see less drop outs then they did in the first year of MOOCs."}
