The key for pharmacies, however, will be securing reimbursement from insurers for the new programs, Miller said.\n\nAlready much more than just a place to fill prescriptions, the pharmacy could become an accessible, one-stop center in the delivery of basic health care services.\n\nHealth care consumers increasingly have the option to walk in and see a pharmacist to get a flu shot, seek advice in managing chronic conditions such as diabetes, and potentially get diagnosed and treated for common ailments.\n\nAs the U.S. health care industry undergoes dramatic shifts in traditional models and places a greater emphasis on wellness and prevention, pharmacies are evolving right along with it \u2014 when they can make a business case to offer a broader range of services.\n\n\u201cWe are by far the most accessible health care professional,\u201d said David Miller, a pharmacist and owner of Keystone Pharmacy in Grand Rapids that recently launched a nutrition consulting division. \u201cYou can\u2019t just walk in and see your physician. You can see us.\u201d\n\nAt no cost \u2013 for now \u2013 Keystone customers can have access to a certified nutritionist who offers advice on diet, nutrition and overall wellness.\n\nThe service illustrates how pharmacies are stepping beyond their traditional role of dispensing medications and selling medical supplies. Many retail pharmacies large and small now provide flu shots and immunizations, consult with customers on wellness, and offer diagnostic tests such as blood pressure, blood glucose and cholesterol checks.\n\nFrom offering advice on wellness, nutrition and managing chronic illnesses, to providing simple and quick tests, pharmacies are becoming \u201ca center for health care, potentially,\u201d said Larry Wagenknecht, CEO of the Michigan Pharmacists Association.\n\n\u201cThe pharmacy is going to become a place where people can receive more than just prescriptions,\u201d Wagenknecht said. \u201cI see the pharmacy becoming more of the center for a variety of different types of health care that goes with the traditional role of dispensing pills in the bottle.\u201d\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just in the store that they\u2019re doing it.\n\nGrand Rapids-based Meijer Inc. recently added online diabetes consulting to its list of services. The website, Meijer.com/diabetes, offers information on nutrition, exercise and medication management, plus a risk assessment.\n\nIn announcing the service last month, Meijer cited data from a survey it conducted that found a need for the kind of services it and other retail pharmacies now routinely provide for diabetics.\n\nHalf of the survey\u2019s respondents felt overwhelmed in managing their diabetes and lacked a personal care plan. Forty percent said that on top of their physician visits, they are more willing to talk to a pharmacist for advice and found walk-in services for diabetics at Meijer stores useful.\n\nNine out of 10 survey respondents were unable to identify potential complications from diabetes, such as strokes, heart and kidney disease, and hypertension.\n\nIn offering advice, information and even some medical services, pharmacies can complement primary care doctors, educate patients, and \u2014 in some cases \u2014 fill in when a customer is unable to access or get to a physician.\n\nJim Mathews, chief operating officer at New Era-based HomeTown Pharmacy that operates 37 retail pharmacies across Michigan, said pharmacists are essentially taking \u201cthe next logical step as the mid-level provider.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a growing appreciation for what a pharmacy can do,\u201d Mathews said. \u201cIt\u2019s a natural extension to the way pharmacists are trained.\u201d\n\nHomeTown Pharmacy is evaluating whether to provide in-store diagnostic tests such as swabs for strep throat or the flu. Through collaborative agreements with physician practices, the pharmacy can send positive results to a customer\u2019s doctor, get back a prescription order and then dispense the medications.\n\nSimple blood tests for cholesterol and blood sugar levels are also a consideration for 2014, Mathews said. Expanding in-store basic care is becoming a necessity to compete, he said.\n\n\u201cWe want to do more of that and we are moving in that direction,\u201d Miller said. \u201cIt helps you keep up with the Joneses more than anything.\u201d\n\nSome of the large national pharmacy chains for years have been going much further and opening in-store medical clinics for primary care, staffed by nurses, nurse practitioners and physician assistants.\n\nWalgreens now operates about 400 clinics at stores in 18 states, although not in Michigan. CVS Pharmacy operates more than 650 of its MinuteClinic retail health care centers at store locations in 27 states \u2014 including several in southeast Michigan \u2014 that record 18 million patient visits annually.\n\n[RELATED: \"In era of health reform, retail clinics become part of health care delivery system,\" from Crain's Detroit Business.]\n\nAs the pharmacy\u2019s role in the health care system continues expanding, Mathews sees more of them opening in-store medical clinics. The company recently was contacted by a physician in the Kalamazoo area who had inquired about HomeTown Pharmacy providing space for an exam room at a local store.\n\n\u201cA pharmacy, to a degree, will become a walk-in medical clinic,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just makes too much sense not to have that happen.\u201d\n\nA walk-in medical clinic at a HomeTown Pharmacy location is \u201ca possibility\u201d in the future, although the company presently has \u201cno concrete plans\u201d for one, Mathews said.\n\nAs care and business models change in an era of health reform, pharmacies and doctors today can better connect and collaborate through electronic medical records and health information exchanges that enable them to readily exchange patient information, Wagenknecht said. Pharmacies now can easily transmit the results of a customer\u2019s blood pressure or cholesterol tests, or results from a simple diagnostic test, straight to his or her physician.\n\nHow well the emerging role may help to improve the health of customers is unknown, although an initiative several years ago in Asheville, N.C. shows potential.\n\nKnown as the Asheville Project, the initiative included having pharmacists develop in-store care services.\n\nIn just one example of success, a 2008 article in the Journal of the American Pharmacists Association detailed how the effort used pharmacists to consult with and monitor patients with hypertension. The initiative \u201cachieved significant clinical improvements that were sustained for as long as six years, a significant increase in the use of (cardiovascular) medications, and a decrease in (cardiovascular) events and related medical costs.\u201d\n\nKey to the evolving role for pharmacies, however, is receiving payment for services. Customers typically pay out of their pockets for consulting and some health insurers will reimburse for flu shots and simple diagnostic tests.\n\nThe Asheville Project involved insurers reimbursing pharmacists for their services.\n\nAt Keystone Pharmacy, Miller would like to expand into other areas for consulting services \u2014 hypertension, diabetes and weight management, for instance \u2014 although he\u2019s hesitant to go too far for now.\n\n\u201cIt has to make business sense,\u201d Miller said, and that means securing reimbursement payments from health insurers for the service or care provided.\n\n\u201cUntil there\u2019s a successful reimbursement model, I\u2019m not interested in rolling out those programs,\u201d Miller said. \u201cIt creates a huge drain on resources.\u201d\n\nWhile the expanding role of pharmacists stems in part from the business opportunity in today\u2019s health care era, Miller initially started offering consulting services a decade ago out of economic necessity, starting with women\u2019s health and then adding pain management. As reimbursement payments for prescriptions started tightening, he needed to diversify his revenue stream and decided to do it by offering fee-based consulting services.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s becoming harder and harder for a pharmacy to stay open filling prescriptions. In a few years, it may be impossible,\u201d Miller said. \u201cWe need alternative revenue streams. Without different revenue streams, traditional pharmacies are going to die.\u201d\n\n--\n\nEditor\u2019s note: An earlier version of this story incorrectlty stated that Keystone Pharmacy charges for its nutritional consulting division.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Already much more than just a place to fill prescriptions, the pharmacy could become an accessible, one-stop center in the delivery of basic health ca...", "generator": "runengine.com", "rights": "www.MiBiz.com", "og": {"url": "https://mibiz.com/item/21134-pharmacies-embrace-broader-role-in-shifting-health-care-industry", "image": "http://mibiz.com/media/k2/items/cache/ec7cff5a47e992e1e98c3199f571dd35_XL.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Already much more than just a place to fill prescriptions, the pharmacy could become an accessible, one-stop center in the delivery of basic health ca...", "title": "Pharmacies embrace broader role in shifting health care industry"}, "image": "https://mibiz.com/media/k2/items/cache/ec7cff5a47e992e1e98c3199f571dd35_S.jpg", "title": "Pharmacies embrace broader role in shifting health care industry", "author": "Mark Sanchez", "keywords": "mibiz, mi biz, business news articles, michigan business news, western michigan news, west michigan news, grand rapids news, muskegon news, kalamazoo news, battle creek news, holland news, michigan business search, michigan small business, michigan manufacturers,economic development michigan", "original-source": "https://mibiz.com/item/21134-pharmacies-embrace-broader-role-in-shifting-health-care-industry"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9c73\"", "article_summary": "[RELATED: \"In era of health reform, retail clinics become part of health care delivery system,\" from Crain's Detroit Business.]\nAs the pharmacy\u2019s role in the health care system continues expanding, Mathews sees more of them opening in-store medical clinics.\nAlready much more than just a place to fill prescriptions, the pharmacy could become an accessible, one-stop center in the delivery of basic health care services.\nAs reimbursement payments for prescriptions started tightening, he needed to diversify his revenue stream and decided to do it by offering fee-based consulting services.\nKnown as the Asheville Project, the initiative included having pharmacists develop in-store care services."}
