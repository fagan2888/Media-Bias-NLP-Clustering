A government shutdown and the disastrous rollout of Healthcare.gov. Since then we\u2019ve had intelligence failures regarding ISIS; we\u2019ve had the debacle of the veterans handling of healthcare; and the Secret Service that couldn\u2019t lock the front door of the White House. So people think this is a gang that can\u2019t shoot straight.\u201d\n\nUniversity of Tennessee law professor Glenn Reynolds repackaged Will\u2019s basic argument in USA Today on Monday. Among those he cited was \"Meet the Press\" host Chuck Todd, who added lost IRS emails, Edward Snowden's NSA disclosures, and the child-migrant crisis to the litany. Members of the media are enabling this opportunism. They should be anathematizing it.\n\nThe competence argument is appealing because it doesn\u2019t require dabbling in pseudoscience or xenophobia\u2014just healthy skepticism of our governing institutions. Moreover, I\u2019m certain this sort of skepticism does help explain why a large minority of people in the U.S. feels at risk of contracting Ebola. But they are at no great risk. That the risk is provably infinitesimal underscores the fact that the issue with Ebola isn\u2019t the virus itself so much as paranoia about it.\n\nEven if each of the failures and crises enumerated above were as unambiguous and damning as the administration's critics claim, it doesn\u2019t follow that federal health officials aren\u2019t up to the task of controlling Ebola, or that the public at large faces any meaningful risk. It might follow that we shouldn\u2019t believe this season\u2019s Affordable Care Act enrollment period will be glitch-free, and that the Vetrerans Affairs\u2019s problems won\u2019t be solved with new management alone. The point is not that we should never draw inferences from this administration's previous failings. But it\u2019s a fallacy to arbitrarily extend that second-guessing to the Ebola containment effort, while at the same time happily taking it for granted that the vast majority of things we entrust the government to do will continue apace.\n\nEbola carries a crucial mix of novelty, visibility, and lethality that ripens it for demagogy. But conservatives have selected a familiar line of demagogy\u2014that you can't trust the government to administer things and solve problems\u2014and imposed it on to a situation where stoking reflexive distrust of the government tugs at the lid of a big Pandora's box.\n\nThe sad irony is that state and local institutions, so beloved on the right, were apparently out to sea when Ebola arrived in Dallas, and health officials there would have let things drift further into chaos had the federal government not intruded further. Not that they've performed flawlessly, but we need more of their expertise and involvement, not less. Texas Governor Rick Perry\u2014who in gentler times plays footsie with secession\u2014is grateful for this intrusion, and has \u201cgreat faith\u201d that their efforts will succeed. Perhaps he\u2019ll surprise us further by dismissing the idea that the federal officials who\u2019ve stepped up against Ebola shouldn't be trusted because about a year ago, some federal healthcare website was beset by glitches.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "The first transmission of Ebola within the United States, from Liberian visitor Thomas Eric Duncan to a Dallas nurse,&nbsp;marked a turning point in the political dialogue surrounding the virus toward an unbridled opportunism.
