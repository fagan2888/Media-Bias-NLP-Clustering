We are well-intentioned-pushing ourselves to add value for the people and organizations we serve.\n\nOur companies entrust us with-and identify us by-traditional HR responsibilities: from recruiting and onboarding to benefits enrollment, performance management, compensation administration, training, job evaluation and more. We constantly adjust to events in the business environment such as recession, minimum wage hikes, the war on talent and new regulations such as the Affordable Care Act. Unfortunately, we often respond to these challenges from a siloed perspective that reflects minimal coordination across the HR and business functions.\n\nBest-in-class HR emerges from a thoughtful and comprehensive company-wide response. For example, a best-in-class response to the 30-hour provision of the ACA would include modeling several workforce scenarios, so HR, finance and operations leaders can discuss adjustments to their business, people and reward strategies. Change-management techniques are then used to optimize employee engagement, public relations and other short- and long-term goals.\n\nHow can HR move from good to better to best-in-class? The transition starts with an understanding of the current enterprise. In Orbiting the Giant Hairball, Gordon MacKenzie describes a corporation as just that-a giant hairball, or more specifically, a bureaucracy with an entangled pattern of behavior. Change requires \"orbiting\" the figurative hairball (even for short periods) to push the boundaries of ingrained corporate patterns so you can see what transformational possibilities exist.\n\nOur model for untangling the hairball is to focus on several key principles and objectives, and to use a guiding North Star to follow as we make our way toward a best-in-class HR function.\n\nAligning Strategies across All Functions\n\nFew HR leaders today would deny the premise that employees are assets worthy of future investment and not simply costs to be managed.\n\nTo best manage human capital, however, companies must align and integrate business, people and reward strategies. This requires integrating work across business operations, finance and HR functions-whereby business operations and finance complete annual business plans in partnership with HR, and HR is responsible for talent management, workforce planning and rewards to ensure a successful achievement of business goals.\n\nHR determines if a company has the right people in the right roles to accomplish its plans, and if there are suitable recruitment and talent-management strategies in place to best support future business objectives.\n\nTo that end, HR needs to create a total-rewards strategy-including such things as employee compensation, benefits, learning and development, and perquisites-that fosters and sustains engagement and drives business results.\n\nWhile companies typically evaluate business-capital-investment decisions by comparing incremental revenue generation with incremental operating expenses, we rarely consider human capital investments in this light. More commonly, we view these expenditures as operational costs, and neglect the incremental business revenue they may generate.\n\nWe propose viewing human capital investments-in employee health, wealth and performance-in the same light as other business investments.\n\nHuman Capital Assets and Personal Value\n\nEach employee owns his or her own health, wealth and performance. Both employers and employees make ongoing investments in these assets, and both benefit from the investments (see figure below).\n\nFor employees, their investments yield benefits such as transferable skills, talent, and health and financial assets. The outcomes of employer investment typically include a more engaged workforce, improved productivity and increased shareholder value.\n\nHowever, to achieve a successful exchange of value, both the employee and employer must embrace their respective and mutual accountabilities. For example, employers are accountable for making sure they have the right mix of rewards to meet the needs of all employees. Employees are accountable to give their best effort, support organizational culture and values, and optimize customer success and satisfaction. This alignment drives improved outcomes for both the individual and the company.\n\nTo see specifically how health, wealth and performance affect each other, consider their impact from both employee and employer points of view.\n\nEmployee: There's an adage that says \"You can't save enough to pay for poor health in retirement, and it will take you longer to get there.\" When employees invest in their own health early, they can offset healthcare costs during retirement, and may well shorten the time to retirement. Conversely, if employees don't manage their health well and don't wisely use the investments the employer makes in their health, their out-of-pocket healthcare costs are almost certain to escalate, impairing performance now and reducing wealth accumulation now and in the future.\n\nEmployer: Employer investments in employee health have tangible business benefits. Consider the increase to shareholder value if the company could increase the output of the top 15 percent of its high performers by 10 percent. Rather than getting employees to work longer hours (a poor prescription to improve performance), enhancing employee energy, resilience and vitality improves work capacity and quality. Thoughtful investments in workforce health and well-being increase shareholder value. Simpler HR practices, supplier strategies that leverage technologies to reduce time-draining inefficiencies, and other measures to improve the employee experience also could improve work outputs for high performers (indeed, for all workers).\n\nHealth, wealth and performance assets are mutually reinforcing. The sum of each employee's health, wealth and performance attributes represents their respective personal value (PV). When the PV for each employee within an organization is aggregated, the cumulative total represents the human capital of the enterprise.\n\nYou can learn more about these simple definitions of personal value and human capital through the Healthways/Gallup definition of well-being and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development's Better Life Index. Both capture broad measures of personal value and human capital and report at an individual, group, geographic and national level.\n\nA Guiding North Star\n\nNewsletter Sign-Up: Benefits\n\nHR Technology\n\nTalent Management\n\nHR Leadership\n\nInside HR Tech\n\nHRENow\n\nSpecial Offers\n\nEmail Address\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nTo effectively manage the company's human capital, the future best-in-class HR organization must become an enterprise business partner by working across HR, finance and operations.\n\nHow HR earns its role in this new partnership across the enterprise is through excellence in each of the following five domains:\n\nEmployee Engagement: HR needs to be the stewards of the culture and brand, helping employees become great consumers of their personal value.\n\nBusiness Intelligence: It needs to be an enterprise partner who is able to transform data and information into knowledge and action to drive business improvement.\n\nResource Optimization: It must be adept at eliminating waste and determining where to re-invest operational excellence savings. Improve cycle times from more efficient processes can translate into higher productivity. What's more, it needs to re-engineer existing processes, identify new business opportunities and increase efficiencies through the intelligent use of technology.\n\nHuman Capital Management: HR needs to embrace an investment mind-set, one that takes into account workforce well-being, relentless talent management, personalizes reward solutions and models workforce implications as business strategies evolve.\n\nInnovation and Supplier Leadership: It needs to embed innovation as a \"team sport,\" identify new profit-center opportunities and transform vendor relationships into meaningful, mutually beneficial partnerships.\n\nThoughtful consideration of each of the domains of the North Star helps HR think holistically as business partners supporting the enterprise.\n\nMany HR departments have strengths in selected domains on the star. An isolated focus on a single domain may benefit that domain's goals to the detriment of overall business objectives.\n\nFor example, based on current budget pressures, many employers promoted healthcare cost containment as a business priority, and used cost-shifting as a means to maintain a balanced budget. This approach resulted in employee out-of-pocket cost pressures and care avoidance. Although perhaps helpful in the short-term, the lost productivity from both financial stress and unhealthy workers can be substantial, and may well outweigh any healthcare cost savings.\n\nWith a clear North Star, it becomes easier to understand how to think more holistically-and strategically-about how to effectively align HR and enterprise business goals. Employers want a healthy, high-performing workforce to drive business revenues. Employees desire improvements in their personal value and want to perform work that is meaningful. They also want employers to reward them for doing so. A vital part of our work as HR leaders is to continuously assess and align the priorities between the company and employees.\n\nDo you know your guiding North Star? Staying centered with your star will help you untangle your \"hairball,\" ultimately improve operational efficiency and grant more hairball-orbiting time to your HR team. Our employees, business and shareholders need us to be successful-in these times, now more than ever.\n\nChris McSwain is chief strategy officer at Naperville, Ill.-based Aasonn and Dr. Bruce Sherman is the medical director of population health management and health-exchange solutions at Norwalk, Conn.-based Xerox.
