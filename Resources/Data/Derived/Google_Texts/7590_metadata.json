The pressure to reduce the cost of providing care has never been greater, prompting most healthcare organizations to embark on massive cost reduction initiatives.\n\nUnfortunately, the first tactic for many of these cost reduction initiatives continues to be one \u201ctried and true\u201d approach which is often ineffective\u2013 operational benchmarking \u2013 which entails comparing department level efficiency and cost metrics to peer organizations.\n\nThe response of many would be \u2018operational benchmarking is ineffective? No way. Everyone is doing it so it must work.\u2019\n\nTo understand why benchmarking is not necessarily the answer, consider the following:\n\nAll of the fees that you\u2019ve paid to benchmarking organizations\n\nAll of the hours that you\u2019ve spent extracting and sending data\n\nAll of the time that you\u2019ve spent trying to understand why your organization looks comparatively unfavorable\n\nAll of the time spent arguing over the validity of the benchmark\n\nAll of the time spent reaching out to \u201cbetter performing\u201d organizations only to find that they are structured completely differently\n\nAll the data you generated that you never used\n\nThe key here is that very often this is money and time spent NOT taking action and NOT driving cost out.\n\nIn an era of nine digit cost reduction targets, benchmarking costs money, which providers are actually trying to save not spend. The shortcomings of operational benchmarking are critical to understand:\n\nIt consumes people\u2019s time, which is also very limited and costly.\n\nIt diverts the team\u2019s focus to excruciatingly detailed data analysis, when what cost reduction initiatives really require is taking action.\n\nThe entire concept of benchmarking promotes sameness amongst organizations when what we really need in healthcare, now more than ever, are innovations, breakthroughs, and new ways to fix what\u2019s broken.\n\nHowever, there are some examples when benchmarking has the potential to drive meaningful action:\n\nBenchmarking wages, benefits or supply acquisition cost with similar organizations in similar geographic settings. Such comparisons promote action because the ambiguity around the metric is minimal.\n\nBenchmarking outputs of standard processes with universal data definitions, such as Charge Capture rate. Similarly, this type of benchmarking drives organizations to action because the rules of the game are known. To improve the metric, an organization easily, and with little effort or digging, identifies what action to take.\n\nBenchmarking high level performance metrics such as operating margin, and FTEs per Adjusted Occupied Bed. These metrics are not perfect, but they provide a starting point. However, providers should always avoid the pitfall of thinking \u201cWe look good compared to our peers, so there isn\u2019t any opportunity to improve this metric.\u201d That attitude is dangerous because even when looking favorable compared to peers, using the tactics below will most likely yield significant savings.\n\nBut, rather than starting with benchmarking as the source for identifying savings, why not start in a different place that will lead to action quicker, promote innovation and best practice sharing within your organization, and actually address long-standing issues more effectively in both the short and long-term?\n\nConsider the following approach that leans more heavily on internal benchmarking to drive change:\n\nQuantify internal variation \u2013 Compare cost drivers such as length of stay and implant selection among physicians for similar types of cases. There is savings in reducing variation.\n\n\u2013 Compare cost drivers such as length of stay and implant selection among physicians for similar types of cases. There is savings in reducing variation. Dive into operations, ask hard questions, and observe \u2013 Are staff members productive for the whole time they are at work? Are highly paid people doing work that a much lower paid person could easily do? Could manual processes be automated?\n\n\u2013 Are staff members productive for the whole time they are at work? Are highly paid people doing work that a much lower paid person could easily do? Could manual processes be automated? Combine multiple sources of data to tell a compelling story - Often analysts are isolated and/or don\u2019t have the time nor operational insights to produce impactful analyses that will inspire an operational leader to actually take action. The power of data is magnified when it is multi-dimensional and visual, which is not usually part of a benchmarking exercise.\n\n- Often analysts are isolated and/or don\u2019t have the time nor operational insights to produce impactful analyses that will inspire an operational leader to actually take action.

Identify broken processes and actually fix them \u2013 Broken processes are very expensive. Re-thinking the process, roles involved and technology will likely result in significant cost savings.\n\nAn overreliance on external benchmarking prevents many providers across the country from taking much-needed action and realizing financial benefits. For real, sustainable cost savings, organizations must be willing to look deeper\u2014into operations, how care is delivered, and how work is accomplished.\n\nTools that provide real-time actionable data and enable robust analyses with visceral outputs are infinitely more valuable than all of the time and money spent on operational benchmarking.\n\nSince all providers are looking to improve their bottom line, they need to move beyond benchmarking and look inside in order to drive meaningful results\u2014and drive out cost.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/blog/benchmarking-not-cost-reduction-strategy", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/modules/open_graph/hfn-stacked.jpeg", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "Facing threats to net revenue, most healthcare organizations have embarked on massive cost reduction initiatives.
