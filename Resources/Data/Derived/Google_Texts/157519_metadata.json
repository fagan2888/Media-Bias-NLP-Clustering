Of roughly 3,000 dogs in the show, which started Thursday and runs through Monday, about 300 are competing in the barn hunt.\n\n\u201cIt sounds very simple. But until you\u2019ve done it, you can\u2019t know how difficult it is,\u201d said Lori Oakley, a senior barn hunt judge who organized the competition. \u201cYou have to learn to read your dog.\u201d\n\nCompetition is broken into five classes: instinct, novice, open, senior and master. In the lowest class, there are three opaque tubes in plain view, one of which contains a rat. Dogs must identify the correct tube to their handlers, who then tell the judges.\n\nIn the more advanced classes, the dogs must navigate an elaborate course of tunnels and hay bales, sometimes stacked three or four high. Up to five rats may be hidden in the course, plus decoy tubes.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re judging the teamwork and the communication between the handler and the dog,\u201d judge Molly Campbell explained. \u201cWe\u2019re asking the handlers to really up their game. It fosters a deeper relationship.\u201d\n\nOakley said each dog has a different way of signaling that it has found the rats. Her own dog, an 8-year-old terrier named Jack, used to \u201cbark and scream.\u201d Now, he just moves the hay off the tube.\n\n\u201cYou have to get to know your dog and what they\u2019re saying,\u201d said Mary Wilson, who was competing with her dog Duke. \u201cIn agility (trials), you tell the dogs what to do. Here, they tell you what to do.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the barn hunt, there are four major categories of competition at the dog show, hosted by the Colorado and Plum Creek kennel clubs.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s conformation, which is the beauty part; agility, which is the athletic part; and then obedience and rally trials, which are the thinking parts,\u201d said Michele Sjaardema, show chairwoman for the Plum Creek Kennel Club.\n\nAccording to Sjaardema, 184 breeds are participating in the show.\n\n\u201cEvery breed you can imagine is here,\u201d competitor Darryl Debault said. \u201cPlus, some you can\u2019t imagine,\u201d he added, laughing and gesturing to some of the more unique-looking dogs.\n\nAbout 70 vendors are sprinkled throughout the competition areas, selling items from custom collars and pet portraits to grooming products.\n\nLouise Leone, president of the Colorado Kennel Club, said it\u2019s one of the largest dog shows in the nation, behind the Westminster show in New York City. \u201cWe call it the Westminster of the Rockies,\u201d she joked.\n\nDoors will open at 7:30 a.m. Sunday and Monday with events running through mid afternoon.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Dogs put their best paw forward at Rocky Mountain Cluster Dog Show", "title": "Dogs put their best paw forward at Rocky Mountain Cluster Dog Show", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/02/14/dogs-put-their-best-paw-forward-at-rocky-mountain-cluster-dog-show/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150214__CD15DOGSHOW_KO29654p1.jpg", "height": 396}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150214__CD15DOGSHOW_KO29654p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-02-14T15:22:25+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T20:00:32+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The event, called the barn hunt, was the newest addition to the annual Rocky Mountain Cluster Dog Show at the National Western Complex, now in its 20th year.\nOf roughly 3,000 dogs in the show, which started Thursday and runs through Monday, about 300 are competing in the barn hunt.\nBut until you\u2019ve done it, you can\u2019t know how difficult it is,\u201d said Lori Oakley, a senior barn hunt judge who organized the competition.\n\u201cYou have to get to know your dog and what they\u2019re saying,\u201d said Mary Wilson, who was competing with her dog Duke.\nIn the more advanced classes, the dogs must navigate an elaborate course of tunnels and hay bales, sometimes stacked three or four high."}
