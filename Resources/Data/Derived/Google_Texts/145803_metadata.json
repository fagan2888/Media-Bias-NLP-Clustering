It follows a more widely debated bill that would give nurse practitioners for autonomy.\n\nThe optometry bill is SB 622. It would allow optometrists to get trained to do a variety of procedures, such as collecting blood and performing skin tests to diagnose allergies. It would let optometrists perform post surgery laser procedures on glaucoma patients, and administer certain vaccines.\n\nSen. Ed Hernandez (D-West Covina) wrote both the nurse practitioner and the optometrist bills.\n\nHe says his goal is to give all medical professionals as many tools as possible to ensure quality care for Californians. He points to the growing number of people with insurance under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe California Optometric Association supports SB 622; the California Medical Association opposes it - the Medical Association worries the bill would undercut the quality of care.\n\nThis is the second time Hernandez has proposed the optometrist bill. During the last session it passed the Senate and was in the Assembly when he pulled the bill in face of ongoing opposition.\n\nThe current bill includes more training requirements for optometrists who opt to do some of the additional procedures.", "article_metadata": {"author": "Southern California Public Radio", "og": {"site_name": "Southern California Public Radio", "description": "A bill approved by the state Senate and on its way to the Assembly would allow eye doctors to do more procedures and give vaccines.", "title": "Bill headed to Assembly would allow optometrists to do more", "url": "http://www.scpr.org/news/2015/05/25/51914/bill-headed-to-assembly-that-would-allow-optometri/", "image": {"width": 1024, "identifier": "http://a.scpr.org/i/a4c3500cebb7571db7a88be8bb934dcb/26908-full.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 683}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "http://scpr.org", "description": "Member-supported public radio for Southern California.
