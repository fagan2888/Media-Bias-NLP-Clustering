The findings, published in the Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery & Psychiatry, reveal the top risk factors that are responsible for two-thirds of the world\u2019s Alzheimer\u2019s cases. The research team analyzed more than 300 studies that focused on Alzheimer\u2019s disease-specific risk factors and narrowed it down to the nine they believed to be the most common:\n\nObesity Carotid Artery Narrowing Low Education Depression High Blood Pressure Frailty Smoking Habits High Levels of Homocysteine (amino acids) Type 2 Diabetes (in Asian populations only)\n\nResearchers also discovered that the best way to protect the brain was to follow a healthy diet like the Mediterranean diet, which is rich in fatty fish (full of omega-3s), vegetables, and whole grains. What's more is certain vitamins and hormones designed to reduce high blood pressure can help lower the risk of developing Alzheimer\u2019s, too.\n\nThis new medical discovery should shed some light onto the underlying causes of Alzheimer\u2019s, and eventually help researchers determine why these specific risk factors make people more susceptible to disease.\n\nIt was 1906 when Dr. Alois Alzheimer first noticed abnormal clumps of tissue and tangled fibers in the brain of a woman who died of an unusual mental illness. Her symptoms, like Alzheimer\u2019s patients today, included memory loss, language problems, and unpredictable behavior, according to the National Institute on Aging. Since then, doctors haven\u2019t discovered a cure for the irreversible, progressive brain disorder that is known to destroy memory, thinking skills, and the ability to carry out simple tasks. In most people, symptoms first appear in their mid-60s.\n\nAccording to the National Institutes of Health, Alzheimer\u2019s disease is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States, with more than five million Americans currently diagnosed. Unless doctors and researchers figure out how to treat or prevent the disease, the number of cases will continue to grow significantly.\n\nSource: Yu JT, Xu W, and Tan L, et al.
