Many of these gripes involve villagers losing land to officials who are keen to sell it to developers.\n\nThis petitioning has been seen in China since imperial times, when individuals from around the empire headed to the capital hoping the emperor or a fair official would correct abuses in their far-flung village.\n\nIn modern times, local officials have put a wrinkle in the petition tradition: \u201cblack jails,\u201d namely cheap hotels or empty office buildings where thugs hired by local officials detain individuals airing complaints. The lower officials resort to these detentions mainly because they worry their career prospects will be hurt if superiors find out that all-important \u201csocial stability\u201d is not being maintained in their jurisdiction.\n\nMany people who have been held in these jails complain of abuses at the hands of the thugs, such as being deprived of food and water or beaten until they agree to end their petitioning ways.\n\nZhang said the State Council\u2019s regulation on petitions is flawed and the pursuit of stability in society should not come at the expense of petitioners and their rights.\n\nPeking University law professor Zhang Qianfan said that a law on filing grievances with the government should better protect the rights of individuals, but the petition system has only limited ability to solve China\u2019s social ills.\n\n\u201cThe problems lie with the local governments, where there\u2019s no oversight of local officials,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a result, people are forced to seek justice through costly petitions.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven if petitioners are all allowed to come to Beijing, the central government can\u2019t help solve all their problems.\u201d\n\nSee this report at Caixin Online.
