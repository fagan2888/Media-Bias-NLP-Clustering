When Dustin shoots the ball well \u2026 it gives us another weapon and will make us a much better team.\u201d\n\nThomas was recruited out of Texarkana, Texas, as a shooter, having averaged 20 points with 48-percent accuracy on 3-pointers as a high school senior. But Thomas connected on just 6-of-33 from behind the arc as a CU freshman and entered Sunday\u2019s game shooting 34.2 percent from the field this season.\n\nHe looked like a different player against the Trojans. A highlight was bagging back-to-back treys during CU\u2019s 14-0 run late in the first half that all but clinched the game as the Buffs took a 43-27 lead into the break.\n\nColorado (9-5, 2-0 Pac-12) delighted a Coors Events Center crowd of 9,866 with 55.2 percent shooting and the Buffs\u2019 second conference victory without Josh Scott, a preseason all-league post player who, once again, watched from the bench because of back spasms. For most of the season, Boyle has needed to rely on his big three of Scott, Askia Booker and Xavier Johnson.\n\nBooker scored a game-high18 points and Johnson added 17. But it was the shooting of Thomas that drew the biggest smiles.\n\nHis previous scoring high had been 13 points against Jackson State on Nov. 16, 2013.\n\n\u201cIt was a good day for both my team and myself,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cI\u2019ve been in a little slump shooting 3-pointers lately and today I got myself out of that slump.\u201d\n\nCU improved to 6-0 against Southern California (8-6, 0-2) since the Buffs joined the Pac-12 prior. The Trojans are young and were without their best scorer, Jordan McLaughlin (12.7), a flashy freshman point guard who injured a shoulder Friday night in a loss at Utah.\n\nForced to play \u201csmall ball\u201d without Scott, Colorado spread the court, looked to fast break and substituted often. Nine CU players had scored by halftime.\n\nColorado, which defeated UCLA on Friday night, next plays Wednesday at 10th-ranked Utah. Boyle said he hopes Scott is able to play against the Utes.\n\n\u201cTwo good wins without Josh Scott, that\u2019s pretty good,\u201d CU sophomore guard Jaron Hopkins said.\n\nTom Kensler: tkensler@denverpost.com or twitter.com/tomkensler", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado\u2019s Dustin Thomas finds shooting touch in win over Southern California", "title": "Colorado\u2019s Dustin Thomas finds shooting touch in win over Southern California", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/01/04/colorados-dustin-thomas-finds-shooting-touch-in-win-over-southern-california/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150104__CUUSCMBB436p1.jpg", "height": 471}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150104__CUUSCMBB436p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-04T14:08:17+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T05:05:01+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "University of Colorado"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcaf94\"", "article_summary": "\u201cTwo good wins without Josh Scott, that\u2019s pretty good,\u201d CU sophomore guard Jaron Hopkins said.\nAfter watching 6-foot-7 sophomore forward Dustin Thomas score a career-best 17 points Sunday in an 86-65 Pac-12 victory over Southern California, CU coach Tad Boyle hopes he has found that player.\n\u201cDustin hasn\u2019t shot the ball quite as well as he\u2019s capable of until today,\u201d Boyle said.\nBut it was the shooting of Thomas that drew the biggest smiles.\nForced to play \u201csmall ball\u201d without Scott, Colorado spread the court, looked to fast break and substituted often."}
