That would create a strong incentive to hire veterans \u2014 companies with more than 50 full-time workers have to offer health insurance to their employees, and not counting veterans makes it easier to stay under that threshold.\n\nThe Hire More Heroes Act, from Rep. Rodney Davis (R-Ill.) had strong support in the House, and it passed in a 406-1 vote.\n\nBut instead of simply taking up the House bill and passing it, Senate Democrats decided to use the Hire More Heroes Act as a vehicle to pass an extension of dozens of tax breaks for families and businesses (the same tactic used to pass the original Obamacare legislation).\n\nAnd then Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) tried a maneuver that has failed routinely in the last few weeks, and was destined to fail again: Reid once again told Republicans that he opposed consideration of any amendments to the bill.\n\nRepublicans have pointed out for months now that Reid routinely tries to pass bills without allowing any input from senators in the form of amendments, and on Thursday, Republicans said Reid was preventing all senators from representing their constituents.\n\n\u201cThis body exists to ensure that the citizens of this country have a say in what our government does,\u201d Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky) said. \u201cThe Senate is supposed to be the citadel of our democracy, the place where we guarantee that no one in the country is cut out of the legislative process.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is a gag order on the American people we represent,\u201d he said of Reid\u2019s maneuver.\n\nMcConnell even offered a plan allowing senators to vote on an equal number of Republican and Democratic amendments, but that was rejected by Reid. After that, Republicans saw little choice but to vote against advancing the combined bill until they were given the right to offer amendments.\n\nRep. Rodney Davis (R-Ill.) is the House sponsor of the Hire More Heroes Act, and he was initially thrilled that the Senate was considering his bill this week.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m humbled by the support that we\u2019ve seen for this legislation\u2026 and hope the Senate moves quickly on final passage to get this commonsense bill to the president\u2019s desk,\u201d he said Tuesday.\n\nBut when Reid\u2019s tactic crashed and burned, a spokesman for Davis called on the Senate to take up his bill on its own, with no strings attached.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re disappointed and would hope the Senate will act on the stand-alone bipartisan bill which passed with more than 400 votes in the House in March,\u201d said Andrew Flach, a spokesman for Davis.\n\nThe Senate left Washington Thursday with no firm plans on whether or when to consider the Hire More Heroes Act. But given the overwhelming support for the bill, the Senate could act as early as next week to pass it.\n\nThe House passed the bill just as reports were being released saying that veterans continue to face higher unemployment levels than other workers. In 2013, their unemployment rate was 9 percent, higher than the roughly 7 percent rate for non-military job seekers.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "gplus-count": 2, "twitter": {"description": "The Senate missed an opportunity this week to create new incentives for companies to hire veterans, after Senate Democrats decided to link a veterans job bill to broader tax legislation.
