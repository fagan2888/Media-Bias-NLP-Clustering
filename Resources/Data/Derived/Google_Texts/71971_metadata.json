Cameras allow us to monitor the buses and we can turn (the buses) off remotely and respond promptly if they stray off path or anything unusual happens.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a person on duty at the employee parking lot during business hours, and security cameras allow us to monitor the lots from our operations center 24 hours a day. We don\u2019t generally get any reports of crime there.\u201d\n\nAirport officials previously said one issue in play is the length of time it would take for all employees to be screened as they board the shuttle bus, but now they will determine whether that can be handled more effectively.\n\nAn American Airlines employee said the most congested time is during shift changes for TSA employees who ride the buses.\n\nJohn Tiliacos, Tampa International vice president of operations and customer service, said: \u201cWe monitor the buses as they make their way from nonsecure to secure areas.\n\n\u201cAfter the employees get on the bus, the driver has to access a sterile area by swiping a badge to proceed through a gate\u201d to cross the runway, he said.\n\nOnce off the bus, employees who work in secure areas face various identification checks before they gain access to their workstations.\n\n****\n\nThe parking-lot security issues were brought to light primarily by Southwest employees reacting to the aviation authority\u2019s increase of monthly employee parking fees in October from $12 to $18. Another increase is scheduled on Oct. 1, to $25.\n\n\u201cWe were very sensitive to the impact increasing the parking rates would have on tenant employees,\u201d Zink said. \u201cEven with the increase to $25 a month, our parking rates for airline employees remain lower than those in Orlando and Miami and other similar-sized airports in the country.\u201d\n\nBut Southwest employees at Tampa International last autumn posted a petition in their work area that said \u201cCaution High Fees Ahead,\u201d and nearly 100 employees signed it.\n\nAntoine Williams, a Southwest ramp supervisor who formerly parked in the employee lot but now parks in an airside lot, expressed dissatisfaction with the fee increase from $20 to $27 a month on Oct. 1 and to $35 a month in October 2014 for where he\u2019s parking.\n\n\u201cThere are some cameras for the terminal where I park, but I do agree security at the employee lot is terrible,\u201d Williams said.\n\nWilliams compared the airport\u2019s parking security unfavorably to Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, where employees use the airport\u2019s parking garage, and Newark Liberty International Airport, where employee costs are high but security \u201ctight.\u201d\n\nRoberts, the Delta flight attendant, said security police at Orlando International check identification cards at the employee parking lot, and she frequently sees roving security details.\n\nAn Orlando airport spokeswoman wrote in an email that the lot is secured with perimeter barriers, a requirement by security staff that employees show IDs, and monitoring.\n\nRoberts said: \u201cThe point is, when I am in the Orlando parking lot at night, I feel safe. If I screamed for help, I\u2019m sure I would be heard. I don\u2019t have that feeling when I fly from Tampa.\u201d\n\n****\n\nAngel Rodriguez, a Southwest ramp agent who\u2019s worked at Tampa International for 13 years, said: \u201cAnybody can get on the bus. Once they get past (the runway checkpoint), someone could take over the bus.\u201d\n\nRick Marcus, a Southwest ramp agent at Tampa International, said employees have noticed the airport is spending a lot on construction projects and have the feeling the airport wants to make up for shortfalls.\n\n\u201cWe are paying, but I don\u2019t see any improvements with security,\u201d Marcus said. \u201cAny person can walk in off the street and get on the employees bus with no ID, no questions. The situation is an accident waiting to happen.\u201d\n\ntjackovics@tampatrib.com\n\n(813) 259-7817", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Wed, 25 Dec 2013 23:10:03 -0400", "Description": "Lax security in the employee parking lot and shuttle at Tampa International Airport is a potential danger to the airport, passengers and crew, say dozens of airline employees.", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "Lax security in the employee parking lot and shuttle at Tampa International Airport is a potential danger to the airport, passengers and crew, say dozens of airline employees.", "title": "TIA employees: Parking lot poses security risk", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/news/business/tia-employees-parking-lot-poses-security-risk-20131225/", "image": {"width": 3877, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20131225/ARTICLE/131229618/AR/0/AR-131229618.jpg", "height": 2508}, "updated_time": "2013-12-26T05:29:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "Lax security in the employee parking lot and shuttle at Tampa International Airport is a potential danger to the airport, passengers and crew, say dozens of airline employees.", "title": "TIA employees: Parking lot poses security risk", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20131225/ARTICLE/131229618/AR/0/AR-131229618.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2013-12-25T23:10:03Z-04", "modified_time": "2013-12-26T05:29:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "employee,fees,fence,parking,security,shuttles,Tampa International Airport,tia"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbf9f\"", "article_summary": "Roberts said: \u201cThe point is, when I am in the Orlando parking lot at night, I feel safe.\n\u201cAny person can walk in off the street and get on the employees bus with no ID, no questions.\nPerimeter and airfield security fall under an airport\u2019s jurisdiction and are delineated in each airport\u2019s Airport Security Plan, said Sari Koshetz, spokeswoman for the federal Transportation Security Administration in Miami.\nWilliams compared the airport\u2019s parking security unfavorably to Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, where employees use the airport\u2019s parking garage, and Newark Liberty International Airport, where employee costs are high but security \u201ctight.\u201dRoberts, the Delta flight attendant, said security police at Orlando International check identification cards at the employee parking lot, and she frequently sees roving security details.\nOnce off the bus, employees who work in secure areas face various identification checks before they gain access to their workstations."}
