Denver police set off a chemical gas late Sunday in a house where a wanted suspect had barricaded himself for hours and arrested him.

The man was arrested without incident on “multiple felony warrants,” police said after a standoff that lasted more than three hours.

They targeted the man in a house on the 300 block of Delaware Street in the Baker neighborhood.

Shortly before 9 p.m., police officials sent a Twitter message announcing they would “disperse a chemical agent” in the home and advised neighbors to stay indoors.
