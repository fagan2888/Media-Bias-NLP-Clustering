Body shaming concern trolls, listen up!\n\nWhen Sports Illustrated unveiled its annual swimsuit issue earlier this month, it broke with tradition not only by giving readers three different covers, but three very different beautiful women. There was the traditional beachy blonde, Hailey Clauson. There was the powerhouse Ronda Roussey. And there was Ashley Graham \u2014 who last year became the first plus size model to appear in an ad for the magazine\u2019s swimsuit issue. In announcing the cover models, assistant managing editor MJ Day explained, \u201cThe three covers of Hailey, Ronda and Ashley celebrate the new SI Swimsuit. All three women are beautiful, sexy and strong. Beauty is not cookie cutter. Beauty is not \u2018one size fits all.\u2019 Beauty is all around us.\u201d\n\nNaturally, this concept is upsetting to some people. Nicole Arbour, the YouTuber who really seems to be making a career of mocking people bigger than she is, raged this week in another \u201cDear Fat People\u201d video that \u201cThe truth is if [Graham] worked out a little bit more, she wouldn\u2019t be plus size any more, which means she can\u2019t sell s__t to plus size women who\u2019ve turned her into their hero. So to make money, she\u2019s keeping the weight on.\u201d And she complained that \u201cI want to eat cookies and still be a Sports Illustrated swimsuit model; what\u2019s next, you can be a midget and a Rockette?\u201d Charming.\n\nThen on Thursday, Cheryl Tiegs \u2014 the seventies-era supermodel who starred in some of SI\u2019s most iconic swimsuit images of all time \u2014 spoke out about this year\u2019s models \u2014 and it was not pretty. When asked by E! if she \u201cloves\u201d seeing \u201cfull figured\u201d models out there now, she paused and replied, \u201cActually I don\u2019t like that we\u2019re talking about full figured women, because it\u2019s glamorizing them \u2014 because your waist should be smaller than 35 [inches]. That\u2019s what Dr. Oz said, and I\u2019m sticking to it. No, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s healthy. Her face is beautiful. Beautiful. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s healthy in the long run.\u201d\n\nWell, if Dr. Oz says so it must be legit!\n\n(Graham, who is 5\u2032 9,\u201d has a waist size of 30 inches, which on this planet is not that big. But God forbid we \u201cglamorize\u201d women above a size 2.)\n\nFacing a swift online backlash, Tiegs did not further help the situation by posting on Facebook on Thursday evening that \u201cI would like to clarify my thoughts regarding bodyweight. I don\u2019t think being anorexic, bulimic or overweight are healthy. All of these can be connected to serious health issues. I want everyone to be as healthy as they can be.\u201d It\u2019s funny, because one of those things is not an eating disorder. And as one commenter pointed out, it\u2019s a little ironic getting lectures from a woman who for years was a model for Virginia Slims.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Heads up, former Virginia Slims model \u2014\u00a0citing Dr. Oz is not a great way to boost your credibility on health", "title": "Cheryl Tiegs slams Ashley Graham: Self-appointed \u201chealth\u201d expert clutching her pearls over a plus-size model on the SI Swimsuit cover", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Heads up, former Virginia Slims model \u2014\u00a0citing Dr. Oz is not a great way to boost your credibility on health", "title": "Cheryl Tiegs slams Ashley Graham: Self-appointed \u201chealth\u201d expert clutching her pearls over a plus-size model on the SI Swimsuit cover", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/02/26/cheryl_tiegs_slams_ashley_graham_self_appointed_health_expert_clutching_her_pearls_over_a_plus_size_model_on_the_si_swimsuit_cover/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/02/tiegs_graham.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Heads up, former Virginia Slims model \u2014\u00a0citing Dr. Oz is not a great way to boost your credibility on health", "title": "Cheryl Tiegs slams Ashley Graham: Self-appointed \u201chealth\u201d expert clutching her pearls over a plus-size model on the SI Swimsuit cover", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/02/tiegs_graham.jpg", "creator": "@embeedub", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Mary Elizabeth Williams", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Ashley Graham, Ashy Bines, Cheryl Tiegs, Hailey Clauson, Nicole Arbour, Ronda Roussey, Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue, Tess Holliday", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "And there was Ashley Graham \u2014 who last year became the first plus size model to appear in an ad for the magazine\u2019s swimsuit issue.\nBut I don\u2019t think it\u2019s healthy in the long run.\u201dWell, if Dr. Oz says so it must be legit!\nNo, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s healthy.\nWhen Sports Illustrated unveiled its annual swimsuit issue earlier this month, it broke with tradition not only by giving readers three different covers, but three very different beautiful women.\nIn announcing the cover models, assistant managing editor MJ Day explained, \u201cThe three covers of Hailey, Ronda and Ashley celebrate the new SI Swimsuit."}
