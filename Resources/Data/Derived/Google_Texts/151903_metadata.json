In Ohio, he tells critics of his Medicaid expansion that St. Peter will want a word with them at the pearly gates. Two months ago, he went on Hugh Hewitt\u2019s program and mused that he\u2019s \u201csometimes \u2026 accused of having too big of a heart,\u201d which is like saying at a job interview that your biggest flaw is that you\u2019re a perfectionist. Here he is yesterday back on Hewitt and crowning himself a \u201cprince of light and hope\u201d in contrast with a prince of darkness, which, coming from anyone else, would be meant as a dig at Trump but coming from Kasich probably refers to all of his opponents. We\u2019re two weeks away from him telling New Hampshirites that their election is a referendum on good and evil, with our hero naturally the embodiment of \u201cgood\u201d and everyone from Trump to Rubio to Bush to Christie as part of some demon horde.\n\nHe certainly seemed sunny and hopeful when he was angrily interrupting everyone at the last five debates.\n\nHH: Now I said after the last debate that you stayed very disciplined and presented a \u201cI got the experience, been there, done that\u201d message. Is that what is working in New Hampshire? JK: Well, I think it\u2019s some things . I think first of all, I have the experience and I\u2019ve had success and I\u2019ve been a reformer all lot my life. You can\u2019t come from the [inaudible] rocks as you know Hugh, and not be a reformer, and I have a message \u2013 look, we have a lot of candidates who [are] like the \u201cPrince of Darkness,\u201d I consider myself the \u201cPrince of Light and Hope\u201d and I don\u2019t spend all my time getting people riled up about how b ad everything is. I acknowledge the challenges, but then I said, come together, the Americans first, we can solve these problems. The people are hungry for that. People don\u2019t want to have to live in the lane of depression. They want to believe that in America it would be fixed and all work, and I think it\u2019s working. Look, I\u2019ve been doing this for a long, long time. People weren\u2019t paying attention and we\u2019re rising right now. I don\u2019t know what tomorrow will bring, but what I\u2019m happy about is that we\u2019re raising the bar, we have a positive message and many people come and say, \u201cYou represent hope.\u201d What can be better than that?\n\nThat\u2019s what they were supposed to be saying to Rubio at this stage of the race in New Hampshire, according to most forecasters. Oh well. As for yesterday\u2019s bombshell, panic-making poll from ARG showing him at 20 percent in the state, I don\u2019t want to freak everyone out but \u2026 there may be more evidence of Kasichmania about to drop.\n\nWBUR poll to be released tomorrow suggests Kasich-mentum in NH may be real. \u2014 Guy Benson (@guypbenson) January 20, 2016\n\nI asked Guy for details and he wouldn\u2019t give me numbers because the poll\u2019s embargoed, but let\u2019s just say that Kasich climbing may not be the only bad news for conservatives out of that poll. Stay tuned.\n\nExit question for anti-Trumpers: There\u2019s now a small but nonzero chance that you may have to choose between Trump and, um, Kasich. Small because that would probably involve Trump beating Cruz handily in Iowa and then Kasich vastly outperforming the rest of the moderates to finish a strong second in New Hampshire, which is unlikely. But if it did happen, the storyline in South Carolina would have those two at center stage. Which way do you go? Suicide is always an option, I guess.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "\u201cWe have a lot of candidates who are like the \u2018prince of darkness.'\u201d", "title": "John Kasich: I\u2019m the prince of light and hope in this race, you know", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2016/01/20/john-kasich-im-the-prince-of-light-and-hope-in-this-race-you-know/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@allahpundit"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-20T20:21:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-20T18:57:02+00:00"}, "keywords": "darkness, Florida, hope, John Kasich, light, New Hampshire, prince, rubio, trump,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "article_summary": "John Kasich: I\u2019m the prince of light and hope in this race, you knowposted at 3:21 pm on January 20, 2016 by AllahpunditWhat is with this guy constantly congratulating himself for his own supposed virtue?\nI think first of all, I have the experience and I\u2019ve had success and I\u2019ve been a reformer all lot my life.\nExit question for anti-Trumpers: There\u2019s now a small but nonzero chance that you may have to choose between Trump and, um, Kasich.\nThat\u2019s what they were supposed to be saying to Rubio at this stage of the race in New Hampshire, according to most forecasters.\nIn Ohio, he tells critics of his Medicaid expansion that St. Peter will want a word with them at the pearly gates."}
