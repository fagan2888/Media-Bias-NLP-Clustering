Officials in the ex-Soviet republic said 14 people were confirmed dead.\n\nTen people were thought to be missing after an intense downpour and high winds on Sunday turned a stream that runs through a section of Tbilisi into a sweeping torrent that destroyed houses, tore up roads and tossed vehicles into heaps of uprooted trees and rubbish.\n\nThe devastated zoo was still trying to determine what had happened to four lions, three tigers and one jaguar whose enclosures were flooded, zoo spokeswoman Khatia Basilashvili said.\n\nShe said a number of other wild cats \u2014 four lions, three tigers and two jaguars \u2014 were killed either in the flood or while on the loose, when some were shot by police.\n\nBut it was unclear how many more animals would be found dead once the waters receded and the cleanup was completed at the zoo, or how many were still wandering the hills around Tbilisi.\n\nThe flooding also killed scores of homeless dogs at a private shelter near the zoo, shelter staff said. Volunteers were working at the shelter on Monday to care for the remaining dogs and repair the kennels. They said about 150 of the approximately 500 dogs at the shelter had been saved.\n\n\"We dragged them out of their cages, but they tried to go back into the cages because those are their homes,\" said Nati Mzhavia, one of those who came to the shelter to help the frightened dogs.\n\nThe heavy rain that began shortly before midnight Saturday caused a landslide that blocked what is normally a pleasant stream in the hilly city, but as the floodwaters grew in strength, the fierce torrent broke through. The homes of about 40 families were destroyed.\n\nUp to 24 people were reported missing late Sunday. By Monday afternoon, all but 10 of them had been found, Georgian authorities said.\n\nThe government declared Monday a day off from work and school while the search for the missing and the cleanup work went ahead in Tbilisi, a city of 1.1 million people. The government has urged residents to avoid going near the zoo.\n\nPrague Zoo, which suffered from the devastating flooding that hit the Czech capital in 2002 and again in 2013, was sending a team to Tbilisi on Monday.\n\n\"When we learned about the situation in Tbilisi Zoo, we started to work out how to help,\" Prague Zoo director Miroslav Bobek said. \"Based on our experience with the floods, we decided to create a team of curators to travel to Georgia's zoo to help take care of the animals.\"\n\nNone of the people who died were killed by the zoo animals that got loose, Tbilisi Zoo Director Zurab Gurielidze said. Three zoo employees were among those who drowned.\n\nOne of the potentially most dangerous animals to escape, a hippopotamus, was tranquilized and returned to the zoo on Sunday.\n\nA young white lion named Shumba, one of the zoo's most beloved attractions, was found shot in the head on zoo territory on Sunday, the zoo director said.\n\nHe demanded an investigation into the shootings of zoo animals.\n\n\"If a predator attacked a person, then it's understandable, but there are cases that need looking into,\" Gurielidze said.\n\n___\n\nSophiko Megrelidze in Tbilisi and Karel Janicek in Prague, Czech Republic, contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Tbilisi flood searchers in nervous lookout for zoo animals - AP News: TBILISI, Georgia (AP) \u2014 Workers and volunteers labored Monday in .05/26/2016 3:16:23AM EST.", "author": "AP News", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "TBILISI, Georgia (AP) \u2014 Workers and volunteers labored Monday in a flood-ravaged area of the", "title": "AP News - Tbilisi flood searchers in nervous lookout for zoo animals", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/politics-elections/2015/06/15/search-on-for-people-zoo-animals-missing-in-georgia-flood-n2012560", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015\\166\\d4fd9525-c6cd-49bb-9a82-295eace173f6.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "TBILISI, Georgia (AP) \u2014 Workers and volunteers labored Monday in a flood-ravaged area of the", "title": "AP News - Tbilisi flood searchers in nervous lookout for zoo animals", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/politics-elections/2015/06/15/search-on-for-people-zoo-animals-missing-in-georgia-flood-n2012560", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/166/d4fd9525-c6cd-49bb-9a82-295eace173f6.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Tbilisi flood searchers in nervous lookout for zoo animals, AP News, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf285\"", "article_summary": "None of the people who died were killed by the zoo animals that got loose, Tbilisi Zoo Director Zurab Gurielidze said.\n\"When we learned about the situation in Tbilisi Zoo, we started to work out how to help,\" Prague Zoo director Miroslav Bobek said.\nHe demanded an investigation into the shootings of zoo animals.\nA young white lion named Shumba, one of the zoo's most beloved attractions, was found shot in the head on zoo territory on Sunday, the zoo director said.\nThe flooding also killed scores of homeless dogs at a private shelter near the zoo, shelter staff said."}
