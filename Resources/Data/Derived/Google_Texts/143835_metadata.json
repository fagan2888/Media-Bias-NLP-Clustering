That bill unanimously passed after two amendments added by Rep. Fred Costello, the Ormond Beach Republican sponsoring the bill.\n\nOne change will shorten advance written notice to terminate an agreement from 60 to 30 days. The other \u201cremoves the statement that by combining a primary care agreement with a catastrophic comprehensive care policy it would satisfy the individual mandate of PPACA [Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act],\u201d Costello told LobbyTools. \u201cThere are no federal regulations, yet so we are not in a position where we can actually state that.\u201d\n\nCostello added that the amended bill has now reverted to its original form.\n\nThe second bill passed by Health & Human Services (HB 1061) will help recruit out-of-state nurses, by allowing Florida to join a multi-state agreement whereby participating states mutually recognize the licenses of nurses. If passed, the Sunshine State joins 25 other states in the Nurse Licensure Compact (NLC).\n\nTo receive or continue a license in Florida, LobbyTools notes that the bill would require nurses to meet minimums set by the NLC, as well as other requirements determined by the Florida Board of Nursing within the Department of Health.\n\nThe Senate companion bill, SB 1316 from Sebring Republican Sen.
