Mike Lukas

EDITOR: On Aug. 12, we’ll be casting our votes for a new sheriff, the top law enforcement officer of the county. This is a pretty big deal.

We’ve had many opportunities to meet and talk to each of the candidates, and we’ll have a few more before Aug. 12.

All seem very competent and informed. All have extensive law enforcement experience. All have been with Portage County a good amount of time. All have various members of the law enforcement community endorsing them.

All are good, dedicated men and have the best interest of Portage County in mind.

That makes for a tough decision. I’m making my choice with a little “insider” perspective. Serving on County Board has given me the opportunity to see firsthand what it takes to work with the team that is local government. I want a sheriff who is able to be approachable. Someone who can connect, not only with the deputies and the community, but the various entities they will be working with in the area.

For me, that person is Mike Lukas. Mike have proven to me that he can work efficiently, respectfully and logically with a diverse cross-section of our community. As a negotiator, he listens to every side and helps people come to a reasonable conclusion without dictating how it must be.

Mike is also firm when the situation calls for it, but never in a condescending way. This is very important when it comes to running a department the size of the sheriff’s office.

Join me, on Aug. 12, in voting for Mike Lukas.

Mike has the experience, the tenure, the support and the dedication it takes to wear that badge. What puts him over the top is the way he is able to work with community members of all ages, all walks of life, treating everyone with respect and fairness.
