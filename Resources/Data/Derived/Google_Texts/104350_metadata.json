Nicknamed Coco, the boy was with his grandfather when they were both shot and their bodies subsequently burned in a car.\n\nIt is not the first time the Pope has spoken out against the Mafia. In March in Rome at a meeting with families of victims, the Pope called directly on Mafia bosses to repent, saying \"hell ... awaits you if you continue on this road.\u201d\n\nSome anti-mafia prosecutors have worried that mobsters may target Pope Francis, who is reforming the Vatican, including its scandal-scarred bank, the Institute for Religious Works.\n\n\"The strong will of Pope Francis, aiming to disrupt the gangrene power centers, puts him at risk. He disturbs the Mafia very much,\" Nicola Gratteri, an anti-mob prosecutor in Calabria, told CNN in November.\n\n(CNN's Daniel Burke contributed to this report.)", "article_metadata": {"description": "By Delia Gallagher, CNN (CNN) -- Using his strongest language to date, Pope Francis told Italian Mafia members Saturday that they are excommunicated from the Catholic Church.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "title": "Pope excommunicates Italian mobsters", "og": {"url": "http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2014/06/21/pope-excommunicates-mafia-members/", "image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/140618112206-pope-health-concerns-00000605-story-top.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "By Delia Gallagher, CNN\r\n\r\n(CNN) -- Using his strongest language to date, Pope Francis told Italian Mafia members Saturday that they are excommunicated from the Catholic Church.", "title": "Pope excommunicates Italian mobsters"}, "msvalidate.01": "DE341CAC7D45B696ED1776216C18054C", "fb": {"admins": 690014395, "app_id": 80401312489}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CNN Belief Blog", "keywords": "catholic church, pope francis, catholic church, mafia, pope francis", "google-site-verification": "mFBa4OnyEDU23vgVJ6rtX_4izud7FIi9JiscfVsWaKk", "original-source": "http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2014/06/21/pope-excommunicates-mafia-members/", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1e56\"", "article_summary": "By Delia Gallagher, CNN(CNN) - Using his strongest language to date, Pope Francis told Italian Mafia members Saturday that they are excommunicated from the Catholic Church.\n\"The strong will of Pope Francis, aiming to disrupt the gangrene power centers, puts him at risk.\nHe disturbs the Mafia very much,\" Nicola Gratteri, an anti-mob prosecutor in Calabria, told CNN in November.\nProsecutor: Pope faces threat from the mafiaEarlier during his visit, Pope Francis met with relatives of a 3-year-old boy, Nicola Campolongo, who was the victim of an alleged Mafia hit in January.\nIt is the first time a Pope has spoken of excommunication for the Mafia."}
