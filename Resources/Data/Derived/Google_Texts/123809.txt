The House’s top investigator said Tuesday he hasn’t decided whether to reissue a subpoena on Jonathan Gruber, the MIT economics professor and Obamacare adviser whose caught-on-tape remarks about the law and “stupidity of the American voter” played into House Republicans’ deepest fears about the overhaul.

Rep. Jason Chaffetz, Utah Republican and chairman of the House oversight committee, said he wants to speak to Mr. Gruber’s attorneys and exhaust the professor’s options to voluntarily turn over documents related to his compensation and role as a so-called “architect” of Obamacare.

Former Oversight Chairman Darrell Issa, California Republican, had subpoenaed the records after an icy congressional hearing last year, during which Mr. Gruber refused to discuss details of his work and how much he was paid.

Mr. Issa was term-limited and turned over the gavel to Mr. Chaffetz in the new Congress, leaving the Utahn to deal with Mr. Gruber.

“We’ve got to address it,” Mr. Chaffetz said in a hallway interview Tuesday. “We can’t just let ‘er go.”

Mr. Gruber became a symbol of Republican complaints about Obamacare last year, after opponents unearthed YouTube clips of him saying blunt and impolitic things about how the Affordable Care Act made it through Congress in 2010.

He suggested the law’s framers shrouded the law’s fiscal impact to game the budget scoring process, and that states that relied on the federal exchange would not enjoy the law’s subsidies.

That second point is important, because the Supreme Court is weighing whether the IRS unlawfully extended tax credits to customers on the federal exchange, because the law reserved subsidies for exchanges “established by the state.”

Mr. Gruber has said he was taken out of context and that he was theorizing about a situation in which the government failed to create a federal exchange.
