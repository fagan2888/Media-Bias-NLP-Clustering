One hundred and six years old when she passed. I want to be just as blessed,\u201d the 71-year-old from St. Petersburg said of her newfound weight loss and exercise routine.\n\n\u201cWow, 106\u2026\u201d asks Lois Huyghue, the Diabetes Prevention Education program coach for Neal and the nine classmates who graduated recently.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Neal said with a smile. \u201cShe didn\u2019t take any medication\u2026She didn\u2019t have nothing. She just died of old age.\u201d\n\nClick here to listen to the story\n\nToday, diabetes affects a quarter of all Americans age 65 and older. And even more seniors are diagnosed with its predecessor, pre-diabetes. Like all her classmates, Neal has pre-diabetes and only signed on to the program because her doctor recommended it.\n\nHuyghue says a lot of seniors who sign up for the YMCA Diabetes Prevention program don't want to change their routine. And they are skeptical with the program's simple approach and friendly accountability.\n\n\u201cWeek one \u2013 no one believes it. What\u2019s the trick? Oh there\u2019s got to be more than just watch our fat grams and do activity. No one is convinced the first couple of weeks,\u201d Huyghue said.\n\nSt. Petersburg senior Ferne Mayak says she\u2019s not normally the type to join groups, much less with a group of strangers. And her friends didn't understand why she wanted to lose weight at her age.\n\n\u201cSomebody said, oh don\u2019t lose too much weight, you\u2019ll get all wrinkly. Well at 83, you know\u2026\u201d she says with a hearty laugh.\n\nWhile she's laughing now, Mayak didn't want to attend the weekly meetings when her physician suggested it could slow her pre-diabetes.\n\nDr. Thomas Robison has referred Mayak and dozens of his St. Petersburg patients to the Y program, as it preaches his common-sense food and fitness philosophy.\n\nHe's emphasizing the program more now that it recently won a grant Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation grant. Tampa Bay and Southwest Florida Ys for the next few months will offer the course for free to seniors diagnosed with pre-diabetes.\n\n\u201cThis is essentially a 'no brainer.' We need to let people know that this is before you get in trouble, you\u2019re not even in trouble yet. So this is something you can do to prevent yourself from getting diabetes,\u201d said Robison, a primary care physician. \u201cAnd diabetes diagnosis \u2013 after that \u2013 your risk for heart disease goes up \u2013 your risk for strokes goes up. Your risk for heart attacks go up.\u201d\n\nResearchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have spent years trying to prevent diabetes. They've found that seniors who drop their body weight by seven percent and exercise 150 minutes a week can reduce diabetes risk by 70 percent.\n\nThe CDC started testing out those goals through a pilot program with the YMCA several years ago. It\u2019s evolved, and was awarded the innovation grant to reach seniors in 17 communities across the country.\n\nThe grant - which lasts through March - pays for a participant's 16 weekly meetings, access to the Y fitness facilities, and a year of monthly maintenance follow-up meetings.\n\nIn Florida, the grants are offered at the Tampa, Clearwater, St. Petersburg and Sky Family YMCAs in the Venice area. (More information about the Diabetes Prevention program can be found by contacting the program coordinator at individual branches.)\n\nRecently, the grant earned an extra boost \u2013 gaining the endorsement of the American Medical Association. It\u2019s promoting the program to doctors in the 17 communities where the grant was awarded.\n\nThe organization estimates that one-third of all Pinellas County residents has pre-diabetes and are at risk of developing the type 2 diabetes. In Southwest Florida, 35 percent of residents have pre-diabetes.\n\nDr. Miguel Fana, president of the Pinellas County Medical Association, has referred between 50 and 100 of his patients to the YMCA program. The internist said it reinforces what his staff regularly suggests, regarding healthier eating and more exercise.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a fabulous idea. It\u2019s free. They are giving the patients education. They are at the facility training them. They are teaching them how to cook you know helping them with exercise,\u201d said Fana, whose four locations specializing in serving the senior population.\n\n\u201cAnd we know that once people get started \u2013 you know it\u2019s getting them to start \u2013 we knew this program had a lot of elements that would make it easy for them,\u201d he said.\n\nJennifer Tucker-Mogensen has been teaching the diabetes prevention classes at the Venice Y for several years. She says participants are more eager when a doctor recommends it.\n\n\u201cIf your physician tells you that this is something he feels is important for you to do, you probably are going to enroll a little quicker just convincing yourself that this would be something good for you,\u201d she said.\n\nShe says the lessons do stick with most of the seniors. It\u2019s because the program isn\u2019t a diet plan.\n\nWe don\u2019t want them doing anything that they are not going to be able to do for the rest of their lives. So we don\u2019t give them diet plans to follow, and we don\u2019t give them an exercise regime that they have to come in and do.,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s totally up to them to make their life whatever they need it to be, to be as healthy as possible. So we really push for that sustainability piece.\u201d\n\nMary Loeffler graduated more than a year ago, but says the eating rules are still second nature. Exercising is harder, the 72-year-old says.\n\n\u201cThat was the most challenging yes, exercise, yes definitely. Because I\u2019m not a physical person anyway,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I have some arthritic conditions, a little back problem. But when I lost the weight, it made a big difference as far as my back pain went. Yeah, makes a big difference.\u201d\n\nPamela Thomas of Sarasota said she\u2019s kept the workouts going by replacing the time she went to class with exercise.\n\n\u201cI figured I already committed that time, so now I do a water workout in the pool at the community we live in,\u201d said Thomas, 71, who finished the class in May. \u201cI figured if we I can make these commitments, It will work.\u201d\n\nRon MacCartney also finished the pre-diabetes class in May. The 84-year-old from Nokomis admits he slips when family comes to visit.\n\n\u201cYou overeat one day, then you cut back the next, and that goes week to week as well,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I've had four or five days of gluttony, so I will spend the next few days losing those pounds and I will.\u201d\n\nThe new way of life has paid off, MacCartney says. His doctor recently told him he's lost more than weight. He's dropped the pre-diabetic label as well.\n\nPat Morena of St. Petersburg turns 70 this month. She\u2019s gained weight the past few years, as she focused on being her husband\u2019s fulltime caregiver. She signed up reluctantly.\n\n\u201cI had a hard time the first two weeks. I don\u2019t think I lost a pound,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I just stuck with it. Because what choice do I have? I don\u2019t want to be a diabetic.\u201d\n\nBut Morena made it through the 16 weeks. And she\u2019s ready to return to a routine that includes eating better and playing in the swimming pool with her grandkids.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like I told them,\u201d she said. \u201cI lost my mojo, and now I have my mojo back.\u201d\n\n--Health News Florida is part of WUSF Public Media.
