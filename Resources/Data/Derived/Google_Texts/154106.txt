In the movie “Back to the Future Part II,” Marty McFly travels in a DeLorean to 2015 to keep his son out of jail.

Now that the date has actually arrived, two policy groups, Americans for Tax Reform and Digital Liberty, are leveraging the movie to bring attention to the Telecommunications Act of 1996. The law, signed by President Bill Clinton 19 years ago today, was crafted before widespread use of the Internet.

With the U.S. Capitol as a backdrop, the DeLorean—fitted with its own flux capacitor—and a lookalike Marty McFly made an appearance in Washington, D.C., Thursday. The Daily Signal was there to find out more about the issue.

“Technological reality caught up with movie magic. Sadly, telecommunications regulation has not kept up with technology,” said Katie McAuliffe, federal affairs manager at Americans for Tax Reform and executive director of Digital Liberty, in an op-ed for The Hill.

Americans for Tax Reform also challenged people to use the hashtag #CommActUpdate on Twitter to help spread the message.
