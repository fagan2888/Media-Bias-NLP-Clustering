Well, O.K., it was actually Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey. But it\u2019s pretty much the same thing.\n\nYou see, Mr. Christie gave a speech in which he tried to position himself as a tough-minded fiscal realist. In fact, however, his supposedly tough-minded policy idea was a classic zombie \u2014 an idea that should have died long ago in the face of evidence that undermines its basic premise, but somehow just keeps shambling along.\n\nBut let us not be too harsh on Mr. Christie. A deep attachment to long-refuted ideas seems to be required of all prominent Republicans. Whoever finally gets the nomination for 2016 will have multiple zombies as his running mates.\n\nStart with Mr. Christie, who thought he was being smart and brave by proposing that we raise the age of eligibility for both Social Security and Medicare to 69. Doesn\u2019t this make sense now that Americans are living longer?\n\nNo, it doesn\u2019t. This whole line of argument should have died in 2007, when the Social Security Administration issued a report showing that almost all the rise in life expectancy has taken place among the affluent. The bottom half of workers, who are precisely the Americans who rely on Social Security most, have seen their life expectancy at age 65 rise only a bit more than a year since the 1970s. Furthermore, while lawyers and politicians may consider working into their late 60s no hardship, things look somewhat different to ordinary workers, many of whom still have to perform manual labor.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnd while raising the retirement age would impose a great deal of hardship, it would save remarkably little money. In fact, a 2013 report from the Congressional Budget Office found that raising the Medicare age would save almost no money at all.\n\nBut Mr. Christie \u2014 like Jeb Bush, who quickly echoed his proposal \u2014 evidently knows none of this. The zombie ideas have eaten his brain.\n\nAnd there are plenty of other zombies out there. Consider, for example, the zombification of the debate over health reform.\n\nBefore the Affordable Care Act went fully into effect, conservatives made a series of dire predictions about what would happen when it did. It would actually reduce the number of Americans with health insurance; it would lead to \u201crate shock,\u201d as premiums soared; it would cost the government far more than projected, and blow up the deficit; it would be a huge job-destroyer.\n\nIn reality, the act has produced a dramatic drop in the number of uninsured adults; premiums have grown much more slowly than in the years before reform; the law\u2019s cost is coming in well below projections; and 2014, the first year of full implementation, also had the best job growth since 1999.\n\nSo how has this changed the discourse? On the right, not at all. As far as I can tell, every prominent Republican talks about Obamacare as if all the predicted disasters have, in fact, come to pass.\n\nFinally, one of the interesting political developments of this election cycle has been the triumphant return of voodoo economics, the \u201csupply-side\u201d claim that tax cuts for the rich stimulate the economy so much that they pay for themselves.\n\nIn the real world, this doctrine has an unblemished record of failure. Despite confident right-wing predictions of doom, neither the Clinton tax increase of 1993 nor the Obama tax increase of 2013 killed the economy (far from it), while the \u201cBush boom\u201d that followed the tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 was unimpressive even before it ended in financial crisis. Kansas, whose governor promised a \u201creal live experiment\u201d that would prove supply-side doctrine right, has failed even to match the growth of neighboring states.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn the world of Republican politics, however, voodoo\u2019s grip has never been stronger. Would-be presidential candidates must audition in front of prominent supply-siders to prove their fealty to failed doctrine. Tax proposals like Marco Rubio\u2019s would create a giant hole in the budget, then claim that this hole would be filled by a miraculous economic upsurge. Supply-side economics, it\u2019s now clear, is the ultimate zombie: no amount of evidence or logic can kill it.\n\nSo why has the Republican Party experienced a zombie apocalypse? One reason, surely, is the fact that most Republican politicians represent states or districts that will never, ever vote for a Democrat, so the only thing they fear is a challenge from the far right. Another is the need to tell Big Money what it wants to hear: a candidate saying anything realistic about Obamacare or tax cuts won\u2019t survive the Sheldon Adelson/Koch brothers primary.\n\nWhatever the reasons, the result is clear. Pundits will try to pretend that we\u2019re having a serious policy debate, but, as far as issues go, 2016 is already set up to be the election of the living dead.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20150424032006, "twitter": {"description": "The Republican presidential hopefuls are resurrecting long-refuted ideas as if they actually worked.", "creator": "PaulKrugman", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/24/opinion/paul-krugman-zombies-of-2016.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003646456"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "title": "Zombies of 2016", "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/12/opinion/krugman-circular/krugman-circular-thumbLarge-v7.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/24/opinion/paul-krugman-zombies-of-2016.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003646456", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/24/opinion/paul-krugman-zombies-of-2016.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion", "hdl_p": "Zombies of 2016", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "April 24, 2015", "edt": "NewYork", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/paulkrugman/index.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/opinion/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "modified": "2015-04-24", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Christie, Christopher J", "published": "2015-04-24", "section-taxonomy-id": "AD8090D7-4137-4D71-84C8-70DA3BD89778"}, "keywords": "Presidential Election of 2016,United States Politics and Government,Republican Party,Medicare,Social Security (US),Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),United States Economy,Christie  Christopher J", "description": "The Republican presidential hopefuls are resurrecting long-refuted ideas as if they actually worked.", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Paul Krugman", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/12/opinion/krugman-circular/krugman-circular-thumbLarge-v7.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Christie, Christopher J", "slug": "24krugman", "byl": "By PAUL KRUGMAN", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "The Republican presidential hopefuls are resurrecting long-refuted ideas as if they actually worked.", "tom": "Op-Ed", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "utime": 20150424142342, "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/12/opinion/krugman-circular/krugman-circular-thumbStandard-v5.jpg", "news_keywords": "Medicare", "CN": "paul-krugman", "CG": "opinion", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "April 24, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "Op-Ed", "org": "Republican Party", "thumbnail_height": 75, "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "CT": "column", "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/24/opinion/paul-krugman-zombies-of-2016.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/12/opinion/krugman-circular/krugman-circular-facebookJumbo-v5.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The Republican presidential hopefuls are resurrecting long-refuted ideas as if they actually worked.", "title": "Zombies of 2016"}, "pdate": 20150424, "des": "United States Economy", "nyt-collection": {"tone": "opinion", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/column/paul-krugman", "tagline": "Macroeconomics, trade, health care, social policy and politics.", "uri": "/column/paul-krugman", "display-name": "Paul Krugman", "identifier": "paul-krugman", "type": "column"}, "articleid": 100000003646456, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Zombies of 2016", "col": "Op-Ed Columnist", "PST": "Op-Ed"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfd34\"", "article_summary": "You see, Mr. Christie gave a speech in which he tried to position himself as a tough-minded fiscal realist.\nBut Mr. Christie \u2014 like Jeb Bush, who quickly echoed his proposal \u2014 evidently knows none of this.\nBut let us not be too harsh on Mr. Christie.\nStart with Mr. Christie, who thought he was being smart and brave by proposing that we raise the age of eligibility for both Social Security and Medicare to 69.\nLast week, a zombie went to New Hampshire and staked its claim to the Republican presidential nomination."}
