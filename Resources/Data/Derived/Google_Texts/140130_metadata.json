Nonprofit hospitals knew the rules were coming, and many of the provisions were included in the 2010 Affordable Care Act, giving them time to phase in the changes.\n\nNonprofit hospitals are granted tax-exempt status under the premise that they will serve the poor within their communities. Hospitals that fail to follow the new rules could lose their tax-exempt status.\n\nEmily McMahon, the deputy assistant secretary for tax policy at the Treasury Department, announced the new requirements in a blog post.\n\n\u201cCharitable hospitals represent more than half of the nation\u2019s hospitals and play a key role in improving the health of the communities they serve,\u201d McMahon wrote. \u201cBut reports that some charitable hospitals have used aggressive debt collection practices, including allowing debt collectors to pursue collections in emergency rooms, have highlighted the need for clear rules to protect patients.\u201d\n\nThe new rules require charitable hospitals to disclose financial assistance policies for low-income patients. They are prohibited from aggressive collection methods, such as garnishing wages or reporting debt to a credit agency, until they\u2019ve made reasonable efforts to determine whether a patient might qualify under the hospital\u2019s charity care program. And the rules prohibit hospitals from charging low-income residents more for necessary care than patients who would have been billed through insurance.\n\nThe rules also require hospitals to assess their communities health needs every three years. And they provide benchmarks on whether they should provide translation services to non-English speakers.\n\nOfficials with Sanford Health, Avera Health and Regional Health say they are already complying with significant portions of the new rules and are reviewing them to determine if the systems need to do more.\n\nThe three systems use federal poverty levels to determine when patients qualify for discounted or free care. Hospital officials say the financial assistance programs offered by their health systems are prominently displayed in writing.\n\nJulie Norton, the senior vice president of finance at Avera McKennan, said Avera\u2019s mission is rooted in a gospel ministry to serve those in need. The Catholic system, she added, supports access to health care for all.\n\n\u201cWe believe that\u2019s a basic right,\u201d she said.\n\nAvera screens patients for potential charity care cases. Patients who are at or below the 400 percent federal poverty level can qualify for charity care, and Avera also uses a point system that evaluates other expenses, including student loans and rents, to determine if patients qualify. The system also has a policy of waiting 120 days before turning an account over to collections.\n\nIn its last fiscal year, Avera provided $22,098,628 in charity care.\n\nAt Sanford, patients can receive a total write-off of their bill if they are at or below 225 percent of the federal poverty level. Patients between 226 percent and 375 percent qualify for partial write-offs, said JoAnn Kunkel, the chief financial officer.\n\nTorrey Sundall, Sanford\u2019s enterprise executive director of patient financial services, said the hospital has a policy of waiting 240 days before turning unpaid accounts to collections.\n\n\u201cWe make every reasonable effort during those 240 days to determine if a patient qualifies\u201d for charity care, he said.\n\nIn 2013, Sanford reported $44,933,239 in charity care.\n\nRegional Health provides complete write-offs for patients at 200 percent of the poverty limit, and partial writes offs for those above that level, said Chief Financial Officer Mark Thompson. Thompson said he believes Regional is in compliance with the new government rules.\n\nBut Regional is also under pressure to re-evaluate the amount of charity care it can provide, he added. Unlike the two health systems in eastern South Dakota, Regional has a larger mix of patients on government programs, and others who are uninsured. It\u2019s why Regional supports expanding Medicaid to the state\u2019s working adult population.\n\nIn its last fiscal year, Regional provided $17.7 million in charity care.\n\n\u201cThe question is whether we can continue to afford that level of charity care,\u201d Thompson said.\n\nPersons in family/household Poverty guideline For families/households with more than 8 persons, add $4,060 for each additional person. 1 $11,670 2 15,730 3 19,790 4 23,850 5 27,910 6 31,970 7 36,030 8 40,090\n\n2014 POVERTY GUIDELINES FOR THE 48 CONTIGUOUS STATES\n\nAND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA\n\nRead or Share this story: http://argusne.ws/1JSHVbi", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "New rules protect patients from debt collectors.", "og": {"site_name": "Argus Leader", "description": "New rules protect patients from debt collectors.", "title": "New rules protect poor patients at nonprofit hospitals", "url": "http://www.argusleader.com/story/news/2015/01/26/new-rules-protect-poor-patients-nonprofit-hospitals/22382305/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/argusleader.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "New rules protect patients from debt collectors.", "title": "New rules protect poor patients at nonprofit hospitals", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8223c4bd3b4bb15a66d404f93386207cec40c6fc/c=66-0-467-401&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/SiouxFalls/2015/01/26/B9316012370Z.1_20150126213220_000_GGE9PORS5.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@argusleader", "site": "@argusleader", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=823665884", "fb": {"app_id": 174484999248444}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "And the rules prohibit hospitals from charging low-income residents more for necessary care than patients who would have been billed through insurance.\n\u201cWe make every reasonable effort during those 240 days to determine if a patient qualifies\u201d for charity care, he said.\n\u201cThe question is whether we can continue to afford that level of charity care,\u201d Thompson said.\nNonprofit hospitals are granted tax-exempt status under the premise that they will serve the poor within their communities.\nHospital officials say the financial assistance programs offered by their health systems are prominently displayed in writing."}
