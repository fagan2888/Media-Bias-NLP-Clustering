Vermont’s largest insurance carrier is trying to recover more than $500,000 in claims for 600 patients who mistakenly received benefits due to a Vermont Health Connect’s technological error.

The state’s online health insurance exchange caused backlogs in updating patient information and communicating those changes to insurers. Because information took a long time to process, Blue Cross Blue Shield ended up paying out claims for customers who did not have active health plans.

Vermont Gov. Peter Shumlin’s administration recently made upgrades to Vermont Health Connect that should let staff make changes to customer accounts automatically. As soon as fall, customers will be able to make those changes themselves.
