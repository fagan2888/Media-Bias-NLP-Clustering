The landscaping company, Holt Landscaping, had informed Smith it no longer wanted to provide landscaping services at the park.\n\n\u201cWe have two options,\u201d explained Smith. \u201cWe can increase hours for part-time personnel considerably, or we can hire a full-time employee.\u201d\n\nSmith said he was concerned an increase in part-time hours could drive the hours of those employees above 30 hours per week. Thus, the town would be required to offer healthcare coverage under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nSmith said he had hoped to include the new employee proposal in the recommended budget for the next fiscal year, beginning July 1. However, the landscaper\u2019s unwillingness to continue the maintenance contract at the park required the town to act more quickly.\n\n\u201cI think the money is there,\u201d remarked Smith, explaining no further allocations would be necessary.\n\nThe town has seen an increase in both sales tax and franchise tax revenues. Additionally, Smith said the town will no longer have to pay $800 a month to Holt Landscaping, and Dobson had collected more than five times its $600 estimated revenue from picnic shelter rentals at the park.\n\nWith a consensus of the board, Smith will go ahead with hiring an individual for the position.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d say if he\u2019s got it (the available funding), then let him use it,\u201d remarked Mayor Ricky Draughn.\n\nThe cost the town will incur with the addition to its ranks will be about $50,000 in salary and benefits, according to Smith. The employee will make a little more than $12 per hour.\n\n\u2022 In an unrelated personnel matter, Police Chief Shawn Myers said his department is operating two officers below normal staffing.\n\nMyers was allocated funding for an additional officer in the current fiscal year. However, after the off-duty traffic death of Officer Dave Wilmoth and another officer\u2019s move to a department in Forsyth County, Myers said his ranks are now thin.\n\n\u201cWe are always looking to hire qualified officers,\u201d said Myers.\n\n\u2022 The board also opted to change the town\u2019s provider for computer and network support. Smith told commissioners he believed SouthData was better equipped to provide the service than the town\u2019s current provider, Surry Telephone.\n\n\u2022 Commissioners heard the funding requests from each of the town\u2019s departments, which ranged from large capital items such as vehicles to smaller concerns such as swings at the park.\n\nSmith also provided an update on the progress made in reaching goals set by the board a year prior, and commissioners outlined their goals for the town throughout the course of the next year.\n\nEditor\u2019s Notes: Budget requests for the 2016-17 fiscal year and the town\u2019s goals both past and present will be reported in future editions of The News.\n\nDobson Town Manager Josh Smith discusses the town\u2019s goals with commissioners at a retreat Wednesday. http://mtairynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/web1_DobsonRetreat1.jpg Dobson Town Manager Josh Smith discusses the town\u2019s goals with commissioners at a retreat Wednesday.
