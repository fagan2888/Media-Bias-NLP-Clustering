Peyton Manning has lost ground in the MVP conversation to Tom Brady and Aaron Rodgers. But not in the Pro Bowl voting. The Broncos quarterback leads all players with 576,445 votes. Rodgers ranks second (498,826) followed by Andrew Luck (468,412) and Brady (461,043).

Von Miller remains first among outside linebackers. Miller, who owns 10 sacks, has 165,045 votes, leaving him well ahead of Justin Houston’s 125,106.

Multiple Broncos rank second at their positions. The group includes left tackle Ryan Clady (122,432), cornerback Aqib Talib (131,715), defensive end DeMarcus Ware (217,401) and tight end Julius Thomas (241,570). Thomas leads the Broncos with 12 touchdown receptions.

Fan voting runs online at NFL.com through Dec. 15. The Pro Bowl players are determined by the consensus votes of fans, players and coaches. Each group’s vote counts one-third toward determining the 88 All-Star players who will be eligible for the Pro Bowl Draft. NFL players and coaches will cast their votes on Dec. 19.

The Pro Bowl players will be announced on Tuesday, Dec. 23 and assigned to teams through a draft, the second year of the process of an “unconferenced” game. The game is set for Jan. 25, 2015, from the University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale, Ariz.
