When Wellington High School students return to class Monday morning, the female students will not be sporting makeup.

It is part of a student-driven effort to help young women -- and men -- to view themselves positively.

Physical education teacher Miranda Bradshaw was tired of hearing students insult their personal appearance. Her solution was to point her students toward the national Operation Beautiful. It has turned into a project that is now sending positive vibes through the entire school.

"Having negative self-talk. Looking in the mirror and saying, 'Oh, I hate the way my hair looks,' or, 'I look awful today,'" Bradshaw recalled often overhearing.

Looking for a way to help end that attitude in the locker rooms of Wellington High School, Bradshaw stumbled across the website for Operation Beautiful, which encourages young women to stop the negative self-talk.

"I said, 'You know what? That'd be something good to bring to Wellington,'" Bradshaw said. "Then I decided to take it a step further and do No-Makeup Mondays."

No-Makeup Mondays have proven to be popular. Students feel they're sending a powerful, positive message.

"Beauty comes more from within the inside than it does on the outside," Tayland French, a Wellington freshman, said. "We're still beautiful without makeup."

French was one of several freshmen Bradshaw told about Operation Beautiful. The ladies took over and their older peers enthusiastically jumped on board.

"I think that they really like that the freshmen are doing it because usually when you come into high school, freshmen are scared and they don't want to go outside of anything or stand out," freshman Erin Goodrum said.

Standing out now in the halls of WHS are sticky notes carrying encouraging messages. The trend is catching on big time.

"You can find them anywhere," freshman Saige Masonhall said. "In classrooms. Some people are even doing it out in the public. The middle school is doing it, too."
