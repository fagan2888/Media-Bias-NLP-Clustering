Fans were told to briefly stay inside the stadium until the police were able to clear an intersection outside of the venue.\n\nMeanwhile, a smaller \"splinter group\" looted a convenience store and threw tables and chairs through storefront windows, shattering the glass. One group smashed the window of a department store inside a downtown mall and, at one point, a protester tossed a flaming metal garbage can toward a line of police officers in riot gear as they tried to push back the crowd.\n\nEarlier, a group of protesters smashed the windows of at least three police cars and got into fights with baseball fans outside a bar.\n\nPolice Commissioner Anthony Batts said roughly 1,200 officers were deployed downtown and across the city to try and keep the peace. At least five officers were injured and 12 people were arrested. Batts said he believes the \"very violent agitators\" are not from Baltimore.\n\nFans fill the aisles in the ballpark after being told not to leave for their own safety during the Baltimore Orioles and the Boston Red Sox baseball game, Saturday, April 25, 2015, in Baltimore.

This is something that's unacceptable to me and everyone who lives in Baltimore,\" she said.\n\nFire officials said roughly 1,200 protesters gathered at City Hall Saturday afternoon to protest Gray's death, which has prompted near-daily demonstrations since his death on April 19. Gray was arrested one week before that when officers chased him through a West Baltimore neighborhood and dragged him into a police van.\n\nPolice acknowledged Friday that Gray, 25, should have received medical attention at the spot where he was arrested \u2014 before he was put inside a police transport van handcuffed and without a seat belt, a violation of the Police Department's policy.\n\nDemonstrators protest in the streets as they march for Freddie Gray to Baltimore's City Hall, Saturday, April 25, 2015.

Officers held him down, handcuffed him and loaded him into the van. While inside, he became irate and leg cuffs were put on him, police have said.\n\nGray asked for medical help several times, beginning before he was placed in the van. After a 30-minute ride that included three stops, paramedics were called.\n\nAuthorities have not explained how or when Gray's spine was injured.\n\nOn Saturday afternoon, protesters gathered at the site of Gray's arrest in the Sandtown neighborhood of West Baltimore before making their way to City Hall.\n\nLeonard Patterson, 56, said he drove from Manassas, Virginia, to be a part of the protest. Patterson said he decided to come after thinking about his college-aged daughter.\n\nA man is kicked as he attempts to get up after being knocked down, following a march to City Hall for Freddie Gray, Saturday, April 25, 2015 in Baltimore.

Police brutality is as old as the 1950s, 1960s. It's still here.\"\n\nWearing a sign around his neck that said \"I am Freddie Gray,\" 33-year-old Dante Acree joined thousands of others outside City Hall. Acree said he came out to the protest because \"it could have been one of my kids.\"\n\n\"It could have been my brother, my father,\" he said. \"I'd want the same support.\"\n\nOne of the protest's organizers, Malik Shabazz, the president of Black Lawyers for Justice, said the crowd exceeded their expectations, adding that protesters' anger is not surprising.\n\n\"This is a problem that has not been solved,\" he said. \"When there's no justice, they tend to want to take matters into their own hands.\"\n\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
