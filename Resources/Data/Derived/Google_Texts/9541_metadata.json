I like Bill de Blasio. I hope he does well in his term of office as mayor of our greatest city. But so far, Bill de Blasio as mayor is no Ed Koch. He\u2019s not even Dave Dinkins.\n\nWhat de Blasio needs is a basic tutoring in how to act mayoral. He hasn\u2019t quite made the transition from public advocate to being mayor, and as a result, his proverbial slip is showing.\n\nHe could start by reading Koch\u2019s book, \u201cMayor.\u201d I did, and it helped me formulate a way of approaching things when I was Mayor of a small upstate city (Oswego). You have to learn to be, first and foremost, a good gardener. You must be on a constant lookout for weeds, and uproot them before they are firmly entrenched.\n\nBeing a good mayor doesn\u2019t mean you are the ideologue in chief. It means that your primary focus needs to be on quality-of-life issues that matter to your constituents. Pothole-patching is important. Tree planting and curb cuts matter. In Staten Island, they want a mayor to show up when a firefighter is imperiled. Gyms in Park Slope can wait.\n\nKoch\u2019s famous saying was, as he greeted constituents, \u201cHow am I doin\u2019?\u201d I dare say de Blasio would be loath to utter that phrase to strangers on the street these days.\n\n\u201cGood government is good politics,\u201d de Blasio recently said. I believe that too. I also believe, as Tip O\u2019Neill famously said, \u201cAll politics is local.\u201d In order to have good government, you need good hands-on management, and 24/7-type vigilance. Trips to Rome and Iowa can wait. Canarsie and Coney Island beckon first. John Sullivan, Mayor of Oswego (1988-91), co-chair of N.Y. Democratic Party (1995-98)\n\nCruelty, thy name is Donald\n\nManhattan: After reading the editorial on Donald Trump\u2019s immigration reform plan (\u201cThis is Trumpistan,\u201d Aug. 18), I got chills of anxiety and dread. Force American-born children out of the country. Change the American Constitution to legally do such a horrible thing. No new immigrants until we take care of the ones already here. My God, what kind of country would we become? I was wondering what type of a President Trump would be. After reading his immigration solution, I sincerely hope that the people of this country make sure that this man comes to the White house like the rest of us \u2014 as a visitor on a guided tour. Ralph V. Robinson\n\n\u2018A wielder of opinion, a force\u2019\n\nClinton, Conn.: It\u2019s amazing how closely Donald Trump is beginning to resemble Lonesome Rhodes in \u201cA Face in the Crowd.\u201d Donald Zukowski\n\nA big target\n\nIselin, N.J.: President Christie: Fat chance. Harry Rose\n\nIt\u2019s time\n\nBrooklyn: Mayor Clueless created a disaster when he turned Times Square into a pedestrian mall. His quixotic, insane closure of the Crossroads of the World created a crossroad without roads. All I can say to Mayor de Blasio is \u201ctear down this mall.\u201d Perry Greenberg\n\nRed, white and boob\n\nCarlstadt, N.J.: These women do not even speak English. Why are they painting the American flag on their boobs? It\u2019s disrespectful to our flag. Geri Sabia\n\nDouble-D standards\n\nJamaica: In regard to the painted naked women in Times Square, I wonder why the ultra-feminists aren\u2019t rushing over there, with clothing and the victimization stamp, to defend these \u201cdesnudas\u201d? I wonder if they would call that young boy who posed with the woman a \u201csex trafficker\u201d? Oh, wait \u2014 these women are profiting without having sex! Is this the new-century double standard that the American woman now enjoys? Torin Reid\n\nWe dare\n\nSayville, L.I.: Re the headline \u201cTit for brains\u201d (Aug. 18): The News crusades against the body painters to protect children, but prints a crude headline about it on the front page that any child walking past a newsstand can read. Great way to insure that potential future generations will not grow up to be newspaper readers. You are cutting your own throats. Dare you print this? Michael Hooker\n\nHoly indecency\n\nManhattan: I see the naked ladies in Times Square often wear timely head gear or use current news props. We\u2019ll see what they will do during the Pope\u2019s visit. Their choice of head gear, at least, is probably obvious. Don Wigal\n\nDon\u2019t be boobs\n\nDumont, N.J.: I find it laughable that the Daily News supposedly objects to the topless women in Times Square, yet splashes the nauseating photos on the front page and inside pages. Lisa Russo\n\nMove along\n\nBronx: How many days do we have to see the trash in Times Square littered on the front page? Julie Reitano\n\nRead it for the articles\n\nForest Hills: I am disappointed in the choices you make in terms of what to print. I am a professional and a mother and I might as well have a subscription to Hustler or Playboy. There are so many more important issues to report that I do not need to approach my front stoop every morning and see bare naked bodies. Not only the cover story \u2014 but page after page of nudity. Maya Geiger\n\nLet them learn\n\nBronx: Kudos to Voicer Ed Greenspan. I am a retired teacher and spent several years as a dean in a junior high school. If you have never been a classroom teacher, you have no idea how profoundly discipline affects the learning experience. Just imagine a surgeon trying to operate and all of his assistants are being disruptive during the operation. Disruptive children do not have the right to prevent the entire class from learning. They may need help, but disruptions can\u2019t happen in the classroom. Gilbert M. Lane\n\nMalthus for President\n\nManhattan: The News consistently advocates for immigration with the mantra, \u201cIt\u2019s good for the economy.\u201d In only two years there are 150,000 more residents in New York City \u2014 150,000! You can see it in the clogged streets, on the packed subways, in class size and the supply-and-demand effect on the astronomical cost of housing. De Blasio\u2019s 8,000 so-called \u201caffordable\u201d housing units coming online are like a bandage on a severed limb. Donald Trump is calling for a moratorium on all immigration. Apparently he is the only candidate who has the nerve to address what has become New York\u2019s and the nation\u2019s most pressing issue: population control. We can no longer shelter the world. We must tend to our own. Carl Rosenstein\n\nThe needle and the damage\n\nManhattan: In response to recent discussion of heroin addiction, someone must again say \u201cblack lives matter.\u201d As a young adult in the \u201960s, I went to many funerals of our young men in the black community. They had died from overdoses of pure heroin brought into our community by another culture. No one outside our community made any effort to stop this killer of people and their dreams. Now heroin has come to the suburbs of Long Island and New Hampshire and the CDC confirms there is an epidemic. Now there are all-out plans for treatment rather than jail. The more things change, the more they stay the same. Helen Marshbern\n\nAnti-anti-anti-semitism\n\nStaten Island: With regard to Voicer Joseph Ceder\u2019s comments about Jimmy Carter and Jewish medical innovations: I doubt most Jews would associate themselves with your thinly veiled poison pen regarding Carter\u2019s cancer treatment options. If you believe only Jews discovered major treatments and cures for cancer, you\u2019re delusional. Ellen Settanni\n\nBias incarnate\n\nFairfield, Conn.: To Voicer William Jackson, who asks why the Daily News tells \u201conly one side of the Israeli-Palestinian story\u201d: Have you visited Israel? Have you lived there? Do you know what it is like having rockets and missiles raining down on you daily? Do you know what it is like to experience terrorism on a daily basis? Israel builds bomb shelters for its citizens. Palestinians build tunnels intended to murder Israelis. Israel has a right to defend itself, just like any other nation. I suggest you read up on the history of the region. Emily Winters\n\nWork harder\n\nBridgeport, Conn.: Linda Stasi evidently did not read all of the lengthy New York Times article about Amazon (\u201cWork up a frenzy,\u201d Aug. 19). The article reveals the lack of understanding and compassion for workers\u2019 hardships that could temporarily affect their work performance. Stasi writes as if employees want to be congratulated for coming to work. In fact, Amazon seems to be regressing to Dickensian times.
