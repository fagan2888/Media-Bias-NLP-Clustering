Girls from across the state gathered at Carver Middle School Sunday afternoon for a dance competition.

The Dancing Divas of Meridian along with several other dance teams from as far as Moss Point took part in a stand competition. The competition pits two teams against each other in an attempt to out dance the other team, with the judges deciding the ultimate winner of the competition. The director of the Dancing Divas says the competition is a way to make a positive impact on the girls.

"It's just something for us to get the girls off the streets and get them to do something productive in Meridian," Director Bianca Rascoe said. "A lot of girls are straying away from school and doing something that they actually like to do. I just wanted to give them something bright and fun to do here.

Rascoe says stand competitions are also a way for girls to get scholarships to colleges.
