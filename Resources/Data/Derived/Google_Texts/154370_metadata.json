As such an important part of a baby\u2019s immune system, mothers should make sure there is nothing contaminating their breast milk, and according to the American Academy of Pediatrics, that includes marijuana. As a medical marijuana cardholder, Oregon mother Crystal Cain says she is not worried about smoking pot while breastfeeding, but her doctors, on the other hand, are concerned.\n\nCain\u2019s daughter, Karrisma, was born this past Wednesday at Oregon Health Science University eight weeks premature and required an incubator to help keep her alive. Cain, who was smoking marijuana throughout her pregnancy after having it prescribed to treat nausea and anxiety, said she had planned to breastfeed her daughter, but her doctors had their doubts about what further damage THC-tainted breast milk could do to her infant\u2019s health.\n\n\u201cShe's going to be OK, they said,\u201d Cain told KOMONews. \u201cThey took her off of all of her breathing machines yesterday and they gave her a trial run and they say she's doing absolutely fine. They're refusing to allow me to breastfeed.\u201d With recreational marijuana legalization in Colorado and Washington, as well as medical marijuana legalization in Oregon, Cain believes circumstances such as her own will become all too frequent.\n\n\u201cThere are several studies that indicate that it doesn't,\u201d Cain said when asked if she thought THC could pass from mother to child via breast milk. \u201cIt can't transfer through your milk ducts. Your body automatically kind of filters it. I'm saying there's not enough information because nobody tests it. It's such a touchy subject that nobody wants to mess with it.\"\n\nDoctors at OHSU are not the only experts to advise against cannabis use while breastfeeding. The American Academy of Pediatrics lists marijuana as one of the drugs that can lead to adverse effects on infants during breastfeeding. One of the most important periods of neurological development for a child occurs in the first couple of months after being born, which is why THC exposure may not be best for the brain. One of the earliest studies on marijuana and breastfeeding back in 1990 associated early THC exposure with impaired motor development at 12 months.\n\n\u201cWe had the mom sign a waiver acknowledging the use of marijuana and the potential risks involved in it,\u201d Dr. Charles Kilo, OHSU\u2019s chief medical officer, told KOMONews. \u201cWe do understand the benefits of mothers' milk. We also don't want to be caught in a situation where a mother continues to use and says that we never gave her information on it, never informed about the risks, and so it's really a way of documenting that the parents acknowledge the risks. And we can't stop her from using it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "marijuana, pot, breastfeeding", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "An Oregon mother doesn't see any problem with breastfeeding her daughter while she continues to smoke marijuana, although doctors think otherwise.", "title": "Breastfeeding Mom Refuses To Stop Smoking Pot, And Her Baby May Pay For It Later", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/breastfeeding-mother-refuses-stop-smoking-marijuana-how-pot-can-harm-your-growing-infant-297558", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/11/marijuana.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "An Oregon mother doesn't see any problem with breastfeeding her daughter while she continues to smoke marijuana, although doctors think otherwise.", "title": "Breastfeeding Mom Refuses To Stop Smoking Pot, And Her Baby May Pay For It Later", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/breastfeeding-mother-refuses-stop-smoking-marijuana-how-pot-can-harm-your-growing-infant-297558", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/11/marijuana.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/11/marijuana.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-08-11T15:05:28-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-11T15:05:27-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "An Oregon mother doesn't see any problem with breastfeeding her daughter while she continues to smoke marijuana, although doctors think otherwise."}, "article_summary": "As a medical marijuana cardholder, Oregon mother Crystal Cain says she is not worried about smoking pot while breastfeeding, but her doctors, on the other hand, are concerned.\nThey're refusing to allow me to breastfeed.\u201d With recreational marijuana legalization in Colorado and Washington, as well as medical marijuana legalization in Oregon, Cain believes circumstances such as her own will become all too frequent.\nParenting experts consider breastfeeding to be the preferred method for feeding a newborn, since breast milk is packed with nutrients and disease-fighting ingredients that keep infants healthy.\nOne of the earliest studies on marijuana and breastfeeding back in 1990 associated early THC exposure with impaired motor development at 12 months.\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics lists marijuana as one of the drugs that can lead to adverse effects on infants during breastfeeding."}
