It depends on what you need. If you try them for routine illnesses, be sure to keep records. (Bigstock)\n\nIn a perfect health-care system, everyone would have his or her own primary-care doctor, whose office is conveniently located and offers night and weekend coverage and same-day appointments if you need one. In reality, though, that\u2019s not the case \u2014 at least not yet. The United States has the largest shortfall of doctors of any developed country, especially when it comes to primary-care doctors. In fact, survey research has shown that about 73 percent of Americans can\u2019t readily access medical care on a night, weekend or holiday without going to the emergency room.\n\nInto this void has come what\u2019s sometimes referred to as the \u201cquick care\u201d movement \u2014 a proliferation of walk-in clinics in retail stores (think CVS, Walgreens, Walmart) as well as free-standing urgent-care centers that have night and weekend hours, treat a range of basic illnesses and injuries, and almost always are covered by insurance. They\u2019re staffed by trained medical personnel \u2014 generally a nurse practitioner for a retail-store clinic and a physician for an urgent-care center, the more medically sophisticated (and less controversial) of the two. They also might offer substantially lower costs and shorter wait times than a trip to an overcrowded emergency room. Even better, the fees for each service are clearly posted.\n\nSounds like a good deal, but in-store clinics aren\u2019t without potential problems. Chief among the criticisms is that they fragment your health care, turning it into a series of piecemeal visits with different providers rather than providing the continuity of care that you get from seeing the same provider over time. Proponents of the clinics argue that they aren\u2019t attempting to replace doctors but to supplement their care at times when the doctor isn\u2019t available \u2014 plus provide an option for people who currently lack a doctor of their own.\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to know about walk-in care and when you should \u2014 and shouldn\u2019t \u2014 use it:\n\nHow walk-ins compare\n\nThe evidence so far suggests that walk-in clinics provide care comparable to what you get at a doctor\u2019s office, at least across the relatively basic range of conditions they treat.\n\nIn a study published in 2009 in the Annals of Internal Medicine, researchers examined the care given for three common illnesses \u2014 urinary-tract infection, a sore throat and an ear infection \u2014 at a group of retail clinics, urgent-care centers, emergency departments and physicians\u2019 offices in Minnesota. They used 14 generally accepted indicators of quality, such as whether antibiotics were given for a child\u2019s ear infection and whether high-risk patients with symptoms of a UTI were asked to give a urine sample, as guidelines advise. They found that the quality scores were similar at retail clinics, urgent-care centers and doctors\u2019 offices \u2014 but lower at emergency departments.\n\n\u201cThe takeaway is that most people who use a walk-in clinic should feel reassured,\u201d says Ateev Mehrotra, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School and a policy analyst at the Rand Corp., who led the study.\n\nThe clinics have fairly robust systems of quality control in place. About 99 percent of the 1,700 retail clinics operating in the United States are members of the Convenient Care Association, an industry group that sets quality guidelines and standards of care. One of those standards is that all clinics use electronic medical records; another is that they fill in the patient\u2019s primary-care doctor, if the customer agrees and if he already has a doctor. (Thirty to 40 percent of customers do not, according to Tine Hansen-Turton, executive director of the CCA.)\n\nUsing a clinic wisely\n\nThe debate over retail clinics is becoming more heated as they begin to segue beyond basic acute illnesses and vaccinations and into the management of chronic conditions such as diabetes, high cholesterol and high blood pressure.\n\nIn 2013, for example, Walgreens announced that about half of its 700 Take Care in-store clinics would start offering preventive health services such as cholesterol screening tests as well as treatment and management of chronic conditions including asthma, diabetes and high blood pressure. That\u2019s where Consumer Reports\u2019 medical experts draw the line.\n\n\u201cComplex or chronic medical problems that require continuity of care do not belong in retail clinics, period,\u201d says Marvin M. Lipman, Consumer Reports\u2019 chief medical adviser since 1967. In those cases, it\u2019s critical to have a consistent primary-care provider or specialist who can help you manage the condition and who will monitor your progress over time.\n\nAnother potential concern is that the clinics\u2019 location in retail stores, where patients can fill their prescriptions and potentially pick up other health items on the way, could create a conflict of interest, possibly biasing the professionals who practice there toward prescribing a drug even if you don\u2019t need one. For that reason, it\u2019s wise to ask the questions in the accompanying \u201cChecklist\u201d box if you visit a clinic and a drug treatment is recommended.\n\nHere are some other basic guidelines from our medical advisers to stay safe and ensure a good experience:\n\n\u25cf Make sure you go to the right facility. Retail clinics are appropriate for routine ailments or services: a flu or shingles shot, a strep test, a camp physical for a child. For something more urgent, such as a broken bone or a cut requiring stitches, go to an urgent-care center. (Make sure the physician on-site is board-certified.) For more-serious or life-threatening problems, dial 911 or get to an ER.\n\n\u25cf Get everything that happened at the clinic in writing. That includes any diagnosis you get, instructions for follow-up care, the name of who treated you and any drugs prescribed or recommended.\n\n\u25cfIf you have a chronic condition such as diabetes or heart disease and can\u2019t easily get in to see your primary-care doctor or regular specialist when you need to, consider looking for another doctor. Thanks to incentives under the Affordable Care Act, more private practices are adopting weekend hours and allowing walk-in or same-day appointments.\n\nCopyright 2014.
