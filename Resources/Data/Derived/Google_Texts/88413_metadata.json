Her brain never formed properly; its two hemispheres are more or less disconnected. Her doctor likens it a broken laptop computer: \u201csomebody goes in there and changes wires and kind of hooks them up different.\u201d Then there is her body, victimized by neuromuscular scoliosis, which causes her spine to curve from side to side. Kaitlyn cannot walk or eat without help. And she cannot talk.\n\nHer mother, Jennifer, wants just three things for Kaitlyn: \u201cthat she learn to say a few words, take a few steps unassisted, and curl the food from her plate onto her spoon.\u201d\n\nThat is from a federal lawsuit filed Friday in Dallas, which stems for years of fighting between Kaitlyn\u2019s parents and their insurance company, TRICARE, the federally funded U.S. Department of Defense health-care provider. Mark Samuels, a pilot, was until recently a Navy captain serving as commanding Officer at Navy Operational Support Center in Fort Worth and remains in the U.S. Navy Reserve. And TRICARE, the family\u2019s insurance provider, refuses to pay for Kaitlyn\u2019s horseback therapy \u2014 the only therapy to which she has ever responded \u2014 insisting \u201chippotherapy is not medically necessary and appropriate for treatment of the Beneficiary\u2019s medical condition.\u201d\n\nThe Keller family is suing the Department of Defense, the Defense Health Agency (which oversees TRICARE) and United States Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel.\n\nKaitlyn\u2019s physical therapist first tried horseback therapy in 2006, and, initially, TRICARE covered the cost. But in 2010 the insurance company told Mark and Jennifer that Kaitlyn\u2019s claims from April 23, 2009, through March 31, 2010, were being denied \u201cbecause the service was not a covered benefit under TMA policy,\u201d as the suit recaps. \u201cTMA\u2019s position was that Kaitlyn was not receiving physical therapy, but was instead receiving an unproven treatment known as hippotherapy.\u201d TRICARE demanded back its share of the treatment: $1,327.44.\n\nThe lawsuit comes two years after TRICARE\u2019s own administrative law judge sided with the family following a lengthy hearing in a downtown Dallas courtroom in February 2012 and ordered the insurance provider to pay for her treatment. (A transcript of that hearing can be found below, along with the judge\u2019s ruling.) TRICARE brushed aside the judge\u2019s ruling and again refused to pay for Kaitlyn\u2019s treatment. North Texas\u2019 Mike Burgess, the Republican doctor-turned-congressman, also tried to intervene on the families behalf, introducing in April 2013 the Rehabilitative Therapy Parity for Military Beneficiaries Act, known to most as \u201cKaitlyn\u2019s Law,\u201d which says the Pentagon doesn\u2019t get to decide which therapy is appropriate for patients. In May of last year it was referred to the House Subcommittee on Military Personnel, then made it no further.\n\nThe family\u2019s story has garnered considerable national attention in recent years. The Atlantic has called her tale \u201can infuriating one\u201d that \u201cblends together the senselessness of our military bureaucracy with the powerlessness of individual veterans and their families.\u201d Time said the Samuels family\u2019s long struggle is \u201cthe best example of TRICARE and DoD failing to see the forest for the trees.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit calls TRICARE\u2019s actions \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d and \u201can abuse of discretion.\u201d\n\nIts decision, says the complaint, \u201cis devoid of reason and is unsupported by substantial evidence. TMA provides no legal or factual basis for its decision that physical therapy that utilizes a horse instead of a therapy ball, barrel, wedge or other tool is anything but physical therapy. [TRICARE] cites no source for its decision to deny care based on the tool selected because nothing in [TRICARE]\u2019s regulation permits the government to deny care based on which tool a doctor or physical therapist chooses. In its denial letter, [TRICARE] insists that Kaitlyn is not using the horse for physical therapy, despite the evidence furnished at the prior hearing and the [administrative law judge's] finding to the contrary.\u201d\n\nThe family wants the court to order TRICARE \u201cto pay its share of the costs, past, present, and future, of all physician-prescribed physical therapy that Kaitlyn has received,\u201d and to \u201cpermanently enjoin and restrain [TRICARE] from denying Kaitlyn and her parents benefits for her physician-prescribed physical therapy.\u201d\n\nThe suit is below.\n\nKaitlyn Samuels v Department of Defense", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RoZXNjb29wYmxvZy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDE0LzA4L3NpbmNlLXBlbnRhZ29uLXdvbnQtcGF5LWZvci1kaXNhYmxlZC1naXJscy10aGVyYXB5LWhlci1mYXRoZXItYS1uYXZ5LWNhcHRhaW4taXMtZm9yY2VkLXRvLWZlZGVyYWwtY291cnRob3VzZS5odG1sLw==", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Robert Wilonsky", "og": {"site_name": "The Scoop Blog", "description": "Kaitlyn Samuels has been at war with her body since her birth 17 years ago.
