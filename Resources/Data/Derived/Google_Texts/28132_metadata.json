But the Wisconsin native, who did not want to publish her real name, said she was moved to speak out when she learned that a bill backed by Gov. Scott Walker (R) to ban nearly all abortions after 20 weeks was advancing quickly towards passage.\n\nCarly told ThinkProgress that she and her husband had been trying to get pregnant for 10 months, but the same day they learned they were expecting a son, they learned he would have a serious, possibly fatal heart defect.\n\n\u201cI was at 21 weeks and two days when we got the test results back, and it wasn\u2019t good news,\u201d Carly told ThinkProgress. \u201cI was so vulnerable and just devastated. This was a baby that we desperately wanted. But we talked about it and decided that we could deal with the hospitals and all the surgeries, but could our son? Should he have to live every single day of his life in pain? I don\u2019t think he should. What kind of a life is that?\u201d\n\nCarly said the decision also hinged on the wellbeing of her husband\u2019s teenage daughter, who has several disabilities. \u201cWe also had to think about what is best for her,\u201d she said. \u201cShe needs a lot of our attention, and she doesn\u2019t need to watch her little brother suffer.\u201d\n\nWisconsin already has many restrictions that make it difficult to get an abortion. Currently, there are only four clinics that offer abortions \u2014 meaning 95 percent of Wisconsin counties does not have one \u2014 in a state with more than a million women of reproductive age. The number of family planning clinics has been dwindling, too. Five more clinics were operating in rural areas before Gov. Scott Walker slashed funding for Planned Parenthood in his 2011 budget.\n\nThose who can access an abortion clinic can\u2019t use their insurance to help pay for the procedure if they\u2019re covered on Medicaid or a subsidized federal plan under the Affordable Care Act. Additionally, they must go through a mandatory counseling session and ultrasound, then wait 24 hours before having the abortion itself \u2014 ostensibly to think harder about the decision to terminate the pregnancy.\n\nCarly told ThinkProgress she found this waiting period burdensome and insulting. \u201cAs if I hadn\u2019t already been thinking about it every single day, 24 hours a day, for weeks, leading up to it,\u201d she said.\n\nAfraid she would have to wait several more weeks to schedule the two appointments in her own state necessary to complete the counseling requirement, Carly took nearly a week off of her job in a dental lab to travel to Chicago for the procedure. She told ThinkProgress that, even though it \u201cwould have been so much more comforting to be at home during such an awful time,\u201d she was instead forced to navigate Chicago traffic and pay for a hotel room.\n\nNot all women in Carly\u2019s situation are able to take off work and afford the travel costs necessary to seek an out-of-state abortion. And soon, those women may have even fewer options. On Tuesday, Wisconsin\u2019s Senate Committee on Health and Human Services took up a bill that would ban all abortions after 20 weeks, with a vague carve-out for \u201cmedical emergencies\u201d but no exemptions for cases of rape or incest. Governor Walker has already promised to sign the bill if it passes the legislature, despite the fact that similar laws have been struck down by courts in other states and some medical experts believe these policies lead to more, not fewer, abortions.\n\nTuesday\u2019s hearing on the bill presented a microcosm of the deeply divided state, with heated rhetoric on all sides and personal attacks leveled against both the legislators and the medical experts who testified.\n\nDefending her proposal, Sen. Mary Lazich (R-New Berlin) told her colleagues that \u201cexcruciating pain from dismembering a child should not be allowed.\u201d When pressed on why the bill has no exemptions for rape and incest, Lazich shot back: \u201cWe don\u2019t differentiate between some classes of children and other classes of children.\u201d\n\nMany lawmakers, including Rep. Lisa Subeck (D-Madison), raised concerns about the bill\u2019s vague medical emergency exemption, which rests on doctors using their \u201cbest medical judgment\u201d to decide whether they\u2019re permitted to provide abortion care in a situation when their patient\u2019s health is at risk.\n\n\u201cHow exactly are you defining a medical emergency?\u201d challenged Subeck. \u201cDo you understand that some women do experience health complications during pregnancy that may not put their life at risk immediately but do in the long term? Would a blot clot be a medical emergency? Would preeclampsia? I\u2019m looking for answers about real situations.\u201d\n\nShe did not get solid answers, and Lazich admitted she consulted with lawyers but not medical professionals when crafting the bill.\n\nDoctors would face imprisonment for the felony of violating the law, and could be taken to civil court if someone feels they have exercised \u201cunreasonable medical judgement.\u201d\n\nSeveral medical professionals who came to the hearing to speak out against the bill blasted this provision, including Dr. Tosha Wetterneck with the Wisconsin Medical Society. Wetterneck said the proposed legislation \u201ccriminalizes a necessary and legal medical procedure, which is abhorrent.\u201d\n\nWetterneck also told lawmakers that had she been consulted, she would have advised against a cutoff at 20 weeks, because it\u2019s only then that serious medical problems like the one Carly discovered become clear.\n\n\u201cIf ultrasounds are done earlier than 20 weeks, it\u2019s not possible to see all the anatomy. That\u2019s why we wait, to fully understand what is happening with the abnormalities,\u201d she explained. \u201cWe should give doctors the chance to collect all of that information in order to make the best decision.\u201d\n\nThe committee will vote on the bill on Thursday, and, thanks to a Republican majority, it is likely to pass. It will then go to the floor, where it is also likely to pass, and straight to the governor \u2014 who has already expressed his enthusiastic support.\n\nCarley sees the move as a contradiction to the Governor\u2019s rhetoric about getting government out of people\u2019s lives.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just not right for a politician to interfere with something like this. It makes me so angry,\u201d she said. \u201cOur motto here in Wisconsin is supposed to be \u2018Forward,\u2019 but I feel like all we\u2019re doing lately is moving backward. Everyone would agree that it would be wrong to force a woman to have an abortion, but somehow it\u2019s not wrong to force her to carry a baby who is going to be born and not survive? Or even forcing an ultrasound, or all these other things. It\u2019s the forcing that\u2019s wrong.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "\"Our motto here in Wisconsin is supposed to be 'Forward,' but I feel like all we're doing lately is moving backward.\"", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "\"Our motto here in Wisconsin is supposed to be 'Forward,' but I feel like all we're doing lately is moving backward.\"", "title": "Why Doctors Think Wisconsin\u2019s Proposed 20-Week Abortion Ban Is Absurd", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2015/06/03/3665181/wisconsin-hearing-abortion/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Hearing.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"Our motto here in Wisconsin is supposed to be 'Forward,' but I feel like all we're doing lately is moving backward.\"", "creator": "@AliceOllstein", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Hearing-321x214.jpg", "title": "Why Doctors Think Wisconsin\u2019s Proposed 20-Week Abortion Ban Is Absurd", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Hearing.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Hearing.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-03T09:05:51+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/AliceMOllstein"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8160\"", "article_summary": "Health Why Doctors Think Wisconsin\u2019s Proposed 20-Week Abortion Ban Is Absurd CREDIT: Alice OllsteinMADISON, WISCONSIN \u2014 It is painful and scary for Carly to talk openly about her abortion.\n\u201cI was at 21 weeks and two days when we got the test results back, and it wasn\u2019t good news,\u201d Carly told ThinkProgress.\nCarly told ThinkProgress she found this waiting period burdensome and insulting.\nScott Walker (R) to ban nearly all abortions after 20 weeks was advancing quickly towards passage.\nNot all women in Carly\u2019s situation are able to take off work and afford the travel costs necessary to seek an out-of-state abortion."}
