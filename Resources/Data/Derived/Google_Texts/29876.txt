The Rev. Bill McElvaney, the United Methodist minister and former SMU professor known for his public stands on social issues, died Sunday. He was 86.

McElvaney’s death was announced Sunday to members of Northaven United Methodist Church, where he was emeritus pastor.

McElvaney was an outspoken advocate on social issues throughout his life — sometimes, defying the United Methodist Church. He was briefly suspended after officiating a same-sex wedding in March. He protested the Iraq War and construction of the George W. Bush Presidential Center at SMU.

“Bill McElvaney was a tireless prophet and preacher for more than 50 years, and time and time again took bold stands to lift-up those who were often most marginalized in our society,” Northaven pastor Eric Folkerth wrote in an email to the congregation.

McElvaney was married and the father of two.
