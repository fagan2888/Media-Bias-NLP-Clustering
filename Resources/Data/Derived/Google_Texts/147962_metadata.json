Two of Kersey\u2019s clients with Covered California health plans recently were thrown into Medi-Cal \u2014 the state\u2019s health program for low-income residents \u2014 without their consent or prior notice after they reported their pregnancies to the state\u2019s health insurance exchange.\n\nThe two women are among about 1,900 across the state who were automatically transferred from the exchange to Medi-Cal since October, even though they were supposed to have the option to stay with Covered California. The snafu was triggered by a recent policy change in Medi-Cal eligibility.\n\n\u201cOne of the women missed a month of prenatal care,\u201d Kersey said. \u201cShe was told she couldn\u2019t be seen when she went to see her doctor.\u201d\n\nCovered California acknowledged the problem, casting part of the blame on its computer system.\n\nSimilar Problem with Healthcare.gov\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t implement this as well as it should have been implemented,\u201d said Amy Palmer, the agency\u2019s director of communications.\n\nThat computer glitch will be fixed, but not until September, Palmer said.\n\nA similar problem is affecting some pregnant women who purchased their plans through HealthCare.gov, the federal health insurance exchange that serves people in 38 states, said Judith Solomon, vice president for health policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities in Washington, D.C.\n\n\u201cThe computer system was basically immediately transitioning them to Medicaid when they reported their pregnancies to HealthCare.gov,\u201d Solomon said. \u201cThey should have the choice and they\u2019re not getting it.\u201d\n\nPlan cancellations without notice or consent have been a persistent problem for some Covered California enrollees since 2014. In some cases, people are terminated from their plans unexpectedly. In others, they are transferred to Medi-Cal without prior notice. It\u2019s unclear \u2014 even to Covered California \u2014 how widespread the problem is.\n\nThe situation for the pregnant California women can be traced to a recent policy change.\n\nUsually, consumers are placed in either Covered California or Medi-Cal based on their income, with no choice in the matter, even though they can enroll in Medi-Cal via the Covered California website.\n\nBut the rules are different for some pregnant women whose household income falls between 138 percent and 213 percent of the federal poverty level, or roughly $22,100 to $34,100 for a family of two.\n\nBefore last October pregnant women in that income range technically had a choice between Medi-Cal and Covered California, though often they were not informed of the choice, said Lucy Quacinella, a San Francisco attorney and health care advocate for working families.\n\nNow, under an October 2015 policy change, women who are pregnant at the time they apply for health coverage and fall into this income bracket will automatically be placed into Medi-Cal, she said.\n\nWomen in the income range who already have Covered California plans before they become pregnant are now supposed to be given the choice to remain in their subsidized plans \u2014 which have out-of-pocket costs such as co-pays and deductibles \u2014 or move to Medi-Cal, which is free.\n\nThe idea is to allow them to keep their existing Covered California providers if they want, Quacinella said.\n\nBut the Covered California computer system wasn\u2019t programmed to give them the choice, and some pregnant women were moved immediately into Medi-Cal.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t receive notice. They just knew from one day to the next that their Covered California insurance didn\u2019t work anymore,\u201d Quacinella said. \u201cIt\u2019s very stressful, very confusing.\u201d\n\nMay Be Easier to Find a Doctor with Covered California\u2026\n\nAlthough Medi-Cal is free, some women find it\u2019s easier to get a doctor if they have private insurance. And because Covered California and Medi-Cal provider networks don\u2019t always overlap, some of the women could no longer see the doctors with whom they had established relationships, Quacinella said.\n\n\u201cFor some women, continuity of care is critical,\u201d she said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to lose their providers.\u201d\n\n\u2026 But Medi-Cal is Free to Consumers\n\nBut after the initial shock, some women will consider the move to Medi-Cal a \u201cblessing\u201d because it\u2019s cheaper, Quacinella said.\n\n\u201cEven with tax credits and cost-sharing reductions, it\u2019s really hard for some families to afford the Covered California premiums or for pregnant women to afford a hospital\u2019s labor and delivery charge,\u201d she said.\n\nThat was the case for Kersey\u2019s clients, who initially were distressed by the sudden loss of their Covered California plans but later decided to stay in Medi-Cal.\n\n\u201cOne of our clients desperately wanted to get back into Covered California, but ultimately was fine with Medi-Cal, knowing there\u2019s no delivery cost,\u201d Kersey said.\n\nCovered California has trained its customer service reps, insurance agents and other enrollers to explain to pregnant consumers that reporting a pregnancy could trigger a switch to Medi-Cal, Palmer said.\n\nHowever, until the computer fix later this year, some women who report their pregnancy through the Covered California website still will be moved without a choice, she confirmed. These women can get their Covered California plans back, retroactive to the date they reported their pregnancies by calling Covered California\u2019s customer service center at 800-300-1506.\n\n\u201cConsumers should feel confident that their coverage continues,\u201d Palmer said. \u201cNo consumer should be concerned about accessing care while they are pregnant for fear they do not have health coverage. They do.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "1,900 women across the state were automatically transferred from the exchange to Medi-Cal since last October with no notice.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Newly Pregnant?
