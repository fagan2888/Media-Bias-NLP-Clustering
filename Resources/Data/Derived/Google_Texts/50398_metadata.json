Doctors and other medical care providers rely on communication with their peers to get expert advice, ask questions, coordinate patient care, and discuss difficult cases. But medical communication is extremely sensitive and highly regulated, so it happened primarily offline for a long time.\n\nThat is beginning to change now as tech startups like Doximity create secure, HIPAA (Health Insurance Privacy and Accountability Act)-compliant, doctors-only places for them to connect online. Tangney said saves them \u201cprecious\u201d time and reduces the \u201cburden\u201d of paperwork, which is increasingly important now that the Affordable Care Act is kicking in and millions more people have access to medical care.\n\n\u201cWith Obamacare and baby boomers filling patient waiting rooms, maintaining a high standard of care demands ever greater efficiency from our health care professionals,\u201d Tangney said. \u201cDoctors need a secure way to connect and collaborate.\u201d\n\nMore than 10,000 physician-to-physician messages are now sent daily through the site. Fifty-plus third-party sites use Doximity\u2019s login API, and 200 paying clients are using TalentFinder, which facilitated 70,000 consulting and career offers to physicians.\n\nTangney said most of the platform\u2019s growth has been grassroots \u2014 doctors telling doctors .\n\nPrior to founding Doximity, Tangney was the founder of Epocrates, a San Francisco Bay area company that develops mobile health applications. Doximity is based in San Mateo, Calif., and has raised just shy of $30 million from Emergence Capital Partners, Morgenthaler Ventures, and InterWest Ventures.\n\nMore information:\n\nDoximity Doximity is an online professional network for U.S. physicians.
