Drunk driving is reckless and preventable,\u201d said Gary Poedubicky, Acting Director of the Division of Highway Traffic Safety.\n\n\u201cDuring this campaign police agencies in New Jersey will be sending a clear message. If drivers are caught driving impaired they will be arrested,\u201d he said.\n\nIn 2013, alcohol-impaired fatalities accounted for 22 percent of New Jersey\u2019s motor vehicle fatalities. As part of the initiative, the Division of Highway Traffic Safety provides grants to local law enforcement agencies throughout the state to run the two-week campaign.\n\nLaw enforcement agencies participating in the Drive Sober or Get Pulled Over 2014 crackdown offer the following advice:\n\n\u2022 If you plan to drink, designate a driver, someone who will not drink alcohol, before going out.\n\n\u2022 Take mass transit, a taxi or ask a sober friend to drive you home.\n\n\u2022 Spend the night where the activity is held.\n\n\u2022 Report impaired drivers to law enforcement. In New Jersey, drivers may dial #77 to report a drunk or aggressive driver.\n\n\u2022 Always buckle up, every ride, regardless of your seating position in the vehicle. It\u2019s your best defense against an impaired driver.\n\n\u2022 If you\u2019re intoxicated and traveling on foot, the safest way to get home is to take a cab or have a sober friend or family member drive you to your doorstep.\n\nStephanie Loder: 732-456-2159; sloder@app.com\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.app.com/1otbhXS", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Law enforcement officers will crack down on drunk drivers as part of the 2014 Labor Day \u201cDrive Sober or Get Pulled Over\u201d campaign.", "og": {"site_name": "Asbury Park Press", "description": "Law enforcement officers will crack down on drunk drivers as part of the 2014 Labor Day \u201cDrive Sober or Get Pulled Over\u201d campaign.", "title": "Lakehurst police enforce driving sober for Labor Day", "url": "http://www.app.com/story/news/crime/jersey-mayhem/2014/08/12/lakehurst-labor-day-checkpoints/13979911/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/app.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Law enforcement officers will crack down on drunk drivers as part of the 2014 Labor Day \u201cDrive Sober or Get Pulled Over\u201d campaign.", "creator": "@AsburyParkPress", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9856f0f423f3111be114386cf07026f1a631cc8b/c=360-0-1770-1410&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/AsburyPark/2014/08/12/dui.jpg", "title": "Lakehurst police enforce driving sober for Labor Day", "site": "@AsburyParkPress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600068887", "fb": {"app_id": 116172675120111}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": ""}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2c08\"", "article_summary": "Law enforcement officers will crack down on drunk drivers as part of the 2014 Labor Day \u201cDrive Sober or Get Pulled Over\u201d campaign.\n(Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto )Law enforcement officers will crack down on drunk drivers as part of the 2014 Labor Day \u201cDrive Sober or Get Pulled Over\u201dcampaign.\nDrunk driving is reckless and preventable,\u201d said Gary Poedubicky, Acting Director of the Division of Highway Traffic Safety.\nLaunched across the U.S. in 1999, the program works to combat drunk driving during the busy summer travel season, including the Labor Day holiday period, he said.\nAs part of the initiative, the Division of Highway Traffic Safety provides grants to local law enforcement agencies throughout the state to run the two-week campaign."}
