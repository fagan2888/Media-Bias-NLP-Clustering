Some hadn\u2019t been wearing seat belts.\n\nDeunna Fairchild was pronounced dead at 10:53 a.m., the Tarrant County medical examiner said.\n\nOne child was taken to Cook Children\u2019s Medical Center in Fort Worth in serious to critical condition, police said, and one adult was taken to John Peter Smith Hospital in Fort Worth with injuries later called non-life-threatening.\n\nThe four other victims were treated at Medical Center Arlington, where the adults were found to have non-life-threatening injuries and the children\u2019s conditions weren\u2019t known, police said.\n\nThe crash knocked out power to hundreds of customers. The 5100 block of South Collins remained closed for several hours as authorities and Oncor workers figured out what to do with power lines drooping onto the street.\n\nFreeman was in the Arlington city jail late Saturday with bail set at just under $63,000. She was released from jail Sunday, KTVT-TV (Channel 11) reported. In addition to the intoxication manslaughter and assault charges, she faces numerous counts for failure to have a valid driver\u2019s license, car insurance and inspection sticker. She also faces charges for not securing children in the car.\n\nRight after the crash, a woman who works in a nearby building stood with hands clasped in prayer not far from the mangled car. Police eventually escorted her from the scene.\n\nFor members of the Arlington police DWI unit, the crash came at a tragically ironic moment. The unit had just finished taking part in a Mothers Against Drunk Driving walk in downtown Fort Worth, where they encouraged people not to drink and drive.\n\n\u201cOur DWI Unit ROCKS!\u201d the unit cheerfully tweeted from the walk just before 8 a.m.\n\nNot two hours later came word of the grisly crash, police spokesman Christopher Cook said.\n\n\u201cThey heard the police radio \u2014 all the chaotic scenes over the air,\u201d he said.\n\nThe DWI officers, including one who had lost her sister in a drunken-driving crash, immediately went to work to help with the investigation, Cook said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just surreal for them,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s very tragic.\u201d\n\nFor police, the lessons that come from DWI crashes are always the same.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, people have to make good choices,\u201d Cook said. \u201cWatch your speed. Never, ever get behind the wheel if you\u2019ve had alcohol.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RoZXNjb29wYmxvZy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDE1LzExL3RocmVlLWFkdWx0cy1mb3VyLWNoaWxkcmVuLWluanVyZWQtaW4tYXJsaW5ndG9uLWNyYXNoLXRoYXQta25vY2tlZC1vdXQtcG93ZXItdG8taHVuZHJlZHMtb2Ytb25jb3ItY3VzdG9tZXJzLmh0bWwv", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Naheed Rajwani", "og": {"site_name": "The Scoop Blog", "description": "This story has been updated.
