Cruz has been \"frankly a little bit of a maniac,\" Trump said in a taped interview on Fox News. \"You're never gonna be able to get things done that way.\"\n\nTrump dings Scalia for affirmative action comments: \"They were very, very tough to a certain community,\" he said. \"I don't like what he said.\" \"I heard him; I was like, 'let me read it again \u2026 Woah,'\" Trump said. \"I have great African-American friendships,\" Trump said. \"I was very surprised at Scalia's statements, actually.\" The panel following Jake Tapper's interview on CNN's \"State of the Union\" seemed stunned by Trump's remarks. CNN reporter Dana Bash, who will be moderating Tuesday's debate, asked, \"For a Republican, for a conservative, to criticize Scalia is anathema, right?\"\n\nJake Tapper, host of CNN's \"State of the Union\" (Photo courtesy of screen shot)\n\nKerry: U.S. would not elect a climate change skeptic: \"I don't believe you can be elected president of the United States if you don't understand climate change or you're not committed to this kind of [Paris agreement] plan,\" Kerry told ABC's George Stephanopoulos on Saturday morning.\n\nCarson to GOP on a brokered convention: 'I'm out of here': Ben Carson doubled down on his threat to leave the Republican Party if the primary ends in a brokered convention, which would allow party leaders to select a nominee other than the one selected by voters. \"If that is the case, I'm out of here,\" Carson said Sunday on ABC's \"This Week.\"\n\nPhoto courtesy of screen shot\n\nMuslim lawmaker Rep. Carson fires back at Trump's 'dangerous' rhetoric: Democrat Andre Carson, a congressman from Indiana, said Donald Trump's proposed ban on Muslims entering the U.S. sets a dangerous precedent for the United States. Carson said he has met Trump and that the businessman-turned-candidate is a \"smart man.\" This is why his rhetoric \"is that much more dangerous and we have to push back,\" Carson told \"This Week\" host George Stephanopoulos.\n\nKasich: 'Trump is not going to be president': \"Trump is not going to be president, and he's not going to be our nominee,\" Kasich said during an appearance Sunday on CBS' \"Face the Nation.\" \"It's not going to happen.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "Donald Trump appeared on several shows, taking on the new theme of Trump vs. Cruz, at one point calling Ted Cruz a ''maniac.''
