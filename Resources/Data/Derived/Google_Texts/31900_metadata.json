(WNCN) \u2013 Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina and its customers have had a rocky start to 2016 due to the insurance company\u2019s system failure. Now, with rising healthcare costs under President Barack Obama\u2019s signature legislation, BCBSNC is considering getting out of the Affordable Care Act marketplace.\n\nBrad Wilson, BCBSNC\u2019s CEO, tells CBS North Carolina that the cost of offering plans under the Affordable Care Act in every county in the state is unsustainable.\n\n\u201cWe do not take this analysis, which we must undertake, lightly at all,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cIt is clear that changes need to be made.\u201d\n\nBlue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina, the state\u2019s largest insurer, could decide to change the plans that are offered, try to get federal regulators to improve the system or get out of the ACA marketplace altogether.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t continue to offer all that we\u2019re offering if the net result is a $282 million loss year over year over year,\u201d Wilson said.\n\nInsurance rates have jumped as Blue Cross struggles to break even.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s obscene,\u201d said customer Kerry Occhino. \u201cHonestly, it would be cheaper for us to just pay everything out of pocket.\u201d\n\nBlue Cross has also taken heat for significant pay raises for executives during the financial crisis. Wilson\u2019s pay jumped about a third to nearly $3.8 million last year.\n\n\u201cOur board takes all compensation, not just executive compensation, very seriously,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cThey make the judgment not only about performance but at the levels that everyone in our company should be paid in order to attract and retain the appropriate talent.\u201d\n\nAs for the system failure at the first of the year, Wilson said that the problems were not anticipated and the company is sorry for the issues they caused customers.\n\n\u201cWell, we certainly didn\u2019t anticipate what happened, happening. So, let me start there,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cWe certainly understand the difficulties that it\u2019s presented to our customers. We apologize for that.\u201d\n\nThe system failure at Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina offices created problems for customers, from resolving billing issue to even getting access to health care.\n\nWilson said there were backup systems in place but they weren\u2019t good enough.\n\n\u201cI tried four times anywhere from an hour to two hours without even getting a live person,\u201d said customer Peter Cusden.\n\nCustomer Ann McConnell stayed with it even longer. \u201cI stayed on hold 20 hours and probably spent another 10 to 15 talking,\u201d she said.\n\nCBS North Carolina obtained nearly a thousand pages worth of emails from the State Department of Insurance as the crisis unfolded. They show state employees trained to deal with these problems found some of the responses from BCBSNC \u201cvery frustrating and confusing.\u201d To make matters worse, some customers received an incorrect number to call to resolve their billing issues.\n\n\u201cWe certainly didn\u2019t anticipate and understand the avalanche, is the term that I would use, right at the outset,\u201d Wilson said.\n\nSince the crisis began, the Department of Insurance has extra staff trying to help customers and Blue Cross Blue Shield has trained more people to handle calls.\n\nBut some customers are still having trouble.\n\n\u201cAny customer who has suffered any financial loss, we have and will continue to make whole,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cAn apology, I know, doesn\u2019t make them feel a whole lot better if they were inconvenienced as a result of having a missed appointment or didn\u2019t get a prescription filled timely. What is appropriate is for us to intervene on their behalf to get them that appointment again or make sure that prescription can be filled and will continue to be filled.\u201d\n\nWilson said things should return to normal in a matter of weeks. \u201cOur response could have been faster,\u201d he said. \u201cWe wished it had been. But, I can tell you it wasn\u2019t for the lack of trying.\u201d\n\nThe N.C. Department of Insurance is onsite at Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina to investigate the system failure. Wayne Goodwin, the state\u2019s insurance commissioner, said that Blue Cross could face fines up to $1,000 per day per violation that investigators find.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina and its customers have had a rocky start to 2016 due to the insurance company's system failure.", "application-name": "WNCN", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.doapps.android.mln.MLN_4ef95b9ddabd80873ba6a8406f5bfa55", "og": {"site_name": "WNCN", "description": "Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina and its customers have had a rocky start to 2016 due to the insurance company\u2019s system failure.", "title": "Blue Cross, still dealing with system failure issues, may drop ObamaCare marketplace", "url": "http://wncn.com/2016/05/05/blue-cross-still-dealing-with-system-failure-issues-may-drop-obamacare/", "image": {"width": 620, "identifier": "https://mgtvwncn.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/ceo-brad-wilson.png", "height": 359}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina and its customers have had a rocky start to 2016 due to the insurance company\u2019s system failure.", "creator": "@wncn", "image": {"src": "https://mgtvwncn.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/ceo-brad-wilson.png?w=640"}, "title": "Blue Cross, still dealing with system failure issues, may drop ObamaCare marketplace", "site": "wncn", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "generator": "WordPress.com", "msvalidate.01": "25404283363C09DE121A55A903F03873", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=425414520", "fb": {"pages": 69688774749}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "google-site-verification": "JziH-ux2vlTCnig0bnUsUMzGF0B1kdNRMW7oV48jIEc", "keywords": ",Consumer Protection, Investigates, News, North Carolina news, Politics, Top Videos,Michael Hyland", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WNCNTV", "published_time": "2016-05-05T19:00:51+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-06T03:19:21+00:00"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://wncn.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/caee67290db345cd25db23a5a27c462f?s=16"}, "article_summary": "RALEIGH, N.C.
