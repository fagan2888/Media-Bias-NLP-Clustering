Cut by the New Orleans Saints at the end of training camp, Hopkins was signed in part because of the strength of his leg, which led to a touchback on four of his five kickoffs.\n\nSEE ALSO: Matt Jones, revamped defense help Redskins hold on for victory over Rams\n\nHe also kicked a 46-yard field goal with 53 seconds remaining in the first quarter, sending the ball roughly halfway up the uprights.\n\n\u201cTo be honest, I didn\u2019t try to approach it any different than any other game that I\u2019ve played in,\u201d Hopkins said. \u201cI definitely felt a little more juice, a little more adrenaline, but as far as my approach went \u2014 pregame, everything else, my mindset, taking my steps back, whatever it may be \u2014 everything was, I tried to make it as much as the same as I can.\u201d\n\nThe only one of Hopkins\u2018 five kickoffs that was returned was taken by running back Benny Cunningham, who fielded the ball eight yards deep and returned it to the Rams\u2019 20-yard line.\n\nHopkins was drafted out of Florida State by the Buffalo Bills in 2013, but he spent that season on injured reserve after injuring his groin. He was only on the Saints\u2019 practice squad for the final month last year.\n\n\u201cI know I didn\u2019t do a lot [on Sunday],\u201d Hopkins said, \u201cbut it was nice just being part of a team when it matters.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Signed last Monday by the Redskins, Hopkins played in his first regular-season game, sending all five of his kickoffs into the end zone and making a 46-yard field goal in the Redskins' 24-10 victory.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Signed last Monday by the Redskins, Hopkins played in his first regular-season game, sending all five of his kickoffs into the end zone and making a 46-yard field goal in the Redskins\u2019 24-10 victory.", "title": "Dustin Hopkins \u2018kind of in the clouds\u2019 after making Redskins debut", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/sep/20/dustin-hopkins-kind-clouds-after-redskins-debut/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/20/AP_510677154344.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/20/AP_510677154344.jpg", "description": "Signed last Monday by the Redskins, Hopkins played in his first regular-season game, sending all five of his kickoffs into the end zone and making a 46-yard field goal in the Redskins' 24-10 victory.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Dustin Hopkins \u2018kind of in the clouds\u2019 after making Redski"}, "Author": "Zac Boyer", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Dustin Hopkins"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc757\"", "article_summary": "LANDOVER \u2014 Dustin Hopkins didn\u2019t hear the sarcastic cheer that reverberated through FedEx Field when he sent the opening kickoff through the end zone.\n\u201cI was kind of in the clouds,\u201d Hopkins said shortly after playing in his first game with the Washington Redskins, a 24-10 victory over the St. Louis Rams.\n\u201cTo be honest, I didn\u2019t try to approach it any different than any other game that I\u2019ve played in,\u201d Hopkins said.\n\u201cI know I didn\u2019t do a lot [on Sunday],\u201d Hopkins said, \u201cbut it was nice just being part of a team when it matters.\u201d\nHopkins was drafted out of Florida State by the Buffalo Bills in 2013, but he spent that season on injured reserve after injuring his groin."}
