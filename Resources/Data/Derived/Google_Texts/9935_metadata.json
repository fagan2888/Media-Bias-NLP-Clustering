But a subsidiary element obligates Tehran to cooperate with the IAEA and its probe of the allegations.\n\nThe investigation has been deadlocked for years with Tehran asserting the allegations are based on false intelligence from the U.S., Israel and other adversaries. But Iran and the U.N. agency agreed last month to wrap up the investigation by December, when the IAEA plans to issue a final assessment on the allegations. Saturday was the target date for Tehran to provide documents to the IAEA related to the investigation and its version of what they mean.\n\nBoth Iran and the agency were upbeat when announcing the agreement last month. However, Western diplomats from IAEA member nations who are familiar with the probe are doubtful Tehran will diverge from claiming that all its nuclear activities are \u2013 and were \u2013 peaceful, despite what they say is evidence to the contrary.\n\nThey say the agency will be able to report in December. But that assessment is unlikely to be unequivocal because chances are slim that Iran will present all the evidence the agency wants or give it the total freedom of movement it needs to follow up the allegations.\n\nHowever, IAEA Director General Yuiya Amano has said the questions the agency wants answers to are still the same ones that were raised in a 2011 report, according to The Wall Street Journal. The agency delved into activities ranging from high-explosive weapons tests to studies on how to build a weapon.\n\nAmano told the journal it was his \u201clegal obligation\u201d to protect confidential agreements between Iran and the IAEA, though he said he has provided some details to the Obama administration.\n\nThe agency\u2019s refusal to detail all the agreements has concerned some U.S. lawmakers who fear the agency will give Tehran the \u201call-clear\u201d without gaining any new insight into Iran\u2019s past work, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nU.S. lawmakers are specifically concerned that the IAEA will not get access to the controversial Parchin site, where tests of explosive devices are believed to have began in the early 2000s.\n\nIran has repeatedly denied the IAEA access to Parchin.\n\nThe report is expected to be approved by the IAEA's board, which includes the United States and other powerful nations that negotiated the July 14 agreement. They do not want to upend their July 14 deal, and will see the December report as closing the books on the issue.\n\nClick for more from The Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.modified": "2015-08-16 03:31:01 EDT", "dcterms.abstract": "Iran on Saturday gave the United Nations nuclear agency documents linked to the agency\u2019s investigation of allegations that Tehran tried to develop nuclear weapons, along with a confidential explanation that is unlikely to veer from previous Iranian denials of work on such weapons.", "twitter": {"description": "Iran on Saturday gave the United Nations nuclear agency documents linked to the agency\u2019s investigation of allegations that Tehran tried to develop nuclear weapons, along with a confidential explanation that is unlikely to veer from previous Iranian denials of work on such weapons.", "title": "Iran hands UN agency docs linked to alleged nuke arms work", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/world/2015/08/16/iran-hands-un-agency-docs-allegedly-linked-to-nuke-arms-work.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/2015/08/15/0/0/081515_anhq_rothfus2_640.jpg?ve=1", "creator": "@foxnews", "site": "@foxnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.publisher": "Fox News", "parsely-metadata": "{\"author\":\"\",\"subSection\":\"world\",\"title\":\"Iran hands UN agency docs linked to alleged nuke arms work\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/2015/08/15/0/0/081515_anhq_rothfus2_640.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-08-16T07:25:12Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxnews.com/world/2015/08/16/iran-hands-un-agency-docs-allegedly-linked-to-nuke-arms-work.html\",\"type\":\"article\",\"identifier\":\"254856a5-27ae-4327-ad04-8a4d9ec4d3e2\",\"section\":\"world\"}", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "description": "Iran on Saturday gave the United Nations nuclear agency documents linked to the agency\u2019s investigation of allegations that Tehran tried to develop nuclear weapons, along with a confidential explanation that is unlikely to veer from previous Iranian denials of work on such weapons.", "dc.description": "Iran on Saturday gave the United Nations nuclear agency documents linked to the agency\u2019s investigation of allegations that Tehran tried to develop nuclear weapons, along with a confidential explanation that is unlikely to veer from previous Iranian denials of work on such weapons.", "dc.identifier": "254856a5-27ae-4327-ad04-8a4d9ec4d3e2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "pagetype": "article", "prism.channel": "fnc", "prism.section": "world", "fb": {"app_id": 113186182048399}, "dc.source": "FoxNews.com", "dc.language": "en-US", "dc.title": "Iran Hands Un Agency Docs Linked To Alleged Nuke Arms Work", "dcterms.created": "2015-08-16 03:31:01 EDT", "og": {"site_name": "Fox News", "description": "Iran on Saturday gave the United Nations nuclear agency documents linked to the agency\u2019s investigation of allegations that Tehran tried to develop nuclear weapons, along with a confidential explanation that is unlikely to veer from previous Iranian denials of work on such weapons.", "title": "Iran hands UN agency docs linked to alleged nuke arms work | Fox News", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/world/2015/08/16/iran-hands-un-agency-docs-allegedly-linked-to-nuke-arms-work.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/2015/08/15/0/0/081515_anhq_rothfus2_640.jpg?ve=1", "type": "article"}, "dc.type": "Text.Article", "dc.date": "2015-08-16", "parsely-page": "{\"author\":\"\",\"subSection\":\"world\",\"title\":\"Iran hands UN agency docs linked to alleged nuke arms work\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/2015/08/15/0/0/081515_anhq_rothfus2_640.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-08-16T07:25:12Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxnews.com/world/2015/08/16/iran-hands-un-agency-docs-allegedly-linked-to-nuke-arms-work.html\",\"post_id\":\"254856a5-27ae-4327-ad04-8a4d9ec4d3e2\",\"type\":\"article\",\"section\":\"world\"}"}, "article_summary": "Click for more from The Wall Street Journal.\nThe nuclear deal\u2019s main focus is curbing Iran\u2019s present nuclear program that could be used to make weapons.\nBoth Iran and the agency were upbeat when announcing the agreement last month.\nIran on Saturday gave the United Nations nuclear agency documents linked to the agency\u2019s investigation of allegations that Tehran tried to develop nuclear weapons, along with a confidential explanation that is unlikely to veer from previous Iranian denials of work on such weapons.\nBut Iran and the U.N. agency agreed last month to wrap up the investigation by December, when the IAEA plans to issue a final assessment on the allegations."}
