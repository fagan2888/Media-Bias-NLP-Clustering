The tradition, location and opportunity were too much for Ace Escobedo to pass on — so he committed this weekend to Pennsylvania of the Ivy League.

“Oh, my gosh, it’s a dream come true,”‘ the senior defensive lineman at Regis Jesuit said. “We started the recruiting process after my sophomore season and I never imagined a chance at D-I(AA) school in the Ivy League.”

Plus, Escobedo said, it’s funny — I’ve been to the East Coast three times and each time was to visit schools.”

Escobedo, born Alan Coye Escobedo — hence the reference to Ace — said he visited seven Ivy schools before settling on Penn, located in Philadelphia, about 75 miles from the Atlantic Ocean and full of tradition. When Escobedo becomes a Quaker, he’ll be playing at Franklin Field.

“The history of that field is amazing,” Escobedo said.

At 6-foot-3, 270 pounds, he will play noseguard and defensive tackle for this year’s Raiders, then begin at noseguard as a Quaker.

Escobedo finished his junior year with a 4.15 grade-point average and a 3.8 cumulative, and is smart enough to realize the opportunity in front of him.

“The common misconception of the Ivy League is it has smart kids playing football on the side,” he said. “When I went out there to visit, I saw how the kids take it so seriously.”

Regis Jesuit, 10-2 a year ago, began at No. 5 in the Associated Press Class 5A preseason media poll.
