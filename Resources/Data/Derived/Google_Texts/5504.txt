A group of nonprofits, businesses and agencies is helping low income families in the Charlottesville area file taxes for free.

The Monticello Area Community Action Agency (MACAA) is one the organizations that makes up the Thomas Jefferson Area Earned Income Tax Credit Coalition.

Tax preparers at MACAA say families will often see a big return.

â€œIt just tickles us to see the smiles on people's faces. They get some fat refunds! I'm serious, between federal and state they get some fat refunds. Just to see the smiles on their faces, and then we try to talk about ways to make that money last," said Lindell Chavis with MACAA.

Families that make less than a combined total of $55,000 a year are eligible for free service.

Help is also available at the University of Virginia Credit Union and United Way Thomas Jefferson Area.
