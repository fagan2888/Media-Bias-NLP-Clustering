Its executives were grilled over the news that their individual insurance plans would offer access to only 16 of the state\u2019s 26 hospitals.\n\nThis time, Harvard Pilgrim and its partners were ready with a slick banner, scripted statements, and catchy title ready to go. It\u2019s all been in the works for a while.\n\nCEO Eric Schulz says it\u2019s called ElevateHealth, a narrow network plan that rolls out in December.\n\n\u201cFor all too long in the health system today, there has kind of been an arm-wrestling going on between health plans and hospitals and physicians, trying to negotiate the highest dollar or the lowest dollar,\u201d says Schultz.\n\n\u201cAnd that has fed this volume game, if you will\u2026 how can we do more to maximize revenue?\u201d\n\nThat changes with this model, but revenue, of course, still matters.\n\nThree Companies To Share Risks, Rewards\n\nRather than negotiating, Dartmouth-Hitchcock, Elliot Health Systems and Harvard Pilgrim will share any profits. To minimize expenses, they\u2019ll try to coordinate patient care to keep people healthier.\n\nAnd there are only 5 hospitals statewide that people can choose from.\n\nThis stripped-down offering is going to hit the market at a rate 10% less than what other employer-based plans currently cost.\n\nGreg Marceau, a broker with Bedford-based Infantine Insurance, says businesses are hungry for anything that can lower their employee health insurance costs. But he says the savings may actually not be enough.\n\n\u201cThe problem I see is that the 10% really doesn\u2019t make that much of a difference,\u201d says Marceau.\n\n\u201cIf you have a $400 single rate [per month], or $1,600, $1,700 family rates and beyond, 10% is really just a drop in the bucket.\u201d\n\n\"The problem I see is that the 10% really doesn't make that much of a difference.\"\n\nMarceau says he imagines companies would offer the ElevateHealth plan alongside more traditional full-benefit packages, and pass the choice\u2014and potential savings\u2014onto their employees.\n\nAnd remember, starting in 2015 under the Affordable Care Act, employers with over 50 employees that don\u2019t offer coverage face a hefty tax.\n\nDavid E. Williams, president of the Boston-based consulting firm Health Business Group, says some of those companies worried about the ACA may like this choice, too.\n\n\u201cUltimately, the employer wants to offer high quality health benefits to their employees, not run afoul of the law, and still have a reasonable cost.\u201d\n\nPrice Matters Most\n\nEmployers will have to weigh these options carefully, but Williams says most individual consumers have already made up their mind. He says the bottom line for people who have to buy their own coverage is that cost, not access, is what matters most.\n\n\u201cIndividuals have shown when they go and actually see the difference prices, they are willing to make tradeoffs between cost and benefits, including narrow networks,\u201d says Williams.\n\nIndividuals can\u2019t yet buy Harvard Pilgrim\u2019s new offering. It\u2019s only being sold to employers in the small and large group markets for now.\n\nBut that likely changes in 2015, when the company says it will start selling plans in the new health exchange marketplaces.\n\nThat will make it a direct competitor to Anthem, that says its narrow network plan is going to be 25% cheaper than its traditional offerings.\n\nLinda Blumberg, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, says that in the exchange, where all the costs and benefits are clearly laid out for the consumer in one website, cheap will matter.\n\n\u201cWhat we know is that exchanges are creating a situation where there is going to be a lot more comparison information across plans,\u201d says Blumberg. \u201cSo we are expecting people to be pretty sensitive to premium price.\u201d\n\nBlumberg sees an overwhelming demand for less expensive health insurance\u2026narrow networks, she says, are just one way to get there.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health", "description": "For the second time in less than a week, the health care landscape in New Hampshire is absorbing a major announcement.", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://nhpr.org/post/health-insurance-shake-continues-nh", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/nhpr/files/styles/medium/public/201309/IMG_1466.JPG", "type": "article", "description": "For the second time in less than a week, the health care landscape in New Hampshire is absorbing a major announcement.", "title": "Health Insurance Shake Up Continues In N.H."}, "story_id": 220787922, "twitter": {"site": "@nhpr", "card": "summary", "creator": "@bookmannhpr"}, "author": "Todd Bookman", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Health Insurance Shake Up Continues In N.H."}, "nid": 34642, "datePublished": "2013-09-09", "keywords": "Affordable Care Act, Health Insurance, Health Exchange", "wordCount": 775, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "On Monday, two hospital\u2014Dartmouth-Hitchcock and Elliot Health Systems\u2014announced they plan to partner with Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, an insurance company, to launch a new limited health plan for employers.\nGreg Marceau, a broker with Bedford-based Infantine Insurance, says businesses are hungry for anything that can lower their employee health insurance costs.\nFor the second time in less than a week, the health care landscape in New Hampshire is absorbing a major announcement.\nIts executives were grilled over the news that their individual insurance plans would offer access to only 16 of the state\u2019s 26 hospitals.\nThis announcement was a lot more polished than Anthem Blue Cross, who made public its plan for a narrow plan last week in front of a panel of lawmakers."}
