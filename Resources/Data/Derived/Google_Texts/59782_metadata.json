This would have prioritized adolescents and young adults in receiving health care and put infants and the elderly at the end of the line. Samuel Kerstein of the University of Maryland and Greg Bogner of New York University wrote a dispassionate critique of the proposal, concluding that it lacked an \u201cadequate moral foundation\u201d and failed to \u201cprovide meaningful guidance on a range of central issues.\u201d\n\nMany Obamacare critics worried such an allocation system would be used sooner or later to ration services within the program. It was not an unreasonable fear. Virtually all the writing of the legislation took place behind closed doors, and one of the priorities was to lower costs. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s statement that we won\u2019t know what is in the law until after it was passed certainly didn\u2019t help sooth these anxieties.\n\nNow Zeke is back with a major article in The Atlantic, in which he provides a rationale for death at age 75. In his opinion, people older than 75 are annoying. They aren\u2019t as productive as they used to be, don\u2019t \u201ccontribute to work, society, the world.\u201d They are more likely to be disabled, \u201ca state that may not be worse than death but is nonetheless deprived.\u201d Plus, they are a pain in the ass: \u201cthey set expectations, render judgments, impose their opinions, interfere, and are generally a looming presence for even adult children.\u201d\n\nZeke is only 57, but I would say he already qualifies on most of those measurements. I can\u2019t see that he contributes much to society and the world, and he certainly \u201crenders judgments, imposes his opinions, and interferes\u201d where he isn\u2019t wanted. And I would guess he isn\u2019t as productive as he once was. Why wait until he is 75 years old?\n\nYou\u2019re Just a Statistic Zeke admits there are exceptions to all of this. Why, he even once worked with an 80-year-old economist who was quite useful. And the article includes a pull quote (so you know it\u2019s important) that states, \u201cThe average age at which Nobel Prize winning physicists make their discovery is 48.\u201d This is supposed to show (I guess) that older people aren\u2019t all that clever. In fact, it doesn\u2019t support that idea at all. If the average (median?) age is 48, then half are making their discovery after 48, possibly well into their 60s, or even (gasp) their 70s.\n\nThat may be Zeke\u2019s biggest flaw\u2014he is arbitrary. And that may be Zeke\u2019s biggest flaw\u2014he is arbitrary. There is nothing magical about the age of 75. Some people have rich lives long beyond that. Other people become senile well before. But like most Progressives, Zeke sees only cookie-cutter people. In his mind, we are all the same, just a pile of numbers and statistics.\n\nHe has no idea how offensive this is. He genuinely seems to think that once someone is stamped with the label \u201cDisabled,\u201d they are less than human. He says, \u201cWe [Americans] are growing old, and our older years are not of high quality.\u201d What an idiotic statement. What is \u201chigh quality?\u201d Is it okay with him if my life is not \u201chigh\u201d quality but still \u201cpretty good\u201d quality? Is his standard of high quality the same as mine? Are there no younger people with \u201clow-quality\u201d lives?\n\nBut he is also na\u00efve. He cites a study of aging, and says \u201c[t]he results show that as people age, there is a progressive erosion of physical functioning.\u201d Good grief. He needed a study to know that? Everyone has known that since the dawn of man.\n\nThe man is 87 and has slowed down, but he is happy. Only Zeke Emanuel would see this as a problem. He writes of his 87-year old father, who had a heart attack about ten years ago. \u201cSince then he has not been the same. Once the prototype of a hyperactive Emanuel, suddenly his walking, his talking, his humor got slower. Today he can swim, read the newspaper, needle his kids on the phone, and still live with my mother in their own house. But everything seems sluggish.\u201d He also quotes his father as saying, \u201c I have slowed down tremendously. That is a fact. I no longer make rounds at the hospital or teach.\u201d Zeke adds, \u201cDespite this, he also said he was happy.\u201d\n\nThe man is 87 and has slowed down, but he is happy. Only Zeke Emanuel would see this as a problem. Apparently, in Zeke\u2019s mind the failure to be hyperactive is worthy of death.\n\nEmanuel Thinks He Can Quantify Your Worth As it happens, I agree with him about my own life. I, too, have advance directives instructing caregivers not to prolong it artificially. I don\u2019t see much value in squeezing out every extra day, especially if I am in pain. I\u2019m 67, my hearing is shot, and my vision is getting worse. I don\u2019t normally talk about these things because no one wants to hear it and I\u2019m not looking for sympathy.\n\nOn the other hand, since I retired, I\u2019ve been able to read some of the great classics I never had time for when I was working. I give back to my church and my community. I do what I can to nurture my children and grandchildren and can encourage younger colleagues in their work. And I\u2019m writing a book about the history of health reform. Is that so very bad? Is it likely to stop in eight years when I turn 75?\n\nNow, Zeke also takes a moment to consider the spiritual side of things:\n\nI also think my view conjures up spiritual and existential reasons for people to scorn and reject it. Many of us have suppressed, actively or passively, thinking about God, heaven and hell, and whether we return to the worms. We are agnostics or atheists, or just don\u2019t think about whether there is a God and why she should care at all about mere mortals. We also avoid constantly thinking about the purpose of our lives and the mark we will leave. Is making money, chasing the dream, all worth it? Indeed, most of us have found a way to live our lives comfortably without acknowledging, much less answering, these big questions on a regular basis. We have gotten into a productive routine that helps us ignore them. And I don\u2019t purport to have the answers.\n\nHere, Zeke reveals his narcissism. He has certain attitudes, and assumes the rest of the world is the same. But that may underlie his desire to die at 75, as well. He can\u2019t stand the thought that someday he will not be as wonderful as he thinks he has always been.", "article_metadata": {"item-publish-date": "Tue, 23 Sep 2014 07:43:35 EDT", "og": {"site_name": "The Federalist", "description": "Ezekiel Emanuel cannot stand to think that, someday, he might not be as fabulous as he is now.", "title": "Zeke Emanuel Wants You To Die At 75", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/3707362020_acc6c26f0d_b.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-09-29T07:24:36+00:00", "url": "http://thefederalist.com/2014/09/23/zeke-emanuel-wants-you-to-die-at-75/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Federalist", "description": "Ezekiel Emanuel cannot stand to think that, someday, he might not be as fabulous as he is now.", "title": "Zeke Emanuel Wants You To Die At 75", "image": {"src": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/3707362020_acc6c26f0d_b.jpg"}, "creator": "@FDRLST", "site": "@FDRLST", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article": {"section": "Health Care", "tag": "aging,death,death panels,end-of-life care,Ezekiel Emanuel,Greg Bogner,Nancy Pelosi,narcissism,narcissist,productivity,Samuel Kerstein,The Atlantic", "published_time": "2014-09-23T07:43:35+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-29T07:24:36+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Ezekiel Emanuel cannot stand to think that, someday, he might not be as fabulous as he is now."}, "article_summary": "What is \u201chigh quality?\u201d Is it okay with him if my life is not \u201chigh\u201d quality but still \u201cpretty good\u201d quality?\nNow Zeke is back with a major article in The Atlantic, in which he provides a rationale for death at age 75.\nOnly Zeke Emanuel would see this as a problem.\nHe says, \u201cWe [Americans] are growing old, and our older years are not of high quality.\u201d What an idiotic statement.\nWe are agnostics or atheists, or just don\u2019t think about whether there is a God and why she should care at all about mere mortals."}
