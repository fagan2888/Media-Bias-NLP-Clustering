Given that a large portion of the attendees \u200ewere not from the United States, I also tried to ascertain what my colleagues across the globe in the \u200eClinical Informatics space were thinking.\n\nMuch of the discussions centered around \u200etelemedicine/telehealth, the use of social media in healthcare, and mobile health or mHealth and \u200emobile medical applications. The latter may be defined as a mobile application that meets the Food \u200eand Drug Administration (FDA) definition of a medical device and is intended to be used as an \u200eaccessary to a regulated device, or to transform a platform into a regulated medical device.\u200e\n\nQuality and cost-effectiveness in the context of the delivery of healthcare was important, along with \u200eits increasingly patient-centered nature. There were discussions about the seemingly antiquated laws \u200ethat make it difficult for telemedicine to keep up with the technology. For example, some wondered \u200ewhy a patient in New York had to have his or her x-ray read by a physician licensed in New York, when \u200ethe film was being read in Bangalore.\n\nSome were concerned about the privacy and security issues \u200eassociated with patients being on social media for a chronic condition, and whether the information \u200ethey had was credible. Others, however, thought that such social media sites made it possible for \u200epatients to have information much sooner than waiting for the results of research studies to be \u200epublished in journals that they may or may not be able to access.\u200e\n\nIt seemed to be a common consensus that the use of mobile devices in the delivery of healthcare and \u200ein obtaining healthcare knowledge was becoming ubiquitous. Physicians and other caregivers wanted \u200eto use their devices for a variety of purposes, and many prefer their own devices to a laptop or work\u200e station with which they were provided. The BYOD (bring your own device) concept was certainly on \u200ethe minds of attendees and its anticipated and unanticipated consequences. Patients also now BYOD \u200efor their care, e.g., whether it is in the context of locating additional information about what malady \u200ethey might have or accessing the results of their lab test.\u200e\n\nThe recent FDA Guidance for Mobile Medical Applications was on the minds of many. Particularly, \u200esome individuals, including entrepreneurs were wondering whether the guidance would facilitate the \u200edevelopment of such devices under health reform, or stymie it. Unfortunately, as I have penned in \u200eanother venue, the guidance is not clear.\n\nThe FDA provides some idea of the types of mobile medical \u200eapps that it believes are subject to regulatory oversight, and those that it will exercise enforcement \u200ediscretion and not seek to regulate at this time. We know that a mobile medical app that is an extension \u200eof a medical device by connecting to one will be considered a regulated device if it displays, stores, \u200eanalyzes or transmits patient-specific data.\n\nWe know a mobile medical app will not be considered a \u200edevice over which the FDA will exercise jurisdiction, if it helps patients self-manage their disease or \u200econditions without providing specific treatment or treatment suggestion. We know mobile medical \u200eapps which perform patient-specific analyses and provide patient-specific diagnoses or treatment \u200erecommendations will be regulated. However, ones that enable patients or providers to interact with \u200ePersonal Health Records or Electronic Health Record systems will not be considered a medical device \u200eover which the FDA will exercise jurisdiction.\u200e\n\nUnder health reform, facilitated by the Affordable Care Act, (ACA) many can envision that mobile \u200emedical apps will become increasingly important in this new patient-centered care environment. We \u200eknow that entrepreneurs and others will seek to develop applications which will help to implement \u200eadvancements in science, including evidence-based medicine and biomedical informatics before much \u200eof the results are published in the scientific literature.\n\nWe know that if patients are demanding that \u200ethey be able to e-mail their clinicians, and that many clinicians are demanding that someone pay them \u200efor their being accessible via e-mail to better provide care for their patients, the ACA will only result in \u200emore mobile medical applications being developed and more technology being employed in the \u200edelivery of healthcare.\u200e\n\nReturning from the AMIA meetings, I consulted with one of my colleagues at the Schwabe firm, Bruce \u200eHowell, who is in my opinion one of the leading ACA experts in the country, about mobile medical apps \u200eand health reform. In fact, Mr. Howell was asked to teach the inaugural course on the ACA at the \u200eWillamette Law School this winter.\n\nMr. Howell not only agreed with the consensus that I saw at the \u200eAMIA meetings regarding mobile medical apps, he also noted that telemedicine/telehealth and social \u200emedia were key. Citing his background in genetics, he noted that these are only first steps, and that \u200ethe advances we will see in the delivery of healthcare information and technology will transcend the \u200elandscape and hopefully result in better quality care which will be most cost-effective.\u200e\n\nI was wondering whether Mr. Howell\u2019s course was open to the public, and then my assistant reminded \u200eme that in addition to practicing healthcare law in the winter, as I have done for the last 34 years, I am \u200ealso taking two courses at OHSU and co-teaching one on Health Information Privacy and Security. I can \u200eonly imagine how much work it will take to update the latter. Maybe I can \u201cborrow\u201d some of Bruce\u2019s \u200ematerials.\u200e", "article_metadata": {"MobileOptimized": "width", "viewport": "width=device-width", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "HandheldFriendly": "true"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca1c9\"", "article_summary": "Much of the discussions centered around \u200etelemedicine/telehealth, the use of social media in healthcare, and mobile health or mHealth and \u200emobile medical applications.\nWe know mobile medical \u200eapps which perform patient-specific analyses and provide patient-specific diagnoses or treatment \u200erecommendations will be regulated.\nMr. Howell not only agreed with the consensus that I saw at the \u200eAMIA meetings regarding mobile medical apps, he also noted that telemedicine/telehealth and social \u200emedia were key.\nWe know that a mobile medical app that is an extension \u200eof a medical device by connecting to one will be considered a regulated device if it displays, stores, \u200eanalyzes or transmits patient-specific data.\nHowever, ones that enable patients or providers to interact with \u200ePersonal Health Records or Electronic Health Record systems will not be considered a medical device \u200eover which the FDA will exercise jurisdiction.\u200eUnder health reform, facilitated by the Affordable Care Act, (ACA) many can envision that mobile \u200emedical apps will become increasingly important in this new patient-centered care environment."}
