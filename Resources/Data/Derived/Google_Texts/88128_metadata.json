Now his mannequins, and others like them, have become the standard in stores across Venezuela, serving as an exaggerated, sometimes polarizing, vision of the female form that calls out from the doorways of tiny shops selling cheap clothes to working-class women and the display windows of fancy boutiques in multilevel shopping malls.\n\nMr. \u00c1lvarez\u2019s art may have been meant to imitate life. But in a culture saturated with such images, life is returning the compliment.\n\n\u201cYou see a woman like this and you say, \u2018Wow, I want to look like her,\u2019 \u201d said Reina Parada, as she sanded a mannequin torso in the workshop. Although she cannot afford it, she said, she would like to get implant surgery someday. \u201cIt gives you better self-esteem.\u201d\n\nCosmetic procedures are so fashionable here that a woman with implants is often casually referred to as \u201can operated woman.\u201d Women freely talk about their surgeries, and mannequin makers jokingly refer to the creations as being \u201coperated\u201d as well. Mr. \u00c1lvarez\u2019s wife and business partner, Nereida Corro, calls her best-selling mannequin, with its inflated proportions, the \u201cnormal\u201d model.\n\nThe embrace of plastic surgery clashes with the government\u2019s socialist ideology and frequent talk of creating a society free of the taint of commercialism. Venezuela\u2019s longtime leader, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, who died in March after 14 years in office, railed against the procedures, saying it was \u201cmonstrous\u201d that poor women were spending money on breast surgeries when they had trouble making ends meet.\n\nBut the same resource that the government relies on \u2014 the world\u2019s largest estimated petroleum reserves \u2014 has long fed a culture of easy money and consumerism here, along with a penchant for the quick fix and instant gratification.\n\n\u201cVenezuela is known for its oil, and it\u2019s known for its beauty,\u201d said Lauren Gulbas, a feminist scholar and anthropologist at Dartmouth College, who has studied attitudes toward plastic surgery in Venezuela. \u201cThat ties into why it\u2019s perceived as so important to Venezuelans.\u201d\n\nBeauty took on a particularly important role in the late 1970s and \u201980s when the country\u2019s beauty queens, already a national obsession, were crowned Miss Universe three times. Their success on the international stage took on special resonance. It came as the country was grappling with the frustrated expectations of the 1970s oil boom and the deep economic downturn that followed, bringing with it a crisis of national confidence.\n\nAnd the beauty queens\u2019 fame helped fuel a fascination with cosmetic surgery and procedures like breast implants, tummy tucks, nose jobs and injections to firm the buttocks.\n\nOsmel Sousa, the longtime head of the Miss Venezuela pageant, takes credit for the trend. He recommended a nose job for Venezuela\u2019s first Miss Universe, which he says made her victory possible more than three decades ago.\n\n\u201cWhen there is a defect, I correct it,\u201d Mr. Sousa said. \u201cIf it can be easily fixed with surgery, then why not do it?\u201d\n\nFor Mr. Sousa, beauty really is skin deep: \u201cI say that inner beauty doesn\u2019t exist. That\u2019s something that unpretty women invented to justify themselves.\u201d\n\nNaturally, not everyone sees it that way. Several women\u2019s groups protested against the Miss Venezuela beauty pageant last month, criticizing pressures on women to conform to the artificial aesthetic.\n\nThe little data available indicates that Venezuelan women do not get plastic surgery more than their counterparts in many other countries. But Ms. Gulbas, the anthropologist, said the surgeries take on an elevated status thanks to the importance of beauty here and a belief that cosmetic procedures will help project a successful image.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s this notion in Venezuela of \u2018buena presencia,\u2019 \u2018good presence,\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cThat communicates that you have certain aspects that say you are a hard worker, a good worker, an honest person.\u201d She added, \u201cThere\u2019s a virtue associated with looking a certain way.\u201d\n\nEach day, Yaritza Molina arranges several mannequins at the entrance to the small clothing shop she manages in Coro, a city in western Venezuela, always careful to place two ahead of the others. \u201cThese are the princesses,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause they have the best bust.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have lots of clients that come here and say, \u2018I want to look like that mannequin,\u2019 \u201d Ms. Molina said. \u201cI tell them, \u2018O.K., then get an operation.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAs in many countries, there are dangers to the obsession. Over the last two years, the local news media has reported several cases in which women died after receiving faulty injections meant to firm up their buttocks, often in unlicensed clinics.\n\nThe jump in sales provided by the large-busted mannequins allowed Ms. Corro and Mr. \u00c1lvarez to build a new workshop this year, where they are made by hand in a surprisingly low-tech process.\n\nDozens of partly finished mannequins stood in neat rows, like silent robots with overblown chests, taking the exaggerated female aesthetic that predominates here and pushing it to its furthest limits.\n\nOn a recent day, about a dozen people were at work. Some applied a thin coating of a brown pasty resin and fiberglass strips inside molds, left it to dry and then pried out the artificial torsos, arms, and the fronts and backs of plastic bodies. Others glued the mannequin parts together, spray-painted them or set finished mannequins ready for delivery in the back of a pickup truck, with the words \u201cJesus is my peace\u201d written in large letters on the windshield.\n\nYucca and corn grew in small farm patches nearby. From a house across the street, the face of Mr. Ch\u00e1vez peered out from a poster left over from last year\u2019s election. It seemed to peep over the wall at the inflated female forms inside the workshop.\n\nMs. Corro, the co-owner, explained the changes in the mannequins over just a few years: bigger breasts, bigger buttocks, svelte waists. Until recently, \u201cthe mannequins were natural, just like the women were natural,\u201d she said. \u201cThe transformation has been both of the woman and of the mannequin.\u201d\n\nMary Angola, another mannequin maker in Valencia, said that older styles came from Europe or the United States, and hardly reflected the physiques of real women around her.\n\n\u201cThey make them so skinny,\u201d she said.\n\nA few miles from Ms. Corro\u2019s workshop, workers used a similar process to build mannequins in a small rooftop workshop run by Daniela Mieles, 25, and her family.\n\nWhile Ms. Corro\u2019s mannequins took a quantum leap in body shape several years ago, Ms. Mieles said that the busts and buttocks of her family\u2019s mannequins had grown gradually to keep up with the trends in plastic surgery.\n\nNow they have reached a shape that her husband, Trino Colmenarez, 32, calls \u201cestramb\u00f3tico,\u201d a word that may be best translated as \u201cextravagant.\u201d\n\nSales are good, and Ms. Mieles said that she and her husband had started saving money so that she could get breast implants herself. An operation at a private clinic can cost about $6,350, Ms. Mieles said, an amount equivalent to about three months of basic expenses for her household, including food, utilities and other living costs.\n\nThe goal is to look more like the artificial ideal projected by her family\u2019s mannequins.\n\n\u201cBeauty is perfection, to try to perfect yourself more and more every day,\u201d Ms. Mieles said. \u201cThat\u2019s how people see it here.\u201d\n\nMar\u00eda Eugenia D\u00edaz, Paula Ram\u00f3n and Jimmy Chalk contributed reporting from Caracas, Venezuela.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2013/11/07nyt-busty-acropHF.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}, "description": "A culture that emphasizes beauty has led to mannequins that exaggerate the feminine form"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdefc1\"", "article_summary": "The little data available indicates that Venezuelan women do not get plastic surgery more than their counterparts in many other countries.\nThe embrace of plastic surgery clashes with the government\u2019s socialist ideology and frequent talk of creating a society free of the taint of commercialism.\nWhile Ms. Corro\u2019s mannequins took a quantum leap in body shape several years ago, Ms. Mieles said that the busts and buttocks of her family\u2019s mannequins had grown gradually to keep up with the trends in plastic surgery.\nSeveral women\u2019s groups protested against the Miss Venezuela beauty pageant last month, criticizing pressures on women to conform to the artificial aesthetic.\n\u201cThese are the princesses,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause they have the best bust.\u201d\u201cI have lots of clients that come here and say, \u2018I want to look like that mannequin,\u2019 \u201d Ms. Molina said."}
