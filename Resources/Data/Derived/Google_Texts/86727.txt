The husband of an NYPD officer killed during the September 11th attacks returned his wife's

posthumous "Woman of the Year" award to Glamour magazine, after it honored Caitlyn Jenner for the same award this year.

Moira Smith, the only female officer that died in the 9/11 attacks, had given her life to help others survive one of the greatest U.S. tragedies in decades.

For her bravery, Glamour had awarded her their greatest accolade— Woman of the Year.

NYPD officer James Smith posted a letter to the editors of the magazine on Facebook, saying in 2001 he was honored to accept the award on behalf of his wife Moira.

But writes he was "shocked and saddened" to hear that this year, Caitlyn Jenner was named one of the honorees.

He wrote in part, "I find it insulting to Moira Smith's memory, and the memory of other heroic women who have earned this award. Was there no woman in America, or the rest of the world, more deserving than this man."

A spokesman for the magazine told The New York Post that it received Smith’s letter and that it stands by its honors.

Calling it a slap in the face to his family, Smith sent his wife's award back to the magazine.
