The new generation of policies have higher deductibles. Consumers have to pay more of their own money before insurance kicks in. The average deductible for the lowest level of insurance on HealthCare.gov is more than $5,000.\u201d\n\nScism and Martin detailed how the report from HealthPocket Inc., \u201ca company that compares health-insurance plans for consumers,\u201d analyzed the health care plans in 34 out of the 36 states that haven\u2019t set up their own exchanges under the controversial health care law. The report also underlined that the $5081 average cost is \u201c42% higher than the average deductible of $3,589 for an individually purchased plan in 2013 before much of the federal law took effect.\u201d\n\nThe Wall Street Journal correspondents also noted how \u201c\u2018cost-sharing\u2019 subsidies to help pay deductibles are available to people who earn up to 2.5 times the poverty level\u2026.[but] the cost-sharing subsidies for deductibles don\u2019t apply to the bronze policies.\u201d\n\nSix days earlier, the December 3, 2013, edition of CBS This Morning also underlined the continuing problems with the ObamaCare website, even after the White House claimed \u201cit met its deadline to make HealthCare.gov work smoothly for the vast majority of shoppers.\u201d By contrast, NBC\u2019s Today that same morning ballyhooed the supposed positive news about the online health insurance clearinghouse.\n\nEditor\u2019s note.
