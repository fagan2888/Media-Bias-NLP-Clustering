Deveau-Running\u2019s family and the church she works for have participated in the festival\u2019s main parade \u2014 scheduled for Sunday morning \u2014 many times.\n\nDeveau-Running said her girl knows that when parade time comes, she gets to wear a tutu.\n\nThe kids\u2019 parade began at noon in front of the main stage at Civic Center park. Participants walked through and around the park and ended up at the event\u2019s family-fun center.\n\nOn Saturday morning, the \u201cBig Gay 5K\u201d kicked off the annual two-day festival with three times as many participants as last year\u2019s.\n\nThe rest of the day was dedicated to families.\n\n\u201cToday is about having fun with all families,\u201d said Rex Fuller of the GLBT center. \u201cBut especially those in the GLBT community.\u201d\n\nDenver PrideFest, which has been going on for 39 years, says it is the third-largest free-admission such festival in the country. Organizers expect attendance for the weekend to reach 325,000 people.\n\nFuller said this year\u2019s festival has 30 sponsors, the most ever. The festival also sold out its 250 vendor booths 10 days earlier than last year\u2019s.\n\nThe CoorsLight PrideFest Parade \u2014 which organizers call the seventh-largest such parade in the U.S. \u2014 begins at Cheesman Park at 9:30 a.m. Sunday and ends at Civic Center.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Kid\u2019s parade at Denver Pride Fest celebrates family and GLBT pride", "title": "Kid\u2019s parade at Denver Pride Fest celebrates family and GLBT pride", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/06/21/kids-parade-at-denver-pride-fest-celebrates-family-and-glbt-pride/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140621__kidpridep1.jpg", "height": 490}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140621__kidpridep1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-21T14:12:27+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T10:32:12+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0c97\"", "article_summary": "The kids\u2019 parade has been going on for at least five years, and this year, Frontier Airlines has joined as a sponsor.\nThe kids\u2019 parade began at noon in front of the main stage at Civic Center park.\nLulofs gave credit to the Frontier and festival volunteers for making the family center and kids\u2019 parade happen.\nSarah Deveau-Running said Saturday\u2019s parade marked her 2\u00bd-year-old daughter\u2019s first time in the event.\nThe CoorsLight PrideFest Parade \u2014 which organizers call the seventh-largest such parade in the U.S. \u2014 begins at Cheesman Park at 9:30 a.m. Sunday and ends at Civic Center."}
