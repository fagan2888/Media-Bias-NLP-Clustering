The issue has taken on particular importance in Connecticut, where an onerous state hospital tax and cutbacks in Medicaid reimbursements have adversely impacted hospitals throughout the state.\n\nAs members of the Board of Directors for Stamford Hospital, we recognize the importance of patient care and safety. Over the last few weeks, the Hospital has been recognized by both The Leapfrog Group and The Joint Commission for its efforts in this area.\n\nEarlier this month, Stamford Hospital earned an \u201cA\u201d rating for patient safety \u2014 one of only four hospitals in Connecticut to receive Leapfrog\u2019s top grade. Most recently, The Joint Commission named Stamford Hospital a Top Performer for the second straight year. The hospital joins an elite group of only 9% of Joint Commission-accredited hospitals across the U.S. recognized for attaining and sustaining excellence in six or more areas. Stamford was one of only three hospitals in Connecticut to receive recognition in six areas, namely heart attack, heart failure, perinatal care, pneumonia, stroke and surgical care.\n\nWe are fortunate to live in a community served by a hospital recognized for delivering the highest standards of patient safety and quality, a distinction that reflects the standards and quality of life enjoyed in New Canaan. The initiatives introduced by the medical staff and clinical leadership \u2014 from the latest in surgical protocols to strict infection control measures \u2014 complement the personalized care provided by each and every member of the staff.\n\nWe believe these distinctions are a testament to Stamford Hospital\u2019s ongoing commitment to provide the best possible patient experience and are proud to share these accomplishments with our community. We are proud to be part of this evolution in care in Fairfield County and know that when the new hospital opens its doors next fall, these extraordinary efforts will only be magnified.\n\nMark DeWaele, DMD\n\nHelen Jaffe\n\nDavid Jahns\n\nBoard members\n\nStamford Hospital", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "New Canaan Advertiser", "description": "A letter about Stamford Hospital being recognized for quality and safety.", "title": "Stamford Hospital recognized for quality and safety", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://ncadvertiser.hanewsmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/29/2015/06/Editorial-Resized-150x150.png", "updated_time": "2015-12-04T09:34:16+00:00", "url": "http://ncadvertiser.com/63723/stamford-hospital-recognized-for-quality-and-safety/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NCAdvertiser", "section": "Editorial", "tag": "stamford hospital", "published_time": "2015-12-04T09:30:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-04T09:34:16+00:00"}, "twitter": {"domain": "New Canaan Advertiser", "description": "A letter about Stamford Hospital being recognized for quality and safety.", "creator": "@ncadvertiser", "image": {"src": "http://ncadvertiser.hanewsmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/29/2015/06/Editorial-Resized.png"}, "title": "Stamford Hospital recognized for quality and safety", "site": "@ncadvertiser", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "A letter about Stamford Hospital being recognized for quality and safety."}, "article_summary": "As members of the Board of Directors for Stamford Hospital, we recognize the importance of patient care and safety.\nWe are fortunate to live in a community served by a hospital recognized for delivering the highest standards of patient safety and quality, a distinction that reflects the standards and quality of life enjoyed in New Canaan.\nEarlier this month, Stamford Hospital earned an \u201cA\u201d rating for patient safety \u2014 one of only four hospitals in Connecticut to receive Leapfrog\u2019s top grade.\nMost recently, The Joint Commission named Stamford Hospital a Top Performer for the second straight year.\nOver the last few weeks, the Hospital has been recognized by both The Leapfrog Group and The Joint Commission for its efforts in this area."}
