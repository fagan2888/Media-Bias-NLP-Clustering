The Hawaii Legislature and the city of Healdsburg have passed similar legislation. A companion California law would mandate that e-cigarettes fall under the same restrictions as tobacco smokes.\n\nIf the laws pass, 18 will make a Californian old enough to vote, to enlist in the military, to sign a contract, to buy a gun, to get a tattoo and to get married \u2014 but not old enough to buy a cigarette. Not for three years.\n\nIt\u2019s also not old enough to drink.\n\nI am old enough to remember the mantra: \u201cOld enough to fight, old enough to vote.\u201d In 1971, responding to a system that allowed 18-year-olds to enlist in the military without letting them vote for who runs it, states ratified the 26th Amendment, which lowered the voting from age 21 to 18.\n\nThe companion slogan: \u201cOld enough to fight, old enough to drink.\u201d Ergo the 18-year-old drinking age in many states. Washington responded with the National Minimum Drinking Age Act of 1984 \u2014 which withheld a chunk of federal transportation funding from states with drinking ages below 21. Here conservatives must take the blame, as President Ronald Reagan signed the bill, passed by a Democratic House and GOP Senate, which effectively tells states what to do. This set a pattern for dual ages of adulthood.\n\nI\u2019ve written before against the 21-year-old drinking age. It doesn\u2019t stop college kids from drinking \u2014 we know that. And I don\u2019t think Washington has a right to tell a 19-year-old who works for a living that he or she is really a child and cannot make adult decisions. But when you ask a politician about lowering the drinking age to 18, they are not sure how to respond.\n\nThe issue has become one of those boutique conservative causes. University of Tennessee law Professor Glenn Harlan Reynolds has advocated for it. In 2011, Reynolds wrote in the Wall Street Journal, \u201cIn fact, 18-year-olds in America are old enough to do pretty much everything except drink.\u201d Now he would have to add except consume marijuana, as even in the four states that have legalized recreational use of marijuana \u2014 Colorado, Washington, Oregon and Alaska \u2014 the legal age is 21.\n\nAt the same time, a California 14-year-old needs neither parental approval nor parental consent to have an abortion.\n\nIn nanny-city San Francisco, Supervisor John Avalos has proposed lowering the voting age to 16 in some elections. When I asked Avalos if, in that spirit, he thought the city should lower the legal age for smoking, he answered that passing a law to give a teenager the vote is \u201cvery different from saying someone is adult.\u201d No lie: That teen won\u2019t be able to buy a beer for five years.\n\nThe final stage of adulthood? The Democrats\u2019 2010 Affordable Care Act mandates that health plans provide coverage for parents\u2019 adult children up to age 26. It was a popular provision with parents whose college-graduate children could not get a job with health benefits. But then, to the nanny-state left, with its proposals to squeeze soda drinking, and ban single-use plastic bags and smoking (other than medical marijuana), we are all children, regardless of age.", "article_metadata": {"SKYPE_TOOLBAR": "SKYPE_TOOLBAR_PARSER_COMPATIBLE", "sailthru.author": "By Debra J.
