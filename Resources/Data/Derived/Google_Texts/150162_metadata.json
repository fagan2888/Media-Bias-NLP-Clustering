Shaw called him the most athletic player on the team.\n\n\u201cI definitely look at it as a good opportunity,\u201d Barton said. \u201cIt\u2019s just about jelling, getting chemistry and putting things together and go out there and competing. Hopefully, we play together and get some wins.\u201d\n\nIt didn\u2019t take long for Barton to show off his athleticism with an emphatic dunk in the second quarter.\n\nLauvergne signed as a free agent Wednesday and scored his first NBA points with 7:42 left in the first half on free throws.\n\nNuggets waive Claver, Robinson\n\nTwo pieces of Thursday\u2019s trade with Portland were officially waived before Sunday\u2019s game.\n\nForwards Victor Claver and Thomas Robinson were let go, the Nuggets announced in a release.\n\nThey were acquired alongside Barton and a lottery-protected 2016 first-round draft pick from Portland in exchange for Arron Afflalo and Alonzo Gee.\n\nLawson returns after suspension\n\nNuggets point guard Ty Lawson returned from his one-game suspension, and Shaw was hoping his return would boost the offense.\n\n\u201cWell I think we saw the other night in Milwaukee, we couldn\u2019t get any penetration, couldn\u2019t get in the paint at all and we had to settle for taking a lot of 3s,\u201d Shaw said. \u201cSo, having him back definitely increases our ability to get out in transition a little more and be able to get in the paint.\u201d\n\nLawson was suspended from Friday\u2019s game due to an unexcused absence from practice.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Denver Nuggets ready to play newcomers Will Barton, Joffrey Lauvergne", "title": "Denver Nuggets ready to play newcomers Will Barton, Joffrey Lauvergne", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/02/22/denver-nuggets-ready-to-play-newcomers-will-barton-joffrey-lauvergne/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150203__Joffrey-Lauvergnep1.jpg", "height": 417}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150203__Joffrey-Lauvergnep1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-02-22T18:26:12+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-24T20:23:47+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Nuggets waive Claver, RobinsonTwo pieces of Thursday\u2019s trade with Portland were officially waived before Sunday\u2019s game.\nAnd that includes new additions Will Barton and Joffrey Lauvergne.\nThey were acquired alongside Barton and a lottery-protected 2016 first-round draft pick from Portland in exchange for Arron Afflalo and Alonzo Gee.\nOKLAHOMA CITY \u2014 Nuggets coach Brian Shaw admitted before Sunday\u2019s game against the Oklahoma City Thunder that it was time to start seeing other players on the floor.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been trying to think about how I\u2019m going to do the rotation,\u201d Shaw said."}
