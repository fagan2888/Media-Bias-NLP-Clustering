WASHINGTON (CBSDC) — The least popular Congress in recent history is also the least productive, according to the Pew Research Center.

It analyzed the legislative output of the 113th Congress and found it passed a mere 55 substantive bills (and an additional 10 bills that do things like rename post offices).

The previous Congress passed 63 substantive measures by the end of its first year.

By comparison, the 80th Congress, blasted by President Truman as the “do-nothing Congress,” passed 395 bills by the end of 1947, its first year.

Lawmakers were unable to send the president a farm bill, immigration legislation or any appropriations bills and a bitter fight over funding Obamacare led to a shutdown of the federal government.

They did pass an aid package for Superstorm Sandy victims, renew the Violence Against Women Act and reach a deal on student loan rates.

Congress’ disapproval rating reached a record high in November, according to a CBS News poll.
