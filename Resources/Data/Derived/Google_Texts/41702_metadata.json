He returned in late May and has won three consecutive Sprint Cup Series races and four of the last five.\n\n\u201cThis has been a phenomenal return,\u201d Busch said. \u201cI won\u2019t say phenomenal year because it was a dismal year to start, but I guess I\u2019ll take that 11-week vacation any year if it\u2019s going to look like this.\u201d\n\nNow he has a prestigious Brickyard victory to give him one of NASCAR\u2019s elusive crown jewels. His Indianapolis victory ranks alongside his Southern 500 win at Darlington Raceway as the biggest of his career.\n\n\u201cMaybe I found my happy place,\u201d Busch said in victory lane when asked if he has found a new perspective since he was injured in a crash the day before the season-opening Daytona. 500.\n\nBusch, who also won the second-tier Xfinity Series race Saturday at Indianapolis, moved 23 points away from cracking the top 30 in the standings. NASCAR granted him a waiver that will make him eligible for the Chase for the Sprint Cup championship should he be ranked inside the top 30 in points.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a championship contending team, we just need to be championship eligible,\u201d Busch said.\n\nThe win for Joe Gibbs Racing was the first Sprint Cup Series victory at Indianapolis for Toyota, which has now won at all 23 active tracks.\n\nChevrolet had entered the race on a 12-year winning streak and had won the race 16 of 21 times. The manufacturer also won the Indianapolis 500 in May with Roger Penske driver Juan Pablo Montoya.\n\nBut Penske was denied his first Brickyard 400 win when Joey Logano finished second to Busch on Sunday in a Ford.\n\n\u201cGeez, I guess Kyle\u2019s back,\u201d Daytona 500 winner Logano said. \u201cIt\u2019s just so frustrating running second at the Brickyard. Second hurts.\u201d\n\nBusch knows that all too well. He finished second in two of the previous three Brickyards.\n\nKevin Harvick was third in a Chevrolet, followed by Martin Truex Jr., Busch teammate Denny Hamlin and Clint Bowyer. Matt Kenseth, another Gibbs driver, was seventh, followed by Kurt Busch and Kyle Larson.\n\nPenske driver Brad Keselowski rounded out the top 10.\n\nJeff Gordon\u2019s final Brickyard 400 was a huge bust as an early spin caused considerable damage that eventually sent him to the garage for repairs. Gordon, who has a record five victories at Indianapolis, finished 42nd. He\u2019s retiring at the end of the year.\n\nStory Continues \u2192", "article_metadata": {"description": "Busch won the Brickyard 400 at Indianapolis Motor Speedway, marking a weekend sweep, his third consecutive Sprint Cup victory and his fourth victory in the series in his last five races.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Busch won the Brickyard 400 at Indianapolis Motor Speedway, marking a weekend sweep, his third consecutive Sprint Cup victory and his fourth victory in the series in his last five races.", "title": "Kyle Busch grabs elusive Indianapolis victory as comeback run continues", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jul/26/kyle-busch-grabs-elusive-indianapolis-victory/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/07/26/AP_697579488976.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/07/26/AP_697579488976.jpg", "description": "Busch won the Brickyard 400 at Indianapolis Motor Speedway, marking a weekend sweep, his third consecutive Sprint Cup victory and his fourth victory in the series in his last five races.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Kyle Busch grabs elusive Indianapolis victory as comeback run continue"}, "Author": "Jenna Fryer", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Kyle Busch, Indianapolis, Nascar, Joey Logano"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc907\"", "article_summary": "INDIANAPOLIS \u2014 Kyle Busch\u2019s incredible comeback rolled through Indianapolis Motor Speedway, where Busch won the Brickyard 400 on Sunday for a weekend sweep at the historic track.\nHis Indianapolis victory ranks alongside his Southern 500 win at Darlington Raceway as the biggest of his career.\nBusch, who also won the second-tier Xfinity Series race Saturday at Indianapolis, moved 23 points away from cracking the top 30 in the standings.\nThe win for Joe Gibbs Racing was the first Sprint Cup Series victory at Indianapolis for Toyota, which has now won at all 23 active tracks.\nHe returned in late May and has won three consecutive Sprint Cup Series races and four of the last five."}
