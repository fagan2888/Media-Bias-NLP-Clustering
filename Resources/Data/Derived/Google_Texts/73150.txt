Spring may have gotten off to a cooler-than-average start Sunday, but the chilly weather won’t be sticking around.

The first official day of spring started with near-freezing temperatures and topped out at 57, about 12 degrees below average, said meteorologist Lamont Bain with the National Weather Service.

After another cool night and morning, more seasonal weather is expected Monday, when forecasters predict a high of 67.

The warming trend will continue Tuesday and Wednesday, but a front Wednesday evening will bring with it a 40 percent chance of storms.

Storms late Wednesday and Thursday have the potential to be severe, but, for now, they are expected to stay east and north of the Dallas-Fort Worth area, Bain said.

Though it’s still days away, Easter weekend should be pleasant, with highs around 70 and lows around 50.

“Not too shabby for any type of outdoor activities,” Bain said.

Here’s what forecasters at KXAS-TV (NBC5) say to expect this week:

Monday: High 67/Low 37

Tuesday: High 77/Low 51

Wednesday: High 82 /Low 63

Thursday: High 62/Low 52

Friday: High 64/Low 40
