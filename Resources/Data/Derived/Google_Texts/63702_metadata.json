But the game was not an audition for Pickard to stay in the NHL, Roy said.\n\n\u201cNo. Zero,\u201d Roy said. \u201cIf he had a shutout or a bad game, it would have nothing to do with it. And I didn\u2019t think he had a bad game. I thought he played well. It\u2019s just the situation we\u2019re in.\u201d\n\nThe Avs will lean on No. 1 goalie Semyon Varlamov almost exclusively.\n\nRoy said he told Pickard to prepare for a possible call-up in the middle of January, when the Avs play on back-to-back nights at Washington and at Carolina, on Jan. 12 and 13.\n\n\u201cVarly is 100 percent. And we\u2019re going to play him a lot. Period,\u201d Roy said.\n\nPickard, who is 6-6-2 in net with a team-leading 2.21 goals-against average and a .934 save percentage, started the season in the American Hockey League, and has been called up to the Avs three times.\n\nVarlamov, who last week returned from a groin injury, has played about 50 percent of the season. He\u2019s 5-6-5 with a 3.01 GAA and .913 save percentage.\n\nSecond-year backup Reto Berra remains with the Avs as Varlamov\u2019s emergency relief.\n\nThe Avs also dropped first-year forward Dennis Everberg to the American Hockey League Sunday. Defenseman Nick Holden will take Everberg\u2019s place as a fourth-line forward Monday in a game against the Blues in St. Louis.The Avs will field a roster with only 20 players, Roy said.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Avs\u2019 Patrick Roy sends Calvin Pickard back to Lake Erie", "title": "Avs\u2019 Patrick Roy sends Calvin Pickard back to Lake Erie", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/12/28/avs-patrick-roy-sends-calvin-pickard-back-to-lake-erie/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141221__avs-pickardp1.jpg", "height": 455}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141221__avs-pickardp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-28T15:36:09+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T03:19:11+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce99b\"", "article_summary": "\u201cHe needs to see a lot of action,\u201d Colorado coach Patrick Roy said of Pickard, who was sent back to play for the Lake Erie Monsters of the American Hockey League.\nThe Avs also dropped first-year forward Dennis Everberg to the American Hockey League Sunday.\nPickard on Saturday allowed four goals in the Avs\u2019 5-2 loss to the Chicago Blackhawks in Denver.\nBut the game was not an audition for Pickard to stay in the NHL, Roy said.\nRoy said he told Pickard to prepare for a possible call-up in the middle of January, when the Avs play on back-to-back nights at Washington and at Carolina, on Jan. 12 and 13."}
