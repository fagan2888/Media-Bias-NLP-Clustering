But when he told one of his teachers he needed to go to the bathroom every 10 minutes, she rightly told him he should be checked for diabetes. Frequent urination is a classic warning sign.\n\nWhen the doctors tested Star\u2019s blood glucose level, it was 1,300 mg/dL \u2013 dangerously high considering that even in people with diabetes the goal is to keep blood glucose levels between about 100 and 150 mg/dL.\n\n\u201cThe doctors wondered why I wasn\u2019t in a coma,\u201d says Star, who is now a 29-year-old recording artist/songwriter living in Florida. \u201cThat was the beginning of my journey as a type 1 diabetic.\u201d\n\nHe started taking better care of his health, which includes eating right, as well as taking insulin and checking his blood glucose levels multiple times a day, a regimen that can get expensive. He was covered under his father\u2019s insurance plan until he turned 26 \u2013 when he suddenly found himself without health insurance he could afford.\n\n\u201cThe COBRA plan I was on shot up from $120 a month to $512 a month for the exact same plan, a cost that was not do-able for me,\u201d Star says. Fortunately, the Obamacare marketplace opened up soon after and he enrolled in a new plan.\n\n\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for Obamacare, I don\u2019t know how I\u2019d be capable of taking care of myself,\u201d Star says. \u201cEven if I had a lot of money, before Obamacare they could still decline me because I have a pre-existing condition.\u201d\n\nStar signed up for a plan with better coverage and more personal attention than he received from his previous plan. His premiums are around $150 a month and he doesn\u2019t pay anything extra for his insulin pump or continuous blood glucose monitor \u2013 diabetes management options his previous provider never even told him about.\n\nLower costs, better-quality care\n\nAn insulin pump is a device that delivers insulin automatically if blood glucose levels climb, and the monitor continuously checks blood glucose levels. Type 1 diabetes can be challenging to control because the body isn\u2019t making enough \u2013 or any \u2013 insulin on its own, so tools like these can make a big difference. (In people with type 2 diabetes, the body still produces insulin but isn\u2019t using it effectively.)\n\nStar\u2019s insurance plan also includes a diabetes management program that gives him access to a team of doctors, nurses and other healthcare experts who help him stay healthy. This is another benefit of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which requires every insurance plan to offer management of chronic diseases like diabetes.\n\nUnder his plan, Star\u2019s health advisor calls him every month to see if he needs anything between visits with his specialist \u2013 a team approach he appreciates.\n\n\u201cMy team is a lot stronger now,\u201d says Star. \u201cYou can know everything about diabetes, but no man is an island. I now have a team I can reach out to any time that is strong in places where I am not.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s paying it forward, too. As he pursues his music career, Star is determined to set an example for others living with type 1 diabetes. In fact, he included a scene highlighting his diabetes management in a music video.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a recording artist on tour and I happen to have type 1 diabetes,\u201d Star says. \u201cIf I can lead by example and encourage someone else to live comfortably, then I\u2019ve done my job.\u201d\n\nInsurance that helps manage and prevent disease\n\nStar\u2019s experience is shared by millions of Americans with diabetes who now have access to better care thanks to the ACA.\n\nThere\u2019s good evidence that chronic disease management works \u2013 and that the ACA is already making a difference in that regard. According to a study published in 2015 and led by researchers at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, people with health insurance are more likely to have their high cholesterol, diabetes and high blood pressure correctly diagnosed, and to have these chronic conditions under control, than similar uninsured people. Looking at these results and 10-year ACA enrollment projections, \u201cThese effects constitute a major positive outcome from the ACA,\u201d according to study senior author Joshua Salomon.\n\nThe majority of people with diabetes have type 2 diabetes, which can often be prevented or delayed. Obamacare is helping those people, too.\n\nAccording to Hector De La Torre, executive director of the Transamerica Center for Health Studies, more than 29 million Americans have diabetes \u2013 but one in four who have the condition don\u2019t know it.\n\n\n\n\u201cHaving access to care will help to diagnose those folks so they can start taking better care of themselves,\u201d he says.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, 86 million American adults \u2013 more than one in three \u2013 have pre-diabetes, De La Torre says. Pre-diabetes is a condition in which blood glucose levels are higher than normal, but not high enough to be considered type 2 diabetes yet. Studies have shown that moderate weight loss and increases in physical activity can prevent or delay the development of type 2 diabetes in people with pre-diabetes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a ticking time bomb of a chronic condition,\u201d De La Torre says. \u201cBetween 15 and 30 percent of people with pre-diabetes will develop type 2 diabetes within five years unless they\u2019re diagnosed and start taking care of it under the guidance of a physician.\u201d\n\nA diagnosis is key to preventing type 2 diabetes, which means regular check-ups \u2013 which the ACA requires insurers to cover once a year at no extra cost. And for those who already have type 1 or type 2 diabetes, the appropriate care can prevent serious long-term complications including kidney disease, heart disease, blindness or amputation.\n\nEconomic support for proven care models\n\nAccess to care is important. But so is care coordination and continuity of care, which means establishing a relationship with a healthcare team and seeing them regularly, like Star does. This is vitally important for people with chronic conditions \u2013 something healthcare experts have been advocating for years.\n\n\u201cAcademic research around care coordination proves that you get much better outcomes, and care coordination is being pushed in part by the ACA,\u201d De La Torre says. \u201cThat\u2019s where healthcare was headed anyway, so it\u2019s wonderful to see those economic incentives aligned and those care coordination teams supported.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, a provision of the ACA created a National Diabetes Prevention Program (NDPP), which brings evidence-based lifestyle change programs to local communities. Led by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), NDPP initiatives are available across the country and online to help prevent or delay the development of type 2 diabetes.\n\nBy every measure, people with diabetes \u2013 and those at risk \u2013 have significantly improved access to quality care than they did before the ACA.\n\n\u201cI have a better healthcare team and more consistent care,\u201d Star says. \u201cThere is no question that as a type 1 diabetic, my life has been positively impacted by the ACA.\u201d\n\nRemember: Open enrollment for 2016 ends January 31, 2016, so if you haven\u2019t signed up for coverage yet there\u2019s no time to waste.", "article_metadata": {"description": "By every measure, people with diabetes \u2013 and those at risk \u2013 have significantly improved access to quality care than they did before the ACA.", "og": {"site_name": "Health Insurance Resource Center", "description": "By every measure, people with diabetes \u2013 and those at risk \u2013 have significantly improved access to quality care than they did before the ACA.", "title": "Life with diabetes is sweeter thanks to Obamacare", "url": "https://www.healthinsurance.org/blog/2016/01/20/life-with-diabetes-is-sweeter-thanks-to-obamacare/", "image": "https://www.healthinsurance.org/assets/2016/01/Obamacare-diabetes-coverage-1560x816.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1007310172}, "keywords": "chronic conditions, COBRA, diabetes, health insurance marketplace, pre-existing condition", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-20T09:09:54+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3786\"", "article_summary": "Lower costs, better-quality careAn insulin pump is a device that delivers insulin automatically if blood glucose levels climb, and the monitor continuously checks blood glucose levels.\nThe majority of people with diabetes have type 2 diabetes, which can often be prevented or delayed.\n\u201cI\u2019m a recording artist on tour and I happen to have type 1 diabetes,\u201d Star says.\nWhen the doctors tested Star\u2019s blood glucose level, it was 1,300 mg/dL \u2013 dangerously high considering that even in people with diabetes the goal is to keep blood glucose levels between about 100 and 150 mg/dL.\nPre-diabetes is a condition in which blood glucose levels are higher than normal, but not high enough to be considered type 2 diabetes yet."}
