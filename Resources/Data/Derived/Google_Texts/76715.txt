Not only has Jana Mashonee, Lumbee, been nominated for two GRAMMYs, and won nine NAMMYs, she is dedicated to helping Native youth.

Her Jana’s Kids Foundation raises funds to offer scholarships to American Indian and Aboriginal youth for academic, artistic, and athletic achievement, what Mashonee calls the Triple “A” scholarships.

According to the foundation’s website, Jana’s Native Youth Motivational Presentation has become the most successful presentation of its kind in the country. She blends music, dance, and motivational speaking in order to reach young people.

“My goal is to encourage Native youth in a positive way through my words and music, and to promote higher education,” Mashonee says in a video for the foundation.

The deadline to apply for a Jana’s Kids scholarship is August 15. There are three opportunities available, students can apply for a scholarship in one of the Triple “A” areas. Visit JanasKids.org to apply.
