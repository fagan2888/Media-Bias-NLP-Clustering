Orlando, Florida-based graphic designer, Gary Sterley, wowed fellow Warhammer fans last year with his Warhammer 40k Space Marine costume built for wearing for both Halloween and cosplay conventions (cons). He used PVC and foam for most of the costume (and built stilts in to the shoes), but knew he needed something very special for the most distinctive part of the costume: the character\u2019s \u201cPower Fist.\u201d Gary augmented the costume by creating a 3D printed Power Fist. His step-by-step process is available on his Instructables website.\n\nFor those readers unfamiliar with Warhammer 40k \u2014 the game\u2019s full title is Warhammer 40,000, \u2014 here\u2019s a quick summary: Warhammer 40k is a traditional, board-oriented RPG, made by Games Workshop. It\u2019s the futuristic version of its predecessor, Warhammer Fantasy Battle, set in a dystopian sci-fi future. In this forty-first millennium, war-torn universe, various races and factions of humans are the oppressed masses of an interstellar empire ruled by the tyrannical Eldar, the Orks ,and the Daemons. Powerful warriors \u2014 including the genetically modified, superhuman Space Marines \u2014 defend humanity from these tyrants. One of the most formidable Space Marine chapters is the Crimson Fists. Their armor is predominantly blue but the right hand is distinguished by its intimidating \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 Crimson Fist.\n\nSterley wanted a Crimson Fist that in appearance remained faithful to the game models but he also wanted something more complex than other cosplayers\u2019 foam versions (like Henrik Pilerud, who inspired much of Sterley\u2019s build process). He had also received a Christmas gift from his wife that inspired his creative process: a Solidoodle2 3D printer. Sterley\u2019s primary goals were to create a finished piece wherein all of the fingers could articulate in a realistic way and the various components could be connected without the hardware showing, all while remaining as faithful as possible to the appearance of the game\u2019s models. 3D printing the parts would enable him to create the articulate piece he imagined.\n\nThe graphic designer had little previous experience with 3D modeling but taught himself to create a satisfactory model, transferring his 2D sketches into 3D via Google Sketchup. Sterley admitted that the 3D modeling process took longer than he hoped, but he eventually created a model that achieved his goals. His design, which fe atured individual fingers with three segments each, all snapped together without the need for hardware. He used elastic bands inside of the structure, which were held in place by rings. Strings allowed him to control the movement of the fingers, which curl over and fold inward to make a fist \u2014 a Crimson Fist.\n\nSterley sent his final .STL file to his Solidoodle2 3D printer. His first round of printing proved less successful than he hoped. The problem was with the overall size of Sterley\u2019s Power Fist, which really evokes the exaggerated graphics of comic books and video games. Not content to scale down the piece, Sterley made a number of adjustments to the design, including adding four segments to each finger and rethinking the hardware. The end result is a large \u2014 approximately the size of its wearer\u2019s torso \u2014 multi-component Power Fist, complete with a winged skull and the word \u201cMORTEM\u201d emblazoned on the top of the hand.\n\nWhile the Crimson Fist consists primarily of 3D printed pieces, Sterley also applied his graphic and handcrafting skills to create the finished piece. His Instructables site includes photographs and a demo video of his project.\n\nThe final costume has made quite a splash at the many conventions and public events to which Sterley has worn it.
