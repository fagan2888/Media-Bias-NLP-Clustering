This, they say, biases responses in favor of \u201cfix,\u201d because people like fixing things, and at any rate, Obamacare can\u2019t be fixed by definition.\n\nSo this new Bloomberg News poll will pose an additional problem to those who simply refuse to accept the reality that, while disapproval of the law remains high, the American people still want to stick with it:\n\nWhat is your opinion of the health care law? It should be repealed: 32 It may need small modifications, but we should see how it works: 56 It should be left alone: 10\n\nSo 66 percent support giving the law a chance to work with possible small modifications or leaving it alone, versus only 32 percent who want it done away with. This seems like fair wording.\n\nMeanwhile, the poll also finds that 39 percent support the law, while 11 percent oppose it because it did not go far enough \u2014 a total of 51 percent, versus 42 percent who oppose the law because it went too far. Some have raised legitimate questions about the validity of this particular line of questioning. But taken together, all these numbers seem to support the idea that the electorate remains polarized around whether to approve or disapprove of the law, while clearly supporting keeping it in place.\n\nMeanwhile, there is broad support for the law\u2019s individual provisions. Sixty-five percent support banning insurance industry discrimination against preexisting conditions; 55 percent support eliminating lifetime caps on insurance company payouts for health care; and 75 percent support allowing children up to 26 to stay on parents\u2019 policies. As always, the mandate is unpopular, but even here it\u2019s not too bad, at 46-52. (This is only one poll, but its general findings on repeal and the popularity of the law\u2019s provisions have been confirmed in polling for years now.)\n\nOf course, this is national polling, so it doesn\u2019t go to the state of opinion on the law in red states, where battle for control of the Senate will be decided. And there the law will probably remain a weight on vulnerable Dems. But even in the contested Senate races, there are signs GOP candidates no longer see public opinion on the law in the simplistic terms that national Republican operatives \u2014 and their friends in the press \u2014 have spun out. Multiple GOP Senate candidates are mouthing support for the law\u2019s general goals and are refusing to take a position on the Medicaid expansion \u2014 things they would not have to do if the law were nothing but a slam-dunk certain winner for Republicans.\n\nMore broadly, these national numbers are the latest sign that Republicans are not winning the general argument over the law, even if Democrats aren\u2019t winning it either. And they once again undercut the notion that Obamacare is the long term political disaster and unequivocal repudiation of liberal governance Republicans claim it is.\n\n*********************************************************************\n\nUPDATE: One additional key finding from the new Bloomberg poll:\n\nDoes a candidate\u2019s support for the law make you more likely or less likely to vote for the candidate? More likely: 38 Less likely: 39 Wouldn\u2019t matter: 19\n\nYes, I know, this is probably different in red states, and intensity is on the side of opponents. Still, this again raises the possibility that the law\u2019s political impact could prove overstated.\n\n***************************************************************\n\n* ELECTORATE MORE POLARIZED THAN EVER? There\u2019s a lot of chatter this morning about Pew\u2019s big new study documenting high levels of polarization in our politics. This is the key finding:\n\nRepublicans and Democrats are more divided along ideological lines \u2013 and partisan antipathy is deeper and more extensive \u2013 than at any point in the last two decades. These trends manifest themselves in myriad ways, both in politics and in everyday life\u2026.ideological thinking is now much more closely aligned with partisanship than in the past. As a result, ideological overlap between the two parties has diminished: Today, 92% of Republicans are to the right of the median Democrat, and 94% of Democrats are to the left of the median Republican.\n\nTime has a good summary of the Pew study in chart form, documenting: \u201cAmericans are becoming either more liberal or conservative.\u201d And: \u201cDemocrats and Republicans more ideologically divided.\u201d And \u201cMore Democrats and Republicans view the other party as a threat to the nation.\u201d\n\nI would point out, however, that on many of the issues themselves, the American people aren\u2019t really all that polarized. Partisanship, it seems, ends up trumping issues.\n\n* ELIZABETH WARREN TO CAMPAIGN FOR ALISON GRIMES: The Massachusetts Senator announces on Chris Hayes\u2019 show that she will campaign in Kentucky, in the wake of the successful Mitch McConnell/GOP filibuster of her bill to provide student loan relief paid for by the Buffett Rule.\n\nHere\u2019s another issue where Grimes will seek to draw a stark econonmic contrast with McConnell, arguing that he is prioritizing protecting the wealth of millionaires and billionaires over helping ordinary Kentuckians. It\u2019s also in keeping with Grimes\u2019 efforts to create a sense of excitement around her candidacy that could perhaps insulate it from the national midterm drop-off problem Dems face.\n\n* GRIMES AHEAD OF McCONNELL? A new Kentucky poll finds Grimes edging McConnell by three, 49-46. However, stick to the polling averages: They show a dead heat.\n\n* MORE GOOD NEWS ABOUT OBAMACARE: Jonathan Cohn brings us a new study showing a roughly 40 percent decline in the number of uninsured people in Minnesota, which help confirm reports of a nationwide drop in the same due to Obamacare. Foes who refuse to acknowledge any good news may crow that much of the drop was due to the expansion of Medicaid, but as Cohn notes, this once again demonstrates just what many Republican states refusing to opt in to the expansion are denying to their own constituents.\n\n* WHAT CANTOR\u2019S LOSS SAYS ABOUT OUR POLITICS: The New York Times has a good piece explaining what the rage of GOP primary voters, as evidenced in David Brat\u2019s victory, will mean for the remainder of the Obama presidency:\n\nThat fury will ensure a gridlocked capital for at least the rest of this year and perhaps for the remainder of Mr. Obama\u2019s presidency. It also raises new doubts about Washington\u2019s ability to conduct the most basic functions of government, suggesting the possibility of another round, or rounds, of brinkmanship on funding the government and measures to keep the country from defaulting on its debt. Should Republicans take control of the Senate and retain the House this November, even these most fundamental acts could prove difficult because of fear among Republican members that any hint of cooperation with the president will encourage a primary challenge.\n\nWell, okay, \u201cWashington\u201d cannot conduct the most basic functions of government, but that\u2019s because today\u2019s GOP has lost the ability to enter into constructive governing. As our next item shows.\n\n* WHAT CANTOR\u2019S LOSS SAYS ABOUT TODAY\u2019S \u2018NIHILIST\u2019 GOP: Norman Ornstein has a terrific column explaining that Eric Cantor\u2019s defeat at the hands of Tea Partyer will only drive the GOP further in the direction of the post-policy nihilism it had already been succumbing to:\n\nIf anything, Cantor\u2019s defeat will make leaders even more gun-shy about moving to real solutions or new approaches. The fact is that, even before Cantor\u2019s defeat, Republican House and Senate leaders had shown no interest in operationalizing a bold or innovative policy agenda. Maybe that is a short-term strategy, based on the belief that success in the midterms ahead will be driven far more by a reaction against the Obama status quo than on a contrast with an alternative agenda\u2026But given the current dynamics of the Republican Party\u2026as it is now constituted, new ideas coming from pointy-headed intellectuals (who will not be viewed as saviors by nihilists) are going to require a whole lot more time to germinate.\n\nRepublicans will win big this fall, thanks to the map, but this inevitability may only encourage the party to put off developing an affirmative agenda that would broaden its appeal to the voter groups that increasingly matter in national elections.\n\n* AND TEA PARTY PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES ENCOURAGED BY BRAT WIN: I\u2019m sure Democratic operatives thinking about 2016 will not mind this all that much:\n\nTea Party-backed senators eyeing White House bids in 2016 are encouraged by the victory of an underfunded challenger to House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, a grandee of the GOP establishment\u2026.Sens. Ted Cruz, Rand Paul and Marco Rubio argued David Brat\u2019s 11-point win showed that conservative principles can triumph over fundraising might and special-interest backing.\n\nThe alternative interpretation, offered by GOP Rep. Pete King, is that if the Brat win empowers the Ted Cruz wing of the party, it could relegate the GOP to \u201cpermanent minority\u201d status in presidential elections.\n\nWhat else?", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new poll finds a sizable majority wants to give the law a chance to work.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/WashingtonPostPlumLine?ref=hl", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "A new poll finds a sizable majority wants to give the law a chance to work.", "title": "Morning Plum: Republicans still not winning argument over Obamacare", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2014/06/12/morning-plum-republicans-still-not-winning-argument-over-obamacare/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/Wires/Images/2014-06-11/AP/Obama-052fc.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@theplumlinegs"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2014/06/12/morning-plum-republicans-still-not-winning-argument-over-obamacare/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "obamacare, affordable care act, david brat, tea party, eric cantor,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/WashingtonPostPlumLine?ref=hl"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "obamacare, affordable care act, david brat, tea party, eric cantor,"}, "article_summary": "More broadly, these national numbers are the latest sign that Republicans are not winning the general argument over the law, even if Democrats aren\u2019t winning it either.\nAnd they once again undercut the notion that Obamacare is the long term political disaster and unequivocal repudiation of liberal governance Republicans claim it is.\nThere\u2019s a lot of chatter this morning about Pew\u2019s big new study documenting high levels of polarization in our politics.\nThis, they say, biases responses in favor of \u201cfix,\u201d because people like fixing things, and at any rate, Obamacare can\u2019t be fixed by definition.\nMeanwhile, there is broad support for the law\u2019s individual provisions."}
