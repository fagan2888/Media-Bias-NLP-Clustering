The boundary crossing often leads to a surprising and paradoxical result. Rather than living and learning on either side of the border, people resist the either/ors and find a way to incorporate both realms. They are able to embrace both; in fact it is the synthesis and integration of the old and the new that nourishes the passion; the border crossers travel far, but never leave home.\n\nConsider one successful 62-year-old entrepreneur I\u2019ve spoken to at length, who jets all over the world scoring big deals.\n\nHe has always believed that despite the array of technologies he uses every day\u2014smartphone, email, Facebook, Twitter, webinars\u2014the best deals are made face-to-face. There is no substitute for gazing into someone\u2019s eyes, watching someone\u2019s body language, and feeling someone\u2019s handshake.\n\nBut recently this entrepreneur decided to take an online university course in music theory, something he had wanted to learn since his days playing the saxophone in his high-school jazz band.\n\nMusic has always been the thing that makes him feel most alive, and he had always been curious to know the \u201clogic and design\u201d behind jazz music, the basic structures that allowed for improvisation. So even though he is a face-to-face kind of guy, he decided to \u201ccross the border into cyberspace.\u201d\n\nNow after a high-powered meeting at the Taj Mahal in New Delhi, he finds himself racing back to his hotel room and logging on to the computer to complete a homework assignment.\n\nNot only does the learning online require a \u201cdifferent kind of discipline\u201d and a \u201cprivate kind of accountability,\u201d it also seems to combine the odd sensation of intimacy and anonymity with his long-distance professor.\n\nIn cyberspace, he experiences a new kind of creativity, a new way of learning, and renewed passion. He feels freer to ask \u201cdumb\u201d questions, freer to take risks, freer to fail. He says, \u201cCyberspace is my new frontier.\u201d Grinning, he shifts metaphors, \u201cI feel like a kid in a candy shop!\u201d Work crosses over into play. The distance between New Delhi and New York City disappears into nothing.\n\nThis entrepreneur feels himself drawn back home, to the echoes from his childhood, to the music he loves that knows no geographic boundaries.\n\nSara Lawrence-Lightfoot is the Emily Hargroves Fisher professor of Education at Harvard University.
