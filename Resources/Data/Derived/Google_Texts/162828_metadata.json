Even, somewhat ironically, the baseless \u201canti-vaxxer\u201d arguments have prompted greater enthusiasm for the benefits of these miracle medicines. But the other half of the battle has yet to be waged. Where is the serious global immunization campaign for adults and elders?\n\nThere are new vaccines for adults \u2014 everything from pneumonia to shingles \u2014 that can save lives and horrible pain for adults. Preventing pneumonia will also save a fortune in health care costs \u2014 roughly $4 billion annually. In the U.S. alone, about 1 million people are hospitalized with pneumonia each year, and 50,000 die from the disease, according to the Centers for Disease Control. The innovative vaccines available to both kids and \u201cseniors\u201d can actually prevent diseases like pneumonia from ever infecting our bodies in the first place.\n\nBut few people are aware they exist.\n\nWorld Pneumonia Day, November 12, strives to achieve the same goals as the WHO\u2019s Decade of Vaccines: raise awareness of the vaccine and highlight the substantial public health challenge that is occurring at both ends of our age spectrum.\n\nRelated: Why Adult Vaccination Is an Economic No Brainer\n\nThe facts are straightforward, even if the culture of prevention is not. Pneumonia is a life-threatening respiratory infection that has become one of the leading causes of death throughout the world. Moreover, a disease with observable symptoms makes treatment minimally complex.\n\nImmunizations among adults remain below target levels. These substandard vaccination rates create unnecessary costs, unwanted health outcomes, and poor utilization of health resources. A report by the Global Coalition on Aging in 2013 posited the notion of a \u201clife-course approach to immunization.\u201d According to GCOA, this approach is \u201cpromising, but underutilized \u2026 [and] stresses vaccinations throughout all our stages of life.\u201d\n\nPreventing diseases such as pneumococcal pneumonia among older adults can save families and health systems huge amounts of money. Pneumonia can have a dramatic impact on individuals, including missed work, long-term health-related complications, and even death.It can affect caregivers as well, who may also miss work, lose income, and bear emotional consequences as they bear the burden of their parents and grandparents whose pneumonia could have been prevented.\n\nWith 1 billion of us over 60 \u2013 and the most rapidly growing demographic globally over 80 \u2013 surely health officials can also communicate the alerts for adults to reduce their risks of pneumonia through the community-wide use of vaccines. Can\u2019t we in the health community walk and chew gum at the same time? Immunization for the children and for adults!\n\nIt\u2019s time to do something about this growing health challenge, which puts seniors at risk. It is one of the rare moments when public health, economic value, and morality intersect. If we get it right, the marketplace will stimulate further R&D and lead to even more valuable innovation.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "There is considerable attention given to children\u2019s vaccines.", "title": "How to Fight What\u2019s Killing Seniors \u2014 And Win", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2015/11/05/How-Fight-What-s-Killing-Seniors-And-Win", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02122011_doctor_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2015/11/05/How-Fight-What-s-Killing-Seniors-And-Win", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02122011_doctor_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "There is considerable attention given to children\u2019s vaccines.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "There are new vaccines for adults \u2014 everything from pneumonia to shingles \u2014 that can save lives and horrible pain for adults.\nIt\u2019s time to do something about this growing health challenge, which puts seniors at risk.\nThe innovative vaccines available to both kids and \u201cseniors\u201d can actually prevent diseases like pneumonia from ever infecting our bodies in the first place.\nPreventing pneumonia will also save a fortune in health care costs \u2014 roughly $4 billion annually.\nRelated: Why Adult Vaccination Is an Economic No BrainerThe facts are straightforward, even if the culture of prevention is not."}
