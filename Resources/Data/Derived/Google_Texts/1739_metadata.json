Anderson will consult with a specialist on Monday to find out the next step, but according to Rockies trainer Keith Dugger, it\u2019s likely that Anderson will miss the rest of the season.\n\nGonzalez, struggling to stay on the field because of a sprained right ankle and patella tendinitis in his left knee, was placed on the 15-day disabled list Sunday. The Rockies hope he can return to finish out the season, but there is a chance he will be shut down completely.\n\nTaking Gonzalez\u2019s spot on the 25-man roster is first baseman Ben Paulsen, who was recalled from Triple-A Colorado Springs. Paulsen started Sunday afternoon\u2019s game against the Arizona Diamondbacks.\n\nTulowitzki, already on the DL as he battles problems in his left hip area, returned to Denver to continue treatment. He had been working out with the Rockies in Arizona, but he is not close to rejoining the team or going on a minor-league rehab assignment. According to Dugger, Tulo is still feeling \u201con-and-off discomfort\u201d in his hip.\n\nTulowitzki will continue to consult with specialists to aid in his healing process.\n\nAnderson, who left last Tuesday\u2019s game against the Chicago Cubs in the fourth inning because of back spasms, had an MRI on his back Friday and it revealed a bulging disc between the L4 and L5 vertebrae in his lower back.\n\n\u201cWe will consult with a spine surgeon here in Arizona on Monday. Dr. Chris Young,\u201d Dugger said. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty much what I know at this point and time. We will pretty much leave it up to (Young) to decide which direction we will go.\n\n\u201cI will tell you this: Brett is still not feeling very good, he\u2019s having some issues \u2014 not so much back pain, but pain going down his leg. It acts like a typical disc herniation.\u201d\n\nAsked if there was any chance Anderson could pitch again this season, Dugger answered, \u201cI doubt it. It will takes a couple of weeks to calm it down, even if we go the injection route. Then it will take a couple of weeks to get him on his core exercises. It\u2019s a long haul, not a quick fix, even if we go the non-surgical route.\u201d\n\nAnderson is on the disabled list for the second time this season. He already missed 83 games because of a broken finger suffered during an at-bat in April. He underwent Tommy John surgery in 2011 as a member of the Oakland A\u2019s.\n\nAt the end of this season, the Rockies must decide if they want to exercise their $12 million club option on Anderson\u2019s contract.\n\nGonzalez was removed late in Friday night\u2019s game for a double switch because the tendinitis was acting up again. CarGo was not in the starting lineup Saturday night and the Rockies made the decision to put him on the DL after Saturday\u2019s game.\n\n\u201cWe felt like we got to the point where he wasn\u2019t getting any better and it wasn\u2019t make any sense putting him out there,\u201d manager Walt Weiss said. \u201cWe will give him some time to hopefully allow those nagging injuries to calm down.\u201d\n\nGonzalez, hitting .238, has played in only 70 of the Rockies\u2019 117 games.\n\n\u201cI would like to see him back (this season),\u201d Weiss said. \u201cI don\u2019t like to see players shut down the last part of the season. I think it\u2019s important for them to be out there playing and go into the offseason with a healthy mindset and some confidence, as opposed to going into the offseason concentrating on their rehab. Hopefully we will see CarGo back out there.\u201d\n\nCarGo\u2019s right ankle needs some more time to heal completely. As for the tendinitis, it\u2019s a nagging injury that he\u2019ll have to learn to work through, according to Dugger.\n\n\u201cWe know it\u2019s not going away over the night or over a week,\u201d Dugger said. \u201cThere are multiple ways of handling this. But when these guys signed a contract, it\u2019s for the full year. Unfortunately it is. And that\u2019s part of our job to understand. This is a business and a sport.\n\n\u201cIf we think that he\u2019s getting worse, or that he\u2019s at risk, or that he could injure himself, then we\u2019ll take him out. Just like we did the other night, because mentally he couldn\u2019t handle it. And physically, his body is breaking down. He\u2019s had a rough go.\u201d\n\nDugger said that while Tulowitzki is feeling better, multiple doctors are being consulted to try and isolate exactly what\u2019s causing Tulo\u2019s continuing discomfort.\n\n\u201cIt could be a hip labrum or something like that that we can address through the season,\u201d Dugger said. \u201cHe\u2019s not ready to go on a rehab assignment \u2026 so he went back home to hit in the cages and use the pool for some higher-intensity exercises. Right now, he\u2019s not close to going on a rehab assignment, but our goal is for him to finish the season.\u201d\n\nDugger added, \u201cIt\u2019s not a step back. It\u2019s just something we are addressing and maybe the rate isn\u2019t going at what we expected.\u201d\n\nTulo suffers from a muscle imbalance in his left hip and groin area that dates back to the 2008 season when he tore a tendon in his left quadriceps.\n\nTulowitzki, who still leads the National League with a .340 average, has been on the DL since July 20 and has now missed 17 games.\n\nPatrick Saunders: psaunders@denverpost.com or twitter.com/psaundersdp\n\nLooking ahead\n\nRockies\u2019 Jordan Lyles (6-1, 3.72 ERA) at Padres\u2019 Jesse Hahn (7-3, 2.28), 8:10 p.m. Monday, ROOT; 850 AM\n\nDon\u2019t look now, but the Padres are quietly starting to play some solid baseball. Hahn, a 25-year-old right-hander, is part of the reason. Through 10 starts, he has compiled an impressive 1.06 WHIP. He\u2019s struck out 57 batters in 59 innings. Opposing batters are hitting just .184 against him. No Rockies players have faced Hahn at the major-league level.\n\nTuesday: Rockies\u2019 Yohan Flande (0-4, 5.77 ERA) at Padres\u2019 Odrisamer Despaigne (2-3, 3.10), 8:10 p.m., ROOT\n\nWednesday: Rockies\u2019 Tyler Matzek (2-7, 5.32) at Padres\u2019 Ian Kennedy (8-10, 3.51), 4:40 p.m., ROOT\n\nThursday: Reds\u2019 Mike Leake (9-10, 3.42) at Rockies\u2019 Jorge De La Rosa (11-8, 4.34), 6:40 p.m., ROOT\n\nPatrick Saunders, The Denver Post", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Rockies\u2019 woes continue with latest injury news", "title": "Rockies\u2019 woes continue with latest injury news", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/10/rockies-woes-continue-with-latest-injury-news/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140810__anderson2p1.jpg", "height": 482}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140810__anderson2p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-10T13:55:57+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T06:43:23+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cIt could be a hip labrum or something like that that we can address through the season,\u201d Dugger said.\nTulowitzki, already on the DL as he battles problems in his left hip area, returned to Denver to continue treatment.\nIt acts like a typical disc herniation.\u201dAsked if there was any chance Anderson could pitch again this season, Dugger answered, \u201cI doubt it.\nPHOENIX \u2014 Just when it seemed things couldn\u2019t get any worse for the Rockies, it got worse Sunday with injury news regarding Brett Anderson, Carlos Gonzalez and Troy Tulowitzki.\nAt the end of this season, the Rockies must decide if they want to exercise their $12 million club option on Anderson\u2019s contract."}
