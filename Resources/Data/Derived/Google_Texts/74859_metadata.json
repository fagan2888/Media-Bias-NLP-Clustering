They mandate health care providers receive approval from a state government agency for various expenditures, including the construction of new hospitals, the purchase of some medical equipment, and the expansion of existing services, among many others. Currently, 36 states have certificate of need laws, although the number of CON regulations vary significantly by state.\n\nThe goal of CON laws is to reduce health care costs by eliminating unnecessary services and encouraging the consolidation of health care providers. Numerous studies show CON laws have actually caused a number of significant problems.\n\nAccording to research conducted by Thomas Stratmann and Jake Russ at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, states that have enacted CON laws have on average \u201c99 fewer hospital beds per 100,000 people\u201d and \u201c4.7 fewer hospital beds per 100,000 people for each additional service a state regulates,\u201d compared to states without certificate of need laws.\n\nResearch shows this has directly impacted the availability of mental health care services. Out of the 26 states listed as having the greatest number of health professional shortage areas (HPSAs) related to mental health by the Health Resources and Services Administration, a division of the Department of Health and Human Services, 19 states \u2013 approximately 73 percent of the total \u2013 have CON laws.\n\nCON laws have been particularly harmful in rural parts of the nation, which have fewer mental health service providers than more populated regions. In February, research authored by Stratmann and Christopher Koopman and published by the Mercatus Center shows there is a \u201cstatistically significant\u201d correlation between certificate of need laws and the availability of rural hospitals. Stratmann and Koopman also found \u201cCON programs have an even more negative effect on the number of hospitals in rural areas in a state than they do on the overall number of hospitals in the same state.\u201d\n\nThis is particularly troubling because reduced access to mental health care services has been linked to higher suicide rates. According to the National Rural Health Association, suicide rates for men and boys living in rural areas, which have statistically fewer mental health professionals available, are \u201csignificantly higher than in urban areas.\u201d Further, NRHA reports, \u201cThe suicide rate among rural women is escalating rapidly and is approaching that of men.\u201d\n\nOf the 20 states with the highest suicide rates, according to CBS News, 13 have certificate of need regulations in place.\n\nIncreasing public funds to help improve access to mental health care services may have a positive effect, but without more mental health care doctors and facilities, both of which are restricted in many certificate of need states that limit market entry for new and existing hospitals, all the federal funds in the world won\u2019t help to solve this tragic problem.\n\nResearch shows when CON laws are not in place, there are more health care services available, including services to help those with a mental illness. This means by eliminating certificate of need, the lives of countless people suffering with mental health problems will be improved, making the United States a healthier and safer nation for everyone.\n\n-- Justin Haskins\n\nIN THIS ISSUE:\n\nVIRGINIA SENATE SIDELINES EFFORTS TO OVERHAUL HEALTH CARE REGULATORY SYSTEM\n\nVirginia hospitals have prevailed, for this year at least, on one of the most heavily lobbied issues of the 2016 General Assembly \u2013 one that pitted them against the state\u2019s doctors and health care insurers. Efforts supported by physicians and insurers to overhaul or phase out a 40-year-old system of state regulations governing the construction of new health care facilities fizzled out Monday in the state Senate. As a result, the state\u2019s Certificate of Public Need program, which hospitals lobbied vigorously to keep intact, will remain in place at least until 2017. The system requires issuance of a state certificate before new health care services can be introduced in a locality. The most sweeping attempt to overhaul the system, which passed the House of Delegates last month, would have removed the certificate requirement for hospitals, outpatient surgery centers, medical-imaging services and similar facilities by July 1, 2017. By Monday, the only remaining component of those efforts was a much narrower measure that would have removed the certificate requirement only for medical imaging services by Jan. 1, 2019. That bill, HB350, was sent to the Senate Finance Committee and carried over to the 2017 Assembly session.\n\nSOURCE: By Bill Sizemore, The Virginian-Pilot\n\nPUERTO RICO\u2019S FINANCIAL CRISIS THREATENS LOCAL HEALTH CARE SYSTEM\n\nSan Jorge Children\u2019s Hospital is Puerto Rico\u2019s largest pediatric hospital, drawing patients from throughout the Caribbean. ... A nearly decade-long recession has taken a severe toll on the island\u2019s economy. Half of San Jorge\u2019s patients are on Medicaid now, up from a fifth just a few years ago. And, for decades, the U.S. government has capped Medicaid reimbursements in Puerto Rico at a level far below what states receive. [The hospital\u2019s vice president of operations, Domingo Cruz Vivaldi,] says that cap has forced his hospital and many others to cut services \u2013 he\u2019s had to close two wings and 40 rooms. He only managed to avoid staff layoffs, he says, by freezing 100 open positions \u2013 doctors, nurses, technicians and support personnel. And last year, when Puerto Rico ran out of money and couldn\u2019t make a $250 million payment to hospitals, San Jorge was forced to reduce hours and cut pay for all employees. Since long before the advent of Obamacare, Puerto Rico has had a health care plan that covers nearly everyone on the island. Sergio Marxuach, public policy director for Puerto Rico\u2019s Center for a New Economy, says it\u2019s a generous plan, but has never been adequately funded. \u201cIt has become, in a way, the third rail of Puerto Rican politics,\u201d Marxuach says. \u201cNobody wants to touch benefits. Obviously it\u2019s very politically sensitive. Low-income residents love it. So, it\u2019s going to be very hard to modify unless we get additional Medicaid funding, or somehow get some sort of fix that we can do locally.\u201d The head of Puerto Rico\u2019s Health Insurance Administration, Ricardo Rivera-Cardona, describes it in another way. \u201cThere\u2019s a saying here in Puerto Rico,\u201d he says, \u201cwhich, if you translate literally into English, is \u2018You are against the wall and the knife.\u2019\u201d Stopgap funding for Puerto Rico\u2019s Medicaid system that the Affordable Care Act has provided will run out next year. The Obama Administration has proposed a solution: removing the Medicaid cap, and giving Puerto Rico the same level of funding that goes to the states. If Congress doesn\u2019t take action on that proposal soon, Rivera says, Puerto Rico will face tough decisions on how to provide care for 1.6 million Medicaid patients. \u201cWe are looking at one million people that will have to be forced out of the Medicaid system,\u201d Rivera says. \u201cThe remaining 600,000 will have to experience a reduction in benefits and an increase in deductibles and copays.\u201d That\u2019s a problem in a territory where the median household income is about $19,000 \u2013 half that of Mississippi. Across Puerto Rico, clinics are closing, and at least four hospitals have filed for bankruptcy. If enough hospitals close, those remaining will be overwhelmed, say Puerto Rico officials.\n\nSOURCE: By Greg Allen, National Public Radio\n\nNEW HAMPSHIRE BUSINESS LEADERS FIGHT TO REVERSE MEDICAID EXPANSION\n\nThe New Hampshire business community is divided over the future of Medicaid in the state, as the House prepares for a key vote this week on the health insurance program for low-income families and individuals. The statewide Business and Industry Association on Monday urged lawmakers to continue the Medicaid expansion launched two years ago, while a coalition of conservative business owners called the program \u201ccorporate welfare\u201d for the hospitals and insurance companies. More than 135,000 low-income Granite State residents are on traditional Medicaid, meaning they met the requirement of low income and an additional condition, such as dependent children or disability. The House is scheduled to vote this week on a bill \u2013 HB 1696 \u2013 that could decide the fate of another 50,000 residents who have acquired health insurance since eligibility for Medicaid was expanded two years ago. The two-year-old expansion under Obamacare, launched in 2014, raised the qualifying income levels and eliminated additional requirements, so that for the first time in New Hampshire, able-bodied young men or women with no dependent children could qualify for taxpayer-funded health insurance. According to Greg Moore, state director of the Americans for Prosperity Foundation, that has left too many young workers on the sidelines, contributing to a labor shortage in the state. \u201cWith unemployment at 2.9 percent, and jobs going unfilled, it is absolutely essential to give people a reason to work, not an incentive to avoid work,\u201d said Moore. \u201cWe need these people in the workplace.\u201d Moore was surrounded by sympathetic business owners and lawmakers at a press conference in the Legislative Office Building on Monday, as he made the case for a mandatory work requirement that has been added to the Medicaid expansion bill. There is widespread support for a work requirement similar to what is expected of those who receive Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, but there is no guarantee the federal government will approve a Medicaid expansion plan with a \u201cworkfare\u201d provision.\n\nSOURCE: By Dave Solomon, New Hampshire Union Leader\n\nVERMONT CUTTING MEDICAID PAYMENTS TO HOSPITALS\n\n[The State of Vermont] says it is reducing how much it pays the University of Vermont Medical Center and six other hospitals to treat Medicaid patients. The Department of Vermont Health Access released a document Thursday saying it would trim the reimbursement rate to equal what it pays Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center. Dartmouth-Hitchcock sued the state in November, claiming it was not paying the hospital as much as in-state hospitals to treat Vermont Medicaid patients. Forty percent of Dartmouth-Hitchcock\u2019s patients come from Vermont, though not all are insured through Medicaid. On Monday, the Green Mountain Care Board shared a spreadsheet with VTDigger that was labeled as coming from the Department of Vermont Health Access. The Vermont Association of Hospitals and Health Systems, which represents all Vermont hospitals, shared it with its members and the board. The spreadsheet shows that six other hospitals would also see a rate cut: Rutland Regional Medical Center, Central Vermont Medical Center in Berlin, Northwestern Medical Center in St. Albans, Southwestern Vermont Medical Center in Bennington, Brattleboro Memorial Hospital, and the Brattleboro Retreat.\n\nSOURCE: By Erin Mansfield, VTDigger", "article_metadata": {}, "article_summary": "Consumer Power Report #497In January, President Barack Obama announced a proposal to spend $500 million on improving access to mental health care and to provide better mental health information for firearms background checks.\nThe goal of CON laws is to reduce health care costs by eliminating unnecessary services and encouraging the consolidation of health care providers.\nResearch shows this has directly impacted the availability of mental health care services.\nResearch shows when CON laws are not in place, there are more health care services available, including services to help those with a mental illness.\nWhile increasing public funding for mental health programs has been one of the more popular policy proposals offered by lawmakers at the national and state levels, existing government regulations on the health care industry may be more to blame for the lack of mental health care services in some parts of the country, especially in rural regions."}
