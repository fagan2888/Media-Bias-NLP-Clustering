It\u2019s the newest trend in legislation, and it\u2019s not going anywhere soon. As Irin Carmon reports at MSNBC.com: \u201dWelcome to the new culture war, this time rebranded as a battle over religious liberty or freedom. There are the same longstanding debates about sexuality and gender at the center of it. But this time, Christians \u2013 often business owners \u2013 are cast as the downtrodden victims of secularized government encroachment. And the rhetorical strategy, replete with references to liberty and the desire to have a debate, sounds downright progressive.\u201d\n\nCarmon cites the growing creep of \u201creligious liberty\u201d objections seeping into otherwise secular issues, and how now it is becoming a theme that religious liberty means not just personally avoiding an act that allegedly violates one faith, but demanding that others change their actions in order to more easily accommodate your desire to practice your faith unfettered.\n\nThose requests, frankly, are beginning to go past justified and are now bordering on ridiculous.\n\nWe already watched that occur during the jockeying over the Obamacare birth control mandate. Anti-abortion groups and even businesses who do no religious work or outreach but still consider themselves to be \u201creligious\u201d because their leadership belong to churches, continue to fight the mandate claiming violation of faith, even as the government comes up with numerous accommodations to allow them to not offer birth control themselves in their insurance plans.\n\nNone of them have been good enough. No, even signing a slip of paper is a violation of the right to practice religion freely, according to Priests for Life. \u201cAs Father Frank Pavone, the national director of Priests for Life told the Washington Times, his organization will not comply with the law because they believe that doing so would amount to cooperating \u201cin the government\u2019s plan to expand access to birth control and abortion-inducing drugs,\u2019\u201d reports Think Progress.\n\nIf that seems pretty extreme, well, at least Priests for Life bothers to show up in court. According to the Fort Wayne-South Bend Diocese, their religious freedom extends so far that they don\u2019t even have to show up for trials for legal cases they are involved in. Molly Redden at Mother Jones reports that a Catholic grade school is being sued after a teacher was fired for undergoing in vitro fertilization, which the church considers a sin. Citing their right as a religious entity as a justification for violating federal employment rules, the diocese also claimed that it didn\u2019t even need to come to court and defend itself.\n\n\u201cThe diocese argued that a trial on this question would violate its freedom of religion and appealed the judge\u2019s decision to a three-judge panel on the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals,\u201d writes Redden. \u201c\u2018[If] the diocese is required to go through a trial,\u2019 attorneys for the diocese and school argued, it would \u2018irrevocably\u2019 deny Fort Wayne-South Bend the benefits of religious protection.\u201d\n\nIn other words, being forced to defend its discrimination under religious liberty violates the church\u2019s religious liberty.\n\nObviously, the right to practice religion freely is one of our country\u2019s greatest assets, and that means all religions. However, with that right comes the understanding that religious freedom does not trump all. While religion can be practiced freely, it does not protect one from legal challenges when it tramples other people\u2019s constitutional rights, nor does it mean that those religious rights get to be protected from blow-back from people who disagree with you. You have the right to practice religion freely, yes, but you do not have the right to be shielded from contempt or criticism.\n\nYour right to religious expression or free speech is \u201cprotected,\u201d but you are not protected from criticism or consequences.\n\nPhoto credit: Thinkstock", "article_metadata": {"description": "The definition of religious liberty is seeping even further into secular, non-religious matters.", "og": {"image": "http://dingo.care2.com/pictures/causes/3123/3122862.large.jpg"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "34d24671362965e0c3942e7b3b484ea7"}, "fb": {"app_id": 83187307959}, "keywords": "freedom of religion,christian nation,seperation of church and state", "viewport": "width=device-width,user-scalable=no,initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2129\"", "article_summary": "Religious freedom.\nAs Irin Carmon reports at MSNBC.com: \u201dWelcome to the new culture war, this time rebranded as a battle over religious liberty or freedom.\nObviously, the right to practice religion freely is one of our country\u2019s greatest assets, and that means all religions.\nHowever, with that right comes the understanding that religious freedom does not trump all.\n\u201c\u2018[If] the diocese is required to go through a trial,\u2019 attorneys for the diocese and school argued, it would \u2018irrevocably\u2019 deny Fort Wayne-South Bend the benefits of religious protection.\u201dIn other words, being forced to defend its discrimination under religious liberty violates the church\u2019s religious liberty."}
