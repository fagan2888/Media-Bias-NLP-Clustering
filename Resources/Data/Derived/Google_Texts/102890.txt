Derick McKey and Kevie Dixon talk on the sidelines at the annual Derrick McKey Basketball camp. This year, Dixon served as the camp director.

For 16 seasons, Derrick Mckey played in the NBA with the Seattle Sonics, Indiana Pacers and Philadelphia 76ers. Although his playing days are behind him, his basketball camp in Meridian is still going strong.

For over 14 years, youth have gathered at the Meridian High School gymnasium to learn from the former Wildcat, Alabama and NBA star. McKey was joined by other former players such as Alabama teammate Terry Carter and Camp Director Kevie Dixon.

Dixon played professional basketball in Mexico, Switzerland and Argentina.

McKey says the camp is a chance to for him to give back to the city that gave him so much.

"For me, it's just [about] trying to carry on some of the things that I grew up seeing or being around, as far as people that we looked up to when we were growing up," said McKey. "So I just try to carry on and try to do some of the positive things and positive stuff that they were doing back then, and we'll hopefully try to continue to do."

McKey mentioned Jesse Palmer, Sr., Billy Clearman and Mac Williams as men who impacted him as a young man.
