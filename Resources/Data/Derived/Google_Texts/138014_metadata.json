In January, police discovered 16-year-old Jessica Burlew with the corpse of 43-year-old Jason Ash, whom Burlew had strangled to death and mutilated with razor blades in the midst of \u201ca sex game.\u201d\n\nLive Action observes that Planned Parenthood is an ObamaCare grant recipient.\n\n\u201cPlanned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains is already bragging about receiving ObamaCare grants specifically for sex education,\u201d said Lila Rose, Live Action\u2019s president, in a press release. \u201cHere\u2019s an abortion corporation, which gets 45% of its budget from the taxpayers, telling 15- and 16-year-olds not only to have sex, but also to choke each other in the process. Police should be busting down its door.\u201d\n\nAt its Planned Parenthood Exposed site, Live Action lists a number of disturbing marketing practices and counsel from Planned Parenthood staff, including the \u201cresource\u201d website Go Ask Alice! which is sponsored by Columbia University. The site answers questions about sexual practices such as bondage and discipline and sado-masochistic role-playing, as well as others such as playing with feces.\n\nA site for Planned Parenthood of Hudson Peconic also contains information about a seminar for educators called \u201c50 Shades of Safe,\u201d which seeks to explain \u201chow a BDSM relationship is successfully navigated between sexual partners.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Planned Parenthood-approved advice of \u2018do whatever you want, but just use a safe word\u2019 glorifies kids acting out rape scenarios,\u201d Rose said. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely dangerous counseling: they\u2019re undermining and invalidating the crucially important rule of no means no.\u201d\n\nIn the video, one Planned Parenthood counselor tells Live Action\u2019s investigator that a young girl\u2019s use of words like \u201cstop\u201d when she is uncomfortable \u201ccan get mixed up,\u201d resulting in the male partner wondering, \u201cDoes she really mean \u2018stop,\u2019 or does she mean, you know, whatever?\u201d\n\nThe other counselor agrees, saying, \u201cUsually, a lot of people will say \u2018stop\u2019 even though it feels good, so that\u2019s usually not something that is used.\u201d\n\nLive Action is calling on Colorado residents to contact their local officials, including school administrators.\n\n\u201cParents need to get on the phone right now,\u201d Rose said, \u201cand ask their principals and superintendents, \u2018Do you have a relationship with Planned Parenthood? Are you okay with this sort of behavior being pushed on my children?\u2019 This won\u2019t stop until people take action locally for their kids.\u201d\n\nA previous installment of \u201cSexEd\u201d showed the Planned Parenthood affiliate in Indianapolis giving advice to the undercover investigator on how to practice BDSM and access sex shops and pornographic websites.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Planned Parenthood's Sex Ed Pushes BDSM, 'Asphyxiation' to Teens", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Planned Parenthood's Sex Ed Pushes BDSM, 'Asphyxiation' to Teens", "title": "Planned Parenthood's Sex Ed Pushes BDSM, 'Asphyxiation' to Teens - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2014/07/15/bondage-gear-AP.jpg", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2014/07/15/planned-parenthood-s-sex-ed-pushes-bdsm-asphyxiation-on-teens/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Planned Parenthood's Sex Ed Pushes BDSM, 'Asphyxiation' to Teens", "title": "Planned Parenthood's Sex Ed Pushes BDSM, 'Asphyxiation' to Teens - Breitbart", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2014/07/15/bondage-gear-AP.jpg", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": ",Big Government,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "published_time": "2014-07-15T07:03:00-07:00", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd574e\"", "article_summary": "Police should be busting down its door.\u201dAt its Planned Parenthood Exposed site, Live Action lists a number of disturbing marketing practices and counsel from Planned Parenthood staff, including the \u201cresource\u201d website Go Ask Alice!\n\u201cPlanned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains is already bragging about receiving ObamaCare grants specifically for sex education,\u201d said Lila Rose, Live Action\u2019s president, in a press release.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERPro-life organization Live Action has introduced another investigative video exposing Planned Parenthood\u2019s disturbing practice of advising young girls about dangerous sex activities such as bondage/discipline and sadomasochistic sex (BDSM).\n\u201cParents need to get on the phone right now,\u201d Rose said, \u201cand ask their principals and superintendents, \u2018Do you have a relationship with Planned Parenthood?\nThe investigations are part of Live Action\u2019s series titled \u201cSexEd: Planned Parenthood\u2019s Dangerous Sex Advice for Kids.\u201d The latest expos\u00e9 features the abortion giant\u2019s facilities in Denver, Colorado."}
