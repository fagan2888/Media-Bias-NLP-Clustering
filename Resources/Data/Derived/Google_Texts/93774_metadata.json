So, if you can get outpatient services, hospitalization and medicine for a heart attack, you can get it for depression, too. And the law says it can\u2019t cost more.\n\nThe Obama administration recently announced the strengthening of a similar federal parity law, which is not tied to the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe health reform law, however, does offer some new benefits for people with mental disorders. Depression and other disorders will no longer keep you from getting insurance or cause you to pay a higher premium. And depression screenings and behavioral assessments will be offered free of charge.\n\nThe law also specifically includes services for mental health and substance use disorders in its list of required benefits, so there\u2019s no getting around it. All new plans will let you see a counselor regularly, seek specialty care related to mental illness, be hospitalized and get prescription drugs. Generally, your copay or cost share for such services will match those for comparable medical services.\n\nThe Orders: Talk to your doctor about which insurance she accepts.\n\nD\u2019Alonzo said keeping her current counselor will be at the top of her wish list when she goes shopping on the exchange. Currently, Covered California\u2019s doctor directory is far from perfect, so it\u2019s best she asks her doctor which insurance she accepts before making a decision.\n\nOther than that, it\u2019s all about comparing prices. Mental health is covered, but what she pays per visit depends on what she pays in premiums.\n\nCheck out last week\u2019s Second Opinion: What does Obamacare mean for health savings accounts?\n\nThis article relates to: City Heights, Community, Health Care, News, Share\n\nWritten by Megan Burks Megan Burks is a reporter for Speak City Heights, a media project of Voice of San Diego, KPBS, Media Arts Center and The AjA Project.
