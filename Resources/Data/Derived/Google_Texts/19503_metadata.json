Hill wrote and sent the letter without telling his attorneys, who he says took advantage of his \u201cignorance\u201d and misled him about signing the plea agreement.\n\nHill and his brother, 25-year-old Lynell, accepted plea agreements and were sentenced in January for their roles in the deaths at Fero\u2019s Bar and Grill on Oct. 17, 2012. As part of their plea agreements, the two will testify against a third defendant, Dexter Lewis.\n\nLewis faces the death penalty in the case. Prosecutors claim he inflicted the fatal stab wounds on all five victims.\n\nDenver District Court Judge John Madden, who is presiding over both Lewis and Hill\u2019s cases, released Hill\u2019s letter to the public for the first time this week.\n\nIn his letter, Hill said he was under extreme duress after his attorneys told him prosecutors would seek the death penalty and, because of evidence and statements he and co-defendants made, would likely succeed. After he pleaded guilty to five counts of first-degree murder, his attorneys told him several mitigating factors \u2014 such as no criminal history \u2014 would have likely prevented prosecutors from obtaining the death penalty in his case.\n\nDenver prosecutors never said they intended to seek the death penalty against either Hill brother.\n\n\u201cYou (Madden) asked me if I was promised anything, I answered incorrectly,\u201d Hill wrote. \u201cI was promised death if I didn\u2019t cooperate, my own and my brothers.\u201d\n\nDuring a hearing in the Lewis case on May 9, Hill\u2019s attorneys said they had not yet read the letter. On May 30, Hill\u2019s legal team filed a motion asking Madden to keep the letter sealed and told the judge they now had a conflict of interest in representing Lewis.\n\n\u201cIt is extremely difficult to withdraw a guilty plea,\u201d said defense attorney David Lane, who is not representing any of the defendants connected to the deaths.\n\nJudges thoroughly advise defendants of their rights and ensure they are making their plea freely, before they accept a plea agreement, Lane said. Hill\u2019s legal team now has a conflict in representing him because now they have the right to defend themselves against his claims that they misled him.\n\nDenver attorney Patrick Ridley has been temporarily assigned to represent Hill.\n\nJordan Steffen: 303-954-1794, jsteffen@denverpost.com or twitter.com/jsteffendp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Defendant sentenced in Fero\u2019s murders wants to withdraw guilty plea", "title": "Defendant sentenced in Fero\u2019s murders wants to withdraw guilty plea", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/06/20/defendant-sentenced-in-feros-murders-wants-to-withdraw-guilty-plea/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140620__lynell-hillp1.jpg", "height": 445}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140620__lynell-hillp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-20T14:50:36+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T08:28:47+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2cda\"", "article_summary": "Denver District Court Judge John Madden, who is presiding over both Lewis and Hill\u2019s cases, released Hill\u2019s letter to the public for the first time this week.\nIn April, Joseph Hill, 28, mailed a letter to the judge who sentenced him to prison, announcing his desire to withdraw his guilty plea.\nDenver prosecutors never said they intended to seek the death penalty against either Hill brother.\nLewis faces the death penalty in the case.\nJudges thoroughly advise defendants of their rights and ensure they are making their plea freely, before they accept a plea agreement, Lane said."}
