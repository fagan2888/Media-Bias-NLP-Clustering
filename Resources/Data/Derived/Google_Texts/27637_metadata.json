It was an odd favorite, because I otherwise avoided politics. The cathartic laughter over revelations of American hypocrisy and that calming moment of zen at the show\u2019s end made it possible to learn about our government\u2019s failures while staying optimistic. I never thought I\u2019d someday be 26, still watching \u201cThe Daily Show,\u201d and struck by this idea: Jon Stewart will help save America\u2019s health care system.\n\nWhen Stewart is not interviewing Scarlett Johansson or Johnny Knoxville, he\u2019s building a strong case for why we must fight for a truly humane, affordable health care system \u2013 a single-payer universal health care system that substantially upgrades Obamacare. Thanks in part to guests like Johansson and Knoxville, \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d is a megaphone reaching the key 18 to 49 age demographic; it ranks first in all of current late-night TV for winning our age group\u2019s hearts and minds.\n\nBack in October 2013, the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services, Kathleen Sebelius, appeared on the show to sell us whippersnappers Obamacare insurance. Obamacare depends on young, healthy folks to enter into its marketplace and balance the costs of older and sicker citizens.\n\n\u201cYoung people,\u201d said Sebelius, \u201care one fall on the basketball court, one auto accident away, from a lifetime of hospital bills they can\u2019t pay.\u201d\n\nSebelius\u2019 nudge felt almost endearing, like the effort of a concerned mother to protect her kin. But one must ask, how reformed is Obamacare if it will leave any of us or our loved ones vulnerable to \u201ca lifetime of hospital bills\u201d we \u201ccan\u2019t pay\u201d?\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t get to pick and choose when we get sick,\u201d Sebelius continued. \u201cYou\u2019re more likely to live sicker and die younger without insurance.\u201d\n\n\u201cExactly,\u201d Stewart said and spiked the conversational volleyball, \u201cwhich is why I don\u2019t understand the idea of staying with a market-based solution for a problem where people can\u2019t be smart consumers.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "If America is ever to have a real single-payer healthcare system, it might be thanks to the \"Daily Show\" host", "title": "Jon Stewart will save us!
