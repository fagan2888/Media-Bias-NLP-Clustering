But in that same period some 7 million more Americans reached employment age, and we have only produced about half the jobs we need to keep up with population growth. To make matters worse, the jobs created during the recovery pay on average much less than those lost. Yet rather than pulling out all the stops to create more and better jobs, too many politicians and economists tell us we can\u2019t move too quickly. They cite limitation after limitation: inflation fears, budget deficits, skills mismatches, and so on. Americans deserve better than this defeatism. We deserve bold action.\n\nIn a new report, A Bold Approach to the Jobs Emergency, the Bernard L. Schwartz Rediscovering Government Initiative offers fifteen ideas that could get us back to true full employment and at the same time build a foundation for rapid economic growth in the future. We are demanding a full-court press to recreate the economic opportunity that America once offered. We emphasize some ideas that have been heard before, but many that are forced to the back seat or are hardly talked about at all.\n\nThere are taboos among policymakers that are holding us back. Above all, we must take fiscal stimulus seriously again. Today\u2019s economy operates far below its growth potential. The fiscal stimulus we need should not only make the social safety net whole but also be tied to aggressive investment in transportation, communications, and clean technologies that have been badly neglected.\n\nThe federal government can itself create useful, good-paying jobs in transportation, teaching, and health care. A carefully crafted federal job creation program, as was successfully enacted under FDR, can work today. Fifty billion dollars worth of new jobs could go a long way toward helping Americans.\n\nThe repressive effect on jobs and wages that results from aggressive Wall Street practices is all but invisible in Washington. Academic economists are almost as bad as the Washington think tanks in paying too little attention to how big finance can undermine both jobs and wages. Our report highlights the findings of researchers such as Eileen Appelbaum, formerly of Rutgers, and Rosemary Batt of Cornell, who show that the leveraged buyout and privatization crazes have on average led to many lost jobs and significantly less spending on R&D. It also showcases the work of William Lazonick of the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, who has long called attention to how massive corporate stock buybacks may help shareholders in the short run but hurt the American economy by diverting investment.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bankrupt ideology, narrow politics and bad economics are robbing us of our future", "title": "Why are we so afraid of a comprehensive jobs plan?", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Bankrupt ideology, narrow politics and bad economics are robbing us of our future", "title": "Why are we so afraid of a comprehensive jobs plan?", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/04/12/why_are_we_so_afraid_of_a_comprehensive_jobs_plan_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/04/economy1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Bankrupt ideology, narrow politics and bad economics are robbing us of our future", "title": "Why are we so afraid of a comprehensive jobs plan?", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/04/economy1.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Jeff Madrick", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Jobs, Next New Deal, U.S. Economy", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The repressive effect on jobs and wages that results from aggressive Wall Street practices is all but invisible in Washington.\nTo make matters worse, the jobs created during the recovery pay on average much less than those lost.\nThe federal government can itself create useful, good-paying jobs in transportation, teaching, and health care.\nAcademic economists are almost as bad as the Washington think tanks in paying too little attention to how big finance can undermine both jobs and wages.\nFifty billion dollars worth of new jobs could go a long way toward helping Americans."}
