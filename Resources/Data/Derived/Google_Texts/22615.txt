During an ABC panel discussion on the 2014 midterms Sunday morning, Cokie Roberts conceded that the GOP has done “a much better job” of not electing “yahoos” in their congressional primaries, bettering their chances in the fall elections.



“The likelihood is the Republicans take the Senate,” Roberts said on This Week With George Stephanopoulos. “But there are a lot of things that have to happen, and one of them is Republican primaries have to come out the way Republicans want. Now, some states they can nominate yahoos, and the yahoos will win. But other states, if they nominate yahoos, the Democrat’s likely to win.”

Former Mitt Romney foreign policy advisor Dan Senor objected to this, noting that the GOP had tamped down on extreme right-wing challengers in many states to nominate more viable general election candidates.

“Look at Tom Cotton in Arkansas and Dan Sullivan in Alaska,” Senor said. “You just go across the spectrum. In Colorado, we had a crazy right-winger who would have lost the general election. He got out. Suddenly Cory Gardner, who can win, has gotten in.”

“You’ve done a much better job,” Roberts said.
