In 2013 alone, corporations claimed more than $93 billion worth of tax credits, TIGTA said.\n\nThe auditors identified more than 3,000 electronically filed forms through the U.S. Corporation Income Tax Return that had potentially erroneous credits totaling more than $2.7 billion. Auditors also found that companies had claimed another $35 million worth of improper payments through a tax provision for small businesses that had already expired. Yet the IRS failed to catch these mistakes.\n\n\u201cGiven the amount of potential tax revenue at risk, it is imperative that the IRS improve its processes to ensure that corporations accurately claim carry-forward general business credits,\u201d Inspector General J. Russell George said in the report.\n\nOn the flip side, auditors said a programming error also caused some businesses that filed electronically to miss out on certain tax breaks that they claimed. That includes about $170 million in Empowerment Zone Employment Credits.\n\nRelated: Government Blows $125 Billion in Improper Payments\n\nThe IRS has said it\u2019s corrected the problem. Officials, though, are unable to determine how many similar errors occurred with tax returns filed on paper.\n\nTIGTA recommended the agency determine whether the same programming error also affected paper-filed business returns \u2013 and if so, take actions to correct the programming.\n\nThe IRS agreed with the auditor\u2019s recommendations but said it can\u2019t assure TIGTA they\u2019ll be implemented by 2016 \u201cdue to other priorities competing for the same resources.\u201d\n\nIRS officials have repeatedly warned of the difficulties of this tax season due to the agency\u2019s dwindling budget. Late last year, Congress slashed its budget by $346 million for 2015. The IRS\u2019s budget \u2013 routinely subject to massive cuts \u2013 is now at about $10.9 billion. That\u2019s $1 billion less than it was five years ago.\n\nRelated: Underfunded IRS Begins Crucial Obamacare Test\n\nTIGTA\u2019s report comes when the federal government overall is struggling to rein in hundreds of billions of dollars issued in erroneous payments every year. A report from the Government Accountability Office last month said the government handed out $124.7 billion in improper payments \u2013 the most GAO has recorded recently. That represented a nearly 17 percent increase from the previous year when improper payments totaled $105.8 billion.\n\nMuch of the increase came from Medicare, Medicaid and the Earned Income Tax Credit, which accounted for about 76 percent of the total estimate, GAO said.\n\nThe Obama administration and Congress have tried repeatedly to crack down on improper payments. Agencies aim to document the number of improper payments they make each year through each specific program, as well as how much it costs the government. However, some departments have been slow to follow the process.\n\nIn 2010 Congress also approved a measure mandating all inspectors general keep track of their agencies\u2019 efforts to reduce improper payments. So far, the IGs say the agencies are making progress \u2013 but as the new report suggests, there is more work to be done.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The Internal Revenue Service doled out nearly $3 billion in erroneous business tax cre", "title": "IRS\u2019s $3 Billion Error\u2014Companies Get Windfall in Unearned Tax Credits", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/20/IRS-s-3-Billion-Error-Companies-Get-3-Billion-Unearned-Tax-Credits", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/01192011_taxes_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/20/IRS-s-3-Billion-Error-Companies-Get-3-Billion-Unearned-Tax-Credits", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/01192011_taxes_article.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@Briannaehley"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "The Internal Revenue Service doled out nearly $3 billion in erroneous business tax cre", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "In 2013 alone, corporations claimed more than $93 billion worth of tax credits, TIGTA said.\nThe Internal Revenue Service doled out nearly $3 billion in erroneous business tax credits in 2013 to corporations that should not have qualified for the breaks \u2013 all at taxpayer expense.\nA newly released report from the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) said the billions in improper payments came through carry-forward business tax credits to companies that filed electronically.\nThat represented a nearly 17 percent increase from the previous year when improper payments totaled $105.8 billion.\nAuditors also found that companies had claimed another $35 million worth of improper payments through a tax provision for small businesses that had already expired."}
