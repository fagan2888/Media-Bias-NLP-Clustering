It takes a village,\u201d Shields said. \u201cAnd for me, it was truly a village. Nobody gets to the top by themselves. Someone had to push, prod and pull me through the tough times. Someone helped me walk through the tough steps and be forever grateful.\u201d\n\nShields is arguably one of the best third-round picks in the history of the game and he was the heart and soul of one of the greatest offensive lines ever put together with Willie Roaf, Brian Waters, Casey Wiegmann, and John Tait in the early 2000\u2019s.\n\nHis tenure in Kansas City may never be equaled as he did not start his first game as a rookie back in 1993, but when a teammate got injured in the first half, Shields went into the game after halftime and then never missed a start for the next 14 years.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Former Kansas City Chiefs guard Will Shields became the ninth member of the franchise to enter the Pro Football Hall of Fame Saturday evening and he did it with", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"url": "http://www.examiner.com/article/will-shields-makes-kansas-city-proud-with-his-induction-into-the-hall-of-fame", "site_name": "Examiner.com", "image": "http://cdn2-b.examiner.com/sites/default/files/styles/image_content_width/hash/e7/73/e77394815ef5d02fe8de07fdadbce032.jpg?itok=0kwpTCwG", "type": "article", "title": "Will Shields makes Kansas City proud with his induction into the Hall of Fame"}, "twitter": {"description": "Former Kansas City Chiefs guard Will Shields became the ninth member of the franchise to enter the Pro Football Hall of Fame Saturday evening and he did it with the kind of quiet dignity that has made", "creator": "@dadrose62", "image": "http://cdn2-b.examiner.com/sites/default/files/styles/image_content_width/hash/e7/73/e77394815ef5d02fe8de07fdadbce032.jpg?itok=0kwpTCwG", "title": "Will Shields makes Kansas City proud with his induction into the Hall of Fame", "site": "@examinercom", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "dc.date.issued": "2015-08-09T08:56:28-06:00", "fb": {"app_id": 113003962065478}, "keywords": "NFL, Kansas City Chiefs, Will Shields, 2015 Hall of Fame Inductees", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-09T08:56"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb333\"", "article_summary": "It takes a village,\u201d Shields said.\nFormer Kansas City Chiefs guard Will Shields became the ninth member of the franchise to enter the Pro Football Hall of Fame Saturday evening and he did it with the kind of quiet dignity that has made him one of the most popular Chiefs of all time to the fans.\nIt was a very humble Kansas City way of deflecting praise to others that fit the career of a man like Shields, who earned 12 straight Pro Bowls during his brilliant Chiefs career, but never drew headlines like the runners he blocked for.\nOn a night when Notre Dame stars like Tim Brown and Jerome Bettis talked for what seemed like forever, and Sydney Seau brought everyone to tears with her emotional induction of her late father, Junior Seau, Shields spent his time simply thanking just about anyone who touched his life on the football field.\nSomeone had to push, prod and pull me through the tough times."}
