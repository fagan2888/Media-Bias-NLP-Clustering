Insurance prices in northern Illinois are spiking by more than 20 percent on the marketplace that's a cornerstone of the Affordable Care Act.

The Illinois Department of Insurance released today a detailed look at health insurance prices for 2016. 18 counties in northern Illinois* are seeing price increases (for the cost of a mid-range Silver Plan policy) of more than 20 percent - in some cases close to 30 percent.

In the state, only Chicago/Cook County saw decreases.

*DeKalb, Winnebago, Boone, Ogle, Bureau, Whiteside in the 25-30 % range, Kane & DuPage 20-25, LaSalle in the 10-15 % area, everyone else 15-20.
