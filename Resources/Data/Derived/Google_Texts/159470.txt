President Barack Obama will visit the Alaskan Arctic to view firsthand the effects of climate change—and he’s inviting the nation to follow along.

Later this month, I’m going to Alaska. And I’m going because Alaskans are on the front lines of one of the greatest challenges we face this century: climate change,” he says in the video below.

“You see, climate change once seemed like a problem for future generations,” he continues. “But for most Americans, it’s already a reality: deeper droughts, longer wildfire seasons; some of our cities even flood at high tide.”

In Alaska the effects are quite graphic.

“Glaciers are melting. The hunting and fishing upon which generations have depended for their way of life and for their jobs are being threatened. Storm surges once held at bay now endanger entire villages,” he says.

The Obama administration has been working to draw awareness to climate change via several initiatives, ranging from the National Climate Assessment issued in 2014, to a series of executive orders mandating measures to combat its effects.

“What’s happening in Alaska isn’t just a preview of what will happen to the rest of us if we don’t take action,” Obama says in the video, inviting the nation to sign up to receive dispatches from his trip. “It’s our wakeup call. The alarm bells are ringing. And as long as I’m President, America will lead the world to meet this threat before it’s too late.”
