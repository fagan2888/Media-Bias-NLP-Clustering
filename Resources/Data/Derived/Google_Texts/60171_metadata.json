He went 3-for-5 with two home runs Sunday in the Rockies\u2019 8-6 loss to the San Diego Padres. It was the second multihomer game of his career, the previous time coming April 5, 2014, against Arizona at Coors Field.\n\nBoth of Arenado\u2019s home runs came off Padres ace James Shields.\n\n\u201cI watched a lot of video of him, and he\u2019s a good pitcher,\u201d Arenado said. \u201cI just went up there and tried to hit the ball hard. He made me look foolish in that first at-bat. He wanted to throw a good changeup on that first homer, but he didn\u2019t put it (where) he wanted, and I took advantage of it.\u201d\n\nArenado, who boosted his batting average to .314, ranks fifth in the National League with 14 extra-base hits.\n\nBlackmon heating up. Center fielder Charlie Blackmon also hit two homers Sunday, the first a leadoff shot against Shields to open the game, the second a one-out homer off closer Craig Kimbrel in the ninth. It was Blackmon\u2019s second multihomer game of his career. His homer in the first inning was the Rockies\u2019 first leadoff home run this season.\n\nSunday lineup. Manager Walt Weiss knew first baseman Justin Morneau had hit Shields well in the past \u2014 a .320 average (16-for-50) with four home runs. Still, Weiss gave Morneau the day off, as well as shortstop Troy Tulowitzki.\n\nMorneau is not hurt, but he was 0-for-8 in this series and Weiss figured he needed a break.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing going on. It\u2019s just a day I targeted for both of them,\u201d Weiss said.\n\nIn other words, he\u2019s sticking to his game plan to give veterans such as Morneau and Tulo designated days off.\n\nRoberts debuts. Left-handed reliever Ken Roberts, called up from Triple-A Albuquerque on Saturday, made his major-league debut. He pitched a scoreless eighth, plunking Yonder Alonso but getting Yangervis Solarte to fly out to deep center, inducing Derek Norris to foul out to first baseman Daniel Descalso and finishing the inning by getting Alexi Amarista to ground out to short.\n\nFootnotes. The Padres were not playing well when the Rockies arrived, but they took three games for their first series sweep of the season. \u2026 Shields improved to 3-0 despite pitching a season-low 5 innings and allowing a season-high five runs on a season-high nine hits. \u2026 Justin Upton hit a two-run homer off slumping Rockies starter Kyle Kendrick in the first. Upton has 21 career homers against the Rockies, his most against any opponent.\n\nLooking ahead\n\nDiamondbacks\u2019 Josh Collmenter (2-3, 2.76 ERA) at Rockies\u2019 Tyler Matzek (2-0, 2.70), 6:40 p.m. Monday, ROOT; 850 AM\n\nIt hasn\u2019t always been pretty, but Matzek has been the Rockies\u2019 most dependable starter this year, with the Rockies winning three of his four starts. He will be working on an extra day of rest \u2014 a good thing because he left his last start, at Arizona, with a cramp in his hamstring. Matzek has faced the D-backs three times in his career, going 2-1 with a 2.65 ERA. Collmenter dominated the Rockies last Wednesday in Phoenix, allowing just one unearned run in eight innings in Arizona\u2019s 9-1 victory.\n\nTuesday: Diamondbacks\u2019 Robbie Ray (2015 debut) at Rockies\u2019 Jordan Lyles (2-2, 4.25), 6:40 p.m., ROOT\n\nWednesday: Diamondbacks\u2019 Rubby De La Rosa (2-2, 5.40) at Rockies\u2019 Eddie Butler (2-2, 3.81), 1:10 p.m., no TV\n\nThursday: Off\n\nFriday: Dodgers\u2019 Brett Anderson (1-1, 4.21) at Rockies\u2019 Jorge De La Rosa (0-2, 9.00), 6:40 p.m., ROOT\n\nPatrick Saunders, The Denver Post", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Rockies\u2019 Nolan Arenado has a bat to match his hot glove", "title": "Rockies\u2019 Nolan Arenado has a bat to match his hot glove", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/05/03/rockies-nolan-arenado-has-a-bat-to-match-his-hot-glove/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150503__bbn-arenadop1-1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150503__bbn-arenadop1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-03T21:20:44+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-24T11:07:34+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce45d\"", "article_summary": "SAN DIEGO \u2014 The All-Star Game in Cincinnati is 71 days away, but Rockies third baseman Nolan Arenado is making his bid right now.\nIt was the second multihomer game of his career, the previous time coming April 5, 2014, against Arizona at Coors Field.\nHe went 3-for-5 with two home runs Sunday in the Rockies\u2019 8-6 loss to the San Diego Padres.\nManager Walt Weiss knew first baseman Justin Morneau had hit Shields well in the past \u2014 a .320 average (16-for-50) with four home runs.\nThe two-time Gold Glove winner hogged the highlight reels with his diamond gems in April, and now his bat is doing damage."}
