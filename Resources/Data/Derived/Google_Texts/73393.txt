Former Massachusetts Governor and GOP Presidential Nominee Mitt Romney insists he isn't running for President of the United States in 2016, even to stop Donald Trump.

"I'm not running and I'm not going to be running," Romney said on NBC over the weekend while keeping the door open should he be named at a brokered convention in July.

But according to paperwork filed with the Federal Elections Commission last month, a Romney presidential run isn't being completely ruled out.
