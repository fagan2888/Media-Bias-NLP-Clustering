What he saw in Greenwood shocked him. \"Segregation there was the most extreme I\u2019ve ever seen,\" said Fiel. \"There were literally less than five white kids in an entire public school.\" Fiel's experience as a teacher inspired him to go to graduate school in sociology to study segregation and inequality in education. Now a Ph.D. candidate at University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison, Fiel recently published a study in the American Sociological Review that suggests the factors driving segregation have increased in scale in the past several decades\u2014and that fixing the problem will require a new set of strategies.\n\nNearly 60 years after the landmark Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court decision that ordered school districts to desegregate, schools seem to be trending back toward their segregated pasts. In the 1968-69 school year, when the U.S. Department of Education started to enforce Brown, about 77 percent of black students and 55 percent of Latino students attended public schools that were more than half-minority. By the 2009-2010 school year, the picture wasn't much better for black students, and it was far worse for Latinos: 74 percent of black students and 80 percent of Latino students went to schools that were more than half-minority. More than 40 percent of black and Latino students attended schools that were 90 percent to 100 percent minority. Related Story American Education Isn't Mediocre\u2014It's Deeply Unequal The persistence of segregation is a problem because, today as in the Brown era, separate schools are unequal. \"Schools of concentrated poverty and segregated minority schools are strongly related to an array of factors that limit educational opportunities and outcomes,\" wrote the authors of a 2012 report by the University of California\u2013Los Angeles's Civil Rights Project. \"These include less experienced and less qualified teachers, high levels of teacher turnover, less successful peer groups and inadequate facilities and learning materials.\" Fiel's study found that one factor that's led to the decline of white students in minority-heavy schools is the fact that white people make up a smaller proportion of the overall student population: Jeremy E. Fiel, American Sociological Review Whites are nearly a minority in the U.S. population under the age of five, and Census projections predict that by 2043, whites will no longer be the majority of the U.S. population overall. \"There\u2019s going to be fewer whites in minority schools because there are fewer whites in the population,\" said Fiel. Another part of the problem is with desegregation policies themselves. At the time of the Brown decision, schools in the same district were vastly unequal to one another, so efforts went toward integrating schools within each district. That made sense to combat segregation as it existed at the time.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new study offers two answers: White people are making up a smaller percentage of the population than they used to, and different races are living in different school districts.", "author": "Eleanor Barkhorn", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "A new study offers two answers: White people are making up a smaller percentage of the population than they used to, and different races are living in different school districts.", "title": "Why Are American Schools Still Segregated?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2013/11/AP630909079_resize/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2013/11/Why-Are-American-Schools-Still-Segregated/281126/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "\"There\u2019s going to be fewer whites in minority schools because there are fewer whites in the population,\" said Fiel.\nAt the time of the Brown decision, schools in the same district were vastly unequal to one another, so efforts went toward integrating schools within each district.\nMore than 40 percent of black and Latino students attended schools that were 90 percent to 100 percent minority.\nRelated Story American Education Isn't Mediocre\u2014It's Deeply Unequal The persistence of segregation is a problem because, today as in the Brown era, separate schools are unequal.\n\"Schools of concentrated poverty and segregated minority schools are strongly related to an array of factors that limit educational opportunities and outcomes,\" wrote the authors of a 2012 report by the University of California\u2013Los Angeles's Civil Rights Project."}
