As a self-described libertarian, Mr Leyonhjelm supports same sex-marriage, for example, whereas Family First is opposed.\n\nBob Day, federal chairman of the Family First Party. Photo: David Mariuz\n\nThe two-member bloc is half the size of the Palmer United-Ricky Muir alliance, but is likely to provide some headaches for the government - particularly if its agenda involves any new taxes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr Day believes the minimum wage should be lowered to get people into work and taxes should be lowered across the board.\n\nOn Mr Leyonhjelm's policy agenda is privatisation of schools and hospitals, a lower minimum wage and lower tobacco taxes.\n\n''Unlike the PUP senators, who are only united by Clive's funding, Bob and I share the same values,'' he said. ''That makes us a mini-voting bloc.''\n\nMr Leyonhjelm said he would defer to Mr Day on any industrial relations issue and Mr Day will take his advice on agriculture.\n\nPrime Minister Tony Abbott is taking the lead hand in negotiating with the new crossbenchers. He met Mr Day on Wednesday and sat down in Sydney with Mr Leyonhjelm on Friday.\n\nMr Leyonhjelm said the Prime Minister laid out his legislative agenda for July, which focused on the abolition of the carbon and mining taxes, restoration of the Australian Building and Construction Commission and changes to the Fair Work Act.\n\nAfter the meeting, Mr Leyonhjelm said: ''I quite like the guy, he speaks his mind, a bit like me.''\n\nOn Tuesday, Mr Day and Mr Leyonhjelm delivered speeches to the Centre for Independent Studies.\n\nMr Leyonhjelm said: ''We will push for doing less on nanny state stuff. An end to plain packaging, lower tobacco taxes and fewer smoking rules affecting private property. Stop funding public health advocates who want to control what we eat. Stop funding the environmental organisations that oppose everything about modern society.\n\n''I also intend to press buttons on health and education. There is no justification for the government being a service provider in these. It has a role to determine policy, set standards, monitor quality and inform the public. It does not need to own schools or hospitals, or to employ teachers, doctors or nurses.\n\n''Service providers, whether they are for profit, charitable or community, will do the job better than public servants. So long as there is a safety net for those who are seriously out of luck, the government should get out of it.''\n\nWhen it comes to smaller government, Mr Leyonhjelm said: ''I do not draw the line anywhere.\n\n''I have every intention of using my vote to try and make a difference. I will use argument, reason, pleading and occasionally blackmail.''\n\nIn his speech, Mr Day questioned why when Newstart paid $250 a week and the minimum wage was $650, people couldn't choose to work for less than the minimum, but higher than the dole.\n\n''We praise people who work for zero money - volunteers who work up to 40 hours a week in op-shops and nursing homes, but we don't allow them to work for more than zero until you reach $650. It's absurd,'' he said.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Political News", "application-name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "og": {"site_name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "description": "The Abbott government faces a new hurdle in the Senate, with Family First and the Liberal Democratic Party forming a ''voting bloc''.", "title": "Senate's odd couple quickly form a voting bloc", "url": "http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/senates-odd-couple-quickly-form-a-voting-bloc-20140531-39b6h.html", "image": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/2/u/r/1/w/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.39b6h.png/1401555600000.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/2/u/r/1/w/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.39b6h.png/1401555600000.jpg"}, "title": "Senate's odd couple quickly form a voting bloc", "description": "The Abbott government faces a new hurdle in the Senate, with Family First and the Liberal Democratic Party forming a ''voting bloc''.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@smh"}, "robots": "ACAP allow-present prohibited-modification=annotation", "msapplication-tooltip": "Open The Sydney Morning Herald", "fb": {"app_id": 193677504039845}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.smh.com.au", "msapplication-task": "name=Weather;action-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/weather;icon-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/favicon.ico;", "description": "The Abbott government faces a new hurdle in the Senate, with Family First and the Liberal Democratic Party forming a ''voting bloc''."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd933b\"", "article_summary": "Mr Leyonhjelm said he would defer to Mr Day on any industrial relations issue and Mr Day will take his advice on agriculture.\nOn Tuesday, Mr Day and Mr Leyonhjelm delivered speeches to the Centre for Independent Studies.\nHe met Mr Day on Wednesday and sat down in Sydney with Mr Leyonhjelm on Friday.\nAfter the meeting, Mr Leyonhjelm said: ''I quite like the guy, he speaks his mind, a bit like me.''\nWhen it comes to smaller government, Mr Leyonhjelm said: ''I do not draw the line anywhere."}
