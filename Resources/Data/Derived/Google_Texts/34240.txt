“Morning Joe” host Mika Brzezinski sounded the alarm on Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber’s comments about American “stupidity” Wednesday, accusing mainstream news outlets of not covering the story because Gruber is a liberal and apparent ally of the Obama administration.

Gruber has been captured on video from last year claiming that the Affordable Care Act’s passage was made possible by the “lack of transparency” of the law and the “stupidity of the American voter.”

“I’m surprised it didn’t emerge,” Mika said of the story during a segment of “Morning Joe,” labeling Gruber’s remarks “the most serious of gaffes.”

“Nobody covered it except for some right-wing outlets,” she said. “But, if this had been a Republican, what do you think would have happened?”

Mike Barnicle then likened Gruber to David Stockman, Ronald Reagan’s budget director who was criticized in the 1980s for his remarks about White House officials not understanding the budget numbers.

“Just a few left-wing bloggers brought it up, right? It wasn’t covered?” Brzezinski followed. “I think there was a huge firestorm, I believe.”

When Howard Dean answered in the affirmative, Brzezinski shouted, “Exactly, that’s my point!”

Even though Barnicle and Dean attempted to downplay the Gruber incident, Brzezinski pressed on later during the show to suggest that the mainstream media is ignoring the story because Gruber is a liberal.

“That was a huge gaffe, right?” she said. “We can all agree on that. I do think had it been a Republican, the media would be exploding.”
