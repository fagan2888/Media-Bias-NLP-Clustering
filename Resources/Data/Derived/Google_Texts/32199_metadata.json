It doesn\u2019t.\n\nTrump\u2019s filing showed the businessman\u2019s \u201ctremendous cash flow\u201d and was \u201cthe largest in the history of the F.E.C.\u201d his campaign claimed in a news release, referring to the Federal Election Commission.\n\nOn the form, which requires all presidential candidates to disclose the sources of their income and the business entities they own, Trump claims an income of at least $615 million, according to the New York Times with large parts of his income stemming from his sale of the Miss Universe pageant and revenues from his many golf courses.\n\nHe reported assets of at least $1.5 billion, and liabilities of about $315 million, according to the Times.\n\nBut those numbers need to be taken with a hearty grain of salt.\n\nThe F.E.C. form, unlike Trump\u2019s tax return \u2013 which the candidate has so far refused to release \u2013 is only designed to disclose potential conflicts of interest. Only income and revenue matter for that purpose, not business expenses, so the disclosure of those latter figures is optional, an F.E.C. official confirmed to The Real Deal.\n\nIn addition, incomes and company values on the form are given as wide ranges rather than specific figures, such $1 million to $5 million, with the highest range going to infinity (over $5 million, in the case of income).\n\nStill, the forms are audited by the U.S. Office of Government Ethics. Craig Holman, a government affairs lobbyist at the nonprofit Public Citizen, told TRD earlier this year that candidates are expected to \u201cprovide a reasonable estimate of the value [of their assets] and the source of that value.\u201d\n\nTRD analyzed Trump\u2019s brand income \u2013 for which expenses aren\u2019t an issue \u2013 using his previous disclosure filing in its April issue, finding he made between about $9 million and $36 million from his name between January 2014 and June 2015.\n\nIn 2013, TRD undertook a more thorough review of the mogul\u2019s assets around the world.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Donald Trump has long said he\u2019s worth $10 billion, and now claims a new conflict-of-interest disclosure filing proves it.
