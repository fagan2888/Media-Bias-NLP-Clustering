We could not have done it without you. That is why we\u2019re asking for your help again,\u201d the email begins.\n\n\u201cWe are launching a new campaign to clean up Florida\u2019s government and push back against the growing power of the special interests. Only by putting the needs of the people over the desires of the powerful can we fix our broken healthcare system, give all children access to a quality education, and reform an imperfect judicial system. We cannot allow Tallahassee to be overtaken by corruption like Washington, D.C. \u201cWe are ready to lead this revolt from the inside and to make this fight the mission of the Florida House of Representatives. But we can\u2019t do it without you. Please raise your voice and help us spread the word about the need for real change in Tallahassee. Florida deserves a better government and her citizens deserve a better life. If we stand together, we can make that dream a reality.\u201d\n\nThe email links to a YouTube video, with excerpts from Corcoran\u2019s designation acceptance speech from September. He is now Appropriations chair, in charge of planning the House version of the state budget.\n\nThe video starts with a mention of his parents being from the \u201cGreatest Generation,\u201d the term popularized by journalist Tom Brokaw to describe those Americans who grew up in the Great Depression to go on to fight World War II.\n\n\u201cHow do you honor the legacy of all those people who sacrificed so much so that we have this unique opportunity to serve?\u201d he asks. \u201cWe honor them by telling the truth.\u201d\n\nThe video then summarizes his \u201cplatform\u201d from that acceptance speech, focusing on ethics, judicial, education, and health care reforms.\n\n\u201cThat is the truth,\u201d he concludes. \u201cWe can choose to sacrifice our self-interests.\u201d\n\nThe video \u2013 sponsored by Florida Roundtable, a Corcoran-controlled political committee \u2013 leads to a website: Florida Deserves Better. That\u2019s where he highlights his major concerns.\n\nAmong other things, Corcoran, whose brother Michael is a prominent state lobbyist, has called for a ban on any state elected official from lobbying the legislative or executive branch for six years after leaving office.\n\nWith the 2016 Legislative Session set to end in less than a month, however, it\u2019s unclear whether the \u201cmoral suasion\u201d tactic will get House-favored bills through the Senate and to Gov. Rick Scott\u2018s desk.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Florida Politics", "description": "Richard Corcoran, Speaker-designate of the Florida House, already is flexing his political muscles with a call-to-action email\u00a0sent to supporters Monday.
