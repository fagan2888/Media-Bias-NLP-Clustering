You\u2019ve forced actor George Takei to drop the F-bomb in a nonsensical meme.\n\n.@GeorgeTakei I hope that meme at least made you feel better, because it made no sense whatsoever. \u2014 The Storm Crow (@Stormcrow6) July 1, 2014\n\n@GeorgeTakei I love when people like you get mad at rulings like this but when you win you tell us to shut up and deal with it. #hypocrite \u2014 Hokie Hunter (@Hokiehunter13) July 1, 2014\n\n@GeorgeTakei ya know what George? I support Gay Rights & believe in freedoms. Thought you did too. But that means supporting ALL freedom. \u2014 NOTDaleJR88 (@NOTDaleJR88) July 1, 2014\n\nThat \u201cf**king crafts store\u201d also drove Takei to blog about \u201chow the U.S Supreme Court believes corporations are people, yet treats women inhumanely.\u201d\n\nInhumanely.\n\nHe trots out everything from Scientology to Sharia Law in his quest to portray Hobby Lobby as a company that \u201ccan refuse to provide insurance covering contraception to its female employees.\u201d (Never mind the 16 types of birth control Hobby Lobby covers. Reading is hard.)\n\nTakei also calls for a boycott and tells all you ladies what you should do. Because he knows best so pipe down and do as you\u2019re told.\n\nThe only way such companies ever learn to treat people with decency and tolerance is to hit them where it counts\u2013in their pocketbooks. I won\u2019t be shopping there, and women everywhere should exercise their right of protest and refuse to shop there as well.\n\nHey, feminists, isn\u2019t this the part where you call him out for \u201cmansplaining\u201d and infantilizing women by telling them what to do?\n\nChirp. Chirp. Chirp.\n\nRelated:\n\nSupreme Court sides with Hobby Lobby in landmark religious freedom case", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "title": "Rest easy, ladies: George Takei will do your Hobby Lobby thinking for you [pic] - twitchy.com", "og": {"site_name": "twitchy.com", "description": "Hey, feminists, this is the part where Takei gets called out for \"mansplaining,\" right?", "title": "Rest easy, ladies: George Takei will do your Hobby Lobby thinking for you [pic] - twitchy.com", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://twitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/women-know-your-place.png", "url": "http://twitchy.com/jennqpublic-3135/2014/07/01/rest-easy-ladies-george-takei-will-do-your-hobby-lobby-thinking-for-you-pic/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "twitchy.com", "title": "Rest easy, ladies: George Takei will do your Hobby Lobby thinking for you [pic] - twitchy.com", "image": "http://twitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/women-know-your-place.png", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Hey, feminists, this is the part where Takei gets called out for \"mansplaining,\" right?"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://twitchy.com/wp-content/themes/twitchy2016/images/favicon/smalltile.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://twitchy.com/wp-content/themes/twitchy2016/images/favicon/largetile.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://twitchy.com/wp-content/themes/twitchy2016/images/favicon/widetile.png", "article": {"section": "Entertainment", "tag": "Supreme Court", "published_time": "2014-07-01T15:00:46+00:00"}, "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://twitchy.com/wp-content/themes/twitchy2016/images/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde788\"", "article_summary": "You\u2019ve forced actor George Takei to drop the F-bomb in a nonsensical meme.\nNow you\u2019ve done it, Hobby Lobby.\nHe trots out everything from Scientology to Sharia Law in his quest to portray Hobby Lobby as a company that \u201ccan refuse to provide insurance covering contraception to its female employees.\u201d (Never mind the 16 types of birth control Hobby Lobby covers.\nRelated:Supreme Court sides with Hobby Lobby in landmark religious freedom case\n\u2014 NOTDaleJR88 (@NOTDaleJR88) July 1, 2014That \u201cf**king crafts store\u201d also drove Takei to blog about \u201chow the U.S Supreme Court believes corporations are people, yet treats women inhumanely.\u201dInhumanely."}
