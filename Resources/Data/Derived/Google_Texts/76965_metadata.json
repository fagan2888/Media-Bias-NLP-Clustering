There are many reasons for this, including the fact that talk-show hosts and movie stars (just for instance) aren\u2019t necessarily the best people to bring nuance or thoughtfulness or clarity to these conversations. An even bigger reason may be that religion in general, and fundamentalist religion in particular, is a major sore spot in Western culture, a source of tremendous vulnerability and anxiety.\n\nOne of the few propositions that Reza Aslan and Sam Harris might both agree with is that God\u2019s return to the world-historical stage long after Nietzsche supposedly killed him off, as both an internal and external enemy of the Western secular-capitalist order, is a dangerous phenomenon for which our society has no clear answer. Our exaggerated response to ISIS is a dead giveaway: They may be a stateless desert army of bloodthirsty nutjobs, but they have something we lost a long time ago and can\u2019t get back.\n\nFundamentalist Christianity appeared to be on a long, slow decline in the United States. Now right-wing Christians have mounted a vigorous counterattack against reproductive rights, largely by cloaking themselves (ingeniously, it must be said) in pseudo-liberal sheep\u2019s clothing, as an oppressed and disenfranchised group entitled to legal protection. Similarly, fundamentalist Islam seemed to be on the run in the Middle East, although that required the expenditure of trillions of dollars, hundreds of thousands of human lives and the last reservoir of goodwill toward America in the Arab world. Then came the rollout of ISIS, with its genocidal mass killings and its beheading videos: an al-Qaida 2.0 for the YouTube age, with better graphics and an even more deranged vision.\n\nISIS is scary, all right, and despite President Obama\u2019s claim that the Islamic State is neither Islamic nor a state, the group\u2019s extreme version of religious orthodoxy is clearly an important part of its allure. But when a radical militia group waving a flaming ideological sword has successfully lured the major Western powers into yet another self-destructive Middle East war, it\u2019s legitimate to wonder who is behaving rationally and who has lost their minds. Religion is driving us crazy, and the disorder is by no means limited to believers.\n\nI want to focus on Harris, the neuroscientist and \u201cNew Atheist\u201d philosopher, because he\u2019s a fascinating and troublesome figure who embodies many of these contradictions. His premise that the primary role of religion in human history has been as \u201cfailed science\u201d \u2013 as a set of factual claims about the universe that have now been proven false (or are inherently unfalsifiable) \u2013 lies at the core of his atheist worldview. It\u2019s also dramatically at odds with the standard view in religious studies, and would provoke eye-rolling from a sophomore seminar in the subject. At best, it\u2019s a partial account of one of the roles filled by religion, and an account that ignores overwhelming evidence that believers interpret religious doctrine and scripture different ways in different contexts. Did the ancient Greeks literally believe that Zeus and Athena and Apollo lived in palaces on top of Mt. Olympus? It would take a sociologist with a time machine to supply a definitive answer, but the best available evidence suggests a situation we ought to recognize: Some did, some did not and a great many weren\u2019t sure or hadn\u2019t really thought about it.\n\nOn the other hand, Harris\u2019 belief that reason and science can (or someday will) supply a transcendent, religion-like experience that satisfies the human yearning for spirituality, while relinquishing all claims to metaphysical truth, is almost charming. That\u2019s an article of faith if I\u2019ve ever heard one, and one that rests on what St. Augustine would have described as a theological heresy \u2013 a misguided faith in the perfectibility of man in this fallen world. There is something noble about Harris\u2019 efforts to bridge the gap between science and philosophy, and also something severely na\u00efve in his declaration that in the age of astrophysics we no longer need God. To phrase Augustine\u2019s response in modern terms, what we know about human psychology to this point suggests that as a species we favor storytelling over facts, and that we do not draw much distinction between stories that are true, those that are metaphorically true and those that feel true but are entirely false.\n\nIndeed, I would argue that people who line up on opposing sides of the Harris-Aslan feud over religion and Islam represent fundamentally different worldviews, in ways they themselves may not recognize. I\u2019m not talking about East vs. West or Muslim vs. Christian, and still less about lily-livered p.c. \u201cprogressives\u201d vs. courageous contrarian truth-tellers, or however Bill Maher would like to phrase it. And I don\u2019t precisely mean the difference between people of faith and the atheistic or irreligious. Those are facets of the dispute that are largely obvious. In a conversation between Richard Dawkins and Pope Francis (and I\u2019d definitely pay to watch that), both would politely acknowledge that they hold divergent views about the fundamental nature of reality. What I really mean is the difference between humanities majors and science majors.\n\nThat may sound like crude or facetious shorthand, but I believe it contains a genuine insight. Given that I clearly belong to one of these tribes (you get only one guess), it\u2019s entirely likely that I will mischaracterize the other one. Such is the nature of the epistemological division. When I say that one side is primarily concerned with facts and the other with narrative, or that one side understands the world primarily in subjective, experiential and relativistic terms while the other focuses on objective and quantifiable phenomena and binary true-false questions, that may help us frame the profound mutual misunderstanding at work. Harris\u2019 conception of religion as bad science, which seems like a ludicrous misreading to those who understand religion as a mythic force that shapes community and collective meaning, is a classic example. One side insists that the only important question is whether the truth-claims of religion are actually true; the other side says that question doesn\u2019t even matter, and then wonders what \u201ctruth\u201d is, anyway. It\u2019s the overly literal-minded versus the hopelessly vague.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The debate raging in American culture boils down to an even simpler divide than you think", "title": "Atheism, Islam and liberalism: This is what we are really fighting about", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The debate raging in American culture boils down to an even simpler divide than you think", "title": "Atheism, Islam and liberalism: This is what we are really fighting about", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/10/11/atheism_islam_and_liberalism_this_is_what_we_are_really_fighting_about/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/10/affleck_maher_harris2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The debate raging in American culture boils down to an even simpler divide than you think", "title": "Atheism, Islam and liberalism: This is what we are really fighting about", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/10/affleck_maher_harris2.jpg", "creator": "@andohehir", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Andrew O'Hehir", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Atheism, Ben Affleck, Bill Maher, Editor's Picks, Islam, Islamophobia, muslim, Muslims, New Atheism, Religion, Sam Harris", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcd5d\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Atheism, Ben Affleck, Bill Maher, Editor's Picks, Islam, Islamophobia, muslim, Muslims, New Atheism, Religion, Sam Harris, Entertainment News, Politics NewsHere\u2019s a news flash: None of these heated public debates about atheism and religion, or about how Western \u201cliberals\u201d should think about Islam, ever reach a satisfactory conclusion.\nI\u2019m not talking about East vs. West or Muslim vs. Christian, and still less about lily-livered p.c.\nIndeed, I would argue that people who line up on opposing sides of the Harris-Aslan feud over religion and Islam represent fundamentally different worldviews, in ways they themselves may not recognize.\nWhat I really mean is the difference between humanities majors and science majors.\nDid the ancient Greeks literally believe that Zeus and Athena and Apollo lived in palaces on top of Mt."}
