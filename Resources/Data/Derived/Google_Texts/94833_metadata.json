That marks the first time the union has conferred formally with executives under Volkswagen\u2019s new \u201cengagement\u201d policy modeled on European-style works councils. An auditor recently confirmed that Local 42 had the support of at least 45 percent of the plant\u2019s workforce. (In early 2014, you may recall, Local 42 lost a closely-watched union representation vote.)\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nCantrell also said Local 42 will hold a bargaining committee election this Sunday. \u201cWe will eventually get recognition, and we will eventually bargain a contract,\u201d Cantrell said.\n\nNLRB FAULTS MACY\u2019S FOR FAILING TO BARGAIN WITH MICRO-UNIT \u2014 The National Labor Relations Board ruled that Macy\u2019s can\u2019t re-litigate its opposition to bargaining with a so-called \u201cmicro\u201d bargaining unit of fragrance department workers at a company store in Massachusetts.\n\nIn July, the NLRB, in a 3-1 decision, certified the unit of 41 Macy\u2019s employees organized by Local 1445 of the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union. That decision extended a standard it had previously applied to the healthcare industry, allowing smaller units within retail stores to organize. Macy\u2019s and business groups hated the decision. The company told Reuters at the time that \"organizing a selected portion of a store's selling associates into multiple collective bargaining units is impractical and an impediment to providing a consistent level of customer service.\u201d\n\nAfter July\u2019s decision, however, Macy\u2019s wouldn\u2019t bargain with the unit and eventually faced unfair labor practices charges. In those proceedings, the company acknowledged its failure to bargain but, in so doing, contested the validity of the micro unit. But the board found yesterday that the company is barred from re-litigating that issue, ordering Macy\u2019s to bargain in good faith with the unit.\n\n\u201cAll representation issues raised by the respondent were or could have been litigated in the prior representation proceeding,\u201d the opinion said.

The first will be in Iowa this spring.\n\nOther wage summit highlights:\n\nWarren blasts both parties: \u201cPretty much the whole Republican Party and \u2014 if we\u2019re going to be honest \u2014 too many Democrats are overly cozy with the financial industry, and make decisions that benefit the wealthiest 10 percent of Americans while leaving others to struggle,\u201d Sen. Elizabeth Warren told the audience. \u201cWe know that democracy does not work when congressmen and regulators bow down to Wall Street\u2019s political power,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that means it\u2019s time to break up the Wall Street banks and remind politicians they don\u2019t work for the big banks; they work for us.\u201d Read more from POLITICO\u2019s Kyle Cheney: http://politi.co/1yBOnCX\n\nWalmart worker speaks: \u201cSomebody\u2019s going to have to take a risk,\u201d said Colby Harris, a former Walmart worker fired for participating in a strike against the company. \u201cAnd I feel like me losing my job was just part of that process \u2026 there are several people from several different demographics, several different jobs, Walmart and Papa John\u2019s and low wage jobs, who were all suffering just like I was. But somebody had to take the sacrifice, just like in the 60\u2019s in the civil rights movement.\u201d\n\nMORE NLRB: An NLRB administrative law judge ruled yesterday that the Detroit-based utility company DTE Energy did not violate federal labor law in interrogating an employee about an alleged harassment. Separately, another NLRB administrative law judge found that Longy School of Music of Bard College violated federal labor law when it notified some employees that their employment was \u201cat will\u201d even though a governing union contact said otherwise.\n\nVOTE TODAY OVER ACA AND THE WORK WEEK: The House today will vote on a bill ( Save American Workers Act of 2015,) re-defining full-time employment as 40 hours per week under the Affordable Care Act. The healthcare law currently defines a full-time employer as any worker employed for 30 hours or more. That definition was designed by Democrats to expand coverage and discourage employers from reducing worker hours to avoid the law\u2019s health insurance mandate. But it drew the wrath of businesses and Republicans like Congressman Todd Young of Indiana, who introduced the legislation, with some Democratic support, claiming the shortened work-week definition puts workers \u201cat risk for seeing lost hours and wages at work. \u201c\n\nSEIU International President Mary Kay Henry spoke out against the legislation. In a statement, Henry said the bill would put 6.5 million workers at risk for part-timing and \u201cwould make it easier for bad actor employers to manipulate the work hours of working women and men, depriving them of both benefits and wages.\u201d\n\nFAIRPOINT IN MEDIATION WITH STRIKERS: The International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW), the Communication Workers of America (CWA) and FairPoint Communications Inc. have yet to reach a compromise following intervention from the U.S. Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS). The FMCS announced Jan. 3 that it would mediate the dispute.\n\nNeither side may provide public comment about the process during mediation, which, ideally, will settle a contract dispute that began last year and resulted in more than 1,700 workers walking off the job in October. The two sides began negotiating a new contract in April but reached an impasse in August, according to FairPoint. The contract dispute centers around freezing pensions, reducing health care benefits, and hiring contractors. This is not the first time the FMCS has entered the mediation dispute; in November it requested a meeting between the two sides. No compromise was reached then. http://goo.gl/A7sCAz\n\nBIZ GROUPS ASK COURT FOR ANOTHER DELAY OF HOME HEALTH RULE \u2014 The Home Care Association of America asked a Washington, D.C. federal judge last night to delay another key portion of the Labor department\u2019s overtime and minimum wage rules for home health workers. The same court last month nixed a major portion of the law, allowing certain third party providers of home health workers to continue to avoid paying workers minimum wage and overtime. If successful, this latest challenge would deal another blow to the Labor department\u2019s bid to extend greater overtime protections to the home health care industry.\n\nThe portion of the rule under attack is complicated, but essentially it narrows the definition of \u201ccompanionship services\u201d (which are exempt) in such a way as to extend minimum wage protection to many workers not previously not covered who feed and clean the elderly or disabled. DOL says Congress intended to limit the companionship exemption to less active workers (\u201celdersitters\u201d).\n\nThe HCAA isn\u2019t buying it. \u201cCongress did not express any intent to restrict the companionship exemption to those few workers who only \u2018incidentally\u2019 care for the elderly and infirm,\u201d the HCAA told the court last night. The court has temporarily delayed implementation of the rule until Jan. 15, but it\u2019s considering a longer stay. The DOL, at any rate, already stalled enforcement of the rule until July.

In the past two years, they collectively have added thousands of contingent faculty to their membership rolls. Their efforts may get a boost from a recent National Labor Relations Board ruling that creates the most favorable conditions for faculty organizing in three decades.\u201d http://politico.pro/1tMMpJc\n\nCOFFEE BREAK\n\n\u2014 Senate Democrats in Indiana propose $10.10 minimum wage, from the A.P.: http://bit.ly/1DzJQ2S\n\n\u2014 Kentucky Senate puts right-to-work bill on fast track, from Kentucky.com: http://bit.ly/1Itw2I8\n\n\u2014 Obama sells success in Detroit trip, from POLITICO: http://politi.co/1AHcOhF\n\n\u2014 Republicans in Wisconsin slow down right-to-work push, from La Crosse Tribune: http://bit.ly/1FpCqnF\n\n\u2014 State courts may offer workers better chance at litigating pay for security checks, from Bloomberg Businessweek: http://buswk.co/1Atp97O\n\n\u2014 Door opens for Teamsters to organize Southern California port drivers, from San Jose Mercury-News: http://bit.ly/1BJtZxc\n\n\u2014 Teen retailer laying off 3,700, from the Wall Street Journal: http://on.wsj.com/14qC3bg\n\n\u2014 Showdown looms between business and labor, from Al-Jazeera: http://alj.am/14wOpj0\n\n\u2014 United Attendants protest firing after they refused to board \u201cmenacing\u201d jet, from Bloomberg: http://bloom.bg/1AtpE4i\n\n\u2014 \u201cThe $140,000-a-year welding job,\u201d from the Wall Street Journal: http://on.wsj.com/1BNL6Oz\n\nTHAT\u2019S ALL FOR MORNING SHIFT.
