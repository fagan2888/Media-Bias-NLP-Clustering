He just said \u2018Hi,\u2019\u201d the neighbor asked.\n\nThe McAdamses\u2019 reaction was because Ean has autism and is largely nonverbal. This was the first time Ean had ever greeted his father like this.\n\nSince Ean was 20 months old, he has been in a type of therapy called applied behavior analysis. His parents say it is integral to his development and to thank for these small moments of celebration.\n\nThe goals of applied behavior analysis are to shape and reinforce new behaviors, such as learning to speak and play, and reduce undesirable ones, according to the National Institute of Mental Health. The therapy can involve intensive, one-on-one child-teacher interaction for up to 40 hours a week and has inspired the development of other, similar interventions that aim to help those with autism spectrum disorder reach their full potential, according to the institute.\n\nBut the McAdamses have run into a challenge that other Oklahoma families of children with autism face: Applied behavior analysis is not covered by most health insurance providers.\n\nThis is why the McAdamses plan to move to Texas at the end of the year, a state that requires insurance companies to cover applied behavior analysis, among other types of therapies for children with autism.\n\nA parity law\n\nAutism advocates have tried \u2014 and plan to continue trying \u2014 to pass the same law in Oklahoma. Oklahoma has a law regarding autism, but it is essentially a parity law, requiring insurance companies to cover autism like they would other disorders.\n\nMeanwhile, opponents of mandated coverage say that applied behavior analysis is an educational, not physical health, therapy, and it should be provided outside the realm of private health insurance. They also raise concerns about how costly the therapy is and the impact it could have on premium costs.\n\nApplied behavior therapy can cost $10,000 a month, on average, although it ranges, depending on the child\u2019s need and his or her treatment regime.\n\nIan Santus, regional director at ACI Learning Centers, which provides applied behavior therapy in centers in Oklahoma, Texas, Colorado and Kansas, said people should consider how much it will cost if these children don\u2019t receive the care they need.\n\n\u201cI think, unfortunately, a lot of people look at that number, and it\u2019s scary to them and I totally understand that,\u201d Santus said.\n\n\u201cBut the numbers I think are more important are \u2014 what happens if that child doesn\u2019t receive therapy? What happens when that child is 10 and 15 and big and able to hurt other people, or is 20 and isn\u2019t working and requires assisted living or group therapy or a state facility? What kinds of cost are we looking at for that child at that point? Not to mention the major opportunity costs because that child is 20 years old and doesn\u2019t have life skills to live on their own.\u201d\n\nJudith Ursitti, director of state government affairs at Autism Speaks, a research and advocacy organization, said this argument has resonated in conservative states like Texas, Georgia and South Carolina.\n\nUrsitti advocated with other families in Texas after she was told by her insurance company that treatment for autism for her son, Jack, would not be covered.\n\nOver the past eight years, Texas has passed and updated its law to not only mandate coverage for children with autism but also includes applied behavior therapy and doesn\u2019t include an age cap.\n\n\u201cTexas is a very conservative, business friendly state, a very similar environment to Oklahoma, but they put their toe in the water, and they went back and expanded and expanded, and the reason they\u2019ve been able to do that is because the fears they had around cost did not come to fruition,\u201d Ursitti said.\n\nReinforced learning\n\nEan goes to Therapy and Beyond in Tulsa, where he receives individual applied behavior analysis therapy. When the family moves, Ean will go to a Therapy and Beyond location in the Dallas metro area.\n\nMelody McAdams said since Ean has been through the therapy, he has learned to use silverware, is almost potty trained, can drink through a straw and can communicate using a sheet with photographs of different things he wants.\n\nOn a recent afternoon, Melody McAdams held the sheet, and Ean pointed to a potato chip.\n\n\u201cLook me in the eye,\u201d she requested.\n\nEan looked up at her. She rewarded him with a chip.\n\nThese are the types of things that Melody and Christian McAdams have learned to do to reinforce what Ean learns at Therapy and Beyond.\n\nResearch has shown that intensive behavioral therapy during the toddler or preschool years can significantly improve cognitive and language skills in young children with autism spectrum disorder, according to the National Institute of Mental Health. There is no single best treatment for all children with autism.\n\nApplied behavior analysis is a \u201cwidely accepted treatment\u201d for autism, the institute reports.\n\nBonnie McBride, associate pediatrics professor at the University of Oklahoma College of Medicine, said applied behavior analysis might not be the only type of treatment a child with autism receives, but these types of interventions should be part of their care.\n\n\u201cDo we know everything as an exact science?\u201d McBride said. \u201cAbsolutely not. We have a lot to learn still, but I would say it\u2019s safe to say, and I feel confident saying this \u2014 that behavioral intervention should be a part of every kid\u2019s treatment plan.\u201d\n\nChildren with autism can have significant and challenging behaviors, such as frequent meltdowns and aggression toward others or themselves, McBride said.\n\nThese types of therapies focus on shaping positive behaviors.\n\nFor example, certain techniques focus on developing a child\u2019s verbal behavior, helping them go from simple verbal behaviors, such as echoing, to more functional communication skills through techniques such as prompting the child with cue cards and other tools, according to the National Institute of Mental Health.\n\nMcBride said more and more research is pointing to the benefits that can be seen in children who receive applied behavior analysis.\n\n\u201c85 years ago, I couldn\u2019t have stated this as strongly, but now applied behavior analysis is certainly one, if not the only, efficacious intervention or treatment for autism, and while it\u2019s not the only intervention that a particular child might need, it certainly should be part of their intervention program,\u201d McBride said.\n\nNot developing\n\nIn April, the McAdamses ran into problems with their health insurance coverage for Ean\u2019s care.\n\nFor the first two years of Ean\u2019s life, the family lived in California. Christian McAdams, 27, was in the Marines for four years as a computer networker.\n\nThe couple started to notice when Ean was almost 2 that he seemed like he wasn\u2019t developing as quickly as he should be.\n\nMelody McAdams took Ean to a developmental pediatrician, and she expected him to tell her that Ean, who was 20 months old at the time, was a little delayed. She didn\u2019t think she would leave with a diagnosis.\n\n\u201cYour suspicions were correct,\u201d the doctor told her. \u201cHe has autism.\u201d\n\nShe started to cry as the doctor started to explain applied behavioral analysis and insurance coverage and more of what she needed to know.\n\n\u201cStop talking,\u201d Melody told him. It was too much, too soon.\n\n\u201cAt that moment, I realized he may never graduate high school. He may never get married. He may never have kids. He may never be able to live independently,\u201d she said. \u201cIt just hit me like that.\u201d\n\nShortly thereafter, Ean started therapy, including applied behavior analysis. At that time, their insurance in California fully covered the care.\n\nAnd even when they moved to Oklahoma, their United Healthcare plan covered applied behavior analysis for about seven months.\n\nBut in April, Therapy and Beyond notified the McAdams and several other families that the insurance company had told the school they would no longer reimburse them for the therapy.\n\nEllen Laden, a UnitedHealthOne spokeswoman, said the company\u2019s 2015 health insurance plans available outside of the health insurance marketplace, the federally run HealthCare.gov site, provide coverage for autism as required by the Affordable Care Act.\n\nBut coverage for specific services, like applied behavior analysis, are based off the laws and policies of each state.\n\n\u201cAll services are required to be medically necessary as defined by the customer\u2019s plan, and all other insurance plan provisions apply,\u201d Laden said in an email. \u201cBecause we originally provided incorrect information to Mr. and Mrs. McAdams about the services covered by the plan they chose for their son Ean, we made the decision to honor our commitment to the family and provide coverage for ABA therapy for the rest of 2015 as long as Ean\u2019s health insurance plan remains in force.\u201d\n\nFor the most part, health insurance companies in Oklahoma do not cover applied behavior analysis therapy, including Blue Cross Blue Shield of Oklahoma, the largest health insurance provider in the state.\n\nDr. Joseph Cunningham, the company\u2019s chief medical officer, said in an email statement that Blue Cross does provide an autism benefit for fully insured group health plans.\n\nThe autism benefit is part of the company\u2019s standard group health plans and includes \u201ccertain autism-related medically necessary services,\u201d including evaluation and management procedures, occupational therapy, physical therapy and speech therapy visits for children younger than 6 with an autism diagnosis.\n\nThere is generally no limit on the number of visits per year a child under 6 can receive, Cunningham said.\n\nThis excludes some grandfathered plans that don\u2019t fall under the Affordable Care Act\u2019s regulations on care and some self-funded plans.\n\nMeanwhile, children ages 6 and older have regular medical benefits that include standard limits of a 25-combined maximum for occupational therapy, physical therapy and speech therapy visits per year.\n\n\u201cBlue Cross Blue Shield of Oklahoma supports evidence-based medicine, which uses the best current scientific evidence to help make decisions about the care and treatment of a patient,\u201d Cunningham said. \u201cExperimental and investigational treatments usually are not covered by health care plans, due to the lack of medical or scientific evidence supporting the safety and effectiveness of these treatments. Applied behavior analysis lacks pertinent medical and scientific research that Blue Cross Blue Shield of Oklahoma requires for its benefit plans. While health insurance benefits provide coverage for medical treatments, applied behavior analysis programs are considered to be behavioral and educational training, not medical treatment.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Council for Affordable Health Insurance, which advocates for insurance carriers, argues that private health insurance doesn\u2019t provide consistent care that children with autism need.\n\n\u201cIf legislators want to help these families, they should create programs specifically targeted to meet their needs and properly fund them from general revenues \u2014 better than Congress did under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act program \u2014 rather than try to force the costs onto health insurance, which will just increase everyone\u2019s premiums,\u201d the organization wrote in a policy paper about mandated coverage.\n\nDecision to move\n\nIn November or December, the McAdamses will move to Carrollton, Texas, a suburb of Dallas.\n\nThe McAdamses are hopeful that moving to Texas will mean having access to quality, consistent therapy for Ean that\u2019s covered by insurance.\n\nMelody McAdams works as a server and will transfer to a restaurant in the Fort Worth area. Christian McAdams is an electrician and plans to work in construction.\n\nThe decision to move has been hard on Melody\u2019s family. The couple and their young son have only been back from California living in Oklahoma for a year.\n\nBut this move is for Ean. The loan money they were going to use to buy a house in the Tulsa area will now go to pay for their move. Christian McAdams had planned to go back to school to study engineering. That will wait.\n\n\u201cWe had to put a hold on a lot of things, making sure (Ean) get everything he needs first,\u201d Christian McAdams said.\n\nAdvocates have told the family it will take a few years to change Oklahoma\u2019s laws, if they\u2019re successful. But the McAdamses say they can\u2019t wait for that.\n\nMelody McAdams had envisioned the family staying there, near her family.\n\nBut that plan didn\u2019t work out. And over the past three years, she has learned that sometimes it\u2019s best to take one day at a time.\n\n\u201cI told myself ... \u2018We\u2019re not going to worry about graduating high school. We\u2019re not going to worry about if he\u2019s going to have kids,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to worry about if he\u2019s going to go to applied behavioral analysis today. What\u2019s he going to eat today? Did we make it to the toilet on time? And then tomorrow, we\u2019ll start all over again. Literally, living day by day, instead of thinking to the future. Of course, we\u2019re trying to plan for the future. That\u2019s why we\u2019re doing this.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The McAdamses of Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, have run into a challenge that other Oklahoma families of children with autism face: Applied behavior analysis is not covered by most health insurance providers.", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 NewsOK.com.
