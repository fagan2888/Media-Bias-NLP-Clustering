Guy has written extensively about the looming premium hikes for health care plans under Obamacare, which has reached a point where Americans see paying the tax to remain uninsured as cheaper than enrolling for insurance (via NYT):\n\n[\u2026]\n\n\u2026[P]lenty of healthy holdouts remain, and their resistance helps explain why insurers are worried about the financial viability of the exchanges over time. They say they sorely need more healthy customers to balance out the costs of covering the sicker, older people who have flocked to exchange plans.\n\n[\u2026]\n\nMany holdouts have made their decisions after meticulously comparing the cost of insurance premiums and deductibles with paying for doctor appointments, lab tests and prescriptions themselves. For some healthy people, the combined cost of premiums and deductibles, which can exceed $10,000, makes the penalty seem a better deal.\n\nFor 2016 and beyond, the penalty will be $695 per adult or 2.5 percent of household income, up from $325 per adult or 2 percent of household income last year.\n\nSusan Reardon, 61, of Kalamazoo, Mich., said she was leaning toward going uninsured this year. She calculated that she would have to spend more than $12,000, including premiums of nearly $500 a month and a $6,850 deductible, to get anything beyond preventive benefits from the cheapest exchange plan available to her.\n\nMs. Reardon, whose husband is old enough to be covered by Medicare, said she would rather pay out of pocket for the drugs she takes for fibromyalgia and the handful of doctor appointments she tends to need each year.\n\nIf something catastrophic happens, she said, \u201cI feel like it\u2019s better just to die.\u201d\n\nAs for the tax penalty, which could approach $1,500 for her?\n\n\u201cCome and get me,\u201d Ms. Reardon said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "I feel like it's better just to die..05/26/2016 19:02:33PM EST.", "author": "Matt Vespa", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "I feel like it's better just to die.", "title": "ICYMI: Obamacare Is So Great Americans Are Paying To Remain Uninsured Because It's Cheaper", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2016/01/14/obamacare-so-great-that-americans-are-paying-to-be-uninsured-because-its-cheaper-n2099929", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/13/2016-01-13T214151Z_1_LYNXNPEC0C1CU_RTROPTP_3_USA-OBAMA.JPG", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "I feel like it's better just to die.", "title": "ICYMI: Obamacare Is So Great Americans Are Paying To Remain Uninsured Because It's Cheaper", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2016/01/14/obamacare-so-great-that-americans-are-paying-to-be-uninsured-because-its-cheaper-n2099929", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/13/2016-01-13T214151Z_1_LYNXNPEC0C1CU_RTROPTP_3_USA-OBAMA.JPG", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "ICYMI: Obamacare Is So Great Americans Are Paying To Remain Uninsured Because It's Cheaper , Matt Vespa, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "If something catastrophic happens, she said, \u201cI feel like it\u2019s better just to die.\u201dAs for the tax penalty, which could approach $1,500 for her?\n[\u2026]Many holdouts have made their decisions after meticulously comparing the cost of insurance premiums and deductibles with paying for doctor appointments, lab tests and prescriptions themselves.\nThey say they sorely need more healthy customers to balance out the costs of covering the sicker, older people who have flocked to exchange plans.\nSusan Reardon, 61, of Kalamazoo, Mich., said she was leaning toward going uninsured this year.\nFor some healthy people, the combined cost of premiums and deductibles, which can exceed $10,000, makes the penalty seem a better deal."}
