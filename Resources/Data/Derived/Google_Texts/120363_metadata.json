These survivors are showing us that life after cancer can be meaningful, exciting, and filled with joy.\u201d\n\nThanks to improved cancer treatments, more people are surviving after being diagnosed with cancer. But it\u2019s often difficult to return to normal lives after undergoing chemotherapy, when every small ounce of energy was focused on simply getting through each day. \u201cWhile I was having chemo, I quit doing almost everything,\u201d Len, a cancer patient, told the National Cancer Institute (NCI). \u201cSo when treatment ended, the challenge for me was, what am I going to do now with my life? What should I go back to doing?\u201d\n\nThough the immediate fight against cancer might be over once treatment is over, many patients realize that it\u2019s not the end of the battle. Taking the time to recover is important. Survivors may discover that doing things they once used to do isn\u2019t quite as easy as it was before, or they may be concerned that the cancer might return. But in addition to these changes, survivors also find a new way of looking at life, where small things hold more meaning. \u201cAfter treatment for breast cancer, I knew my life had changed forever. Nothing could ever be the same. I was very sad at my losses, but I felt I had been given the gift of a new life,\u201d one cancer survivor, Linda, told the NCI.\n\nSurviving cancer may spur you into choosing a healthier lifestyle, consisting of working out more, eating more healthily, and stopping the bad habits that might have led to cancer to begin with, like smoking. The National Cancer Institute lists an extensive plan for cancer survivors, to help them deal with follow-up medical care, the physical and emotional changes, as well as learning how to cope with a different life afterwards. There are even support groups for survivors that help people deal better with anxieties about the future, or even post-chemo physical symptoms like fatigue.\n\n\u201cNational Cancer Survivors Day is an opportunity for cancer survivors to come together and celebrate this new reality in cancer survivorship,\u201d Shipp said. \u201cThere is life after cancer. It may not be the same as before cancer, but it can be beautiful, rewarding, and sometimes even better than before. And that\u2019s something to celebrate.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "national cancer survivor day, cancer survivors", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "National Cancer Survivor Day is meant to bring together all the cancer survivors in the world to celebrate their new lives after treatment.", "title": "National Cancer Survivor Day Reminds Us That Life After Cancer Isn't Lost", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/national-cancer-survivor-day-2014-reminder-life-after-cancer-can-be-healthy-meaningful-285760", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/05/31/cancer-survivor.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "National Cancer Survivor Day is meant to bring together all the cancer survivors in the world to celebrate their new lives after treatment.", "title": "National Cancer Survivor Day Reminds Us That Life After Cancer Isn't Lost", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/national-cancer-survivor-day-2014-reminder-life-after-cancer-can-be-healthy-meaningful-285760", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/05/31/cancer-survivor.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/05/31/cancer-survivor.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-06-01T08:00:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-01T08:02:03-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "National Cancer Survivor Day is meant to bring together all the cancer survivors in the world to celebrate their new lives after treatment."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3a54\"", "article_summary": "\u201cNational Cancer Survivors Day is an opportunity for cancer survivors to come together and celebrate this new reality in cancer survivorship,\u201d Shipp said.\nJune 1 is the 27th annual National Cancer Survivor Day, established as a reminder that quality of life after cancer is better than ever before.\n\u201cSometimes people have very negative ideas of what life after cancer looks like,\u201d the National Cancer Survivors Day Foundation spokesperson, Laura Shipp, told CBS 5.\n\u201cWhile I was having chemo, I quit doing almost everything,\u201d Len, a cancer patient, told the National Cancer Institute (NCI).\nThere is life after a cancer diagnosis, and it's something to celebrate, especially among the 14 million cancer survivors in the U.S."}
