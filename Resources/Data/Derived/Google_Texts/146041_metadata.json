Healthcare.gov, the troubled online insurance market created by the Affordable Care Act\u2014a.k.a. Obamacare\u2014will begin accepting enrollees, as will the 14 state-run insurance exchanges.\n\nThis year the government opened the federal site for window shopping in advance, so you\u2019ve been able to get a sneak peek at what\u2019s available in your area before the formal sign-up process kicks off this weekend. Although experts can\u2019t promise that open enrollment will run smoothly this go-around, they do think the process will face fewer problems.\n\n\n\nIf you bought insurance last year, you may figure that you don\u2019t need to do anything in year two. Or if you went without last year, perhaps you plan to do the same. Not so fast. Read this before you make any health-care shopping decisions.\n\nSkipping Insurance Will Cost You More\n\nIf you decided to go without health insurance in 2014, you\u2019ll likely get hit with a penalty when you file your income taxes this April. It\u2019ll be the greater of $95 for an adult ($285 per family) or 1% of family income.\n\nBut going without insurance in 2015 will cost you even more. For the 2015 plan year you\u2019ll owe the greater of $325 for an adult ($975 per family) or 2% of family income, which you\u2019ll pay with your taxes in spring 2016.\n\nYou may qualify for an exemption if the lowest-cost plan in your area would cost you more than 8% of your income, or if you went without insurance for fewer than three months.\n\nEven If You Enrolled Last Year, You Should Shop Around Again\n\nBy now you should have received a notice from your current health plan explaining that your coverage will end December 31. You\u2019ll also be told whether the insurer will offer that same plan in 2015 and, if so, what it will cost and how it will change, says Karen Pollitz, a senior fellow at the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nIf you signed up for coverage last year, or even just a month or two ago, you may think you\u2019re all set. Why go through what was likely a taxing experience, given the technical problems the exchanges had last year? Here\u2019s why.\n\nFirst, there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ll have different plans to choose from this year. Some insurers will exit the marketplaces, but many others have joined. In 35 states, the number of insurance companies offering coverage on a state exchange is increasing, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation; only two states, California and Oregon, will see a slight decline. New Hampshire, which had one insurer participate in its exchange in 2014, is adding four new insurers for 2015. In Ohio, you\u2019ll find five new insurers, and four in Pennsylvania.\n\nPremiums are also changing. An early analysis of monthly plan costs across 15 cities found that the premium for the second-lowest-cost silver plan, before taking any income-based tax credits into account, is decreasing by an average of 0.8%, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. However, that\u2019s not true everywhere. The premium for that silver plan will jump 8.7% in Nashville, for example, 6.6% in Burlington, Vt., and 6.0% in Portland, Ore. The cost will drop 15.6% in Denver and 11.4% in Providence.\n\nYou\u2019ll want to get to know your new choices and reassess your options. \u201cIt\u2019s a good idea for consumers to check in, see what is being offered and its cost, and make an active decision to keep their plan or make a change,\u201d says Pollitz.\n\nYour Subsidy Could Change (Even If Your Income Didn\u2019t)\n\nWhat\u2019s more, if you qualified for a tax credit last year, which about 85% of exchange enrollees did, update your income information and financial assistance application and see how much of a subsidy you\u2019ll qualify for in 2015. Even if your income hasn\u2019t changed, the subsidy you\u2019re eligible for may go up or down. That\u2019s because it is based off the price of the second-lowest silver plan in your area, which could have changed.\n\nYou can use this newly updated calculator from the Kaiser Family Foundation to estimate your subsidy.\n\nYou\u2019re Not Stuck With Healthcare.gov\n\nWhile the federally run site garners most of the attention, it isn\u2019t the only place you can sign up for a plan.\n\nIf you expect to qualify for a premium subsidy (available if your income falls between 100 and 400% of the federal poverty level), your options are somewhat limited. You\u2019ll either have to shop on the exchange or a health comparison site that\u2019s authorized in your state to sign you up even if you qualify for a subsidy, such as ehealthinsurance.com and gohealth.com.\n\nIf you aren\u2019t going to qualify for a subsidy, you can buy insurance anywhere, including directly from a private insurer. Just keep in mind that if you look at only a single insurer\u2019s plans, you may miss less expensive or more appropriate options from competitors.\n\nFor the first time this year many Walmart stores have kiosks manned with insurance agents to answer questions about your plan options. They won\u2019t be able to sign you up in the store, however. You\u2019ll need to call or go online to directhealth.com to enroll.\n\nGiven the complexity of your options and the sign-up process, it\u2019s understandable if you\u2019d like telephone or in-person help. You can find local navigators or other resources in your area, such as nonprofits and consumer advocacy groups, at localhelp.healthcare.gov.\n\nDrag Your Feet and You Could Be Auto-Enrolled\n\nDon\u2019t wait until the last minute to shop, warns Pollitz. In most states consumers who have not actively chosen a new plan by December 15 will be automatically re-enrolled in their current plan, or switched to a similar one if that plan is no longer available. While you can still swap coverage even after you\u2019ve been re-enrolled, try to avoid that headache.\n\nIn a few states, such as Massachusetts and Oregon, there won\u2019t be any auto-renewal, says Pollitz, so if you want coverage next year you must actively renew. You also won\u2019t be auto renewed if your insurer is exiting the market in your area.\n\nYou Could Be Locked Out if You Delay\n\nPre-Obamacare, you could buy an individual health insurance plan at any time (assuming you were in good enough health to be approved, of course). Now the annual open enrollment window, which runs from November 15 through February 15 this year, is the only time you can sign up for individual coverage for 2015 (and you can\u2019t be turned down based on your health).\n\nUnless you have what\u2019s called a qualifying event during the year, such as losing job-based health coverage or moving to a different state, you will not be able to buy a plan, putting you at risk of paying a penalty.\n\nDespite all of the media attention and outreach last year, many consumers who didn\u2019t buy during the 2014 open enrollment period were surprised to find out later that they were locked out, says Carrie McLean, director of customer care at ehealthinsurance.com.\n\nOthers found themselves locked out until next year because they had lost insurance due to a life change (new job, divorce) and didn\u2019t realize the window to buy coverage closed in 60 days. If they finally got around to trying to sign up months later, it was too late.\n\nSince the new rules have kicked in, ehealthinsurance.com has recorded a spike in interest in short-term health plans. These plans, however, offer limited benefits and do not fulfill the requirement that you buy a qualified plan or pay a fine.
