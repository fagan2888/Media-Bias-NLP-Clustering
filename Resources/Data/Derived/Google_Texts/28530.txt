The Broncos’ replacement for Matt Prater might be on the roster now. With Prater’s four-game suspension looming, Denver acquired New York Giants’ kicker Brandon McManus for a conditional seventh-round draft pick, according to an NFL source.

It’s unlikely the Broncos will give up the draft pick because the condition is McManus must continue to be the team’s kicker after Prater’s suspension ends.

Prater was the best kicker in the NFL last season and the Broncos plan on having his job waiting for him when his suspension is lifted. Although the Broncos will continue to monitor other kickers who might become available after teams cut their rosters to 53 players Saturday, team officials have liked McManus since he kicked a 50-yard field goal in a preseason game for Indianapolis last year.

Denver moved quickly before McManus was placed on waivers, working a deal as multiple teams were expected to place a claim on the former Temple product, including the Philadelphia Eagles.

The Giants’ Josh Brown beat out McManus, despite McManus’ strong preseason. McManus, 23, made two field-goal attempts (46 and 47 yards) and 10 of his 11 kickoffs were touchbacks.

The Broncos cleared the stage for McManus’ audition in Thursday’s preseason finale by waiving rookie kicker Mitch Ewald. Ewald missed a short field-goal attempt Saturday, hurting his chances of winning the job.

McManus fits the profile for what the Broncos were seeking, a young kicker with a big leg capable of handling kickoffs and now has two years of NFL preseason experience.
