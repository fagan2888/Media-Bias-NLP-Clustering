Since California enacted a medical marijuana law in 1996, 20 other states and the District of Columbia have followed suit, with eight of them passing laws in the past four years alone. Two of them \u2014 Washington and Colorado \u2014 have even passed full-blown legalization of the drug. And none of that includes the many states that are currently in the process, such as New York and Minnesota. This huge shift in public opinion can be credited, in large part, to a wide range of studies and patient testimonies supporting the drug\u2019s health benefits. So, what are some of them?\n\nStress, Anxiety, and PTSD \u2014 It\u2019s a Mixed Bag\n\nNo matter how you ingest marijuana, there are possible side effects to the drug \u2014 pro-pot advocates will claim they\u2019re never as bad as pharmaceutical side effects \u2014 including anxiety and paranoia. These effects can subsequently lead to a higher blood pressure, arrhythmia, and other effects common to anxiety. In this way, it\u2019s a gamble when taking marijuana. For those who know how much they\u2019re taking and what to expect, however, may experience the opposite effect: calm, relaxation, and happiness.\n\nFor people with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), one of the worst possible anxiety disorders, marijuana might be able to alleviate symptoms. Although there\u2019s a scarcity of human research into the association, anecdotal evidence is heavy, and states, such as Main and New Hampshire, have begun allowing its use. The Department of Health and Human Services also signed off recently, on a study to test its benefits in PTSD patients.\n\nThe use of marijuana for anxiety disorders, and just plain stress, comes from the fact that the brain naturally produces cannabinoids, which are the active chemicals in marijuana \u2014 namely, delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC \u2014 and what help regulate how fear is processed in the brain.\n\nA May 2013 study found that people with PTSD showed lower levels of a certain endocannabinoid known as anandamide in the area of their brains associated with fear and anxiety. Thus, fewer cannabinoid receptors were being activated, spurring PTSD along. In theory, using marijuana would boost concentrations of these beneficial cannabinoids, reducing symptoms of PTSD. \u201cWe know very well that people with PTSD who use marijuana often experience more relief from their symptoms than they do from antidepressants and other psychiatric medications,\u201d said lead author Dr. Alexander Neumeister, of the Departments of Psychiatry and Radiology at New York University, in a press release.\n\nIn part, these calming effects could be the reasons why marijuana use has been linked to a 10 percent reduction in suicide rates, while also being considered for use in some Swiss prisons.\n\nCerebral Palsy and Other Neurodegenerative Diseases\n\nNeurodegenerative diseases affect millions of people in the U.S. Parkinson\u2019s disease, for example, affects an estimated one million people, while cerebral palsy affects as many as 764,000 children and adults. These diseases and more are all debilitating in their own way, as they affect the nervous system\u2019s ability to connect with the brain, therefore affecting a person\u2019s ability to move. Marijuana has shown huge promise in saving these people.\n\nMultiple sclerosis (MS), which occurs when the immune system attacks the nerve\u2019s myelin sheaths, causes the nerves to become unable to communicate with each other. In turn, this causes weakness in limbs, partial to complete loss of vision, and tremors. Studies on marijuana use among animals with MS showed that THC and other cannabinoids were able to target the inflammation-causing cells produced by the immune system, subsequently leading to less destruction of myelin. Another UK study found that 12 weeks of marijuana treatment helped relieve muscle stiffness in 30 percent of almost 300 patients suffering from MS.\n\nMarijuana has also been shown to reduce symptoms of Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD), which include rigid muscles, slow movement, and tremors. In a study of 22 patients who were all about 66 years old, tremor scores dropped after using marijuana. \u201cThe study suggests that cannabis might have a place in the therapeutic armamentarium of PD,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cLarger, controlled studies are need to verify the results.\u201d\n\nIn such patients, the results really do need to be seen to be believed. In December, Medical Daily reported the story of Jacqueline Patterson, a Missouri mother of four whose cerebral palsy had left her with a severe stutter caused by muscle stiffness, which has also caused her severe pain and the inability to use her right arm correctly. With marijuana, she becomes a totally different person, able to speak, move, and overall become less tense.\n\nCancer\n\nThe big one right here. Pretty much any state that legalizes marijuana for medical use lists cancer as one of the first conditions it can be used for. People undergoing chemotherapy for whatever their cancer may be often experience nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, and pain, according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Marijuana has been shown to alleviate all of these side effects. In fact, two FDA-approved medications, dronabinol and nabilone, are derived from THC and used in cancer patients and HIV/AIDS patients to treat nausea and vomiting. Dronabinol was also shown last year to ease pain in cancer patients. As for increasing appetite, well, they don\u2019t call it the munchies for nothing.\n\nBeyond chemo, there\u2019s also evidence that marijuana can help prevent the growth of tumors. According to the NIH, another cannabinoid, cannabidiol, has been shown to relieve pain as well as lower inflammation. Cannabinoids such as these have been shown to block cell growth, prevent the growth of blood vessels that aid metastasis (the spread of tumors), and kill tumor cells. Some researchers have even found a way to harness this power without the psychoactive effects.\n\n\u201cCannabinoids have a complex action; it hits a number of important processes that cancers need to survive,\u201d oncologist Dr. Wai Liu told The Huffington Post. \u201cFor that reason, it has really good potential over other drugs that only have one function. I am impressed by its activity profile, and feel it has a great future, especially if used with standard chemotherapies.\u201d\n\nFor Recreational Users\n\nAs marijuana becomes further engrained in American culture, some might ask, is it better to smoke weed or consume it through mediums like edibles and oils. It is indeed better to eat it, as it doesn\u2019t involve inhaling the harmful tars produced through the combustion of rolling paper. But even eating it may have its caveats, as getting the proper dose can be difficult. By far, the best way to toke healthily is to use a vaporizer, which heat the cannabis just enough to release active cannabinoids without releasing smoke and toxins. \u201cVaporizer users are only 40 percent as likely to report respiratory symptoms as users who do not vaporize,\u201d researchers of a 2007 study wrote. \u201cRegular users of joints, blunts, pipes, and water pipes might decrease respiratory symptoms by switching to a vaporizer.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "medical marijuana, marijuana, cancer, stress, anxiety, ptsd, neurodegenerative disease,", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Marijuana is making a record comeback in the U.S., and much of it is thanks to its ability to help people with certain illnesses.", "title": "3 Major Ways Marijuana Helps Sick People Live Normal Lives", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/health-benefits-medical-marijuana-3-major-ways-cannabis-helps-sick-people-live-normal-lives-283388", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/05/19/marijuana.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Marijuana is making a record comeback in the U.S., and much of it is thanks to its ability to help people with certain illnesses.", "title": "3 Major Ways Marijuana Helps Sick People Live Normal Lives", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/health-benefits-medical-marijuana-3-major-ways-cannabis-helps-sick-people-live-normal-lives-283388", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/05/19/marijuana.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/05/19/marijuana.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Drugs", "published_time": "2014-05-19T15:14:31-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-05-19T16:05:54-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Marijuana is making a record comeback in the U.S., and much of it is thanks to its ability to help people with certain illnesses."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0fb1\"", "article_summary": "The Department of Health and Human Services also signed off recently, on a study to test its benefits in PTSD patients.\nFor people with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), one of the worst possible anxiety disorders, marijuana might be able to alleviate symptoms.\nThese effects can subsequently lead to a higher blood pressure, arrhythmia, and other effects common to anxiety.\nMarijuana has also been shown to reduce symptoms of Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD), which include rigid muscles, slow movement, and tremors.\nIn theory, using marijuana would boost concentrations of these beneficial cannabinoids, reducing symptoms of PTSD."}
