He said that equipment will include diagnostic imaging equipment, such as X-ray machines and CT scanners; patient monitoring equipment including cardiac monitors, ICU monitors and telemonitors; defibrillators; and some respiratory equipment.\n\nZielazinski said Marin General could realize discounts of up to 50 percent by agreeing to purchase about 85 percent of this type of equipment and attendant services from Philips.\n\nHe said much of Marin General\u2019s equipment is old and hasn\u2019t been maintained due to the split with Sutter Health, which formerly managed the hospital.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve really suffered a bit, and this is going to get us to state of the art very, very quickly,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re excited about that.\u201d\n\nWanda Jones, president of the New Century Healthcare Institute, a San Francisco-based think tank, said, \u201cIt could well be very cost effective for Marin General to get it in one batch. It means they\u2019re going to be paying something every year rather than have a bolus of capital required. This will limit the amount of capital debt they have to acquire.\u201d\n\nZielazinski said, \u201cThe idea is it helps us maintain our costs over time.\u201d\n\nUnder the agreement, two Philips employees \u2014 a director of client management and a service engineer \u2014 will be based at Marin General full time. In addition to servicing the equipment, Philips will provide training and help plan equipment replacements and updates.\n\nThe agreement is the first large-scale partnership of its kind for an independent community hospital and the third for Philips in North America in the past six months. Last June, Westchester Medical Center Health Network in New York announced a $500 million, 15-year agreement with Royal Philips to provide equipment and services to the hospital system.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nZielazinski said in addition to the cost savings, the partnership will help Marin General adapt to changes in the health care marketplace occurring as a result of the Affordable Care Act. Health care reform has linked hospitals\u2019 Medicare reimbursements to long-term patient outcomes.\n\nIn a statement, Frans van Houten, CEO of Royal Philips, said, \u201cForward-thinking organizations such as Marin General Hospital understand that for community hospitals to differentiate themselves and to comply with new value based models, they need to focus on the patient experience and team up with a technology partner that has a deep understanding of how a hospital operates.\u201d\n\nZielazinski said, \u201cThese kind of arrangements are going to become more the norm over time as health care evolves due to the reform mechanisms that are happening.\u201d\n\nOne type of medical technology that Marin General\u2019s agreement with Philips won\u2019t include is an electronic medical records system. The functionality of the hospital\u2019s Paragon software system, supplied by McKesson Corp., has been a source of bitter criticism by Marin General nurses.\n\n\u201cThere is no system out there that people are universally happy with,\u201d Zielazinski said, regarding electronic medical records systems. \u201cQuite frankly, they were built and modeled on some pretty old technology.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Marin General Hospital has entered into a $90 million agreement with Royal Philips to purchase the bulk of its medical technology over the next 15 years from the Netherlands-based company as well as have it provide service and support for the equipmen", "title": "Marin General Hospital signs $90M deal with Netherlands-based company", "og": {"url": "http://www.marinij.com/article/NO/20160115/NEWS/160119843", "image": {"width": "1200px", "identifier": "http://local.marinij.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/marinij.png?052016", "height": "630px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Marin General Hospital signs $90M deal with Netherlands-based company"}, "twitter": {"domain": "marinij.com", "description": "Marin General Hospital has entered into a $90 million agreement with Royal Philips to purchase the bulk of its medical technology over the next 15 years from the Netherlands-based company as well as have it provide service and support for the equipmen", "title": "Marin General Hospital signs $90M deal with Netherlands-based company", "url": "http://www.marinij.com/article/NO/20160115/NEWS/160119843", "image": {"src": "http://local.marinij.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/marinij.png?052016"}, "site": "@marinij", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id551745144", "iphone": "id502957174", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.ladailynews"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "keywords": "marinnews, Business", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "marinnews, Business"}, "article_summary": "In addition to servicing the equipment, Philips will provide training and help plan equipment replacements and updates.\nThe functionality of the hospital\u2019s Paragon software system, supplied by McKesson Corp., has been a source of bitter criticism by Marin General nurses.\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited about that.\u201dWanda Jones, president of the New Century Healthcare Institute, a San Francisco-based think tank, said, \u201cIt could well be very cost effective for Marin General to get it in one batch.\nZielazinski said Marin General could realize discounts of up to 50 percent by agreeing to purchase about 85 percent of this type of equipment and attendant services from Philips.\nMarin General Hospital has entered into a $90 million agreement with Royal Philips to purchase the bulk of its medical technology over the next 15 years from the Netherlands-based company as well as have it provide service and support for the equipment."}
