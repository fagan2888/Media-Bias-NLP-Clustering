Vail Music Festival\n\nPossibly the most interesting program on all of Vail\u2019s schedule this season. Berlioz\u2019s elegant, emotional symphony is paired with the wow of Poulenc\u2019s \u201cConcerto for Two Pianos and Orchestra.\u201d Alessio Bax and Anne-Marie McDermott are the dazzling duo.\n\nGerald R. Ford Amphitheater, Vail, 877-812-5700 or bravovail.org\n\nBart\u00f3k + Bj\u00f6rk, July 7, Colorado Music Festival\n\nThe Colorado Music Festival is plunging into its next chapter with new music director Jean-Marie Zeitouni firmly in place. There\u2019s some traditional fare on the schedule but also some insane musical mashups, like this concert that has Steve Hackman pairing sounds from the classic composer and the present-day pop star. Could be a disaster; could change your life.\n\nChautauqua Auditorium, Boulder, 303-665-0599 or comusic.org\n\nOlga Kern, July 8, Strings Music Festival\n\nOlga Kern puts on one of the best shows in classical music, and she shines brightest in solo recitals, like this one at this versatile festival in Steamboat Springs. Fans love her on Rachmaninoff and Beethoven and she\u2019ll dive into both on this special night. Expect good playing and plenty of personality.\n\nStrings Music Pavilion, Steamboat Springs, 970- 879-5056 or stringsmusicfestival.com\n\n\u201cMozart Under Moonlight,\u201d Colorado Symphony Orchestra, July 10, Arvada Center\n\nWe wish the orchestra would do a whole series of outdoor concerts in the summer, but we\u2019ll settle for this night of Mozart in Arvada. The broad program features his first ,Symphony No. 1, and his last, Symphony No. 41.\n\nArvada Center Outdoor Amphitheater, Arvada, 303-623-7876 or coloradosymphony.org\n\nThe Weilersteins and Tchaikovsky, July 25, Bravo! Vail Music Festival\n\nCellist Alisa Weilerstein does some of her best playing in Vail, and that\u2019s saying plenty. She\u2019ll be motivated by the presence of her sibling, Joshua, on the podium and \u201cVariations on a Rococo Theme\u201d on the program. Symphony No. 6 rounds out the night. The New York Philharmonic provides backup.\n\nGerald R. Ford Amphitheater, Vail, 877-812-5700 or bravovail.org\n\nSharon Isbin, Stanley Jordan and Romero Lubambo, Aug. 6, Aspen Music Festival\n\nThis is just too good to miss. Three of the world\u2019s mightiest guitar gods \u2014 classical Isbin, jazz Jordan and Brazilian Lubambo \u2014 mesh styles on a beautiful Aspen night. Match-ups like this are what make a fest a fest.\n\nHarris Concert Hall, Aspen, 970-925-9042 or aspenmusicfestival.com\n\nColorado Symphony Orchestra, \u201cAudience Choice!,\u201d Aug. 8.\n\nThe fact that the CSO is leaving this night\u2019s music up to its patrons is 100 percent endearing, and just the kind of thing that makes a night with the hometown orchestra homey. Details on voting are to come, but the choices will be from the orchestra\u2019s best efforts from past years. Watch the website for your options.\n\nBoettcher Concert Hall, 303-623-7876 or coloradosymphony.org\n\nJoshua Bell, Aug. 14, Aspen Music Festival\n\nJoshua Bell is an international figure, but his Colorado connections, due largely to this festival, have long made him one of us. He\u2019s back to play and, for the first time here, conduct. The program is impressive, with Bach\u2019s Violin Concerto in E major and Beethoven\u2019s Seventh Symphony.\n\nBenedict Music Tent, Aspen, 970-925-9042 or aspenmusicfestival.com\n\nAlan Gilbert, Aug. 23, Santa Fe Chamber Music Festival\n\nLandmark events are rare for festivals that have been around a long time, but this performance, conducted by New York Philharmonic music director Alan Gilbert, is a big moment, indeed, for this heralded music series. The main event: Messiaen\u2019s majestic \u201cFrom the Canyons to the Stars,\u201d inspired by the Western terrain \u2013 which is sorta perfect.\n\nLensic Performing Arts Center, Santa Fe, N.M., 505-982-1890 or santafechambermusic.com\n\nJoyce Yang and Augustin Hadelich, Aug. 1, Salida Aspen Concerts\n\nThis performance series remains Colorado\u2019s best-kept secret as stars from the Aspen Music Festival roll over the pass for up-close concerts at Salida High School auditorium. Pianist Yang and violinist Hadelich share the spotlight on Stravinsky, Debussy, Franck and a few other surprise selections.
