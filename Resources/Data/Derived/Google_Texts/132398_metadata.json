(Source: Pinal County Sheriff's Office)\n\nA San Tan Valley teenager is in jail on suspicion of impersonating a police officer after a motorist spotted his fake police vehicle was equipped with a temporary registration license plate, Pinal County sheriff\u2019s deputies said.\n\nMichael Montano, 19, was arrested Friday and booked into the Pinal County Jail on charges of impersonating a peace officer and possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony offense. His vehicle and 9-mm handgun were seized and placed into evidence.\n\nThe motorist told deputies he was driving in San Tan Valley Friday morning and saw a vehicle driven by Montano come up behind him with red and blue emergency lights flashing. The motorist said he knew he was speeding and thought he was being stopped by a law enforcement officer.\n\nMontano then drove by him and got behind another car on Ironwood Road driven by a young female, PCSO said. As the woman began to pull over, the first motorist noticed the temporary registration affixed to Montano\u2019s vehicle.\n\nHe followed Montano to a Chevron Gas Station at Ironwood and Ocotillo, confronted him and asked if he was a cop. According to PCSO, Montano said, \u201cI got this,\u201d and lifted his shirt, revealing a 9-mm handgun concealed in the top of his pants.\n\nThe motorist then walked to the rear of Montano\u2019s car, described as a 2015 Ford Focus, removed the temporary registration and called 911.\n\nSheriff\u2019s deputies arrived and found Montano\u2019s car equipped with emergency red and blue LED lights inside the rear window, inside of the front windshield near the passenger-side visor and in the front grill. The vehicle was also equipped with an operational siren and public address system.\n\nPinal County Sheriff Paul Babeu said his office uses unmarked sedans and Tahoes for detectives and deputies in traffic enforcement.\n\nBabeu said Montano admitted he was using the emergency lights in his vehicle so that people would pull over, thinking they were being stopped by law enforcement personnel.\n\nSheriff\u2019s deputies are trying to locate possible victims who may have been stopped by Montano.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "A San Tan Valley teenager is in jail on suspicion of impersonating a police officer after a motorist spotted his fake police vehicle was equipped with a temporary registration license plate.", "author": "Phil Benson", "og": {"url": "http://www.tucsonnewsnow.com/story/29525942/teenager-arrested-for-allegedly-impersonating-officer", "image": "http://MEREDITHAZ.images.worldnow.com/images/8289556_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A San Tan Valley teenager is in jail on suspicion of impersonating a police officer after a motorist spotted his fake police vehicle was equipped with a temporary registration license plate.", "title": "Teenager arrested for allegedly impersonating officer"}, "twitter": {"account_id": 17641427, "title": "Teenager arrested for allegedly impersonating officer", "image": "http://MEREDITHAZ.images.worldnow.com/images/8289556_G.jpg", "creator": "@TucsonNewsNow", "site": "@TucsonNewsNow", "card": "summary", "description": "A San Tan Valley teenager is in jail on suspicion of impersonating a police officer after a motorist spotted his fake police vehicle was equipped with a temporary registration license plate."}, "wnreadableurl": "teenager-arrested-for-allegedly-impersonating-officer", "ROBOTS": "Index,Follow,NoArchive", "owner": "MEREDITHAZ", "fb": {"admins": 644426401, "app_id": 215936215202939}, "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/TucsonNewsNow"}, "date": "2015/07/11", "google-site-verification": "wum6pK5VyCXxNIhQSMSz7se_UVLjlDGJFKTm4EWnWUY", "KEYWORDS": "Tucson News Now,KOLD News 13,FOX 11,KOLD,KMSB,Tucson,Southern Arizona,Arizona", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS25", "news_keywords": "Tucson News Now,KOLD News 13,FOX 11,KOLD,KMSB,Tucson,Southern Arizona,Arizona"}, "article_summary": "Michael Montano, 19, was arrested Friday and booked into the Pinal County Jail on charges of impersonating a peace officer and possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony offense.\n(Source: Pinal County Sheriff's Office)A San Tan Valley teenager is in jail on suspicion of impersonating a police officer after a motorist spotted his fake police vehicle was equipped with a temporary registration license plate, Pinal County sheriff\u2019s deputies said.\nPinal County Sheriff Paul Babeu said his office uses unmarked sedans and Tahoes for detectives and deputies in traffic enforcement.\n(Source: Pinal County Sheriff's Office)A 2015 Ford Focus he was driving was equipped with a PA system, siren and emergency \"police\" lights.\nThe motorist said he knew he was speeding and thought he was being stopped by a law enforcement officer."}
