Fewer than 6,000 Maine families still receive assistance. Tens of thousands more Mainers have been cut from food stamps and health care programs.\n\nThese drastic and largely indiscriminate cuts to public assistance and public health programs have predominantly affected poor women (many of them single mothers) and their children. As a result, extreme child poverty in Maine has increased by 50 percent, and child hunger has skyrocketed. One in four Maine children now don\u2019t have consistent access to food.\n\nAccording to a detailed study by Sandra Butler, a professor at the University of Maine, more former TANF recipients have become homeless than have been able to find jobs in Maine\u2019s slowly recovering economy. Maine\u2019s food banks and shelters have been pushed to the breaking point, and things are about to get worse as we head into the coldest months of the year.\n\n\u201cWell, at least we\u2019re saving some money,\u201d you might say to yourself (if you\u2019re a particularly cold-hearted person), but you\u2019d be wrong.\n\nEven if we set aside all the long-term societal costs and focus only on the short term, we\u2019ve put ourselves deep in the hole.\n\nThe rejection of federal health care funding alone \u2013 a decision championed by Gov. LePage, and ratified last year by just a single vote in the Republican-controlled Senate \u2013 prevented $350 million more a year from entering Maine\u2019s economy. The funds would have helped create thousands of new jobs while saving lives and preventing suffering.\n\nInstead, hospitals and clinics across the state are facing millions of dollars in bad debt trying to treat the newly uninsured.\n\n\u201cWell, at least we\u2019re preventing some people from ripping off the system,\u201d you might say if you\u2019re looking for some thin silver lining to this whole debacle. But even there the results are disappointing to the point of being laughable.\n\nFrom 2011 to 2013, the years for which data is readily available, LePage spent $700,000 a year on eight additional full-time fraud inspectors. Despite Republicans\u2019 claims that recipient fraud is widespread, only a few dozen cases were ever referred for prosecution. Of those, an even smaller number were successfully tried, and just $488,303 was ordered to be repaid over the entire period. It\u2019s not clear how much money was actually recouped, but it was clearly nowhere near enough to even pay the salaries of the new inspectors.\n\nMore taxpayer money than this was lost in payments to conservative consultant (and LePage ally) Gary Alexander for his report suggesting that Maine deny more public assistance (which turned out to be not just plagiarized but also wildly inaccurate in its assumptions and projections).\n\nYou\u2019d think that this track record would give us all some pause, but LePage and his allies are charging full speed ahead.\n\nNew proposals range from the picayune, like banning the purchase of iced tea with food stamps, to the insanely counterproductive, like eliminating the Parents as Scholars program, which has been instrumental in helping Mainers receiving public assistance earn college degrees and find decent jobs.\n\nSo how did we get so far off track? In large part, it\u2019s because many conservative politicians have a vested interest in making the problems we face around public assistance far worse. They hype anecdotal and infrequent fraud and demonize poor people because it\u2019s politically effective.\n\nIf they were really focused on lifting low-income Mainers out of poverty, they would vote to raise the minimum wage. If they were really focused on preventing fraud and malfeasance, they wouldn\u2019t have voted to allow the corporate scam artists that raided the New Markets tax credit program to walk away with tens of millions of dollars in public funds.\n\nInstead, they tell us a story, one that\u2019s compelling because it gives us an excuse not to worry about the suffering that exists around us. If poverty is a personal failure rather than a community concern, then we can all feel a bit better about ourselves.\n\nBut their story isn\u2019t true. The numbers don\u2019t add up, and the hungry kids are far too real.\n\nIt\u2019s time to stop telling tall tales and start focusing on what really works to improve the lives of all Mainers. It\u2019s absolutely possible to find the right balance between our Maine values of promoting independence and coming together to help each other when we need it. The first step is acknowledging that the blunt and reckless approach has failed.\n\nMike Tipping is a political junkie who works for the Maine People\u2019s Alliance.
