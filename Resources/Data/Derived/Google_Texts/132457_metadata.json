You had a tough ad hitting Senator Cruz saying he couldn\u2019t be trusted you pulled it down, but I just watched it on TV.\n\nTRUMP: No no, I pulled it down because I wanted to be nice, I wanted to be a very nice person. Then I saw him do negative ad, I put it back up. It\u2019s honorable ad. It\u2019s a very honest ad. He\u2019s a nasty guy. People don\u2019t like him. Think of it, you are United States senator, you have a lot of friends that are in the senate, in this case he doesn\u2019t have any friends. you don\u2019t have one endorsement from one U.S. senator these are people that work with him. How can that be possible?\n\nDICKERSON: You also have questioned his Christianity. Is that a Christian thing to do?\n\nTRUMP: I say this, you can\u2019t lie then hold up the Bible. okay? He consistently lies. What he did to Ben Carson was a disgrace. What he did with the voter violation, which is a fraud, is a disgrace. You can\u2019t do that, you can\u2019t hold up all of these values and hold up the Bible and then lie.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Trump: Cruz 'Can't Lie Then Hold Up The Bible'", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Trump: Cruz 'Can't Lie Then Hold Up The Bible'", "title": "Trump: Cruz 'Can't Lie Then Hold Up The Bible' - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/02/trump2.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2016/02/14/trump-cruz-cant-lie-then-hold-up-the-bible/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Trump: Cruz 'Can't Lie Then Hold Up The Bible'", "creator": "@pamkeyNEN", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/02/trump2.jpg", "title": "Trump: Cruz 'Can't Lie Then Hold Up The Bible' - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Donald Trump, Sen.
