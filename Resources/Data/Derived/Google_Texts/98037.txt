Christmas is right around the corner and for residents of one town, they are starting early in gathering toys for those less fortunate. In it's third year, the Marion Toython Drive has seen the fundraiser grow each year, but they've seen the community as a whole grow closer together, according to Sponsor Penny Kennedy.

"This is wonderful because when everyone pulls together it shows that God is a part of our community and it shows that we all pull together and we work together as a Godly community," Kennedy said. "That's what we are supposed to do, we are supposed to work together."

The Marion Police Department along with Penny's Flea Market spent the day gathering toys for drive, toys that they say could already fill upwards to 5 SUV's.

"Times are tough," Marion Policeman Robbye Sprangler said. "Some people, the children see things that they want and sometimes the parents can't get it. Our philosophy is that it's always better to give than to receive and we are going to try to help out some children this Christmas."

In addition to the drive, a poker run was held as well as a barbeque to raise more money to buy more toys as well as turkeys and other needs for the elderly. Great Outreach Missionary Baptist Church says a portion of their funds raised from the BBQ would go to the toython, while the other portion would go to their building fund for their new location on Highway 39 North.

"We do this annually as a fundraiser," Marion Alderman Barbara Anthony said. "This helps the needy family and this really, really brightens my day to see a child less fortunate be able to get these toys during this time of the year."

The Police Department says they will be collecting toys for children until Christmas Eve.
