GDP is down 25 percent and unemployment exceeds 25 percent. Private-sector wages are down by a similar amount, but Greece has failed to attract investment sorely needed to expand exports and eventually pay its debts.\n\nThe latter is no surprise, because the austerity-imposed meltdown has pushed at least 35 percent of private bank loans into nonperforming status, and bankruptcy courts are overwhelmed. Even before the recent bank closures and capital controls, credit was extraordinarily difficult to find and small businesses were shutting down throughout the country at an alarming pace.\n\nRelated: Why Greece Can\u2019t Grow Its Way Out of This Mess\n\nMore austerity \u2014 without debt relief \u2014 would further pummel the Greek economy and take its debt-to-GDP ratio \u2014 now an astonishing 177 percent of GDP \u2014 to even more absurd heights. And when Greece ultimately defaults, German losses on holdings of Greek debt \u2014 both public and private\u2014will be much greater than if Germany and other creditors wrote down Greek debt now.\n\nReckoning with the situation requires cutting Greek sovereign debt by as much as half and empowering the European Central Bank to provide Greek banks with massive creditor-of-last-resort financing \u2014 much as the Federal Reserve and Treasury did for U.S. banks during the financial crisis.\n\nNeither of those is likely to happen, and either Greek Prime MinisterAlex Tsipras signs up for more bloodletting and inevitable economic collapse or persuades Greeks to quit the euro.\n\nOther governments have successfully introduced new currencies. For example, when states such as the Ukraine and Georgia were set loose from the former Soviet Union they replaced the ruble.\n\nSimply, Athens has to issue drachma bank notes and remark bank deposits and exiting loans to the new currency.\n\nRelated: The Political Failures Behind the Greek Debt Crisis\n\nBank depositors would take losses. Remember, when the European Union restructured the banks in Cyprus, it imposed haircuts on depositors. Whatever workout is devised for the Greek banks as part of a new austerity plan would eventually do the same.\n\nPrivate creditors throughout Europe would take losses, too, but with the Greek economy in free fall, those are already inevitable \u2014 even if not yet acknowledged by private-sector accounting.\n\nCzech Republic has the crown and Poland the zloty, and both weathered the financial crisis and tough times that followed much better than Portugal, Ireland, Greece and Spain \u2014 all of which required bailouts or assistance of some sort \u2014 because a currency that can adjust prices of imports and exports to the underlying competitiveness of an economy simply provides more flexibility than the euro.\n\nSet loose from the euro, Greece at least would have a chance at prosperity, but the rub for Germany is the other Mediterranean nations could follow Greece's example if it proved successful. Then, a downsized euro \u2014 with an underlying value that was dominated more by German competitiveness \u2014 would rise substantially in value against the dollar and other key currencies.\n\nAs structured now, the euro is undervalued for Germany and overvalued for southern European economies, guaranteeing German export success, trade surpluses and prosperity. Without those weak sisters, Germany's real competitiveness would be exposed and its industrial might \u2014 with a fairly valued currency \u2014 might not prove so mighty after all.\n\nThis piece originally appeared on CNBC.
