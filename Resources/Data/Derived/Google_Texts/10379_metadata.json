Now, our family has fallen hopelessly apart. This past year has been a never ending nightmare. Every day without him brings new challenges.\u201d\n\nThat was back in February of 2015. Now, another year has passed by, and Bridget Pine says she and her 3 kids are still without a proper death benefit, following Scott Pine\u2019s 2014 death. The Orange County Deputy was shot and killed, while investigating a string of burglaries.\n\nLegislation to help the surviving spouses of law enforcement died last year amid a budget impasse between the House and Senate. It\u2019s back again this year in the House as well as the Senate.\n\nLast week, the Senate\u2014at the direction of Senate President Andy Gardiner (R-Orlando)\u2014quickly took up the measure to make sure it passed early in the Session.\n\n\u201cYou know, there were a lot of casualties last year and this was one of the bills that was ready to go,\u201d said Gardiner, at the time. \u201cThis is an important issue, not just for law enforcement and those who risk their lives every day for us, but it\u2019s an important to us in Orange County and Central Florida. So, thank for giving us this opportunity.\u201d\n\nThe bill\u2019s sponsor is Sen. Jeremy Ring (D-Margate), who says it\u2019s for all first responders who perished in the line of duty, including Deputy Pine and survivors like his wife Bridget.\n\nHe says the measure makes two changes to the Florida Retirement System.\n\nIt has two main options: the traditional and most popular option known as the pension plan and the 401K style investment plan. Today, the pension plan provides a survivor benefit for the spouses of those who died in the line of duty\u2014about half of the person\u2019s monthly salary. Ring\u2019s bill changes that to allowing the spouse to receive the person\u2019s full salary.\n\n\u201cSecond, the bill permits the surviving spouse or children of an investment plan member in the special risk class when killed in the line of duty to opt into the FRS investment plan Survivors Benefits Program in lieu of receiving normal retirement benefits under the FRS investment plan,\u201d said Ring.\n\nThat part of the bill would apply to the family of Deputy Pine, who had the investment plan. Today, that plan does not include a death benefit, other than the rest of the account balance.\n\nAnd, Sen. Darren Soto (D-Kissimmee) praised Ring\u2019s bill.\n\n\u201cThe Pine family was left with next to nothing when if he had the other\u2014the defined benefit\u2014it would have been a robust benefit plan to help his wife and his three children,\u201d said Soto. \u201cSo, I\u2019m glad that this year we\u2019re going to get it done, since last year, it was quite unfortunate that this got left on the table.\u201d\n\nSenator Ring too felt that way, and he says he hopes the bill will never be used as a negotiating tool by the House again.\n\n\u201cThis is a bill that I hope never has to be used, other than clearly for Pine family and we thank them for being here today,\u201d said Ring. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that we should ever be negotiating on the bodies of our dead first responders. So, as we send this bill over to the House today, I\u2019d like to be strong as a Senate that the House knows that we do a lot of negotiating back and forth and that\u2019s part of the process. But, we don\u2019t always have to do that. Sometimes, we can just do what\u2019s right.\u201d\n\nAnd, before unanimously passing the bill, all 40 Senators agreed to stand with Senator Ring by co-sponsoring the measure.\n\nAnd, Senate President Gardiner says while he\u2019s open to discussing more with the House on different pension efforts, he doesn\u2019t think the death benefits provision should be included in the House bill.\n\n\u201cI think that there\u2019s been some concern that it may become a vehicle for some other things, some FRS reforms, and some things that have floated around for awhile,\u201d said Gardiner. \u201cThose are all legitimate issues, but for the family that was here today, we just think it should be clean. We\u2019ll have those debates on other issues. And, so I know the family was going over to visit with some House members, and I hope that that\u2019s the message is: let\u2019s do this, and let\u2019s get it done for the family and not make it a vehicle for other things.\u201d\n\nBut, House Speaker Steve Crisafulli had a different view on the issue that he\u2019s made one of his top priorities. He says the House had been working with Ring on pension reform.\n\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know exactly what Senator Ring had to say,\u201d he said. \u201cBut, I know that we have a pension bill that has a multitude of different pieces in it that regard pension and I do know that he has been over and he has talked to my Chief of Staff Kathy Mears about this very issue. So, if he\u2019s railing against us for having it in our package, and he came over and talked to her about seeing what they could do over there with different parts of our package, then I think he\u2019s probably contradicting what he originally said. But, having said that, I don\u2019t know what he said over there on the floor.\u201d\n\nStill, Crisafulli says he continues to remain hopeful the Senate will accept the House Pension Reform package, which includes the death benefit.\n\nIt also includes a controversial provision that changes the default from the traditional pension plan to the investment plan for new hires. Opponents say the pension plan is the more secure retirement option.\n\nMeanwhile, the House package is slated for its first and last official hearing in the House Appropriations Committee Tuesday. If it passes there, it heads to the floor.\n\nFor more news updates, follow Sascha Cordner on Twitter: @SaschaCordner.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "none", "description": "A bill stemming from the death of a fallen sheriff\u2019s deputy is putting the House and Senate at odds over a pension reform proposal.", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://health.wusf.usf.edu/post/death-benefits-bill-inspired-fallen-deputy-may-be-causing-rift-between-house-senate", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/shared/npr/styles/medium/nprshared/201602/466866360.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A bill stemming from the death of a fallen sheriff\u2019s deputy is putting the House and Senate at odds over a pension reform proposal.", "title": "Death Benefits Bill Inspired By Fallen Deputy May Be Causing Rift Between House, Senate"}, "story_id": 466866308, "twitter": {"site": "@HealthNewsFL", "card": "summary", "creator": "@HealthNewsFL"}, "author": "Sascha Cordner", "org_id": 390, "dc": {"title": "Death Benefits Bill Inspired By Fallen Deputy May Be Causing Rift Between House, Senate"}, "nid": 13629, "datePublished": "2016-02-16", "wordCount": 1273, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "A bill stemming from the death of a fallen sheriff\u2019s deputy is putting the House and Senate at odds over a pension reform proposal.\nIt also includes a controversial provision that changes the default from the traditional pension plan to the investment plan for new hires.\nIt has two main options: the traditional and most popular option known as the pension plan and the 401K style investment plan.\nAnd, Senate President Gardiner says while he\u2019s open to discussing more with the House on different pension efforts, he doesn\u2019t think the death benefits provision should be included in the House bill.\nOpponents say the pension plan is the more secure retirement option."}
