Phillip)\n\nTed Cruz is from Texas and, boy does he need The Lone Star state to deliver for him on Super Tuesday.\n\nRight now, the Donald Trump Express is rolling toward the Republican National Convention in Cleveland and a nomination speech as the billionaire has racked up 81 delegates through three primary and caucus wins. Cruz and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio are both holding 17 delegates each.\n\nSuper Tuesday has almost 600 delegates up for grabs and Texas is the largest prize with its 155 delegates. While polling shows Trump leading in almost every state voting on Tuesday, Cruz is showing strength in his home state.\n\nCruz currently leads Trump 34 percent to 26.8 percent \u2014 with Rubio at 18.2 percent \u2014 in Texas, according to polling averages aggregated by the website Real Clear Politics\n\nNickel Reddy, owner of Maklemore\u2019s Ale House in Nacogdoches, about two hours north of Houston, was planning to host a Cruz event Saturday and said he sees a lot of support for the conservative in the small East Texas town of 33,000.\n\nBut while Cruz is performing well in small towns in Texas, Reddy said there is plenty of visible support for Trump as well.\n\n\u201cThe younger ones around here seem to be for Trump,\u201d Reddy said by phone. \u201cBut there\u2019s a lot of Cruz people around here.\u201d\n\n\u2022RELATED STORY: Marco Rubio keeps on attacking Donald Trump after insult-trading debate\n\nNacogdoches is heavily Republican. In 2012, Mitt Romney defeated President Barack Obama 67 percent to 31 percent there. It\u2019s the kind of place Cruz needs to dominate, according to Southern Methodist University associate political science professor Matthew Wilson.\n\nWilson said Texas is really \u201cCruz\u2019s last stand\u201d to make a run at Trump.\n\n\u201cCruz is particularly strong among the evangelical constituency and has some strength in East Texas,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cRubio has typically done best among higher income and the suburban areas in Dallas and Houston. But Trump is fairly well spread out all over.\u201d\n\nThursday night\u2019s debate at the University of Houston may have also helped the anti-Trump sentiment among Republicans.\n\nBoth Rubio and Cruz took turns going after Trump. Rubio hit him especially hard on charges of Trump using undocumented immigrants on his properties and Cruz attacked him for comments supporting Planned Parenthood and the Affordable Care Act. Pundits praised Rubio for a deft debate performance, with some wondering what took the Florida senator so long to mount an offensive like that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2022RELATED STORY: Read who Hollywood conservatives are supporting in the GOP race\n\nJack Pitney, political science professor at Claremont McKenna College, said Rubio had likely been biding his time and waiting for Trump to collapse. But when that didn\u2019t happen, he was forced to go on the offensive.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it moves votes immediately, but his performance reassured his supporters and contributors,\u201d Pitney said. \u201cI suspect there will be a massive inflow of cash into the Rubio campaign and the Super PACs supporting him.\u201d\n\nRubio also kept hitting Trump on Friday, appearing on \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d and saying \u201ca con artist is about to take over\u201d the GOP.\n\nBut a short time later, Trump picked up the endorsement of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who is widely credited with pounding Rubio in a previous debate.\n\nA Rubio surge wouldn\u2019t necessarily hurt Cruz, but as 13 states line up to cast votes to pick a nominee, a Texas win remains critical to Cruz to blunt Trump\u2019s momentum and allow him to lay claim to being able to beat the billionaire at least twice this primary season.\n\nCruz has maintained that he\u2019s the only one who has actually beaten Trump \u2014 in Iowa \u2014 and that he\u2019s the best candidate to beat the Democrats in a general election. Cruz also laid out key endorsements in Texas, notably from sitting Gov. Greg Abbott.\n\nBut Cruz was mindful of Rubio\u2019s performance as well in the debate and pointed out on CNN that Rubio isn\u2019t leading Trump in Florida polls and said, \u201cIf you can\u2019t win your home state, that\u2019s a problem.\u201d\n\nFriday morning, Trump took to Twitter \u2014 as he\u2019s been prone to do most of the campaign \u2014 to fire at Rubio as well.\n\n\u201cLightweight choker Marco Rubio looks like a little boy on stage,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cNot presidential material.\u201d\n\nSome Republicans are wondering how things got to this messy point where a billionaire tycoon and reality television show entertainer has bested more traditional candidates on the path to the GOP nomination.\n\nWilson said the Texas Republican Party has been neutral on the candidates, but he explained they privately want to stop Trump\u2019s momentum because they fear his candidacy will destroy the GOP and lead to not only losing the White House in November, but possibly hurting Republicans down the voting ticket as well.\n\nHe said there is a fear that a Trump nomination would keep some Republicans at home on Election Day.\n\n\u201cSome of those Republicans think he\u2019s not a conservative and lacks any core ideological conviction,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cThey fear real damage done to the party and him losing to Hillary Clinton could be so catastrophic, it would put them back to 2008.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ted Cruz is from Texas and, boy does he need The Lone Star state to deliver for him on Super Tuesday.Right now, the Donald Trump Express is rolling toward the Republican National Convention in Cleveland and a nomination speech as the billionair", "title": "Why Super Tuesday could be the \u2018last stand\u2019 for Ted Cruz", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailynews.com/government-and-politics/20160226/why-super-tuesday-could-be-the-last-stand-for-ted-cruz", "image": {"width": "1500px", "identifier": "http://www.dailynews.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/LA/20160226/NEWS/160229607/AR/0/AR-160229607.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "1045px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Why Super Tuesday could be the \u2018last stand\u2019 for Ted Cruz"}, "twitter": {"domain": "dailynews.com", "description": "Ted Cruz is from Texas and, boy does he need The Lone Star state to deliver for him on Super Tuesday.Right now, the Donald Trump Express is rolling toward the Republican National Convention in Cleveland and a nomination speech as the billionair", "title": "Why Super Tuesday could be the \u2018last stand\u2019 for Ted Cruz", "url": "http://www.dailynews.com/government-and-politics/20160226/why-super-tuesday-could-be-the-last-stand-for-ted-cruz", "image": {"src": "http://www.dailynews.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/LA/20160226/NEWS/160229607/AR/0/AR-160229607.jpg?Maxh=900&Maxw=900"}, "site": "@ladailynews", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id551745144", "iphone": "id502957174", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.ladailynews"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "Donald Trump,Election 2016,presidential election,Ted Cruz, Presidential elections", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Donald Trump,Election 2016,presidential election,Ted Cruz, Presidential elections"}, "article_summary": "Republican presidential candidate, businessman Donald Trump, regards Republican presidential candidate, Sen.
