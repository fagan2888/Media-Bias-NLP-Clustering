You don\u2019t say yes to everybody,\u201d Manchin argued. He asserted votes in favor of the legislation were \u201cirresponsible.\u201d\n\nU.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.)\n\nCapito denied that. She said many of those tax credits had been extended for years and are critical to thousands of West Virginians.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at 160,000 West Virginia households that are going to get some relief at the lower end, the Earned Income Tax Credit, the Child Tax Credit hits 95,000 households \u2014 these are people who are on the edge,\u201d Capito said in defense of her vote.\n\nOther tax cuts that were made permanent include the research and experimentation tax credit, the American Opportunity Tax Credit for undergraduate tuition and allowances for seniors to continue tax-free charitable donations from Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs).\n\nAlso extended through 2019 is a corporate tax break that lets companies more quickly depreciate equipment values.\n\nIn the legislation, several tax increases created in the Affordable Care Act have been delayed, including the taxes on expensive insurance plans, called the \u201cCadillac\u201d health plans, that had been scheduled to begin in 2018. Those taxes will now wait for two years.\n\nMedical device taxes are also paused for 2016 and 2017.\n\nOverall, the omnibus legislation combined 12 smaller appropriations measures for every U.S. government agency into one giant funding bill covering 2,000 pages.\n\nThe budget does not include monetary assistance for financially struggling Puerto Rico or pension security for coal miners and their dependents in the form of the Miners Protection Act, but it does tighten up requirements of the program allowing people from 38 countries to travel to the U.S. without a visa.\n\nThere are additional tax credits for solar and wind energy projects, coupled with a lifting of the decades-old ban on U.S. exports of crude oil.\n\nPrior to the U.S. Senate vote Friday, the U.S. House approved the spending bill with a 316-113 vote.\n\nAmong West Virginia\u2019s House members, 3rd District Congressman Evan Jenkins (R-W.Va.) voted in favor of the legislation, while 1st District Congressman David McKinley (R-W.Va.) and 2nd District Congressman Alex Mooney (R-W.Va) voted against it.\n\nMcKinley, Jenkins and Mooney all voted \u2018yes\u2019 on the $650 billion tax break package which was taken up separately in the U.S. House before being combined for one vote in the U.S. Senate.\n\nManchin said he could have supported the omnibus bill on its own.\n\nHe asked, \u201cDo you have to give away the whole darn store and, basically, put us in a situation which gives us very few tools to ever do an overhaul of the tax system?\u201d\n\nBoth Capito and Manchin talked about their votes on Monday\u2019s MetroNews \u201cTalkline.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is the beginning,\u201d said Capito of the budget. \u201cWe\u2019ve got lots we can do.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Both U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and U.S. Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) talked about their votes on Monday's MetroNews", "og": {"site_name": "WV MetroNews", "description": "Both U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and U.S. Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) talked about their votes on Monday\u2019s MetroNews \u201cTalkline.\u201d", "title": "Differing views of federal budget from West Virginia\u2019s U.S. Senators", "url": "http://wvmetronews.com/2015/12/21/differing-views-of-federal-budget-from-west-virginias-u-s-senators/", "image": {"width": 780, "identifier": "http://wvmetronews.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/US_Capitol.jpg", "height": 346}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://wvmetronews.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/US_Capitol.jpg?w=640", "site": "@wvmetronews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 439959236158130, "pages": 327490709044}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-21T17:51:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-21T17:51:00+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Other tax cuts that were made permanent include the research and experimentation tax credit, the American Opportunity Tax Credit for undergraduate tuition and allowances for seniors to continue tax-free charitable donations from Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs).\nSenator Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) sees more good than bad in the $1.1 trillion federal budget that will keep the U.S. government funded through Sept. 2016.\nAmong West Virginia\u2019s House members, 3rd District Congressman Evan Jenkins (R-W.Va.) voted in favor of the legislation, while 1st District Congressman David McKinley (R-W.Va.) and 2nd District Congressman Alex Mooney (R-W.Va) voted against it.\n\u201cObviously, it\u2019s not perfect, but there\u2019s a lot in there for West Virginia,\u201d Capito said.\nShe said many of those tax credits had been extended for years and are critical to thousands of West Virginians."}
