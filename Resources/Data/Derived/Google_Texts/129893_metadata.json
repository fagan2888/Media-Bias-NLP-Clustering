David Orme for the Wall Street Journal\n\nTHE DRIVE ACROSS New York City\u2014from my Brooklyn apartment to a leafy residential block at the outer edge of Queens\u2014was a journey in itself. Arriving at Sunny Kim's home just as her Korean cooking class was starting, I was actually a little nervous: Showing up at a private residence made the whole thing feel disarmingly intimate.\n\nNew York is a city of immigrants; a recent report from the mayor's office counted 37% of the population as foreign-born. It's also a great restaurant city. Still, though I love Korean food and spend a lot of time eating in Manhattan's Koreatown, how often do I have the opportunity to sit down to a home-cooked Korean meal? That's the experience that League of Kitchens, the organization that offers this class and others like it in the homes of immigrant cooks across New York City, aims to provide.\n\nPhotos: Cooking Korean Dishes Click to view slideshow. David Orme for the Wall Street Journal\n\nClasses With Immigrant Cooks Around the Country San Francisco: La Cocina This \"incubator kitchen\" in the Mission District was founded to help food entrepreneurs, many of them immigrant women, grow their businesses.

From $35 for classes of varying length, eatwith.com\n\nMs. Kim welcomed me with a cup of green tea and some pork-and-beef dumplings she'd made. A natural host, she was chatting with the other students\u2014we were five in all. We learned that Ms. Kim, the executive director of the Korean American Community Center of New York, and her husband, Kyong Nak Kim, a Methodist minister (now retired), emigrated from South Korea in 1983. In garden plots that ran around the side of the house, Mr. Kim grew produce that his wife used to make kimchi. She stored it in enormous clay crocks alongside the miso paste and soy sauce she fermented for months to get the right flavor. \"I didn't make soy sauce in Korea,\" she said. \"But when my mother-in-law passed away, I thought, 'Who will make it now?' I studied for three years to make it taste good.\"\n\nENLARGE Ms. Kim's scallion, meat and vegetable skewers David Orme for the Wall Street Journal\n\nIn other words, Ms. Kim was no ordinary home cook. \"We're looking for someone who has a deep knowledge of traditional cooking,\" said Lisa Gross, founder and CEO of League of Kitchens. During a lengthy audition process, Ms. Gross's team also vets the cooks' homes to make sure they're comfortable, clean and conveniently located. Candidates are given three months' paid teacher training, and Ms. Gross's colleague Liz Tarpy, formerly the senior culinary editor at Food Network, helps cooks who would never reach for a tablespoon or cup-measure under normal circumstances to translate their dishes into recipes that students can reproduce at home.\n\nOver five and a half hours at the Kims' house, we prepared a number of namul, or vegetable side dishes, as well as meat and vegetable skewers called sanjeok. The main course was a platter of galbi\u2014grilled beef short ribs. Ms. Kim would get a dish started, then hand it over to a student with a firm, encouraging, \"OK. Now you do it.\" Along the way, she kept us fortified with snacks and earthy ginseng tea. Still, we were hungry by the time we sat down to dinner along with Mr. Kim. My earlier nervousness was a dim memory. The meal was delicious\u2014and unlike anything to be found in a restaurant. We lingered over it like old friends.\n\nFrom $100 for classes in Korean, Indian, Bengali, Afghan, Lebanese and Greek cooking, leagueofkitchens.com\n\nGalbi (Korean Short Ribs)\n\nENLARGE Korean short ribs David Orme for the Wall Street Journal\n\nThe pur\u00e9ed Asian pear in the marinade not only contributes subtle sweetness, but also aids in tenderizing the meat. These ribs are even more delicious when barbecued on a grill.\n\nActive Time: 30 minutes Total Time: 2\u00bd hours (includes marinating) Serves: 4-6\n\nMake marinade: In a blender or food processor, pur\u00e9e 10 cloves garlic, 1 small onion, roughly chopped, \u00bc Asian pear, peeled and cut into chunks, and \u00bd cup water. Pour into a large bowl. Rinse blender or food processor with 3 tablespoons soju, sake or white wine and add to bowl. Stir in \u2153 cup soy sauce, 2\u00bd tablespoons honey, 2 tablespoons sesame oil and \u00bd teaspoon black pepper.\n\nMarinate short ribs: Submerge 2\u00bd pounds Korean-style short ribs (aka flanken-cut short ribs) in the marinade, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 2 hours and up to 6.\n\nCook short ribs: Heat broiler on high. Line a broiler pan with foil. Lay ribs across pan in a single layer. Broil ribs 10 minutes, flip and continue to broil until meat is well done, brown all over and crisped at the edges. Repeat with remaining ribs. Serve with rice.\n\n\u2014Adapted from Sunny Kim, League of Kitchens", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "article.created": "2014-04-04T21:17:00.000Z", "article.section": "Life and Style", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "Article", "twitter": {"domain": "wsj.com", "description": "You can venture to far-flung places without leaving your own city in a new crop of cosmopolitan cooking classes.", "creator": "@bethkracklauer", "image": {"src": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OD-BB710_CULINA_G_20140402104152.jpg", "alt": "Venture to far-flung places without leaving town in a new crop of cosmopolitan cooking classes", "identifier": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OD-BB710_CULINA_D_20140402104152.jpg"}, "title": "Travel on Your Stomach in Classes Taught by Immigrant Cooks", "site": "@WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "wsj://launch?articleid=SB10001424052702303978304579473924118243310&headline=Venture%20to%20far-flung%20places%20without%20leaving%20town%20in%20a%20new%20crop%20of%20cosmopolitan%20cooking%20classes&weburl=http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303978304579473924118243310"}}, "page.site.product": "WSJ", "keywords": "cooking classes san francisco,ethnic cooking classes,home cooking lessons,immigrant cooking classes,korean cooking class,los angeles cooking class,new york cooking class,seattle cooking class,political,general news,food,cooking review,drink,living,lifestyle,politics,international relations,domestic politics,recipes,routine general news,reviews", "news_keywords": "cooking classes san francisco,ethnic cooking classes,home cooking lessons,immigrant cooking classes,korean cooking class,los angeles cooking class,new york cooking class,seattle cooking class,political,general news", "article.headline": "Venture to far-flung places without leaving town in a new crop of cosmopolitan cooking classes", "cXenseParse": {"candybar": {"image": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OD-BB710_CULINA_E_20140402104152.jpg"}, "poptart": {"image": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OD-BB710_CULINA_D_20140402104152.jpg"}}, "description": "You can venture to far-flung places without leaving your own city in a new crop of cosmopolitan cooking classes.", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=364387007,app-argument=wsj://launch?articleid=SB10001424052702303978304579473924118243310&headline=Venture%20to%20far-flung%20places%20without%20leaving%20town%20in%20a%20new%20crop%20of%20cosmopolitan%20cooking%20classes&weburl=http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303978304579473924118243310", "user.type": "nonsubscriber", "article.page": "Life and Style", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.summary": "You can venture to far-flung places without leaving your own city in a new crop of cosmopolitan cooking classes.", "page.site": "wsj", "testkeys": "B", "article.published": "2014-04-04T21:17:00.000Z", "dj.asn": "i-c64c", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj", "embed_count": 5, "word_count": 723, "internal_link_count": 1, "image_count": 3, "external_link_count": 9}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Article", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "You can venture to far-flung places without leaving your own city in a new crop of cosmopolitan cooking classes.", "title": "Travel on Your Stomach in Classes Taught by Immigrant Cooks", "url": "http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303978304579473924118243310", "image": {"width": 553, "identifier": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OD-BB710_CULINA_G_20140402104152.jpg", "height": 369}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "author": "Beth Kracklauer", "article.access": "free", "page.content.source": "WSJ Online Article", "article.origheadline": "Travel on Your Stomach in Classes Taught by Immigrant Cooks", "article.type": "Food & Drink", "article.id": "SB10001424052702303978304579473924118243310", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-04-04T21:17:00.000Z"}, "article_summary": "Marinate short ribs: Submerge 2\u00bd pounds Korean-style short ribs (aka flanken-cut short ribs) in the marinade, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 2 hours and up to 6.\nMany of these are classes taught by immigrant cooks, in which students help to prepare the meal that they then sit down and eat.\nMs. Kim would get a dish started, then hand it over to a student with a firm, encouraging, \"OK.
