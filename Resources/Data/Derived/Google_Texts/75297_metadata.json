Denver was the sixth American diocese to which Father David Holley had transferred.\n\nA judge decided earlier this year that McManemy\u2019s federal court case should be heard in Colorado. He had filed a similar lawsuit on May 6 against dioceses in Massachusetts, Texas and New Mexico.\n\nMcManemy argued in the complaint that the Archdiocese of Denver suspected and hid Holley\u2019s sexual abuse, which enabled the priest to prey on him in New Mexico. His lawsuit seeks punitive damages.\n\n\u201cThis was an interstate conspiracy that each one of these dioceses willingly joined to harbor a known pedophile,\u201d said Merit Bennett, McManemy\u2019s lawyer.\n\nKarna Swanson, spokeswoman for the Archdiocese of Denver, said Holley was authorized to say Mass and hear confessions in the Denver region but that there were no records of his wrongdoing in Denver.\n\n\u201cHe worked for a year for a hospital here in town, and that\u2019s really all we know about him,\u201d Swanson said.\n\nMcManemy said the diocese could have removed Holley from church facilities but chose not to.\n\nMcManemy\u2019s lawsuit said that as an 11-year-old, he was raped by Holley in 1990 and sexually, physically and psychologically abused for three years before that by two priests at St. Jude\u2019s Catholic Parish in Alamogordo.\n\nIn 1993, Holley was sentenced to 275 years in prison for molesting eight boys in New Mexico.\n\n\u201cEverybody knew who this guy was,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cHe was one of the most inveterate predators of children in the United States.\u201d\n\nBennett said he has represented more than 100 victims of clergy sexual abuse since he began practicing law in 1975.\n\n\u201cThis is the worst of the worst,\u201d he said. \u201cThey allowed him to roam free \u2014 church to church, diocese to diocese, children to children. Not one of them picked up the phone and dialed 911, including Denver.\u201d\n\nAlison Noon: 303-954-1223, anoon@denverpost.com or twitter.com/alisonnoon", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Lawsuit accuses Denver Archdiocese of allowing sexual abuse", "title": "Lawsuit accuses Denver Archdiocese of allowing sexual abuse", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/12/23/lawsuit-accuses-denver-archdiocese-of-allowing-sexual-abuse/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2013-12-23T18:48:26+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-12-23T18:48:26+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf624\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThey allowed him to roam free \u2014 church to church, diocese to diocese, children to children.\nMcManemy argued in the complaint that the Archdiocese of Denver suspected and hid Holley\u2019s sexual abuse, which enabled the priest to prey on him in New Mexico.\nKarna Swanson, spokeswoman for the Archdiocese of Denver, said Holley was authorized to say Mass and hear confessions in the Denver region but that there were no records of his wrongdoing in Denver.\nHe had filed a similar lawsuit on May 6 against dioceses in Massachusetts, Texas and New Mexico.\nAn Albuquerque man has filed a lawsuit against the Archdiocese of Denver, claiming the arm of the Catholic Church turned a blind eye in the 1980s on a priest who molested children across the country."}
