Justice Sonia Sotomayor was mentioned by name as she is the point person for emergency requests from the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\n\n\n\"The injunction means that the Little Sisters will not be forced to sign and deliver the controversial government forms authorizing and instructing their benefits administrator to provide contraceptives, sterilization, and drugs and devices that may cause early abortions,\" the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, representing the Sisters, said in a statement.\n\n\n\nJoin in the fight against World Hunger by going here --\n\n\n\n\"The court's order also provides protection to more than 400 other Catholic organizations that receive health benefits through the same Catholic benefits provider, Christian Brothers,\" the Becket Fund added.\n\n\n\nIn order to qualify, the Little Sisters need to put \"in writing that they are non-profit organizations that hold themselves out as religious and have religious objections to providing coverage for contraceptive services,\" the injunction read. The Little Sisters of the Poor now need to inform the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Kathleen Sebelius.\n\n\n\nThe order further says, \"To meet the condition for injunction pending appeal, applicants need not use the form prescribed by the Government and need not send copies to third-party administrators.\"\n\n\n\nThe news is being welcomed by representatives for the Little Sisters. \"We are delighted that the Supreme Court has issued this order protecting the Little Sisters,\" Mark Rienzi, senior counsel for the Becket Fund says. \"The government has lots of ways to deliver contraceptives to people-it doesn't need to force nuns to participate.\"\n\n\n\n\"The Little Sisters are joined in the lawsuit by religious health benefit providers, Christian Brothers Services, Christian Brothers Employee Benefits Trust. The lawsuit is a class action on behalf of all the non-exempt organizations that receive benefits through Christian Brothers. The Plaintiffs are also represented by Locke Lord, a national law firm, and by Kevin Walsh, a law professor at the University of Richmond,\" the Becket Fund explains in its statement.\n\n\n\n\"To date, there are currently 91 lawsuits challenging the unconstitutional HHS mandate,\" reads the statement.\n\n\n\n\"The Becket Fund represents: Hobby Lobby, Little Sisters of the Poor, GuideStone, Wheaton College, East Texas Baptist University, Houston Baptist University, Colorado Christian University, the Eternal Word Television Network, Ave Maria University, and Belmont Abbey College.\"\n\n\n\nThe mandate has been a sore spot for many organizations as it demands that nearly all Americans, both businesses and individuals, carry health insurance that offers contraceptives, sterilization and abortion-inducing drugs without co-payments, regardless of potential religious or moral objections.\n\n\n\nPope Francis calls for your 'prayer and action'...\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright 2016 - Distributed by THE CALIFORNIA NETWORKRespect for Women: That in every country of the world, women may be honored and respected and that their essential contribution to society may be highly esteemed.Holy Rosary: That families, communities, and groups may pray the Holy Rosary for evangelization and peace.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Catholic Online U.S. News.
