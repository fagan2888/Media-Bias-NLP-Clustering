A family dog made it out of the house, along with the occupants, but as many as three cats were also in the house, and witnesses said they didn\u2019t see if they made it out.\n\n\n\nFamily members told neighbors and other bystanders that they had no idea how the fire started.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey had a hard time calling the fire department at first, because they had no reception [on their cellphones],\u201d said Aubrey Baratta, an area resident who was nearby when the fire started, of the family members who fled the burning building. \u201cThe firefighters got there so fast, but I would say probably three-quarters of [the house] was already hit.\u201d\n\n\n\nEast Hampton Town Fire Marshal David Browne said the cause of the fire is still under investigation, but that it does not appear to be suspicious in nature. \u201cWe know the origin was reported early on as being from a garbage can,\u201d he said by phone on January 6.\n\n\n\nBy the time firefighters arrived, flames had already broken through the roof of the house, East Hampton Fire Department Chief Richard Osterberg said. He said it appeared as though the fire had started in the garage of the house and was spread quickly by the stiff northerly breezes blowing through the bayfront neighborhood on New Year\u2019s Day.\n\n\n\nChief Osterberg, who had been attending the swearing-in ceremony for new chiefs at the Springs Fire Department, said that he could already see the smoke from the fire as he raced down Three Mile Harbor Road.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere was a good wind blowing, and it just pushed [the fire] through the house,\u201d Chief Osterberg said. \u201cIt was a newer house, so there are a lot of composites, not wood framing \u2026 they burn a lot hotter than traditional wood does. And there were two cars in the garage burning as well. Thank God everyone got out of the house.\u201d\n\n\n\nChief Osterberg said that ultimately the fire became so intense that he had to pull his firefighters out of the interior of the structure, which was showing signs of collapsing.\n\n\n\nIn all, some 100 firefighters from six departments\u2014including Springs, Sag Harbor, Montauk, Amagansett and Bridgehampton in addition to East Hampton\u2014were either on the scene or on standby. Even after the last apparent flames had been extinguished, the East Hampton Fire Department had to hire excavating equipment from Keith Grimes Inc. to scoop out debris from the foundation, to ensure that there were no smoldering embers in the rubble of the former house.", "article_metadata": {"title": "Fire In East Hampton Garage Spreads Rapidly, Destroys House - East Hampton - 27east", "og": {"url": "http://www.27east.com/news/article.cfm/General-Interest-EH/92387/Family-Flees-Flames-In-East-Hampton", "image": "http://www.27east.com/assets/Article/92387/6218%5F7x%2EJPG", "type": "article", "description": "A family fled their vacation home in East Hampton\u2019s Northwest on New Year\u2019s Day as a wind-whipped fire that started", "title": "Fire In East Hampton Garage Spreads Rapidly, Destroys House - East Hampton"}, "robots": "INDEX,FOLLOW", "revisit-after": "1 days", "keywords": "", "distribution": "Global"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdad57\"", "article_summary": "By the time firefighters arrived, flames had already broken through the roof of the house, East Hampton Fire Department Chief Richard Osterberg said.\nFamily members told neighbors and other bystanders that they had no idea how the fire started.\n\u201cThere was a good wind blowing, and it just pushed [the fire] through the house,\u201d Chief Osterberg said.\n\u201cIt was a newer house, so there are a lot of composites, not wood framing \u2026 they burn a lot hotter than traditional wood does.\nIn all, some 100 firefighters from six departments\u2014including Springs, Sag Harbor, Montauk, Amagansett and Bridgehampton in addition to East Hampton\u2014were either on the scene or on standby."}
