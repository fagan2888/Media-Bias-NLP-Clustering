From 2011 through 2014, the number of healthcare ETFs ranking among a particular year\u2019s top 10 non-leveraged sector ETFs averaged close to four.\n\nThat number is easily being exceeded this year as seven of the top 10 sector ETFs and six of the top 10 non-leveraged ETFs overall are healthcare funds. The Health Care Select Sector SPDR (NYSEArca: XLV) is continuing its outperformance of the broader market and is the top performer among the nine sector SPDR ETFs on a year-to-date basis after placing second last year. [Healthcare ETFs can Keep Soaring]\n\nHealthcare stocks and ETFs have exceled over both short- and long-term time horizons.\n\n\u201cFor the decade ended March 6, 2015, the health-care sector category posted average annualized returns of 13.8%, or more than 6 percentage points above the S&P 500\u2019s 7.5% annualized return during that same interval. Over shorter time frames, the sector also has performed very well, returning 21.3% annualized during the past five years, 30.2% during the past three years, 24.0% during the past year, and 7.0% year to date. In every time period, the health-care Morningstar Category average has far outpaced the broad U.S. large-cap benchmark,\u201d writes Morningstar analyst Robert Goldsborough in a recent research note.\n\nOver the past year, 25 members of the Dow Jones Industrial Average have traded, four of which are healthcare names. Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ), Merck (NYSE: MRK) and Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) combine for 16.6% of XLV\u2019s weight. UnitedHealth (NYSE: UNH) along with Pfizer are two of just four Dow stocks with 10% year-to-date gains. UnitedHealth is the largest holding in the iShares U.S. Healthcare Providers ETF (NYSEArca: IHF), one of this year\u2019s best-performing health care ETFs.\n\nIHF is one of an array of healthcare ETFs that have regularly been hitting all-time highs since the start of the year, fighting off concerns about the Supreme Court hearing challenges to the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, this month. [Some Soaring Healthcare ETFs]\n\n\u201cWhy has the health-care sector done so well? Some of it relates to low valuations in 2009 and 2010 of pharmaceutical stocks, which make up anywhere from 40% to 45% of the sector. At that time, investors worried about the impact of U.S. health-care reform and a wave of major patent losses that peaked in 2012,\u201d according to Morningstar.\n\nMorningstar also highlighted the Vanguard Health Care ETF (NYSEArca: VHT) as another healthcare ETF to consider as the sector rallies on rampant mergers and acquisitions activity and favorable FDA news.\n\n\u201cVHT holds 323 health-care stocks, while XLV is a much more concentrated portfolio representing just 56 companies. VHT also dips further down the market-cap ladder than XLV, devoting 14% of assets to mid-cap firms and 7% of assets to small-cap companies. XLV, by contrast, invests just 7% of assets in mid-cap health players and has no small-cap allocation,\u201d notes Morningstar.\n\nSince the March2009 market bottom, XLV and VHT have surged an average of 279%. Investors have allocated $595.2 million in new money to XLV this year and $519 million to VHT.\n\nHealth Care Select Sector SPDR", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "sector etfs,health care etfs,pfizer,johnson & johnson,healthcare providers etf,johnson & johnson,feature stories,featured,ihf,lead,vht,xlv", "google-site-verification": "Q-wAoS5rW2yMYxQN_OT0klqLjkfU6a6rxznKurdUlsY", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.etftrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/favicon-1.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd4ee\"", "article_summary": "From 2011 through 2014, the number of healthcare ETFs ranking among a particular year\u2019s top 10 non-leveraged sector ETFs averaged close to four.\nUnitedHealth is the largest holding in the iShares U.S. Healthcare Providers ETF (NYSEArca: IHF), one of this year\u2019s best-performing health care ETFs.\n[Healthcare ETFs can Keep Soaring]Healthcare stocks and ETFs have exceled over both short- and long-term time horizons.\nHealth Care Select Sector SPDR\nThat number is easily being exceeded this year as seven of the top 10 sector ETFs and six of the top 10 non-leveraged ETFs overall are healthcare funds."}
