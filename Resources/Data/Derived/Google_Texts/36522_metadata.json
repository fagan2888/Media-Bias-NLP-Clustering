Jose Aserto CC-BY-ND 2.0\n\nWhen a 61-year-old man from Texas showed up to a nearby hospital complaining about feeling drunk, though he had not taken a sip of alcohol that day, doctors wrote it off as closet alcoholism. After blowing 0.37 percent on a breathalyzer test while insisting he had not been drinking, the former home brewer drew the attention of gastroenterologists Dr. Barbara Cordell and Dr. Justin McCarthy.\n\n\"He would get drunk out of the blue \u2014 on a Sunday morning after being at church, or really, just anytime,\" Cordell explained. \"His wife was so dismayed about it that she even bought a Breathalyzer.\"\n\nThe research team made sure that the man was not in possession of any liquor and isolated him in a hospital room for a period of 24 hours. Even after consuming only food rich in carbohydrates, the man still ended up with a 0.12 blood alcohol content on his blood test.\n\nDuring further testing, Cordell and McCarthy discovered a buildup of a certain type of yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, in the man\u2019s intestinal tract. The condition, dubbed gut fermentation syndrome or auto-brewery syndrome, causes starch to ferment sugar and thus produces ethanol. Essentially, the man\u2019s stomach was his own brewery.\n\nThe man was finally cured with a low-carbohydrate diet and a steady regimen of antifungals to help combat the yeast buildup. The book Alcohol in Health and Disease identifies a case in Japan that involved 39 women who suffered from an intestinal abnormality that caused them to become intoxicated after a meal high in carbohydrates.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "drunk without alcohol, texas man, gut, fermentation, auto, brewery, syndrome, yeast", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A 61-year-old Texas man who can get drunk without even touching alcohol has sparked the interest of gastroenterologists.", "title": "Texas Man Can Get Drunk Without Alcohol, Due To Auto-Brewery Syndrome", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/texas-man-can-get-drunk-without-alcohol-due-auto-brewery-syndrome-can-you-brew-beer-your-own-stomach", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/18/auto-brewery-syndrome.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A 61-year-old Texas man who can get drunk without even touching alcohol has sparked the interest of gastroenterologists.", "title": "Texas Man Can Get Drunk Without Alcohol, Due To Auto-Brewery Syndrome", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/texas-man-can-get-drunk-without-alcohol-due-auto-brewery-syndrome-can-you-brew-beer-your-own-stomach", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/18/auto-brewery-syndrome.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/18/auto-brewery-syndrome.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2013-09-18T13:30:20-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-18T13:30:19-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A 61-year-old Texas man who can get drunk without even touching alcohol has sparked the interest of gastroenterologists."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc184\"", "article_summary": "A 61-year-old Texas man who can get drunk without even touching alcohol has sparked the interest of gastroenterologists.\nThe condition, dubbed gut fermentation syndrome or auto-brewery syndrome, causes starch to ferment sugar and thus produces ethanol.\nJose Aserto CC-BY-ND 2.0When a 61-year-old man from Texas showed up to a nearby hospital complaining about feeling drunk, though he had not taken a sip of alcohol that day, doctors wrote it off as closet alcoholism.\nThe man was finally cured with a low-carbohydrate diet and a steady regimen of antifungals to help combat the yeast buildup.\nEven after consuming only food rich in carbohydrates, the man still ended up with a 0.12 blood alcohol content on his blood test."}
