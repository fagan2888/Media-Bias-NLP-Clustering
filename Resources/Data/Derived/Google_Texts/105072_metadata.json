Craig Estes, who heads the panel, relented. Estes, R-Wichita Falls, asked a Democratic colleague to invite a couple of the law\u2019s backers to testify at Monday\u2019s hearing at the Capitol.\n\nAn Estes aide downplayed the episode, but it highlights a dread that is increasingly on the minds of Democrats and liberal activists: Next year, the Senate very likely will tilt more to the right.\n\nIn January, at least six and possibly as many as eight staunchly conservative freshmen will take seats in the 31-member chamber, already controlled by Republicans.\n\nIf, as expected, Republican Sen. Dan Patrick of Houston wins the November election for lieutenant governor, the freshman firebrands at least will begin the legislative session expecting to have a sympathetic presiding officer.\n\nPatrick\u2019s rapid political ascent may have underlain Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst\u2019s assignment about Obamacare to the Senate State Affairs Committee. Dewhurst issued what Democrats describe as an inflammatory \u201cinterim charge\u201d on Feb. 6, as he and Patrick were battling for the GOP nomination for the No. 2 job.\n\nCharges are the presiding officer\u2019s direction for legislative committees to examine issues while lawmakers are out of session. They often form the basis of major bills considered the next time lawmakers meet.\n\nDewhurst asked Estes\u2019 panel to study \u201cemerging negative impacts\u201d of the federal law. He mentioned possible increases in premiums, narrow provider networks, harm to the state economy and potential misbehavior by the federally paid workers who help people sign up for insurance coverage online, known as \u201cnavigators.\u201d\n\nSuspicious timing?\n\nDewhurst issued the directive because of constituent complaints about Obamacare and not to score points with staunchly conservative primary voters, said spokesman Andrew Barlow.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been engaged with those issues all along,\u201d Barlow said.\n\nSupporters of the federal law scoffed.\n\n\u201cWe all know when the charge was written,\u201d Sen. Rodney Ellis, a Houston Democrat, said Friday, referring to the tough primary fight that Dewhurst would ultimately lose.\n\nThe activist group Texas Organizing Project arranged a press call with Ellis and others Friday to highlight those who would be missing from the Senate hearing. A Houston navigator praised the law. A Richardson woman said her family finally found an affordable policy in the marketplace.\n\nA Houston home health care aide, who\u2019s too poor to receive federal subsidies in the marketplace, pleaded for state leaders to take advantage of federal financial incentives to expand Medicaid. As the law was designed, she would have gained coverage there.\n\nEllis said he wished Estes would take testimony from the public at Monday\u2019s hearing. Rep. Garnet Coleman, another Houston Democrat on the call, questioned the GOP game plan for the hearing.\n\n\u201cThat does nothing to bring us to a place of common ground,\u201d Coleman said.\n\nEstes spokesman Noe Barrios said that as soon as the senator learned of the press call, he quickly invited Ellis to choose two Obamacare supporters who would be allowed to testify.\n\nEarlier, Estes\u2019 committee staff members announced that the only speakers would be officials from the Texas Department of Insurance, four business and professional groups, a conservative think tank and a liberal think tank.\n\nResearcher Phillip Martin of Progress Texas, which calls itself a \u201cprogressive nonprofit\u201d group, said the episode underscores why many people who care a lot about expanding access to health care are anxious about the next legislative session \u2014 and especially about what the Senate will do.\n\n\u201cIf we rely on demagoguing to the basest instincts of the Republican Party, we\u2019re going to continue to fall behind,\u201d Martin said. \u201cThe question for 2015 is whether health care policy experts will write health care policy or political consultants will write policy.\u201d\n\n\u2018Wishful thinking\u2019\n\nAnalyst John Davidson of the free market-oriented Texas Public Policy Foundation, though, said the federal law\u2019s supporters are guilty of \u201cwishful thinking\u201d as they gush about its benefits.\n\nTexas\u2019 federally run, online marketplace has underperformed, signing up only 3 percent of the state\u2019s 6 million uninsured residents, said Davidson, one of those invited to speak at Monday\u2019s hearing.\n\nPremiums are too high for most people eligible to buy in the marketplace, he said, and a looming requirement that employers provide coverage is slowing economic growth.\n\n\u201cEmployers are saying, \u2018We\u2019re not hiring as many people as we would be because of the [law]. We\u2019re hiring more part-time workers,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nThe subject of insurance navigators sparked much talk last year but probably won\u2019t dominate the hearing.\n\nDewhurst has stressed that, if federal safeguards alone had been in place, the navigators could have included convicted felons and poorly trained people who might mishandle Texas consumers\u2019 confidential information.\n\nAt the urging of state GOP leaders, Gov. Rick Perry ordered the Insurance Department to require state licensing of navigators. In late January, Insurance Commissioner Julia Rathgeber issued requirements that applicants be fingerprinted, undergo more extensive background checks and receive 20 hours of additional training.\n\nFederal officials and supporters of the federal law said state leaders merely wanted to suppress participation in the marketplace. Experts who closely track the navigators\u2019 activity have said that ultimately, there were no reported cases of identity theft or harm caused by navigators.\n\nOn Friday, Insurance Department spokesman John Greeley said the agency hasn\u2019t disciplined any of the more than 200 navigators currently registered. Nor has it revoked anyone\u2019s registration, he said.\n\nSince Rathgeber issued her rules, the department has received no complaints about navigators, Greeley said. He noted, though, that 28 applications were withdrawn.\n\n\u201cOne of the drivers of withdrawn applications are questions related to review of the individual\u2019s criminal background,\u201d Greeley said. He didn\u2019t say how many times that happened.\n\nBarlow, the Dewhurst spokesman, said the lack of trouble proves state leaders\u2019 wisdom.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a deterrent effect,\u201d he said. \u201cBy raising the alarm \u2026 it helped protect Texans.\u201d\n\nFollow Robert T.
