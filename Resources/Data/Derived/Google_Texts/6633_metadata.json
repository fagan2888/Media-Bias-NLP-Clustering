Actually, there has been no real recovery, but a continual deterioration of living standards despite the lies and distortions from the financial media and government authorities.\n\nConditions, however, are now descending at an even faster pace.\n\nRecently, the leading manufacturer of heavy equipment, Caterpillar, announced that job cuts would exceed 10,000 through 2018. Up to 5,000 employees will receive pink slips between now and the end of 2016. Retail sales for the manufacturing giant have slumped 11% between June and August.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nWhile Caterpillar\u2019s contraction is an ominous sign, a more telling indicator of worsening economic conditions came from the Federal Reserve\u2019s refusal to raise interest rates at its latest FOMC meeting. Many commentators had speculated that the Fed would raise rates at least a quarter of one percent on the belief that the economy was strengthening.\n\nThe Fed, of course, based its refusal to raise rates on \u201cinternational concerns\u201d \u2013 China\u2019s stock market selloff. The real reason is that the nation\u2019s central bank understands, although it will not publicly admit it, that the economy is far too weak to \u201cabsorb\u201d a rate hike, no matter how infinitesimal.\n\nMore importantly, the Fed cannot raise rates to any significant degree because the entire financial system, which is built on \u201ccheap money,\u201d would immediately plunge into a significant downturn similar to that of 2008, or worse. The federal government and many of the states and municipalities would default since they could not continue to finance their current profligate borrowing and spending patterns with higher interest rates.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nThus, the Fed is trapped in a world of zero interest rates for the foreseeable future. As economic conditions continue to worsen, the central bank will more than likely turn to another round of money printing like its infamous \u201cQE\u201d program.\n\nWhile the Fed is locked into a zero interest rate policy, the Obama Administration and Congress remain oblivious to economic reality. A few years back, Obama and the one-time Democratically-controlled Congress tried a \u201cstimulus\u201d program which did nothing but increase the national debt. Also weighing down the economy is the disastrous Obamacare program, which will only become more burdensome as time passes.\n\nJust as troubling, none of the current crop of presidential hopefuls, with one possible exception, has proposed or suggested any credible measure that will improve matters. None of the fundamental problems that are crippling the economy have been seriously addressed.\n\nThe reason why there has been no recovery is that the malinvestments and bubbles created during the last boom have not been allowed to contract and/or burst. Instead, the Fed pumped massive amounts of \u201cliquidity\u201d (money printing) into the markets, which kept these institutions (mostly banks) and their assets afloat.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nA credit implosion will not come about \u201cvoluntarily.\u201d The Fed will not increase interest rates, nor will the Obama Administration or Congress have the courage to cut spending to relieve pressure on the Fed to finance its unsustainable deficits and continue to inflate the stock market.\n\nInstead, there eventually will be a monetary crisis surrounding the dollar, which will force interest rates to rise, which will lead to widespread defaults and bankruptcies and an ensuing depression which will dwarf every previous economic downturn in American history.\n\nAlternative financial analysts have, for some time, pointed to the declining living standards not only in the U.S., but throughout the Western world. Egon von Greyerz of Matterhorn Asset Management has predicted some very unpleasant times in the not too distant future: \u201cThe coming years will not be easy. I wrote an article a few years ago called \u2018The Dark Ages Are Here\u2019 and I now really think they are imminent. These will be difficult times for most of us.\u201d\n\nUltimately, the only way the U.S. economy will be turned around is through a change in ideology. The ideas and policies upon which not only the U.S. but the entire Western world\u2019s economies are predicated upon must be debunked. Until the principles and beliefs of the current economic system are intellectually discredited, the U.S. economy will continue to stagnate and eventually collapse.\n\nFollow me on Twitter.\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by the owners of this website.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Actually, there has been no real recovery, but a continual deterioration of living standards despite the lies and distortions from the financial media and government authorities.", "author": "Antonius Aquinas", "og": {"site_name": "Western Journalism", "description": "Actually, there has been no real recovery, but a continual deterioration of living standards despite the lies and distortions from the financial media and government authorities.", "title": "U.S. Economy Deteriorating At An Even Faster Pace", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1000, "identifier": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/shutterstock_222173743.jpg", "height": 667}, "url": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/u-s-economy-deteriorating-at-an-even-faster-pace/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Actually, there has been no real recovery, but a continual deterioration of living standards despite the lies and distortions from the financial media and government authorities.", "title": "U.S. Economy Deteriorating At An Even Faster Pace", "image": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/shutterstock_222173743.jpg", "creator": "@WestJournalism", "site": "@WestJournalism", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "DC.date.issued": "2015-10-13T17:35:01-07:00", "fb": {"app_id": 275784739127435, "pages": 123624513983}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/android-chrome-192x192.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WesternJournalism", "section": "Opinion", "tag": "Unemployment", "published_time": "2015-10-13T17:35:01-07:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "economics, federal reserve, inflation, unemployment, politics, nation, religion"}, "article_summary": "Many commentators had speculated that the Fed would raise rates at least a quarter of one percent on the belief that the economy was strengthening.\nUntil the principles and beliefs of the current economic system are intellectually discredited, the U.S. economy will continue to stagnate and eventually collapse.\nThe Fed, of course, based its refusal to raise rates on \u201cinternational concerns\u201d \u2013 China\u2019s stock market selloff.\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues belowThus, the Fed is trapped in a world of zero interest rates for the foreseeable future.\nConditions, however, are now descending at an even faster pace."}
