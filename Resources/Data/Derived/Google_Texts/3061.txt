CBS News correspondent Lara Logan formally apologized on “CBS This Morning” today for the erroneous report aired on “60 Minutes” Oct. 27.

Her apology follows the Nov. 7 acknowledgment by CBS that new information had “undercut” its controversial report on Benghzai.

“We were wrong. We made a mistake,” Logan said. She will further apologize and correct the record on “60 Minutes” Sunday.

Logan said the flawed report’s main source, Dylan Davies, led the program to believe that he was telling the truth about his role in events that took place on the night of the Benghazi attack– including her heroic climbing of the compound wall, fighting off a terrorist, etc. — but that “we now know that was not the case.” As other media outlets have reported, the contractor Davies was nowhere near the diplomatic outpost.
