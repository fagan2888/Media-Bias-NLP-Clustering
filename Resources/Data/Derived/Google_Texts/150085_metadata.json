Or even worse, he was told there were libertarians who were going to be. Or even worse, he was told young people were going to be there.\u201d\n\nThe gathering of several thousand conservatives, who offered Cruz a raucous standing ovation several times during his remarks, ate up the senator\u2019s criticisms. When a small number of Trump supporters tried to start chanting the GOP front-runner\u2019s name, they were quickly drowned out by a chorus of boos.\n\nTrump unexpectedly announced Friday that he would skip his scheduled speech here Saturday morning, opting instead to hold a rally in Kansas. He holds a strong edge in the delegate count over both Cruz and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, and many Republicans now believe the only way to stop him from winning the nomination is to deny him it at a contested convention this July.\n\nBut if the delegate math isn\u2019t kind to Cruz, his supporters here didn\u2019t seem to care. The senator offered an impassioned denunciation of Obamacare, Hillary Clinton, and \u2013 of course \u2013 Trump, including mocking the billionaire candidate\u2019s admission during Thursday\u2019s debate that he\u2019s proud to be flexible about his agenda.\n\n\u201cLet me tell you everyone at CPAC, \u2018flexible\u2019 is code word in Washington, D.C., that they\u2019re getting ready to stick it to you,\u201d Cruz said.\n\nCruz was more reserved when asked by Fox News host Sean Hannity what he thought of Mitt Romney\u2019s criticism of Trump during a speech Thursday. Romney, Cruz said, is a \u201ccitizen\u201d \u201centitled to express views.\u201d\n\n\u201cI come from a different place than Mitt does, but the concern Mitt is expressing is the concern\u201d shared by a lot of Americans, Cruz said.\n\nAsked by Hannity about Clinton and the investigation into her private email server, Cruz started cracking jokes.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never had a general election convened at Leavenworth,\u201d Cruz said, referring to the federal prison in Kansas. \u201cBut this year might be a first.\u201d\n\nHannity quipped that he hopes the prison had \u201corange jump suits.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, Sean,\u201d Cruz retorted, \u201corange is the new Democratic blue.\u201d\n\nRelated: Carson 'Leaving the Campaign Trail' Kasich Says Smears Won't Work on Trump Trump to Skip CPAC for Kansas Rally Roll Call Race Ratings Map: Ratings for Every House and Senate Race in 2016 Get breaking news alerts and more from Roll Call in your inbox or on your iPhone.", "article_metadata": {"description": "NATIONAL HARBOR, Md. \u2013 Ted Cruz wasted no time tearing into Donald Trump\u2019s decision to skip his planned weekend appearance at the Conservative Political Action Conference, opening his speech Friday to sarcastically offer a set of explanations for his rival\u2019s impending absence.", "og": {"site_name": "Roll Call", "description": "NATIONAL HARBOR, Md. \u2013 Ted Cruz wasted no time tearing into Donald Trump\u2019s decision to skip his planned weekend appearance at the Conservative Political Action Conference, opening his speech Friday to sarcastically offer a set of explanations for his rival\u2019s impending absence.", "title": "Cruz Mocks Absent Trump in CPAC Speech", "url": "http://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/cruz-mocks-absent-trump-in-cpac-speech", "image": {"identifier": "http://cdn.images.rollcall.com/image/1ed71e81ff466910ac598f06d393a96c/atr/CPAC2016_122_030416-445x287.jpg", "type": "image/png"}, "updated_time": "2016-03-05T02:40:36Z", "type": "website"}, "abstract": "NATIONAL HARBOR, Md. \u2013 Ted Cruz wasted no time tearing into Donald Trump\u2019s decision to skip his planned weekend appearance at the Conservative Political Action Conference, opening his speech Friday to sarcastically offer a set of explanations for his rival\u2019s impending absence.", "fb": {"app_id": 1383531991672364}, "keywords": "Blog ID,Author,author,category,category,category,category,CQToday Topic,Post Type,donald-trump,primaries,republicans,ted-cruz,poli", "article": {"section": "politics", "published_time": "2016-03-05T02:40:36Z", "modified_time": "2016-03-05T02:40:36Z"}, "twitter": {"description": "NATIONAL HARBOR, Md. \u2013 Ted Cruz wasted no time tearing into Donald Trump\u2019s decision to skip his planned weekend appearance at the Conservative Political Action Conference, opening his speech Fri", "title": "Cruz Mocks Absent Trump in CPAC Speech", "url": "http://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/cruz-mocks-absent-trump-in-cpac-speech", "image": {"src": "http://cdn.images.rollcall.com/image/1ed71e81ff466910ac598f06d393a96c/atr/CPAC2016_122_030416-445x287.jpg"}, "site": "@rollcall", "card": "summary |player (See: https://dev.twitter.com/cards/types/player We will have to submit a test and get approval before using this type)"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "When a small number of Trump supporters tried to start chanting the GOP front-runner\u2019s name, they were quickly drowned out by a chorus of boos.\nCruz was more reserved when asked by Fox News host Sean Hannity what he thought of Mitt Romney\u2019s criticism of Trump during a speech Thursday.\nTrump unexpectedly announced Friday that he would skip his scheduled speech here Saturday morning, opting instead to hold a rally in Kansas.\nBut if the delegate math isn\u2019t kind to Cruz, his supporters here didn\u2019t seem to care.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never had a general election convened at Leavenworth,\u201d Cruz said, referring to the federal prison in Kansas."}
