Then watchdogs track progress for the rest of the year. Once the problem areas are resolved, they come off the list. More than a third of the high-risk areas that have been noted since 1990 have been removed after significant progress was made to address the problems, says GAO.\n\nRelated: Two Decades of Waste, Fraud and Abuse\u2014Still No Fix\n\nHowever, there aren\u2019t many consequences for agencies that don\u2019t improve \u2026 except for cementing a spot on the High Risk List.\n\nSome, like the Defense Department, have been on the list for years \u2013 for such problem areas as weapons acquisitions and financial management (DOD hasn\u2019t been successfully audited in decades). Medicare, Medicaid and the U.S. Postal Service also frequent the list.\n\nThis year\u2019s list has some new additions, including the Veterans Affairs hospital systems, which earned a spot after the agency was embroiled in scandal over backlogged and hidden wait lists last year. Overall, the 2015 High Risk list includes 32 programs \u2013 up from 30 last year. Here are five of the most troubled areas of the federal government:\n\nIT Operations and Acquisitions\n\nThe government invests $80 billion annually in information technology, but so far its track record for undertaking massive IT efforts isn\u2019t great. Take, for example, Health and Human Services Department\u2019s HealthCare.gov, which struggled through an embarrassing launch that resulted in a costly repair effort. Now the project has ballooned to over $2 billion.\n\nRelated: 5 Most Egregious Examples of Government Waste This Year\n\nThere\u2019s also the abandoned $1.1 billion electronic health record system that didn\u2019t work. GAO blamed these tech flops on management and planning. \u201cWe have previously testified that the federal government has spent billions of dollars on failed IT investments. These and other failed IT projects often suffered from a lack of disciplined and effective management, such as project planning, requirements definition, and program oversight and governance,\u201d GAO said in the report.\n\nVeterans Affairs Health Care\n\nAfter a year of scandal at the VA, where officials were accused of keeping secret wait lists and hiding poor treatment of veterans, it\u2019s no surprise the $55.5 billion health care program serving more than 8.9 million veterans is considered \u201chigh risk.\u201d GAO said it issued eight reports on the VA health system last year detailing delays, lax oversight and mismanagement.\n\nIRS Tax Law Enforcement\n\nTax enforcement has made the High Risk List each year since 1990 \u2013 for good reason. The tax gap (the difference between taxes owed and taxes paid) is an astounding $385 billion. This year, GAO expanded the risk area to include the IRS\u2019s efforts to combat tax fraud. Last year, the IRS paid out $5.8 billion in fraudulent tax refunds \u2013 though it prevented another $24.2 billion from being lost to identify fraud. Budget cuts, it says, could hamper its efforts to combat this.\n\nSecurity of Federal Information Systems and Cyber Infrastructure\n\nCyber security has long been called a high risk area, though GAO expanded the threat in 2003 to include the protection of critical cyber infrastructure. This year, it\u2019s added privacy protection as a concern.\n\nRelated: The Cyber Attack That Could Take Down the Government\n\nWhile the government has taken steps to improve protecting cyber assets, technology advances have made it easier for virtually anyone to collect and process personal information \u2013 which poses \u201cchallenges to ensuring the privacy of such information,\u201d said GAO. The growing number of high-profile breaches in the private sector \u2013 such as Sony\u2019s \u2013 as well as more security incidents involving personal information at federal agencies has further raised the risk.\n\nPentagon Weapon Systems Acquisition\n\nDOD\u2019s weapon systems acquisition process has been on the GAO\u2019s risk list since 1990 and continues to fall short on cost-effectiveness, schedule management and performance expectations, the report said. The pricey F-35 or Joint Strike Fighter, for example, estimated to cost more than $1.5 trillion, has already gone hundreds of billions over budget, is far behind schedule and has fallen short of expectations. It\u2019s still never flown in combat.\n\nClick here to see the GAO\u2019S full High Risk List.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Each year, federal watchdogs at the Government Accountability Office publish a", "title": "5 Government Programs That Abuse Taxpayers\u2019 Money", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/12/5-Government-Programs-Abuse-Taxpayer-s-Money", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/05172013_IRS_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/12/5-Government-Programs-Abuse-Taxpayer-s-Money", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/05172013_IRS_article.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@Briannaehley"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Each year, federal watchdogs at the Government Accountability Office publish a", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdde30\"", "article_summary": "Overall, the 2015 High Risk list includes 32 programs \u2013 up from 30 last year.\nClick here to see the GAO\u2019S full High Risk List.\nRelated: Two Decades of Waste, Fraud and Abuse\u2014Still No FixHowever, there aren\u2019t many consequences for agencies that don\u2019t improve \u2026 except for cementing a spot on the High Risk List.\nIRS Tax Law EnforcementTax enforcement has made the High Risk List each year since 1990 \u2013 for good reason.\nThe GAO\u2019S \u201cHigh Risk List\u201d gets sent to Congress at the start of each year, accompanied by a lengthy report about the problem areas."}
