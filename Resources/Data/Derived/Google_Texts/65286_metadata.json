(Photo: File / The Tennessean)Buy Photo\n\nEnd Obamacare hatred, help Tennessee\n\nWhat is the difference between federal Republicans (Alexander and Corker) and state Republicans (Tracy and Gardenhire)?\n\nInsure Tennessee, which could have provided 300,000 Tennesseans, \u201cthe working poor,\u201d with insurance. Obviously, the state Republicans a) have insider information that the federal government\u2019s promise to fund 100 percent of a Medicaid expansion is no good, b) know that in 2016, when the federal government pays 90 percent and The Tennessee Hospital Association pays 10 percent, that those promissory notes are not good, and finally, c) believe that health care jobs created in community hospitals are not a part of the economic engine in our state.\n\nState Republicans against Insure Tennessee have to simply hate any affiliation to \u201cObamacare.\u201d\n\nCould we simply pretend that the program was once called \u201cRomneycare\u201d and see if the light bulb in their brains would go off in favor of Insure Tennessee?\n\nGreg Cantrell\n\nBrentwood 37027\n\nKill two birds with one stone\n\nI see that state legislators have killed Insure Tennessee and also have also OK\u2019d the guns-in-parks measure.\n\nPerhaps the two measures could be combined; herd all the uninsured people into parks, where they could be shot by gun owners.\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t have to be deliberate \u2014 an accidental stray bullet would be just as fatal. Dead is dead. This would help to \u201cdecrease the surplus population.\u201d (If any legislators are not literate enough to catch the quoted reference, perhaps someone who knows how to read could explain it.)\n\nThis state has called itself the Volunteer State. It needs a new slogan; I suggest \u201cthe Backward State.\u201d\n\nColeman Coates\n\nAntioch 37013\n\nWhy won\u2019t they be moved?\n\nTennessean photographer George Walker IV deserves an award for his stunning image under April 1\u2019s front-page headline, \u201cHOPE IS LOST AGAIN.\u201d\n\nMany of us are moved by visual images that grab the heartstrings and greatly help in telling the story.\n\nWe are moved when we see people who are unfairly denied medical help, who work and are underpaid, or who can\u2019t work and are unable to afford health coverage.\n\nAt this special time of year, we are moved when we see portrayals of Christ\u2019s crucifixion. Humbly, let\u2019s borrow the words of Jesus from the cross and say, \u201cFather, forgive them, for they (the state legislators) know not what they do.\u201d\n\nWhy do we keep electing these uncaring, excuse-making leaders? Let\u2019s unseat all those with \u201cR\u201d after their name who blocked Insure Tennessee legislation.\n\nMark Dorais\n\nNashville 37217\n\nWho says \u201cyou can\u2019t fix stupid\u201d?\n\nOur state legislators have failed yet one more time to do the right thing.\n\nThere are 280,000 Tennesseans who work hard to pay their rent/mortgage, feed and clothe their families, and pay for basic necessities, but they don\u2019t have enough money left over to buy health insurance. Insure Tennessee would have provided health insurance for this group at no cost to the taxpayers for three years, with an option to \u201copt out\u201d at any time.\n\nThis is what sensible people call a \u201cno-brainer.\u201d\n\nHere is how you \u201cfix stupid\u201d: You vote them out of office!\n\nHere are the six senators who voted to \u201ckill\u201d Insure Tennessee: Jack Johnson, Jim Tracy, Todd Gardenhire, Delores Gresham, Steve Southerland and Bo Watson (\u201cFor Insure Tennessee backers, hope is lost again,\u201d April 1). Please remember these names the next time you vote.\n\nN.D. Hasty, MD\n\nNashville 37215\n\nEndlessly inane legislative session\n\nLet me get this right.\n\nInsure Tennessee voted down in committee, fake guns are worth a bill, we need to designate the Bible as our \u201cstate\u201d book, guns are allowed in parks, but we can\u2019t afford to change the signage to warn park visitors that they are in danger.\n\nHow long, oh how long, is this legislative session going to last?\n\nEllen Finney\n\nKingsport 37664\n\nRead or Share this story: http://tnne.ws/1yjOFzl", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Readers sound off on Insure Tennessee.", "og": {"site_name": "The Tennessean", "description": "Readers sound off on Insure Tennessee.", "title": "Letters to the editor, April 12: Insure Tennessee", "url": "http://www.tennessean.com/story/opinion/readers/2015/04/11/letters-editor-insure-tennessee/25590991/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/tennessean.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Readers sound off on Insure Tennessee.", "title": "Letters to the editor, April 12: Insure Tennessee", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/35a106a2ea6ae3b1f2cf775c1c33f3bc581c36c3/c=0-40-800-840&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Nashville/2015/04/10/B9316926857Z.1_20150410155000_000_GTFAFIMFJ.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@tennessean", "site": "@tennessean", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600028886", "fb": {"app_id": 121487414583460}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Persons/Jim Tracy", "gci-categories": "Persons/Jim Tracy", "gci-asset-type": "data", "title": "Letters to the editor, April 12: Insure Tennessee", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "opinion/readers", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1ee374163b8d091cff89bfa41d3047d13ab4d364/c=70-0-730-880/local/-/media/Nashville/2015/04/10/B9316926857Z.1_20150410155000_000_GTFAFIMFJ.1-0.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/59cddb8796e1d9ff4ee40b41c3d02b7a867b9a87/c=0-40-800-840/local/-/media/Nashville/2015/04/10/B9316926857Z.1_20150410155000_000_GTFAFIMFJ.1-0.jpg", "contenttype": "data", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7035a18050018b450c358f92f733b2c836586b75/c=0-140-800-740/local/-/media/Nashville/2015/04/10/B9316926857Z.1_20150410155000_000_GTFAFIMFJ.1-0.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/90d7673ff299351c7f80ea9bc38ce91d9c9b4c1c/c=0-215-800-665&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/Nashville/2015/04/10/B9316926857Z.1_20150410155000_000_GTFAFIMFJ.1-0.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-04-10T23:11:41.910000-05:00", "shorthed": "Letters, April 12: Insure Tennessee", "articleid": 25590991, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d58edc4d6dafb9e71c1149df371563b4052b46ba/c=0-215-800-665/local/-/media/Nashville/2015/04/10/B9316926857Z.1_20150410155000_000_GTFAFIMFJ.1-0.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ac638b2f6fa08adcb3cb6ce08b42ddd9d842c8ea/c=152-0-647-880/local/-/media/Nashville/2015/04/10/B9316926857Z.1_20150410155000_000_GTFAFIMFJ.1-0.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": "insure tennessee, tennessee, health, healthcare, nashville"}, "article_summary": "Buy Photo Letters to the editor may be emailed to letters@tennessean.com, faxed to 615-259-8093 or mailed to Letters to the Editor, The Tennessean, 1100 Broadway, Nashville, TN 37203.\nHere are the six senators who voted to \u201ckill\u201d Insure Tennessee: Jack Johnson, Jim Tracy, Todd Gardenhire, Delores Gresham, Steve Southerland and Bo Watson (\u201cFor Insure Tennessee backers, hope is lost again,\u201d April 1).\nGreg CantrellBrentwood 37027Kill two birds with one stoneI see that state legislators have killed Insure Tennessee and also have also OK\u2019d the guns-in-parks measure.\nLet\u2019s unseat all those with \u201cR\u201d after their name who blocked Insure Tennessee legislation.\nOur state legislators have failed yet one more time to do the right thing."}
