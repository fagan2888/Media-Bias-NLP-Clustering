Health Plan Check-Up: Prepping for 2016

As the fiscal fourth quarter quickly approaches, HR and benefits managers should prepare for upcoming compliance requirements under the Affordable Care Act.

Applicable large employers-aka "ALEs", generally employers with at least 50 full-time employees-are required to report information to the IRS and full-time employees regarding an employer's offer of health insurance coverage, if any. Reporting is required for calendar year 2015 and each calendar year thereafter. ALEs can satisfy this requirement using IRS Form 1094-C and Forms 1095-C.

Each full-time employee will need to receive a Form 1095-C no later than February 1, 2016, which reflects information on the offer of coverage for the entire 2015 calendar year. By February 29, 2016 (or March 31, 2016 if filing electronically), the Form 1094-C and all Forms 1095-C should be transmitted to the IRS.

Employers with a self-insured health plan are responsible for an additional component in the reporting process-identifying individuals who have minimum essential coverage through the employer's self-insured group health plan. ALEs may use Form 1095-C Part III to satisfy this requirement. Employers with a self-insured health plan should be aware that a Form 1095-C is provided not only to every full-time employee but also to any covered employee (e.g., a part-time employee) or other individual (e.g., retiree, COBRA qualified beneficiary) who is the primary insured under the self-insured group health plan. Information regarding any family members with health coverage is also reflected on the individual's Form 1095-C.

If offering a self-insured health plan, non-ALEs (employers with fewer than 50 full-time employees) are responsible for this reporting and will use Form 1094-B and Forms 1095-B to satisfy this requirement. The same timelines described above apply.

This reporting is complicated and employers should act now to identify resources, including payroll vendors and third-party administrators, who can assist in the collection, completion and delivery of these forms to employees and the IRS.

Reinsurance Fee

The ACA has added a new fee on minimum value plans intended to shift the risk of covering expenses associated with large claimants under the Health Insurance Marketplace. This is called the Transitional Reinsurance Fee and it is in effect for three years, from 2014 through 2016. While the insurance carrier is responsible for paying this fee for insured group health plans, the plan sponsor (typically the employer) will need to report information and pay this fee to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for a self-insured group health plan. Enrollment counts and payment are made through www.pay.gov and additional supporting documentation is created through www.regtap.info.

For calendar year 2015, the payment is $44 per covered life (that's each belly button covered by the plan). Enrollment counts for 2015 must be submitted by November 16, 2015. Employers have the option to pay the fee in a lump sum ($44 per covered life) by January 15, 2016, or they may split the payment over two due dates ($33 per covered life due January 15, 2016 and $11 per covered life due November 15, 2016). The payment method is determined when enrollment counts are submitted. The submission form for 2015 should be available later this year.

For calendar year 2016, the fee is $27 per covered life. This is the final year this fee will be assessed at the federal level. Counts are due by November 15, 2016 with payment due in one lump sum by January 16, 2017 or a split payment with $21.60 per covered life due January 16, 2017 and the balance due November 15, 2017.

Out-of-Pocket Maximums

For calendar year 2016, non-grandfathered health plans must comply with limitations on cost-sharing. These limits are $6,850 for self-only coverage and $13,700 for family coverage. Notably, for 2016, the self-only limitation on cost sharing ($6,850) applies to each individual, even if the individual is enrolled in family coverage.

HSA-compatible high deductible health plans (HDHPs) have a lower cost sharing limit for 2016, $6,550 for self-only HDHP coverage and $13,100 for family HDHP coverage.

Small Group Insurance Changes

Beginning with plan years on or after January 1, 2016, the definition of a small group for purposes of non-grandfathered insured coverage will include employers with 100 or fewer employees. Previously, this market was defined to include employers up to 50 employees. Among other things, group health plans in the small group market need to comply with the following:

Â· Offer coverage for all of the essential health benefits;

Â· Satisfy a minimum actuarial value of coverage (at least a Bronze level plan (60 percent actuarial value)); and

Â· Follow community rating rules that limit rating variations to:

o The benefit level and tier of coverage (e.g., single vs. family)

o Geographic area;

o Age (not more than 3 to1 for adults) and

o Tobacco use (not more than 1.5 to 1).

Depending on the makeup of a particular small employer, these new requirements may result in rate increases (or in some cases decreases) as the demographics conform to these new limitations.

These requirements do not apply in the self-insured market.

HHS announced a transitional policy that allows employers in the small market (including employers with 51-100 employees) to continue non-conforming policies for one year, subject to State and insurance carrier approval. Not all States and carriers have adopted this policy, so employers should discuss with carriers to determine whether this is a viable option in their area and understand potential implications.

While it has been over five years since the ACA was enacted, implementation of the law continues to pose challenges for employers. Understanding the requirements and proactively taking steps to comply is an important part of strategic planning and development of any benefits programs. ACA implementation is not over yet. On the horizon is the effective date of the High Cost Plan Excise Tax in 2018. This will be buffered by the 2016 election cycle that invites opportunity for change and may bring along new and more complicated challenges.
