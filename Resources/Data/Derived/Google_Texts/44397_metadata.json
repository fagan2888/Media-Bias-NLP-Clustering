But for as serious as the heroin epidemic is, far more Mainers each year seek treatment for alcohol dependency.\n\nIn 2014, alcohol was the most common substance for which Mainers sought treatment, with 3,589 Mainers entering treatment, compared with 2,538 for heroin and morphine. The need for treatment, however, is much greater. An estimated one in seven Mainers needed but did not receive treatment for alcohol dependency, according to the Maine Office of Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services\u2019 2015 substance abuse trends report.\n\nThe state has a chronic shortage of treatment and detox facilities for Mainers addicted to alcohol, a shortage worsened by the closure of Mercy Hospital\u2019s Addiction Recovery Center in Westbrook last August.\n\n\u201cThe opiate epidemic has sucked all the oxygen out of the room,\u201d Dr. Mark Publicker, a nationally recognized addiction expert who practiced at the Westbrook center, said. \u201cWhen we talk about addiction treatment, there\u2019s never a mention about treatment for alcohol.\u201d\n\nNot enough beds\n\nWhen Mercy\u2019s Addiction Recovery Center was open, it served as a statewide resource for alcohol and drug detox. Hospitals as far north as Bangor routinely transferred patients who needed to withdraw from alcohol to Westbrook, Publicker said.\n\nOnly a handful of centers across the state provide inpatient detox services for Mainers who need to safely withdraw from alcohol, including MaineGeneral Medical Center in Augusta, St. Mary\u2019s Regional Medical Center in Lewiston and Milestone Foundation in Portland. North of Augusta, however, there are few detox services.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a real challenge our state is confronted with. It\u2019s not a rural problem; it\u2019s a statewide issue,\u201d Pete McCorison, program director for substance abuse services at Aroostook Mental Health Center, said.\n\nMost hospitals still will admit someone going through acute alcohol withdrawal, McCorison said, but few offer dedicated inpatient detox programs.\n\nThe growing rate of opioid addiction has left several detox facilities with fewer beds available to help Mainers safely withdraw from alcohol.\n\nUntil recently, Milestone\u2019s 16-bed detox program in Portland, the only nonhospital detox center in Maine, almost exclusively served patients withdrawing from alcohol. But a couple of years ago, the program began to see a spike in admissions for opioids, which now account for nearly half of all admissions, according to Milestone Executive Director Robert Fowler.\n\n\u201cSo the impact of that is that it\u2019s becoming more and more difficult for people with alcohol addiction to find treatment beds at any level of care,\u201d Fowler said. \u201cEvery day we have people we are unable to accommodate because of program capacity.\u201d\n\nAlcohol withdrawal, unlike withdrawal from opioids, can be fatal. In regular and chronic drinkers, the body ramps up production of hormones to offset the depressive effects of alcohol. When someone abruptly stops drinking, the body continues to pump out these hormones.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s something that distinguishes it from a heroin withdrawal. In heroin withdrawal, people feel as though they\u2019ll die, they feel horrible and they feel as though they won\u2019t be able to survive the process, but it\u2019s not fatal in the way that withdrawal from alcohol can be,\u201d Fowler said.\n\nEvery year about 226,000 patients are treated in a hospital for a condition related to alcohol withdrawal, according to a 2004 study in the journal American Family Physician. Only 10 percent of patients with alcohol dependence are treated as inpatients, so it\u2019s possible that as many as 2 million Americans go through alcohol withdrawal.\n\nMost drinkers will experience mild symptoms and can safely wean off alcohol outside a medical setting. Minor symptoms, which begin within six to 12 hours, include anxiety, insomnia and tremors. Within 12 to 24 hours, some patients may begin to experience hallucinations.\n\nBut people with a history of heavy alcohol use, those who have undergone multiple detoxes and older drinkers are at risk for more serious complications. Within 24 to 48 hours after their last drink, chronic alcohol users can have seizures that without supervision can result in falls and death.\n\nIn the most severe cases, people can experience a condition called \u201c delirium tremens\u201d that is fatal in about 1 to 5 percent of cases. Delirium tremens, which can set in 48 hours after the last drink, is characterized by confusion, fever and seizures. Unattended, it can cause dehydration, hyperthermia and irregular heartbeat, all of which can be fatal.\n\n\u201cAs a medical emergency, alcohol withdrawal is more serious,\u201d Fowler said.\n\nTreatment that works\n\nIf someone in Maine needs treatment for alcohol dependency, odds are low they will be told there is an effective medication that can curb cravings for alcohol. A shortage of doctors who prescribe anti-craving medications is arguably one of the biggest challenges to providing treatment for alcohol dependency in Maine.\n\nWhen he headed the Mercy\u2019s Addiction Recovery Center, Publicker and his staff regularly incorporated anti-craving medications, such as naltrexone or its injectable form, Vivitrol, to help patients sustain their recovery as they progressed through the center\u2019s outpatient treatment program.\n\n\u201cTime after time, we\u2019d be sitting in the recovery center with patients in detox as demoralized as can be who had never been prescribed an anti-craving medication and who always expressed shock that no one told them these medications existed,\u201d Publicker said.\n\nEven after a patient was started on an anti-craving medication, few primary care physicians would be willing to continue providing it to patients after they completed the program, Publicker said.\n\nOne reason that access to this medication is low is the prevailing bias against viewing alcohol dependency as a chronic disease that needs to be managed with medication. Another reason is that few physicians and few patients know about the effectiveness of naltrexone, even though the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 1994 approved its use for treating alcohol dependency.\n\nOnly 10 percent of patients nationally seeking treatment for alcohol dependency are prescribed available anti-craving medications, according to a 2014 study in the Journal of the American Medical Association.\n\nInstead, most patients are referred to group-based substance abuse counseling or 12-step support groups. These programs may work for some, but they largely ignore the underlying chronic nature of alcohol dependency that makes relapses common.\n\nAlcohol dependency is a chronic disease, not a behavioral disorder. Overtime, chronic alcohol use leads to changes in the brain\u2019s chemistry that lead to severe compulsion, which makes it hard to resist the urge for another beer. And this is where medication steps in.\n\nWhen someone takes naltrexone, for instance, it blocks the alcoholic high and reduces the impulse to continue to drink. Naltrexone, unlike methadone, has no risk for addiction because it doesn\u2019t cause a high.\n\nA growing body of research suggests that naltrexone coupled with substance use counseling helps reduce alcohol cravings and relapses into dependency, allowing patients to focus on therapy and goals to sustain their recovery, according to the study in the Journal of the American Medical Association. A patient\u2019s odds of avoiding relapse are almost doubled with the use of anti-craving medication than with counseling or 12-step programs alone.\n\n\u201cMedications exist and believe me they work,\u201d Publicker said. \u201cThey take people who have been demoralized by relapse after relapse after relapse and restore to them the ability to build their recovery.\u201d\n\nCoverage gap\n\nAnother challenge to addressing alcohol dependency is that many Mainers can\u2019t afford treatment because they don\u2019t have health insurance. Even as the Affordable Care Act expanded options for insurance, the number of Mainers without health insurance has held steady at 15 percent, according to a 2015 report by the Maine Health Access Foundation.\n\nCuts to MaineCare eligibility left thousands of Mainers without health insurance, many of whom suffer from an alcohol or drug dependencies. Substance abuse programs have fought to remain open in the wake these cuts, and the state\u2019s decision against accepting federal funds to expand MaineCare coverage.\n\nMercy\u2019s Addiction Recovery Center struggled under an uptick in charity care for addiction treatment following MaineCare cuts to the point where the model became unsustainable, Publicker said.\n\n\u201cSometimes 20, 30 or 40 percent of patients in our inpatient program were uninsured,\u201d he said.\n\nBack at Milestone in Portland, Fowler said that more than half the people who enter into the detox program have neither private health insurance nor MaineCare. A state block grant, however, helps cover the cost of providing uncompensated care for the uninsured.\n\nBut the real problem for those patients is that their options for outpatient care and counseling after detox are limited because there are few free care programs for people without health insurance.\n\n\u201cIt very much impacts what their aftercare plan might look like and their access to treatment options,\u201d Fowler said.\n\nMilestone offers a high-intensity residential treatment program in Old Orchard Beach for people who have struggled to stay in recovery. But only one of the 16 beds available in the program is available to patients without MaineCare. The waitlist for that one bed is years long, Fowler said, even though the program almost always has empty MaineCare beds.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s really unfortunate because people are seeking treatment out of state or people are going without treatment,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.1.5", "og": {"site_name": "The Bangor Daily News", "description": "Heroin has become a major problem in Maine.
