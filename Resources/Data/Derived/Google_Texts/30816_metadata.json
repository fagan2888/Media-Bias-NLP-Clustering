The ruling was the first of its kind in a navigator case and calls into question the constitutionality of similar laws elsewhere, said Jay Angoff, an attorney with Washington-based Mehri & Skalet PLLC, which represented the Missouri groups.\n\n\u201cMissouri\u2019s attempts to obstruct the Affordable Care Act with unnecessary and burdensome navigator requirements are simply preempted by federal law,\u201d wrote Jane Perkins, an attorney for nonprofit groups that sued the state, in a statement. \u201cOn this the court is clear: federally funded navigators must be able to exercise the duties they are funded to do under federal law.\u201d\n\nRepublicans have said the measures are aimed at protecting consumers, given the personal information they must handle in this role. Obamacare supporters have said the measures are designed to undermine efforts to sign up the uninsured.\n\n$67 Million\n\nThe Obama administration awarded $67 million in grants last year to 105 hospitals, social-service agencies, local clinics and other groups meant to help steer people through the complexities of the new insurance system, with its deductibles, copays, provider networks and tax credits.\n\n\u201cHaving made the choice to leave the operation of the exchange to the federal government, Missouri cannot choose to impose additional requirements or limitations on the exchange,\u201d Smith wrote yesterday in granting a preliminary injunction suspending enforcement of the law by the Missouri Department of Insurance, Financial Institutions and Professional Registration.\n\nThe state is reviewing the decision, Nanci Gonder, a press secretary to Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster, a Democrat, said in an e-mailed statement.\n\nThe case is St. Louis Effort for AIDS v. Huff, 13-cv-4246, U.S. District Court, Western District of Missouri (Jefferson City).", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Alex Nussbaum and Andrew Zajac", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-01-23/missouri-law-restricting-obamacare-guides-blocked-by-judge-1-", "title": "Law Restricting Obamacare Navigators Blocked by Missouri Judge", "description": "A Missouri law requiring licenses for counselors who help consumers find health insurance on the Obamacare exchanges was temporarily blocked by a U.S. judge, setting back a measure by a state hostile to the federal health-care overhaul statute.", "card": "summary", "site": "@business"}, "parsely-author": "Alex Nussbaum and Andrew Zajac", "parsely-type": "post", "keywords": "Law,Missouri", "news_keywords": "Law,Missouri", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-01-23/missouri-law-restricting-obamacare-guides-blocked-by-judge-1-", "parsely-title": "Law Restricting Obamacare Navigators Blocked by Missouri Judge", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff0000", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "parsely-pub-date": "2014-01-24T14:16:33.166Z", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "A Missouri law requiring licenses for counselors who help consumers find health insurance on the Obamacare exchanges was temporarily blocked by a U.S. judge, setting back a measure by a state hostile to the federal health-care overhaul statute.", "parsely-tags": "Law,Missouri,Region: Global,Page: article", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.bwbx.io/business/public/images/favicons/mstile-144x144-bbd2101292.png", "date": "2014-01-24T14:16:33.166Z", "parsely-section": "science-energy", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "og": {"url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-01-23/missouri-law-restricting-obamacare-guides-blocked-by-judge-1-", "type": "website", "site_name": "Bloomberg.com", "description": "A Missouri law requiring licenses for counselors who help consumers find health insurance on the Obamacare exchanges was temporarily blocked by a U.S. judge, setting back a measure by a state hostile to the federal health-care overhaul statute.", "title": "Law Restricting Obamacare Navigators Blocked by Missouri Judge"}, "fb": {"status": "A Missouri law requiring licenses for counselors who help consumers find health insurance on the Obamacare exchanges was temporarily blocked by a U.S. judge, setting back a measure by a state hostile to the federal health-care overhaul statute."}, "parsely-post-id": "MZVKBM6JTSEB01", "format-detection": "telephone=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda209\"", "article_summary": "The case is St. Louis Effort for AIDS v.
