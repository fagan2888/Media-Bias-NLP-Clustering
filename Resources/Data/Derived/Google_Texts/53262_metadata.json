Rural areas also have a disproportionately high number of lower-income, Medi-Cal-eligible residents which creates a challenging situation for state health officials charged with providing medical coverage in rural settings.\n\nOn Nov. 1, the state launched an ambitious plan to transition Medi-Cal beneficiaries in rural areas from fee-for-service care arrangements to managed care plans. The move shifts 28 rural counties to the financial model the state is using throughout the rest of the state.\n\nAlso on Nov. 1, the state launched the last phase of its Healthy Families transition \u2014 moving children in rural counties to Medi-Cal managed care. Healthy Families is California\u2019s Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program.\n\nThere have been scattered, anecdotal reports that parents can\u2019t find available physicians for their children because some doctors who had participated in Healthy Families won\u2019t be making the switch to the Medi-Cal managed care model, which pays lower rates.\n\nHalf the State\u2019s Children Eligible for Medi-Cal\n\nThe concern for Kelly Hardy has always been the children. As director of health policy for Children Now, Hardy has kept a careful eye on the transition of 860,000 children from Healthy Families to Medi-Cal managed care.\n\n\u201cI do think [state health officials] deserve some credit. The rollout has gone relatively smoothly,\u201d Hardy said. \u201cBut the access to providers, especially in rural and underserved areas, that\u2019s a real question still.\u201d\n\nChildren are the proverbial canary in the coal mine of rural counties\u2019 shift to Medi-Cal managed care, she said. Healthy Families offered providers higher reimbursement rates than Medi-Cal, and physicians now stand to lose significant money by caring for Medi-Cal children.\n\nAnd there are a lot of them.\n\nState health officials estimate roughly 4.5 million children are in Medi-Cal. About half of the births in California are covered through Medi-Cal.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re at a new point where about half of the kids in the state are Medi-Cal kids. It speaks to the stakes we\u2019re talking about, that we better get this right,\u201d Hardy said.\n\nThe potential for problems is greater in rural areas with a higher percentage of lower-income Californians, she said.\n\n\u201cI am just amazed by the numbers we\u2019re talking about,\u201d Hardy said. \u201cThat speaks to the dedication of the providers, that all of those children get care, and it speaks to the level of outreach by the Department of Health Care Services, as well,\u201d to make sure kids can get care.\n\n\u201cBut really, at the root, they just need to pay more for the care,\u201d Hardy said.\n\nAccess Issues in Some Rural Counties?\n\nHardy and other children\u2019s advocates say it\u2019s too early to provide big-picture statistics, but they\u2019ve heard reports of provider network inadequacy in Lassen, Placer and Imperial counties so far.\n\n\u201cIn some counties, especially those served by Partnership HealthPlan, things seem to be going well,\u201d said Suzie Shupe, executive director of California Coverage and Health Initiatives, a not-for-profit children\u2019s advocacy group. Partnership HealthPlan, based in Fairfield, is one of half a dozen not-for-profit, public-private, county-organized health systems in the state. It serves 14 counties in Northern California.\n\nIn other parts of the state, there have been reports of access issues, Shupe said.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line is that it isn\u2019t possible to know the extent to which families have encountered problems because the information available to families about how to get help and how to report such problems has been so thin,\u201d Shupe said.\n\n\u201cI think what we\u2019re seeing now is a lack of providers,\u201d Hardy said. \u201cIt looks like few or no providers switched from Healthy Families over to Medi-Cal managed care. That\u2019s what we\u2019re hearing, rather than confusion.\n\nPeople are saying there\u2019s a non-existent network here.\u201d\n\nThat is news to Jane Ogle, deputy director at DHCS. \u201cWe haven\u2019t heard of any problems in Placer or Lassen [counties] at all.\u201d\n\nDHCS officials are monitoring rural counties especially carefully right now, looking for complaints or trouble, and they haven\u2019t received many negative reports, Ogle said.\n\nThere was concern in Imperial County, Ogle said, where one plan\u2019s provider network wasn\u2019t up in time for the transition rollout.\n\n\u201cIn Imperial County we only had one plan, so Molina (Healthcare) agreed to be another provider for us,\u201d Ogle said. \u201cSo for them it was a tight timeline to line up that provider network.\u201d\n\nOnce the provider network contracts were signed, Molina bought full-page advertisements in the local newspaper to alert residents, Ogle said.\n\n\u201cFrom our point of view, it has gone very well,\u201d Ogle said.\n\nTwo Transition Efforts Are Linked\n\nOgle said both transitions \u2014 the rural expansion into Medi-Cal managed care and the shift of Healthy Families children \u2014 had to be done at the same time and be completed before January, when the Affordable Care Act will be fully implemented and the state\u2019s expands Medi-Cal eligibility.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to transition Healthy Families in the counties that have never had any managed care, and we wanted to open up managed care in rural counties at the same time,\u201d Ogle said. \u201cTo allow for that expansion, we wanted to do it at the same time. If we only moved the relatively small population of Healthy Families children in rural areas, we would not have had the numbers to do it.\u201d\n\nWhen you add in the rural expansion of the adult population, she said, \u201cthen there are sufficient numbers to do it.\u201d\n\nUnder managed care, Californians should have access to more services, Ogle said. \u201cMaking sure they get \u2026 immunizations done, \u2026 and having access standards, that kind of thing,\u201d she said, \u201cnone of which is in fee-for-service.\u201d\n\nGiven the size and scope of the Healthy Families transition this year, the overall smoothness and success so far has been remarkable, Ogle said.\n\n\u201cWe know there will always be individual and anecdotal issues,\u201d Ogle said. \u201cBut we transitioned 900,000 children, and by and large it\u2019s been a good, smooth transition for them, and they\u2019re now well-placed for the [ACA and Medi-Cal] expansion to occur.\u201d\n\nHardy agreed that the rollout has gone well, and she gives DHCS officials a lot of praise for that. The children in rural areas, though, may encounter problems in the months ahead, she said. Because children use medical services less often than adults, the effect on access might not be immediately clear, she added.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t seen a big smoking gun, and we\u2019re really thankful we haven\u2019t seen a big smoking gun,\u201d Hardy said, \u201cbut we\u2019re still concerned about sneaky issues like continuity of care and network adequacy.\u201d\n\nIn Lassen County, for instance, there\u2019s only one federally qualified health center in the entire county, she said, so the wiggle room for network inadequacy is razor-thin.\n\nIf a high percentage of children in the transition is able to maintain access to their preferred primary care physician, that\u2019s great, she said. However, that still leaves a group of children who did not get to remain with their physician.\n\n\u201cAccess to care is still a huge concern,\u201d Hardy said. \u201cSo if you think this is a great result for California\u2019s kids, your standards are way too low.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "This month, the state simultaneously is introducing Medi-Cal managed care to rural counties and launching the final transition phase for Healthy Families children.
