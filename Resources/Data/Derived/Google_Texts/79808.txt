The city manager of Pratt faces domestic battery charges following his arrest Friday evening.

David Howard, 58, was arrested on two counts of domestic battery and has since been released on a $1,000 bond.

Sheriff Vernon Chinn said officers were called around 8 p.m. to the report of an intoxicated man trying to harm family members at a rural home southeast of Pratt. When officers arrived, they found Howard and two women in the home.

Throughout the day word of the allegations against one of Pratt's top leaders has spread throughout the small community.

"Surprised and I hope everything goes well for him," said Pratt resident Richard Bell.

Bell knows Howard and says he's well respected.

"Very gentle, very kind person, very interested in the public and making sure everything is done right," he said.

According to the Pratt Tribune, the Pratt City Commission last year extended a 13.5-year relationship with Howard with a five-year contract that expires in August of 2020.

The town's mayor and commissioners tell KAKE News they have no comment on the alleged incident.

Commissioners say they are investigating into what happened and plan to release a statement on Monday.

A KAKE News crew stopped by Howard's home to ask him questions. We were told he was not there at the time.
