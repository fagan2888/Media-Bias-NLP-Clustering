Owens, a physician who holds an advanced degree in public health, talks with Kathleen Sebelius, Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nBy Hannah Poturalski\n\nStaff Writer\n\nTwo weeks after the launch of new health insurance marketplaces under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, many Americans still can\u2019t access the federally-run website, where Ohio\u2019s marketplace lives.\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius acknowledged that the launch of the website \u2014 HealthCare.gov \u2014 was \u201crockier than we would have liked\u201d during a panel discussion Wednesday at Cincinnati State Technical and Community College.\n\nBut \u201cno one is missing health coverage\u201d because of technical glitches that have plagued the website since it opened for enrollment on Oct. 1, Sebelius said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still in the first quarter,\u201d she told a crowd of about 80, including Cincinnati State students and faculty. \u201cThere are vast improvements in the system, and we are still not satisfied. We want to make this a seamless, easy to use product.\u201d\n\nFor 49 million uninsured Americans \u2014 nearly 1.5 million in Ohio \u2014 the marketplaces are the first opportunity to compare insurance plans side-by-side and check eligibility for federal tax subsidies to make it more affordable, Sebelius said.\n\nShe was joined on the panel by Cincinnati Health Commissioner Dr. Noble Maseru; Keith Deaton, an uninsured real estate agent; Kyle Vath, clinical coordinator at Crossroad Health Center in Cincinnati; and moderator O\u2019dell M. Owens, president of Cincinnati State and a physician.\n\nThe health insurance marketplaces will be open for enrollment through the end of March 31, with coverage beginning Jan. 1 for those who enroll by Dec. 15. Sebelius would not disclose current enrollment figures.\n\nDeaton, of Mt Healthy, who works at the Fairfield office of Sibcy Cline, said as a real estate agent his income began suffering when the economy crashed in 2008. He could no longer afford the monthly insurance premiums of $1,400 for his family, and has now been without health coverage since Nov. 1, 2012.\n\n\u201cI was without health care at all,\u201d Deaton said, who then started visiting the Cincinnati Health Department for services.\n\nDeaton said he\u2019s tried three times to access the insurance exchanges online, but has yet to be able to enter the site and comparison shop. Deaton said he\u2019s excited about the opportunity to access the exchanges because he and his wife have several pre-existing conditions.\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019d taken care of myself in my youth I wouldn\u2019t have the conditions I have now,\u201d Deaton said. \u201cThe youth of America need to grasp this.\u201d\n\nDavid Kern, chairman of the Butler County Republican Party, said he agrees that changes to the health care system are needed, but believes a federally-funded program is too costly.\n\n\u201cSure they want young people because they will pay higher rates which they don\u2019t need,\u201d Kern said. \u201cThey don\u2019t have all the health needs.\u201d\n\nSebelius said under the Affordable Care Act, about 100,000 young adults have been able to extend health coverage under their parents\u2019 plans until age 26. As well, more than five million Americans with pre-existing conditions cannot be denied or underwritten.\n\n\u201cThe message is no one knows when you\u2019re going to trip on the basketball court or some car is going to run into you\u2026 and we know hospital bills and emergency room bills can be extraordinarily expensive,\u201d Sebelius said. \u201cWithout insurance you have very little opportunity to deal with it.\u201d\n\nHealth centers across the U.S. have also been adding certified application counselors in order to help with enrollment efforts and share resources with the community.\n\n\u201cOutreach, education and information, that\u2019s the quest right now for us,\u201d Maseru said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Two weeks after the launch of new health insurance marketplaces under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, many Americans still can\u2019t access the federally-run website, where Ohio\u2019s marketplace lives.", "og": {"url": "http://www.daytondailynews.com/news/news/health-secretary-leads-local-discussion-on-afforda/nbQFC/", "image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/img/photos/2013/10/16/30/1c/101713-sebelius-visit3.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Two weeks after the launch of new health insurance marketplaces under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, many Americans still can\u2019t access the federally-run website, where Ohio\u2019s marketplace lives.", "title": "Health Secretary leads local discussion on Affordable Care Act"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/resize/120x120/img/photos/2013/10/16/9f/55/101713-sebelius-visit1.jpg", "title": "Health Secretary leads local discussion on Affordable Care Act", "site": "@daytondailynews", "card": "summary", "description": "Two weeks after the launch of new health insurance marketplaces under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, many Americans still can&rsquo;t access the federally-run website, where Ohio&rsquo;s marketplace lives."}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "ddn", "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.daytondailynews.com/news/news/health-secretary-leads-local-discussion-on-afforda/nbQFC/"}, "cmg_revpath": "/re/292/2103110/news/news/health-secretary-leads-local-discussion-on-afforda/nbQFC/", "keywords": "warren county,OPhomepage,MJhomepage,HJNhomepage,DDNhomepage,Butler County", "google-site-verification": "fR8PW_DfizdYW0uymF5VkAzfbNKqKxqfnhqsbXSP7oI", "news_keywords": "warren county,OPhomepage,MJhomepage,HJNhomepage,DDNhomepage,Butler County"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc6ec\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI was without health care at all,\u201d Deaton said, who then started visiting the Cincinnati Health Department for services.\nKathleen Sebelius, Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, during Wednesday\u2019s panel discussion on the Affordable Care Act at Cincinnati State in Clifton.\n\u201cThey don\u2019t have all the health needs.\u201dSebelius said under the Affordable Care Act, about 100,000 young adults have been able to extend health coverage under their parents\u2019 plans until age 26.\n\u201cWe\u2019re still in the first quarter,\u201d she told a crowd of about 80, including Cincinnati State students and faculty.\nBy Hannah PoturalskiStaff WriterTwo weeks after the launch of new health insurance marketplaces under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, many Americans still can\u2019t access the federally-run website, where Ohio\u2019s marketplace lives."}
