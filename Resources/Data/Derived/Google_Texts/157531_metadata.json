Seven people were prosecuted under the state\u2019s Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, commonly called RICO, which allows prosecutors to bundle actions together and point to them as proof of a criminal racket. The charges carry stiffer penalties than street-level crimes.\n\nAfter Jacksonville police conducted a startling news conference last month tying at least three recent killings to gang rivalries, Mantei began talking with reporters for the first time about the makeup of the gangs, the threats they pose citywide and his drive to continue taking the fight to the enemy.\n\nNoting that crime boss Al Capone was eventually imprisoned on tax-evasion charges, Mantei said he and his fellow prosecutors and police are doing what it takes within the law to bust up the growing number of local gangs.\n\n\u201cIf I can put [away] a gangster who I know has been responsible for several shootings, but the only case I can make on him is one of ID fraud or whatever, we need to make that case,\u201d said Mantei, a prosecutor since 2000. \u201cWe need to make it stick.\u201d\n\nJacksonville police, who not too long ago were hesitant to admit publicly that gangs were in the city, recently said they have documented 47 gangs around town with as many as 1,200 members. A chunk are based in northwest neighborhoods, though they also haunt Arlington, the Westside, the Eastside and all points in between.\n\nRecent gang attacks have occurred at a busy Westside intersection, where two people were shot, and the killing of a man parked in a McDonald\u2019s off Cassat Avenue near Interstate 10. Mantei said people who don\u2019t think such violence \u2014 or crimes like burglaries used by gangs to finance themselves \u2014 could be creeping around the next corner are mistaken.\n\n\u201cJust because you\u2019re living in Riverside or wherever doesn\u2019t mean that this isn\u2019t going to have a direct effect on you,\u201d Mantei said.\n\nGENERATIONS, GUNS AND GLORY\n\nToday\u2019s local gangs include the children and other family members of yesterday\u2019s gang leaders, many of whom are dead, in prison or simply gave up the lifestyle. Other members take up the mantle left by those from the same neighborhoods.\n\n\u201cMost of them [the gangs] go through periods of activity and dormancy,\u201d Mantei said. \u201cThey\u2019re not the same people necessarily, but oftentimes there are interrelationships and generational ties.\u201d\n\nThe members are becoming younger and better armed. Assault rifles are being whipped out and bullets sprayed with no regard for what they hit or the terror left behind for innocent residents.\n\nMany guns are bought at gun shops or shows by people able to make the purchases who then sell them to felons. The guns are also stolen in burglaries, including targeted break-ins of police officers\u2019 cars and homes, Mantei said.\n\n\u201cThere certainly is no shortage of artillery,\u201d he said of the firepower.\n\nMany gangs are involved in taking pictures and filming videos posted on social media under the guise of being real entertainment. Hip-hop and rap music plays while members flash guns. Children are often used as props. Some gangs even have designated promoters.\n\nMantei said they call themselves entertainment groups for various motives, including an attempt to avoid being prosecuted as a criminal enterprise. One local gang even notes on its Facebook page that it\u2019s not a gang at all.\n\nTwo members from separate gangs who met with a Times-Union reporter insisted the videos and pictures are meant to attract national music producers who could make them famous and help them escape poverty. But those gang members declined several requests for more in-depth, sit down interviews intended explore all aspects of their groups, including their criminal histories.\n\nThe likelihood of any of them becoming entertainment stars is as far-fetched as the countless youths who believe they will be professional athletes one day. The truth, Mantei said, is that the images are used by gangs to taunt each other, recruit new members and simply show off.\n\n\u201cThirty-five percent of them are pointing guns at the camera and the remaining two-thirds are flipping the bird,\u201d Mantei said. \u201cThat\u2019s not entertainment. They don\u2019t divorce reality from fantasy.\u201d\n\nThe gangs continue to use drug selling and related crimes \u2014 burglaries, robberies, thefts \u2014 as fund-raising sources. But they have also turned to more white-collar crimes \u2014 income tax fraud and selling and buying EBT cards \u2014 as a way to supplement the more traditional sources of money, Mantei said.\n\nBEEFS, BRAWLS AND BULLETS\n\nUnresolved disputes started by some former and current gang members years ago are still being settled in 2015, with one-time victims becoming shooters, Mantei said.\n\n\u201cPeople are still carrying some of those old grudges,\u201d he said.\n\nNewer disputes, ranging from turf wars to disrespecting a fellow gang member, fuel what are already bitter rivalries. Those turf wars includes fights over swaths of neighborhoods, where protecting drug corners is key to financing the gangs.\n\nOne such rivalry involves gangs from the Eastside and Grand Park whose attacks on each other include a number of recent unsolved slayings and shootings.\n\nMany gang members come from broken homes in poor neighborhoods. But Mantei said in his many discussions with arrested gang members, he\u2019s found a number from stable, supportive families.\n\n\u201cThey have everything they need,\u201d Mantei said, \u201cand they chose to affiliate with some of these individuals. It\u2019s that affiliation that gets them into trouble.\u201d\n\nHe also said people join the gangs for reasons as old as becoming a Jet or a Shark decades ago.\n\n\u201cTo some of them, it\u2019s simply an identity, a belonging,\u201d Mantei said. \u201cIt\u2019s like, OK, I didn\u2019t make the football team or the basketball team, but here\u2019s my team.\u201d\n\nThe hierarchy includes \u201cshot callers,\u201d who control finances and drug supplies, and grunts, whose jobs are to take orders to steal cars to kill rivals as a way to gain respect and status.\n\n\u201cYou tend to be more of a decision-maker,\u201d he said of the shot callers.\n\n\u2018MURDER IS MURDER\u2019\n\nMost neighborhoods affected by gangs are filled with people who want to live in peace, Mantei said.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of people who live in these neighborhoods who take no part in this activity, want no part of this activity,\u201d he said.\n\nThey are essentially held hostage, he said.\n\nAnd while he encourages the public to help police by providing information about gang members, he said he understands the fear of retaliation by exposed gangs.\n\n\u201cPeople are so scared that the next round of bullets is going to find its way through their living-room window, they don\u2019t want to talk and would rather pretend it didn\u2019t happen or pretend it won\u2019t effect them,\u201d he said. \u201cMeanwhile, the problem feeds on itself.\u201d\n\nMantei said he is working on two or three new racketeering investigations but declined to discuss specifics. He said he remains determined to prosecute any gang members, no matter who is victimized, to help stop the violence.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to go as hard after a guy who kills a rival gang member as someone who kills an innocent bystander,\u201d he said. \u201cMurder is murder.\u201d\n\nJim Schoettler: (904) 359-4385\n\nIT\u2019S THE LAW:\n\nA criminal gang under Florida law is described as a formal or informal ongoing organization, association, or group that has as one of its primary activities the commission of criminal or delinquent acts, and that consists of three or more persons who have a common name or common identifying signs, colors, or symbols, including, but not limited to, terrorist organizations and hate groups.\n\nA criminal gang member under Florida law is a person who:\n\n\u25a0 Admits to gang membership.\n\n\u25a0 Is identified as a gang member by a parent/guardian.\n\n\u25a0 Is identified as a gang member by a documented reliable informant.\n\n\u25a0 Adopts the style of dress of a gang.\n\n\u25a0 Flashes a hand sign identified as used by a gang.\n\n\u25a0 Has a gang tattoo.\n\n\u25a0 Associates with one or more known gang members.\n\n\u25a0 Is identified as a gang member by an informant of previously untested reliability who is corroborated by independent information.\n\n\u25a0 Is identified as a gang member by physical evidence.\n\n\u25a0 Has been observed in the company of one or more known criminal gang members four or more times.
