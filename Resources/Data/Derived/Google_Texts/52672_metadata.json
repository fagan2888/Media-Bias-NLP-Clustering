This has become the daily staple for Christian communities throughout the Middle East.\u201d\n\nThe Prime Minister continued to extol the virtues of life for Christians living in Israel.\n\n\u201cHere in Israel religious freedom is a sacred principle. Israel\u2019s Christian citizens enjoy the full blessings of freedom and democracy; their equal rights are enshrined in Israeli law.\u201d\n\nAnd even Christian leaders agree with Netanyahu\u2019s sentiments; in a recent address to the United Nations, Israeli Greek Orthodox priest Gabriel Nadaf described Israel as the only country in the entire region where Christians can live safely.\n\nIn concluding his address, Prime Minister Netanyahu called for Jews and Christians to unite against the common threats they face.\n\n\u201cOn this most important day in the Christian calendar, let us remember the common heritage and values that unite us in the face of extremism and hatred \u2013 which we will never accept. From Jerusalem, the eternal capital of the Jewish people, the city of peace, I join Christians everywhere \u2013 and especially those in the Middle East \u2013 in a common prayer for a more peaceful and tolerant world. Merry Christmas, and a happy new year.\u201d\n\nIt is perhaps ironic that after centuries of Jews being persecuted by Christians, the only country in the Middle East in which Christians can feel safe is The Jewish State.\n\nGod does indeed move in mysterious ways\u2026\u2026", "article_metadata": {"description": "As the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, continues to conquer huge swathes of land in Syria and Iraq, threatening also to overrun other countries in the Middle", "og": {"site_name": "The Inquisitr News", "description": "As the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, continues to conquer huge swathes of land in Syria and Iraq, threatening also to overrun other countries in the Middle", "title": "Israel: The Only Safe Place For Christians In The Middle East?", "url": "http://www.inquisitr.com/1707709/israel-the-only-safe-place-for-christians-in-the-middle-east/", "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Israel-christians-e1419701071935-669x409.jpg", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-27T12:24:50+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-27T13:15:16+00:00"}, "type": "article"}, "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Israel-christians-e1419701071935-669x409.jpg", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "datePublished": "2014-12-27T12:24:50+00:00", "fb": {"app_id": 164157850314499, "pages": 71179904752}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/0cec37/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "keywords": "benjamin netanyahu,chistianity,christion persecution,isis,islamic state,israeli prime minister,religion", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Israel-christians-e1419701071935-669x409.jpg", "height": 409, "width": 669}, "site": "@theinquisitr", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "As the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, continues to conquer huge swathes of land in Syria and Iraq, threatening also to overrun other countries in the Middle"}, "viewport": "width=980"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc2db\"", "article_summary": "Merry Christmas, and a happy new year.\u201dIt is perhaps ironic that after centuries of Jews being persecuted by Christians, the only country in the Middle East in which Christians can feel safe is The Jewish State.\n\u201cChristian communities across the Middle East are experiencing a particularly difficult time, They\u2019re experiencing violence, execution and fear.\nAs the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, continues to conquer huge swathes of land in Syria and Iraq, threatening also to overrun other countries in the Middle East, Christians in the region find themselves in a difficult and traumatic situation.\nIn concluding his address, Prime Minister Netanyahu called for Jews and Christians to unite against the common threats they face.\nIronically, it seems that Israel, the only real democracy in the Middle East, is the safest haven for Christians, who are allowed to practice their faith, undisturbed and unquestioned in the Jewish State."}
