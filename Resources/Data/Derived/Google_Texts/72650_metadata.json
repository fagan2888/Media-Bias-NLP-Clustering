Released six years to the day that Drake debuted his super successful \u201cSo Far Gone\u201d mixtape, the Toronto native\u2019s latest set finds him in a serious space, not asking for respect, but demanding it.\n\nIf the mixtape\u2019s previously released track, \u201c6 God,\u201d wasn\u2019t warning enough, Drake is more confrontational these days. \u201cPlease don\u2019t speak to me like I\u2019m that Drake from four years ago, I\u2019m at a higher place, thinkin\u2019 they lions and tigers and bears, I go huntin\u2019, put heads on my fireplace,\u201d he raps on \u201cEnergy.\u201d\n\nAs usual, he\u2019s bragging about his crown (see: opening track \u201cLegend\u201d) but brooding over its weight (\u201cNo Tellin\u201d\u2019). Compared to previous projects, though, \u201cIf You\u2019re Reading This\u201d is darker and grittier, with a mix of lyrics and tone, that Drake, his longtime collaborator Noah \u201c40\u201d Shebib and crew have no doubt fashioned to match the brutal cold of Toronto, or \u201cthe 6,\u201d as they call it. (The name nods to the city\u2019s 416 and 647 area codes).\n\nThe set is as much about the rapper\u2019s hometown as it is about his hometown crew, whose Canadian and Jamaican accents distinguish the music and whose names are strewn throughout standout track \u201cKnow Yourself.\u201d\n\nOn another gem, \u201cYou & the 6,\u201d Drake credits Toronto and his mother for raising him. But the message is far from saccharine. \u201cI got no friends in this, mama,\u201d Drake raps about the business. \u201cI don\u2019t pretend with this, mama. I don\u2019t joke with this, mama. I pull the knife out my back and cut they throat with it, mama.\u201d\n\nOn the flip side, the very smooth \u201cCompany,\u201d featuring Travi$ Scott, and the sexy \u201cJungle\u201d prove Drake still has a way with R&B.;\n\nThere\u2019s no word yet on when Drake\u2019s tentatively titled \u201cViews from the 6\u201d will be released. But like any good mixtape, \u201cIf You\u2019re Reading This It\u2019s Too Late\u201d lays down promising ground work.\n\n___\n\nFollow Melanie Sims at twitter.com/MelanieJoySims", "article_metadata": {"description": "Drake, \"If You're Reading This It's Too Late\" (Cash Money)", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Drake, \u201cIf You\u2019re Reading This It\u2019s Too Late\u201d (Cash Money)", "title": "Music Review: Drake silences the jokes with cold, dark album", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/feb/16/music-review-drake-silences-the-jokes-with-cold-da/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/13/ecdb2ffe168200076e0f6a706700938f.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/13/ecdb2ffe168200076e0f6a706700938f.jpg", "description": "Drake, \"If You're Reading This It's Too Late\" (Cash Money)", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Music Review: Drake silences the jokes with cold, dark album"}, "Author": "MELANIE J.
