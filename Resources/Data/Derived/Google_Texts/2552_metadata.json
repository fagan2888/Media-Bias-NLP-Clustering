The Davis Institute for International Studies is named after them.\n\nJames Carafano, vice president of the institute\u2019s foreign policy and defense wing, says the money will allow his research teams to grow.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll draw on the endowment to sustain current programs,\u201d he said in an interview with The Hill. \u201cWe\u2019re focused on three major things, which is protection of American sovereignty, pressing the case for economic freedom and foreign policy, and making a strong national defense.\u201d\n\nThe grant amounts to about a third of its annual budget of $82.4 million.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWe are grateful beyond words for the Davis family\u2019s commitment to fostering the continuing research and development of policy proposals best calculated to spread the march of freedom, opportunity and prosperity around the globe,\u201d said Heritage Foundation President Jim DeMint in a statement. He resigned from the Senate last year after serving for South Carolina.\n\nMilitary action in Syria, the latest issue on the foreign policy front, has been one The Heritage Foundation has said it opposes.\n\nCarafano recently outlined five reasons why attacking Syria would be a bad idea: a vital U.S. interest wasn\u2019t at stake, missile attacks would make Obama look weaker, it wouldn\u2019t be wise, it isn\u2019t justified and it would distract the U.S. from other priorities.\n\nIts position on Syria is largely different from the interventionist attitude the foundation had three decades ago. During the 1980s, analysts helped craft the Reagan Doctrine, which provided support to anti-communist regimes during the Cold War.\n\nHeritage\u2019s former president, Edwin Feulner, says the two who inspired this hefty donation helped advance those goals under former President Reagan.\n\n\u201cI remember vividly traveling to the then-Soviet Union and China with Shelby and Kathryn trying to advance freedom in those communist countries,\u201d Feulner said. \u201cWe also traveled together to chisel away pieces of the Berlin Wall after it fell, a goal that they worked tirelessly to achieve.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The conservative research think tank will use the $26 million gift to advance foreign policy and defense studies.", "description": "The conservative research think tank will use the $26 million gift to advance foreign policy and defense studies.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Blog Briefing Room"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The conservative research think tank will use the $26 million gift to advance foreign policy and defense studies.", "title": "Heritage Foundation receives largest donation to date", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/322765-the-heritage-foundation-receives-its-biggest-donation-ever", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T04:59:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T04:59-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/322765-the-heritage-foundation-receives-its-biggest-donation-ever", "dcterms.date": "2013-09-17T18:35-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Rebecca Shabad", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "author": "Rebecca Shabad", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-17T18:35:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T04:59:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/322765-the-heritage-foundation-receives-its-biggest-donation-ever", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The conservative research think tank will use the $26 million gift to advance foreign policy and defense studies.", "card": "summary", "title": "Heritage Foundation receives largest donation to date"}, "dcterms.title": "Heritage Foundation receives largest donation to date"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9523\"", "article_summary": "Conservative research think tank, The Heritage Foundation, has received its biggest donation ever: $26 million.\nMilitary action in Syria, the latest issue on the foreign policy front, has been one The Heritage Foundation has said it opposes.\nThe family of its longtime funders, Kathryn and Shelby Cullom Davis, made the contribution to advance foreign policy and defense studies.\n\u201cI remember vividly traveling to the then-Soviet Union and China with Shelby and Kathryn trying to advance freedom in those communist countries,\u201d Feulner said.\nJames Carafano, vice president of the institute\u2019s foreign policy and defense wing, says the money will allow his research teams to grow."}
