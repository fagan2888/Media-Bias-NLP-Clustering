She said Chief Deputy James Odiorne threatened her job if she didn\u2019t rule the way Commissioner Mike Kreidler -- a supporter of the law -- wanted.\n\n\"If a judge is told by a party to decide his cases in a certain way, or one party can threaten the judge\u2019s job if the case is not decided in that party\u2019s favor, then this central pillar of our democratic society is corroded,\u201d Petersen said at a recent hearing called by the Senate Law and Justice Committee.\n\nOne of the cases before Petersen involved Seattle Children\u2019s Hospital, the premiere pediatric care facility in the Pacific Northwest. The hospital was kept out of the state health care exchange by Kreidler, who deemed Seattle Children\u2019s care too expensive.\n\nKreidler, speaking to Fox News in October 2013, said: \u201cYou\u2019re going to find that their business plan needs to be altered in order to really be competitive in the marketplace, so they\u2019re offering services at the most reasonable price.\u201d\n\nBut after Petersen granted Seattle Children\u2019s Hospital a hearing to appeal Kreidler\u2019s decision, Odiorne wrote this in a job evaluation: \u201cSince your orders are legally the acts of the Commissioner, they must be orders that he supports.\u201d\n\nRepublican lawmakers cried foul.\n\n\u201cShe has to be completely independent,\u201d said Republican state Sen. Randi Becker. \u201cShe has to be able to make her decisions, her rulings, based upon law, not upon somebody\u2019s desire.\u201d\n\nWashington State Auditor Troy Kelley, a Democrat, denied Petersen\u2019s request for whistleblower status. Kelley wrote, \u201cThere are other avenues available for addressing your assertion.\u201d\n\nPetersen was then placed on paid leave and became the subject of an investigation for mailing a copy of her original complaint to an attorney who represents Seattle Children\u2019s Hospital. She claims the \"ex parte\" communication was an inadvertent mistake.\n\nBut several Democrats say Petersen is wrong about her independence. She is a 28-year employee in the OIC and, according to some, is Kreidler\u2019s designee.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s his work,\u201d said Democratic state Sen. Adam Kline. \u201cShe is sitting at his desk when this happens. And she is emphatically not an independent judge.\u201d\n\nThe OIC website seems to contradict that claim. In the section on appealing the commissioner\u2019s rulings, the department writes, \u201cAdministrative hearings are legal proceedings to review the commissioner\u2019s action before an impartial judge.\u201d It later states, \u201cThe decision of the Chief Presiding Officer becomes the final decision of the agency and is not subject to review by the Commissioner or any member of his staff.\u201d\n\nPaul Guppy, a senior policy analyst for the Washington Policy Center, a libertarian-leaning think tank, said the scandal is driven by support for a law that won\u2019t work on its own to lower the cost of health care.\n\n\u201cAs the Affordable Care Act is pushed in Washington state, more and more of these contradictions emerge, and this case is just one of them,\u201d Guppy said.\n\nThe insurance commissioner declined Fox News' request for an interview, saying the office was conducting its own independent personnel investigation. The lawyer doing the probe was selected by his office.\n\nDan Springer joined Fox News Channel (FNC) in August 2001 as a Seattle-based correspondent.", "article_metadata": {"prism.subsection1":
