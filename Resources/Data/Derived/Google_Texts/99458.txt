Indianapolis-based Anthem this morning released its first quarter financials, which showed a net income of $703 million, compared to $865 million in the same quarter past year – a 19% decrease.

As many companies’ first-quarter earnings roll in, health insurers are being carefully watched for clues as to how they are faring selling policies on Affordable Care Act exchanges, especially after the country’s biggest insurer, UnitedHealth Group, said last week it would exit most of those exchanges due to hundreds of millions in losses from them.

Revenue climbed 6.5 percent to $20.3 billion in the quarter.

Anthem sells these plans in the 14 states where it operates Blue Cross Blue Shield plans.

Medicaid membership rose 7.6% from the prior-year period to 6.05 million in the quarter.

Rising enrollment and increased premiums also helped boost revenue, the company said.

The insurer ended the quarter with 975,000 members in its individual public exchange business, an increase of 184,000 year-over-year.
