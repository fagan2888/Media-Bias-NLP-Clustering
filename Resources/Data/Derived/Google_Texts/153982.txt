On HBO's "Veep," Julia Louis Dreyfuss' character Selina Meyer accuses her opponents of sexism when they disagree with her on policy. It's comical. When Hillary Clinton tries to do the same thing in a real life election cycle, it's 'pathetic.' So said the "Morning Joe" panel on MSNBC Tuesday morning.

“That was pathetic,” Brzezinski said. “I know that she’s the front-runner. I’m sure she’s going to win, and I’m glad. I want a Democrat to win, but that was like Veep. That was Veep. It was worse than Veep. It wasn’t funny.”

Over the weekend, Bernie Sanders threw some direct criticism Clinton's way regarding gun control, saying 'all the shouting in the world' won't keep guns out of criminals' hands. Clinton apparently couldn't take the heat without using the gender card.

“I haven’t been shouting, but sometimes when a woman speaks out, some people think it’s shouting,” she said.

Clinton's over sensitivity disgusted the "Morning Joe" panel. Brzezinski, who, as indicated above, is a Hillary supporter, could not help calling out her campaign's 'stupidity.'

“I know sexism," she said. "Hillary Clinton knows sexism. She should know better than to let her staff make her do that. It needs to be her. She needs to get out there and talk. Everyone stop writing lines for her. They’re bad. Really bad. When we talk about sexism, when we talk about women and equal pay and all these things that are important, let’s not denigrate it with that stupidity, because we embarrass ourselves.”

Looks like that Clinton staff drought on "Morning Joe" will continue.
