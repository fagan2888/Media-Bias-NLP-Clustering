Argentine pianist Ingrid Fliter joins the Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra on Friday and Saturday to play Chopin's Piano Concerto No. 2 in F minor, one of the Polish composer's few orchestral works.

Music director Edo de Waart and the orchestra will also perform Brahms' Symphony No. 2 in D major and contemporary composer Michael Ippolito's Nocturne for Orchestra, which Ippolito said was inspired by Joan Miró's painting of the same name.

Concerts begin at 11:15 a.m. Friday and 8 p.m. Saturday in the Marcus Center's Uihlein Hall, 929 N. Water St. Tickets are $25 to $105. Call (414) 291-7605 or visit the Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra website.

"Meet the Music" pre-show discussions begin an hour before each concert. There also will be a pre-concert fashion show at 10:15 a.m. Friday in the Marcus Center's Bradley Pavilion.
