Meanwhile, they ignored what the company said was the reason.\n\nThe discussion opened with co-host Steve Doocy noting that McDonald\u2019s had reported a 30% drop in its corporate profits.\n\n\u201cWell, it turns out workers\u2019 wages might be to blame,\u201d Brian Kilmeade said.\n\nWell, it turns out they probably are not to blame. As Media Matters pointed out:\n\nMcDonald\u2019s CEO Don Thompson \u201cowned up to some corporate image problems\u201d as an explanation for the drop in profits, according to Reuters. The AP also detailed the fast-food company\u2019s image problems.\n\nBut guest Maria Bartiromo, of Fox Business, validated the conjecture:\n\nBARTIROMO: Well, the issue really is, this is the implication of raising the minimum wage for certain companies. I mean, something\u2019s got to give. The money comes from somewhere. So, at some point, a company will say, \u201cOK, we have a higher expense rate because we\u2019re raising the minimum wage we\u2019ve got to do something somewhere else.\u201d In this case, they are going to automation. They are changing certain jobs to computers.\n\nCo-host Ainsley Earhardt furthered the meme: \u201cSo it\u2019s really biting them in the tail. They were complaining, saying, \u2018We want more money,\u2019 and as a result, McDonald\u2019s saying, \u2018Hey, we\u2019re going to lose some of you guys, and we\u2019re going to replace you with machines.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cThe fact is it\u2019s not just about $10 an hour,\u201d Bartiromo added. \u201cIt\u2019s about $10 an hour plus a benefit package: you know, benefit, vacation and of course, we know the expense of ObamaCare. As a result, companies have to do something. So it\u2019s either go toward automation, hire fewer workers, take some workers to part time vs. full time. \u2026Something\u2019s got to give somewhere.\u201d\n\nNice touch throwing in the ObamaCare, don\u2019t you think?\n\nMeanwhile, as Media Matters also noted, nobody mentioned one other thing: The McDonald\u2019s CEO is fine with a minimum wage hike.\n\nBut what would he know?\n\n(H/T reader Eric J.)\n\nWatch the discussion below, from yesterday's Fox & Friends.", "article_metadata": {"csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "google-site-verification": "google51c0b549f514d464.html", "csrf-token": "Nvnd+tyBFa/7W64I/vQEHZz1etvRggZow8+p0rRrb5o=", "og": {"url": "http://www.newshounds.us/fox_baselessly_blames_wage_hikes_for_drop_in_mcdonald_s_profit_10232014", "type": "article", "image": "http://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/newshounds/sites/1/meta_images/original/Newshound3_blue.png?1327001871", "site_name": "NewsHounds", "title": "Fox Baselessly Blames Wage Hikes For Drop In McDonald\u2019s Profit"}, "Title": "Fox Baselessly Blames Wage Hikes For Drop In McDonald\u2019s Profit"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf400\"", "article_summary": "Fox & Friends discussed McDonald\u2019s' reported drop in profits by speculating that calls for a higher minimum wage were to blame.\nMeanwhile, as Media Matters also noted, nobody mentioned one other thing: The McDonald\u2019s CEO is fine with a minimum wage hike.\nBut guest Maria Bartiromo, of Fox Business, validated the conjecture:BARTIROMO: Well, the issue really is, this is the implication of raising the minimum wage for certain companies.\nThe discussion opened with co-host Steve Doocy noting that McDonald\u2019s had reported a 30% drop in its corporate profits.\n\u201cWell, it turns out workers\u2019 wages might be to blame,\u201d Brian Kilmeade said."}
