Some comments on \u201cChicken craze comes home to roost\u201d (Oct. 9):\n\nFirst, the problem of what to do with unwanted chickens as winter sets in is a First World, 21st-century, upper-middle-class problem.\n\nThe simple answer is: You eat them. People have been doing it for millennia now. You slow-roast an old bird covered and with a little water, and it is delicious! Or you turn it into broth. I\u2019m sure most of the people giving up their birds eat chicken from the store. It\u2019s a commentary on how far we have come from the source of our food that this is not obvious. To me, it\u2019s an argument for increasing the number of people who raise their own food.\n\nSecond, coops don\u2019t need to be heated in the wintertime. If you get heirloom, dual-purpose breeds, they are cold-hardy. They weren\u2019t lighting a fire for the chickens on the farm in 1870; today is no different. I don\u2019t heat my coop in the winter, and I\u2019ve never had birds freezing to death. In fact, ventilation is more important than heat, as chickens exhale a lot of moisture as they breathe.\n\nThird, chickens are not companion animals. They are livestock. They may be able to bond with you to a certain degree, and they do have individual personalities, but they aren\u2019t cuddly and loyal like a dog. If you\u2019ve been around chickens, you\u2019d know that they are fun to watch, but they aren\u2019t a house pet.\n\nFourth, with regard to illnesses, back-yard chickens are pretty safe. They don\u2019t live in the house, which is how many diseases are transmitted between birds and humans in Asia. And they aren\u2019t confined 50,000 to a large pen as on industrial farms, which is where the problems really come in. That the subject of the Oct. 9 story keeps chickens in her basement is more disturbing to me than the thought of some people not being ready for chicken ownership.\n\nFinally, we are not all urban hipsters, a group the story\u2019s author clearly disdains. Most of us raise our flocks responsibly and manage the lives our birds from beginning to end with an eye to their health and well-being.\n\nSlaughtering a chicken that you raised from birth is part of keeping chickens. Or you can take it to the Hmong slaughterhouse in South St. Paul, and they will do it for you for about $6. Frankly, 500 unwanted birds is probably a drop in the bucket compared with the number of back-yard chickens out there.\n\nI would hope that the Star Tribune in the future would handle the subject a little more even-handedly.\n\nMatthew Koncar lives in Lauderdale.", "article_metadata": {"description": "For those who see tending to back-yard coops as the livestock management it is, winter isn't a problem.", "og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "For those who see tending to back-yard coops as the livestock management it is, winter isn't a problem.", "title": "Counterpoint: Myths about the so-called 'chicken craze'", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/counterpoint-myths-about-the-so-called-chicken-craze/227456341/", "image": {"url": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_138153482033810.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=top", "width": 1200, "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_138153482033810.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=top", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "For those who see tending to back-yard coops as the livestock management it is, winter isn't a problem.", "title": "Counterpoint: Myths about the so-called 'chicken craze'", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/counterpoint-myths-about-the-so-called-chicken-craze/227456341/", "image": {"src": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_138153482033810.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=top", "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_138153482033810.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=top"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "article": {"tag": "Minnesota"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "news_keywords": "chickens,Lauderdale, Minnesota"}, "article_summary": "Frankly, 500 unwanted birds is probably a drop in the bucket compared with the number of back-yard chickens out there.\nSome comments on \u201cChicken craze comes home to roost\u201d (Oct. 9):First, the problem of what to do with unwanted chickens as winter sets in is a First World, 21st-century, upper-middle-class problem.\nI\u2019m sure most of the people giving up their birds eat chicken from the store.\nI have been raising chickens for four years, responsibly managing an urban, home flock of between eight and 35 birds.\nSlaughtering a chicken that you raised from birth is part of keeping chickens."}
