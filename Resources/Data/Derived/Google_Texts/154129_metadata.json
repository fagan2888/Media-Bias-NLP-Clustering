Eat. Tweet. Etc. Exhausting. -;(),\u201d Mary Lee responded.\n\nThe shark, which was tagged off the coast of Cape Cod, is among hundreds of sharks that OCEARCH, a Utah-based organization, has tagged and tracked since 2007.\n\nThe fake Twitter handle isn\u2019t affiliated with OCEARCH (pronounced Oh-Search). But OCEARCH expedition leader Chris Fischer, who named Mary Lee after his mother, says the organization appreciates the attention the maritime missives have generated.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re really clever, they really like sharks and they\u2019re on mission, so we\u2019re just kind of rolling with it,\u201d he said from the organization\u2019s latest expedition in Australia.\n\nOCEARCH has even jumped on the bandwagon, launching \u201cofficial\u201d Twitter handles for two other sharks it\u2019s monitoring off the East Coast. @Shark_Katharine and @RockStarLydia both have sizable followings of their own.\n\nThe person behind the @MaryLeeShark account did surface when The Associated Press sent a Twitter message.\n\nThe account\u2019s operator identified themselves only as a daily newspaper reporter living on the East Coast and expressed pleasant surprise at the attention \u2014 and OCEARCH\u2019s support.\n\n\u201cThe recent explosion of followers has been a lot of fun, but also like a second job. I do everything manually \u2013 no robo tweets,\u201d the account owner wrote. \u201cThe best part is that (@MaryLeeShark) plays a role in helping to replace fear with facts by retweeting and commenting on @OCEARCH tweets. I (try) to be respectful of the important work OCEARCH does and have fun at the same time.\u201d\n\nOCEARCH\u2019s multi-year project uses GPS trackers affixed to the shark\u2019s dorsal fin to post real time data on dozens of great whites across the globe \u2014 Mary Lee was hanging out near Ocean City, Maryland on Sunday, for example \u2014 with the goal of better understanding the shark\u2019s life cycle and encouraging conservation of the endangered ocean predators.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Great white shark cruising East Coast becomes Twitter star", "title": "Great white shark cruising East Coast becomes Twitter star", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Great white shark cruising East Coast becomes Twitter star", "title": "Great white shark cruising East Coast becomes Twitter star", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/17/great_white_shark_cruising_east_coast_becomes_twitter_star/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/great-white-shark-tracker.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Great white shark cruising East Coast becomes Twitter star", "title": "Great white shark cruising East Coast becomes Twitter star", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/great-white-shark-tracker.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Philip Marcelo", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "She\u2019s drawn over 44,000 followers with her playful updates and witty replies as real life shark cruises up and down the East Coast.\nyou\u2019re right by my house, come by for a nightcap?\u201d invited one recent Twitter commenter as she popped up off the coast of Long Island, New York.\nOCEARCH has even jumped on the bandwagon, launching \u201cofficial\u201d Twitter handles for two other sharks it\u2019s monitoring off the East Coast.\n-:()\u201d Mary Lee replied.\n@MaryLeeShark is the fake Twitter handle for a very real, nearly 3,500-pound great white whose movements can be tracked online and in real time."}
