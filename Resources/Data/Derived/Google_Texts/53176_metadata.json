What they wanted was their very own Tea Party.\u201d\n\nThe Occupy movement briefly seemed to provide one, but it lacked the Tea Party\u2019s staying power. Still, the passions that animated the Occupiers have breathed new life into the left, from the East Coast \u2014 where Bill de Blasio won election as New York\u2019s new mayor on a promise to end economic inequalities \u2014 to the West, where Kshama Sawant, a member of the Socialist Alternative Party, won a seat on the Seattle City Council by campaigning for a $15 minimum wage.\n\nVictories like those have inspired imitation: Several candidates in the Northeast have expropriated de Blasio\u2019s \u201ctale of two cities\u201d theme for their own campaigns, and President Obama ended 2012 with a speech calling economic inequality \u201cthe defining issue of our time.\u201d\n\nAll of this has the liberal commentariat rapturous. The abstract notion of equality is the lodestar of the American left, just as the abstract notion of liberty is the lodestar of the right. Or at least some liberty: Most conservatives care greatly about the economic kind, and the sight of an entrepreneur caught up in red tape enrages them. But certain conservatives care less about other kinds of liberty, such as the freedom of gays and lesbians to pursue their own happiness as they define it, or the freedom of a young black male in a hoodie to walk down the street with a bag of Skittles unaccosted.\n\nLikewise, the left is selective in its ardor for equality. It is stirred by the cause of social equality for minority groups, and by economic equality for all. Other kinds of equality matter less \u2014 e.g., to evangelicals, the belief that we are all equal in the eyes of God is an immensely important social leveler. To at least the secular left, this solidarity of faith seems not only insignificant but potentially malignant \u2014 an \u201copiate of the masses,\u201d as Marx called religion generally.\n\nEven on the question of economic inequality, many on the left tend to focus only on one dimension: the gap between the rich and poor. Conventional liberal opinion holds that the gap is bad not only because of its consequences, but inherently \u2014 and the bigger the gap, the worse things are.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t follow. As self-described \u201cliberaltarian\u201d Will Wilkinson noted in a 2009 paper, U.S. inequality as measured by the Gini Coefficient (the most common measure of such inequality) is about the same as in Ghana. But being poor in the U.S. is much better than being poor \u2013 or for that matter rich \u2013 in Ghana. This raises another point Wilkinson makes, about consumption: When you look at how people actually live, what they have in the bank matters much less than their daily experience.\n\nThe difference between having a car of any kind or none at all is vastly greater than the difference between having a used Chevy and a new Porsche. And while the rich in the U.S. have gotten richer, so have the poor: Since 1979 the income of the poorest 20 percent of Americans has almost doubled, and market economics has provided them with riches, such as cellphones, once available only to the most well-off. This helps explain why the difference in happiness among income groups in the U.S. is vastly smaller than the difference in wealth. Which of those measures should matter more?\n\nFocusing only on inequalities of result also ignores another important dimension to the question. Again, Wilkinson: \u201cIt\u2019s not enough to identify a mechanism of rising inequality. An additional argument is required to show that there is some kind of injustice or wrongdoing involved.\u201d\n\nIt is possible that inequality is rising because the system has grown more rigged. But as Mickey Kaus pointed out recently, while you would expect inequality in a rigged system, you also should expect it in a fair one: \u201cOnce the meritocratic centrifuge has sorted everyone out, there won\u2019t be that many talented people at the bottom to rise in heartening success stories.\u201d Divining how much truth there is in these competing narratives is vastly more complex than ideologues of any stripe would like to think.\n\nCorrecting inequalities caused by system-rigging is desirable, but \u201ccorrecting\u201d (as opposed to merely alleviating) inequalities caused by merit-sorting would actually be unjust. It also would require creating an inequality of a different sort: the inequality of authority.\n\nPerpetual market interventions in the name of economic equality require a perpetual class of interveners who have the power to overrule the free choices made by everyone else.\n\nNaturally, those coercive interventions require handing the levers of coercion over to progressives \u2014 which explains why this sort of inequality never seems to bother them in the slightest.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Is equality of income more important than equality of justice and authority?", "title": "The Great Inequality Debate", "url": "http://reason.com/archives/2014/01/08/the-great-inequality-debate", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/13891906007815.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@reason", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/13891906007815.jpg", "description": "Writing in Commentary not long ago, Seth Mandel drew out a nice\npoint about the resurgence of the Democratic left: \u201cComplaints over\nthe last few years about the GOP being pulled to the right by\nconservatives,\u201d he wrote, \u201cwere not about liberals\u2019 desire to meet\nin the middle and compromise, no matter how much they might decry\nthe supposed extremist drift of the right.
