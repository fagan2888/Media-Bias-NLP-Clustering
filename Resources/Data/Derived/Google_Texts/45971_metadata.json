Skulpt divided the largest muscle groups into 10 different categories \u2014 biceps, abs, calves, and so on \u2014 and labeled which specific muscles were strongest in each state. Turns out, very few states like to work out their calves.\n\n\"By in large, most gym goers tend to focus on the most visible and most talked about body parts,\" Skulpt advisor George Dorsey told NY Daily News. \u201cFor men, it's normally arms and chest and for women it's mostly hips and abs.\"\n\nIn Wisconsin, gym goers seemed to spend more time on their shoulders, while it's all about the glutes in Las Vegas. Overall, the four most muscular states were all located in the South: Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi, and Tennessee.\n\nSkulpt used an Electrical Impedance Myography (EIM) device to measure the country's muscle group strengths. Holding the EIM over a muscle group, it sends out an electrical current through the skin. The device\u2019s high frequency moves through fat and muscle layers to measure the muscles' fiber quality and fat percentage. A person\u2019s fat-to-muscle ratio can change throughout a day, which makes measuring and monitoring each muscle group an effective way to track small changes. It\u2019s those small changes that will make the big difference when working towards certain fitness goals.\n\nAccording to experts at BodyBuilding.com, this should include your lower body. Legs represent the largest muscles on the body and can provide athletes with an immense amount of endurance and power.\n\nCheck out Skulpt's fitness map to see which muscle groups are strongest in your state.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "leg, day, overrated, americans, swap, squats, more, arm, and, chest, exercises", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Fitness app Skulpt measures and ranks muscle groups throughout the country by strength, revealing the nation's weaknesses.", "title": "The Most Muscular States In America", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/leg-day-overrated-americans-swap-squats-more-arm-and-chest-exercises-349076", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured/public/2015/08/23/muscle-groups.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Fitness app Skulpt measures and ranks muscle groups throughout the country by strength, revealing the nation's weaknesses.", "title": "The Most Muscular States In America", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/leg-day-overrated-americans-swap-squats-more-arm-and-chest-exercises-349076", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured/public/2015/08/23/muscle-groups.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/08/23/muscle-groups.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Vitality", "published_time": "2015-08-23T17:02:34-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-24T12:53:11-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Fitness app Skulpt measures and ranks muscle groups throughout the country by strength, revealing the nation's weaknesses."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2603\"", "article_summary": "Holding the EIM over a muscle group, it sends out an electrical current through the skin.\nSkulpt used an Electrical Impedance Myography (EIM) device to measure the country's muscle group strengths.\nA person\u2019s fat-to-muscle ratio can change throughout a day, which makes measuring and monitoring each muscle group an effective way to track small changes.\nLeg day should not be skipped, yet Americans frequently forget (and neglect) their lower body, according to a new report from fitness tracker company Skulpt.\nThe device\u2019s high frequency moves through fat and muscle layers to measure the muscles' fiber quality and fat percentage."}
