For American Indians and Alaska Natives, the process is a little different.\n\nAlaska Native Tribal Health Consortium, United Way, and the Southeast Alaska Regional Health Consortium have teamed up at Juneau\u2019s Gold Medal Basketball Tournament to inform as many Alaska Natives as possible.\n\nJamie Paddock traveled from Hoonah to cheer on her hometown team. Attending Gold Medal is an annual tradition.\n\nIn between games, she visits a health care information table.\n\n\u201cMy grandfather told me I might win a gift card if I sign up here,\u201d Paddock says.\n\nPaddock isn\u2019t actually signing up for anything. She\u2019s filling out an Indian Status Exemption form.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit of a complicated form even though it\u2019s pretty short. It\u2019s only three pages but there are some tricky questions,\u201d says Monique Martin with the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium. \u201cAnd it just means that if you don\u2019t have health insurance you could face a tax penalty and if you send in that exemption that gives you a lifetime exemption from the requirements of the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nPaddock\u2019s heath care provider is Southeast Alaska Regional Health Consortium, which doesn\u2019t require insurance. But she does have Blue Cross as well as Medicaid.\n\n\u201cWe have a very robust tribal health system in the state of Alaska. The exemption is to acknowledge that Alaska Natives and American Indians have access to tribal health and Indian Health Services to get their health care needs met,\u201d Martin says.\n\nAlaska Native Tribal Health Consortium is targeting almost 50,000 Alaska Natives without insurance. They\u2019re the ones who could face a tax penalty.\n\n\u201cThe exemption form does not eliminate your ability to get insurance either at healthcare.gov or through an employer. It just covers you in the case that you have a gap in your insurance coverage,\u201d Martin says.\n\nSo far, the tribal health consortium has helped fill out more than 2,200 Indian Status Exemption forms. One form can cover an individual or family.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve also sent out thousands of emails or also we print them up and mail them to people in rural parts of our state,\u201d Martin says.\n\nOnly a paper version of the exemption form is available this year. You print it, fill it in, and mail it. Or have it all done at Gold Medal.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t forget to include a copy of either a tribal enrollment card or some proof that you\u2019re an ANCSA shareholder or a copy of your Certificate of Indian Blood card issued by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. If you don\u2019t, the feds will send you back a letter saying your application is not complete,\u201d Martin explains.\n\nA health care information table will be at Gold Medal through Saturday.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been from Barrow to Ketchikan, from Bethel to Fairbanks, Iliamna, Dillingham, Kotzebue, Nome. We\u2019ve been to lots and lots of places to spread the word,\u201d Martin says.\n\nOpen enrollment for Alaska Natives interested in getting health insurance is ongoing; there is no deadline.\n\nAnd Alaska Natives have until the end of the year to submit an Indian Status Exemption form, although if you do it at Gold Medal, you could win a gift card.\n\nRelated articles\n\nComments", "article_metadata": {"category": "Alaska Native Arts & Culture,Community,Featured News,Health", "description": "Here's what Alaska Natives need to know about the Affordable Care Act.", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "author": "Lisa Phu", "og": {"site_name": "KTOO", "description": "Here's what Alaska Natives need to know about the Affordable Care Act.", "title": "What Alaska Natives need to know about the Affordable Care Act", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 4752, "identifier": "http://www.ktoo.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_4007.jpg", "height": 3168}, "updated_time": "2014-03-19T08:49:48-08:00", "url": "http://www.ktoo.org/2014/03/19/alaska-natives-need-know-affordable-care-act/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Here's what Alaska Natives need to know about the Affordable Care Act.", "creator": "@ktoolisa", "image": "http://www.ktoo.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_4007.jpg", "title": "What Alaska Natives need to know about the Affordable Care Act", "site": "@KTOOpubmedia", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "nid": 86896, "fb": {"admins": "100000451568550,1057430445,64202921,5701326,100009904184202,100000548846198,100000571087086,100005265339889,657797481,698475886,100002322833863,529595225,1074192195", "app_id": 129011767246539}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.ktoo.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/cropped-KTOO_favicon-270x270.png", "keywords": "Affordable Care Act,Alaska Native,Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium,Gold Medal Basketball Tournament,health care,Indian Status Exemption form,Jamie Paddock,Monique Martin,Southeast Alaska Regional Health Consortium,tribal health,United Way of Southeast Alaska", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ktoopublicmedia", "section": "Alaska Native Arts & Culture", "tag": "United Way of Southeast Alaska", "published_time": "2014-03-19T06:00:18-08:00", "modified_time": "2014-03-19T08:49:48-08:00"}, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "(Photo by Lisa Phu/KTOO)For most Americans, the deadline to sign up for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act is March 31.\nAlaska Native Tribal Health Consortium, United Way, and the Southeast Alaska Regional Health Consortium have teamed up at Juneau\u2019s Gold Medal Basketball Tournament to inform as many Alaska Natives as possible.\nAlaska Native Tribal Health Consortium is targeting almost 50,000 Alaska Natives without insurance.\nOpen enrollment for Alaska Natives interested in getting health insurance is ongoing; there is no deadline.\n(Photo by Lisa Phu/KTOO) The crowd at Gold Medal during Tuesday night's basketball game between Klukwan and Sitka."}
