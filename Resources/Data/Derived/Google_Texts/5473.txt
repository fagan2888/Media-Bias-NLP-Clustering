The Nuggets released their summer league roster on Monday, and first round draft pick Jusuf Nurkic was not on it.

Nurkic has a conflict with the Bosnian national team, which he committed to play for long before he was drafted by an NBA franchise. The Nuggets had been busily trying to broker a deal that would get him on their summer league team, but were not able to secure him for the full tournament. They had held out hope that if not available for the whole thing, he might be able to play at least some during summer league, which runs from July 11-21 in Las Vegas. It remains to be seen if that can be worked out.

The second of the Nuggets first-round draft picks, shooting guard Gary Harris, is on the roster, as is Quincy Miller, who just finished his second NBA season. Also of note are local college products, Carlon Brown (CU) and Brandon Jefferson (Metro State).

Nuggets 2013 draft pick Erick Green is on the roster as well.
