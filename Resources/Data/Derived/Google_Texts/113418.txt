A northwest Iowa restaurant is offering its customers an incentive to put away their cell phones and talk to each other.



Sneaky's Chicken promises a 10 percent discount to customers who give up their cell phones while eating dinner at the restaurant on Wednesdays.



Owner Dave Ferris and his daughter, general manager Christy Wright, came up with the idea after they noticed a decline in conversation among customers who seemed preoccupied with their cell phones.



Wright says nearly all their customers participate in the promotion by putting their phones in a box their server brings to the table.
