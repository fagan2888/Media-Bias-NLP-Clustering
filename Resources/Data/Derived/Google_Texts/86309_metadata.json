The collapse disrupted coverage for 215,000 customers, stuck hospitals and other health providers with hundreds of millions of dollars in unpaid claims and left federal taxpayers with a quarter-billion dollars of uncollectible debt.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t an isolated case. Of 23 insurance co-ops launched under President Obama\u2019s health-reform law, 12 will be out of business by Jan. 1. That failure rate of more than 50 percent raises obvious questions about the workability of the co-op model and Washington\u2019s management.\n\nYet of more direct concern for New York is an apparent breakdown in state oversight.\n\nHealth Republic\u2019s growing financial troubles should\u2019ve been no surprise to insurance regulators at the Department of Financial Services. The company\u2019s filings showed steep operating losses, mounting debt, unanticipated costs and heavy reliance on a federal subsidy Congress slashed in 2014.\n\nYet the state didn\u2019t intervene to order an increase in Health Republic\u2019s premiums, as other states did in similar situations. Instead, it repeatedly cut the company\u2019s premiums below what the insurer had requested, aggravating the co-op\u2019s losses. The department\u2019s most recent cut was announced in July, less than two months before Albany moved to shut the insurer down.\n\nAside from the political implications, it highlights a conflict between the department\u2019s longstanding regulatory role \u2014 which is to assure that health plans are financially sound \u2014 and rate-setting authority granted by the Legislature in 2010.\n\nA look at the trendline of annual premiums before and after enactment of that law, known as \u201cprior approval,\u201d suggests it\u2019s having no clear impact on New York\u2019s health-insurance costs compared to national averages. So consumers might be better off if Albany kept its entire regulatory focus on the financial health of insurance companies while leaving price-setting to market forces.\n\nIn fact, the numbers show the affordability gap between insurance costs in New York and those in the rest of the country dropped markedly after a previous prior-approval statute was fully repealed in 2000.\n\nSince 2011, when the reinstated law took effect, the gap has returned to double digits in three of four years. So far, there\u2019s no clear trend up or down, but certainly no justification for price controls.\n\nThe full story of Health Republic\u2019s failure remains murky. After initially ordering the company to close by December, the DFS accelerated the closure to Nov. 30, saying it had learned the company\u2019s finances were \u201csubstantially worse than the company previously reported to the state\u201d and promising an investigation of the plans\u2019 \u201cinaccurate representations.\u201d\n\nStill, what Health Republic did report was worrisome enough: steady losses, heavy debt and mushrooming dependence on a federal subsidy that was slashed by Congress. Moreover, it was a brand-new company, built on an untested model, navigating the unpredictable tides of a rapidly changing health-care system.\n\nIf Albany spotted these red flags, it took no obvious steps to address them. What it did do was further reduce Health Republic\u2019s inadequate premiums in an attempt to prioritize affordability.\n\nA DFS spokesman declined to comment on these decisions or the ongoing investigation.\n\nAs regulators, officials and legislators study what went wrong, they should recognize that price-setting is a dangerous distraction from what should be their primary mission \u2014 preventing the next insurance-plan collapse.\n\nIf the goal is making health coverage more affordable, the surest way to achieve that isn\u2019t for the state to impose price controls, but for it to roll back its own high taxes and costly coverage mandates.\n\n\n\nBill Hammond has two decades of experience covering New York government and health policy.
