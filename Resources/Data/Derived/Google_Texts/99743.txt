Michelle Obama appeared on “The Tonight Show starring Jimmy Fallon” Thursday to sell Obamacare:

Fallon: While you’re here, I have to talk to you — I want to talk to you about the Affordable Care Act. March, is there a deadline?

Obama: The end of March, absolutely, yes it is.

Fallon: Because a lot of young people watch our show. Would you like to tell me — why would they — because a lot people don’t have the money to spend on this.

Obama: Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, young people can stay on their parents’ insurance until they are 26. But once they hit 26, they’re on their own and a lot of young people think they are invincible. But the truth is, young people are knuckleheads, you know? They’re the ones who are cooking for the first time and slice their finger open. They’re dancing on the bar stool. They’re, you know.

Fallon: Young people. Yea, yea, yea, yea. I would never do both of those things just last summer. No, no, no.

Obama: But while young people think they’re invincible, they’re not. You know, life happens. And as a mother, and I know there are a lot of moms out there who worry that their kids are going to, you know, have a a terrible accident, get a bad diagnosis and they won’t have health care. And before they couldn’t get it because they couldn’t afford it. And now young people can get insurance for as little as $50 a month, less than the cost of gym shoes. And, you know, for the moms and dads who are out there worried about their kids, we want you to encourage your kids to sign up for that peace of mind that we all look for.

Fallon: Healthcare.gov is the website if you haven’t read about it in the news or anything. Yea, you know what it is. It’s up and running.

Obama: It’s working!

Fallon: It’s working now. It’s so much better when it’s working.

Obama: It helps. That helps.
