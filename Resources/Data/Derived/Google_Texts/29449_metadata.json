Jerry Sonnenberg, the sponsor of Senate Bill 19, which passed the Senate Health and Human Services Committee Wednesday on a unanimous vote.\n\n\u201cTaxpayers deserve to know if their money is being spent appropriately and this legislation is a big step forward for accountability at Colorado\u2019s health care exchange. It\u2019s a shame that partisan Democrats and Connect for Health fought this audit so hard last year instead of opening up their books for inspection. In the meantime we\u2019ve seen rampant mismanagement and misplaced priorities instead of responsible stewardship of taxpayer dollars.\u201d\n\nThe same panel also advanced Senate Bill 52, which would require any bonus for executives at Connect for Health Colorado to be approved by the Legislative Health Benefit Exchange Implementation Review Committee.\n\nThat 3-2 vote broke along party lines with the committee\u2019s Democrats voting against the bill.\n\nSen. Larry Crowder, R-Alamosa, brought the bill forward following news last year that the exchange awarded its former CEO Patty Fontenau a $14,000 bonus.\n\n\u201cColoradans expect their tax dollars to be spent wisely and awarding bonuses to executives of a struggling organization like Connect for Health Colorado doesn\u2019t live up to that standard,\u201d said Crowder. \u201cI\u2019m proud this bill has passed committee and I look forward to it passing both chambers of the legislature and being signed by Governor Hickenlooper.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"geo.position": "39.739236;-104.990251", "description": "DENVER -- Last year when Republicans called for an audit of Colorado's new health insurance exchange, Democrats voted the measure down.
