( Adizah Eghan/KQED )\n\nEast Oakland\u2019s Allen Temple Baptist Church is buzzing with chatter and upbeat music. On this warm Saturday morning, the church is hosting its annual holistic health fair.\n\nStudents from Oakland\u2019s Samuel Merritt University, clad in blue scrubs, hustle to give eye exams and check blood pressure.\n\nA couple tables down, Samuel Merritt\u2019s chief diversity officer, Shirley Strong, hopes to address prospective students. The Oakland-based university is one of the three biggest programs for registered nursing students in California and is committed to reducing health disparities by recruiting more students of color .\n\n\u201cThe work of diversity at Samuel Merritt involves recruiting faculty, staff and students of color particularly,\u201d Strong says, especially \u201cAfrican-American/black, Latino/Hispanic students because they\u2019re the ones underrepresented in our community.\u201d\n\nLast May, Samuel Merritt University\u2019s nursing program graduated its second-largest class of African-American and Latino students, including 10 African-Americans and 28 Latinos.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019d like to do is train more (registered nurses) and more case managers and more nurse practitioners, people who are really in decision-making roles in hospitals,\u201d says Strong.\n\nBlack and Latino Registered Nurses Needed\n\nThe majority of the state\u2019s registered nurses are white or Asian. While 39 percent of California\u2019s population is Latino, just 8 percent of nurses are; 6 percent of the state\u2019s population is black, but just 4 percent of nurses are.\n\nDavid Hayes-Bautista is director of the Center for the Study of Latino Health and Culture at UCLA\u2019s medical school.\n\n\u201cClearly we are lacking African-American and Latina nurses,\u201d he says, adding that the health of everyone suffers because of it. \u201cHaving them in the workforce will \u2026 make for better patient care [and] better language communication.\u201d\n\nBut that can be hard when you have a population as diverse as California, where Latinos lack access to preventive care and African-Americans experience higher rates of heart disease and shorter life expectancy than whites.\n\nThese disparities are what motivated Samuel Merritt grad Shanda Williams, who recently passed her registered nurses\u2019 licensing exam.\n\nShe grew up in Oakland, where there\u2019s a great need for providers who understand the community. Williams says she\u2019s experienced this firsthand.\n\n\u201cI would go to the doctor\u2019s office with my grandmother,\u201d Williams says, \u201cand she would basically lie to all of her doctors about everything that she was doing.\u201d\n\nWilliams says her grandmother told her doctor she was eating her fruits and vegetables and cutting out fried foods. Williams knew this was not true.\n\n\u201cIt sparked a conversation,\u201d she says, but her grandmother \u201cbasically said, \u2018They don\u2019t understand the way we eat, this is part of my identity.\u2019 \u201d\n\nWilliams says this moment stuck with her because the doctor never asked some key questions.\n\n\u201cThere was never really a time when her doctor would ask her a question, \u2018Well, why do you eat that way?\u2019 or, \u2018Can we find a compromise?\u2019 or anything like that. Those questions never came up.\u201d\n\nHelping Others Achieve\n\nNow Williams wants to extend what she\u2019s learned to others. She tutors in Samuel Merritt\u2019s academic success program, specifically geared toward Latino and African-American students. Today she\u2019s working with junior Leslie Hernandez. The two are sitting in one of Samuel Merritt\u2019s basement classrooms going over neuropharmacology.\n\nHernandez says she sees a lot of Latino students in nursing school with her, but it\u2019s not the same when she accompanies family members to the hospital or when she\u2019s at her clinical placements.\n\nShe remembers the moment when she realized the need for more Latinos \u2014 and Spanish-speaking \u2014 health care professionals. As one of her student placements, she was working in the psychiatric unit of a hospital. A patient had been deemed noncompliant by her doctors and nurses because she did not talk.\n\nBut Hernandez was able to communicate with the patient \u2014 in Spanish.\n\n\u201cShe was speaking in Spanish and she felt like nobody could understand her,\u201d Hernandez recounts.\n\nThe patient told Hernandez that she had suicidal thoughts, and Hernandez could pass that on to the doctor.\n\nAddressing Barriers Faced by Low-Income Students\n\nFinancial support is a major barrier for students of color. While lower-income students can take advantage of financial aid to cover tuition at either a public or private school, they can be derailed by smaller unexpected problems.\n\nA sudden need for hundreds of dollars for a car repair or an emergency dental problem can force students to drop out, diversity officer Strong says, adding that these students come from families that often don\u2019t have the resources to help in an emergency.\n\nTo help these students, Strong says Samuel Merritt is working to create a special fund, \u201cso that when a student has a problem we just write the check from the emergency fund, [so students can] stay attentive and on course to graduate.\u201d\n\nBut emergency finances and need for tutoring are the issues that black and Latino students face only after they get into nursing school. For so many others, nursing school isn\u2019t even an option.\n\nStrong says preparation for health care careers starts in high school \u2014 or sooner. \u201cThe key really is that they have to take science courses and the math courses early on, so when they get to college \u2026 they are prepared to step into these various programs.\u201d\n\nShe says if students don\u2019t have these courses, they spend a lot of time playing catch-up. Sometimes it\u2019s just too overwhelming to tackle.\n\nSamuel Merritt is partnering with pathway programs such as the Health Academy at Oakland Technical High School, and Berkeley High\u2019s B-Tech Academy. The goal of these schools is to give students who are interested in the health care field specialized instruction.\n\nThe Board of Registered Nursing forecasts that Latino population growth will continue to outpace the number of registered nurses and doctors unless more efforts are implemented to encourage enrollment and graduation of Latinos from RN programs.\n\nWhile African-Americans will be equally represented by 2030, they could be equally represented sooner if more African-American students are recruited to and graduate from RN programs.\n\nAs for Shanda Williams, she wants to open a clinic with some of her classmates.\n\n\u201cWorking in my community is what also helped keep me motivated in school,\u201d she says, adding that she thinks other students of color feel the same way. \u201cWe want to make changes in our communities that we have grown up (in) and that we have seen.\u201d\n\nShe wants patients like her grandmother to seek care from people who they trust, people who can say, \u201cI\u2019m from the same neighborhood you come from.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Thirty-nine percent of Californians are Hispanic, versus only 9 percent of nurses.
