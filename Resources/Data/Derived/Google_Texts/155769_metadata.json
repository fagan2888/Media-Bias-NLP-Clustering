That case is awaiting a ruling by the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, where it was argued in December.\n\nIn the latest ruling, the New Orleans-based 5th Circuit reversed Texas federal courts that had said the Religious Freedom Restoration Act protects the institutions from complying with the process by which they could avoid providing contraceptive coverage in health insurance. The lower courts had granted injunctions blocking the requirement for the organizations to file certain paperwork to qualify for an accommodation designed by the Department of Health and Human Services for faith-based entities that don't qualify for an automatic exemption.\n\nThe cases sought review of the preliminary and permanent injunctions granted to the institutions. Dozens of religious institutions around the country have received injunctions in lower courts preventing them from having to participate in the contraceptive mandate, while others have been denied injunctions.\n\nKnow a recent high school graduate?

In some of those cases, Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito ordered that the rulings by the circuit courts be stayed until the underlying legal challenges to the law can be heard, effectively reinstating the injunctions for the time being.\n\nThe organizations maintain that the act of having to file a form with their insurer or third-party insurance administrator or, instead, of sending a notice to HHS about the accommodation, implicate the organizations in actions that violate their religious belief that artificial contraceptives are immoral.\n\nWriting for a unanimous three-judge panel, Judge Jerry Smith said the steps required for the accommodation do no such thing.\n\n\"In short, the acts the plaintiffs are required to perform do not involve providing or facilitating access to contraceptives, and the plaintiffs have no right under RFRA to challenge the independent conduct of third parties\" which are responsible for all the actions and financing involved in the provision of contraceptives, Smith said.\n\nUnder HHS guidelines, religious organizations that qualify for exemption because they are pervasively religious in character, are not required to provide contraceptive coverage in employee health insurance. In the case of nonexempt institutions such as religious colleges and social service agencies, the accommodation guidelines provide for other entities to provide coverage to employees of accommodated organizations. The accommodated employers have no role in paying for, providing or managing coverage of contraceptives in health insurance.\n\nAs Smith explained, the accommodation is available to entities that first \"oppose, on religious grounds, providing coverage for some or all contraceptives; (2) it must be organized as a nonprofit; (3) it must hold itself out as religious; and (4) it must certify that it satisfies the foregoing criteria.\"\n\nSmith noted that religious institutions including dioceses and churches are automatically exempt from the requirement of the Affordable Care Act for all health insurance plans to cover contraceptives. The Beaumont and Fort Worth dioceses sued because entities that fall under their insurance plans -- Catholic Charities agencies and Our Lady of Victory Catholic School -- do not qualify for an exemption, but they do qualify for the accommodation, he said.\n\nHe said \"it is a misreading of the regulations\" to conclude that the dioceses under which the Catholic Charities agencies and the school operate must either sponsor an insurance plan that includes contraceptives or remove the entities from their insurance plans.\n\nSmith said that the accommodation does not burden the free exercise of religion, and therefore, \"neither does a requirement that the dioceses do nothing and the affiliated entities apply for the accommodation.\"\n\nThe ruling cited last year's Supreme Court decision in Hobby Lobby, in which the court held that closely held, for-profit organizations may qualify for religious exemption from the mandate for coverage of artificial birth control, sterilization and abortion-causing drugs.\n\nThat ruling relied, said Smith, on reaffirming \"that courts defer to the objector's description of his religious exercise upon finding that his beliefs are sincerely held and religious. And the court analyzed the substantiality of the penalties for noncompliance itself, rather than automatically accepting the corporations' position.\"\n\nBut, Smith said, the Hobby Lobby ruling said nothing about the legal question of whether the requirements of seeking an accommodation substantially burden religious exercise, which is the relevant issue in the cases he considered.\n\nIn these cases, Smith said, \"although the plaintiffs have identified several acts that offend their religious beliefs, the acts they are required to perform do not include providing or facilitating access to contraceptives. Instead, the acts that violate their faith are those of third parties. Because RFRA confers no right to challenge the independent conduct of third parties, we join our sister circuits in concluding that the plaintiffs have not shown a substantial burden on their religious exercise.\"\n\nThe institutions had sued HHS, the Labor and Treasury departments and their secretaries.", "article_metadata": {"Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=4, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5d1f\"", "article_summary": "Dozens of religious institutions around the country have received injunctions in lower courts preventing them from having to participate in the contraceptive mandate, while others have been denied injunctions.\nSmith said that the accommodation does not burden the free exercise of religion, and therefore, \"neither does a requirement that the dioceses do nothing and the affiliated entities apply for the accommodation.\"\nWriting for a unanimous three-judge panel, Judge Jerry Smith said the steps required for the accommodation do no such thing.\nThe accommodated employers have no role in paying for, providing or managing coverage of contraceptives in health insurance.\nThe case is similar to that of the Little Sisters of the Poor, which is challenging the same regulation and the process of accommodation."}
