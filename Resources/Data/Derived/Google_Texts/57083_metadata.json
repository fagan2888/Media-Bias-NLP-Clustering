At least, that\u2019s what every secessionist movement would have you believe. Enchanted by the opening lines of the Declaration of Independence, scores of small movements have found it necessary to dissolve political bonds with their state and federal legislatures, though none has successfully done so since the creation of West Virginia in 1863.\n\nThe hundreds of secessionist movements throughout U.S. history\u2014over 200 in California alone\u2014have mostly grown from the same root: a small, culturally homogenous, and usually conservative rural population that feels ignored, if not outright antagonized, by its big city legislature. This grievance sharpened in recent years as the ideological split over issues like gay marriage and especially gun control became geographically acute, and as vague anti-urban tendencies were focused by theories like Agenda 21, which see city planning policies as masks for fascistic attempts to confiscate resources and currencies.\n\nThe modern secessionist movements are very much of a piece with this history, with some crucial updates: their founders have morphed from hard-scrabble eccentrics to successful businessmen, and the printed declarations of separation have become Facebook pages and (woefully underfollowed) Twitter accounts. Below are five current secessionist movements currently kicking up dust in the overlooked section of their states.\n\n1. The 51st State Movement (Colorado). In a sign of the new secessionist movements, the 51st State non-profit is run by businessmen: President Thomas L. Gilley, CEO of a dry beans distributor (\u201cour beans speak for themselves\u201d) and Treasurer Jeffrey Hare, CEO for an IT security firm. The men boast of their Colorado and farmer roots, a twin legacy they see threatened by the encroaching liberalism of the rest of the state.\n\n\u201cPeople think this is a radical idea,\u201d Hare told the New York Times. \u201cIt\u2019s really not. What we\u2019re attempting to do is restore liberty.\u201d\n\nThe eleven rural counties of the 51st State have depopulated over the past two decades, and though unemployment is low thanks to healthy oil and agriculture markets, the counties receive few resources from Denver. The movement was fired up when Colorado considered a slew of gun control measures following the Aurora shootings last year. (Not surprisingly, they cheered last month\u2019s recall of two state legislators over the issue.)\n\nSave for the intro from the Declaration of Independence, their website is matter-of-fact and utilitarian: there\u2019s little anti-government invective, but plenty on how to get involved, and on the steps for legal separation: a ballot measure, then ratification by the state legislature and amendment of the state constitution, and then by Congress.\n\nCurrently, the 51st Movement remains something of a shot in the dark. The group\u2019s hopeful hashtag\u2014#51stStateInitiative\u2014 has exactly two mentions on Twitter. Hardly shocking for a rural movement, but not fortuitous for one that eventually demands recognition, either.\n\nBut that\u2019s not to say they\u2019re not having an impact. Democratic Governor John Hickenlooper has recently shown signs of being chastened by the backlash from more conservative elements of his state. \u201cThere are enough people that feel their views and their opinions aren\u2019t being considered that I think that\u2019s a serious problem,\u201d he said, showing that secessionist movements might, ironically, be better at affecting change within their legislators than at splitting from them.\n\n2. Texas Nationalist Movement (Texas). Ignore Rick Perry\u2019s infamous 2009 secessionist comment, which was taken out of context from a longer answer to the Associated Press dismissing secessionism.\n\nDo not ignore the Republic of Texas, a choleric organization that briefly flourished in the 1990s. The Republic was founded by Richard Lance McLaren, who declared Texas illegally seized by the U.S. government and demanded independence and eventually reparations to the tune of $93 trillion; he filed so many suits that the country clerk supposedly gave his cases their own cabinet. Incensed by the Branch Dividian conflagration in Waco, but also riven by internal disputes, the Republic ended with McLaren holding two hostages in stand-off with Texas authorities. He\u2019s currently in prison until 2041.\n\nThe Texas Nationalist Movement slowly grew out of the Republic of Texas, and claims to work within existing legal and political structures to achieve Texas independence. Like many secessionist movements, TNM argues that its state\u2019s annexation was illegitimate, giving its proposed separation a gossamer of legal rationale. It recently hosted the Come and Take It Festival, where it gathered signatures for a Let Texas Decide Petition that TNM hopes will make the ballot in 2014.\n\nThe group claims its membership soared both after Perry\u2019s comments and around the 2012 election\u2014it now claims over 250,000 members\u2014and its political presence was affirmed at the start of the 2013 legislative session, when the group scored a meeting with Lt. Governor David Dewhurst, and even got secession mentioned on the floor of the Texas House. \u201cOur economy is so vast and diverse that if Texas were its own country \u2014 and no, don\u2019t worry, that isn\u2019t something we\u2019re going to do this session \u2014 but if we were, we\u2019d be the 14th-largest economy in the world,\u201d boasted House Speaker Joe Straus.\n\n3. Alaska Independent Party (Alaska). \u201cAren\u2019t most Alaskan Independence Party members a bunch of radicals and kooks?\u201d It\u2019s a good question, especially as it was asked by the Alaskan Independence Party itself. \u201cThe party has its share of individualists, in the grand Alaskan tradition,\u201d A.I.P. responded. \u201cNo longer a fringe party, the A.I.P. is a viable third party with a serious mission and qualified candidates for elected offices.\u201d\n\nThat grand Alaskan tradition includes \u201cOld\u201d Joe Volger, the founder and charismatic authority of the A.I.P., who became politicized during the construction of the Trans-Alaska Oil Pipeline, declaring that \u201cthe United States has made a colony of Alaska.\u201d\n\nArguing that a U.N. charter guaranteed territories a vote on independence, something Alaska never technically held, Volger began a surprisingly successful campaign for political prominence, eventually getting Wally Hickel, Richard Nixon\u2019s interior secretary, elected governor under the A.I.P. ticket. Along the way, he made a name for himself as an eccentric player in Alaskan politics, once proposing during a gubernatorial debate to nuke the glaciers surrounding Juneau. (\u201cThere\u2019s gold under there!\u201d) And when he wanted the U.N. to recognize Alaska, he sidled up to the only nation willing to sponsor it\u2014the Republic of Iran. Volger was murdered by another secessionist before the recognition could take place.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Each is composed of a rural population that feels ignored, if not outright antagonized, by its big city legislature", "title": "5 far-right groups trying to secede from America", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Each is composed of a rural population that feels ignored, if not outright antagonized, by its big city legislature", "title": "5 far-right groups trying to secede from America", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/10/12/five_different_culturally_homogenous_secessionist_movements_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2012/05/confederate_flag_rect.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Each is composed of a rural population that feels ignored, if not outright antagonized, by its big city legislature", "title": "5 far-right groups trying to secede from America", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2012/05/confederate_flag_rect.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Evan McMurry", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, AlterNet, America, Far-right, Patriotism, secession, secessionist movement", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdfca\"", "article_summary": "\u201cAren\u2019t most Alaskan Independence Party members a bunch of radicals and kooks?\u201d It\u2019s a good question, especially as it was asked by the Alaskan Independence Party itself.\nTopics: AlterNet, America, Far-right, Patriotism, secession, secessionist movement, Social News, Life News, Politics NewsThis article originally appeared on AlternetThere\u2019s nothing more American than seceding.\nTexas Nationalist Movement (Texas).\nBelow are five current secessionist movements currently kicking up dust in the overlooked section of their states.\nLike many secessionist movements, TNM argues that its state\u2019s annexation was illegitimate, giving its proposed separation a gossamer of legal rationale."}
