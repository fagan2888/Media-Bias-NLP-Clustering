His concerns stem from a story the Los Angeles Times published on Thursday citing a recent study in Oregon.\n\nCourtesy of Senator Ted Lieu\n\nAccording to Lieu, \u201cA recent study in the journal Science shows that Medicaid expansion increases emergency room visits of Medicaid enrollees by 40 percent. California is already dead last in the nation in terms of ER capacity. ER overcrowding, which is already at crisis levels, will only get worse with California's Medicaid expansion unless changes are made.\u201c\n\n\u201cI thus call on California hospitals to immediately and voluntarily adopt the National Emergency Department Overcrowding Score (NEDOCS) methodology, or other similar protocols, to reduce ER wait times.\u201d In 2012, Lieu authored Senate Bill 336, which was meant to do exactly that but it did not become law.\n\nAccording to Lieu, the California Hospital Association did not oppose SB 336 and it was supported by the American College of Emergency Physicians (California Chapter) and the California Medical Association. Currently, some California hospitals have adopted NEDOCS and found the protocols to reduce ER overcrowding significantly by reducing \u201cboarding\u201d where stabilized patients are kept in ER.\n\n\u201cI will continue to pursue this issue, but in the meantime, there is no time to waste,\u201d Lieu said. \u201cThe Affordable Care Act is being implemented and Medicaid expansion is happening. California's ER overcrowding problem will soon start causing even more unnecessary deaths unless more efficient protocols are put into place.\u201d\n\n\u201cER overcrowding is a problem that can affect anyone. Whether you are a CEO or a homeless person, if you have a life-threatening emergency and your ambulance has to be diverted to another hospital farther away because of ER overcrowding, your chances of death just increased. The time is now to take steps to reduce future unnecessary deaths from ER overcrowding,\u201d Lieu concluded.\n\nLieu represents the 28th Senate district, which includes the cities of Beverly Hills, Carson, El Segundo, Hermosa Beach, Lomita, Manhattan Beach, Redondo Beach, Santa Monica, Torrance, West Hollywood and the Palos Verdes Peninsula.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In a press release issued today, Senator Ted Lieu (D-Redondo Beach) calls on California hospitals to reduce emergency room wait times by adopting national guide", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Examiner.com", "description": "The practice of using emergency rooms to seek treatment for non-urgent issues has become so common for some, the medical profession has a name for them \u2013 \u2018superusers\u2019.", "title": "Sen.
