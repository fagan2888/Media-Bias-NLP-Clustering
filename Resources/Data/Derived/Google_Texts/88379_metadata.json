Luke Messer (R-Ind.) has introduced legislation that would terminate lawmakers' salaries if Congress doesn't pass a budget that balances within ten years.\n\nMembers of Congress would stop receiving their paychecks if they don't approve a budget that eliminates the deficit within a decade by April 15 of each year.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMesser, who chairs the House Republican Policy Committee, said the threat of losing their pay would motivate lawmakers to approve a budget on time.\n\n\u201cIt is past time for the federal government do what families all across this country do every day: live within our means and balance our budget,\u201d Messer said in a statement. \u201cThis bill requiring a balanced budget or no pay for members will help do that.\n\nSen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.) has introduced companion legislation in the Senate.\n\n\u201cThe American people deserve a balanced budget. Unfortunately, Washington remains unwilling to take the steps needed to get our country back on solid fiscal ground,\u201d Daines said.\n\nIn 2013, Congress included a measure known as \"No Budget, No Pay\" in a suspension of the debt limit that required lawmakers to pass a budget on time or else lose their pay. However, the law only applied to that year and did not specify a required timeframe for eradicating the federal deficit. Congress has not approved a similar provision in subsequent debt limit increases since then.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The measure would terminate lawmakers' salaries if Congress doesn't pass a budget that balances within ten years.", "description": "The measure would terminate lawmakers' salaries if Congress doesn't pass a budget that balances within ten years.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Floor Action"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The measure would terminate lawmakers' salaries if Congress doesn't pass a budget that balances within ten years.", "title": "Bill would cut lawmakers' pay if Congress doesn't pass a 'balanced' budget", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/232975-bill-would-cut-lawmakers-pay-if-congress-doesnt-pass-a-balanced", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-02-17T14:08:49-05:00", "type": "article"}, "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2015-02-17T14:08-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/232975-bill-would-cut-lawmakers-pay-if-congress-doesnt-pass-a-balanced", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2015-02-17T13:54-05:00", "dcterms.creator": "Cristina Marcos", "author": "Cristina Marcos", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"published_time": "2015-02-17T13:54:28-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-17T14:08:49-05:00"}, "keywords": "No Budget No Pay,Luke Messer, Steve Daines,", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/232975-bill-would-cut-lawmakers-pay-if-congress-doesnt-pass-a-balanced", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The measure would terminate lawmakers' salaries if Congress doesn't pass a budget that balances within ten years.", "card": "summary", "title": "Bill would cut lawmakers' pay if Congress doesn't pass a 'balanced' budget"}, "dcterms.title": "Bill would cut lawmakers' pay if Congress doesn't pass a 'balanced' budget"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0629\"", "article_summary": "has introduced legislation that would terminate lawmakers' salaries if Congress doesn't pass a budget that balances within ten years.\nIn 2013, Congress included a measure known as \"No Budget, No Pay\" in a suspension of the debt limit that required lawmakers to pass a budget on time or else lose their pay.\n\u201cThis bill requiring a balanced budget or no pay for members will help do that.\n\u201cIt is past time for the federal government do what families all across this country do every day: live within our means and balance our budget,\u201d Messer said in a statement.\nADVERTISEMENTMesser, who chairs the House Republican Policy Committee, said the threat of losing their pay would motivate lawmakers to approve a budget on time."}
