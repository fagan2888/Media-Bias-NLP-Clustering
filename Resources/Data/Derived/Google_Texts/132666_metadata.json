About an inch of rain fell at the Upper Williams Canyon weather station above Manitou Springs, causing high water flows downstream.\n\nAdditional rain showers are expected in the area throughout the day.\n\nKieran Nicholson: 303-954-1822, knicholson@denverpost.com or twitter.com/kierannicholson", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Manitou Springs deals with morning rain, flooding", "title": "Manitou Springs deals with morning rain, flooding", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/09/11/manitou-springs-deals-with-morning-rain-flooding/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130810__manitou-floodingp1.jpg", "height": 399}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130810__manitou-floodingp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-11T08:53:13+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T16:58:13+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Residents of Manitou Springs and surrounding areas were on alert Wednesday morning as rain swelled creeks in the area and created a risk of flooding.\nAbout an inch of rain fell at the Upper Williams Canyon weather station above Manitou Springs, causing high water flows downstream.\nRain fell in the Waldo Canyon fire scar area Wednesday morning and in surrounding areas, according to the weather service.\nManitou Creek ran high and fast and the water was brown with fire scar sediment, said Marcy Morrison, who heads the Manitou Springs Chamber of Commerce.\n\u201cThere\u2019s been some pretty heavy rain,\u201d Morrison said."}
