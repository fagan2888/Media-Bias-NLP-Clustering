Hill recommended the stock along with Cerner and Allscripts Healthcare Solutions Inc. /quotes/zigman/85021/delayed /quotes/nls/mdrx MDRX , which gained more than 3% to $14.72. Cerner was up more than 2% to $57.20.\n\n\u201cWe believe successful [health-care info tech] vendors will enable the transformation of the healthcare industry to a more dynamic value oriented environment from its legacy fee-for-service structure,\u201d Hill said. \u201cThe leading vendors in the [health-care info tech] space could have a decade or more of above market revenue and comfortable double digit earnings growth rates ahead of them.\u201d\n\nAlthough McKesson plays in the health-care info tech space, the lion\u2019s share of its revenue comes from pharmaceutical distribution. It\u2019s there that Hill sees a sector transforming into a global model from a regional strategy.\n\n\u201cThis scale matters most in several areas, with generic procurement being the most important. This will prove to be a scale business, where the high quality, low cost providers of service on at the largest scale will be best positioned to benefit,\u201d he wrote in a note to clients.\n\nHill\u2019s top picks were McKesson and Walgreen, though he did give a buy rating to Rite Aid Corp. /quotes/zigman/239690/delayed /quotes/nls/rad RAD McKesson added more than 1% to $160.63, Walgreen was up a similar percentage to $60.28 and Rite Aid was up nearly 3% to $5.24.\n\nFollow Russ Britt on Twitter @russbrittmktw\n\nFollow Health Exchange on Twitter @MWHealthBlog", "article_metadata": {"article.created": "2013-11-21T11:41:19-05:00", "application-name": "MarketWatch.com", "twitter": {"domain": "Marketwatch.com", "description": "A number of pharmaceutical distributors and health-care information technology companies get a lift when Deutsche Bank initiates coverage on a number of firms in both sectors, rating many as \"buy.\"", "title": "Drug distributors, health-tech firms feel the love from Deutsche Bank", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2013/11/21/drug-distributors-health-tech-firms-feel-the-love-from-deutsche-bank/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BP634_doctor_MG_20131121111932.jpg"}, "site": "MarketWatch", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.author": "Russ Britt", "article.section": "Markets", "keywords": "AthenaHealth Inc.,Deutsche Bank ratings,Health-care information technology,McKesson Corp.,Pharmacy distributors", "article.headline": "Drug distributors, health-tech firms feel the love from Deutsche Bank", "msapplication-task": "name=SmartMoney;action-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/;icon-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/favicon.ico", "news_keywords": "AthenaHealth Inc.,Deutsche Bank ratings,Health-care information technology,McKesson Corp.,Pharmacy distributors", "author": "Russ Britt", "article.page": "Health Exchange Blog", "description": "A number of pharmaceutical distributors and health-care information technology companies get a lift when Deutsche Bank initiates coverage on a number of firms in both sectors, rating many as \"buy.\"", "article.published": "2013-11-21T11:41:19-05:00", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "msapplication-tooltip": "MarketWatch", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2013/11/21/drug-distributors-health-tech-firms-feel-the-love-from-deutsche-bank/", "app_id": 283204329838}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch", "image_count": 2}, "og": {"site_name": "Marketwatch", "description": "A number of pharmaceutical distributors and health-care information technology companies get a lift when Deutsche Bank initiates coverage on a number of firms in both sectors, rating many as \"buy.\"", "title": "Drug distributors, health-tech firms feel the love from Deutsche Bank", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2013/11/21/drug-distributors-health-tech-firms-feel-the-love-from-deutsche-bank/", "image": {"width": 569, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BP634_doctor_MG_20131121111932.jpg", "height": 398}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Health Exchange", "article.id": "BL-MW243B-1602", "article.updated": "2013-11-21T11:41:19-05:00"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWe believe successful [health-care info tech] vendors will enable the transformation of the healthcare industry to a more dynamic value oriented environment from its legacy fee-for-service structure,\u201d Hill said.\nHill recommended the stock along with Cerner and Allscripts Healthcare Solutions Inc. /quotes/zigman/85021/delayed /quotes/nls/mdrx MDRX , which gained more than 3% to $14.72.\nShutterstockThe biggest climber was AthenaHealth, which jumped more than 4% to $131.13, up $5.40 a share.\nIt\u2019s there that Hill sees a sector transforming into a global model from a regional strategy.\n\u201cThe leading vendors in the [health-care info tech] space could have a decade or more of above market revenue and comfortable double digit earnings growth rates ahead of them.\u201dAlthough McKesson plays in the health-care info tech space, the lion\u2019s share of its revenue comes from pharmaceutical distribution."}
