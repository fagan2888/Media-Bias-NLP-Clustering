I didn\u2019t want to be in something gender-neutral,\u201d Perry told the Post-Dispatch. \u201cI am a girl. I am not going to be pushed away to another bathroom.\u201d\n\nPerry was granted permission to use the girls\u2019 restrooms and began doing so when classes started last month.\n\nAccording to The New York Times, over 100 students left class on Monday to protest.\n\nStudents and parents who gathered expressed concern over female students\u2019 safety and privacy.\n\nCounter-protesters gathered in support of Perry as well, the Post-Dispatch reported.\n\nThe Daily Signal previously reported that Perry\u2019s school district, the Hillsboro R-3 School District, allows transgender students to use facilities designated for the opposite sex. Alliance Defending Freedom sent a letter to the district proposing an alternative policy.\n\nADF legal counsel Matt Sharp told The Daily Signal in an interview that \u201cthe law is very clear that schools can maintain separate facilities\u2014including locker rooms and bathrooms\u2014based on sex.\u201d\n\nSharp said \u201ccommon sense shouldn\u2019t be thrown out the window.\u201d\n\nHe suggested that schools provide single-stall bathrooms and individual changing areas for students who request accommodation, which would protect the \u201cprivacy and dignity\u201d of every student.\n\nSome who opposed the decision noted that Perry has not yet undergone gender-reassignment surgery.\n\n\u201cThe way I was raised, I have no problem with a transgender, but he shouldn\u2019t be in the women\u2019s locker room until he has the surgery,\u201d Greg Wilson, a parent in the school district, told the Leader.\n\nSome students were supportive of Perry\u2019s choice to use the girls\u2019 restroom.\n\n\u201cShe is such a good person,\u201d Skyla Thompson, who described herself as Perry\u2019s best friend, told the Post-Dispatch. \u201cThey are just judging her on the outside.\u201d\n\nThe Missouri Gay-Straight Alliance Network is planning a rally in support of Perry.\n\n\u201cWe are here to show Lila and other trans students around the state of Missouri and around the county that we lift them up when others might try to bring them down,\u201d said a post on the group\u2019s Facebook page for the event.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"The law is very clear that schools can maintain separate facilities based on sex.\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\"The law is very clear that schools can maintain separate facilities based on sex.\u201d", "title": "Protests at School Over Transgender Student Using Girls\u2019 Bathroom", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150902_Hillsboro_Scanlon.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-09-02T23:14:07+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1IKPhfA"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\"The law is very clear that schools can maintain separate facilities based on sex.\u201d", "title": "Protests at School Over Transgender Student Using Girls\u2019 Bathroom", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150902_Hillsboro_Scanlon.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Education", "tag": "k-12", "published_time": "2015-09-02T17:52:05+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-02T23:14:07+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "School, Education, Hillsboro School district, bathrooms, bathroom policy, Lila Perry, transgender, transgender students"}, "article_summary": "The Daily Signal previously reported that Perry\u2019s school district, the Hillsboro R-3 School District, allows transgender students to use facilities designated for the opposite sex.\nProtests erupted at a Missouri high school on Monday after a transgender student requested permission to use the girls\u2019 restroom.\nThe St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports that Lila Perry, a transgender senior at Hillsboro High School, asked for permission from the school to use bathrooms and locker rooms designated for female students.\nI didn\u2019t want to be in something gender-neutral,\u201d Perry told the Post-Dispatch.\n\u201cThe way I was raised, I have no problem with a transgender, but he shouldn\u2019t be in the women\u2019s locker room until he has the surgery,\u201d Greg Wilson, a parent in the school district, told the Leader."}
