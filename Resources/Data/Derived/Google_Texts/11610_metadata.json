In its effort to manage the pain during the Republican primary race, the party prescribed many generic pain remedies:\n\nAnalgesics: Marco Rubio, easy on the stomach but largely ineffective for such a large wound.\n\nSleeping pills: Ben Carson, who put more Americans to sleep over six months than Ambien.\n\nBeta-blockers: Ted Cruz, the tea party favorite who made a name for himself by blocking everything. As it turned out, he beta-blocked himself right out of the race. The Republican body rejected him.\n\nStem cell therapy (non-fetal): Jeb Bush. The idea was to use the genetic stem cells from a successful earlier iteration of the Republican Party. Unfortunately, this type of medical procedure is not covered under ObamaCare. The stem cells devoured themselves and eventually devoured Bush.\n\nOpioids: Donald Trump, the Oxycontin, morphine drip and Fentanyl patch all rolled into one. He is the feelings-deadening cocktail that one administers when all is lost. This kind of treatment is frequently used as part of hospice care. With Donald Trump offered to mitigate the effects of Obamaitis, we might be witnessing the death of the Republican Party. It will not be a death with dignity.\n\nGregory Schmidt\n\nBethel Park", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Letter to the Editor", "description": "The Republican Party is hurting and its leadership diagnosed the cause of the pain as Obamaitis \u2014 an inflammation and infection of the American economic ...", "pubdate": "2016-05-18 21:00:02", "author": "Letter to the Editor", "og": {"site_name": "TribLIVE.com", "description": "The Republican Party is hurting and its leadership diagnosed the cause of the pain as Obamaitis \u2014 an inflammation and infection of the American economic ...", "title": "Trump's narcotic effect", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://triblive.com/csp/mediapool/sites/TribLIVE/assets2/img/logos/triblive/TribLIVELogo.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-05-18 21:00:02.437", "url": "http://triblive.com/opinion/letters/10479145-74/party-republican-trump", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Republican Party is hurting and its leadership diagnosed the cause of the pain as Obamaitis \u2014 an inflammation and infection of the American economic ...", "creator": "@triblive", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "tribbird://", "iphone": "tribbird://"}, "name": {"ipad": "TribLIVE News and Sports", "iphone": "TribLIVE News and Sports"}, "id": {"ipad": 328217517, "iphone": 328217517}}, "title": "Trump's narcotic effect", "site": {"identifier": "@triblive", "id": 20269833}, "image": "http://triblive.com/csp/mediapool/sites/TribLIVE/assets2/img/logos/triblive/TribLIVETwitter.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2016-05-18 21:00:02", "fb": {"app_id": 144410955752326}, "sailthru.title": "Trump's narcotic effect", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=328217517", "sailthru.canonical": "http://triblive.com/opinion/letters/10479145-74/party-republican-trump", "keywords": "party, republican, trump, pain, stem", "headline": "Trump's narcotic effect", "sailthru.tags": "Newsletter, Opinion, Letters (Allegheny)", "article": {"category": "Opinion", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/triblive", "published_time": "2016-05-18 21:00:02", "subcategory": "Letters", "mainsection": "Opinion", "section": "Opinion", "publishedtoweb": "2016-05-18 21:00:02", "modified_time": "2016-05-18 21:00:02.437", "tag": "party, republican, trump, pain, stem", "subsection": "Letters", "title": "Trump's narcotic effect", "author": "Letter to the Editor"}, "docauthor": "Letter to the Editor", "sailthru.description": "The Republican Party is hurting and its leadership diagnosed the cause of the pain as Obamaitis \u2014 an inflammation and infection of the American economic ..."}, "article_summary": "Trump's narcotic effectEmail Newsletters Sign up for one of our email newsletters.\nWith Donald Trump offered to mitigate the effects of Obamaitis, we might be witnessing the death of the Republican Party.\nOpioids: Donald Trump, the Oxycontin, morphine drip and Fentanyl patch all rolled into one.\nThe idea was to use the genetic stem cells from a successful earlier iteration of the Republican Party.\nThe stem cells devoured themselves and eventually devoured Bush."}
