At the second Democratic debate, Bernie Sanders was fielding a question about the Affordable Care Act. He described it as a step in the right direction, but added that as a nation we must go further.

In doing so, he made clear that there's only one candidate on stage with a plan to provide universal health care to all citizens.

Bernie Sanders: "I want to end the international embarrassment of the United States of America being the only major country on earth that doesn't guarantee health care to all people as a right and not a privilege."

This wasn't the first time that Senator Sanders stood up for universal health care.
