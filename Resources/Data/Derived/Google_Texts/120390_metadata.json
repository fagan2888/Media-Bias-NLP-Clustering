As the handcuffs were being tightened on his wrists, he calmly told Chief Peoria County Judge Steve Kouri that he wanted to appeal. In fact, considering the sentence, Thomas reacted almost like he expected the sentence and wasn\u2019t too concerned about it.\n\nInstead, Thomas told Kouri, as he has throughout his case, that he planned to appeal nearly every facet of the proceedings, going so far as to say, \u201cI want the appellate court to know that if I forgot to mention something, I object to that as well.\u201d\n\nBut Kouri flatly denied Thomas\u2019 18-page motion for a new trial and then, later in the hearing, handed down the life term.\n\n\u201cIf ever there was a person who deserved a life sentence, it is you, Mr. Thomas,\u201d the judge said.\n\nThomas was convicted a second time last November of stabbing his wife, Martha, 38 times on Jan. 20, 2010, while the two were in a car on Adams Street, just north of Downtown Peoria. Two small children, one 5 years old and one an infant, were in the back seat at the time.\n\nJurors found that Thomas acted in a \u201cbrutal and heinous matter indicative of wanton cruelty,\u201d legalese that opened the door for a possible life sentence.\n\nHe initially was convicted and then sentenced in 2011. That was nullified when a trio of appellate judges found in May 2013 the judge should have allowed Thomas to act as his own attorney, even if that request came on the day of trial.\n\nOn the day his original trial was to begin, Thomas said he wanted to represent himself because he was upset with his public defender, who he said didn\u2019t visit him enough or wasn\u2019t willing to present the evidence he wanted. Thomas wanted to present evidence of an income tax conspiracy, which he believed would explain his actions that day.\n\nDuring his second trial, angered by what he perceived to be bias against him by prosecutors and Kouri, he refused to participate in the first day of the trial and then declined to give an opening statement or testify in his own defense during the two-day trial.\n\nAndy Kravetz can be reached at 686-3283 and akravetz@pjstar.com.
