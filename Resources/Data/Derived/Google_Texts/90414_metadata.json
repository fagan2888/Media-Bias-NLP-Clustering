It was passed by the Senate on Saturday evening, 56-40.)\n\nLast Sunday, Rebecca Shabad reported for The Hill that good government groups were \u201cbracing for surprises in the massive government-funding bill\u201d that must be passed this week in order to avoid a government shutdown. K Street lobbyists were drooling over the $1 trillion dollar budget authorization, and saw it as \u201ca final chance\u2026 to find a vehicle for their priorities.\u201d\n\nNow we know what some of those \u201csurprises\u201d are.\n\nThe provision that\u2019s drawn the most criticism is a measure that would weaken the already watered-down Dodd-Frank financial reforms passed in the wake of the 2008 financial meltdown.\n\nIt\u2019s a proposal that, according to The New York Times, was essentially written by lobbyists for Citigroup and targets a central provision of Dodd-Frank that limits taxpayers\u2019 exposure by requiring banks to isolate some of their riskiest bets in business units that aren\u2019t insured by the federal government. The idea was to try to prevent Wall Street from making the kind of reckless trades that fueled the last crisis.\n\nA lot of Republicans favor repealing the rule outright, so the provision is seen by many as a compromise \u2014 instead of killing the regulation completely, it would significantly expand the kinds of derivatives that are exempt from the rule. This is an example of big financial firms trying to socialize their risk.\n\nBut at The Wall Street Journal, David Reilly argues that \u201cbecause banks have chosen to try and slide this through the legislative back door,\u201d the amendment would \u201creinforce the notion among the public that Wall Street can\u2019t be trusted and will always try to rig the game in its own favor.\u201d As such, \u201cthe long-term cost of perpetuating that perception may well outweigh any short-term gains banks reap from this legislative maneuver.\u201d\n\nAnother proposal would undermine what\u2019s left of limits on campaign donations. According to Politico, it would increase the maximum amount a single wealthy donor could give to the Republican or Democratic parties and their congressional campaign committees from $97,200 to as much as $777,600.\n\nGreg Sargent reports for The Washington Post that \u201cin a little detail that doesn\u2019t reflect particularly well on Congress, no one knows how this measure got into the bill.\u201d\n\nBut, really, there\u2019s no mystery here: The party committees \u2014 Democratic ones included \u2014 will tacitly support this measure, without saying so out loud, because it will, you know, allow them to raise a lot more money.\n\nPension fund trustees \u2014 both from unions and employers \u2014 pushed another provision into the bill that would allow some funds to make steep cuts to the benefits of current retirees, reversing 40 years of federal law. The rider could threaten the retirement security of up to 1.5 million middle-class workers, Michael Hiltzik writes in the Los Angeles Times.\n\nAnother rider reportedly was slipped into the bill by Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) \u201cat the behest of trucking industry groups.\u201d It would endanger public safety by easing restrictions on how many hours truckers can spend behind the wheel \u2014 even though driver fatigue is believed to be a leading cause of crashes. [UPDATE: After publication, Sen. Collins\u2019 office reached out to BillMoyers.com to object to The Hill newspaper\u2019s characterization that the trucking measure \u201cwas slipped into the bill,\u201d which we quoted above. A spokesman says, \u201cThe provision was debated in the Senate Appropriations Committee in June 2014, and by a bipartisan vote of 21-9, it was approved and included in the Senate Transportation Appropriations bill.\u201d However, the Senate Transportation Appropriations bill was defeated in the House in July. The Senate later passed a House version of the bill, which did not contain the provision. It subsequently reappeared, pushed by Senator Collins, as a rider in the spending bill, a move that Dorothy Samuels, writing in The New York Times on Tuesday, described as \u201cegregious\u201d and \u201can atrocious giveaway.\u201d]\n\nNegotiators have reportedly battled back and forth over an array of riders that would undermine the regulatory powers of the Environmental Protection Agency. The final draft contains a measure that would exempt big agricultural operations from clean water rules. The agency\u2019s overall budget was also cut by $60 million compared to last year\u2019s budget. According to The Washington Post, the EPA\u2019s \u201cbudget has been slashed by $2.2 billion, or 21 percent, since fiscal 2010,\u201d and \u201cthe cuts mean that EPA will have to reduce its staffing to the lowest levels since 1989.\u201d\n\nThere are other cuts \u2014 to the IRS and the Affordable Care Act \u2014 and various partisan games like defunding Michelle Obama\u2019s healthy school lunch initiative and freezing the salaries of Vice President Joe Biden and \u201csenior political appointees.\u201d It defunds ACORN, the low-income community organization that hasn\u2019t existed since 2010. A notably cruel amendment would block the use of tax dollars to cover abortions for women housed in federal prisons.\n\nThis is a fluid story \u2014 it\u2019s unknown what will remain in the final bill, or if a bill can be finalized. If the bill can\u2019t pass, Republicans say they\u2019ll offer a short-term funding bill that kicks the battle down the road until February, at which point, with a majority in both the House and Senate, they\u2019ll have a stronger position.\n\nOne thing that\u2019s clear is that this fight will shape how Congress functions over the next two years. One senior Republican staffer told The Hill, \u201cIf liberal Democrats vote for this package it shows that conservatives can use must-pass legislation to repeal the regulatory state.\u201d He urged GOP leaders, the congressional newspaper reported, to \u201cuse the tactic to begin chipping away at other Democratic laws, including ObamaCare.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "K Street has been salivating over a $1 trillion spending bill that will keep the government open.
