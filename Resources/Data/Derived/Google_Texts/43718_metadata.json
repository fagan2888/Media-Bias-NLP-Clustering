It could be in the future that we\u2019ll discover he fits all of them, or it could be someone else. But I\u2019m telling you there are many characteristics that he displays.\u201d\n\nIt would appear that he\u2019s given those characteristics a bit of thought, because he launched into a lengthy description of the biblical figure that closely matches some of the most feverish characterizations of the president.\n\n\u201cSatan coming to the earth in the form of humanity, many Bible scholars have, of course, equated that with an anti-Christ figure or Satan indwelling a man in the last days who\u2019s given this, these supernatural powers of deceiving the world and everything he says is a lie but people believe it and truth is thrown to the ground,\u201d Gallups says, pausing for breath. \u201cThe scripture tells us that he causes astounding devastation wherever he goes and attacks Christians and Jews in the final days and actually brings down all manner of tribulation. Yeah, the anti-Christ.\u201d\n\nEarlier in the program, Gallups suggested that the Affordable Care Act had proven his and Roth\u2019s prior warnings about Obama\u2019s destructive nature because it would ultimately destroy the Democratic Party along with public health.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not lying to you, we\u2019re not tricking you,\u201d Gallups said with a chuckle. \u201cThis man is evil. He\u2019s surrounded by evil people, he has evil designs for this nation, and again, we were called racists and conspiracy theorists and tinfoil hat (wearers).\u201d\n\nBut he said more Americans had started to agree with his dire warnings now that as many as 100 million people had suffered under Obamacare, although Gallups warned that he was still subject to unfair attacks for his beliefs.\n\n\u201cThere are people who are, especially those who are in the tank for Obama and those that want to lampoon anything a Christian says, who have jumped all over this,\u201d Gallups said.\n\nBut he said those critics were wrong, because Obama\u2019s not the only president he\u2019s speculated could be the anti-Christ.\n\nGallups said he previously wondered in sermons and during Bible study sessions whether former president George W. Bush could be Satan in human form, although those speculations weren\u2019t dispersed across the Internet.\n\n\u201cThe Bible says there will be an anti-Christ, right?\u201d Gallups said. \u201cSo one day, in some generation, there is going to be an anti-Christ. The Bible also says that we are to be watchful, we are to be mindful, we are to know the season in which we live, so it\u2019s my job (to speculate), and I don\u2019t care if people like it or not, Dr. Laurie.\u201d\n\nWatch this video posted online by Paul Simmons:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"width": 800, "height": 430}, "title": "Is Obama the anti-Christ?
