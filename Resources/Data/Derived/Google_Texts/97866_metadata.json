Tim Adelman, an attorney and certified flight instructor, leads the group from LeClairRyan\u2019s Annapolis, Md., office.\n\nAdelman said he\u2019s been working with clients with UAS legal concerns \u2013 both in the public and private sectors \u2014 since 2006.\n\n\u201cPrivacy has become a hot button issue with unmanned aircraft,\u201d he said.\n\nNiche practice groups are common for law firms seeking to capitalize on emerging industries and issues. Two lawyers at Thompson McMullan, for example, launched a practice in 2012 to focus on the growing brewery industry in the state. Other firms have recently formed groups to focus on the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Affordable Care Act.\n\nQuestions about drones and their use in the business world came up late last year when Amazon revealed its hopes to use them to deliver packages in the not-so-distant future.\n\nBut Adelman said the concept is too complicated for current technology. And there\u2019s a lot to be worked out with FAA regulations.\n\n\u201cThe FAA defines them as aircraft,\u201d he explained. That definition applies even if the drone is only sent up 100 feet from the ground.\n\nAdelman said drones aren\u2019t being used much in the Richmond area. But three hours west, Virginia Tech is part of a group that was selected by the FAA as one of six test sites to research how to integrate drones into the national airspace.\n\nJon Greene, interim executive director of the Mid-Atlantic Aviation Partnership, leads the group at Virginia Tech.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re right on the cutting edge of a new business,\u201d he said. \u201cThe challenge of integrating unmanned aircraft into the airspace in a responsible manner \u2013 it\u2019s a very interesting task.\u201d\n\nGreene said he hadn\u2019t heard of any law firms getting involved in UAS issues, although he\u2019s been contacted by some insurance companies with interest.\n\n\u201cThere are some interesting liability issues. If an unmanned aircraft has an accident, who is liable for it?\u201d Greene said. \u201cPrivacy is something that had a whole lot of attention last year. How do we make sure these things are operated responsibly?\u201d\n\nGreene said he foresees that drones will be used in coming years to support agriculture, emergency response, and agriculture.\n\nGreene said Virginia Commonwealth University and the University of Virginia, along with NASA, have also used drones in Virginia for research.\n\nGreene said Virginia Tech is looking for uninhabited areas to test drones. Some testing has already been done on a farm\n\nnear the university, in Canada and at Fort Pickett.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of things we\u2019ve got to figure out before we start flying these things around,\u201d he said.\n\nUnmanned Aircraft Systems don\u2019t come cheap. Adelman said a simple system might cost a couple thousand dollars while a more complex one could run anywhere from $100,000 to more than a million.\n\nLeClairRyan was founded in Richmond and has 63 attorneys here, the company said. It has two Richmond offices, one on East Franklin Street and another in Riverfront Plaza on East Byrd Street. The firm has about 350 attorneys in offices across the country.\n\nThe firm has been in growth mode over the past few years, tacking on teams of attorneys and entire firms.\n\nOn Jan. 1, it added 10 attorneys to its Newark office from a nearby firm.\n\nIn October 2013, it absorbed Annapolis-based Adelman, Sheff & Smith.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "leclairryan", "og": {"site_name": "Richmond BizSense", "description": "The newest practice group at one of Richmond\u2019s biggest law firms has its eye on the sky.", "title": "Law firm launches drone specialty", "url": "http://richmondbizsense.com/2014/03/05/law-firm-launches-drone-specialty/", "image": {"width": 620, "identifier": "http://richmondbizsense.com/images/DroneFeatured.jpg", "height": 342}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://richmondbizsense.com/images/DroneFeatured.jpg?w=640", "site": "@rvabizsense", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "The newest practice group at one of Richmond\u2019s biggest law firms has its eye on the sky.", "article": {"published_time": "2014-03-05T12:05:23-07:00", "modified_time": "2014-03-05T12:05:23-07:00"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfd72\"", "article_summary": "Law firm launches drone specialty Brandy BrubakerThe newest practice group at one of Richmond\u2019s biggest law firms has its eye on the sky.\nNiche practice groups are common for law firms seeking to capitalize on emerging industries and issues.\n\u201cPrivacy has become a hot button issue with unmanned aircraft,\u201d he said.\nLeClairRyan recently launched a group that specializes in legal issues involving Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) \u2013 more commonly known as drones.\nIf an unmanned aircraft has an accident, who is liable for it?\u201d Greene said."}
