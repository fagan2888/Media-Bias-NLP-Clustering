Individual freedom, the ability to make one\u2019s own choices without federal intervention, is a constant rallying cry. Why then is Republican Congressman John Fleming of Louisiana now looking to the federal government to block veteran\u2019s access to a drug that has been seen to relieve PTSD and Depression?\n\nOh, because that drug is medical marijuana.\n\nSpeaking on the House Floor last week, Rep. Fleming went after veteran administration doctors and their freedom to make the medically necessary decisions they feel are best for their patients. \u201cAs a practicing physician and a veteran myself, the way we approach health care is not to just allow any healthcare provider to do whatever he or she wants to do at the time.\u201d He said. \u201cThat is simply not the way health care works.\u201d\n\nThis is a change in narrative from the congressman, who\u2019s biggest claim to fame thus far has been his fight against Obamacare. Specifically, he railed against the perceived lack of patient and provider choice under the legislation.\n\nSponsoring one of many attempts to repeal the law in 2013, the congressman stated, \u201cWe want to bring consumer choice back into health care.\u201d Last February, he sponsored another vote that he\u2019d hoped would be \u201cthe first step toward restoring real choice to people\u2019s health care.\u201d\n\nIt seems that Congressman Fleming, like many of his ilk, only likes \u201cchoice\u201d when it fits his current narrative. If healthcare providers want to jack up prices, and only cover conditions they feel like covering, choice in healthcare is his friend. When it comes to the rights of veterans and their doctors to choose a treatment that involves medical marijuana, choice isn\u2019t even on his radar.\n\n[moko_youtube src=\u201d-DP4DCAuf4E\u201d]\n\nFor the record, while research is still ongoing, current studies support the theory that smoking cannabis significantly reduces the effects of PTSD. Check out this recent study.\n\nH/T: RawStory, Fleming.House.Gov, Fleming.House.Gov, ScienceDaily", "article_metadata": {"description": "Why then is Rep John Fleming (R-LA) looking to the federal government to block veteran's access to a drug that has been seen to relieve PTSD and Depression?", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "og": {"site_name": "Blue Nation Review", "description": "Why then is Rep John Fleming (R-LA) looking to the federal government to block veteran's access to a drug that has been seen to relieve PTSD and Depression?", "title": "GOP Congressman Shows Healthcare Hypocrisy on Veteran Access to Pot", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://bluenationreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/weedgop.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-05-21T14:05:05-04:00", "url": "https://bluenationreview.com/gop-congressman-shows-healthcare-hypocrisy-on-veteran-access-to-pot/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Blue Nation Review", "description": "Why then is Rep John Fleming (R-LA) looking to the federal government to block veteran's access to a drug that has been seen to relieve PTSD and Depression?", "title": "GOP Congressman Shows Healthcare Hypocrisy on Veteran Access to Pot", "image": {"src": "https://bluenationreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/weedgop.jpg"}, "creator": "@Mighty_Quinner", "site": "@bluenationrev", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Blue Nation", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/bluenationreview", "section": "Uncategorized", "tag": "#GOPocrisy,Brendan R Quinn,gop,John Fleming,medical marijuana,obamacare,pot,repeal obamacare,republican", "published_time": "2015-05-10T10:10:29-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-21T14:05:05-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "If healthcare providers want to jack up prices, and only cover conditions they feel like covering, choice in healthcare is his friend.\n\u201cThat is simply not the way health care works.\u201dThis is a change in narrative from the congressman, who\u2019s biggest claim to fame thus far has been his fight against Obamacare.\nWhy then is Republican Congressman John Fleming of Louisiana now looking to the federal government to block veteran\u2019s access to a drug that has been seen to relieve PTSD and Depression?\nIndividual freedom, the ability to make one\u2019s own choices without federal intervention, is a constant rallying cry.\n\u201cAs a practicing physician and a veteran myself, the way we approach health care is not to just allow any healthcare provider to do whatever he or she wants to do at the time.\u201d He said."}
