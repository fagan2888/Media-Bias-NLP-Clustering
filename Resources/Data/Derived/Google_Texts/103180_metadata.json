After Operation Rescue filed a complaint against him with the Oklahoma Health Department for crimes hard to stomach, police have raided abortionist Nareshkumar Gandalal \u201cNaresh\u201d Patel\u2019s office and sent him to prison.\n\nThe list of charges against him seems endless. A USA Today headline from last year read, \u201cOkla. doctor says he dumped fetuses,\u201d recounting how Patel dumped 60 fetuses in a field near Shawnee, Okla., and tried to burn them.\n\nIf that wasn\u2019t enough to put him behind bars, the handful of rape and sodomy charges against him certainly was.\n\nIn 1993, Patel was charged with one count of \u201cforcible oral sodomy\u201d and one count of sexual battery after a patient alleged that he had sexually assaulted her on an examination table prior to an abortion. She then recorded two phone conversations with him in which she alleged that he asked if she was angry about the assault and apologized for it. Three victims came forward and told of their encounters with Patel.\n\nThese victims\u2019 testimonies are extremely graphic, but you can read about their disturbing encounters with Patel here.\n\nIn addition to treating babies like discarded waste and reportedly treating women like tools, Patel is also charged with \u201cobtaining money by false pretenses\u201d and faces a slew of malpractice claims.\n\nIt\u2019s cases like this that prove Philadelphia abortionist Kermit Gosnell is not an anomaly. Gosnell, for those who don\u2019t recall, was convicted of murdering three babies born alive after failed abortions, as well as involuntary manslaughter of one of his patients. Patel\u2019s crimes might not seem so egregious as Gosnell\u2019s, but they\u2019ve both proven they\u2019re a danger to society.\n\nGosnell is now where he belongs and his filthy clinic was closed for good. Hopefully Patel and his abortion center face the same fate.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Dangers to society..05/25/2016 21:53:30PM EST.", "author": "Cortney O'Brien", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Dangers to society.", "title": "Cortney O'Brien - Abortionist Who \u2018Dumped Fetuses\u2019 and Faced Rape Charges Finally Arrested", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2014/12/10/abortionist-who-dumped-fetuses-and-faced-rape-charges-finally-arrested-n1929951", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2012/177/2012-06-25T145533Z_2_CBRE85O15G700_RTROPTP_3_USA.JPG", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Dangers to society.", "title": "Cortney O'Brien - Abortionist Who \u2018Dumped Fetuses\u2019 and Faced Rape Charges Finally Arrested", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2014/12/10/abortionist-who-dumped-fetuses-and-faced-rape-charges-finally-arrested-n1929951", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2012/177/2012-06-25T145533Z_2_CBRE85O15G700_RTROPTP_3_USA.JPG", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Abortionist Who \u2018Dumped Fetuses\u2019 and Faced Rape Charges Finally Arrested, Cortney O'Brien, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe05ff\"", "article_summary": "doctor says he dumped fetuses,\u201d recounting how Patel dumped 60 fetuses in a field near Shawnee, Okla., and tried to burn them.\nA USA Today headline from last year read, \u201cOkla.\nIf that wasn\u2019t enough to put him behind bars, the handful of rape and sodomy charges against him certainly was.\nThese victims\u2019 testimonies are extremely graphic, but you can read about their disturbing encounters with Patel here.\nUpdate: Patel has been released from jail on a $2,000 bail, but his facility remains closed."}
