John Kasich makes his expected entry into the race, he\u2019s likely to have a giant Obamacare target on his back.\n\nKasich says he is no fan of the president\u2019s health care law. But he fought his own party to implement one of its core components and is now gearing up to face GOP primary voters who want to rip the health law to shreds. His decision two years ago to embrace Obamacare\u2019s expansion of Medicaid to provide health coverage to low-income adults \u2014 a move that offered bipartisan cover to the White House during a tumultuous period \u2014 is likely to dog him in Iowa and New Hampshire.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nKasich made both a moral and economic case for covering the poor with mostly federal dollars. Many in his party disagree.\n\n\u201cWe were deeply disappointed at Gov. Kasich\u2019s actions on the Medicaid expansion battle in Ohio,\u201d said Tim Phillips, president of Americans for Prosperity, a conservative think tank supported by the Koch Brothers. \u201cObamacare is a core issue at this point for so many Americans who will most likely be participating in primaries and caucuses. The question of expanding Medicaid is arguably the most important state-level aspect of Obamacare that\u2019s in play.\u201d\n\nStrategists and political experts say the Medicaid issue alone isn\u2019t fatal to a Kasich candidacy, but it certainly doesn\u2019t help at a time when more than a dozen Republican candidates are groping to capture voters\u2019 attention.\n\n\u201cWhen you have so many candidates to choose from, you could be for a governor with a good record that didn\u2019t do that,\u201d said New Hampshire Republican strategist David Carney. \u201cThere are 12 or 15 flavors. If you love maple walnut ice cream but there\u2019s just too much maple, you go for something else.\u201d\n\nOther governors with 2016 aspirations have rejected Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion, including Wisconsin\u2019s Scott Walker, Louisiana\u2019s Bobby Jindal, and former Texas Gov. Rick Perry. And the Republican senators running for president \u2014 Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and Lindsey Graham \u2014 have all voted for repeal of Obamacare. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who may still join the race, enacted Medicaid expansion in a state where he faced intense pressure to do so from a solidly Democratic Legislature.\n\nKasich, on the other hand, undertook an extraordinary maneuver to bypass his Republican Legislature to expand Medicaid to hundreds of thousands of people. In the fall of 2013, he lobbied an obscure state board to unilaterally increase the state\u2019s Medicaid spending levels to accommodate the Obamacare program. Republicans howled and conservatives briefly targeted Kasich in a 2014 primary, but the furor died down.\n\nHis maneuver is unlikely to go unnoticed, however, in presidential politics. Kasich is fighting for the same center-right corner of the Republican base as former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who in 2013 actively lobbied lawmakers in his home state to reject Medicaid expansion even though the state\u2019s current Republican governor, Rick Scott, supported it at the time. He\u2019d enter the race as a long shot \u2014 he barely registers in early polls outside of Ohio \u2014 but he\u2019s hopeful that early stumbles by Bush will give him an opening to win support in early voting states likes New Hampshire.\n\nCritics of the expansion, which provides coverage to low-income individuals who make up to roughly $16,000 a year, say its costs will ultimately fall on the states, crowding out other priorities like education and public safety. Though Obamacare fully funds the cost of Medicaid expansion through 2016, states will gradually assume up to 10 percent of the cost.\n\nIn many states, including Ohio, Medicaid enrollment has vastly exceeded original projections, setting off alarm bells among conservatives who say the states and the federal government won\u2019t be able to afford it. Nearly 540,000 Ohioans have been covered through the expansion already.\n\nKasich allies point out that the governor won a resounding reelection bid last year with 64 percent of the vote and scared off his one brief primary opponent, despite his association with the Affordable Care Act. They argue that his earnest commitment to the program is actually refreshing to voters, who crave his straight talk and willingness to take unpopular stances.\n\n\u201cWhat they see is someone who is willing to do what he thinks is right from a policy perspective and put politics to the side,\u201d said spokesman Chris Schrimpf, who noted that nearly a dozen Republican governors have embraced the Medicaid expansion since Kasich did.\n\nKasich, however, was one of the few who supported a traditional Medicaid expansion, without the right-leaning policy elements that made the program more palatable to Republicans in other states, from Iowa to Arkansas to Indiana. His imminent candidacy comes as New Hampshire \u2014 where Kasich has been particularly aggressive \u2014 is in the midst of an intense partisan battle over the future of its own Medicaid expansion.\n\nKasich argues that he\u2019s only bringing back funding that Ohio sends to the federal government, and that the Medicaid expansion has led to savings elsewhere for the state. And one of Kasich\u2019s favorite defenses is that expanding Medicaid puts him in good company with the last Republican to expand Medicaid \u2014 Ronald Reagan. He\u2019s also irked Republicans by justifying his decision as a moral and religious imperative.\n\n\u201cNow, when you die and get to the meeting with St. Peter, he\u2019s probably not going to ask you much about what you did about keeping government small. But he is going to ask you what you did for the poor,\u201d he told reporters in Ohio in 2013.\n\nThat strategy works well in his home state and for independents, but it\u2019s not likely to be a big winner among GOP primary voters, said Robert Blendon, a professor of health policy and political analysis at the Harvard School of Public Health.\n\n\u201cYou just have to move onto other issues,\u201d he said.\n\nKasich has long argued that the Medicaid expansion established by Obamacare is different than Obamacare itself. He has joined the chorus of calls for repealing the entire law while contending that it\u2019s unconnected to Medicaid.\n\nBut that unusual semantic argument elicits scoffs from conservatives, too. The right has special hatred for Obamacare, but it also has separate qualms about Medicaid, arguing that the entitlement program has outgrown its original purpose of caring for low-income parents and people with disabilities.\n\nNearly all of the 21 states that haven\u2019t expanded Medicaid since the Supreme Court made it an optional program in 2012 are led by Republican governors. Just this year, fights over expanding the program have roiled state politics in Alaska, Florida, Montana, Tennessee and Wyoming.\n\nThough experts say a single issue isn\u2019t likely to sink Kasich, it could diminish his appeal among the conservatives who animate Republican presidential politics.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not compassionate to take a failing program and expand it by dumping millions of Americans in it,\u201d Phillips said. \u201cFor Gov. Kasich and others who have supported expanding this program, it\u2019s going to be a difficult explanation.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "In the 2016 GOP field, Kasich's embrace of the law\u2019s Medicaid expansion would stand out.", "title": "Obamacare looms over Kasich's presidential bid", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/06/obamacare-looms-over-kasichs-presidential-bid-119216.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2015/06/19/150619_john_kasich_ap_1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Obamacare,Elections,Republicans,2016 Elections,John Kasich,Ohio,John Kasich 2016,Affordable Care Act", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "In the 2016 GOP field, Kasich's embrace of the law\u2019s Medicaid expansion would stand out.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda65c\"", "article_summary": "Kasich has long argued that the Medicaid expansion established by Obamacare is different than Obamacare itself.\nThe Republicans running for president have practically made careers out of skewering Obamacare \u2014 so when Ohio Gov.\nThough Obamacare fully funds the cost of Medicaid expansion through 2016, states will gradually assume up to 10 percent of the cost.\nJohn Kasich makes his expected entry into the race, he\u2019s likely to have a giant Obamacare target on his back.\nIn the fall of 2013, he lobbied an obscure state board to unilaterally increase the state\u2019s Medicaid spending levels to accommodate the Obamacare program."}
