Despite marked improvement in the website\u2019s consumer functions, it is unclear what back-end problems remain and if the millions of Americans expected to purchase plans through the new insurance marketplace will be able to do so in time to have coverage that begins on Jan. 1.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s definitely been a huge improvement in the stability of the system and in the error messages,\u201d says Melisa Garcia, vice president of clinical business services for Legacy Community Health Services in Houston, which employs some 30 certified application counselors that assist those signing up for coverage. \u201cIt\u2019s been exponentially different,\u201d says Jodi Ray, project director for Florida Covering Kids and Families, which received a $4 million Affordable Care Act (ACA) grant to facilitate enrollment.\n\nBut even with the improvements, only a small percentage of people these counselors have helped to access the site have actually purchased coverage. Of the approximately 2,000 consumers Legacy has helped to use the insurance marketplace, Garcia says she can confirm that just 32 had signed up for coverage. (The rest may still be reviewing plans or planning to finish the process on their own.)\n\n(MORE: Obama Administration: \u2018We Have Met the Goal\u2019 of Fixing Website)\n\nThose low numbers track with the total figures for October, when the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) said just 106,185 people enrolled in new health insurance through HealthCare.gov and state-run ACA insurance websites. That total included consumers who had selected plans but not yet paid for them, and HHS had reportedly predicted some 500,000 would sign up during the month. HHS has said it will release enrollment figures for November later this month.\n\n\u201cOctober was homework month. November was window-shopping month. December is \u2018Let\u2019s hope they buy it\u2019 month,\u201d says Lisa Hamler-Fugitt, executive director of the Ohio Association of Foodbanks, which received a $2 million ACA grant to help consumers enroll in coverage.\n\nEnrollment counselors say many consumers shopping in the federal insurance exchange and those being run by 14 states are unfamiliar with the complexities of selecting health insurance. These consumers must compare premiums, deductibles, co-pays, co-insurance and the types of drugs covered by various plans \u2014 a time-consuming process that could not begin when the federal website wasn\u2019t working properly. And time is of the essence: for plans beginning on Jan. 1, the first month\u2019s premium needs to be paid by Dec. 23.\n\n\u201cEverybody doesn\u2019t talk insurance,\u201d says Ray. \u201cAll they know is \u2018I need to see a doctor, and I haven\u2019t had a mammogram in seven years because I haven\u2019t had health insurance.\u2019\u201d\n\nSigning up for coverage through HealthCare.gov is often a multiday process for consumers buying plans on their own. For those in need of assistance at one of thousands of community organizations facilitating enrollment across the country, that can mean making multiple trips to meet with in-person counselors.\n\n(MORE: No Thanksgiving Celebrations for Obamacare Website Team as Deadline Nears)\n\n\u201cUnless clients come in completely prepared and having done a lot of research ahead of time, we don\u2019t recommend they purchase until they get a chance to go through all the plans,\u201d says Garcia. Multiple appointments with enrollment counselors and \u201cnavigators,\u201d consumer-assistance workers whose salaries are paid through the ACA, has strained community-based nonprofit organizations like Legacy. \u201cSome people need multiple appointments just to get to the point where they could compare plans,\u201d says Garcia. \u201cWe have people working later in the evenings, weekends. It has been a drain on resources.\u201d\n\nFederal health officials said traffic to the improved website surged on Monday, with 750,000 visitors as of 5:30 p.m. A new queuing system was employed whenever about 35,000 users logged on, according to Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services spokeswoman Julie Bataille, meaning many consumers had to wait for available website slots to sign up for accounts and select plans. Bataille said one software bug that has caused insurers to receive garbled consumer information has been repaired, but she declined to release data on how frequently insurers had received incorrect information or how widespread the problem remains. She recommended that consumers contact insurers directly to verify their enrollment. Insurers have said back-end website problems could cause some consumers to incorrectly believe they have coverage when they do not. And some reporters and consumers using HealthCare.gov on Monday said they had encountered error pages, despite Bataille\u2019s assurances that the website was working well.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Health-insurance-enrollment counselors in several large states said on Monday\u00a0that the problem-plagued\u00a0HealthCare.gov\u00a0was operating reasonably well for the first time since its Oct. 1 launch, with clients able to use the site with relative ease throughout the day.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "Enrollment counselors on the front lines praise fixes to the federal health website, but that doesn't mean more people are signing up", "title": "HealthCare.gov No Longer a Complete Fail | TIME.com", "url": "http://swampland.time.com/2013/12/02/healthcare-gov-no-longer-a-complete-fail/", "image": "https://timeswampland.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/ap371932039539.jpg?w=753", "type": "article"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Political insight from the Beltway and beyond", "fb": {"admins": "1124331582,512158401,808970553,100000018008769", "app_id": 53177223193}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://swampland.time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/11d9978cfec7d5a71822113fdc067df5?s=16", "application-name": "Swampland", "keywords": "health care, uncategorized, affordable care act, healthcare.gov, obamacare, obamacare enrollment", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/time"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "health care, uncategorized, affordable care act, healthcare.gov, obamacare, obamacare enrollment"}, "article_summary": "Multiple appointments with enrollment counselors and \u201cnavigators,\u201d consumer-assistance workers whose salaries are paid through the ACA, has strained community-based nonprofit organizations like Legacy.\nInsurers have said back-end website problems could cause some consumers to incorrectly believe they have coverage when they do not.\nEnrollment counselors on the front lines praise fixes to the federal health website, but that doesn't mean more people are signing upCharles Dharapak / AP President Barack Obama speaks about his signature health care law.\nEnrollment counselors say many consumers shopping in the federal insurance exchange and those being run by 14 states are unfamiliar with the complexities of selecting health insurance.\nBut even with the improvements, only a small percentage of people these counselors have helped to access the site have actually purchased coverage."}
