The New York Federal court opened a law suit on Friday. The case was filed by Microsoft against Samsung in which a conflict over patent royalties of Smartphones will be discussed and resolved. Microsoft is claiming $6.9 million interest from Samsung. A selective version of this suit was filed in August as well.

The lawsuit in US District Court, Southern District of New York is Microsoft Corp vs. Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, 14-6039.

Microsoft appealed from the Court that Samsung must pay interest on more than $1 billion in royalty payments which it delayed in protest at Microsoft’s planned purchase of rival Nokia’s handset business as it did not break the Business Collaboration Agreement with Samsung as yet.

As per the law suit Samsung has paid the royalty for the year after which they signed the contract in 2011 and in September 2013 Microsoft announced Nokia deal which breached the licensing agreement according to Samsung’s point of view. So initially Samsung was not ready to pay later on it paid to Microsoft inevitably. This payment was without the interest in spite of the fact that it was late payment.

On Friday, Samsung did not instantaneously act in response to a appeal for remarks. On the contrary, Microsoft stated that:

“Google Android mobile system uses some of its technology, and as a result most hardware makers, including Samsung, have agreed to pay patent royalties on Android handsets”.

Moreover Microsoft has also filed a lawsuit against Motorola as well which is an important holdouts, and Motorola has been in proceedings since 2008.
