Twenty different agencies, meanwhile, are involved in consumer product safety oversight.\n\nBut some of the most striking findings came in financial assets the government is holding \u2014 particularly its oil stockpile.\n\nGAO chief Gene Dodaro said the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, at 691 million barrels of crude oil, is worth some $45 billion. But with U.S. production skyrocketing, reserves within the country make it possible to reduce the stockpile.\n\nInvestigators said the government could easily sell off some $7 billion in oil while still maintaining a huge reserve and meeting its legal obligations.\n\n\u201cThere may be the potential to reap billions of dollars of savings,\u201d Mr. Dodaro told the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee in presenting his findings.\n\nGAO also identified other money the government is sitting on, including a $1.6 billion revolving fund at the Treasury Department dedicated to an environmental cleanup that\u2019s already been completed. Liquidating that money could provide more immediate cash for the government.\n\n\u201cGAO\u2019s findings demonstrate that simply spending more money and creating more programs is not the solution to society\u2019s ills,\u201d said Sen. Ron Johnson, Wisconsin Republican and chairman of the committee, in receiving the report.\n\nDuplication has become a major focus for both Congress and the administration after former Sen. Tom Coburn, Oklahoma Republican, managed to work language into a 2010 law that required the GAO to do study redundancies.\n\nMr. Coburn said the reports belie the claims from both the administration and some Republicans and Democrats in Congress that the government budget has been trimmed enough in recent years.\n\n\u201cGAO is seeing double nearly everywhere it looks and that should leave taxpayers seeing red,\u201d Mr. Coburn said in a statement to The Washington Times. \u201cBy once again identifying billions of dollars spending on unnecessary duplication, much of it within the Pentagon, GAO has disproven the claims of Washington politicians and bureaucrats that there is nothing left to cut in the budget.\u201d\n\nThis year\u2019s report is the fifth iteration.\n\nThe previous four listed 188 different areas of overlap, and detailed 440 different actions Congress and the Obama White House could take to try to fix things. Of those, 169 actions have been completed \u2014 saving the government more than $20 billion so far, with another $80 billion in savings expected by 2023.\n\nBut that still leaves billions of dollars more still to be wrung out of previously identified inefficiencies and the two dozen new areas in the 2015 report, the GAO said.\n\nAmong the potential waste or duplication items GAO found were:\n\n\u2981 The Social Security Administration has cut its reviews of childhood disability claims by 70 percent, even though those reviews oftentimes find that the recipients were no longer eligible for the benefits they were claiming. The savings over five years could total $3.5 billion, the GAO said.\n\n\u2981 Medicare could restructure the way it pays cancer hospitals, which is based on a 1980s model. Restructuring could save $500 million a year.\n\n\u2981 More than 100 federal programs are aimed at helping those with serious mental illness, though coordination is lacking, the GAO said. It recommended the Health and Human Services Department take the lead in coordinating the government\u2019s efforts.\n\n\u2981 The Department of Homeland Security\u2019s open-records process is so dysfunctional that some requests for immigration information have to be processed by two separate agencies.\n\n\u201cToday, DHS is responsible for more than half of all reported backlogged FOIA requests. That is completely unacceptable,\u201d House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz, Utah Republican, said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The federal government is sitting on billions of dollars in money and valuable resources it no longer needs and could capitalize on to help reduce the deficit or pay for other priorities, Congress's chief investigative arm reported Tuesday.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The federal government is sitting on billions of dollars in money and valuable resources it no longer needs and could capitalize on to help reduce the deficit or pay for other priorities, Congress\u2019s chief investigative arm reported Tuesday.", "title": "Feds sitting on billions of dollars of unused assets", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/apr/14/feds-sitting-billions-dollars-unused-assets/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/09/24/obama-unjpeg-09f28.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/09/24/obama-unjpeg-09f28.jpg", "description": "The federal government is sitting on billions of dollars in money and valuable resources it no longer needs and could capitalize on to help reduce the deficit or pay for other priorities, Congress's c", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Feds sitting on billions of dollars of unused assets"}, "Author": "Stephen Dinan", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Social Issues, Business Finance, Politics, Congress"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3682\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThere may be the potential to reap billions of dollars of savings,\u201d Mr. Dodaro told the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee in presenting his findings.\nBut some of the most striking findings came in financial assets the government is holding \u2014 particularly its oil stockpile.\nBut that still leaves billions of dollars more still to be wrung out of previously identified inefficiencies and the two dozen new areas in the 2015 report, the GAO said.\nThe federal government is sitting on billions of dollars in money and valuable resources it no longer needs and could capitalize on to help reduce the deficit or pay for other priorities, Congress\u2019s chief investigative arm reported Tuesday.\nGAO chief Gene Dodaro said the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, at 691 million barrels of crude oil, is worth some $45 billion."}
