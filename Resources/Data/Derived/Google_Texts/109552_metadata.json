Nor did the state-of-the-art construction\u2014the brand-new pipeline was installed only last year\u2014stand up to whatever caused it to burst and let loose the volume of two Olympic-sized swimming pools of muck.\n\n\"This is a modern pipeline,\" Ron Bailey, Nexen's senior vice-president of Canadian operations, told the Canadian Press. \"We have pipeline integrity equipment, some very good equipment,\" he said. \"Our investigation is looking through exactly why that wasn't alerting us earlier.\"\n\nRELATED: Oil Sands Spill in Alberta Is One of Biggest in Canada\u2019s History\n\nThe company apologized for the breakage.\n\n\"We are deeply concerned with this,\" said Ron Bailey, Nexen's senior vice-president of Canadian operations, according to CBC News. \"We sincerely apologize for the impact this had caused.\"\n\nThe Alberta Energy Regulator (AER) issued an Environmental Protection Order to Nexen, directing the company to contain the spill, identify and notify affected parties, and test the area for hydrocarbons and chlorides; develop plans to manage the body of water near where the spill occurred, reduce or eliminate affects on wildlife, and map out remediation methods. The company must also post daily public progress reports on its website and submit a final report to the AER within 30 days of completing all the work involved.\n\nFort McMurray First Nation, whose treaty rights encompass some of the spill area, want Nexen to do better than that. When the company is gone, in however many decades it takes, they want the area to be left as pristine as when the company found it.\n\n\u201cOur biggest concern is the land,\u201d said Fort McMurray First Nation band councilor Byron Bates to the Canadian Press. \u201cIn 50 or 70 years, the oil companies are going to be gone. We want to be able to use our land again. Our biggest concern is to make sure it\u2019s brought back to pristine condition.\u201d\n\nThe fear, of course, is that the likelihood of that degree of remediation is about as remote as the area of the spill.\n\n\"There is no way to clean or reclaim the muskeg,\" said Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation spokesperson Eriel Deranger in a news release quoted by CBC News on July 18. \"Destruction and contamination like this that directly affects a key component of our ecosystems is affecting First Nations' ability to access lands and territories for hunting, fishing, gathering and trapping rights, rights protected by both the Constitution and our treaties.\"\n\nThe spill endangers the ecosystem, said Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation Chief Allan Adams in a statement quoted by the National Observer.\n\n\u201cA spill this size into the Muskeg, which is an important part of the eco-system in the region and houses many of our medicines, berries and habitat for species our people rely on for sustenance, is extremely serious,\u201d Adams said. \u201cThe muskeg are a part of the basin and feed into the groundwater system. The location of the spill is dangerously close to the Clearwater River that flows directly into the Athabasca River. The repercussions from the incident could potentially be felt far and wide by those that rely on the Athabasca Basin.\u201d\n\nFirst Nations as far away as British Columbia echoed those concerns.\n\n\"It\u2019s incredibly disturbing to know that this spill went undetected for a significant period of time. We\u2019re not sure how long it took for the volume that is being reported to leak out,\u201d said Union of B.C. Indian Chiefs Grand Chief Stewart Phillip in Vancouver, according to the National Observer. \u201cWe\u2019re constantly told that there are world-class systems in place that closely monitor the operations of all oil carrying pipelines, and clearly that\u2019s not the case. We\u2019re being grossly misinformed by industry.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "Nexen Energy apologized for pipeline break that sent 35,000 gallons of emulsion into the muskeg, as First Nations demanded accountability.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "theresa", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/07/20/grossly-misinformed-first-nations-want-answers-13-million-gallon-spill-alberta-161144", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/alberta_oil_spill-nexen_energy_image-larry_macdougal-the_canadian_press.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "\u2018Grossly Misinformed\u2019: First Nations Want Answers to 1.3 Million Gallon Spill in Alberta"}, "abstract": "Nexen Energy apologized for pipeline break that sent 35,000 gallons of emulsion into the muskeg, as First Nations demanded accountability.", "keywords": "Alberta Oil Sands, Athabasca Oil Sands, Oil Pipeline, Oil Spills, Nexen Energy", "dc": {"title": "\u2018Grossly Misinformed\u2019: First Nations Want Answers to 1.3 Million Gallon Spill in Alberta"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/07/20/grossly-misinformed-first-nations-want-answers-13-million-gallon-spill-alberta-161144", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "robots": "follow, index", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 1}, "dcterms.date": "2015-07-20T19:45-04:00", "dcterms.title": "\u2018Grossly Misinformed\u2019: First Nations Want Answers to 1.3 Million Gallon Spill in Alberta"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0089\"", "article_summary": "\"We are deeply concerned with this,\" said Ron Bailey, Nexen's senior vice-president of Canadian operations, according to CBC News.\n\"Destruction and contamination like this that directly affects a key component of our ecosystems is affecting First Nations' ability to access lands and territories for hunting, fishing, gathering and trapping rights, rights protected by both the Constitution and our treaties.\"\n\"This is a modern pipeline,\" Ron Bailey, Nexen's senior vice-president of Canadian operations, told the Canadian Press.\nFort McMurray First Nation, whose treaty rights encompass some of the spill area, want Nexen to do better than that.\nRELATED: Oil Sands Spill in Alberta Is One of Biggest in Canada\u2019s HistoryThe company apologized for the breakage."}
