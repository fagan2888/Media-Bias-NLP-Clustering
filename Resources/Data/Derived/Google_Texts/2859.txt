BALTIMORE, Sept. 8 (UPI) -- NAACP President and Chief Executive Officer Benjamin Jealous announced Sunday he has resigned effective the end of the year.

In a release posted on the civil rights group's website, NAACP Board Chairwoman Roslyn M. Brock said she had accepted Jealous' formal letter of notice this week. Jealous, a 40-year-old law school professor, has led the 104-year-old, 300,000-member organization for five years.

"We thank President Jealous for his time leading the association," Brock said. "Under his leadership, the NAACP has built a highly competent staff that will carry our mission forward and meet the civil rights challenges of the 21st century. Our board, staff and volunteer leaders throughout the country deeply appreciate his sacrifice, and will continue to implement our game-changing goals for the next half century that include the restoration of Section 4 of the Voting Rights Act, implementing Trayvon's Law, bolstering civic engagement efforts and ensuring our community is enrolled in the Affordable Care Act exchanges."

Jealous said he was leaving the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, which has its headquarters in Baltimore, in better shape than he found it and said his next position would be in education.

"The NAACP has always been the largest civil rights organization in the streets, and today it is also the largest civil rights organization online, on mobile and at the ballot box too," Jealous said in a statement. "I am proud to leave the association financially sound, sustainable, focused and more powerful than ever.

"Beginning next year, I look forward to pursuing opportunities in academia to train the next generation of leaders and, of course, spending a lot more time with my young family."
