Didn\u2019t his wife warn him that gloating is unattractive?\n\nCruz dresses down for his visit, donning a sweater and jeans. He digs his left hand into his pocket, only to remove it every few seconds to gesture. A speech coach might advise him to keep that hand resting at his side\u2014repeatedly parking it in his pocket makes him look like Beaver Cleaver\u2014but Cruz is too busy comparing himself to Ronald Reagan to worry about his comportment.\n\nA pastor\u2019s son, Cruz is a biblical whiz.\n\n\u201cScripture tells us there\u2019s nothing new under the sun,\u201d he says.\n\nLater, he urges us to evaluate candidates by applying the \u201cbiblical test\u201d of \u201cyou should know them by their fruits.\u201d\n\nI wait for him to translate for ignoramuses like me. He means that you should look at what candidates do, not what they say. You knew that, right?\n\nOrating with a preacher\u2019s cadences, Cruz can say nothing and make it sound profound.\n\n\u201cThe great thing about eternal truths is they\u2019re always true,\u201d he marvels. I look around. People are nodding thoughtfully, especially the guy wearing a \u201cBenghazi Matters\u201d button.\n\nPardon me for applying intrusive logic, but Cruz asks the crowd of 300, \u201cHow many people have had their [health insurance] premiums go up?\u201d\n\nGazing at all the raised hands, Cruz concludes, \u201cTake a look around at what ObamaCare is doing in the state of New Hampshire.\u201d\n\nWait a sec. Without ObamaCare, those same hands would surely go up. Health insurance costs were soaring before 2010 and would\u2019ve continued to soar.\n\nThen Cruz promises that he\u2019d let Americans \u201cfill out taxes on a postcard.\u201d In the next breath, he vows to abolish to IRS.\n\nWait a sec. Without the IRS, where do we send that sinfully simple postcard?\n\nCruz is only getting started.\n\n\u201cJimmy Carter endorsed Donald Trump,\u201d he says. \u201cI am not making that up. That is real.\u201d\n\nSomehow, I missed that newsy tidbit.\n\nCruz explains that Carter reasoned that Trump is \u201cmalleable\u201d without \u201ccore beliefs\u201d that he\u2019d fight for as president. But Carter apparently frowns on Cruz\u2019s unshakable conservative principles.\n\nActually, Carter has said he\u2019ll support the Democratic nominee. But given the choice between Trump and Cruz, he\u2019d pick Trump.\n\nCruz or Trump? You pick. Just leave me out of it.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "blog", "robots": "index,follow", "vf": {"unique_id": "1b0ba2936c49febba6a31de429270eff"}}, "article_summary": "But given the choice between Trump and Cruz, he\u2019d pick Trump.\nThen Cruz promises that he\u2019d let Americans \u201cfill out taxes on a postcard.\u201d In the next breath, he vows to abolish to IRS.\nCruz explains that Carter reasoned that Trump is \u201cmalleable\u201d without \u201ccore beliefs\u201d that he\u2019d fight for as president.\nCruz or Trump?\nOrating with a preacher\u2019s cadences, Cruz can say nothing and make it sound profound."}
