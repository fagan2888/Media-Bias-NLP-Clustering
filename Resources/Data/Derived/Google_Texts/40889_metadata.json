The process, known as repatriation, would impose a 14 percent tax rate on foreign profits to generate money to help pay for the transportation funding bill.\n\nRepublicans have said they would be open to a repatriation plan, but only if it is offered on a voluntary basis as a \u201ctax holiday\u201d at a lower rate.\n\nThe disagreement has stalled a debate over transportation funding that has dominated talk in Washington for most of the year.\n\nThe typical source of transportation funding has been revenue that is collected by the 18.4 cents-per-gallon federal gas tax.\n\nThe gas tax, which is currently 18.4 cents-per-gallon, typically brings in about $34 billion. But the federal government typically spends about $50 billion on transportation projects.\n\nThe gas tax has not been increased since 1993, and improvements in the fuel efficiently of U.S. autos has sapped much of its purchasing power.\n\nTransportation advocates have pushed to increase the gas tax to close the infrastructure funding gap, but lawmakers have been reluctant to ask drivers to pay more at the pump.\n\nThe Department of Transportation has said, meanwhile, that its Highway Trust Fund will run out of money in late July or early August unless Congress comes to an agreement about an infrastructure funding extension.\n\nTransportation Secretary Foxx is scheduled to appear at events in Washington, D.C., Tennessee, California and Iowa this week for \u201cInfrastructure Week\u201d to put pressure on them to do so.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Federal road funding is set to expire on May 31.", "description": "Federal road funding is set to expire on May 31.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Keith Laing", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Federal road funding is set to expire on May 31.", "title": "\u2018Infrastructure week\u2019 kicks off amid highway bill uncertainty", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/241589-infrastructure-week-kicks-off-amid-highway-bill-uncertainty", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/highway_070314thinkstock.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-05-11T09:44:55-04:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2015-05-11T09:44-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/241589-infrastructure-week-kicks-off-amid-highway-bill-uncertainty", "dcterms.date": "2015-05-11T09:44-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Keith Laing", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Highway bill, Highway Trust Fund, Gas Tax, Repatriation, MAP-21 Reauthorization,Joe Biden, Anthony Foxx,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-11T09:44:57-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-11T09:44:55-04:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/241589-infrastructure-week-kicks-off-amid-highway-bill-uncertainty", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Federal road funding is set to expire on May 31.", "card": "summary", "title": "\u2018Infrastructure week\u2019 kicks off amid highway bill uncertainty"}, "dcterms.title": "\u2018Infrastructure week\u2019 kicks off amid highway bill uncertainty"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb0e0\"", "article_summary": "The disagreement has stalled a debate over transportation funding that has dominated talk in Washington for most of the year.\nThe typical source of transportation funding has been revenue that is collected by the 18.4 cents-per-gallon federal gas tax.\nTransportation Secretary Foxx is scheduled to appear at events in Washington, D.C., Tennessee, California and Iowa this week for \u201cInfrastructure Week\u201d to put pressure on them to do so.\nTransportation advocates are planning a week of events to highlight the need for investing in the nation\u2019s infrastructure amid mounting uncertainty about the future of federal road and transit funding.\nThe gas tax, which is currently 18.4 cents-per-gallon, typically brings in about $34 billion."}
