It was Donald. \u201cTurn on Megyn Kelly. She is reporting about an MSNBC commentator\u2019s claim that using the term \u201cObamacare\u201d is the same as calling him the N word.\u201d http://bit.ly/18QPu5V\n\nMSNBC\u2019s Melissa Harris Perry\u2019s accusation is absurd. It is an obvious weak attempt to distance the president from Obamacare which is wreaking havoc in the lives of millions of Americans who are losing their health care.\n\nWhat I found most disturbing and what I wish to focus on is Perry\u2019s evil attempt to gin up hate against \u201cwealthy white men\u201d who she claims created the term \u201cObamacare\u201d to demean and undermine the black president.\n\nDue to the Obama Administration playing the race card to win every argument and silence opposition, America is polarized along racial lines. Perry\u2019s false accusation is like throwing gasoline on the flames of national racial tensions; as irresponsible and cruel as screaming fire in a crowded auditorium.\n\nMelissa Harris Perry\u2019s specific use of the term \u201cwealthy white men\u201d was insidiously strategic. Low info blacks in my family along with blacks across America will believe Perry\u2019s nonsense to be the gospel truth. With the wave of black flash mob violence and the rising incidents of the racially motivated knockout game, the last thing we need as a nation is another black TV celeb promoting a racially charged false narrative.\n\nDemocrats and liberals like Melissa Harris Perry have been promoting the same irresponsible, divisive and racist false narrative for decades. They claim that all evil in the world is the fault of racist, greedy, sexist and evil wealthy white men usually identified as conservative Republicans.\n\nMelissa Harris Perry\u2019s rant is simply the latest blow to the chin of America\u2019s white males by a liberal. Flash back to New York Times columnist, Maureen Dowd\u2019s 2009 article titled, \u201cWhite Man\u2019s Last Stand.\u201d Dowd\u2019s article excoriated white men. http://bit.ly/1bsYmc5\n\nObama and company\u2019s reelection strategy was centered around a shock-and-awe media blitz branding the Republican nominee, Mitt Romney as an evil super-wealthy racist white guy. http://bit.ly/1cz7noO\n\nSo, we get it. While political correctness is the unwritten law of the land, it is open season on trashing and targeting the American rich white male for destruction; even deemed morally correct and patriotic.\n\nWho is out there giving rich white men props for their many positive contributions to society? Where are their advocates? I am sure with me being an American black man, liberals think it unconscionable that I would suggest such a thing; elevating me to \u201csuper\u201d Uncle Tom status.\n\nIn 1895, Booker T. Washington formed a coalition of black leaders, politicians and white philanthropists (rich white guys), with a long-term goal to build the black community\u2019s economic strength and pride by focusing on self-help, education and entrepreneurship. http://bit.ly/19fDhpF\n\nMelissa Harris Perry\u2019s ridiculous claim that the term \u201cObamacare\u201d is the new N word is laughable. The N word is defined as a contemptuous term for a black or dark-skinned person. Sadly, American rich white men are viewed with a similar contemptuousness; despised, kicked around and unfairly mistreated.\n\nBottom line, Ms Perry and the whole liberal machine pushing the war on rich white men should be ashamed of themselves. The left\u2019s hate speech is ripe with negative consequences for the lives of real people; decent folks who simply worked hard, made good choices and achieved their American Dream.\n\nWhy should they be demonized in such a way as to inspire violence against them? It simply is not right.\n\nStaff Writer; Lloyd Marcus\n\nChairman of The Campaign to Defeat Barack Obama.\n\nPlease help me spread my message by joining my Liberty Network.\n\nLloyd is singer/songwriter of the American Tea Party Anthem and author of Confessions of a Black Conservative, foreword by Michele Malkin.\n\nMore Articles:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://thyblackman.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/2013-MSNBC-MelissaHarrisPerry.jpg"}, "language": "en", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde4ed\"", "article_summary": "You are here: Home News / Melissa Harris Perry; The War on Rich White Men.\nMelissa Harris Perry; The War on Rich White Men.\nBottom line, Ms Perry and the whole liberal machine pushing the war on rich white men should be ashamed of themselves.\nSadly, American rich white men are viewed with a similar contemptuousness; despised, kicked around and unfairly mistreated.\nWho is out there giving rich white men props for their many positive contributions to society?"}
