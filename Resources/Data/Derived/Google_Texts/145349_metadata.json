That\u2019s the legal standard, so it\u2019s hardly a surprise it was obeyed.\n\nBut not everyone is thrilled with a standard that tilts the scales of justice so decisively in the cops\u2019 favor nearly every single time. Libertarian-leaning Republican Rep. Justin Amash had this to say about the Tamir Rice decision on Twitter:\n\nPolicing cannot be both risk-free and effective. Officers must be patient, put own lives at risk to responsibly manage dangerous situations. \u2014 Justin Amash (@justinamash) December 29, 2015\n\nWe are grateful to those police officers who sacrifice their own safety to effectively and responsibly protect our communities and families. \u2014 Justin Amash (@justinamash) December 29, 2015\n\n@poorpeeps Police should not be given more leniency when it comes to self-defense than any other person. \u2014 Justin Amash (@justinamash) December 29, 2015\n\nThat last point is something I also raised on Twitter yesterday. In a sane world, one might expect the cops to receive less leniency than ordinary citizens in cases where they kill a harmless, unarmed boy. After all, they are trained to successfully navigate tense situations: it\u2019s literally their job to go to great lengths to keep people alive. We might even expect the police\u2014again, the people we pay to take on some degree of risk\u2014to use a different calculus than the average person when weighing threats to their own lives against threats to others.\n\nAs Jamelle Bouie writes at Slate:\n\nPart of policing is risk. Not just the inevitable risk of the unknown, but voluntary risk. We ask police to \u201cserve and protect\u201d the broad public, which\u2014at times\u2014means accepting risk when necessary to defuse dangerous situations and protect lives, innocent or otherwise. It\u2019s why we give them weapons and the authority to use them; why we compensate them with decent salaries and generous pensions; why we hold them in high esteem and why we give them wide berth in procedure and practice. What we see with Tamir Rice\u2014and what we\u2019ve seen in shootings across the country\u2014is what happens when the officer\u2019s safety supercedes the obligation to accept risk. If \u201cgoing home\u201d is what matters\u2014and risk is unacceptable\u2014then the instant use of lethal force makes sense. It\u2019s the only thing that guarantees complete safety from harm. It\u2019s also antithetical to the call to \u201cserve and protect.\u201d But it\u2019s the new norm.\n\nIndeed. And as long as the norm prevails, there will be more Tamir Rices\u2014and more grieving mothers deprived of justice. The lives of the agents of the state matter infinitely more than the lives of regular people.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Why do the police get away with crimes ordinary citizens would go to jail for?", "title": "Justin Amash on Tamir Rice Outcome: Cops Don\u2019t Deserve Extra Leniency", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2015/12/29/justin-amash-on-tamir-rice-outcome-cops", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/1451407861499.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Why do the police get away with crimes ordinary citizens would go to jail for?", "title": "Justin Amash on Tamir Rice Outcome: Cops Don\u2019t Deserve Extra Leniency", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/1451407861499.jpg", "creator": "@robbysoave", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "Justin Amash", "published_time": "2015-12-29T16:57:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/robby-soave"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "article_summary": "\u2014 Justin Amash (@justinamash) December 29, 2015@poorpeeps Police should not be given more leniency when it comes to self-defense than any other person.\n\u2014 Justin Amash (@justinamash) December 29, 2015That last point is something I also raised on Twitter yesterday.\nLibertarian-leaning Republican Rep.
