For many who live there receiving quality health care is not a possibility. But last week Operation Lone Star provided many with a chance to get needed medical treatment.\n\nThere are two rows of portable dental chairs along the baseline at the Palmview high school gym in Mission, Texas. The chairs are filled with patients - many are having extensive work done on their teeth after a lifetime of neglect.\n\n\u201cThey live with this pain for many years \u2013 some people don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to live with pain on their teeth,\u201d said Dr. Joshua Liescheski, a faculty member of Texas A&M University Baylor College of Dentistry.\n\n\u201cWe are either pulling teeth that can\u2019t be saved or filling those that we can hopefully prevent from getting worse,\u201d he said.\n\nThis is part of Operation Lone Star which every year for one week brings emergency medical treatment to this impoverished area. And resources are limited said Blanca Cantu, the La Joya ISD public relations officer.\n\n\u201cDental slots \u2013 were 200 slots available \u2013 and vision - there were 50 vision slots available and they were all topped by 8 in the morning,\u201d she said.\n\nCantu is helping the Texas Department of State Health Services for this effort. She says people started lining up at the High School as early as 2 in the morning to get one of those dental slots. It\u2019s been described as a scene reminiscent of Black Friday. But instead of people scrambling for discounted home electronics they are competing for health care.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been here since three in the morning.\u201d\n\n15-year old Eduardo is here with his family. They are among the lucky ones and are being treated. I asked him why he came. He opens his mouth wide and points to the back of his teeth.\n\n\u201cTo get my\u2026.(tooth? Molar? Wisdom tooth? ) Yah. (did they fix you?) Yah, they did good. It\u2019s awesome.\u201d\n\nThere were five locations along the Texas Mexico border for Operation Lone Star - from Brownsville to Laredo. They mainly delivered immunizations, diabetic screening and physical examinations. Last year 11 thousand people were seen.\n\nThe Texas State Guard is one of the lead agencies because the core of this action is a military training exercise.\n\n\u201cThe real reason the state supports Operation Lone Star is it is part of the practice and planning for how we treat a disaster.\u201d said Brigadier General Doctor David Cowen, the Commander of the Texas State Guard Medical Brigade.\n\n\u201cWe are here as part of what is called the practicing the incident command system which was started by FEMA after 911 and Katrina to make sure that multiple agencies and multiple organizations come together is what is called the Unified Command,\u201d he said.\n\nThe idea behind the training exercise is to work out the bugs in coordinating state relief agencies so when a major disaster hits Texas the state guard and others can react faster and more effectively.\n\n\u201cBut the side benefit and quite honestly the reason why most of us joined the Texas State Guard is because we are providing real medical care as part of that and we provide a lot of medical care. We see people who otherwise may not get medical care very often,\u201d he said.\n\nSo, all this free medical care that\u2019s being delivered to this community during Operation Lone Star that\u2019s just incidental and that irritates Sister Phyllis Peters the director of Proyeto Juan Diego.\n\n\u201cWell, when you have 70% of the people without health insurance they take what they can get,\u201d Sister Phyllis said.\n\nProyeto Juan Diego is a non-profit that works to help low income families get access to health care. It\u2019s located in the heart of Cameron Park, one the largest and poorest colonias in the United States.\n\nSister Phyllis is frustrated and she bangs her hands on the table as she talks. She said they used to participate in Operation Lone Star but stopped because she says it wasn\u2019t doing enough to help the people with serious medical issues.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t mean to sound hard \u2013 but if you are going to screen them \u2013 you gotta provide a program that\u2019s going to take care of them. How would you like to know that you have cancer but there\u2019s nothing you can do? There\u2019s no place you can go. Nobody will take you,\u201d she said.\n\nOperation Lone Star does try to direct people they find with serious medical issues to local social services. But the people don\u2019t have health insurance, Medicaid or Medicare coverage. Sister Phyllis says these people have no options.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we need expanded Medicaid \u2013 and if we don\u2019t\u2019 get that \u2013 which I know our legislature is not for that but then they\u2019ve got to come up with something else,\u201d she said.\n\nThat something else has been for Texas the 11-15 waver.\n\nBecause Texas didn\u2019t expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act - Texas healthcare providers for the last four year have received billions of dollars from the federal government for treating the uninsured.\n\nBut the waiver expires in September 2016. And the federal government is indicating it won\u2019t extend the waiver. It wants Texas to get with expanded Medicaid. Sister Phyllis says if the 11-15 money goes away \u2013 she won\u2019t be able to offer real preventative health care that she provides now. And the annual line to get emergency treatment at Operation Lone Star is going to get a lot longer.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Texas", "description": "The Rio Grande Valley along the Texas Mexico border is one of the most impoverished regions in the nation.
