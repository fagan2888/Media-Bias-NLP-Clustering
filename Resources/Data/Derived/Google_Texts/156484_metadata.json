Howard W. Smith, a segregationist Democrat from Virginia, stood on the floor of the House to propose an amendment to the Civil Rights Act. Title VII of the bill, which the chamber had been debating for a week, was written to ban employment discrimination because of race, color, religion, and national origin. To the list, Smith added one more category: sex.\n\nThe House, which counted just a handful of female members, erupted in laughter. \u201cI am serious,\u201d Smith drawled. \u201cIt is indisputable fact that all throughout industry women are discriminated against.\u201d\n\nIn that moment Smith helped catalyze the modern feminist movement\u2014even though, or perhaps because, his motives were hardly feminist. Smith\u2019s mischievous intervention has long been told as an amusing footnote, and opponents of expanded women\u2019s rights, especially early on, used it to stymie efforts to expand gender equality in the workplace. But the story deserves more attention, because beneath its surface lie the sort of ironic complexities that often define our political history. The tale of Smith\u2019s amendment is really about the circuitous and unpredictable ways that legislators and activists combine to push society forward.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nSmith had previously tried all sorts of tricks to block Title VII from becoming law as the chairman of the Rules Committee, which approves legislation before it gets to the House floor. Adding sex to the bill, he figured, could undermine Title VII by forcing the government to spend time and resources cracking down on discrimination based on gender, and not just race. At the very least, he hoped to cause mayhem among the liberal supporters of the bill, many of whom had an easier time imagining racial equality than gender equality.\n\n\u201cThey want to know why you did not include sex in this bill. Why did you not?\u201d\n\nStill, the amendment passed, and when President Lyndon Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act on July 2, 1964, it became illegal for employers to discriminate on the basis of sex. It was a moment when women\u2019s rights activists were finally making other gains\u2014most notably with the 1963 Equal Pay Act, which mandated the same wages for the same work and which John Kennedy signed. When Title VII of the proposed act was added a few months later, the activists saw a chance for an even bigger gain. Adding one word\u2014\u201csex\u201d\u2014to the list of protected classes could revolutionize the workplace. The problem was, no one wanted to introduce the amendment: Even the groups\u2019 allies were afraid it would scare off tentative conservative supporters of the Civil Rights Act, who might support a bill to help minorities, but not women. So the women turned to Smith.\n\nThe racism of Howard W. Smith\u2014\u201cJudge\u201d to his colleagues\u2014was well-known: As the head of the Rules Committee, he had let dozens of civil rights bills wither and die. Less well-known was his quiet support for women\u2019s rights. A longtime friend of Alice Paul, co-founder of the National Woman\u2019s Party, Smith had been a regular sponsor of equal rights amendment bills since 1945. So when the women\u2019s groups asked him to introduce the Title VII amendment, he said yes.\n\nSmith first gave notice during the Rules Committee hearings in early January 1964. \u201cI have just received a letter this morning, which I was going to bring to your attention later, from the National Women\u2019s [sic] Party,\u201d he said to Rep. Emanuel Celler of New York, who was testifying as one of the bill\u2019s sponsors. \u201cThey want to know why you did not include sex in this bill. Why did you not?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nNever one to pass up a chance at shtick, Celler played along. \u201cIt reminds me of the Frenchman who was going up the Empire State Building in New York. Somebody said, \u2018How do you like it?\u2019 He said, \u2018Well it reminds me of sex.\u2019 \u2018Reminds you of sex? Why is that?\u2019 The answer was, \u201cEverything reminds me of sex.\u2019 \u201d\n\nSmith didn\u2019t laugh. \u201cI have not found out yet why you did not put sex in,\u201d he continued a few minutes later. \u201cI think I will offer an amendment.\u201d\n\nThe following month, when Smith made good on his promise, Celler immediately rose in joking opposition. \u201cI can say as a result of 49 years of experience,\u201d he said, \u201cthat women, indeed, are not in the minority in my house. I usually have the last two words, and those words are \u2018yes, dear.\u2019 \u201d\n\nMore serious opposition came from Edith Green of Oregon, whom the White House had asked to speak against Smith\u2019s amendment. Both Green and the Johnson administration worried that the proposal would make the bill harder to pass. \u201cAt the risk of being called an Aunt Jane, if not an Uncle Tom,\u201d she said, \u201clet us not add any amendment that could get in the way of our primary objective.\u201d Despite the opposition, the amendment passed 168\u2013133. When the vote was announced, a woman in the gallery shouted, \u201cWe've won, we've won!\u201d Another yelled, \u201cWe made it, God bless America!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nSmith\u2019s motives were complex, to say the least. No doubt he saw the amendment as a tool to gum up the bill, before and after passage. But while it may seem incongruous today, it didn\u2019t seem contradictory to him to be against civil rights and for gender equality. In fact, Smith\u2019s commitment to white supremacy fits neatly with a racist strain of the mid-20th-century women\u2019s movement that gained currency in response to civil rights advances: objecting to giving labor protections to black men, but not white women.\n\nAt first, Smith\u2019s amendment drew only widespread ridicule. This is the part of the story you may have heard before. The New York Times editorial board worried that the Rockettes would now be forced to include male dancers. Franklin D. Roosevelt Jr., the chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission tasked with putting Title VII into practice, considered the provision a joke. When a reporter asked \u201cwhat about sex?\u201d he replied, \u201cDon\u2019t get me started. I\u2019m all for it.\u201d Roosevelt and a majority of his commissioners had no intention of enforcing the ban. In September 1965 they voted to permit gender discrimination in job advertising.\n\nBut the EEOC\u2019s curt dismissal of the sex discrimination ban provided just the sort of immediate, concrete challenge that the burgeoning modern feminist movement needed to generate momentum. Two of the EEOC commissioners, Aileen Hernandez and Richard Graham, dissented from the job-advertising ruling, and the next year joined several dozen people in forming the National Organization for Women. Though NOW\u2019s charter outlined a broad set of goals, its first concern was forcing the EEOC and Congress to take Title VII\u2019s sex discrimination provision seriously. Allies of the movement soon fell in line. The United Auto Workers, among others, said, \u201cWe reject out of hand\u201d the idea that the provisions were a fluke. \u201cThe point is that Congress did bar employment discrimination on sex grounds, and that bar should be vigorously enforced.\u201d\n\nBy the early 1970s, the feminist movement had produced its own lawyers, who honed their skills by pushing courts to enforce Title VII against workplace discrimination. It also developed a powerful lobbying force in Washington, which led to a series of bills that strengthened the Civil Rights Act, including a 1972 law extending it to cover local, state, and federal governments.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.subheadline": "Fifty years ago a Southern segregationist made sure the Civil Rights Act would protect women.
