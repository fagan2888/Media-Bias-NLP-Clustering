But a lingering left hamstring strain kept him on the bench again. He likely won\u2019t start until Sunday, at the earliest. But he wanted to make one thing clear:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going on the DL,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can put that in bold letters.\u201d\n\nCuddyer met with Rockies head athletic trainer Keith Dugger on Friday and they decided it was best for Cuddyer to sit.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m getting better,\u201d Cuddyer said, his leg still bruised from the strain. \u201cBut Doogie didn\u2019t want to risk it. I wouldn\u2019t be able to go out and blow it up every play because the risk is too high right now.\u201d\n\nThe Rockies put the veteran right fielder on waivers earlier this week, according to Fox Sports\u2019 Ken Rosenthal, who reported the Rockies then pulled his name back because of the injury.\n\nRockies officials would not comment, and it\u2019s not known whether any teams attempted to claim Cuddyer. Clubs will often place players on waivers with no intention of letting them go, just to gauge the interest of other teams.\n\nEither way, the Rockies will not trade Cuddyer before his three-year, $31.5 million contract expires after this season. If the Rockies put him on waivers again, it would be irrevolcably \u2014 meaning, teams could claim him without having to offer anything in return.\n\nCuddyer, 35, the defending National League batting champ, is hitting .331 this season but over just 33 games. He missed 59 games with a broken shoulder after diving for a ball playing third base.\n\n\u201cAny time you have a bleed out in your hamstring it\u2019s a considerable injury,\u201d Rockies manager Walt Weiss said. \u201cI think he\u2019s coming around but he\u2019ll probably still need another day or two.\u201d\n\nCall-up time. The Rockies over the next week will begin deciding on September call-ups when game-day rosters are allowed to expand to 40 players.\n\n\u201cThere are several people in on that decision,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cSome of the guys you want to reward for having a good season, some of them you want to look at for next year. There\u2019s some budgetary issues and all those things are factors. Those are the conversations that we\u2019ll be having for the next week or so.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Michael Cuddyer hamstring injury lingers; Rockies pull him off waivers", "title": "Michael Cuddyer hamstring injury lingers; Rockies pull him off waivers", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/22/michael-cuddyer-hamstring-injury-lingers-rockies-pull-him-off-waivers/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140822_073138_michael-cuddyer.jpg", "height": 523}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140822_073138_michael-cuddyer.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-22T19:34:46+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T10:08:39+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cAny time you have a bleed out in your hamstring it\u2019s a considerable injury,\u201d Rockies manager Walt Weiss said.\nEither way, the Rockies will not trade Cuddyer before his three-year, $31.5 million contract expires after this season.\nRockies officials would not comment, and it\u2019s not known whether any teams attempted to claim Cuddyer.\nIf the Rockies put him on waivers again, it would be irrevolcably \u2014 meaning, teams could claim him without having to offer anything in return.\nMichael Cuddyer, who hit for the cycle and played 18 innings of a doubleheader Sunday, was almost certain he\u2019d return to the Rockies lineup Friday against Miami."}
