Curate Peer-Generated Resources\n\nToday\u2019s consumers are information driven, and they\u2019re highly dependent on stories from their peers. It\u2019s important to remember that doctors are only one part of the health education ecosystem \u2014 patients want to learn from fellow patients about how to manage their conditions and pay their bills.\n\nDoctors and healthcare providers won\u2019t have all the answers. That\u2019s why patients and caregivers are seeking health advice through channels including online discussion forums, blogs, and social media.

The original cost for the procedure was over $55K, which health insurance lowered to $11K.\n\nCommenters on Reddit quickly joined the conversation, sharing their own experiences about unexpected health events and expenses.\n\nOne 24-year-old had to file for bankruptcy to cover costs related to cancer. Even though Medical covered his $150K in expenses back in 2009, his follow-up care caused him to rack up $50K in debt. He did not have insurance, so he could not pay. The result?

They\u2019re rarely tied to their computers and constantly on the go. According to a Pew Center study, half of surveyed millennials say that they do most of their online browsing from a cell phone. And millennials aren\u2019t the only demographic that\u2019s dependent on their phones\u00a0\u2014 across the age spectrum, 34 percent of cell users reported that they mostly access the Internet using their phones. \u00a0 When it comes to mobile, users demand information quickly, efficiently, and seamlessly. They don\u2019t want to be scrolling excessively or filling out lengthy forms. \u00a0 \u201cMobile experiences are often a series of micro interactions \u2013 quick tasks that the user performs, often in a highly distracting, public environment using a very small screen,\u201d explains UX expert Laura Klein in a recent interview about designing mobile experiences. \u201cA good mobile experience keeps important tasks quick, obvious, interruptible, and performable with a limited about of input.\u201d The first step to designing an elegant user experience is research. In addition to web analytics software like Google Analytics, health providers can use tools like UserTesting to collect input about what potential users are thinking and feeling. You can avoid costly mistakes by testing your website before setting it live. 2. Curate Peer-Generated Resources Today\u2019s consumers are information driven, and they\u2019re highly dependent on stories from their peers. It\u2019s important to remember that doctors are only one part of the health education ecosystem\u00a0\u2014 patients want to learn from fellow patients about how to manage their conditions and pay their bills. \u00a0 Doctors and healthcare providers won\u2019t have all the answers. That\u2019s why patients and caregivers are seeking health advice through channels including online discussion forums, blogs, and social media. Healthcare providers, however, can learn a powerful lesson from some of social media\u2019s biggest influencers\u00a0\u2014 content curation is just as important as content creation. \u00a0 If you find a great story or piece of information, keep it on file using a tool like Pocket. When patients come to you with questions, you\u2019ll have an arsenal of consumer-friendly stories to immediately share. \u00a0 Let\u2019s say you\u2019re dealing with a twenty-something who\u2019s skeptical about buying health insurance, for instance. \u201cI\u2019m too healthy\u201d may be what she says. You can respond by showing her this thread that recently went viral on Reddit, a popular website for sharing and commenting on content. \u00a0 The story features a 20-year-old man who underwent an appendectomy \u2014 an unexpected and unpredictable medical procedure\u00a0\u2014\u00a0in October 2013. The original cost for the procedure was over $55K, which health insurance lowered to $11K. Commenters on Reddit quickly joined the conversation, sharing their own experiences about unexpected health events and expenses. \u00a0 One 24-year-old had to file for bankruptcy to cover costs related to cancer. Even though Medical covered his $150K in expenses back in 2009, his follow-up care caused him to rack up $50K in debt. He did not have insurance, so he could not pay. The result? His bankruptcy will pose a significant hurdle to major life milestones including buying a house, pursuing a career, and getting married. A healthcare provider isn\u2019t in the optimal position to teach patients these invaluable lessons\u00a0\u2014 but she can connect her patients to powerful resources and stories from fellow healthcare consumers. \u00a0 Link to the 3rd tip below: Read the 3rd Tip on referralMD\u2019s Blog", "card": "summary", "title": "Millennials and Healthcare: 3 Tips to Reach Young, Stubborn Patients"}, "fb": {"app_id": 148725768475669}, "google-site-verification": "xudQg7nxVR9ifmMTY4Tf-0wVtX9b6rWLQd0utCweGOc", "keywords": "weight loss, obesity, overweight,diabetes,massachusetts,medical devices,obesity,startups,healthcare innovation, medcity news,medcity news,san francisco, startups, life sciences,accelerator,rock health,startup advice,startup funding,patient monitoring system, motion sensors ,dc,healthcare it,washington,foodborne pathogens, diagnostics company, diagnostic platforms,minimally invasive surgery, laser surgery,cambridge,dealflow,hospitals,wellpoint, healthways, health and wellness, employee wellness programs,investing,wellness,medtronic, shanghai innovation center, china, r&d,china,mdt,minneapolis,minnesota,publics,twin cities,ulcerative colitis, abbott labs, humira,abbott labs,doctors,pharmaceuticals,skin disorders, pharmaceuticals, md anderson cancer center,cancer,texas,renal denervation, st. jude medical,st. jude medical,stj,emr, ehr, electronic health records, electronic medical records, certified emr,certified emr,ehr,electronic health records,electronic medical records,advanced cellular technology,amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,embryonic stem cells,geron corporation,lou gehrig\\'s disease,macular degeneration,regenerative medicine,spinal cord damage,value-based healthcare system, obamacare, fee-for-service model,california,cleveland,health insurance,insurance,ohio,pennsylvania,politics,cancer treatment options library, aetna, aet, healthcare it,aet,aetna,health it,phi,philadelphia,, MedCity News", "article": {"section": "Health IT", "published_time": "2014-02-24T11:58:59-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-02-26T08:25:33-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,width=device-width,user-scalable=no,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd82d8\"", "article_summary": "The following 3 technology tips can help healthcare providers build strong millennial relationships.\nPhysicians and healthcare providers can\u2019t afford to circumvent Gen Y quirks \u2014 the more effective and efficient solution is an appeal towards their skeptical influences.\nHealthcare providers, however, can learn a powerful lesson from some of social media\u2019s biggest influencers \u2014 content curation is just as important as content creation.\nIn addition to web analytics software like Google Analytics, health providers can use tools like UserTesting to collect input about what potential users are thinking and feeling.\nDoctors and healthcare providers won\u2019t have all the answers."}
