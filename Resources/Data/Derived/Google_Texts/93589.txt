A Lynn Haven man is dead after a one-vehicle accident around 4 p.m. Friday.

Florida Highway Patrol officials say 20-year-old Ian Raymond McKeever was driving a 2006 Toyota Tundra westbound in Suwannee County on I-10 near Mile Marker 286 at a high rate of speed.

Officials say he lost control of the truck as he changed from the inside to the outside lane.

His vehicle left the highway and went onto the grass shoulder where he struck a tree on the passenger's side.

He was taken to Lake City Medical Center where he was pronounced dead.
