(AP) - Rattled but mostly unhurt, New York Giants punter Steve Weatherford said he\u2019s just happy to be alive after totaling a rented car on the New Jersey Turnpike early Monday as he tried to return home for practice from watching the birth of a daughter in California.\n\nHe flew east from his offseason home in San Diego on Sunday night after welcoming the 10 1/2-pound baby - his fourth child - but was diverted from Newark to Washington because of thunderstorms pelting the East Coast. He landed too late to catch a train north, so rented a car for the four-hour drive.\n\nWeatherford posted a picture of the mangled car on Instagram after the 3:30 a.m. crash (http://bit.ly/1AFSikk ), saying it wrecked as he hit \u201ca massive body of water\u201d going about 70 mph.\n\n\u201cI hydroplane, slam into the median, get blasted in the face by the air bags,\u201d Weatherford said. \u201cMy rental is totaled and I walked out without a scratch.\u201d\n\nLess than 2 minutes after he left the car, another car going 65 mph to 70 mph slid out of control in the same spot and hit his rental.\n\n\u201cI had put my blinkers on and had gotten out of the car and I was just getting ready to call 911,\u201d he said. \u201cBefore I could call I looked behind me and heard the splash.\u201d\n\nWeatherford roused the unconscious, bloody driver, then helped him out of the car where they waited for New Jersey State Police.\n\n\u201cThere was a lot of adrenaline pumping through my veins,\u201d he said. \u201cIt probably helped that I was 225 pounds and motivated.\u201d\n\nNew Jersey state troopers eventually drove him 45 miles home to Hoboken.\n\nNew Jersey State Police said on Facebook: \u201cTwo words about Steve: Class act. Also, congratulations! Best of luck with your family\u2019s new addition!\u201d\n\nThe player showed up later at his team\u2019s workout with only minor facial cuts and burns, participating after missing three previous voluntary offseason team activities while waiting for the daughter to be born. He reported only some slight soreness after practicing.\n\n\u201cThe first thing that popped into my mind was how he rushed to get back here,\u201d Giants coach Tom Coughlin said. \u201cHe\u2019d been home for quite a while and was anxious and we shared the fact that it was a difficult thing to leave your wife and newborn. But he wanted to get back here and on the field.\u201d\n\nWeatherford said he didn\u2019t want to worry his wife and contemplated not revealing the accident when she called 50 minutes after the crash, but disclosed it and said he was OK.\n\n\u201cShe made me get off the phone and onto Facetime right away so she could see my face,\u201d said Weatherford, who spoke with a small bandage on the left side of his lower lip. \u201cI tried to cover up my lip.\u201d\n\n___\n\nNOTES: The Giants said it would use walk-through metal detectors for security screenings this season, in line with new NFL regulations. \u2026 Wide receiver Odell Beckham, Jr. fielded one punt during practice, but largely stayed out of drills with a sore left hamstring. Coughlin said it was precautionary. \u2026 Third-year safety Cooper Taylor, who sat out last season with broken left foot, ran with second-round rookie Landon Collins on the first unit defense while projected starter Nat Berhe nursed a strained calf.\n\n___\n\nAP NFL websites: www.pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rattled but mostly unhurt, New York Giants punter Steve Weatherford said he's just happy to be alive after totaling a rented car on the New Jersey Turnpike early Monday as he tried to return home for practice from watching the birth of a daughter in California.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Rattled but mostly unhurt, New York Giants punter Steve Weatherford said he\u2019s just happy to be alive after totaling a rented car on the New Jersey Turnpike early Monday as he tried to return home for practice from watching the birth of a daughter in California.", "title": "Giants punter unhurt in hydroplaning crash on NJ Turnpike", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jun/1/giants-punter-unhurt-in-hydroplaning-crash-on-nj-t/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/06/01/978f8d6279d92818780f6a706700a292.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/06/01/978f8d6279d92818780f6a706700a292.jpg", "description": "Rattled but mostly unhurt, New York Giants punter Steve Weatherford said he's just happy to be alive after totaling a rented car on the New Jersey Turnpike early Monday as he tried to return home for", "card": "summary", "title": "Giants punter unhurt in hydroplaning crash on NJ Turnpike"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "\u201cIt probably helped that I was 225 pounds and motivated.\u201dNew Jersey state troopers eventually drove him 45 miles home to Hoboken.\nNew Jersey State Police said on Facebook: \u201cTwo words about Steve: Class act.\n\u201cThe first thing that popped into my mind was how he rushed to get back here,\u201d Giants coach Tom Coughlin said.\nHe landed too late to catch a train north, so rented a car for the four-hour drive.\n\u201cBefore I could call I looked behind me and heard the splash.\u201dWeatherford roused the unconscious, bloody driver, then helped him out of the car where they waited for New Jersey State Police."}
