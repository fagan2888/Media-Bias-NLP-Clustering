But does it really?\n\nThe Daily Signal reached out to the bank\u2019s biggest supporters\u2014Exporters for Ex-Im, American Action Forum, National Association of Manufacturers, U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Bankers Association for Finance and Trade\u2014to ask whether Ex-Im creates jobs and, if so, how.\n\n\u201cEx-Im supports private sector companies, big and small, that create jobs by helping them reach new market opportunities overseas,\u201d said Lauren Airey, director of trade facilitation policy at the National Association of Manufacturers. \u201cWithout access to Ex-Im Bank, some U.S. companies would fail to meet the bid requirements for major infrastructure and energy projects\u2014taking significant export opportunities off the table.\u201d\n\nThe groups have partnered with a broad coalition of manufacturers to form Exporters for Ex-Im, which supports the bank\u2019s reauthorization.\n\n\u201cJob creators throughout the country say the Ex-Im Bank allows them to grow and hire, and that if Ex-Im goes away, so would jobs,\u201d the group told The Daily Signal when asked if the bank creates jobs. \u201cWhen U.S. companies can grow sales abroad, they can grow jobs at home. That\u2019s why it\u2019s imperative for Congress to reauthorize Ex-Im now.\u201d\n\nEx-Im\u2019s charter expires June 30, and policymakers on Capitol Hill are debating whether to reauthorize it or allow the agency to wind down.\n\nFor groups supporting the agency, a common argument in favor of Ex-Im\u2019s reauthorization is that it creates jobs.\n\n\u201cIn fact, extending the bank\u2019s charter is one of the best ways to create jobs and help America\u2019s struggling small businesses,\u201d Tom Donohue, president of the Chamber, wrote in an op-ed on Monday. \u201cFailure to reauthorize Ex-Im over the long term would amount to unilateral disarmament in the face of $1 trillion in trade finance extended by over 60 countries.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt would put American exporters at a significant disadvantage in tough global markets and risk more than 150,000 jobs at 3,000 companies that depend on the bank,\u201d he continued.\n\n>>> House GOP Leader: It\u2019s Time to \u2018Wind Down\u2019 Export-Import Bank\n\nAdditionally, in an April letter to House and Senate leadership, the Bankers Association for Finance and Trade advocated for Ex-Im\u2019s reauthorization because of its positive impact on job creation.\n\n\u201cEx-Im works creatively with banks and exporters to help create and retain U.S. jobs by helping ensure that deals are not lost to overseas competition and unfair trade practices,\u201d the letter said.\n\nDespite repeated assertions from bank proponents that Ex-Im creates jobs, those opposing its reauthorization are quick to point out a lack of empirical evidence supporting such claims. Outside data also shows the bank has a mixed record on job creation.\n\n\u201cIt is stunning those who say Ex-Im creates jobs are unwilling or incapable of providing any evidence to support their claim,\u201d Dan Holler, spokesman for Heritage Action for America, told The Daily Signal. \u201cEither way, it should be clear to everyone that Ex-Im isn\u2019t creating jobs in America.\u201d\n\nHeritage Action is one of more than 50 groups calling for the bank\u2019s end.\n\nA 2011 report from American Action Forum did find that the bank creates jobs in specific industries. But across the economy, Ex-Im has a different impact.\n\n\u201cFor the economy as a whole, export financing merely redistributes jobs across the economy rather than create more overall jobs,\u201d the report said. \u201cIn addition, Ex-Im\u2019s economic impact analysis process may be insufficient to guard against risks such as harm to U.S. industries that compete with subsidized foreign purchasers of U.S. exports.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, a 2013 report from the Government Accountability Office found that the bank frequently references jobs \u201csupported,\u201d rather than \u201ccreated\u201d because its methodology makes it difficult to differentiate between jobs created and retained.\n\n\u201cBecause of a lack of reporting on the assumptions and limitations of its methodology and data, Congressional and public stakeholders may not fully understand what the jobs number that Ex-Im reports represents and the extent to which Ex-Im\u2019s financing may have affected U.S. employment,\u201d the report stated.\n\nAt a joint congressional hearing last month, Rep. Mick Mulvaney, R-S.C., pressed Ex-Im Chairman Fred Hochberg on the claim that the bank \u201ccreates jobs.\u201d\n\nMulvaney referenced concerns voiced by House Speaker John Boehner on the consequences of Ex-Im\u2019s end.\n\n\u201cThere are thousands of jobs on the line that would disappear pretty quickly if the Ex-Im Bank were to disappear,\u201d Boehner, R-Ohio, told reporters.\n\nWhen Mulvaney asked Hochberg about the \u201cthousands of jobs on the line,\u201d the bank chairman argued the agency was \u201cdemand driven,\u201d which prevented him from predicting how many jobs would \u201cdisappear\u201d because of Ex-Im\u2019s end.\n\nMulvaney, though, contended that even if Congress allowed Ex-Im\u2019s charter to expire, existing financing would not be effected through the life of the loans and loan guarantees.\n\n\u201cIf you disappear on June 30, there\u2019s still going to be Export-Import Bank presence, supporting jobs for the next 18 years,\u201d the South Carolina Republican said.\n\n>>> \u2018Wasted Seat\u2019: Chamber of Commerce Official Takes to Twitter to Rip GOP Congressman on Ex-Im Bank Stance", "article_metadata": {"description": "Many of the Export-Import Bank\u2019s biggest supporters argue the controversial agency creates jobs.
