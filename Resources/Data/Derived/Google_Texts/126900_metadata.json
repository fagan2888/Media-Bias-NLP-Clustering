Does it matter that one lies to the families of the Benghazi dead, or another lies about not supporting a war, when maybe he did. More important, what would this candidate do if given more power? Because we\u2019re about to give them more power. The past predicts the future. What would your candidate do? That question forces you to put principal before personality, specifics over strength. See, Donald Trump taught us it\u2019s okay to be wrong, as long as you\u2019re strong. It\u2019s why you see so much child-like adulation from grown men. If Trump said, \u2018Make daddy a drink,\u2019 how many talking heads would rush to the bar? But that\u2019s not his fault, it\u2019s those who let personality trump principle. We hate left-wing tribalism. You know, when you\u2019re critical, you\u2019re disloyal. Maybe we\u2019ve become that, too, calling lifelong conservatives RINOs for criticizing a lifelong, whatever. We see now the establishment versus outsider shtick was baloney meant to halt criticism. For as Rush and Mark Levin now hit Trump too, are they establishment also? Again, what would your choice do if he or she had more power? Would they abandon promises for popularity? Or choose revenge over reason? If you don\u2019t care to ask, then you get the president you deserve.\u201d\n\nLater, after playing a clip of Trump saying that he likes the mandate in Obamacare and doesn\u2019t want people dying in the streets and that poor people could be taken care of \u201cunder concepts of Medicare.\u201d Gutfeld stated, \u201c[T]his is a liberal canard, that if you are not for a social program, you want people to die in the streets. That\u2019s something you heard in a cocktail party in 2007, 2008 along with \u2018Bush lied, people died.\u2019 So, he \u2014 this is \u2014 I mean, he is a liberal. Donald Trump is a liberal.\u201d\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett", "article_metadata": {"description": "Gutfeld: 'Donald Trump Is a Liberal,' 'The Establishment Versus Outsider Shtick Was Baloney'", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Gutfeld: 'Donald Trump Is a Liberal,' 'The Establishment Versus Outsider Shtick Was Baloney'", "title": "Gutfeld: 'Donald Trump Is a Liberal,' 'The Establishment Versus Outsider Shtick Was Baloney' - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/02/Gutfeld-218-Thumbnail.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2016/02/19/gutfeld-donald-trump-is-a-liberal-the-establishment-versus-outsider-shtick-was-baloney/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Gutfeld: 'Donald Trump Is a Liberal,' 'The Establishment Versus Outsider Shtick Was Baloney'", "title": "Gutfeld: 'Donald Trump Is a Liberal,' 'The Establishment Versus Outsider Shtick Was Baloney' - Breitbart", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/02/Gutfeld-218-Thumbnail.jpg", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Donald Trump, Greg Gutfeld, Hillary Clinton,2016 Presidential Race, Breitbart TV, Obamacare,Gutfeld", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "Hillary Clinton", "published_time": "2016-02-19T16:58:11-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart TV,2016 Presidential Race,Obamacare"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "Donald Trump is a liberal.\u201dFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett\nSee, Donald Trump taught us it\u2019s okay to be wrong, as long as you\u2019re strong.\nWe see now the establishment versus outsider shtick was baloney meant to halt criticism.\nFor as Rush and Mark Levin now hit Trump too, are they establishment also?\nIf Trump said, \u2018Make daddy a drink,\u2019 how many talking heads would rush to the bar?"}
