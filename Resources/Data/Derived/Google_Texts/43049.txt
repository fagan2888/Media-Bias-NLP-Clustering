During Senator Mitch McConnell (R., KY) opening remarks on the Senate floor Monday, he made a compelling argument for why a delay in the implementation Obamacare is reasonable request.

Sen. McConnell cited the poor rollout of Obamacare and the many problems consumers have faced as a reason why a one-year delay in implementation of Obamacare would be reasonable.

Sen. McConnell’s remarks are below:

MITCH McCONNELL: Well, we’re now in the second week of a government shutdown that nobody claims to want.

Democrats say it’s unreasonable to ask for any changes or delays to Obamacare. And Republicans, well, we think the Obamacare rollout has proven beyond the shadow of a doubt just how reasonable a delay is. I mean, if anybody had any doubts about the need to delay this thing, those doubts should have been allayed this weekend when the administration admitted its website wasn’t working and took it offline for repairs.

Delay and basic fairness are what Republicans are asking for at this point — not exactly the sun and the moon.
