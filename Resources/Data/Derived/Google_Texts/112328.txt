Love bacon and eggs? Three strips of fried bacon have nearly 10 grams of fat. Reduce this to a half slice per person and use it to season Swiss Chard and Ricotta Frittata With Bacon. Sprinkling the cooked bacon over the frittata before popping it under the broiler makes it more visible and more flavorful. And you've dramatically reduced the fat. Bulk up the frittata with kale for a super-food breakfast, lunch or dinner. This egg dish reheats well, too, so for those of us with smaller families, it's a prep-once, eat-twice meal.

Rather than go heavy on shrimp in Garlicky White Bean and Tomato Stew With Shrimp, I do just the opposite, figuring a mere 3 ounces of shrimp per person. The reduced seafood has another side benefit: It keeps this dish affordable. And check out how simple it is to make. Once you've gathered your ingredients, it takes about 15 minutes to prepare from start to table. Serve it with a hunk of bread and with salad for a soul-satisfying cool-weather supper. Thin any leftovers with broth for an instant hearty soup later in the week.

And soup, of course, is the perfect way to use meat as a flavoring. Rather than starting with ground chicken in my Quick Italian Wedding Soup, I use seasoned Italian chicken sausage, which means a shorter ingredient list and less preparation. I call for Israeli couscous — I like the way it simmers up into little pasta pearls — but if you can't find it, simply substitute another small pasta shape, such as orzo.

Sometimes at my house we still enjoy a nice steak or rack of lamb, but those meals are becoming less frequent as we discover that a little meat can add big flavor.
