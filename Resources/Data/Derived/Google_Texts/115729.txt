If you like monarch butterflies, we need your help.

Would you like to vote on the idea of having the monarch butterfly as Wisconsin's butterfly? Do you believe the DNR should create a public awareness campaign aimed at restoring more milkweed vegetation in Wisconsin? The monarch population has decreased by 95 percent since 1996.

These two questions will appear on the ballot at this year's Wisconsin Conservation Congress public hearing at 7 p.m. Monday in all 72 counties. There may also be discussions about the issue to change the DNR board from a policy-making board to an advisory board as proposed in the state budget.

You can preview all ballot questions and the location of your county hearing at dnr.wi.gov and search for Conservation Congress. The listing of the hearing questions, hearing locations and county delegates have been posted on my website at www.Butterflygardensofwisconsin.com.

The Wood County Conservation Congress hearing will be held in the auditorium of the Pittsville School District Administration Building, 5459 Elementary Ave., Pittsville.

Your support of the monarch butterfly would be appreciated.
