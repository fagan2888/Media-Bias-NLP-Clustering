They\u2019re willfully suspending disbelief in challengers who would have been considered laughable in earlier years.\n\nPolls show more Republicans favoring three candidates who have never held elective office than 14 candidates who have served a total of 150 years as governors or in Congress. Most Democrats are declining to favor a candidate who spent eight years each in the White House and the Senate and four as secretary of state.\n\nPsephologists of varying stripes attribute this discontent to varying causes. Conservatives blame insufficiently aggressive Republican congressional leaders. Liberals blame Hillary Clinton\u2019s closeness to plutocrats and her home-brew email system.\n\nBut in our system a widespread rejection of experienced leaders ultimately comes from dismay at the leader in the White House. In 1960 Richard Nixon, after eight years as vice-president and six in Congress, campaigned on the slogan, \u201cExperience counts.\u201d No one is running on that theme this year.\n\nNixon could, because over the preceding quarter-century most Americans mostly approved the performance of incumbent presidents. Presidents Roosevelt, Truman and Eisenhower still look pretty good more than 50 years later.\n\nBarack Obama doesn\u2019t. His deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes recently said that the president\u2019s nuclear weapons deal with Iran was as important an achievement of his second term as Obamacare was of the first. Historians may well agree.\n\nThese two policy achievements have many things in common.\n\nBoth were unpopular when proposed and are now. In March 2010 Speaker Nancy Pelosi said that people would discover, and presumably like, what was in the bill after it was passed. But most Americans didn\u2019t like it then, and most don\u2019t today, five and a half years later. As for the Iran deal, Pew Research reports it has only 21 percent approval today, much lower than Obamacare in 2010.\n\nBoth Obamacare and the Iran deal were bulldozed through Congress through legislative legerdemain. Democrats passed Obamacare by using the temporary 60-vote Senate supermajority gained through a Minnesota recount and the wrongful prosecution of Senator Ted Stevens. After they lost the 60th vote, they resorted to a dubious legislative procedure.\n\nThis year Obama labeled the Iran treaty an executive agreement and Congress concocted a process requiring only a one-third plus one rather than a two-thirds vote for approval. Only 38 percent of members of Congress supported it. Many, like House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, did so only after saying that they never would have accepted it in negotiations.\n\nIn 2008 Obama promised he would \u201cfundamentally transform\u201d America, and Obamacare and the Iran deal are indeed fundamental transformation of policy \u2014 transformations most Americans oppose.\n\nObamacare assumed that financial crisis and recession would make most voters supportive of or amenable to bigger government. But as National Review\u2019s Ramesh Ponnuru points out, polling doesn\u2019t show that. Obama assumed that if America \u201cunclenched its fist\u201d and propitiated enemies like the mullahs of Iran, they would become friends with us. Most Americans think that\u2019s delusional. No wonder voters are angry.\n\nRepublican voters are frustrated and angry because for six years they have believed they have public opinion on their side, but their congressional leaders have failed to prevail on high visibility issues. Their successes (clamping down on domestic discretionary spending) have been invisible. They haven\u2019t made gains through compromise because Obama, unlike his two predecessors, lacks both the inclination and ability to make deals.\n\nSo Republicans who imposed harsh litmus tests in previous presidential cycles \u2014 Did you ever support a tax increase? Have you ever wavered in opposing abortion? \u2014 are flocking to Donald Trump, a candidate who would fail every one of them. They are paying little attention to candidates \u2014 Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, Scott Walker, Chris Christie and Bobby Jindal \u2014 who advance serious proposals to change public policy.\n\nIn polls Democratic voters have stayed loyal to the president. But to listen to their candidates (and maybe-candidate Joe Biden) you would think we are in our seventh year of oppression by a right-wing administration. You don\u2019t hear much about the virtues of Obamacare or the Iran deal \u2014 or \u201cchoice.\u201d\n\nMost Americans hoped the first black president would improve race relations. Now most Americans believe they have gotten worse.\n\nAnd so a president who came to office with relatively little experience has managed to tarnish experience, incumbency and institutions.
