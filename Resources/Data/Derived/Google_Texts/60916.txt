Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Joe Sestak is airing his first television ad, launching a minute-long spot that emphasizes his military career.

Featuring shots of veterans and others holding signs that read, "Joe's got your six," a military term that references having someone's back, the ad also touts Sestak's support for Obamacare and his constituent work during his tenure in the U.S. House of Representatives.

"I'm running for the Senate to be the people's champion, to defend Obamacare, protect Social Security and to support our veterans," Sestak says in the ad. "I've got Pennsylvania's six."

His campaign declined to comment on the size of the ad buy. Sestak's staffers said it would air throughout the state, and filings from broadcast stations show that his campaign purchased ad slots beginning Wednesday in the Philadelphia, Harrisburg and Scranton media markets.

The ad buy comes as outside spending is beginning to flow into the four-way Democratic race to take on Republican U.S. Sen. Pat Toomey.

Accountable Leadership, a super PAC supporting Sestak, is spending $250,000 on ads across the state that detail Sestak’s 2010 race against Republican Pat Toomey, the three decades he spent in the Navy, and his stint in the U.S. House of Representatives.

EMILY’s List, a national group that supports female Democratic candidates, announced last week that it will spend $1 million to promote former environmental protection secretary Katie McGinty with ads beginning next month.

McGinty also has begun airing her own biographical ads in the Philadelphia and Pittsburgh media markets. Braddock Mayor John Fetterman, who also is seeking the Democratic nomination, is airing ads on cable and broadcast in the Pittsburgh media market.
