John Kasich will sign a bill to limit how municipalities can use red light and speed cameras, said his spokesman, Rob Nichols.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have the bill yet, so I don\u2019t have a sense of timing,\u201d he wrote in an email. \u201cBut the governor will sign it.\u201d\n\nSenate Bill 342 was passed by the House on Dec. 10, but not before two amendments were added \u2014 one to require a report of texting-while-driving violations as part of the legislature\u2019s future consideration for making it a primary violation, and the other to preserve the right of citizens to vote on banning red light and speed camera measures in their own cities.\n\nThe Senate concurred on the amendments Dec. 11 and sent the bill to the governor. It will go into effect 90 days after it\u2019s signed.\n\nCities and other jurisdictions who use the cameras said the provisions essentially would kill use of the devices, resulting in millions of dollars in lost revenue and increased accidents.
