Covered California pledges to do better this year.\n\nAsk Emily A series of Q&A columns answering consumers\u2019 questions about California\u2019s new medical world. Send questions for Emily to AskEmily@kff.org\n\nBut already, some Medi-Cal and Covered California enrollees are discovering errors, and they will have to wait for fixes.\n\n\u201cI received forms from both Covered California and Medi-Cal that were both completely inaccurate,\u201d says Aimee Roolvink, 44, of Glendora.\n\n\u201cGood luck trying to file your taxes with forms that have inconsistent numbers.\u201d\n\nToday, I\u2019ll explain who will receive the forms and what to do if they contain inaccuracies.\n\nLet\u2019s start with three points:\n\nIf you had a health plan through an insurance exchange such as Covered California last year, you must have a correct 1095-A form in hand to complete your taxes.\n\nMost others, who had insurance from employers, the open market or government programs such as Medicare or Medi-Cal, will receive a 1095-B or 1095-C form. You don\u2019t need these in hand to do your taxes.\n\nIf you had insurance from multiple sources last year, you may receive more than one 1095.\n\n1095-A\n\nThis form, which comes from health insurance exchanges, lists the amount of tax credits you received to help pay your premiums.\n\n\u201cIn terms of taxes, these forms are the most critical,\u201d says Debra Hammer of Intuit TurboTax.\n\nWhy? When you enrolled in your plan, you were asked to estimate your 2015 income, which determined your federal tax credits. When you complete your taxes this year, you\u2019ll have to report whether your actual income varied from your estimate.\n\nSince most of you received your tax credits in advance, you may either owe or be owed money if there\u2019s a difference.\n\nSo, if you find mistakes on your form, request corrections quickly.\n\nFor errors in your personal information \u2014 name, birthdate, Social Security Number or address \u2014 call Covered California at 800-300-1506.\n\nIf there\u2019s a mistake in the amount of tax credits you received or which months you were covered, or if your form is missing household members, fill out a dispute form online or call the same phone number to have the form filled out for you. You can find the dispute form via www.CoveredCA.com/members.\n\nThe agency says it will issue corrected 1095-As within 60 days of submission, though it blew the deadline for many consumers last year.\n\n1095-B and 1095-C\n\n1095-B forms are distributed by government-sponsored health programs, some employers and health insurance companies for policies purchased outside exchanges. 1095-C forms are issued by large employers and generally follow the same rules as 1095-Bs.\n\nThe IRS has extended to March 31 the deadline for sending the B and C forms to you.\n\nThese forms are primarily informational and show which months you had coverage.\n\nIf you have a B or C form and had insurance all of last year, you can just check a box on your tax return, Hammer says. If you didn\u2019t, you may owe a tax penalty \u2014 unless you qualify for one of Obamacare\u2019s many exemptions.\n\nBut you still need to make sure your forms are accurate, because the information is transmitted to the IRS, she says.\n\nThe Department of Health Care Services (DHCS), which administers Medi-Cal, is among the agencies sending out 1095-B forms for the first time. The department has established a toll-free help line (844-253-0883) that received more than 11,000 calls in January and more than 23,000 since November.\n\nConfusingly, that phone number isn\u2019t for people who discover mistakes on their forms. For that, you must contact your county Medi-Cal office to request a correction.\n\nUse Our Content This story can be republished for free ( details ).\n\nIf you receive Supplemental Security Income (SSI) or State Supplementary Payment (SSP) benefits, you must contact the Social Security Administration to update your information before you request a corrected form from your county, the department says.\n\nSome large counties have dedicated phone lines to handle changes to Medi-Cal cases, which may include 1095 form corrections, says Cathy Senderling-McDonald, deputy executive director of the County Welfare Directors Association of California. Ask if your county is one.\n\nBut don\u2019t expect quick action.\n\n\u201cIn order to give the client \u2026 the revised information, the county needs to either be able to submit a request for a reprint to the state or print it out directly,\u201d Senderling-McDonald says.\n\nCounties can\u2019t do that yet because the state computer system \u201chas not been programmed to allow for reprints to be done,\u201d she says.\n\nThat changes March 1 for information reportable to the IRS, says Tony Cava, DHCS spokesman. After that date, corrected forms will be mailed to consumers within 30 days of a request for fixes.\n\nFor information not reportable to the IRS, such as errors in personal information, replacement forms will be available starting April 1, he says.\n\nLeer Este Art\u00edculo En Espa\u00f1ol \u201c\u00bfAtormentados Por Los Formularios Impositivos Del Obamacare? Aqu\u00ed Est\u00e1 La Ayuda\u201d\n\nSince that\u2019s just two weeks before the tax filing deadline, it\u2019s important to remember you can file your taxes while you await corrections to B and C forms.\n\n\u201cIf you believe you had Medi-Cal for 10 months of the year, go ahead and fill out your tax form showing 10 months,\u201d says Jen Flory, senior attorney at the Western Center on Law & Poverty.\n\nIf you\u2019re among the Medi-Cal recipients who don\u2019t have to file taxes because you earned less than the tax filing threshold, you still don\u2019t have to file even if you receive a 1095-B form, Flory added. (However, you must file taxes if you receive a 1095-A, she notes.)\n\nRoolvink, the Glendora resident, submitted her Covered California dispute form in January and has spent dozens of hours on the phone trying to reach someone in her county Medi-Cal office. She\u2019s still waiting for corrections to both 1095 forms.\n\nHer forms showed that her husband and two daughters were on Medi-Cal when they actually had Covered California plans, she says.\n\n\u201cTo say this is a problem is really an understatement,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s been a nightmare.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Look carefully at your 1095 health care tax form: There's a chance it's pocked with errors.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "California Healthline", "description": "Look carefully at your 1095 health care tax form: There\u2019s a chance it\u2019s pocked with errors.", "title": "Taxed By Obamacare Tax Forms?
