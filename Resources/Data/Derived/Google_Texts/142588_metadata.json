With June 14th known as Flag Day around the U.S., many came to the Panama City Beach Fleet Reserve Association's flag retirement ceremony to show respect for the stars and stripes, and retire worn flags from all across the area.\n\nAfter serving in the Navy for 33 years, Tommy Grant says he holds a special place in his heart for the red, white, and blue.\n\n\"I know what it took to defend this flag, and this flag to me is freedom,\" said Grant. \"It's freedom, liberty, and it's all for that our forefathers fought for us to get.\"\n\nBeing his second ceremony with the Boy Scouts Troop 317, Alex Hansen says he thinks it's great to give those who haven't participated before a chance to see how flags are properly retired.\n\n\"I think its pretty cool how it's also a learning experience for them, so they can learn and pass it down to others that come,\" said Hansen.\n\nAccording to Grant, the current way to properly retire a flag dates back all the way to the Civil war. He says the ceremony gave people a chance to show respect for the stars and stripes, and to give worn flags a proper burial.\n\n\"You're always looking up towards the heavens, and towards the flag saying, 'Hey I respect that you are here for giving the homage that it needs to have,\" said Grant. \"It's a beautiful thing.\"\n\nGrant says around 60 to 70 flags were retired today, and anyone can donate worn flags to any local military branch.", "article_metadata": {"description": "With June 14th known as Flag Day around the U.S., many came to the Panama City Beach Fleet Reserve Association's flag retirement ceremony to show respect for the stars and stripes, and retire worn flags from all across the area.", "language": "english", "author": "Zak Dahlheimer", "og": {"url": "http://www.wjhg.com/home/headlines/Veterans-and-Boy-Scouts-Retire-Dozens-of-Flags-on-Flag-Day-307322441.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/IMG_49651.JPG", "type": "article", "description": "With June 14th known as Flag Day around the U.S., many came to the Panama City Beach Fleet Reserve Association's flag retirement ceremony to show respect for the stars and stripes, and retire worn flags from all across the area.", "title": "Veterans and Boy Scouts Retire Dozens of Flags on Flag Day"}, "twitter": {"description": "With June 14th known as Flag Day around the U.S., many came to the Panama City Beach Fleet Reserve Association's flag retirement ceremony to show respect for the stars and stripes, and retire worn flags from all across the area.", "title": "Veterans and Boy Scouts Retire Dozens of Flags on Flag Day", "url": "http://www.wjhg.com/home/headlines/Veterans-and-Boy-Scouts-Retire-Dozens-of-Flags-on-Flag-Day-307322441.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/IMG_49651.JPG", "creator": "@WJHG_TV", "site": "@WJHG_TV", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "Veterans and Boy Scouts Retire Dozens of Flags on Flag Day", "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "google-site-verification": "orfdzs_E4bRXom1qluA34zerrmjsg4QfrlLSkrR3ZAQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Veterans and Boy Scouts Retire, Dozens of Flags on Flag"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd5f53\"", "article_summary": "Grant says around 60 to 70 flags were retired today, and anyone can donate worn flags to any local military branch.\nAccording to Grant, the current way to properly retire a flag dates back all the way to the Civil war.\nWith June 14th known as Flag Day around the U.S., many came to the Panama City Beach Fleet Reserve Association's flag retirement ceremony to show respect for the stars and stripes, and retire worn flags from all across the area.\n\"I know what it took to defend this flag, and this flag to me is freedom,\" said Grant.\nHe says the ceremony gave people a chance to show respect for the stars and stripes, and to give worn flags a proper burial."}
