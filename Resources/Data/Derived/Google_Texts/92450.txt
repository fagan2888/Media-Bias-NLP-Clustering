Most of us come into contact with plants and shrubbery on a daily basis, whether we live in a big city like New York or a rural area in the Midwest. For the most part, we either don’t notice the vegetation surrounding us or stop to admire its striking beauty. Rarely is our first thought: “Run and hide.”

Now there are certain species of plant out there capable of treating a condition as serious as cancer. There are also species that can kill us in a matter of minutes. The berries, seeds, or leaves, from both house and outdoor plants could be teeming with compounds that result in nausea, vomiting, headaches, irregular heart rhythm, and even death.

In some cases, we don’t even have to come into contact with a poisonous plant for it to kill us. If a cow or other livestock consumes a deadly plant, it can get into their milk and kill the person who drinks it. This used to be called milk sickness and it was fairly common until doctors discovered White Snakeroot to be the cause of most poisonings caused by milk. The plant has since been removed from all areas livestock graze in.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, burning poisonous plants can result in the most severe type of reaction. The smoke from burning toxic foliage can lead to the inhalation of allergens and compounds that cause lung irritation.

Here are 10 species of plants we should be especially cautious of.
