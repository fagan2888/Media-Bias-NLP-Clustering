The defendant\u2019s ex-wife, Phyllis Molinaro, and son, Chris Dunn, told jurors on Monday that Mr. Dunn did not appear drunk and was in good spirits at the wedding.\n\n\u201cHe seemed fine,\u201d Ms. Molinaro said. \u201cHe seemed happy to be there.\u201d\n\nAsked if she had ever seen him impaired in the past, she laughed and said she had.\n\nAccording to the authorities, an argument began after Mr. Dunn told Mr. Davis and his friends to turn down the music they were listening to in an SUV outside the store. One of Mr. Davis\u2019s friends lowered the volume, but Mr. Davis told him to turn it back up.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOfficials say Mr. Dunn became enraged and he and Mr. Davis began arguing. Mr. Dunn, who had a concealed-weapons permit, pulled a 9-millimeter handgun from the glove compartment of his car, according to an affidavit, and fired shots into the Dodge Durango. Nine bullet holes were found in the car.\n\nEmotional testimony came from Mr. Davis\u2019s father, Ronald.\n\nSometimes with tears in his eyes, he said his son\u2019s friends Leland Brunson and Tevin Thompson, both of whom had been in the Durango with Jordan Davis the night he was killed, came to his home in the days after the shooting.\n\n\u201cThey came over to the house, and they talked to me about how they were sorry,\u201d Mr. Davis said. \u201cThe boys were just so sorry that my son was killed, and they were trying to console me.\u201d\n\nProsecutors rested their case after an associate medical examiner testified that the first bullet that hit Mr. Davis in the abdomen most likely killed him. The bullet went from his lower right abdomen, into his diaphragm, through his liver and hit his aorta, said Stacey Simons, the associate medical examiner.\n\n\u201cI believe it would have been fatal within a matter of minutes,\u201d Ms. Simons said.\n\nAt the end of the day, Mr. Dunn\u2019s lawyer, Cory Strolla, told the judge he expected to call only one or two more witnesses on Tuesday before wrapping up the defense.\n\nUnder cross-examination, Ms. Simons said it was unlikely that Mr. Davis was standing up when he was shot. Mr. Strolla had argued that Mr. Davis had threatened Mr. Dunn with a four-inch knife. Ms. Simons said the bullet appeared to have struck something hard, like a car door, before hitting Mr. Davis.\n\nSukhan Warf, an analyst for the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, said toxicology tests on Mr. Davis showed no signs of drugs or alcohol in his body. No gun was found in the SUV.\n\nMr. Strolla called several friends and a co-worker of Mr. Dunn\u2019s to the stand. They testified that they had never seen him get angry, and that he had been something of a peacekeeper.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBeverly Berry, who with her husband met Mr. Dunn through Mr. Dunn\u2019s parents and often socialized with him, said he they had not seen him get angry.\n\n\u201cNever have I observed anything other than a very calm demeanor,\u201d she said.\n\nAnother Law Enforcement Department analyst, Maria Pagan, testified earlier in the day about the steps Mr. Dunn took before shooting the teenager, bolstering the prosecution\u2019s contention that he acted with premeditation.\n\nMr. Dunn would have had to remove the gun from its holster, load the chamber and then apply six pounds of pressure to fire, Ms. Pagan said.\n\nHe fired the gun 10 times, hitting the SUV nine times, and he would have had to pull the trigger every time using more than six pounds of pressure each time, Ms. Pagan said.\n\nMs. Pagan answered affirmatively when the prosecutor, Angela Corey, asked, \u201cDoes that take a conscious effort of the shooter to have a second round come out?\u201d\n\nIn continuing to talk about his son\u2019s friends visit to his home, Ronald Davis said Leland Brunson, Jordan Davis\u2019s best friend, was crying uncontrollably.\n\n\u201cHe was going back and forth from the living room to bedroom and sitting on the bed, then came back to the living room,\u201d Ronald Davis said. \u201cTevin Thompson was crying. He usually has a big smile on his face.\u201d\n\nMr. Davis said he has little recollection of the visit because of his own emotional agony.\n\n\u201cI think I said at the time that I was shocked that my son was killed,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140210225122, "twitter": {"description": "The defendant, Michael Dunn, has said he acted in self-defense when he fatally shot Jordan Davis, 17, of Marietta, Ga., in November 2012 outside a Jacksonville convenience store.", "title": "Man in Murder Case Called Nonviolent", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/11/us/man-in-murder-case-called-nonviolent.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002702536"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/02/11/us/DUNN/DUNN-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/11/us/man-in-murder-case-called-nonviolent.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002702536", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/11/us/man-in-murder-case-called-nonviolent.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us", "hdl_p": "Man in Murder Case Called Nonviolent", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Feb. 10, 2014", "edt": "NewYork", "keywords": "Dunn  Michael David,Davis  Jordan Russell (1995-2012),Jacksonville (Fla),Murders and Attempted Murders", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "The Associated Press", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/02/11/us/DUNN/DUNN-thumbLarge.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Davis, Jordan Russell (1995-2012)", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "The defendant, Michael Dunn, has said he acted in self-defense when he fatally shot Jordan Davis, 17, of Marietta, Ga., in November 2012 outside a Jacksonville convenience store.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/02/11/us/DUNN/DUNN-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "The defendant, Michael Dunn, has said he acted in self-defense when he fatally shot Jordan Davis, 17, of Marietta, Ga., in November 2012 outside a Jacksonville convenience store.", "CG": "us", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Feb. 10, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/national/index.html", "section": "U.S.", "modified": "2014-03-20", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp", "tag": "Murders and Attempted Murders", "published": "2014-02-10", "section-taxonomy-id": "23FD6C8B-62D5-4CEA-A331-6C2A9A1223BE"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "geo": "Jacksonville (Fla)", "slug": "11dunn", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20140320175019, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/11/us/man-in-murder-case-called-nonviolent.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/02/11/us/DUNN/DUNN-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The defendant, Michael Dunn, has said he acted in self-defense when he fatally shot Jordan Davis, 17, of Marietta, Ga., in November 2012 outside a Jacksonville convenience store.", "title": "Man in Murder Case Called Nonviolent"}, "pdate": 20140210, "des": "Murders and Attempted Murders", "articleid": 100000002702536, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Man in Murder Case Called Nonviolent", "PST": "News"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce2c1\"", "article_summary": "Advertisement Continue reading the main storyOfficials say Mr. Dunn became enraged and he and Mr. Davis began arguing.\nMr. Strolla had argued that Mr. Davis had threatened Mr. Dunn with a four-inch knife.\nOne of Mr. Davis\u2019s friends lowered the volume, but Mr. Davis told him to turn it back up.\nThe defendant\u2019s ex-wife, Phyllis Molinaro, and son, Chris Dunn, told jurors on Monday that Mr. Dunn did not appear drunk and was in good spirits at the wedding.\nMr. Dunn, 47, had been at his son\u2019s wedding before he pulled up to the convenience store where Mr. Davis was with his friends."}
