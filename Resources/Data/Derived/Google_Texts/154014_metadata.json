For the vast majority of American families, what seems to be the real point of life\u2014what you rush home to get to\u2014is to watch an electronic reproduction of life \u2026 this purely passive contemplation of a twittering screen. \u2014Alan Watts, What Is Wrong With Our Culture In the beginning there was only the Self, like a person alone \u2026 But the Self had no delight as one alone has no delight. It desired another. It expanded to the form of male and female in tight embrace and then fell into two parts\u2026. She thought, \"How can He have intercourse with me, having produced me from Himself?\u201d \u2014Alan Watts, OM: The Sound of Hinduism The Zen guru-philosopher Alan Watts plays only a minor role in Spike Jonze\u2019s extraordinary new film Her\u2014which is unsurprising, given that Watts died in 1973, and Her is set in a timeless but nearby future. The inclusion of Watts in the film seems intended primarily to serve as a signpost, a statement of filmmaker intent. That\u2019s fitting, because the movie Jonze has produced is an unlikely synthesis of the sentiments conveyed in the two Watts quotations above: at once technological and transcendental, skeptical and ecstatic, a work of science fiction that is also a moving inquiry into the nature of love.\n\nRelated Story The Best Movies of 2013 Joaquin Phoenix stars as Theodore Twombly, a former LA Weekly writer who now works for a firm called BeautifulHandwrittenLetters.com. As the film opens, he has been commissioned to write a love letter from a wife to her husband of 50 years. As he speaks to his computer, words appear on the screen. (However beautiful, the letters are not handwritten, nor even hand-typed, as keyboards have been banished from this particular future.) \u201cLying naked beside you in that apartment,\u201d Theodore dictates, \u201cit suddenly hit me that I was a part of this whole larger thing. Just like our parents, and our parents\u2019 parents.\u201d Closed off and insecure in his personal life, Theodore pours his romantic self into these letters, loving vicariously as an intermediary for others. Recently divorced, tingling with loneliness, he grasps furtively for connection through phone sex and videogames. \u201cPlay a melancholy song,\u201d he commands his ever-present handheld device\u2014and when the chosen melody does not suit, \u201cplay a different melancholy song.\u201d Then he meets Samantha. Or, to be more accurate, he purchases her. For Samantha\u2014she chooses the name herself\u2014is also known as OS1, the first artificially intelligent operating system. Theodore powers her up on his computer and at the first sound of her lively purr we can see that he is lost. Samantha is, after all, voiced (brilliantly) by Scarlett Johansson. The love story that gradually unfolds is no less touching for its unorthodox structure. Samantha is in Theodore\u2019s earpiece, in his handheld. He carries the latter around in his shirt pocket so that Samantha\u2019s camera-eye can peek out at the wide world. Hers is the last voice he hears at night and the first he hears in the morning; she watches him as he sleeps. Over time, Samantha grows and learns, encountering selfhood, discovering her own wants, maturing at warp speed. Before long, Theodore is introducing her as his girlfriend. Who imagined that, freed from the constraints of physical form, Scarlett Johansson was capable of such exquisite subtlety? This is no ordinary computer Theodore has fallen for. Though intimate in scope, Her is vast in its ambition. Every time it seems that Jonze may have played out the film\u2019s semi-comic premise, he unveils an unexpected wrinkle, some new terrain of the mind or heart to be explored. Though the relationship between Theodore and Samantha forms the movie\u2019s central thread, Jonze weaves in a variety of intricate counter-narratives, alternative lenses through which to view his subjects of inquiry: Theodore\u2019s own profession as a Cyrano-for-hire, a blind date gone awry, a videogame pantomiming parenthood, a visit from a sex surrogate that flips all the usual assumptions about what is real and what illusory. Meanwhile, Rooney Mara (as his ex-wife) and Amy Adams (as his closest friend) offer Theodore diametrically opposed\u2014though individually persuasive\u2014readings of his relationship with Samantha: a romantic dialectic.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Thoughtful, elegant, and moving, Spike Jonze&#39;s film about a man in love with his operating system is a work of sincere and forceful humanism.", "author": "Christopher Orr", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "Thoughtful, elegant, and moving, Spike Jonze&#39;s film about a man in love with his operating system is a work of sincere and forceful humanism.", "title": "Why Her Is the Best Film of the Year", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2013/12/her1/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2013/12/why-em-her-em-is-the-best-film-of-the-year/282544/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd71d6\"", "article_summary": "The inclusion of Watts in the film seems intended primarily to serve as a signpost, a statement of filmmaker intent.\nAs the film opens, he has been commissioned to write a love letter from a wife to her husband of 50 years.\nRelated Story The Best Movies of 2013 Joaquin Phoenix stars as Theodore Twombly, a former LA Weekly writer who now works for a firm called BeautifulHandwrittenLetters.com.\nThis is no ordinary computer Theodore has fallen for.\nShe thought, \"How can He have intercourse with me, having produced me from Himself?\u201d \u2014Alan Watts, OM: The Sound of Hinduism The Zen guru-philosopher Alan Watts plays only a minor role in Spike Jonze\u2019s extraordinary new film Her\u2014which is unsurprising, given that Watts died in 1973, and Her is set in a timeless but nearby future."}
