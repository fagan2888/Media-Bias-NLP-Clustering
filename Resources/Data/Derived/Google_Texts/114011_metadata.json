Mark Wilson/Getty Images\n\nHouse Republicans approved a vote to freeze Planned Parenthood\u2019s federal funding for one year on Friday, The Hill reported \u2014 it\u2019s reportedly the first time it's ever approved such a measure.\n\nThe proposed year-long block is so Congress has time to \u201cfully investigate claims of wrongdoing by the provider,\u201d in which the wrongdoing refers to the organization\u2019s use of aborted fetal tissue. U.S. representative Keith Rothfus (R-Pa.) said that what we've recently learned about the organization is \"appalling, barbaric and indefensible.\u201d And since Republicans anticipate Democrats will block the bill, representative Bill Flores (R-TX) suggested that even stronger action should be taken in order \u201cto stop the murders.\u201d\n\nShortly after the news broke, Planned Parenthood supporters took to social media, namely Twitter; there, users used the hashtag #IStandWithPP to explain how passing a bill like this hurts women's health. Soon enough the hashtag was trending number one in the U.S.\n\nblocking access to abortions will not make them go away. will only force people to use unsafe methods & endanger their lives #IStandWithPP \u2014 abby saul (@abbysaul) September 19, 2015\n\nA woman with a reproductive issue could easily go broke after co-pays, follow-ups, tests, ultrasounds, etc., #IStandWithPP \u2014 Akilah Hughes (@AkilahObviously) September 18, 2015\n\nI used to go to Planned Parenthood for screenings too - it\u2019s not just for women. #IStandWithPP \u2014 Toby Muresianu (@tobymuresianu) September 19, 2015\n\n#IStandWithPP because when I was in foster care as a teen, they were the only ones to give us health exams, education & care. Grateful. \u2014 Juanita Chang (@juanitachang) September 18, 2015\n\nDefunding PP when you don't approve of abortions is like closing McDonald's cuz you hate apples and they sometimes sell apples #IStandWithPP \u2014 Jimmy Wahl (@JimmyWahl) September 19, 2015\n\nThe bill to defund Planned Parenthood's funding wasn't the only one that was approved. The Hill added that a second bill was passed to tighten restrictions on abortion doctors, which Eric Ferrero, the vice president of communications for Planned Parenthood Action Fund, said is just another \"callous attempt to insert politics into women's health.\"\n\nDemocrats are in agreement with Ferrero, especially when considering low-income women.\n\n\"Most patients served by Planned Parenthood have incomes that are at or below 150 percent of the federal poverty line,\" rep. Joe Kennedy (D-MA) said. \u201cIf we pass this bill, we are turning our backs on those patients. We are telling low-income families in every corner of this country that we count their health and happiness less.\u201d\n\nThat said, Alan Fram and Andrew Taylor of the Associated Press found that these bills stand little chance of enactment. House Democrats have enough votes to block them, though if they didn't, the White House has apparently already promised a veto.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "house, republicans, vote, defund, planned, parenthood, effect, it, has, womens, health, care", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Twitter users show Planned Parenthood an outpouring of support after House Republicans vote to freeze the organization's funding for a year.", "title": "#IStandWithPP Trends After House Votes To Defund Planned Parenthood", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/house-republicans-vote-defund-planned-parenthood-effect-it-has-womens-health-care-353344", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/09/19/planned-parenthood.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Twitter users show Planned Parenthood an outpouring of support after House Republicans vote to freeze the organization's funding for a year.", "title": "#IStandWithPP Trends After House Votes To Defund Planned Parenthood", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/house-republicans-vote-defund-planned-parenthood-effect-it-has-womens-health-care-353344", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/09/19/planned-parenthood.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/09/19/planned-parenthood.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Hill", "published_time": "2015-09-19T13:12:33-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-19T17:55:16-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Twitter users show Planned Parenthood an outpouring of support after House Republicans vote to freeze the organization's funding for a year."}, "article_summary": "\"Most patients served by Planned Parenthood have incomes that are at or below 150 percent of the federal poverty line,\" rep.
