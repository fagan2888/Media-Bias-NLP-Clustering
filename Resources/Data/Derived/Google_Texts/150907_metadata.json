But they don\u2019t apply to the government.\n\nConservatives often argue that the federal government should function more like a private business. Obamacare supporters should be grateful it does not, because otherwise HealthCare.gov would almost certainly run afoul of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), as well as of the recently established Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).\n\nOrson Swindle, who served as an FTC commissioner from 1997 to 2005, says there are a number of practices that, if HealthCare.gov were a private entity, would result in its being \u201ctaken to the shed and horsewhipped\u201d by government regulators.\n\nPresident Obama\u2019s oft-repeated falsehood, \u201cIf you like your plan, you can keep your plan\u201d \u2014 something the administration knew was untrue \u2014 would almost certainly be a textbook case of deceptive advertising, punishable under Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, which prohibits \u201cunfair or deceptive acts or practice in or affecting commerce.\u201d This includes a \u201crepresentation, omission or practice that is likely to mislead the consumer,\u201d such that the consumer would be \u201clikely to have chosen differently but for the deception.\u201d\n\nOther examples of potentially deceptive practices include the apparently deliberate decision to withhold information from HealthCare.gov visitors as to the actual prices of the policies offered via the exchanges. In fact, users aren\u2019t told how much those policies will cost until after they have created an account, which requires giving a slew of personal and financial information.\n\nAdditionally, a recent CBS News investigation found that HealthCare.gov contains a pricing feature that tends to \u201cdramatically underestimate\u201d the cost of insurance. The website\u2019s \u201cshop and browse\u201d feature divides users into two broad age categories: \u201c49 or under\u201d and \u201c50 or older.\u201d Price estimates for the first age group are based on what a 27-year-old could expect to pay, whereas as the latter group\u2019s price estimates are based on what a 50-year-old would pay, a practice that inevitably produces wildly misleading results for individuals significantly older than the base age. In some cases, actual premiums are nearly double the projected amount. In the words of one industry expert, the feature is \u201cincredibly misleading for people that are trying to get a sense of what they\u2019re paying.\u201d\n\nThe FTC requires companies to provide essentially every possible form of information about a given product up front, prior to the point of purchase.
