But John R. Anderson is no longer taking chances with his bottom line. The fourth-generation rancher is exploring alternative incomes to ensure his business can survive another hit from Mother Nature, including leasing part of his land for quail, deer and antelope hunting.\n\n\u201cThe drought opened our eyes to we need to be more diverse,\u201d said Anderson, who ranches near Gail, about 70 miles south of Lubbock. \u201cOur mind isn\u2019t closed. If there\u2019s something we can do we\u2019re going to go for it, if it makes economic sense.\u201d\n\nHis counterparts in the nation\u2019s top beef-producing state are doing everything they can to make up for the smaller profits since the drought, which began in early 2011, forced a widespread culling of herds. Though limited supplies have prompted a record rise in beef prices, more ranchers are leasing part of their property for hunting or selling water to oil companies or desert plants and mistletoe to nurseries. Some are even taking side jobs to make ends meet.\n\nThe changes may be permanent, and the ongoing drought is among the main factors that have indelibly altered the state\u2019s centuries-old cattle ranching tradition, says Texas and Southwestern Cattle Raisers Association vice president Richard Thorpe.\n\nHunting leases are perhaps the most popular way ranchers have diversified their incomes. Anderson will lease his land for as much as $5 an acre; other places charge thousands of dollars per gun.\n\nFrom the beginning of the drought through last year, the amount of land designated for hunting- and wildlife-management use increased by about a third to 4.1 million acres. The extra income offers financial stability to ranchers who have not yet fully replenished their numbers \u2014 down about 18 percent from 13.3 million cattle in Texas and at the lowest point nationally since the early 1950s.\n\nSeveral months after becoming a partial owner of the Bar L Ranch with her fiance two years ago in North Texas, Mandy Dauses realized the profit margins were thinner than she expected, due in part to having a smaller herd that was culled by nearly three-quarters. She now works full-time at a veterinarian\u2019s clinic and spends nights and weekends tending to the ranch, catching stray cattle and custom-baling hay for extra income.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Texas ranchers seeking alternative incomes", "title": "Texas ranchers seeking alternative incomes", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Texas ranchers seeking alternative incomes", "title": "Texas ranchers seeking alternative incomes", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/12/20/texas_ranchers_seeking_alternative_incomes/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/food-and-farm-resourceful-ranchers.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Texas ranchers seeking alternative incomes", "title": "Texas ranchers seeking alternative incomes", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/food-and-farm-resourceful-ranchers.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Betsy Blaney and Emily Schmall", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Three years later, the sprawling 33,000-acre West Texas ranch is again populated with cattle, thanks to improved rainfall.\nHunting leases are perhaps the most popular way ranchers have diversified their incomes.\nThe fourth-generation rancher is exploring alternative incomes to ensure his business can survive another hit from Mother Nature, including leasing part of his land for quail, deer and antelope hunting.\nAnderson will lease his land for as much as $5 an acre; other places charge thousands of dollars per gun.\nBut John R.
