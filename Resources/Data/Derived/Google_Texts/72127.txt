BOISE, Idaho (KBOI) -- Maximus in Boise said Monday that it plans to eliminate 1,600 workers in the Treasure Valley.



The call center has been housing phone calls related to the Affordable Care Act.



"The reduction in staffing is based on the nature of the contract and the reduced volume of calls, both of which are directly related to the enrollment period under the Affordable Care Act," a letter to employees states.



The company says it plans to eliminate the positions April 25.



"Given the number of employees who must be let go, it is reasonable to expect your position ... to be eliminated," the letter states.



Several resturants and businesses just blocks away from the call center are worried what impact it could have on business.

Guido's pizza is just one of the shops that relys on a boost from a lunch, and occational dinner rush. Some employees also worry not only about the bottom line for the store, but the possible decline in tips as well.

Willi B's Saloon is in the same strip mall and also worries about a decline in sales. While the owner said they do get some extra business from lunch most of their extra sales come from a boost at happy hour when workers end their day.

"Lunch will be effected by it for sure I mean we get a little from the campus over there, but happy hour is definitely a busy point for our business," said Sarah Stephens who co-owns the business.
