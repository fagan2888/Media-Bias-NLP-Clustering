The campaign of U.S. Senate Republican candidate Thom Tillis is pointing to a new report about the rising costs of health insurance premiums since the Affordable Care Act started.

Forbes says the law requiring everyone to have health insurance is causing premiums to rise for most people. It has a new article and interactive map out detailing the study.

Rates in Buncombe, according to Forbes, are up 130 percent for 40-year-olds.

But premiums have been on the rise since 1999, well before Obamacare started, according to the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation.

The Tillis campaign fired at Democratic incumbent U.S. Sen. Kay Hagan's support of the law in a statement about the Forbes report.

She said in a visit to Asheville in April she supports the law and that it has helped millions get health insurance.

Tillis opposes the law.

"Despite the skyrocketing premiums and the nearly half a million cancellation notices received by North Carolinians, Kay Hagan has no regrets and even says she would vote for ObamaCare again if given another chance," said Tillis spokesman Daniel Keylin.

Hagan's campaign said she supports changes to make the law better. It pointed to several reports, including this one on MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show, that refute the idea the Affordable Care Act is to blame for rising premiums.

The Forbes report does not include the benefit of tax credits, the Hagan campaign noted.

"Kay has always supported commonsense fixes to the Affordable Care Act, including cosponsoring a bill to let North Carolinians keep their plans permanently," said Hagan spokesman Chris Hayden. "On the other hand, Thom Tillis wants to take us back to a time when insurance companies could discriminate against people with preexisting conditions, charge women more for care and make seniors pay more for prescription drugs."
