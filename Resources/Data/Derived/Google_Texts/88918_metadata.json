Image Credit: Washington Post\n\nDANVILLE, Pasadena: At Geisinger Health System in Pennsylvania, hospital officials want to keep their customers happy.\n\nSo when patients are upset about a long wait in the emergency department, or a doctor\u2019s brusque manner, or a meal that never arrived in a room, Geisinger is doing more than apologising.\n\nIt\u2019s offering money back on their care, no questions asked.\n\nThe hospital system is the first in the country to adopt what has long been a basic tenet of retail business: customer refunds. This focus on customer satisfaction is a relatively new concept for health care, in which doctors have typically called the shots. And it\u2019s one that Geisinger\u2019s staff questioned when president and chief executive David Feinberg came up with the refund idea last fall.\n\nBut the novel approach is in keeping with health care\u2019s shift to improve the experience of patients. Under the Affordable Care Act, government payments are increasingly tied to the quality of care and patient satisfaction as opposed to the quantity of services provided.\n\n\u201cWe want to make sure we not only have the right care that is high quality and safe, but we also want to make sure our care is compassionate, dignified and delivered with a lot of kindness,\u201d said Feinberg, who took over Geisinger last May after running the UCLA health system.\n\nOne 49-year-old patient received a $210 (Dh771) refund in February after an appointment left her in tears. \u201cPt. felt like they didn\u2019t care and did not have her best interest at heart. Pt. stated she came to Geisinger b/c she trusted us, she has no trust now,\u201d according to the financial authorisation for the refund.\n\nKaren Hull was upset, too, and not just over the chicken panini that took hours to be delivered after her successful surgery in January. Several weeks earlier, the Geisinger Medical Center finance department had blindsided the 46-year-old dental hygienist with a call for a \u201cdown payment\u201d on her operation, for a herniated disk that had caused crippling pain.\n\n\u201cI remember thinking, it\u2019s not like I\u2019m going to skip out on my back surgery,\u201d she said. She wound up paying $100 toward her $2,375 co-payment.\n\nAfter she got home, she asked for a $150 refund \u2014 an amount that reflected her distress.\n\nHers was among the 74 requests that Geisinger received between October and mid-March. In response to those requests, the system refunded or waived charges of nearly $80,000, officials said. Only co-payments and deductibles can be considered.\n\nWhen Feinberg announced the program, which began as a pilot and then was expanded to all patients systemwide in early April, other industry executives told him it was \u201ca dumb idea,\u201d he said. But there is less scepticism now given how the feedback already has boosted patient satisfaction scores, a key metric the federal government uses to pay hospitals.\n\nIndustry executives at a recent health-plan meeting were \u201cblown away\u201d after hearing the CEO\u2019s presentation, recalled Ceci Connolly, president and chief executive of the Alliance of Community Health Plans. The organisation represents 22 health plans and provider groups, including Geisinger.\n\n\u201cIt is sad and ironic that a business that has decided to listen to its customers and be responsive and even occasionally refund some money is considered so out of the box,\u201d Connolly said.\n\nAt least one other system \u2014 University of Utah Health Care \u2014 is looking into a similar program.\n\nIn recent years, hospitals nationwide have sought to make care more customer-friendly, with staff retraining and new programs. Yet Geisinger\u2019s move is perhaps the boldest innovation by a system long known for reinventing medical care. A decade ago, for example, Geisinger introduced a 90-day warranty for surgery patients.\n\nIts size and its integration of hospitals, doctor practices and insurance helps to make that possible. It is one of the country\u2019s largest health systems, with 10 hospitals serving more than 3 million residents in Pennsylvania and southern New Jersey, and it claims more than 500,000 members in a health coverage plan it offers. The refund program is in place only at the Pennsylvania facilities. \u201cThey can make the math work,\u201d compensating for short-term losses on refunds through longer-term relationships with the insurance customers, Connolly said.\n\nSceptics\u2019 worries that greedy patients would abuse the system and cite any reason in demanding money back have not proved warranted. And Feinberg maintains that the refund process provides Geisinger with valuable information, spotlighting areas that need improvement. The amounts, which are limited to a patient\u2019s maximum co-pay or deductible, have ranged from $20 to a few thousand dollars.\n\n\u201cWe have a built-in secret-shopper program, and the patient is telling us when we get it right,\u201d he said. Most feedback has been positive. Refunds represent \u201cfamilies who had to wait in the emergency room for too long, or were treated by a doctor in an abrupt manner, or the nurse got too caught up in what she was doing and forgot to hold someone\u2019s hand,\u201d he said.\n\nMaureen Bisognano, president emeriti at the non-profit Institute for Healthcare Improvement, agrees.\n\n\u201cIf you went out to get a consultant to teach you how to improve patient experience, it would be a lot more than [$80,000],\u201d she said. Plus, the system\u2019s approach gives it real-time feedback \u201cright at the moment of care about what needs to be fixed.\u201d Most important, she said, it sends a message to patients that Geisinger trusts them.\n\nProvenExperience, as the program is called, allows patients to get refunds in a variety of ways. The quickest is through a specially designed mobile app \u2014 a free one \u2014 on which patients can rate their experience and put in for a refund for services that took place beginning last November. Requests are typically processed in three to five business days.\n\nAt the same time, any of Geisinger\u2019s 30,000 employees can reach out to patients who feel their service or experience is \u201cnot good.\u201d Employees can provide \u201cservice recovery\u201d with free lunch or dinner vouchers, parking passes or gift certificates for the hospital gift shop. That is also how the system deals with unhappy Medicare patients. The uninsured can get financial credit on a case-by-case basis, officials said.\n\nThough the ultimate goal is to improve patient experience, \u201cthe money piece gives us skin in the game,\u201d said neurosurgeon Jonathan Slotkin, who helped design the program.\n\nThe top refund requests reflect issues common to many hospitals, including complaints about poor communication with the staff, parking, noisy hospital rooms and billing issues. Some requests come directly from Feinberg, who visits regularly with patients throughout the system and jots down his cell phone number when he hands out his business card.\n\nFeinberg said Geisinger is already making improvements, starting with a new corporate chef to come up with better menus at each hospital. Other changes will take a bit longer. To address emergency-room backlogs, he is working on a plan to eliminate all wait times within three years. That may involve new online registration and ER waiting rooms that could be turned into clinical space where doctors would treat non-emergency patients.\n\nTo improve communication, all employees are getting new training to ensure they always introduce themselves to patients, ask permission before performing procedures and tell patients what is coming next.\n\nWithin Geisinger, some staffers are afraid that there will be repercussions if a patient wants money back. \u201cIf a patient of mine asks for a refund, does that reflect I am a poor-quality physician? I have those own internal fears myself,\u201d Slotkin said.\n\nAt a more fundamental level, he said, it is a cultural change for doctors who were trained to treat relationships with patients as \u201csacrosanct and precious\u201d \u2014 and certainly different from selling shoes or sofas. \u201cPeople don\u2019t respond to change well,\u201d said Anthony Petrick, who heads bariatric surgery at Geisinger.\n\nBut he and others said they also understand that as patients pay an ever-greater share of the cost of their care, hospitals need to understand that they are customers who must be treated with dignity and respect.\n\nKim Walsh didn\u2019t even know she could get money back. The pharmacist, 51, had undergone thyroid surgery in December. The operation was successful, but her stay was calamitous.\n\nAt Geisinger\u2019s Wyoming Valley Medical Center in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, Walsh was assigned a room with no toilet. She had to use a public bathroom, which meant asking staff for help to get out of bed and walk down a long hallway. She remembers one particularly rude aide. On her last trip, there was urine on the seat and no toilet paper. She called her husband in tears.\n\nThe hospital\u2019s patient-advocate representative was appalled and assured Walsh she wouldn\u2019t have to pay the remaining $785 of her deductible. Walsh hopes hospital staffers have learnt an important lesson.\n\n\u201cI would have rather been treated well and paid my 800 bucks,\u201d she said.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Pennsylvania hospitals are doing something shocking  giving refunds to unhappy patients", "application-name": "GulfNews", "author": "WP", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://static.gulfnews.com/media/new/img/generic/mstile-310x150.png", "twitter": {"site": "@gulf_news", "image": {"src": "http://static.gulfnews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1714681!/image/1754983064.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_460346/1754983064.jpg"}, "description": "Pennsylvania hospitals are doing something shocking  giving refunds to unhappy patients", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Not happy with our care?
