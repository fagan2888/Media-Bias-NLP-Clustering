The Boys and Girls Club held its annual banquet Saturday evening at the Frank Cochran Center.

About a thousand people showed up for a fundraiser event aimed at raising money for the Boys and Girls Club. Executive Director Ricky Hood says each year, this banquet brings in much-needed funds and serves as a reminder to the public just how important this organization is to the community.

"Well, the funds raised here give us the opportunity to raise the funds necessary for us to be able to serve the kids we do on an annual basis," he says.

Hood says the Boys and Girls Club is excited and looking forward to another productive year.
