Jerry Brown signed the End of Life Option Act on Monday.\n\nBut the law still leaves out a wide range of people who might want to be covered: people with progressive debilitating diseases that don\u2019t have an obvious six-months-to-live prognosis and people with dementia, the fastest-growing health threat in the U.S. That\u2019s also true of similar laws in Oregon, Washington, Montana and Vermont.\n\nAnd there might be no good way around this.\n\nThese restrictions might be necessary at this point in the history of aid in dying in this country, according to Judith Schwarz of the advocacy group End of Life Choices New York. \u201cOpponents have many fears that such laws will be misapplied to the disenfranchised,\u201d she wrote in an email, and it\u2019s important to guarantee that for these groups \u2014 the poor, the elderly, the isolated \u2014 the \u201cright to die\u201d doesn\u2019t somehow morph into the duty to die \u201cfor the sake of others.\u201d\n\nStill, there\u2019s a problem with limiting the death-with-dignity option only to those with a prognosis of fewer than six months. For one thing, prognosis is difficult, and studies show that doctors are actually overoptimistic in their assessment of how long their patients have to live. \u201cSome doctors may wish to be more compassionate and not be as specific,\u201d Janis Landis, president of the Final Exit Network, wrote in an email, \u201cand ironically thus deny the patient the certification that is required.\u201d\n\nAnd then there are the conditions that are completely unpredictable, not only in terms of life expectancy but in terms of how, when and in what order functions will be lost. This includes progressive neurological diseases like multiple sclerosis and ALS, where those who want to avoid the most debilitating final stages might end their lives prematurely, afraid that their ability to swallow a pill might disappear without warning.\n\n\u201cFear of this actually drives some individuals to act early, while they can still procure the equipment they need,\u201d Landis wrote. To her, it seems especially harsh \u201cto force such a cruel choice on an individual already suffering so greatly.\u201d\n\nAs fraught as it is, though, the requirement that a person be able to swallow lethal medication on his own is an important safeguard, according to Mickey MacIntyre, the chief strategic officer of Compassion & Choices. \u201cThis self-administration requirement is a critical distinction between medical aid in dying and euthanasia,\u201d he wrote in an email.\n\n\u201cUnlike medical aid in dying, euthanasia requires a healthcare professional or someone else, not the individual, to administer the medication,\u201d he added, \u201cSo the individual loses control of the decision.\u201d\n\nMacIntyre pointed out that people often change their minds at the last minute, and have every right to do so. In Oregon, he noted, about one-third of the people who obtained lethal drugs through the state\u2019s death-with-dignity program since 1998 ultimately decided not to take them.\n\nThis seems to be a distinctly American quandary, though. In other countries, such as Belgium and the Netherlands, there are also safeguards written into their right-to-die laws, but they are broader and more inclusive.\n\n\u201cThe European safeguard is \u2018intolerable suffering,\u2019 \u201d said Margaret Pabst Battin, a bioethicist at the University of Utah. \u201cIt\u2019s not defined in terms of the time until death, and it does include people with ALS or other conditions that wouldn\u2019t fall under our laws, which don\u2019t say anything about suffering.\u201d\n\nBattin experienced the complexities of deciding when suffering becomes unbearable in caring for her husband, Brooke Hopkins, who was paralyzed from the shoulders down in a 2008 bicycle crash and lived for five more years, until he finally decided in 2013 to withdraw the machinery keeping him alive.\n\nEarlier this year, the Supreme Court of Canada used European-style language upholding the right to die for anyone with \u201ca grievous and irremediable medical condition \u2026 that causes enduring suffering that is intolerable.\u201d\n\nA death-with-dignity bill introduced in Battin\u2019s own state tried to broaden the safeguards to include people with a wider range of illnesses. On the phone with me, Battin read aloud from the Utah Death with Dignity Act, introduced by Rep. Rebecca Chavez-Houk, which could apply to someone with an \u201cintractable and unbearable illness,\u201d defined as \u201cbodily disorder that cannot be cured or successfully palliated, and that causes such severe suffering that a patient prefers death.\u201d She said such broad language would no doubt be changed if the bill works its way through the state Legislature, as has happened elsewhere.\n\nBut people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease and other forms of dementia are beyond the scope of almost all these laws.\n\nSchwarz said that maybe, very far in the future, there might be some way to cover dementia, but it\u2019s \u201cso complicated\u201d that she doesn\u2019t see it happening anytime soon. How, for instance, do you write legislation to deal with the question of personhood, which alters as the disease progresses? Is the demented individual \u2014 perhaps someone relatively content in her diminishment \u2014 \u201cthe same as the individual who so FIRMLY REQUESTED/DEMANDED lethal meds at a certain point in their future demented state?\u201d Schwarz wondered. \u201cAnd who are you going to get to administer lethal meds under such circumstances?\u201d\n\nSchwarz spends a lot of time these days with Alzheimer\u2019s patients who want to choose the timing of their deaths. She said all she can offer them is guidance about stopping eating and drinking as a way to hasten the end.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very, very hard choice to make when life still has pleasure & purpose,\u201d she wrote. But \u201cthe window can close\u201d on a person with dementia, affecting the ability to refuse food and water once that person can no longer feed herself and caregivers enter into the decision.\n\nThis means that a self-directed death for someone with dementia might always have to mean saying farewell to life a bit sooner than she might have otherwise chosen.", "article_metadata": {"description": "People with uncertain prognoses or dementia can't end their lives under California's new medical aid in dying law.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Despite Sweeping 'Death-With-Dignity' Law, Few Will Have That Option\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2015\\/10\\/08\\/despite-sweeping-death-with-dignity-law-few-will-have-that-option\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-10-08 09:23:52\",\"mod_date\":\"2015-10-08 09:23:52\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":90618,\"author_id\":\"8344\",\"author_name\":\"State of Health\",\"author_display_name\":\"State of Health\",\"tags\":[\"Aid in Dying\",\"News\",\"Physician-assisted Suicide\"],\"categories\":[\"Policy\",\"Tests &amp; Treatments\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2015\\/10\\/end-of-life-cae7dd97f57d20828b15bae1f58541c6efa878ee-e1444321218461.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "People with uncertain prognoses or dementia can't end their lives under California's new medical aid in dying law.", "title": "Despite Sweeping \u2018Death-With-Dignity\u2019 Law, Few Will Have That Option", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2015/10/08/despite-sweeping-death-with-dignity-law-few-will-have-that-option/", "image": "http://www.google-analytics.com/__utm.gif?utmac=UA-5828686-4&utmdt=Despite+Sweeping+Death-With-Dignity+Law%2C+Few+Will+Have+That+Option&utme=8(APIKey)9(MDAxOTAwOTE4MDEyMTkxMDAzNjczZDljZA004)", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "aid in dying,news,physician-assisted suicide", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The death-with-dignity movement took a giant step forward this week, with 38 million people coming under its umbrella in a single swoop when California Gov.\nIn Oregon, he noted, about one-third of the people who obtained lethal drugs through the state\u2019s death-with-dignity program since 1998 ultimately decided not to take them.\nJerry Brown signed the End of Life Option Act on Monday.\nBut people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease and other forms of dementia are beyond the scope of almost all these laws.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very, very hard choice to make when life still has pleasure & purpose,\u201d she wrote."}
