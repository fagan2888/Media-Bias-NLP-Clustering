Philadelphians can add one more company to the stuffed buffet table of food delivery services in the city.

Menu123, based in Blue Bell, has launched and will offer delivery to homes and businesses from more than 1,300 restaurants in Montgomery County and Center City, reported the Philadelphia Business Journal.

Amada, HipCityVeg and Federal Donuts are among the popular eateries available. The service targets restaurants that don't normally deliver, and it sets itself apart from the competition by also acting as a marketing firm.

Customers can order online at menu123.com (no mobile app yet) and sort restaurants by genre, cost and Google review rating. Each restaurant description states the approximate delivery time and whether there is a delivery fee or minimum order number, although the website itself is free to use.

"Right now we are using Montgomery County to test our service's demand," CEO Lina Shenk told the Philadelphia Business Journal.

If the company can compete with the likes of GrubHub, Instacart and Caviar, it will expand to the other suburbs as well. In addition, the service is available in Trenton and parts of New York City.
