A fight at a Colorado Springs 7-Eleven escalated after one of the men involved threatened to kill everyone at the store.

A customer had just broken up the fight--which had started in the parking lot--when the suspect made the threat.

Police say the suspect then got into a dark-colored Dodge Charger or Challenger. As the driver pulled out of the parking lot, the suspect began firing at the customer from the passenger side of the car. No one was hurt.

Officers searched the area but were unable to find the suspect vehicle.

The incident happened just after 12:30 a.m. Saturday at the 7-Eleven on 1426 N. Academy. If you were in the area at the time and have any information, call CSPD at 444-7000 or Crime Stoppers at 634-STOP.
