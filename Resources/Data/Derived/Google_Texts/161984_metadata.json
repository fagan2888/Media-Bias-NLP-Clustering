It will be great to have serious money to put into long-term savings starting after paying off bills (two student loans, two cars and a credit card) over the last two years. My husband said I should write to tell you since I have quoted you often through this process. Thank you so much for your sage and straightforward advice. Money and budgets don\u2019t have to be terribly complicated, right?\u201d\n\nNope. Once you put your mind to it, you can get that debt monkey off your back.\n\nI especially love hearing from young adults like this person: \u201cI\u2019m single, in my late 20s, make $50,000, and the only debt I have is my student loans. Before I read your [book] The 21-Day Financial Fast and started following these chats, I was convinced that I needed a second job because I didn\u2019t have any money to save. After doing the fast, I cut, cut, cut my budget and now save a third of my salary and still have what I call my \u2018fun money\u2019 so I can socialize with friends.\u201d\n\nBut there\u2019s more. The person started saving in what I call a \u201clife happens fund,\u201d which is a pot of money separate from your emergency fund. You pull from these savings for something unexpected, such as a major car repair. This way, you aren\u2019t depleting your emergency fund, which you might need if you lose your job.\n\n\u201cMy car had some transmission trouble,\u201d the reader continued. \u201cWhen I took it to the shop, I had to rent a car for two days to get to work. ... No problem! The total bill on my repairs was $989, but again, no problem. This is the first time in my life that car trouble has not crippled me financially. It felt so good to be able to pay for my repairs without having to decide whether I would pay rent late or just eat ramen noodles for three months. I feel liberated. I only had about $1,200 in my emergency fund, but I\u2019ve already saved $500 and am working on getting up to three months\u2019 worth of living expenses. So thank you! And for those just starting out, go slow but keep fighting!\u201d\n\nAnd for those thinking you\u2019ll be stuck with a mortgage for three decades, here\u2019s proof that paying off your principal matters: \u201cYou wrote a column about prepayment, how it actually reduces your overall interest rate. We technically have 24 years left on our 30-year loan at 4.875 percent. It is actually only about five years left because we pay more each month. We didn\u2019t want to pay huge amounts to refinance. Thanks again for that long-ago column. It has had a major influence on us!\u201d\n\nThe person was referring to a 2013 column I wrote on refinance envy. I spelled out how you can cut the amount you\u2019ll pay in mortgage interest and achieve savings similar to what you\u2019d get if you refinanced to a lower interest rate. I suggested that folks go to HSH.com, which publishes mortgage and consumer loan information. The site has a prepayment refinance calculator called \u201cPreFi,\u201d which shows you the effective interest rate you\u2019ll achieve when you prepay your loan. If you would like to prepay your mortgage as though you had a certain interest rate \u2014 say, a 3 percent rate \u2014 the site\u2019s \u201cLowerRate\u201d prepayment calculator allows you to determine the prepayment amount you\u2019ll need to hit that rate either by making regular monthly prepayments or a one-time, lump-sum payment.\n\nI\u2019ll end with this testimony about finding financial freedom: \u201cWe did it! We got off the debt wheel (well almost off)! I\u2019ve been reading you for several years. We decided to sell our house and significantly downsize. I have so much more money left. We took the profits from the first house and paid 50 percent on the new place and put aside six months of housing expenses. We will be 100 percent debt-free in just seven years. So, thank you for making my family rethink the new norm and realize that more stuff isn\u2019t always a good thing!\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "My hope is that their good cheer will encourage you to make a change too.", "og": {"description": "My hope is that their good cheer will encourage you to make a change too.", "title": "Michelle Singletary: Readers discuss joy of finding financial freedom", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20151129-michelle-singletary-readers-discuss-joy-of-finding-financial-freedom.ece", "image": {"width": 345, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/resrsc/images/facebook-default.jpg", "height": 345}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2015-11-30T03:14:26Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2015-11-30T03:09:25Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Michelle Singletary: Readers discuss joy of finding financial freedom\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20151129-michelle-singletary-readers-discuss-joy-of-finding-financial-freedom.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/resrsc/images/facebook-default.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"2558333\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-11-30T03:09:25Z\", \"section\": \"Economy & You Headlines\", \"author\": \"MICHELLE SINGLETARY\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/resrsc/images/facebook-default.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-11-30T03:09:25Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "article_summary": "The site has a prepayment refinance calculator called \u201cPreFi,\u201d which shows you the effective interest rate you\u2019ll achieve when you prepay your loan.\nI spelled out how you can cut the amount you\u2019ll pay in mortgage interest and achieve savings similar to what you\u2019d get if you refinanced to a lower interest rate.\nI\u2019ll end with this testimony about finding financial freedom: \u201cWe did it!\nThe person started saving in what I call a \u201clife happens fund,\u201d which is a pot of money separate from your emergency fund.\nI\u2019ll start with one about debt: \u201cI paid off my student loan earlier this month, leaving us with only our mortgage in the debt column."}
