Liberia sent us Ebola. The least we could do is return the favor by sending them Debbie Wasserman Schultz.

Democrats and the media have been out in force to broadcast the message that Ebola isn't a threat and that we don't need a travel ban on countries where Ebola and Democratic voters come from.

Leading the charge is the chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee to explain why you should definitely want to get Ebola in the United States.

Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Weston, has expressed confidence in the American health care system to handle cases of the ebola virus that occur in the United States. “I’m not at all worried, because if there is any place in the entire world that if you have to get a life-threatening illness like ebola, and you want to make sure that it’s not going to spread, it’s the United States of America,” she said.

Or we could just implement a travel ban and skip the Ebola. Of course that would do nothing to protect us from Debbie Wasserman Schultz, but it would be a start.

Debbie also assured everyone that, "we are focused on making sure that protocols are tightened, that we deploy our very advanced and significant health care system".

ObamaCare to the rescue.

Debbie denied that any travel ban was needed, but urged more protocol tightening, which is apparently code for handing out flyers at airports, and asking them if they have Ebola.

"Going as far as cutting off access to our country and limiting people’s freedom of movement, that's a drastic stop," she said.

It sure is. Like the sort of thing you do in response to a very deadly virus.
