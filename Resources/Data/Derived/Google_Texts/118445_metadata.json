In another school, classes overstuffed with 50 students or more are herded into the auditorium.\n\nThis is not made up, nor is this a third-world country. This is America. This is Philadelphia. And it is rapidly becoming the norm for schools in many more large, urban communities across the nation.\n\nYet this crime is being completely neglected by people leading education policy \u2013 from the Obama administration all the way down.\n\nIn fact, government leadership of the education system in Pennsylvania is so bad, parents have filed a lawsuit to direct attention to the plight of their children.\n\nBut the proper response would be from everyone, not just from one group of parents.\n\nYet, most glaringly absent from making an adequate response are the voices of those who claim they are architects of an education \u201creform movement\u201d and claim to be the ones who care most about the lives of underserved black and brown school children.\n\nCalling themselves servants in the \u201ccivil rights cause of our time,\u201d they avert their oh-so-enlightened gaze from the most glaring civil rights crime being perpetrated in America today.\n\nThe Philadelphia Story\n\nJust how bad are conditions in Philadelphia schools?\n\nReporting from PBS, education correspondent John Tulenko recently went to the city to examine \u201ca school budget crisis that\u2019s been called the worst in the country.\u201d He found a high school where \u201cthe budget for extracurricular activities has dropped to zero, its budget for books zero, and for supplies to $14,000. That\u2019s roughly $5 per student to last the entire year.\u201d\n\nHe found an elementary school of 578 students with no full-time school nurse; so the principal, who has no medical training, has to sub in that role three days a week.\n\nThe ninth grade biology class he visited was \u201cpacked wall to wall with 62 students.\u201d A student he spoke with said, \u201cIt makes me feel annoyed. It slows down the class and what we can learn. And it makes it harder to pay attention when you can\u2019t even get a desk to sit in.\u201d\n\nThe teacher said, \u201cI tried to do a lab with them, and it was extremely difficult because so many of them wanted help and they were not sure of what to do. And you can\u2019t give your attention to 30 pairs of students.\u201d\n\nA recent report from the education writer for The New York Times, Motoko Rich, portrayed an identical scene \u2013 \u201ca sixth-grade math class of 33 students with only 11 textbooks to go around; the teacher rations paper used to print out homework equations.\u201d\n\nThe news from local sources is even grimmer. Last year The Daily News reported the \u201cnew normal\u201d for the district\u2019s 137,000 students and their families.\n\n\u201cClass sizes are skyrocketing \u2013 even though the upper limit under the teachers union contract is 33 kids in each classroom. Already, teachers and parents have complained over social media about class sizes reaching 44 students, even 48 in one case.\u201d\n\nNurses \u2026 counselors \u2026 librarians \u2026 by and large are now things of the past in Philadelphia public schools.\n\nMost kids with chronic health conditions may get attention from school staff who have no training whatsoever in delivering medications or handling emergency health care situations. According to a local news outlet, \u201cTwice in the past year, Philadelphia elementary school students died in local hospitals after taking ill at school \u2013 one from asthma and one from a heart condition. Both incidents happened on days when the school nurse was not present.\u201d\n\nStudents who have been traumatized by a death in the family, homelessness, or bullying have virtually no trained counselors to talk to \u2013 neither do high school students needing help with applications for jobs or higher education.\n\nAlmost all school libraries have been shuttered \u2013 even one that was once hailed as a national model \u2013 despite growth in demand.\n\nA Victim of \u2018Reform\u2019\n\nIn explaining the causes for these declining conditions, reporters have noted the diminishing state funding, the vanishing federal stimulus dollars, and the declining student enrollments.\n\nWhat they don\u2019t tell you is why the money dried up, where it went instead and why the students have fled.\n\nWriting for The Nation, Philadelphia-based journalist Daniel Denvir fills in the backstory. It\u2019s familiar: white flight to the suburbs in the 1950s, a vanishing urban industrial base made up of minority families, and a city left with a rapidly declining middle class.\n\n\u201cRelatively affluent whites funded separate school districts,\u201d Denvir explains, \u201cwhile poorer urbanites were left to fund the impoverished schools left behind.\u201d Instead of unifying the segregated schools into a single metropolitan school system, Philadelphia city schools were left to contend with diminishing resources from a state that has chronically been among the least fair in allocating funds to schools that are the most in need.\n\nWhen local school authorities and the teachers\u2019 union bridled under their yolks, \u201cfurious legislators passed a law authorizing a state takeover.\u201d\n\nFrom that time on, Denvir explains, those who have wanted to wage \u201ceducation reform\u201d against Philly schools have gotten everything they wanted \u2013 branding of public schools as \u201cfailing\u201d based on the No Child Left Behind laws followed by mass school closures and lots of new charter schools, many funded by wealthy philanthropists and private foundations and run by private management companies.\n\n\u201cThe basic structure of school financing in Philadelphia is rigged to benefit these privately managed companies,\u201d Denvir notes. \u201cPublic-school money follows students when they move to charter schools, but the public schools\u2019 costs do not fall by the same amount \u2026 It has been estimated that partly because of these costs, each student who enrolls in a charter school costs the district as much as $7,000. There are outright subsidies too.\u201d\n\nIndeed, as Philadelphia public schools are getting lambasted by budget cuts and staffing layoffs, a local news outlet cheerfully reported that a charter school in the district was getting \u201ca fully-staffed health center.\u201d Further, the school was becoming \u201cone of eight charter schools in the city\u201d with such new facilities.\n\nOfficials for the charter school called it \u201cthe beginning of a holistic strategy to strengthen its neighborhoods.\u201d Good, for sure, but why isn\u2019t this something that public schools in the district have the funds to pay for too?\n\nCharter schools, in fact, are laying claims to new funding for Philadelphia schools coming from a recently state-approved plan to increase local taxes on cigarettes. As independent news outlet The Notebook reported, the new tax bill came with a controversial provision that required the district to start accepting applications for new charter schools.\n\nWhere Do Reformers Stand?\n\nGiven the situation in Philadelphia, you\u2019d expect folks claiming to represent the interests of schoolchildren to sound the alarm and man the ramparts in defense of these students.\n\nFor years, we\u2019ve been hearing that the whole purpose of the so-called education reform movement was to put the interests of students first. So you\u2019d think they\u2019d have something to say when students have their art classes yanked, their school buildings left in horrid states of disrepair, and their classrooms made untenable with overcrowding.\n\nBut while Philadelphia schoolchildren get pushed over the brink, prominent voices in the education reform movement have mostly been content to stay on the sidelines, offer ineffective gestures, or take up the cause of the budget cutters.\n\nThe Obama administration has been conspicuously ineffective in casting a lifeline. U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan last addressed the situation in Philadelphia over a year ago, when news of Philadelphia\u2019s declining state first seeped into the consciousness of Beltway policy leaders.\n\nAs yours truly explained at the time, more than 3,800 district personnel, including hundreds of classroom teachers, had just been fired due to a \u201cDoomsday Budget,\u201d and schoolchildren faced a massive round of cutbacks. The alarming nature of the cuts prompted education historian Diane Ravitch and Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, to write a letter to Duncan beseeching him to \u201cpublicly intervene.\u201d\n\nIn his statement to the Pennsylvania officials overseeing the Philadelphia mess, Duncan urged, \u201cWe must invest in public education, not abandon it.\u201d But he proceeded to do essentially nothing to help ensure that.\n\nEventually, the Obama administration came up with a competitive grant contest ostensibly aimed at inequity but offering no direct help to besieged students. An education journalist at The Washington Post, Valerie Strauss, noted incredulously after the grant competition was announced, \u201cThey still don\u2019t get it. The Obama administration still apparently thinks \u2013 despite evidence to the contrary \u2013 that it can achieve \u2018educational equity\u2019 by holding a contest with winners and losers.\u201d\n\nStrauss recalled, \u201cNo real dent was made in \u2018educational equity\u2019 with a series of Race to the Top contests over the past several years. So now we have a new one \u2026 a $300 million proposed \u2018Race to the Top-Equity and Opportunity.\u2019 After billions of dollars failed to achieve equity, a $300 million contest along the same lines \u2013 but with a targeted title \u2013 is the administration\u2019s answer to the festering problem.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "No nurses, few textbooks, closed libraries: Money to urban schools is being starved, intentionally.
