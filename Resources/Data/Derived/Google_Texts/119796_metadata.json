(AP Photo/Rich Pedroncelli, File)\n\nWith just one-fifth of those surveyed saying they trust government at least most of the time and think government programs are well run, Sam is failing. Two words in the survey\u2019s title are disturbing: \u201cBeyond Distrust.\u201d\n\nFortunately, there is some good news about Sam\u2019s performance.\n\n[Public employees honored with week that says \u2018government works\u2019]\n\nA majority have favorable views of 13 of 17 federal agencies listed, with the U.S. Postal Service at the top. Eighty-four percent view it favorably. The National Park Service, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and NASA all have favorability ratings of 70 percent or more.\n\nAt the other end resides the much-maligned Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), long the focus of a patient wait list scandal. The VA is viewed unfavorably by 52 percent and favorably by 39 percent. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS), which provides terrible service because it is underfunded, is next to last with a 52/42 unfavorable/favorable rating.\n\nBefore the elected officials on Capitol Hill get too critical, they should look within. It\u2019s no surprise that Congress, with its poor record of cooperation and accomplishments, fared worse than any of the agencies, getting an unfavorable/favorable rating of 69/27.\n\n\u201cThis should be a wake-up call to all of the candidates,\u201d Max Stier, president and chief executive of the Partnership for Public Service, a good government group, said of the survey. Rather than running against government, they should say \u201chow they will make government work better,\u201d he added.\n\nIndeed, the survey does not indicate an anti-Washington sentiment, though Republicans clearly want a smaller government.\n\n\u201cMajorities want the federal government to have a major role in addressing issues ranging from terrorism and disaster response to education and the environment,\u201d Pew said. \u201cAnd most Americans like the way the federal government handles many of these same issues, though they are broadly critical of its handling of others \u2013 especially poverty and immigration.\u201d\n\nKeeping the country safe from terrorism draws near unanimous agreement among Republicans and Democrats for the government playing a major role. But a little more than a third of Republicans say that about ensuring access to health care and fighting poverty. Strong majorities of Democrats want the government heavily involved in those areas. Curiously, only about half the respondents from either party favor a big government role in space exploration.\n\nLabor leaders attributed some of the low IRS and VA ratings to stingy financing.\n\nJ. David Cox Sr., president of the American Federation of Government Employees, said the survey might reflect more on Congress than the VA, where his union represents much of the staff. The VA is \u201cstill the no. 1 health care delivery system in the nation\u201d even while understaffed, he said.\n\nAs part of the largest transformation in VA history, a VA statement said \u201cwe are working to restore the trust and faith of the Veterans we are honored to serve, our employees and the American public. We believe we have made progress, but we know we have work to do. As a result, we are laser-focused on improving both the Veteran and customer experience.\u201d\n\nWhile most Americans \u201cdon\u2019t like to pay taxes,\u201d Tony Reardon, president of the National Treasury Employees Union, said the public might not be aware that the IRS provides about 93 percent of the funding for federal programs they do like, including the national parks and safeguarding America\u2019s food, water, medicine, ports and border crossings.\n\nBut Republicans in Congress, upset over allegations of political favoritism by the agency and its role with the Affordable Care Act, have punished the IRS with budget cuts. Given what IRS Commissioner John Koskinen called a \u201ctotally unacceptable\u201d level of service for taxpayers, he told the Federal Diary that he thought the favorability rating could \u201chave even dropped further.\u201d\n\nIRS funding has been cut by $1.2 billion over the last five years. That leaves it at 1998 levels, when adjusted for inflation, according to the agency. It will handle, however, 27 million more returns than it did 17 years ago.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have enough people to deliver on the mission of the agency,\u201d is the message Koskinen said he gets from his employees.\n\nThe White House and the Office of Management and Budget had no comment on Pew\u2019s research, but President Obama did speak to the declining trust in government in a December speech to senior government staffers.\n\n[Obama praises federal senior leaders, announces new programs to support them]\n\n\u201c[W]e do have an issue that we\u2019ve got to address, and that is, Americans don\u2019t trust government like we used to,\u201d he told members of the Senior Executive Service and others. \u201cPart of that is a very deliberate strategy of trying to undermine government. Part of it is political opportunism. But part of it is our need to constantly adapt to the demands of the 21st century\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cIf all we\u2019re doing is hunkering down and trying to push back against complaints and criticisms \u2014 many of which are unfair \u2014 but we\u2019re not engaging in self-reflection and trying to figure out how every single day we can be doing our jobs a little bit better,\u201d he added, \u201cthen we\u2019re failing the American people, and we\u2019re failing an incredible tradition that helped to build this country that you are a part of.\u201d\n\nObama\u2019s take away: \u201cWe\u2019ve got to work harder to make sure that government works.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Pew Research Center survey says just one-fifth of Americans trust government at least most of the time and think government programs are well run.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/joe.davidson.1654", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "A Pew Research Center survey says just one-fifth of Americans trust government at least most of the time and think government programs are well run.", "title": "Survey says Uncle Sam flunks government", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/federal-eye/wp/2015/11/24/survey-says-uncle-sam-flunks-government/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=http://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/files/http://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_908w/2010-2019/Wires/Images/2015-06-20/AP/Veterans_Health_Care-03cb1.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@JoeDavidsonWP"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/federal-eye/wp/2015/11/24/survey-says-uncle-sam-flunks-government/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Pew Research Center; government; Federal Diary; Joe Davidson;", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/joe.davidson.1654"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "Pew Research Center; government; Federal Diary; Joe Davidson;"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd395d\"", "article_summary": "The Internal Revenue Service (IRS), which provides terrible service because it is underfunded, is next to last with a 52/42 unfavorable/favorable rating.\nIf Uncle Sam were in school, he\u2019d flunk government.\nIndeed, the survey does not indicate an anti-Washington sentiment, though Republicans clearly want a smaller government.\n[Public employees honored with week that says \u2018government works\u2019]A majority have favorable views of 13 of 17 federal agencies listed, with the U.S.\nAt the other end resides the much-maligned Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), long the focus of a patient wait list scandal."}
