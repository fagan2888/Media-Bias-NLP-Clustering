Hot Springs, SD

South Dakota's U.S. representative is hosting a House Veterans Affairs Committee hearing on the issues faced by the VA hospital in Hot Springs.



U.S. Rep. Kristi Noem says the hearing in Hot Springs on Thursday will examine the VA's proposed restructuring of its Black Hills Health Care System.



The VA has served veterans in Hot Springs for more than a century but now wants to move some services to Rapid City. The Hot Springs VA hospital is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and would be shuttered. An outpatient clinic would be opened.



South Dakota's congressional delegation opposes the plan.



Attendees at the hearing will include U.S. House VA Committee Chairman Jeff Miller and Larry Zimmerman, the state's secretary of veterans affairs.
