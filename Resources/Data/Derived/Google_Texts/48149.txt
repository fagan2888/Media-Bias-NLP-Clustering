All active-duty, Guard, Reserve, retiree and civilian Airmen will need proof of health care coverage when filing their federal tax returns for 2015.



“This is the first year that Affordable Care Act requires health care validation for filing their taxes and Airmen need this information,” said Robert W. Burke, the Air Force Accounting and Finance Office director, finance division.

Under the ACA, U.S. citizens and legal residents are required to obtain and maintain a minimum standard of health care insurance, called minimum essential coverage. The proof of minimum essential coverage will be provided by the Department of Treasury Internal Revenue Service Form 1095. TRICARE is one of many health providers qualifying for this coverage.



In January 2016, Defense Finance and Accounting Service is required to provide each employee with the IRS Form 1095 for employment during 2015. A hard copy form is scheduled to be mailed to each employee and the form will also be available electronically through myPay under the taxes section.



“The Air Force would like to stress the importance for Airmen to elect to receive the form electronic only,” Burke continued. “This action will save the Air Force $200,000 and cause no environmental impact.”
