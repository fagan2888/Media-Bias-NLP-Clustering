This simple act can be lifesaving.\n\nApproximately two-thirds of home fire deaths occur in homes without working smoke alarms. Since most fatal fires occur at night, it's essential that every home has working smoke alarms to provide an early warning. Working smoke alarms increase the chance of surviving a home fire by 50 percent.\n\nIn addition to changing your smoke alarm and carbon monoxide detector batteries this weekend, the Estes Valley Fire Protection District recommends these additional steps to protect your life, your loved ones, and your home:\n\n\u2022Dust or vacuum smoke alarms when you change the batteries.\n\n\u2022Test alarms once a month using the test button.\n\n\u2022Replace the entire alarm if it's more than 10 years old or doesn't work properly when tested.\n\n\u2022Install smoke alarms on every level of your home, including the basement, and both inside and outside of sleeping areas.\n\n\u2022For the best protection, equip your home with a combination of ionization and photoelectric smoke alarms or dual sensor alarms.\n\n\u2022Interconnect all smoke alarms throughout your home so that when one sounds, they all sound.\n\n\u2022Make sure everyone in your home understands the warning of the smoke alarm and knows how to respond.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2022Review your home escape plan and location of your family's meeting spot.\n\nFor more information contact Fire Marshal Marc Robinson at: mrobinson@estesvalleyfire.org or 970-577-3689.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.eptrail.com/ci_24411368/change-your-clocks-and-change-your-batteries", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site28/2013/1029/20131029__30epsmokealarms~1_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "Special to the Trail-Gazette", "description": "Daylight-saving time ends Sunday, Nov. 3, and marks the 26th anniversary of the Change Your Clock Change Your Battery program, which reminds us to change and test the batteries in our smoke alarms and carbon monoxide detectors.", "ag": {"canon": "EstesParkTrail-Gazette:article:24411368:view"}, "startDate": "2013-11-02T12:24:18-0600", "og": {"url": "http://www.eptrail.com/ci_24411368/change-your-clocks-and-change-your-batteries", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site28/2013/1029/20131029__30epsmokealarms~1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Daylight-saving time ends Sunday, Nov. 3, and marks the 26th anniversary of the Change Your Clock Change Your Battery program, which reminds us to change and test the batteries in our smoke alarms and carbon monoxide detectors.", "title": "Change your clocks and change your batteries"}, "twitter": {"domain": "eptrail.com", "description": "Daylight-saving time ends Sunday, Nov. 3, and marks the 26th anniversary of the Change Your Clock Change Your Battery program, which reminds us to change and test the batteries in our smoke alarms and carbon monoxide detectors.", "title": "Change your clocks and change your batteries", "url": "http://www.eptrail.com/ci_24411368/change-your-clocks-and-change-your-batteries", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site28/2013/1029/20131029__30epsmokealarms~1.jpg", "site": "@eptrailgazette", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-11-02T12:24:18-0600", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "sailthru.title": "Change your clocks and change your batteries", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site28/2013/1029/20131029__30epsmokealarms~1.jpg", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "OLD - Estes Park News", "google-site-verification": "KkJ2C-PvexXpGs0YrC0OaC569g0Ty1BcleONkROSkmQ", "modificationDate": "2013-11-02T12:24:25-0600", "endDate": "2023-10-29T13:32:22-0600", "byline": "Special to the", "sailthru.site": "eptrail.com", "pubDate": "2013-11-02T12:25:28-0600", "news_keywords": "Estes Park news, Colorado news, world news, national news, local news, business news, sports news, entertainment news, us news, EP Trail"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fced10\"", "article_summary": "Daylight-saving time ends Sunday, Nov. 3, and marks the 26th anniversary of the Change Your Clock Change Your Battery program, which reminds us to change and test the batteries in our smoke alarms and carbon monoxide detectors.\nWorking smoke alarms increase the chance of surviving a home fire by 50 percent.\n\u2022Install smoke alarms on every level of your home, including the basement, and both inside and outside of sleeping areas.\nSince most fatal fires occur at night, it's essential that every home has working smoke alarms to provide an early warning.\nApproximately two-thirds of home fire deaths occur in homes without working smoke alarms."}
