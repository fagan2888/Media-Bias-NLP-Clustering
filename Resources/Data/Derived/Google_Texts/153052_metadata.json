Photo via Thinkstock.\n\n\u201cWhat leads to healthier people?\u201d asks John Auer\u00adbach, Dis\u00adtin\u00adguished Pro\u00adfessor of Prac\u00adtice and director of the Insti\u00adtute of Urban Health Research and Prac\u00adtice in the Bouv\u00e9 Col\u00adlege of Health Sci\u00adences. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the care they get from doctor,\u201d he says, \u201cbut their lifestyle choices and the envi\u00adron\u00adment where they live and work.\u201d\n\nThese fac\u00adtors, Auer\u00adbach explains, are used to build population-\u200b\u200bbased health met\u00adrics. And these met\u00adrics, he says, are essen\u00adtial tools that can be used to treat patients, estab\u00adlish pre\u00adven\u00adtive care mea\u00adsures, and save big health\u00adcare dollars.\n\n\u201cWhen you create population-\u200b\u200bbased met\u00adrics, you\u2019re not just looking at how you treat a patient who\u2019s suf\u00adfered a heart attack,\u201d Auer\u00adbach says. \u201cYou\u2019re also mon\u00adi\u00adtoring the myriad envi\u00adron\u00admental aspects that impact the patient\u2019s health.\u201d\n\nAuer\u00adbach is the prin\u00adcipal inves\u00adti\u00adgator on a grant North\u00adeastern recently received from the Robert Wood Johnson Foun\u00adda\u00adtion, the nation\u2019s largest phil\u00adan\u00adthropy devoted solely the public health. The grant\u2014which dove\u00adtails with Northeastern\u2019s com\u00admit\u00adment to pur\u00adsuing use-\u200b\u200binspired research in health, one of the university\u2019s core research themes\u2014will be used to iden\u00adtify a uni\u00adversal set of population-\u200b\u200bbased health met\u00adrics and then inte\u00adgrate them into a toolkit. The toolkit will be used by health\u00adcare orga\u00adni\u00adza\u00adtions to imple\u00adment pay\u00adment reform and other mea\u00adsures aimed at improving patient care and low\u00adering costs.\n\nThe health\u00adcare industry has con\u00adtinued to focus on ways to improve cur\u00adrent pay\u00adment struc\u00adtures as Pres\u00adi\u00addent Obama\u2019s land\u00admark Afford\u00adable Care Act and other ele\u00adments of health\u00adcare reform go into effect. Global pay\u00adments, in which health\u00adcare providers receive large lump sums from payers to cover the expected costs of care, have been put in place to help the health\u00adcare industry tran\u00adsi\u00adtion away from the tra\u00addi\u00adtional pay-\u200b\u200bfor-\u200b\u200bservice model. Sup\u00adporters say global pay\u00adments incen\u00adtivize the health\u00adcare industry to coor\u00addi\u00adnate and deliver effi\u00adcient and effec\u00adtive care, par\u00adtic\u00adu\u00adlarly through pre\u00adven\u00adta\u00adtive care.\n\nThe idea is that access to population-\u200b\u200bbased health met\u00adrics, which link patients\u2019 clin\u00adical expe\u00adri\u00adences with the broader envi\u00adron\u00admental fac\u00adtors in their com\u00admu\u00adni\u00adties, would help insurers make deci\u00adsions that empha\u00adsize pre\u00adven\u00adta\u00adtive care and avoid unnec\u00ades\u00adsary, costly med\u00adical tests.\n\nAuer\u00adbach says the health\u00adcare industry is eager to start working within an accepted frame\u00adwork to mea\u00adsure providers\u2019 ability to improve pop\u00adu\u00adla\u00adtion health. While there are many mean\u00adingful efforts aimed at iden\u00adti\u00adfying evidence-\u200b\u200bbased pop\u00adu\u00adla\u00adtion health indicators\u2014the Insti\u00adtute of Med\u00adi\u00adcine and the Cen\u00adters for Dis\u00adease Con\u00adtrol and Pre\u00adven\u00adtion are but two\u2014no one has yet cre\u00adated a con\u00adsol\u00adi\u00addated and readily acces\u00adsible list of such met\u00adrics. That\u2019s where Auerbach\u2019s group comes in.\n\nLast month, his team began facil\u00adi\u00adtating dis\u00adcus\u00adsions with key orga\u00adni\u00adza\u00adtions and indi\u00advid\u00aduals cur\u00adrently working on pop\u00adu\u00adla\u00adtion health mea\u00adsures in an effort to gather the most up-\u200b\u200bto-\u200b\u200bdate data avail\u00adable. These many stake\u00adholders will be involved throughout the process as Auerbach\u2019s team builds the com\u00adpre\u00adhen\u00adsive user\u2019s guide for pop\u00adu\u00adla\u00adtion health metrics.\n\nTo be suc\u00adcessful, Auer\u00adbach says, the toolkit will need to be acces\u00adsible and under\u00adstand\u00adable. It will also need to be fea\u00adsible for large insur\u00adance com\u00adpa\u00adnies, small community-\u200b\u200bbased doctor\u2019s offices, and orga\u00adni\u00adza\u00adtions in between.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"app_id": 428816560463583}, "generator": "WordPress 4.2.8", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow"}, "article_summary": "These many stake\u00adholders will be involved throughout the process as Auerbach\u2019s team builds the com\u00adpre\u00adhen\u00adsive user\u2019s guide for pop\u00adu\u00adla\u00adtion health metrics.\nAuer\u00adbach says the health\u00adcare industry is eager to start working within an accepted frame\u00adwork to mea\u00adsure providers\u2019 ability to improve pop\u00adu\u00adla\u00adtion health.\nLast month, his team began facil\u00adi\u00adtating dis\u00adcus\u00adsions with key orga\u00adni\u00adza\u00adtions and indi\u00advid\u00aduals cur\u00adrently working on pop\u00adu\u00adla\u00adtion health mea\u00adsures in an effort to gather the most up-\u200b\u200bto-\u200b\u200bdate data avail\u00adable.\nSup\u00adporters say global pay\u00adments incen\u00adtivize the health\u00adcare industry to coor\u00addi\u00adnate and deliver effi\u00adcient and effec\u00adtive care, par\u00adtic\u00adu\u00adlarly through pre\u00adven\u00adta\u00adtive care.\nThe toolkit will be used by health\u00adcare orga\u00adni\u00adza\u00adtions to imple\u00adment pay\u00adment reform and other mea\u00adsures aimed at improving patient care and low\u00adering costs."}
