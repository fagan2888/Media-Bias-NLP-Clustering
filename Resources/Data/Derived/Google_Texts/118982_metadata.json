Women of color and LGBTQ women, for example, fare much worse in terms of pay equality than, say, straight, white, cisgender women. We also know that approximately 20 million American women struggle with eating disorders at some point in their lives.\n\nThose two things might seem oddly paired in the same paragraph. But a new study finds that disordered eating might actually contribute to the disparity within the disparity between men\u2019s and women\u2019s earnings, in ways that can affect the women who have eating disorders for much of their professional lives. According to research published in the International Journal of Eating Disorders, women with illnesses such as anorexia and bulimia are not only at risk of long-term health problems, but also \u201cwere at a distinct disadvantage when trying to achieve socioeconomic independence in early adulthood.\u201d\n\nSo, on top of earning less than men on average, women with eating disorders also earn less than women without. For men who experience disordered eating, however, the economic burdens don\u2019t appear to be the same. Of course, negative effects on earnings are also only one of the detriments the study uncovered for women, the Washington Post reports:\n\n[Women] with such problems \u201chad lower levels of educational attainment, personal income, and lower odds of owning a home in early adulthood compared to females who did not report\u201d the illnesses \u2014 but \u201cthese detrimental associations were not present among males,\u201d the study said. \u201cMy suspicion is that girls who are preoccupied with weight and appearance and insecure at very young age \u2014 that follows you,\u201d said Jennifer Tabler, a PhD candidate in the University of Utah\u2019s Sociology department and the study\u2019s lead author, in a telephone interview with The Washington Post. \u201cYour decision-making process about your life choices are going to be affected by it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "In addition to causing long-term physical & emotional problems, eating disorders can also lead to economic struggle", "title": "The anorexia pay gap: Study shows women with eating disorders earn less", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "In addition to causing long-term physical & emotional problems, eating disorders can also lead to economic struggle", "title": "The anorexia pay gap: Study shows women with eating disorders earn less", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/04/09/the_anorexia_pay_gap_study_shows_women_with_eating_disorders_earn_less/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/shutterstock_84311326.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In addition to causing long-term physical & emotional problems, eating disorders can also lead to economic struggle", "title": "The anorexia pay gap: Study shows women with eating disorders earn less", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/shutterstock_84311326.jpg", "creator": "@@JennyKutner", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Jenny Kutner", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Anorexia, Bulimia, Eating Disorders, Feminism, gender pay gap, gender wage gap, Pay gap, Sexism, study", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd37df\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Anorexia, Bulimia, Eating Disorders, Feminism, gender pay gap, gender wage gap, Pay gap, Sexism, study, Social News, Life News, NewsWe know the gender pay gap doesn\u2019t affect all women equally.\nWe also know that approximately 20 million American women struggle with eating disorders at some point in their lives.\nWomen of color and LGBTQ women, for example, fare much worse in terms of pay equality than, say, straight, white, cisgender women.\nAccording to research published in the International Journal of Eating Disorders, women with illnesses such as anorexia and bulimia are not only at risk of long-term health problems, but also \u201cwere at a distinct disadvantage when trying to achieve socioeconomic independence in early adulthood.\u201dSo, on top of earning less than men on average, women with eating disorders also earn less than women without.\nBut a new study finds that disordered eating might actually contribute to the disparity within the disparity between men\u2019s and women\u2019s earnings, in ways that can affect the women who have eating disorders for much of their professional lives."}
