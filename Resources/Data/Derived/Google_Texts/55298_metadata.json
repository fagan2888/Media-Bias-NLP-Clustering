Here are six things he reveals that are not widely known about one of TV\u2019s most popular doctors:\n\nHe once wanted to change his name to Steve: As a boy growing up in the small community of Novi, Michigan, he encountered prejudice and bullying. Wanting to fit in, he proposed changing his name, inspired by Steve Austin of TV\u2019s The Six Million Dollar Man. His mother talked him out of it. \u201cI told him to be proud of his name, that one day everyone would know it because of the wonderful things he was going to do,\u201d she recalls.\n\nHe\u2019s a Ford Motor Company loyalist: Gupta\u2019s immigrant parents were engineers at Ford Motor Company, and he\u2019s still loyal to the company. He drives a Ford Lincoln Navigator and a Jaguar bought when the British carmaker was owned by Ford.\n\nHe\u2019s much more than a doctor: In addition to his medical responsibilities (apart from his work at CNN and at Grady, he\u2019s an assistant professor of neurosurgery at Emory University, contributes pieces to CBS\u2019s 60 Minutes and does videos and blog posts for Everyday Health.com) Dr. Gupta has published three books, including a novel, Monday Mornings, that briefly became a TV series last winter; competes in triathlons; writes poetry; is a devoted husband to wife Rebecca Olson Gupta; and an involved parent to their three daughters, ages 8, 6, and 4.\n\nHe still works as a neurosurgeon: His viewers may not know that when he\u2019s home in Atlanta, Dr. Gupta operates on patients\u2019 brains and spines at least one day a week at Grady Memorial Hospital, where he is associate chief of neurosurgery. \u201cYou can have immediate healing through operations, and it\u2019s gratifying,\u201d he explains to Parade.\n\nHe loves music while he operates: Dr. Gupta\u2019s OR playlists include hip-hop and the Red Hot Chili Peppers for opening and closing spinal surgeries, when something \u201ca little raucous\u201d is called for, and music that\u2019s \u201cmore chill,\u201d like Coldplay, during operations.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t think the Affordable Care Act is a cure-all: Although Gupta applauds the Act as \u201can important step\u201d he cautions that offering most Americans access to insurance is not enough. \u201cIf you don\u2019t make America healthier, you\u2019re not going to control costs,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd ultimately that\u2019s what we have to do.\u201d\n\nFor more on Dr. Sanjay Gupta, and suggestions on how you can take charge of your health before the end of the year, see Sunday\u2019s Parade.\n\nIn the exclusive video below, Dr. Sanjay Gupta shares a few of his best stay-healthy tips\n\n[onescreen item=\u201d5146690\u2033 playerFill=\u201dwidth\u201d]", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Sanjay Gupta", "author": "Leah Rozen", "og": {"site_name": "Community Table", "description": "This weekend\u2019s issue of Parade features CNN\u2019s Sanjay Gupta on the cover.
