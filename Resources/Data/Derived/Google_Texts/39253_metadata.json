There it has drawn the ire of the Oregon State Parks official who manages viewpoints above, along Mountain View Drive, and warranted a close look by marine deputies with the Jefferson County Sheriff\u2019s Office.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d really like to get it out of there,\u201d Dave Slaght, manager for the Oregon Parks and Recreation Department Cove Palisades Management Unit, said in late July. \u201cBut (state) parks doesn\u2019t manage the water so we are kind of in a conundrum there.\u201d\n\nSitting in the same spot for months and staying exposed for years with little cleaning has left the boat covered in bird and otter droppings, Slaght said.\n\n\u201cIt think it was a nice boat at one time,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it is nice now.\u201d\n\nU.S. Coast Guard records show The Great Escape was built in 1988. Deputies took photos and video of the boat, but did not find any issues that warranted ordering it out of the water, Adkins said .\n\n\u201cThere is nothing illegal about it,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no leaks, there is no environmental hazard.\u201d\n\nThe big boat first appeared on Lake Billy Chinook about two years ago, said Mark Manion, harvest manager for the tribes. It did not seem to fit in with the fishing, house and ski boats on the lake.\n\n\u201cIt looks like something that should be in the ocean or a lot bigger reservoir than Lake Billy Chinook,\u201d Manion said.\n\nTurns out, the ocean is where the boat is heading, the owner, Teryan Runyon of Bend, said late last week.\n\nThe sheriff\u2019s office and other agencies curious about the boat have gotten in touch with Runyon. Adkins said she has told them she has not abandoned it.\n\nRunyon said Friday she\u2019s discussed the situation with the sheriff\u2019s office, and she plans to move The Great Escape this week to the Oregon coast. She would have rented a slip for it at a marina on Lake Billy Chinook but could not find one big enough. After buying the boat 2\u00bd years ago she had it moved from Portland to Bend, where it was restored before going onto Lake Billy Chinook. The boat came with the name and Runyon put it in the lake so it would be close to her, calling it a \u201cnice little cabin on the water.\u201d\n\nNot having a moorage, Runyon said she moves the boat fairly regularly and it is fully functional.\n\n\u201cIt has a stateroom, two baths \u2014 provides a great little space on the water and its view changes every day,\u201d she said.\n\nRunyon said she has not kept the boat in one spot.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been all over the entire lake,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge lake.\u201d\n\nShe did not understand why people would be concerned about The Great Escape being on Lake Billy Chinook.\n\n\u201cI wonder why it would be of any concern to anyone,\u201d Runyon said. \u201cIt\u2019s a public waterway out there.\u201d\n\nThe Oregon State Marine Board has been in a lot of discussions about The Great Escape, including with Jefferson County , Portland General Electric and the tribes, said Randy Henry, boating safety program manager for the Marine Board in Salem. Because of the patchwork of state, federally and tribal-managed land around the reservoir, as well as waters managed by the power company and the tribes, he said the state does not have a rule or reason to move the boat. The power company and tribes jointly own Round Butte Dam, which holds back the waters of Lake Billy Chinook.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing that says you can\u2019t go out there and anchor for a really long time, as long as you are willing to go move your boat and as long as the boat is functional,\u201d Henry said.\n\nThe situation would be different if Lake Billy Chinook was considered a navigable waterway by the state, such as the Willamette River. If the boat were anchored there it would have to be moved at least 5 miles every 30 days. But the lake is not on the state\u2019s navigable waters list , so the rule does not apply.\n\nBy state definition The Great Escape is neither abandoned nor derelict, two labels that could require removal, Henry said. An abandoned boat is one that has been left without authorization on waters of the state or any other waters. Although the tribes\u2019 rules made clear the boat was there without authorization, Henry said the rules for the agencies involved do not. \u201cNo one can claim that it is (where it is now) without authorization,\u201d he said.\n\nDerelict boats include vessels that have sunk or are in imminent danger of sinking, are impeding a waterway or posing risk of becoming an environmental hazard.\n\nWhile agreeing with Slaght, the state park manager, that the boat is an eyesore, Henry said it is not breaking any rules. \u201cIt\u2019s just somebody that has found a place to park the boat,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2014 Reporter: 541-617-7812, ddarling@bendbulletin.com;\n\nReporter Scott Hammers contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A big boat bobbing for the past four months in a cove on Lake Billy Chinook may have been becoming an eyesore, but officials from a host of agencies say the vessel did not violate any rules or laws.
