He was drafted by the Cincinnati Bengals in 1987 and played for NFL Europe in 1991.\n\nWarne, who is the president of the consulting firm, Warrior Society Development LLC, is also working with Native American young people at his tribal youth football camps.\n\nHe spends more than 100 days a year on the road taking his youth football camp to reservations around the country. Football is the vehicle, but his message is so much more. The 49-year-old incorporates the Medicine Wheel philosophy of physical, emotional, spiritual and mental balance in his teachings.\n\nHe\u2019ll be the first to tell you the kids pay more attention to the initials NFL than they do Ph.D, but whatever gets the message across is okay by him.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the reality. I\u2019m a few credits short of my Ph.D,\u201d Warne said during a telephone interview with ICTMN. \u201cIt\u2019s my passion because I am a Seventh Generation philosophy believer and the Seventh Generation is here. Black Elk said it would take seven generations to heal after Wounded Knee. Those kids are here. I\u2019m seeing more kids that are proud to be an Indian or declaring tribal affiliation succeeding.\u201d\n\nBy bringing better equipment and providing coaching from former NFL and college stars to young people on the reservation, he\u2019s giving young players a better opportunity to develop and maybe position themselves for a college scholarship.\n\nBut there is more to being a warrior than having physical or aggressive attributes, Warne said.\n\nHe believes his message of cultural pride, education and spiritual values will carry a young person further in life than being able to excel on the playing field. Warne uses Native coaches and athletes as examples of success in athletics and academics.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been to over 100 reservations in some capacity. Working with a tribe either doing the football camp or grant writing or program and curriculum development,\u201d Warne said. \u201cI do a camp back home at Pine Ridge every year, and I bring (Minnesota Vikings Hall of Famer) Randall McDaniel. When we talk to the schools, I tell him \u2018Look, there are 300 kids in this auditorium and 71 percent of these kids are going to drop out. If the public was better educated, this would not be an issue.\u201d\n\nWarne splits his time as the director of the Center for American Indian Rehabilitation at San Diego State University, motivational speaking engagements, as well as his Warrior Society Development LLC programs.\n\nHis family relocated to Arizona in 1960 to get away from the turbulent, poverty-stricken Pine Ridge reservation in South Dakota.\n\n\u201cWhen my mom moved to Rapid City, Indians weren\u2019t allowed to live in houses yet. There was a tent city down by the creek where Indians were allowed to live,\u201d he explained. \u201cEven though I am a quote-unquote Urban Indian, I am still a big advocate for Indian Country.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s taken the Warrior Society Development camp throughout Indian Country to work with young people from all Native American nations. He\u2019s worked with the Klamath Tribe, Klamath Modoc and Yahooskin in Oregon.\n\nHe\u2019s also put on camps for the Seneca and St. Regis Mohawk Tribes in New York; the Muckleshoot, Kalispel and Colville in Washington state; the Pinoleville, Pala, Soboba, Sycuan, Hoopa, Yurok, Hopland Pomo, Table Mountain, Pechanga and Ft. Mojave tribes in California; and the Seminole Tribes of Florida, as well as others.\n\nThe Medicine Wheel is not conducive to all nations, but the basic structure of physical, mental, emotional and spiritual grounding is the common ground.\n\n\u201cThe Medicine Wheel philosophy is not common, but the circular balance society is something we have in common,\u201d he said. \u201cYou see a lot of tribal logos in a circular form. Our traditional language structure was more circular. We always knew that Mother Earth was round, so when you take the seven directions, it\u2019s a dimensional reality. I always say, \u2018This is what I learned from my people, but you can learn from your own.\u2019\u201d\n\nWarne\u2019s Warrior Society Development camp has been teaching this and much more for a decade now; giving the Seventh Generation the inspiration it needs to move forward and do great things.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jim Warne\u2019s NFL playing career wasn\u2019t as illustrious as St.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "rcjohnson", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/01/08/former-nfl-player-uses-medicine-philosophy-youth-football-camp-153010", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/photo_courtsey_of_jim_warne_-_jim_warne_at_a_warrior_society_football_camp_in_colvillewash.1.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Former NFL Player Uses Medicine Philosophy in Youth Football Camp"}, "dcterms.date": "2014-01-08T08:30-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/01/08/former-nfl-player-uses-medicine-philosophy-youth-football-camp-153010", "dc": {"title": "Former NFL Player Uses Medicine Philosophy in Youth Football Camp"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.title": "Former NFL Player Uses Medicine Philosophy in Youth Football Camp"}, "article_summary": "Working with a tribe either doing the football camp or grant writing or program and curriculum development,\u201d Warne said.\nWarne, who is the president of the consulting firm, Warrior Society Development LLC, is also working with Native American young people at his tribal youth football camps.\nHe spends more than 100 days a year on the road taking his youth football camp to reservations around the country.\n\u201cThe Medicine Wheel philosophy is not common, but the circular balance society is something we have in common,\u201d he said.\nThe 49-year-old incorporates the Medicine Wheel philosophy of physical, emotional, spiritual and mental balance in his teachings."}
