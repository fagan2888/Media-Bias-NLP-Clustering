Heck, just look at all the dumb things he\u2019s said about science in recent years.\u201d\n\n\u201cNet Neutrality\u2019 is Obamacare for the Internet; the Internet should not operate at the speed of government.\u201d \u2013 Ted Cruz on net neutrality.\n\n* Cruz is correct. University of Georgia Economics professor explains: \u201c(Net neutrality) is a bad idea for the same reason that only having vanilla ice cream for sale is a bad idea: some people want, and are willing to pay for, something different. Forcing a one-size-fits-all solution on the Internet stifles innovation by blocking some companies from turning new ideas or business models into successful products.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe last 15 years, there has been no recorded warming. Contrary to all the theories that they are expounding, there should have been warming over the last 15 years. It hasn\u2019t happened.\u201d- Ted Cruz on climate change.\n\n* Ross McKitrick, the Professor of Economics at the University of Guelph in Canada, studied land and ocean temperatures since 1850. He compared this to satellite data from 1979 to 2014. By plotting data trends, he demonstrated that there has been no global warming 19 years. I doubt warming enthusiasts are upset about the disparity of 4 years.\n\nIn 2013 The Economist reported, \u201cOver the past 15 years air temperatures at the Earth\u2019s surface have been flat while greenhouse-gas emissions have continued to soar. The world added roughly 100 billion tonnes of carbon to the atmosphere between 2000 and 2010. That is about a quarter of all the CO2 put there by humanity since 1750.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know, back in the \u201970s \u2014 I remember the \u201970s, we were told there was global cooling. And everyone was told global cooling was a really big problem. And then that faded.\u201d \u2013 Ted Cruz on climate change.\n\n* Simply true. Historically factual. And \u201cdumb\u201d to global warming alarmists.\n\n\u201cYou always have to be worried about something that is considered a so-called scientific theory that fits every scenario. Climate change, as they have defined it, can never be disproved, because whether it gets hotter or whether it gets colder, whatever happens, they\u2019ll say, well, it\u2019s changing, so it proves our theory.\u201d \u2013 Ted Cruz on climate change.\n\n* Over 31,000 scientists with appropriate degrees in earth sciences, including 9,000 PhD\u2019s, have formally declared human activity has no significant effect on climate. Let\u2019s all sing, \u201cHere Comes the Sun!\u201d\n\n\u201cI was disappointed that Bruce Willis was not available to be a fifth witness on the panel. There probably is no doubt that actually Hollywood has done more to focus attention on this issue than perhaps a thousand congressional hearings could do.\u201d \u2013 Ted Cruz on space threats.\n\n* How angry are liberals that they fail to recognize the humor in this remark reflecting the typically ineffectual exercise of congressional hearings?\n\n\u201cI wondered if at some point we were going to see a tall gentleman in a mechanical breathing apparatus come forward and say in a deep voice say, \u201cMike Lee, I am your father\u201d \u2026 and just like in \u201cStar Wars\u201d movies the empire will strike back.\u201d \u2013 Ted Cruz during his 21-hour Obamacare speech.\n\n* Yes, this humorous remark is actually listed as a \u2018dumb\u201d Ted Cruz remark regarding science.\n\n\u201cThe authorizing committees are free to set their agency budgets, and that includes NASA.\u201d \u2013 Ted Cruz when he tried to cut NASA funding in 2013.\n\n* Again, true. President Obama directed NASA\u2019s committee to budget for promoting climate change hype.\n\n\u201cEach day I learn what a scoundrel I am.\u201d \u2013 Ted Cruz on his attempts to defund Obamacare.\n\n* So do most politicians. It\u2019s a scientific fact. #humor\n\n** With acknowledgement to Robert Fisk, originator of \u201cFisking.\u201d\n\n\u2014\u2014-\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2015 Rick Jensen, distributed exclusively by Cagle Cartoons newspaper syndicate.\n\nRick Jensen is Delaware\u2019s award-winning conservative talk show host on 1150AM WDEL and 93.7FM HD3, Streaming live on WDEL.com from 1pm \u2014 4pm EST.
