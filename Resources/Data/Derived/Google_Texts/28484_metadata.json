One by one, rival politicians are carving out positions. On the left Manuel Valls, the Socialist prime minister, sounds ever more like a rival to his own boss. On the right, two former prime ministers are in the running, and a third contender is likely to declare: Nicolas Sarkozy. The former president is expected this weekend to announce his candidacy for the centre-right UMP party leadership, a prelude to a presidential bid.\n\nThe start of the week belonged to Mr Valls, who put his government on the line on September 16th in a parliamentary vote of confidence after his eviction of three anti-austerity rebels last month. He narrowly won, ensuring the government\u2019s survival. But 31 of his own deputies abstained, up from 11 at a previous vote in April, in protest at what they consider to be a betrayal of the socialist policies which Mr Hollande was elected to put in place.\n\nThe ambitious Mr Valls is now treading a difficult line between loyalty to the unpopular Mr Hollande and a muscular desire to show that his more reformist, business-friendly politics can be an alternative to tax-and-spend socialism. It is a perilous strategy. Mr Valls\u2019s poll ratings are tumbling as he becomes linked with Mr Hollande, whose popularity is at a record low of 13%. Damaging revelations by Val\u00e9rie Trierweiler, Mr Hollande\u2019s former partner, as well as the resignation after barely a week in the job of a junior minister who had confessed to not paying tax, are taking their toll on Mr Valls as well. His approval rating fell from 45% in May to 30% in September, with a loss of 13 points among Socialist voters in just one month.\n\nMr Hollande\u2019s dismal standing has also shifted political calculations on the right. One sobering poll has suggested that, were he to face the National Front\u2019s Marine Le Pen in a second-round run-off in 2017, she would win. The polls also suggest that Ms Le Pen would make it into the second round at Mr Hollande\u2019s expense if he stood again\u2014but that she would then lose to the centre-right candidate. This prospect has made the UMP\u2019s nomination a real prize.\n\nHence, in part, the return of Mr Sarkozy. After losing in 2012, he vowed to withdraw from public life. But his promise never rang true. Stung by defeat and galvanised by the failure of a clear successor to emerge on the right, Mr Sarkozy has kept up the suspense. An opening came in May, when Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Cop\u00e9 resigned as party leader because of campaign-financing irregularities. Mr Sarkozy is likely to run in the party leadership race in November, which he will almost certainly win.\n\nHe is not the only aspirant on the right. He faces two minor candidates for the UMP job (Bruno Le Maire and Herv\u00e9 Mariton), although neither stands a chance against him. Two former prime ministers are also eyeing a presidential bid. One, Alain Jupp\u00e9, has confirmed that he will run in the party\u2019s presidential primary. The other, Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, is mulling it over.\n\nIn many ways, it seems improbable that Mr Sarkozy should return. Mr Hollande was elected partly because voters had had enough of an exhausting, look-at-me president. His wife, Carla Bruni, a singer, has told the press she is not keen on a comeback. He is also in a judicial tangle, being put under formal investigation in July in another party-financing case. Yet if anything, this has stiffened his resolve. A return would certainly disrupt the political balance. At a time when the left is riven by internal discord, Mr Valls may relish the chance to take on a reinvigorated opposition on the right.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/50_by_50/the-economist-logo.gif", "sailthru.flytitle": "French politics", "description": "Recent manoeuvres kick off the fight for the presidency in 2017", "pubdate": 20140920, "og": {"site_name": "The Economist", "description": "Recent manoeuvres kick off the fight for the presidency in 2017", "title": "The long road to 2017", "url": "http://www.economist.com/news/europe/21618898-recent-manoeuvres-kick-fight-presidency-2017-long-road-2017", "image": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/the-economist-logo.gif", "type": "article"}, "sailthru.rubric": "Recent manoeuvres kick off the fight for the presidency in 2017", "sailthru.date": "2014-09-20 00:00:00", "twitter": {"image": "https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/the-economist-logo.gif", "site": "@TheEconomist", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.printdate": "2014-09-20 00:00:00", "revisit-after": "1 day", "sailthru.web_section": "Europe", "fb": {"pages": 6013004059, "app_id": 173277756049645}, "articleid": 21618898, "sailthru.image.thumb_mfte": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/ec_related_article_image/the-economist-logo.gif", "sailthru.tags": "French politics", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theeconomist"}, "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/the-economist-logo.gif", "news_keywords": "French politics"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe150c\"", "article_summary": "Stung by defeat and galvanised by the failure of a clear successor to emerge on the right, Mr Sarkozy has kept up the suspense.\nMr Valls\u2019s poll ratings are tumbling as he becomes linked with Mr Hollande, whose popularity is at a record low of 13%.\nMr Sarkozy is likely to run in the party leadership race in November, which he will almost certainly win.\nOn the left Manuel Valls, the Socialist prime minister, sounds ever more like a rival to his own boss.\nMr Hollande was elected partly because voters had had enough of an exhausting, look-at-me president."}
