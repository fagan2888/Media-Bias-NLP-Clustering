Top Three Issues: Repeal of Obamacare, protect life, Second Amendment.\n\nStatement: \"The Washington politicians are not listening to us. I am walking 100 miles across Davidson County and the entire 13th District (from Mooresville to Greensboro). I have heard from you, and I will fight for you in Washington. I will stay true to core conservative beliefs. I will never forget that I serve the people. I am a proven conservative, with a record of service. I am independent of Washington special interests.\"\n\nName: John M. Blust. Age: 61. Residence: Greensboro. Occupation: accountant/attorney. Website: voteforblust.com. Political Experience: chairman, Guilford County Republican Party 1993-1995; N.C. Senate, District 32, 1996-1998; N.C. House, District 62, 2001-present.

I have demonstrated courage under fire, in pressure situations in the military, in professional life and in my political service. All 17 candidates are claiming to be conservatives, but talk is cheap. What good are claims if one cannot hold firm on core beliefs when the pressure is on \u2013 and it will be on in Washington.\"\n\nName: Andrew Brock. Age: 42. Residence: Mocksville.

I'm the only candidate who can say I led the charge for HB2 in the Senate to protect the rights and safety of women and children. Last year, my efforts led to $400 million in income tax cuts for the citizens of N.C. Because of my proven record on tax reform, protecting property rights, cutting regulations and creating jobs, voters know what they will get with me in Congress. I'm the only candidate with the record and experience to hit the ground running for the citizens of District 13.\"\n\nName: Ted Budd. Age: 44. Residence: Advance.

Top Three Issues: Implementing fiscal responsibility, protecting family and freedom from big government, preserving Second Amendment.\n\nStatement: \"Having never run for office before, I did not jump at the opportunity to run for Congress this year. I prayerfully weighed the decision with my family and sought advice from friends. I ultimately made the decision to run, because I don't believe we can expect anything to change as long as we keep sending people with political resumes to Washington. It's time to take on the Establishment. We need people in Congress who are willing to make tough decisions and apply conservative principles. I went to seminary to acquire a biblical lens for life, and I believe that perspective is sorely missing. If you agree with me, I ask for your help on June 7 in sending a true conservative outsider to Congress.\"\n\nName: Kay Daly. Age: 49. Residence: Mooresville.

I proudly espouse traditional, Judeo-Christian, conservative values and will never surrender to political correctness. I support God, guns, family, country, unborn babies, the Confederate flag, our military and our veterans. I oppose deficit spending, silly trade deals that benefit China and all benefits for illegal aliens, including and especially amnesty.

Top Three Issues: not provided.\n\nStatement: \"I'm for a government of the people. The more politicians I meet the more I see they're just out for themselves. This needs to change. I have helped people all my life, and they have helped me. I'm tired of being told how I should follow the rules to be elected. With all the experience of our leaders, I found we don't need leaders. We need elected officials who follow the lead of the people who put themselves there.\"\n\nName: Chad Gant. Age: 41. Residence: Statesville. Occupation: Synergy Legal.

Corruption in our own Republican Party is the single biggest reason that I as a Christian conservative decided to run for Congress. To stand up for what is right. To bring prayer and the Bible back to our schools. To abolish the Department of Education and return our educational control back to the state level where it constitutionally belongs.\"\n\nName: Hank Henning. Age: 41. Residence: High Point.

The current system is fundamentally broken with politicians that are more concerned about staying in office than solving the real problems we are all facing. We need leaders with the resolve to start making genuine change to fix our problems, and I believe that I am the best candidate for the job. Who better to fight for you than a United States Marine!\"\n\nName: Julia C. Howard. Age: 71. Residence: Mocksville. Occupation: Realtor, owner of Howard Realty. Website: votejuliahoward.com. Political Experience: North Carolina State Representative House District 79, previously served four terms on the Mocksville Town Council. Top Three Issues: National security, growing the economy, defending traditional conservative values.\n\nStatement: \"Most of the candidates for Congress talk like a conservative. There's even a few that have voted like a conservative. But I'm the only candidate who has authored real conservative reforms and ensured they've been passed into law. I've never shied away from the big issues and big problems. I'm an author of N.C.'s tax reform, welfare, unemployment insurance reform and ethics reform. I'm proud to be an author of House Bill 2. Our country is facing lots of big problems. We need someone who will do more than talk. We need someone who will tackle these problems head on!\"\n\nName: Matthew J. McCall. Age: 31.

I've been doing that locally my past six years in public office \u2013 reducing my department's annual budget 40 percent while improving service. I'm a big believer in customer service, accountability and transparency. I will work hard for you to reduce non-essential government spending, pay back our national debt, reform the tax code, make Social Security solvent, fix our roads, destroy ISIS, stop illegal immigration (not propose legislation to give illegal aliens driver's licenses like Harry Warren) and defend our right to bear arms.\"\n\nName: Vernon Robinson. Age: 60. Residence: Winston-Salem. Occupation: Businessman. Website: vernonrobinson.org. Political Experience: not provided. Top Three Issues: Veterans, economy, immigration.\n\nStatement: \"I will work to replace the GOP House leadership with constitutional conservatives who will obey the Constitution and Bill of Rights instead of obeying the Establishment to advance their political careers. I will not vote on bills that are unconstitutional or that are brought to a vote without enough time to read them. I won't participate in showcase votes. I will remain accountable to my constituents by Facebooking every vote I cast, hosting weekly, in-district town halls, which will be open to everyone, and building a network of Heritage Action Sentinels that will keep me and other representatives accountable.\"\n\nName: George Rouco. Age: 40. Residence: Mooresville. Occupation: attorney. Website: georgerouco.com. Political Experience: five years as officer in CIA. Top Three Issues: Securing our homeland and borders, ending Obamacare, boosting the economy.\n\nStatement: \"To me, this isn't a campaign; it's a calling.

I'm ready to give back by using my real-world experiences to help protect our homeland and our children against threats to take our freedoms and protections away. I don't want or need a political career. I have pledged to serve no more than three terms in Congress and challenged others to do the same.

Top Three Issues: Jobs and the economy, illegal immigration, the absolute failure of the government to represent the will of we the people.\n\nStatement: \"I believe I am the best person to represent the 13th District because I understand how broken and dysfunctional Washington, D.C., has become. The people need someone to truly fight for the hard-working middle class, for our elderly and our mistreated veterans! We need a representative that is willing to take on the liberals and the traitors that are destroying our conservative Christian European values and heritage. I am pro-Constitution, pro-life , I support building a wall, and oppose policing the world. Our servants have become our masters. This must end.\"\n\nName: James \"Jim\" E. Snyder Jr.. Age: 70. Residence: Lexington. Occupation: attorney at law. Website: jamesesnyderjr.com. Political Experience: Former member of the N.C. House of Representatives, 1972. Top Three Issues: Pro-life, free trade, state-sanctioned torture.\n\nStatement: \"I uncategorically am opposed to abortions regardless of the age of the child in utero and regardless of other causes or reasons. A sore on the soul of our nation is the reluctance of our citizens to be aware of the children who have been destroyed before and following Roe v Wade. In 2002, Ross Perot and I and many others campaigned adamantly against so called 'Free Trade.' I was required to campaign against Senator Elizabeth Dole and her husband as well as the president as to this issue. When I was a boy it was only the bad guys who affected torture as to their enemies. Currently, the same old excuses have been brought forward in an attempt to justify these practices by our nation.\"\n\nName: David W. Thompson. Age: not provided. Residence: Mooresville.

Website: walser4congress.com. Political Experience: Issue-based advocacy at state and federal level. Top Three Issues: Making government functional again, jobs, constituent service.\n\nStatement: \"'Changing the Tone' is the theme of my campaign. The 'game' of politics from the extremes is getting us nowhere. The ideology that best describes me is 'stewardship.' I am fiscally conservative and have my own strongly held beliefs about social issues. However, I believe that the government doesn't belong in people's bedrooms, and the divisive social issues are tearing the country and the Republican Party apart. Let's focus on what we can agree on that truly impacts people's lives and start there to begin dealing honestly with the deficit and debt, health care, national security and the economy.\"\n\nName: Harry Warren. Age: 65. Residence: Salisbury. Occupation: human resource specialist. Website: harrywarrenforcongress.com. Political Experience: three-term state representative, District 77, Rowan County. Top Three Issues: National defense, economic stability, government overreach.\n\nStatement: \"As an experienced legislator with more than 30 years' private sector business experience in three different industries, I am uniquely qualified and able to address problems on the national level, as I have successfully in Raleigh. I have drafted, sponsored, co-sponsored some of the most significant legislation in North Carolina history -- legislation that reduced taxes, protected property rights, reaffirmed and protected our Second Amendment rights, reduced unemployment and protected the integrity of your vote. I was the primary sponsor of the Voter ID bill , Unemployment Compensation Reform Act and the E-verify bill designed to protect jobs for our citizens.\"\n\nMat Batts can be reached at (336) 249-3981, ext. 227, or at mat.batts@the-dispatch.com.

Top Three Issues: not provided.Statement: \"I'm for a government of the people. The more politicians I meet the more I see they're just out for themselves. This needs to change. I have helped people all my life, and they have helped me. I'm tired of being told how I should follow the rules to be elected. With all the experience of our leaders, I found we don't need leaders. We need elected officials who follow the lead of the people who put themselves there.\"Name: Chad Gant. Age: 41. Residence: Statesville. Occupation: Synergy Legal. Website: chadgantforcongress.com. Political Experience: None. Top Three Issues: Cut spending, abolish the Department of Education, overhaul the tax code.Statement: \"I am running for Congress because as a Christian conservative Republican I am upset at the inaction of the Republican House majority towards the liberal left actions by the Obama administration. We need outsiders that are not entrenched in Washington or even Raleigh corruption. Corruption in our own Republican Party is the single biggest reason that I as a Christian conservative decided to run for Congress. To stand up for what is right. To bring prayer and the Bible back to our schools. To abolish the Department of Education and return our educational control back to the state level where it constitutionally belongs.\"Name: Hank Henning. Age: 41. Residence: High Point.

The current system is fundamentally broken with politicians that are more concerned about staying in office than solving the real problems we are all facing. We need leaders with the resolve to start making genuine change to fix our problems, and I believe that I am the best candidate for the job. Who better to fight for you than a United States Marine!\"Name: Julia C. Howard. Age: 71. Residence: Mocksville. Occupation: Realtor, owner of Howard Realty. Website: votejuliahoward.com.

There's even a few that have voted like a conservative. But I'm the only candidate who has authored real conservative reforms and ensured they've been passed into law. I've never shied away from the big issues and big problems. I'm an author of N.C.'s tax reform, welfare, unemployment insurance reform and ethics reform. I'm proud to be an author of House Bill 2. Our country is facing lots of big problems. We need someone who will do more than talk. We need someone who will tackle these problems head on!\"Name: Matthew J. McCall. Age: 31.

I've been doing that locally my past six years in public office \u2013 reducing my department's annual budget 40 percent while improving service. I'm a big believer in customer service, accountability and transparency. I will work hard for you to reduce non-essential government spending, pay back our national debt, reform the tax code, make Social Security solvent, fix our roads, destroy ISIS, stop illegal immigration (not propose legislation to give illegal aliens driver's licenses like Harry Warren) and defend our right to bear arms.\"Name: Vernon Robinson.

Top Three Issues: Veterans, economy, immigration.Statement: \"I will work to replace the GOP House leadership with constitutional conservatives who will obey the Constitution and Bill of Rights instead of obeying the Establishment to advance their political careers. I will not vote on bills that are unconstitutional or that are brought to a vote without enough time to read them. I won't participate in showcase votes. I will remain accountable to my constituents by Facebooking every vote I cast, hosting weekly, in-district town halls, which will be open to everyone, and building a network of Heritage Action Sentinels that will keep me and other representatives accountable.\"Name: George Rouco.

I owe a debt of gratitude to this country for providing refuge and opportunity to my family and me. I'm ready to give back by using my real-world experiences to help protect our homeland and our children against threats to take our freedoms and protections away. I don't want or need a political career. I have pledged to serve no more than three terms in Congress and challenged others to do the same.

The people need someone to truly fight for the hard-working middle class, for our elderly and our mistreated veterans! We need a representative that is willing to take on the liberals and the traitors that are destroying our conservative Christian European values and heritage. I am pro-Constitution, pro-life , I support building a wall, and oppose policing the world. Our servants have become our masters. This must end.\"Name: James \"Jim\" E. Snyder Jr.. Age: 70. Residence: Lexington. Occupation: attorney at law. Website: jamesesnyderjr.com. Political Experience: Former member of the N.C. House of Representatives, 1972. Top Three Issues: Pro-life, free trade, state-sanctioned torture.Statement: \"I uncategorically am opposed to abortions regardless of the age of the child in utero and regardless of other causes or reasons. A sore on the soul of our nation is the reluctance of our citizens to be aware of the children who have been destroyed before and following Roe v Wade. In 2002, Ross Perot and I and many others campaigned adamantly against so called 'Free Trade.' I was required to campaign against Senator Elizabeth Dole and her husband as well as the president as to this issue. When I was a boy it was only the bad guys who affected torture as to their enemies. Currently, the same old excuses have been brought forward in an attempt to justify these practices by our nation.\"Name: David W. Thompson. Age: not provided. Residence: Mooresville.

Top Three Issues: Making government functional again, jobs, constituent service.Statement: \"'Changing the Tone' is the theme of my campaign. The 'game' of politics from the extremes is getting us nowhere. The ideology that best describes me is 'stewardship.' I am fiscally conservative and have my own strongly held beliefs about social issues. However, I believe that the government doesn't belong in people's bedrooms, and the divisive social issues are tearing the country and the Republican Party apart. Let's focus on what we can agree on that truly impacts people's lives and start there to begin dealing honestly with the deficit and debt, health care, national security and the economy.\"Name: Harry Warren.

Top Three Issues: National defense, economic stability, government overreach.Statement: \"As an experienced legislator with more than 30 years' private sector business experience in three different industries, I am uniquely qualified and able to address problems on the national level, as I have successfully in Raleigh. I have drafted, sponsored, co-sponsored some of the most significant legislation in North Carolina history -- legislation that reduced taxes, protected property rights, reaffirmed and protected our Second Amendment rights, reduced unemployment and protected the integrity of your vote.
