REUTERS/Transgender Legal Defense & Education Fund/Handout via Reuters\n\nAfter filing a federal lawsuit against the South Carolina Department of Motor Vehicles last September, one transgender teen has won the right to appear as she wishes in her driver\u2019s license photo \u2014 a settlement that\u2019s sure to affect transgender people across the country.\n\nChase Culpepper, who was born a male, was denied a driver\u2019s license photo in March 2014 because she wears makeup and dresses in androgynous or women\u2019s clothing. DMV employees refused the picture based on a DMV policy that bans license photos when a person purposefully alters his or her appearance.\n\nBut with the settlement, which goes into effect in next month, that policy will change; employees will be trained to properly interact with \u201ctransgender and gender non-conforming individuals,\u201d and make clear that a person is not misrepresenting his or her identity \u201cwhen the applicant\u2019s makeup, clothing, or accessories do not match traditional expectations,\u201d the Los Angeles Times reported. The state DMV\u2019s Executive Director Kevin Shwedo also apologized to Chase and her mother.\n\n\u201cI am thrilled with the outcome of my lawsuit,\u201d Chase, who is now 17 years old, said in a statement. \u201cMy clothing and makeup reflect who I am. From Day One, all I wanted was to get a driver\u2019s license that looks like me. Now I will be able to do that. It was hurtful to be singled out for being transgender and made to feel that somehow I wasn\u2019t good enough.\u201d\n\nChase was represented by the New York-based Transgender Legal Defense and Education Fund. Its Executive Director Michael Silverman said he hoped the settlement would influence change in other state agencies with similar policies. \u201cDepartments of motor vehicles and other government agencies cannot restrict the freedom of transgender people to look like their true selves,\u201d he told the Times.\n\nTransgender discrimination still persists in many ways throughout the United States, especially among people of color. According to a report from the National Center for Transgender Equality and the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, 78 percent of survey respondents reported harassment and 35 percent reported physical assault while in grades K-12.\n\nPeople who identify as transgender also face inequality in the workplace, with double the rate of unemployment. Meanwhile, 90 percent of those who are able to find work experience various forms of mistreatment and discrimination. They also face high rates of discrimination trying to find housing, and are often denied equal treatment in public areas like retail stores, hotels and restaurants, hospitals and clinics, and, as Chase experienced, government agencies.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "transgender, teen, gets, south, carolina, change, drivers, license, photo, policy, denying", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A transgender teen in South Carolina will be allowed to wear makeup in her driver's license photo after settling a lawsuit with the state DMV.", "title": "SC Transgender Teen Wins Right To Wear Makeup In License Photo", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/transgender-teen-gets-south-carolina-change-drivers-license-photo-policy-denying-330360", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/22/chase-culpepper.JPG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A transgender teen in South Carolina will be allowed to wear makeup in her driver's license photo after settling a lawsuit with the state DMV.", "title": "SC Transgender Teen Wins Right To Wear Makeup In License Photo", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/transgender-teen-gets-south-carolina-change-drivers-license-photo-policy-denying-330360", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/22/chase-culpepper.JPG", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/22/chase-culpepper.JPG"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-04-22T15:42:55-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-22T15:42:54-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A transgender teen in South Carolina will be allowed to wear makeup in her driver's license photo after settling a lawsuit with the state DMV."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3d83\"", "article_summary": "From Day One, all I wanted was to get a driver\u2019s license that looks like me.\nChase Culpepper, who was born a male, was denied a driver\u2019s license photo in March 2014 because she wears makeup and dresses in androgynous or women\u2019s clothing.\nSouth Carolina's motor vehicles agency will change its driver's license photo policy as part of a settlement reached with Culpepper, a transgender teenager who was required to remove her makeup for her picture last year, lawyers said on Wednesday.\n\u201cDepartments of motor vehicles and other government agencies cannot restrict the freedom of transgender people to look like their true selves,\u201d he told the Times.\nChase Culpepper, 17, is seen in an undated handout picture courtesy of the Transgender Legal Defense & Education Fund (TLDEF)."}
