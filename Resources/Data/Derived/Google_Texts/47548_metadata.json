Ted Cruz\u2019s tea party credentials are unassailable. But as he mulls a presidential run, he\u2019s reaching out to other key parts of the Republican base, including Christian conservatives who dominate the Iowa GOP caucuses every four years.\n\nWith enduring friction between grass-roots activists and the \u201cestablishment\u201d that Cruz so often denounces, a candidate who can appeal across several factions would have an edge. That was a subtext for his latest visit, with a side trip last week to a corner of Iowa where no Texas politician pops up by accident.\n\nAfter an introduction that mentioned Obamacare protests at the U.S. Capitol, Cruz drew an allusion to a biblical battle.\n\n\u201cI was just waiting for you to say they circled it seven times and then they blew their trumpets,\u201d he quipped. \u201cI look forward to being there next time when the walls of Jericho come to the ground.\u201d\n\nThis was Cruz\u2019s fourth Iowa visit in eight months. He\u2019s scheduled to be in New Hampshire twice in April. The only mystery isn\u2019t whether he\u2019s testing the waters for a presidential run, but how far he can go.\n\n\u201cI love the guy,\u201d said Brenda Muth, a farmer with 3,600 hogs on 1,700 acres. \u201cHe\u2019s just strong in his faith and beliefs. He doesn\u2019t waver at all. \u2026 I am like, happy, happy, happy. He, to me, is the one.\u201d\n\nMuth was one of 200 or so Republicans gathered Tuesday night from all corners of Cerro Gordo County, and all wings of the party \u2014 tea partiers and libertarians, evangelicals and business owners. Cruz offered something for all of them.\n\nOne minute he played the populist, railing against the political establishment and big business. The problem, he said, is \u201centrenched politicians in both parties. \u2026 They get there, and they stop listening to us.\u201d\n\nMoments later he was the tea party rabble-rouser.\n\n\u201cWe are going to repeal every word of Obamacare,\u201d he said, and the pressure won\u2019t come from anyone who\u2019s run for office. \u201cIt has to come from the American people.\u201d\n\nAnd then he was wrapping himself in the Reagan mantle, drawing parallels between his own alienation from the establishment and the Gipper\u2019s.\n\n\u201cLet me remind you in 1980, Washington, D.C., despised Ronald Reagan,\u201d said Cruz. \u201cAnd what happened was the American people rose up and brought the Republican Party back to our core principles. And once they swept into office, then suddenly everybody became a Reagan Republican.\u201d\n\nAbout 200 people paid as little as $25 for coffee, cupcakes and some time with Cruz at Music Man Square, a mock-up of River City, the setting of The Music Man by hometown composer Meredith Willson.\n\nAmong those on hand was Dave Dirksen, 50, who farms a modest plot and works in customer service for Winnebago, the RV maker. He supported Rick Santorum in the presidential caucuses of 2012 and Mike Huckabee four years before that \u2014 marking him as a religious conservative.\n\n\u201cIn Iowa, [Cruz] would do fairly well,\u201d Dirksen said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how well he\u2019d do in some of the other states. He\u2019s not the establishment pick, shall we say.\u201d\n\nGabriel Haugland, the county GOP chairman, led Gov. Rick Perry\u2019s effort in 20 surrounding counties last time around. Like Cruz, he said it\u2019s vital for the next nominee to reconvene the old winning GOP coalition \u2014 social and fiscal conservatives, and national security hawks.\n\nMitt Romney couldn\u2019t pull that off.\n\n\u201cWe do have a little bit of a schism,\u201d Haugland said.\n\nEarlier in the day, Cruz spoke to a conference of Christian home-schoolers in Des Moines. There, the religiosity was even more overt.\n\nIn a hotel ballroom filled with about 800 parents and children, he boasted of his role as a legal advocate defending a Ten Commandments display at the Texas Capitol, and ensuring that \u201cone nation, under God\u201d remained in the Pledge of Allegiance. Cruz is a Southern Baptist whose father, Rafael Cruz, is a pastor.\n\nHe then launched a lengthy indictment of the Obama administration, over IRS hassles for religious and tea party groups to the Obamacare mandate for employers to provide contraceptive coverage.\n\n\u201cRight now, the Obama administration is litigating against the Little Sisters of the Poor,\u201d he said, referring to an order of Catholic nuns that joined the push-back against the law. \u201cWe have never seen an administration with such hostility to religious faith.\u201d\n\nMost dramatically, he invoked last weekend\u2019s Jewish celebration of Purim, a festival that commemorates a failed plot to kill the Jews of Persia. The king halts the plot when his queen, an assimilated Jew, intercedes.\n\n\u201cWhen she opened her mouth, she put herself at considerable risk,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cThe story of Purim is a story of action, of ... acting on your faith.\u201d\n\nIn his retelling, it sounded like an allegory not just for religious freedom but for the slings and arrows he\u2019s taken in Washington the last 15 months.\n\nFaith, he said, \u201cis stepping forward with everything you have and saying, just like Esther, \u2018I am here for a time such as this.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe ovation was powerful. Such popularity among evangelicals has a very practical side in Iowa \u2014 a devoted following can make a huge difference on caucus day, when organization and persuading your neighbors helps win votes.\n\n\u201cThese are your grass roots,\u201d said Tamara Scott, Iowa director of Concerned Women for America and a member of the Republican National Committee. \u201cThese are your house sign locations, your parade walkers. This is your fervor, and fervor can do a lot that money can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nCruz\u2019s potential for checking so many boxes would set him apart from most of the field.\n\n\u201cImagine what would happen in the Republican Party if you brought together the evangelicals, the tea partiers, the fiscal conservatives,\u201d Scott said. \u201cIt would be exciting. Exciting to watch.\u201d\n\nOne huge obstacle for Cruz, though, could be resistance from the business community, which remains a force even in the Iowa caucuses. His willingness to force a government shutdown last fall, and brinkmanship over the debt ceiling, alarmed traditional chamber-of-commerce Republicans.\n\nCruz hasn\u2019t hired staff yet, unlike Sen. Rand Paul, another potential contender who recently put the outgoing state GOP chairman on his payroll.\n\nCruz met privately, though, throughout a long day Tuesday with potential backers. And he eagerly posed for photos and worked the crowd after each stop, creating the sort of memories that can pay dividends in 22 months.\n\nIowans who backed Perry in 2012 \u2014 or Santorum, Michele Bachmann or Herman Cain \u2014 are giving Cruz admiring glances. Those who supported Ron Paul are predisposed to support his son, but many see Cruz as a strong alternative.\n\nThe Mitt Romney middle remains elusive. But unless New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie or former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush jumps in, those voters have no natural home at the moment.\n\nCruz is \u201cdoing the things in Iowa that are necessary to run, if he wants to do that,\u201d said David Fischer, co-chairman of Ron Paul\u2019s campaign in 2012 and, until recently, co-chairman of the Iowa GOP. \u201cPeople are enthused. People are curious.\u201d\n\nOne of Iowa\u2019s most influential religious conservatives, Bob Vander Plaats of the group the Family Leader, views Cruz as the current front-runner.\n\n\u201cIf the caucuses were held today he would probably lap the field,\u201d unless Huckabee runs again, said Vander Plaats, whose group hosted Cruz last summer at an evangelical summit in Ames. \u201cHe does check a lot of boxes.\u201d\n\nIowa Republican U.S. Rep. Steve King \u2014 who took Cruz pheasant hunting after that summit and has been serving as his political Sherpa in the state \u2014 called the senator a \u201cfull-spectrum conservative.\u201d\n\nFor a constitutionalist or a voter who prizes religious freedom or any other flavor of conservative, King said, \u201ceach note has been on key. \u2026 He seems to resonate.\u201d\n\nOn Twitter:\n\n@toddgillman", "article_metadata": {"description": "Representing several GOP factions could be an edge in the budding 2016 presidential race.", "og": {"description": "Representing several GOP factions could be an edge in the budding 2016 presidential race.", "title": "Cruz appeals to several factions within GOP", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/headlines/20140322-cruz-appeals-to-several-factions-within-gop.ece", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/headlines/20140322-cruz_iowa.1.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/Cruz_Iowa.1.jpg", "height": 379}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2014-03-23T05:22:23Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2014-03-23T04:02:33Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Cruz appeals to several factions within GOP\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/headlines/20140322-cruz-appeals-to-several-factions-within-gop.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/headlines/20140322-cruz_iowa.1.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/Cruz_Iowa.1.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"1539721\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-03-23T04:02:33Z\", \"section\": \"Politics Headlines\", \"author\": \"TODD J.
