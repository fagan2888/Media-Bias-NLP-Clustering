For 17-year-old Karrie Brown of Collinsville, Ill., her dream became a reality when Wet Seal, her favorite clothing brand, offered her the chance of a lifetime. The teen with Down syndrome was going to have her very own Wet Seal photo shoot modeling the clothes that she loves.\n\nKarrie's modeling gig all started on Aug. 12 when her mother, Sue, posted a picture of her daughter wearing the clothes on Facebook, the Huffington Post reports. Sue\u2019s friends commented on the picture noticing how the clothes complemented Karrie\u2019s look. The Facebook commentators all asked where her daughter\u2019s outfit came from, and Sue simply told them Wet Seal.\n\nSue was convinced by her friends to turn Karrie\u2019s dreams into a reality by starting a Facebook page called \"Karrie Brown - Modeling the Future\" to get Wet Seal\u2019s attention.\n\n\"She immediately caught our attention,\" Wet Seal's Yasmin Ezaby told ABC News. \"We then asked our fans to get Karrie's Facebook page to 10k likes and we would give her the trip of a lifetime. She exceeded this goal in two days.\"\n\nKarrie\u2019s page immediately exceeded 10,000 Likes and currently stands at 20,000 Likes.\n\nThe Wet Seal corporate office told the Browns that they would go on an all-expenses-paid trip to the company\u2019s headquarters in Los Angeles for a professional photo shoot and a trip to Disneyland.\n\nFor the photo shoot, Karrie had a simple request as Wet Seal\u2019s new model \u2014 to have the music of iconic pop star Justin Bieber playing in the background. \"She asked for Justin Bieber so she could sing and dance while shooting,\" Ezaby told ABC News. \"It was loads of fun. She was a natural in front of the camera.\"\n\n\"She comes to life when the camera is on her,\u201d Sue told KMOV, a local station in St. Louis, Mo. \u201cI was told by this geneticist to never expect anything from her.\" But Sue disregarded the geneticist's advice, and now her daughter serves as an inspiration for young adults with disabilities. Sue has even begun a non-profit foundation called \u201cKarried Away\u201d to help young adults with disabilities find meaningful employment.\n\n\"I just want people to understand my daughter is very capable of doing other things,\" Sue said on The Today Show, noting that young adults with Down syndrome have a difficult time finding employment outside the service sector.\n\nKarrie\u2019s thirst for success does not stop at a Wet Seal photo shoot. The teen also hopes to dance with Ellen DeGeneres. Karrie has uploaded a video on Facebook showing her best dance moves to Ellen.\n\nKarrie\u2019s photo shoot will be released on Wet Seal\u2019s website and other media channels in the upcoming weeks.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "karrie brown, down syndrome, wet seal, model", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Karrie Brown, a 17-year-old girl with Down syndrome, scores a new modeling gig with Wet Seal.", "title": "Karrie Brown, Teen With Down Syndrome, Is The New Wet Seal Model", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/karrie-brown-teen-down-syndrome-new-model-clothing-brand-wet-seal-257642", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/23/karrie-brown-wet-seal-outfit.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Karrie Brown, a 17-year-old girl with Down syndrome, scores a new modeling gig with Wet Seal.", "title": "Karrie Brown, Teen With Down Syndrome, Is The New Wet Seal Model", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/karrie-brown-teen-down-syndrome-new-model-clothing-brand-wet-seal-257642", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/23/karrie-brown-wet-seal-outfit.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/23/karrie-brown-wet-seal-outfit.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Consumer News", "published_time": "2013-09-23T13:36:50-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-23T13:39:19-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Karrie Brown, a 17-year-old girl with Down syndrome, scores a new modeling gig with Wet Seal."}, "article_summary": "The teen with Down syndrome was going to have her very own Wet Seal photo shoot modeling the clothes that she loves.\nFor 17-year-old Karrie Brown of Collinsville, Ill., her dream became a reality when Wet Seal, her favorite clothing brand, offered her the chance of a lifetime.\nThe Facebook commentators all asked where her daughter\u2019s outfit came from, and Sue simply told them Wet Seal.\n\"She comes to life when the camera is on her,\u201d Sue told KMOV, a local station in St. Louis, Mo.\nFor the photo shoot, Karrie had a simple request as Wet Seal\u2019s new model \u2014 to have the music of iconic pop star Justin Bieber playing in the background."}
