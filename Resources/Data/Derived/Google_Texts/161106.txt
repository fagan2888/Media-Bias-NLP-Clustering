About $340,000 in bookkeeping errors related to an Orleans Parish Civil District Court fund doesn't represent missing money, Clerk Dale Atkins stressed in a statement this afternoon.

The sum is a "variance" caused by data entry errors, she said. The mistakes amount to less than 1 percent of the roughly $53 million handled by her office's Registry of Court Fund, a holding account where litigants park money as they await the court's judgment.

An audit report released Monday (July 21) by the state Legislative Auditor's office was critical of the Clerk's accounting practices, which led to transactions not being correctly recorded -- $338,464 worth as of Dec. 31, 2013.

The report does not suggest the money was stolen or embezzled, only incorrectly accounted for.

The audit describes the accounting procedure that resulted in the errors as a "significant deficiency" but not a "material weakness," a more serious failure in accounting jargon.

"We take very seriously the auditor's report," Atkins said in a written statement that. The office is in the process of reconciling the fund's transactions one at a time to correct the accounting errors, she said.

"This is an extensive process and will take time given the high number of transactions we receive each year," she said.

This is the second year in a row that an audit found the Clerk's accounting controls to be lacking. In 2012, the same fund's books were off by nearly $80,000.

When the 2013 audit turned up the discrepancy, Atkins said that her office had begun "the process of developing a database" that would address the accounting mistakes and prevent them in the future.

She said the same thing after the 2012 audit.
