A member of the Tarrant County Sheriff’s Office Posse was killed in a motorcycle accident Saturday.

Dennis Hanson, 67, was headed to deliver school supplies and shoes with his church, according to the Posse’s website. Hanson died at the scene after his motorcycle hit a curb in the 2200 block of Golden Triangle Boulevard west of Keller about 8 a.m., said police spokeswoman Cpl. Tracey Knight.

Sheriff Dee Anderson described Hanson as “a special man who played a special role in the Posse,” a volunteer organization that aids the sheriff’s office and represents it in parades and other events.

“He was a guiding force for those around him,” Anderson said in a statement on the Sheriff’s Office Facebook. “There has been no better representative of the Posse in recent years than Dennis. Always enthusiastic and with a constant smile on his face, he proudly rode his horse with the group as an example of good will and Texas heritage unique to Texas Sheriffs’ offices.”

Hanson was awarded the TCSO Posse Top Hand Award in 2011.

Anderson offered his prayers and thoughts to Hanson and his family.

“It is a dark day, but we will live on as Dennis would have wanted, and the Posse will ride proud in his honor and memory,” he said.
