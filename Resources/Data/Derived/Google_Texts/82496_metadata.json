Morgan; Ben Story, head of U.K. investment banking and broking at Citi; and James Agnew, chairman of U.K. corporate broking at Deutsche Bank, will appear at the same 9.30am meeting.\n\nThese banks all pitched higher valuations for Royal Mail than was ultimately achieved at its IPO, according to Adrian Bailey, chairman of the Business Select Committee.\n\nGert Zonneveld, co-head of research, Panmure Gordon, which published a research note in the week prior to Royal Mail\u2019s flotation suggesting a higher valuation than was ultimately achieved, will also appear at the 9.30am meeting.\n\nFinancial News first reported last month that representatives from these institutions would be called by MPs to answer questions on the Royal Mail IPO.\n\nThe Business Select Committee session will provide a rare insight into the pitching tactics used by investment banks looking for work on IPOs. The usually-private process will be questioned by MPs on the committee, with bankers from each institution involved appearing at the same time in public.\n\nThe committee will also hear from business secretary Vince Cable and business minister Michael Fallon at a hearing on Wednesday November 27 at 10.30am.\n\nA representative of the Shareholder Executive, which manages the U.K. government\u2019s publicly-owned businesses and previously housed the Royal Mail, and a representative of Lazard, the government\u2019s financial adviser on the postal operator\u2019s privatization, will also appear at this hearing. Representatives from each organization are yet to be confirmed, the committee said. A person familiar with the situation said Lazard would be sending William Rucker, chief executive of Lazard in London.\n\nJP Morgan, Deutsche Bank, Citi and Panmure Gordon declined to comment. Goldman Sachs and UBS could not be reached for comment in time for publication.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Senior bankers who will face members of the U.K. Parliament over the privatization of Royal Mail were named on Thursday ahead of a hearing due next week.", "title": "Here Are the Bankers Who\u2019ll Face MPs over Royal Mail IPO", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2013/11/14/here-are-the-bankers-wholl-face-mps-over-royal-mail-ipo/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-AK184_1114po_G_20131114115324.jpg"}, "site": "WSJMoneyBeat", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Markets", "article.headline": "Here Are the Bankers Who\u2019ll Face MPs over Royal Mail IPO", "description": "Senior bankers who will face members of the U.K. Parliament over the privatization of Royal Mail were named on Thursday ahead of a hearing due next week.", "article_section": "Markets", "author": "Richard Partington", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "MoneyBeat Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "MoneyBeat", "article.summary": "Senior bankers who will face members of the U.K. Parliament over the privatization of Royal Mail were named on Thursday ahead of a hearing due next week.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2013-11-14T17:05:36-05:00", "dj.asn": "10-160", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2013/11/14/here-are-the-bankers-wholl-face-mps-over-royal-mail-ipo/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-MBB-11769", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Markets", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Senior bankers who will face members of the U.K. Parliament over the privatization of Royal Mail were named on Thursday ahead of a hearing due next week.", "title": "Here Are the Bankers Who\u2019ll Face MPs over Royal Mail IPO", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2013/11/14/here-are-the-bankers-wholl-face-mps-over-royal-mail-ipo/", "image": {"width": 553, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-AK184_1114po_G_20131114115324.jpg", "height": 369}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "MoneyBeat", "article.id": "BL-MBB-11769", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2013-11-14T17:07:27-05:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd809b\"", "article_summary": "The Business Select Committee also named four representatives from investment banks that suggested higher valuations for Royal Mail could be achieved.\nFinancial News first reported last month that representatives from these institutions would be called by MPs to answer questions on the Royal Mail IPO.\nThese banks all pitched higher valuations for Royal Mail than was ultimately achieved at its IPO, according to Adrian Bailey, chairman of the Business Select Committee.\nEuropean Pressphoto AgencySenior bankers who will face members of the U.K. Parliament over the privatization of Royal Mail were named on Thursday ahead of a hearing due next week.\nThe Business Select Committee session will provide a rare insight into the pitching tactics used by investment banks looking for work on IPOs."}
