Buy this photo\n\nOregon Health & Science University has taken over staffing at Columbia Memorial Hospital\u2019s emergency care.\n\nThe hospital\u2019s contract with North Coast Emergency Physicians, which had provided staffing for more than 20 years, ended Sept. 30, and OHSU\u2019s doctors took over the next day.\n\nThe hospital\u2019s leaders stressed the change in ER operators wasn\u2019t about quality, but rather about OHSU\u2019s ability to recruit physicians.\n\n\u201cThe real decision around that was the leader of the physicians group saying he was stepping back,\u201d Trece Gurrad, the vice president of clinical services.\n\n\u201cWe kept it going as long as we could,\u201d the former director of the doctor\u2019s group, Dr. Larry Zagata, said, adding it was increasingly difficult to find doctors to come to Astoria. \u201cI hope we took care of the community well. I think we did.\u201d\n\nZagata, who is still working at the hospital, said he and hospital CEO Erik Thorsen started looking into the change a couple of years ago, first reaching out to Legacy Emmanuel and later to OHSU.\n\nCoordinating the staffing for university is Anthony Ferroggiaro, assistant professor in OHSU\u2019s department of emergency medicine and medical director of Columbia Memorial\u2019s emergency department.\n\n\u201cThe volume that we see right now that we need at times two providers to see patients and initiate patients,\u201d Ferroggiaro said. \u201cThere are often three to four nurses in the ER throughout the day.\u201d\n\nOHSU has hired three physicians, so far. The goal, Thorsen said, is to have six full-time doctors dedicated to Astoria, along with part-timers to cover time off.\n\nEmergency room\n\nThe hospital\u2019s ER is a Level IV trauma center, providing advanced trauma life support and staffing at least one doctor and nurse practitioner throughout the day. Thorsen estimated the ER takes in between 1,000 and 1,200 patients a month. Zagata estimated at least half of those patients are eventually transferred to higher-level trauma centers, mostly in Portland.\n\nZagata said the single biggest source of trauma patients is from motor vehicle accidents, adding the ER sees patients off cruise ships and a lot of logging accidents. Columbia Memorial also takes trauma patients from the coverage area of Providence Seaside, which is not equipped as a trauma center.\n\nThorsen said the patient loads at the ER and in the hospital\u2019s urgent care center have been increasing. He credited the Affordable Care Act, more Medicaid coverage and a local shortage of primary care providers seeing Medicaid and Medicare patients, whose government insurance provides a lower reimbursements.\n\n\u201cWe prefer to work 11 shifts of 12 hours per month,\u201d Ferroggiaro said. \u201cThere are doctors who work more or less, it also depends on the level of illness of the patients in the department.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easier of they have bruises or colds,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have oncology (cancer) patients and cardiology patients who can become quite ill. It can take special focus and is oftentimes more taxing on the patient.\u201d\n\nThe hospital\u2019s cardiology clinic, a partnership with OHSU, started seeing patients in late 2010, and the CMH Cancer Clinic, another partnership, started in late 2011.\n\nProving ground\n\nThorsen said Columbia Memorial Hospital is the first rural emergency medicine department staffing OHSU has taken over, another in the line of groundbreaking partnerships between the two hospitals that stretch back to telemedicine in 2010.\n\nNext year, the hospital will expand its ER and start hosting second-year emergency medical residents, state-licensed doctors working under supervision as they build a specific focus on ERs.\n\n\u201cHopefully they\u2019ll be open to working with us, if they haven\u2019t practiced or lived here before,\u201d Gurrad said.\n\nThorsen said these partnerships are calculated risks because of the investment in infrastructure, employees and the time it takes to build up patient bases for specialty treatments.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful partnership for CMH, and our community is able to receive care locally that they were otherwise leaving the community for,\u201d Thorsen said. \u201cI could not recruit cardiologists and oncologists to live and work in Astoria without the partnership we have with OHSU.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Daily Astorian", "description": "Oregon Health & Science University has taken over staffing at Columbia Memorial Hospital\u2019s emergency care.The hospital\u2019s contract with North Coast Emergency Physicians, which had provided staffing for more than 20 years, ended Sept. 30, and OHSU\u2019s doctors took over the next", "title": "OHSU provides stability to local emergency room", "url": "http://www.dailyastorian.com/Local_News/20151014/ohsu-provides-stability-to-local-emergency-room", "image": "http://www.dailyastorian.com/storyimage/DA/20151014/ARTICLE/151019941/AR/0/AR-151019941.jpg&MaxW=600", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/DailyAstorian"}, "description": "Read OHSU provides stability to local emergency room from The Daily Astorian", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Joshua Bessex/The Daily Astorian Dr. Larry Zagata shows an exam room in the emergency room area of the Columbia Memorial Hospital Tuesday.\nBuy this photo Joshua Bessex/The Daily Astorian The Columbia Memorial Hospital emergency room is a Level IV trauma center.\nBuy this photoOregon Health & Science University has taken over staffing at Columbia Memorial Hospital\u2019s emergency care.\nOregon Health & Science University now staffs Columbia Memorial Hospital's emergency care department.\nColumbia Memorial also takes trauma patients from the coverage area of Providence Seaside, which is not equipped as a trauma center."}
