U.S. Sens. Jay Rockerfeller and Claire McCaskill on Wednesday sent letters to Apple /quotes/zigman/68270/delayed /quotes/zigman/68270/lastsale AAPL CEO Tim Cook and Home Depot /quotes/zigman/229488/delayed /quotes/zigman/229488/lastsale HD CEO Francis Blake on the recent revelations over hacking at the two companies. In Apple’s case, it concerned celebrity nude photos stored on its iCloud service, while stolen credit and debit cards on the black market may have come from Home Depot.

Rockefeller, the West Virginia Democrat, is chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee. Missouri Democrat McCaskill is chairman of the subcommittee on consumer protection.

In the letters, the senators noted the introduction of the Apple Watch, which will enable the collection of consumer health data and encourage increased mobile commerce, as well as its new iCloud Drive initiative. “While reports of unauthorized access to iCloud accounts have been sensationalized and have largely focused on its impact on high-profile celebrities, the incident may be another example of potential security vulnerabilities as illustrated in a string of recent data breaches that have put millions of American consumers at risk,” they wrote Cook.

They have previously requested information from Target /quotes/zigman/253872/delayed /quotes/zigman/253872/lastsale TGT and Neiman Marcus.
