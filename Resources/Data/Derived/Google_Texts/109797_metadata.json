The president acknowledged having failed at \u201cthe theater\u201d of presidential leadership and, after a fashion, turned to new, more dramatic language about his incremental escalation of the effort to contain Islamist militants who keep beheading Westerners in their captivity. While White House officials briefing reporters on Monday said they wouldn\u2019t be running on the ISIS war, per se, they expressed satisfaction that the president\u2019s new more resolute persona had stabilized things with voters. The briefers laid out the events of weeks to come designed to highlight the president\u2019s new part. As lawmakers gnaw on a proposal to provide more arms to rival rebel factions in Syria, the president is getting ready to take his show on the road, with stops in Atlanta to show engagement on the expanding threat of the Ebola virus and in Florida where he will visit military commanders.\n\n\n\n[What will 100 grand buy you? - President Obama was the guest of honor Monday night at a Democratic Senate fundraiser with the amazing price of $100,000 per attendee at the posh Jefferson Hotel]\n\n\n\nOn the home front - But while the president has altered his playbill to indicate attentiveness to national security issues, he and his party also have been deploying new measures against Republicans as the midterm season heats up. And it seems to be working. Democrats are seeing returns on a strategy to use superior financial resources to attack Republicans for trying to buy elections. As today\u2019s fundraising totals show, well-heeled Democrats are dumping far more money into keeping the Senate than Republicans and their allies are putting into trying to win it. Having spent so heavily in the early going to blunt the bucks of conservatives, the president and his team are carefully turning toward rallying the Democratic base. Obama\u2019s campaign schedule is taking shape and the president has cut his first ads of the general election season, radio spots aimed at black voters and single women.\n\n\n\nSeven weeks - How\u2019s it going? Despite abysmal polls for the president and deep frustrations with Democratic polices, the party seems to be staving off catastrophe. Are Republicans counting Senate chickens before they\u2019re hatched and not donating and mobilizing? Will a late surge in spending by pro-GOP groups change the landscape? There are just seven weeks to find out.\n\n\n\nNew Normal: Dem incumbents benefitting from national gloom - American Enterprise Institute data mavens Karlyn Bowman and Jennifer Marsico explain how voters can be so deeply dissatisfied with the direction of the country and its governance but still not storming to the polls to boot out incumbents: As in the 2012 election, a new normal of lowered expectations and resignation \u201cto a less bright future at home and abroad.\u201d Their forecast is for GOP gains, but tempered by a defeatist spirit about the future. \u201cA lot can change between now and the November 4 elections. But it seems to us that right now that passive dissatisfaction is the order of the day, rather than an active, energized one that brings many voters to the polls,\u201d the pair wrote. \u201cThat may be why the polls in so many hot Senate contests this fall aren\u2019t moving much.\u201d\n\n\n\nSay anything - The impeccably sourced David Drucker explains one reason why Democrats are doing better \u2013 they\u2019re staying focused: \u201cOutside liberal groups are running more effective ads in key Senate races by sticking to the script, while conservative groups focus too much on their own agendas, Republican strategists say. While many conservative groups focus on their traditional messages, left-leaning super PACs and nonprofits are working together and tailoring their ads to the themes Democrats are campaigning on, allowing them to reinforce the candidates' messages \u2014 and the party's overall arguments about the election. \u2018When it comes to aligning their message and coordinating activities, the left gets it better than anyone,\u2019 a senior GOP strategist confided to the Washington Examiner. \u2018Labor groups will run ads about contraception if that will help them win. It\u2019s not just how much you spend but how you spend it. Our groups rarely get outside their comfort zone.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nBAIER TRACKS: LONG WEEK \u2026\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s only Tuesday and the bad foreign policy news seems to be piling up. The ISIS coalition looks shaky at best, President Obama\u2019s push to get the Defense Department to fight Ebola suggests a bigger threat than first appreciated, Iran seems emboldened in the current environment, China is increasingly willing to push back against U.S. interests and North Korea is starting to act out again. Needless to say, the U.S. does not need any more headaches abroad. But Afghanistan is essentially falling apart, both politically and militarily. The June 14 Afghan election is still unresolved and now, the Afghan military may start splitting up and choosing sides between the two rival candidates. The infighting has allowed the Taliban to \u2013 as crazy as it sounds \u2013 take the political high ground. A deteriorating Afghanistan as US troops start to leave there would join a deteriorating Iraq and an Islamist army trying to set up a caliphate. And it's only Tuesday.\u201d \u2013 Bret Baier\n\n\n\nGRIMES GRABS HER GUN\n\nRoll Call: \u201cThe latest television spot from [Kentucky Democratic Senate candidate] Alison Lundergan Grimes shows her skeet shooting on a farm as part of the Senate nominee\u2019s attempt to create distance with an unpopular president in the midterms\u2026 In the spot, after firing a few rounds at clay pigeons, Grimes looks at the camera and says \u2018I\u2019m not Barack Obama. I disagree with him on guns, coal and the EPA.\u2019 The ad, which according to the campaign is backed by a significant buy in the six-figure range.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut assailed over amnesty - The conservative group Kentucky Opportunity Coalition is attacking Allison Lundergan Grimes in a new ad seeking to tie her to President Obama\u2019s immigration agenda saying, \u201cAllison Grimes, proud supporter of Obama\u2019s amnesty plan\u2026their plan citizenship for millions who broke the law, illegal immigrants would become eligible for taxpayer funded benefits.\u201d\n\n\n\nUDALL TRIES DIRECT-TO-CAM ATTACK ON GARDNER\n\nSen. Mark Udall, D-Colo., goes first person in his attack on challenger Rep. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., over Gardner\u2019s pro-life stance suggesting he is stuck in the past in a new ad . Udall appears in the ad saying, \u201cHow is it that we are still debating a woman\u2019s access to abortion or birth control. For most of us, those debates got settled by the last generation.\u201d\n\n\n\nCrossroads hits Udall on pandering - Washington Examiner: \u201cOne of the leading pro-Republican outside groups will try to chip away at Sen. Mark Udall\u2019s support among women with a new ad launching Tuesday. Crossroads GPS, the nonprofit arm of the Karl Rove-backed group American Crossroads, will debut a television advertisement throughout Colorado urging women voters to \u2018vote \u2018no\u2019 on Mark Udall.\u2019 \u2026 The ad, \u2018Talk,\u2019 features four women chatting around a kitchen island about the upcoming election. \u2018We aren\u2019t single-issue voters,\u2019 one woman says. \u2018We care about good jobs that support our families.\u2019 \u2018Shouldn\u2019t Mark Udall talk about the issues?\u2019 another offers....The ad marks the opening salvo in a $6 million blitz Crossroads GPS has planned for Colorado through the end of October.\u201d\n\n\n\nPERDUE GETS BUSH SENIOR\u2019S BACKING\n\nAJC: \u201c[Former president] George H.W. Bush endorsed Republican David Perdue in [Georgia\u2019s Senate race]\u2026 Democrat Michelle Nunn has invoked her ties to the elder Bush in ads and campaign rhetoric.\u201d\n\n\n\n[The latest WSB-TV survey continues to show a close race with Democrat Michelle Nunn leading Republican David Perdue 46 percent to 43 percent.]\n\n\n\nSULLIVAN BLASTS \u2018BOTH WAYS BEGICH\u2019\n\nAlaska Republican Senate hopeful Dan Sullivan is releasing a new ad in conjunction with the launch of BothWaysBegich.com, attacking Mark Begich\u2019s flip flopping record saying, \u201cIn Alaska, Begich claims he\u2019s a \u2018thorn in Obama\u2019s side,\u2019 but in Washington, he votes with Obama 97 percent of the time\u2026Mark Begich isn\u2019t true Alaska, he's pure Washington.\u201d\n\n\n\nPICK SIX: TWICE AS MANY?\n\nRepublicans need six more Senate seats to take control of the upper chamber.

Here are the top picks among Fox News First readers: Arkansas (13.7%), Montana (13.0%), West Virginia (12.1%), Louisiana (11.7%), South Dakota (9.9%) and North Carolina (9.6%). Reader Ken Dargis of Wilmington, Delaware, is a Democrat who thinks that his deep blue home state will be a real indicator of problems for his party this fall and wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the GOP took 12 seats.\n\n\n\nShare your top six picks.

Chris Smith, R-N.J., said Monday...In its report, the GAO found that 23 states restrict how insurance plans offered in the ObamaCare exchanges may include abortion as a benefit, and 28 do not. The GAO then surveyed 18 insurance providers within the 28 states that do not restrict abortion coverage to determine how the coverage is being handled. According to the GAO, 17 of the 18 providers surveyed said they were not billing policyholders separately for the abortion coverage.\u201d\n\n\n\nWITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE...\n\nWhat is the world\u2019s most famous Christian band? Hint: Their latest album was automatically downloaded to your iTunes account last week. New Yorker\u2019s Joshua Rothman digs into theology and complicated cultural role of U2, led by devout Christians who often sing their faith, but seek to stay relevant in a secular audience. But there are reasons beyond just branding and marketing. Rothman writes: \u201cMuch of the confusion around U2\u2019s faith stems from the fact that they\u2019ve never been an \u2018officially\u2019 Christian rock band. The ambiguity goes back to the band\u2019s origins, in the Dublin of the late seventies, during the Troubles. In a country divided along sectarian lines, little about organized religion was attractive.\u201d As the great Danish author Hans Christian Anderson once said, \u201cWhere words fall, music speaks.\u201d\n\n\n\nPOLL CHECK\n\nReal Clear Politics Averages\n\nObama Job Approval: Approve \u2013 41.3 percent//Disapprove \u2013 54.2 percent\n\nDirection of Country: Right Direction \u2013 26.4 percent//Wrong Track \u2013 65.1 percent\n\nGeneric Congressional Ballot: Democrats \u2013 42.7 percent// Republicans \u2013 45.7 percent\n\n\n\n-- 49 days until Nov. 4 --\n\n\n\nFIRST IN FOX NEWS FIRST: NRCC RAMPS UP WITH SIX NEW SPOTS\n\nNew today: The National Republican Campaign Committee is launching ads in six races today, on the attack in five Democrat-held districts and on defense in one GOP-controlled district.

Nick Joe Rahall, D-W.Va., has seen it before, but he\u2019s going to see it many times more in his coal-rich, socially conservative district: President Obama publicly praising the congressman, one of his earliest and most vocal supporters in the Mountain State.

The 10 state \u201cWe the People, We the Voters\u201d bus tour, organized by the liberal activists, plans to engage voters at 75 events in 36 cities along the 5,252-mile route. Biden is billing taxpayers for the trip since it is deemed an \u201cofficial visit.\u201d Biden, who just a year ago delivered a red meat speech that teased 2016 intentions as the star of the Harkin steak fry, has taken a back seat this year in Hawkeye State.

[and Fox host] Mike Huckabee (R) is taking the necessary steps to run for president again in 2016, vowing he wouldn\u2019t make the same mistakes he made last time, if he pulls the trigger. The Republican told a group of reporters on Monday over coffee at a restaurant just outside of D.C. that he learned from his failed 2008 bid that he can\u2019t take money and fundraising for granted, even though he is leading in GOP early primary state polls\u2026 Huckabee said he\u2019s in talks with donors, and, \u2018with a lot of people, it\u2019s [going] pretty good.\u2019 He pointed to the nonprofit, America Takes Action, which he recently set up that, he says, has already raised seven figures. \u2018Not a single person I\u2019ve asked [to contribute to the group] has said no,\u2019 he told reporters. A new CNN/ORC poll out Monday gave Huckabee 21 percent support among GOP voters in Iowa \u2014 almost twice as much as the next-strongest contender, Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), with 12 percent support \u2014 and his supporters argue a Huckabee presidential candidacy is looking more viable than it has in the past.\u201d\n\n\n\n[Washington Examiner\u2019s Byron York considers how Mike Huckabee may be gearing up a 2016 run.]\n\n\n\nNew in Fox News Opinion - Potential 2016 GOP contender Gov.

But just a spritz of \u201cpig perfume\u201d will do the trick, according to a recent study. John McGlone, a Texas Tech scientist created the scent while looking for a way to train his dog out of non-stop barking. \u201cWe sprayed it in their nose or toward their head while they were barking\u2026barking and jumping, running back and forth,\u201d he said. \u201cThis whole behavior stopped. You could almost see them thinking, \u2018What was that?\u2019\u201d McGlone hopes it is used as training method rather than a circus trick. He is continuing to test scents released by other animals to see if there is any benefit in the commercial marketplace.\n\nAND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES\u2026\n\n\u201cThis is called a coalition of the unwilling\u2026 [President Obama] telegraphed it in his speech, everybody understands: He\u2019s ambivalent.
