Bill sponsor Councilmember David Greenfield called the private school handout \u201cimportant public policy.\u201d He also lambasted dissenters with the comment that the city is \u201cflush with cash.\u201d\n\nIt won favor, in a vote 43 to 4, with the argument that all students deserve to feel safe. But our city students also deserve a quality education, something that the City Council is failing to support with its favoring of private schools over public schools.\n\nGreenfield dismissed skeptics saying that the city\u2019s glut of cash allows flexibility in spending. He also insinuated that there is more than enough money to cover public schools. So what\u2019s the problem with bestowing several million onto private schools?\n\nThere are plenty of problems. The main one is this: Our city\u2019s public schools are ailing financially. And this has resulted in staggering inequities between public schools and those of well-heeled private schools.\n\nNew York City public schools, despite their best efforts to expand programs and opportunities like Career and Technical Education classes and afterschool activities for their students, have been limping along for decades. Much of the blame can be laid at the feet of the state, which owes the city\u2019s public schools $2 billion in Campaign for Fiscal Equity funding. If New York City is rolling in riches, as Greenfield states, why then is the City Council not easing the burden of our cash-strapped public schools?\n\nThis is vital because lack of educational opportunity limits potential. Countless students attend schools with outdated technology or no technology at all. Arts and music programs have been cut and the lack of resources and opportunity for growth has caused many quality teachers to opt for a different district or a different career. Some schools are so overcrowded that students are relegated to classrooms in trailers.\n\nHow about the cash-flush City Council funding a free lunch program, musical instruments or computers for our public schools students? How about paying for guidance counselors to help students apply for college to pursue their dreams\u2014we have a scarcity in New York City with only one counselor for every 200 students.\n\nThere is also a constitutional question. Doesn\u2019t funding private schools with public dollars violate our founders\u2019 tenet of separation of church and state? This blurring of lines, between public and private, sets up our city for more funding of pet projects where the trail of public money might not be able to be followed.\n\nFurthermore, it\u2019s shameful that our City Council leaders would fold under the pressure of private and religious schools.\n\nWhile the City Council fawns over private schools, our public school children battle some of the biggest disparities in the state, perhaps in the nation. Half of our public school children live in poverty. Don\u2019t they deserve a chance to dig out?\n\nFinally, all this comes at a time when private and religious schools are lobbying hard at the state level for a tax credit that would cost taxpayers $250 million a year. The City Council\u2019s unprecedented vote opens the floodgates for well-endowed private schools to continue to eat away at the public coffers.\n\nOur City Council should be insisting that public dollars are reserved for public schools. A City flush with cash should provide more opportunities for all children, not just those who are politically well-connected.\n\n\u2014\n\nZakiyah Ansari, Advocacy Director, Alliance for Quality Education\n\nThe Alliance for Quality Education is a coalition whose mission is to mobilize communities across the state to keep New York true to its promise of ensuring a high quality public education to all students regardless of zip code.", "article_metadata": {"description": "OPINION: NY City Council must do more for public schools", "rights": "Copyright 2015 | Everything Brooklyn Media", "og": {"image": "http://www.brooklyneagle.com/sites/default/files/pages/separate-but-unequal.jpg"}, "twitter": {"widgets": {"csp": "on"}}, "robots": "follow, index, noarchive", "keywords": "NYC Council, Public Schools, Public Education, NYC, Brooklyn", "abstract": "OPINION: NY City Council must do more for public schools", "news_keywords": "NYC Council, Public Schools, Public Education, NYC, Brooklyn"}, "article_summary": "But our city students also deserve a quality education, something that the City Council is failing to support with its favoring of private schools over public schools.\nOur City Council should be insisting that public dollars are reserved for public schools.\nHow about the cash-flush City Council funding a free lunch program, musical instruments or computers for our public schools students?\nAnd this has resulted in staggering inequities between public schools and those of well-heeled private schools.\nIf New York City is rolling in riches, as Greenfield states, why then is the City Council not easing the burden of our cash-strapped public schools?"}
