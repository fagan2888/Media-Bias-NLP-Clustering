I am leading in Pennsylvania \u2014 I love Pennsylvania. I am leading in Ohio.\u201d\n\nReal estate mogul and reality television star Trump delivered the speech to a near-capacity crowd of 1,500 at the Treasure Island Hotel and Casino\u2019s Mystere Theater, blasting the media and his political opponents alike.\n\nTrump\u2019s criticism of the news as dishonest \u2014 saying cameras \u201cnever pan the room\" \u2014 drew a strong reaction from audience members who stood up and cheered, booed and pushed their way in view of the dozen or so TV cameras set up in the middle of the theater.\n\nHe also called former First Lady Hillary Clinton and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush \u201cmeek, pathetic and sad people\u201d and took swipes at other GOP presidential candidates including Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham and former CEO Carly Fiorina.\n\nTouting himself as a \u201cratings machine,\u201d Trump crowed about the amount of coverage his bid had received. \u201cI think I am on 14 covers this month,\u201d he said. \u201cI am on more covers than any supermodel in history.\u201d\n\nTrump pulled Colombian immigrant and Las Vegas resident Myriam Witcher up onto the stage, who had with her a copy of People magazine featuring Trump on the cover. Trump, who said he had never met her before, told her \u201cyou are beautiful,\u201d autographed the magazine and gave her a hug and a kiss.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s my relationship with Hispanics,\u201d Trump said.\n\nIn an interview before the rally, Witcher said she supports Trump\u2019s plan to deport all immigrants here without legal status. She said she had to wait five years for a visa and that she and her family have \u201crespect for the Constitution and rules.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Hispanic, Latina, and I love me some Trump,\u201d Witcher said in the interview. \u201cHe\u2019s the perfect man, a businessman.\u201d\n\nTrump promised to repeal the Affordable Care Act, establish a more muscular foreign policy and to balance the nation\u2019s budget. The candidate is traveling across the country to garner support in advance of the Republican\u2019s first nominating contests in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada.\n\nAfter rising in national polls throughout the summer, Trump\u2019s level has receded somewhat, but not enough for one of his challengers to overtake him.\n\nThe crowd largely matched Trump\u2019s emotional tenor throughout his speech, booing at mentions of China, ISIS, Russia, the Common Core and Washington bureaucrats and applauding at promises to repeal the Affordable Care Act, mentions that Trump is funding his own campaign and jabs at other presidential candidates.\n\nAt various points, members of the audience \u2014 some clad in Trump t-shirts or sporting red \u201cmake America great again\u201d hats \u2014 shouted \u201cwe need you\u201d and \u201cI love you.\u201d\n\nSome supporters who attended the speech said Trump\u2019s stance on immigration first piqued their interest. Others said it was his business acumen. Almost all said they prefer Trump to other Republican candidates because he was not a professional politician.\n\n\u201cWe need to think outside the box. We need a non-politician in office,\u201d said Frank Dobbs, who has lived in Las Vegas for 16 years. \u201cHe seems to be running his own campaign while others seem like they\u2019re being told what to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur leaders are incompetent,\u201d Trump said to applause.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Real estate mogul and reality television star Donald Trump delivered the speech to a near-capacity crowd of 1,500 at Treasure Island, blasting the media and ...", "og": {"site_name": "LasVegasSun.com", "description": "Real estate mogul and reality television star Donald Trump delivered the speech to a near-capacity crowd of 1,500 at Treasure Island, blasting the media and ...", "title": "Trump to Las Vegas: \u2018Our leaders are incompetent\u2019", "url": "//lasvegassun.com/news/2015/oct/08/trump-to-las-vegas-our-leaders-are-incompetent/", "image": "http://photos.lasvegassun.com/media/img/photos/2015/10/08/20151008_Sun_Trump_Treasure_Island_LE525_t378.jpg?42670983c634e7c20626cc4856c543752c0d8b2f", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "//photos.lasvegassun.com/media/img/photos/2015/10/08/20151008_Sun_Trump_Treasure_Island_LE525_r100x100.jpg?b3c07ccb2170322b6086abdb714037205a461b06", "creator": "@MeganMesserly", "site": "@LasVegasSun", "card": "summary", "account_id": 12055942}, "fb": {"app_id": 112951308742607}, "vr": {"type": "text"}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-08T13:36", "author": "//lasvegassun.com/staff/kyle-roerink/"}, "verify-v1": "ABQIAAAA8L3JFDSZBbRKiOI0oC2hURQtzf2N5nUcl5FoJ4HJzSUUnGQdoBRCXoBzqBg3VizzahR0b1gDldhrew", "y_key": "33c272341f5beade"}, "article_summary": "Trump to Las Vegas: \u2018Our leaders are incompetent\u2019Related Story Crowd gathers to hear Trump speech in Las VegasAt his speech today in Las Vegas, Republican frontrunner Donald Trump had a simple message for his supporters: He\u2019s a winner.\nWe need a non-politician in office,\u201d said Frank Dobbs, who has lived in Las Vegas for 16 years.\n\u201cHe seems to be running his own campaign while others seem like they\u2019re being told what to do.\u201d\u201cOur leaders are incompetent,\u201d Trump said to applause.\n\u201cI am on more covers than any supermodel in history.\u201dTrump pulled Colombian immigrant and Las Vegas resident Myriam Witcher up onto the stage, who had with her a copy of People magazine featuring Trump on the cover.\nTouting himself as a \u201cratings machine,\u201d Trump crowed about the amount of coverage his bid had received."}
