Gretzky, who began his pro career the previous season in the WHA, was limited to an assist, but it gave him at least one point in six consecutive games. The streak reached 12 games before he was kept off the scoresheet at Montreal on Jan. 7, 1980 \u2014 19 days before his 19th birthday.\n\nThat was a little-noted run in what turned out to be the illustrious career of the NHL\u2019s greatest player ever. Gretzky went on to win the Hart Trophy as the league\u2019s MVP that season \u2026 and the next seven seasons too.\n\nSo if Avalanche forward Nathan MacKinnon last week seemed sheepish to be talking about equaling (at Chicago) then bettering (at Detroit) Gretzky\u2019s previous league-best consecutive game point streak for an 18-year-old, it was understandable and also testament to his under-control ego. As his teammates teasingly called him or greeted him with \u201cGretzky!\u201d, MacKinnon repeatedly acknowledged how \u201ccool\u201d it was to be mentioned with No. 99.\n\nMacKinnon\u2019s streak ended at 13 games Saturday, when he didn\u2019t get a goal or an assist in the Avalanche\u2019s 2-1 loss to St. Louis. But at least in one spot of the NHL\u2019s archives, he always will be ahead of Gretzky.\n\n\u201cI never cared about the streak, I don\u2019t think,\u201d a somber MacKinnon said after Saturday\u2019s game at the Pepsi Center. \u201cIt\u2019s just a point streak. I want to help the team any way I can. I have to do a better job.\u201d\n\nThrough 64 games, MacKinnon has 22 goals and 29 assists and is the runaway leader in NHL rookie scoring, making him the favorite to claim the Calder Trophy as the league\u2019s rookie of the year. A natural center, he has been playing wing of late on the Paul Stastny-centered line. Stastny, who was 20 when he joined the Avalanche in 2006, has the franchise\u2019s longest rookie scoring streak ever (20 games), and that\u2019s still the longest in the NHL since 1998-99. Stastny played one shift Saturday before leaving with a back injury, and if he\u2019s unavailable for any length of time, MacKinnon likely will be playing center.\n\nAt least at this point, it seems the Avalanche made the right move bypassing what would have been a popular choice \u2014 defenseman Seth Jones, the son of former Nuggets player Popeye Jones \u2014 and drafting MacKinnon with the No. 1 overall choice last June.\n\nCrosby from Cole Harbour too\n\nIt also has been much noted that MacKinnon comes from Cole Harbour, the same Nova Scotia hometown as the NHL\u2019s current top player, Pittsburgh Penguins center Sidney Crosby. But one of the overlooked aspects of his story is that Avalanche coach Patrick Roy, previously the part-owner, general manager and coach of major junior hockey\u2019s Quebec Remparts, once before tried to land MacKinnon, but failed. This time, Roy wasn\u2019t going to let MacKinnon get away.\n\nActually, city labels \u2014 whether in reference to Cole Harbour or other communities in the Halifax area \u2014 are tricky because of mergers into the Halifax Regional Municipality, but MacKinnon was raised in the Bel Ayr neighborhood and played in the Cole Harbour Bel Ayr Minor Hockey Association programs. He got Crosby\u2019s autograph many times and had posters and pictures of Crosby playing at virtually every level. \u201cWhen I get home, I\u2019ll have to take that stuff down now. I think it\u2019s time,\u201d MacKinnon said recently.\n\nIn 2009, MacKinnon did what Crosby had done in 2002, leaving home to attend Shattuck-St. Mary\u2019s School in Faribault, Minn. \u201cI actually went a year earlier than he did to Shattuck,\u201d MacKinnon said. \u201cHe played midget at 14 at home and then went to Shattuck at 15. I went to Shattuck at 14 and never played midget at home.\u201d\n\nMacKinnon stayed at Shattuck-St. Mary\u2019s two years, playing for the school\u2019s Bantam AAA and Midget AAA teams. \u201cI loved it,\u201d he said. \u201cMy first year was grade nine. Living in a dorm with a roommate was different. The best part was that everybody was together all the time. You lived with your friends, you ate with them, you went to school with them, you played hockey with them, and I got pretty close to them.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was going to go to Omaha\u201d\n\nMacKinnon then was eligible for the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League draft. Playing junior hockey in the United States Hockey League instead would enable him to preserve his eligibility to receive a scholarship to play in an NCAA program. Or he could go to the QMJHL and major junior, where the stipends that players receive cause the NCAA to consider them professionals and ineligible to play U.S. college hockey.\n\nHe still was only 15 at the time, but prominent player agent Pat Brisson already was his \u201cadviser.\u201d Showily emphasizing his leverage, Mac- Kinnon skated with the Omaha Lancers of the USHL on the QMJHL draft day. The Lancers earlier had taken MacKinnon in the USHL draft.\n\nThen he went to Baie-Comeau in the QMJHL draft. That city, about 250 miles northeast of Quebec City, is primarily French-speaking, and the team was terrible. \u201cIf Baie-Comeau wasn\u2019t going to trade me, I was going to go to Omaha,\u201d Mac- Kinnon said. \u201cThe owner is a good friend of my agent and it would have been a good situation for me. I was in Omaha, skating with the team, so I was serious about it. I had a blast there and I liked the city. I was all set to go there. I figured Baie-Comeau would trade me eventually, that it would be in everyone\u2019s interests. If it would have been the next summer, I would have played a year in Omaha.\u201d\n\nIf he had stayed in Omaha for two seasons, he at least would have kept open the option of NCAA hockey \u2014 beginning in, yes, the 2013-14 season. \u201cI\u2019d be in my first year in college this season,\u201d MacKinnon said, smiling, \u201cand I\u2019d rather be in the NHL than college, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d\n\nThe MacKinnons had let it be known they would prefer that Baie-Comeau trade his rights to his hometown Halifax Mooseheads, but at least two other QMJHL teams would have been acceptable and were in the mix \u2014 the Saint John (New Brunswick) Seadogs and Roy\u2019s Quebec Remparts. \u201cIt would have been funny if I\u2019d played there and we came together here,\u201d MacKinnon said. \u201cBut Patrick told me Baie-Comeau wouldn\u2019t have traded me to Quebec.\u201d\n\nRoy said he asked Brisson if MacKinnon would be interested in possibly playing for Quebec. \u201cHe said yes and from there, I approached Baie-Comeau,\u201d the Avalanche coach recalled.\n\nHow close did Roy come to acquiring MacKinnon\u2019s rights back then?\n\n\u201cNot close at all,\u201d Roy recalled. \u201cI inquired, I checked, but I knew he was going to play (major junior) only two years. To pay as much as it would have been was too expensive. It would have been a lot of draft picks. I would have had to give too much in assets. We were in the process of rebuilding. There was no need for us to pay that much for Nate. It would have been nice to have Nate, but we would have had no defense and it would be a tough trade to make. Halifax was in a better position and it worked well for them and it worked well for Nate, because he was playing in his hometown. I knew he was going to be very special.\u201d\n\nMajor scorer with Mooseheads\n\nThe Mooseheads acquired MacKinnon\u2019s rights July 11, 2011, giving up two players and three first-round draft choices.\n\nWith the Mooseheads, MacKinnon was an immediate hit, getting his first hat trick against Roy\u2019s Remparts. He played for Roy and the QMJHL all-stars in the Subway Super Series against Team Russia. \u201cI enjoyed that,\u201d Roy said. \u201cHe was asking me questions, what do you think of this, what do you think of that. We\u2019ve talked about that and it makes him laugh more than me.\u201d\n\nIn two seasons with the Mooseheads, often going against Roy\u2019s Remparts, MacKinnon had 63 goals in 102 regular-season games and 24 in 17 playoff games.\n\nHis draft stock fluctuated during the 2012-13 season, and he slid from the top of most lists and fell below Jones when he had an unimpressive showing in the World Junior Championships and coped with a knee issue cleaned up in a minor procedure at The Steadman Clinic in Vail. But he closed with a rush, and the exclamation point came when he had a hat trick as the Mooseheads defeated Jones and Portland in the Memorial Cup championship game. The International Scouting Service put him back ahead of Jones on the draft list, while the NHL\u2019s Central Scouting bureau still had Jones at the top.\n\nThe Avalanche, by then with Joe Sakic at the top of its hockey operations, along with Roy \u2014 also the team\u2019s vice president of hockey operations \u2014 recalling what he had seen of MacKinnon for two seasons, took the speedy center.\n\nAnd the rest is \u2026 well, most of the history remains to be written. But MacKinnon already has made a bit of it.\n\nTerry Frei: tfrei@denverpost.com\n\nNathan mackinnon\u2019s point streak\n\n1, Jan. 25 at Tampa Bay \u2026\u2026..0 goals, 1 assist, 1 point\n\n2, Jan. 27 at Dallas\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..1-0-1\n\n3, Jan. 30 vs. Minnesota\u2026\u2026\u2026.1-1-2\n\n4, Feb. 1 vs. Buffalo\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.1-2-3\n\n5, Feb. 3 at New Jersey\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.0-1-1\n\n6, Feb. 4 at NY Rangers\u2026\u2026\u2026..0-1-1\n\n7, Feb. 6 at Philadelphia\u2026\u2026\u2026..1-0-1\n\n8, Feb. 8 at NY Islanders\u2026\u2026\u2026.1-0-1\n\n9, Feb. 26 vs. Los Angeles\u2026\u2026..0-1-1\n\n10, Feb. 28 vs. Phoenix\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.0-2-2\n\n11, March 2 vs. Tampa Bay\u2026\u2026.0-2-2\n\n12, March 4 at Chicago\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.0-1-1\n\n13, March 6 at Detroit\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u20260-1-1", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd58f\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI never cared about the streak, I don\u2019t think,\u201d a somber MacKinnon said after Saturday\u2019s game at the Pepsi Center.\nAs his teammates teasingly called him or greeted him with \u201cGretzky!\u201d, MacKinnon repeatedly acknowledged how \u201ccool\u201d it was to be mentioned with No.\nThe 18-year-old already long had been considered a hockey phenom, and he was about to play in Denver for the first time.\nGretzky went on to win the Hart Trophy as the league\u2019s MVP that season \u2026 and the next seven seasons too.\nThis time, Roy wasn\u2019t going to let MacKinnon get away."}
