- There have been plenty of Obamacare/Healthcare.gov related jokes to go along with the WWE Network issues today. WWE's own Zeb Colter chimed in on Twitter:

"BREAKING NEWS: IT IS BEING REPORTED THAT MORE PEOPLE HAVE ALREADY SIGNED UP FOR @WWENetwork THAN HAVE JOINED @HealthCareGov. @WWE"

"PLEASE BE PATIENT [email protected] UNLIKE @HealthCareGov IT REALLY IS AFFORDABLE...AND WORTH THE WAIT. #WeThePeople @WWE @JCLayfield"

- Steve Austin noted that part 1 of his interview with William Regal will be released on PodcastOne and iTunes tomorrow.

- WWE has taken down their previous announcement about the Network technical problems. We've heard from a lot of customers in the past hour who have finally been able to sign-up and connect.
