Back then, he didn\u2019t think he could ever have a family, since it was illegal for HIV-positive men to donate sperm. California reversed that law in 2007. Now, Jolivette hopes to start a family with a friend. As part of our ongoing series of first-person health profiles called \u201cWhat\u2019s Your Story?\u201d Jolivette tells us how some medical facilities still can\u2019t handle this kind of situation.\n\nBy Andrew Jolivette\n\nYou know, my mother passed away about a year ago and I think that that also, in all honesty, has had some impact on me saying: Well gosh, she was such a great mom and all these things she taught me, I want to be able to share that with someone, too.\n\nQuite frankly, because [my viral load is] undetectable and there are measures they can take like sperm washing and the potential mother, can take anti-retrovirals beforehand to ensure that she nor the child will be infected, then why not?\n\nBut the first response after we both did fertility tests, they said, well, as you know you\u2019re HIV positive, so we don\u2019t really have the capacity to do that here. So what they suggested, which I found rather insulting, was that we actually do insemination at home. I took that to mean \u2014 that whole sort of outdated thing, it\u2019s the stereotype when people say, you go get a turkey-baster type thing.\n\nReally, if we\u2019re talking about people having equal rights to health care, if you\u2019re performing these services for other people who aren\u2019t (HIV) positive, then you should be performing these services for people who are positive.\n\nThey need to be prepared. If it\u2019s been six years and you\u2019re aware of the law, then why haven\u2019t you done more to make this accessible to people who want to have children and raise families?\n\nRelated: Re-thinking Unprotected Sex for HIV-Positive Men Who Want Children\n\nListen to Jolivette\u2019s story:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Andrew Jolivette wants to start a family but because he is HIV-positive, he is having a hard time finding a place that will help him donate sperm to his friend.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Tough Road to Starting a Family for HIV-Positive Man\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2013\\/10\\/17\\/tough-road-to-starting-a-family-for-hiv-positive-man\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2013-10-17 09:34:47\",\"mod_date\":\"2014-02-12 16:00:37\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":15728,\"author_id\":\"1462\",\"author_name\":\"Ryder Diaz\",\"author_display_name\":\"Ryder Diaz\",\"tags\":[\"AIDS\",\"HIV\",\"Vital Signs\"],\"categories\":[\"Community Health\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2013\\/10\\/IMG_6494-2-e1381958343292.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "Editor\u2019s note: Andrew Jolivette was diagnosed with AIDS eleven years ago.
