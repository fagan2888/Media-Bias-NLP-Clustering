In comparison, the 2016 penalty for lack of insurance is $695 per person or 2.5% of income\n\nSteve D. Wood, ACR Health\u2019s assistant director of support services for insurance programs, said people can enroll in the plan beginning Nov. 1.\n\nInsurers offering the plan include Excellus BlueCross BlueShield, Fidelis Care and United Healthcare.\n\nRecommended Reading\n\nWRVO: Low-cost health insurance plan aimed at young New Yorkers\n\nWatertown Daily Times: New \u2018Essential Plan\u2019 offers free, inexpensive health insurance for low wage earners", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Heather Caspi", "twitter": {"domain": "Healthcare Dive", "site": "@healthcaredive", "card": "summary"}, "featured": "False", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/cache/e6/4b/e64b68d3f366726ee7b5afbadbc7228b.jpg", "sailthru.tags": "healthcare,type-newspost,healthcare-payer", "news_keywords": "Payer", "category": "News Post", "title": "New low-cost health plan targets young New Yorkers", "pub_date": "oct 23, 2015", "section": "news", "sailthru.date": "2015-10-23T08:00:00", "content_boost": 4, "touched": "True", "article_date_original": "Friday, October 23, 2015, 08:00 AM", "medium": "news", "description": "Healthcare", "sailthru.expire_date": "2025-10-10T08:00:00", "teaser": "<p>With premiums of $0 or $20, the plan hopes to appeal to millennials&nbsp;who aren&#39;t working full time yet.</p>", "sponsored": "False", "date": "2015-10-23", "sailthru.description": "With premiums of $0 or $20, the plan hopes to appeal to millennials\u00a0who aren't working full time yet.", "viewport": "width=986", "og": {"site_name": "Healthcare Dive", "description": "With premiums of $0 or $20, the plan hopes to appeal to millennials\u00a0who aren't working full time yet.", "title": "New low-cost health plan targets young New Yorkers", "url": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/news/new-low-cost-health-plan-targets-young-new-yorkers/407861/", "image": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/diveimage/wpid-Featured_Picture523-620x413.jpg", "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "aN-77CvDv8Rt4OQnHMaUSm6V87TF8ri5GDUv93p7pHk", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/cache/a4/61/a461837d13867065bd33dcacac94b6e7.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd1fe\"", "article_summary": "Recommended ReadingWRVO: Low-cost health insurance plan aimed at young New YorkersWatertown Daily Times: New \u2018Essential Plan\u2019 offers free, inexpensive health insurance for low wage earners\nDive Brief:The low-cost Essential Plan, coming January 2016 to the New York healthcare marketplace, is looking to attract young people with its income-based, no-deductible strategy.\nDive Insight:Proponents note the Essential Plan is becoming cost effective compared to the rising 2016 tax penalty for lack of health insurance.\nThe plan is intended for those who have low incomes but do not qualify for Medicaid or Child Health Plus.\nAs an example, the state suggests an Essential Plan member making $20,000 per year and using \"moderate\" healthcare services can expect to pay about $730 for their 2016 premiums and out-of-pocket costs."}
