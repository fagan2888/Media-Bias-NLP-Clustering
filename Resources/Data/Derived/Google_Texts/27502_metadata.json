The point is to figure out the best way it can help.\u201d\n\nAll three panelists said finding work is the chief solution to poverty, but they suggested reforms that would cost the government money.\n\nHeather Reynolds, panelist and president of Catholic Charities Fort Worth, in Texas, said the government should create committees to study successful nonprofits and to replicate caseworker programs at a federal level.\n\nTianna Gaines-Turner, a Philadelphia wife and mother of three who lives below the poverty line, said the government should grow federal welfare programs. While the poor want to work, she said, food stamps and other programs stop or substantially decrease as soon as a family earns money or gets a savings account. If a family earns less than a living wage, losing welfare benefits may not help it out of poverty.\n\n\u201cI never wake up every day \u2026 and say that I want to be on public assistance,\u201d Gaines-Turner said. She remains on food stamps since all her children have seizure disorders and asthma.\n\nWhen Rep. Todd Rokita, R-Ind., asked Gaines-Turner how increased federal programs would help people become financially independent, she became defensive. She argued the government needs to keep the working poor on welfare rolls longer so they can become self-sufficient.\n\nRokita was not convinced: \u201cA government program cannot love. \u2026 It can\u2019t break the cycle necessarily.\u201d\n\nSome Democrats took the opportunity to attack Ryan\u2019s proposed 2015 federal budget, which would give states more control over how they use welfare while cutting Obamacare funds.\n\n\u201cAddressing these issues requires resources,\u201d said Rep. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md. \u201cOur colleagues proposed a budget that deeply cuts all those resources.\u201d\n\nRepublicans like Rep. Roger Williams, R-Texas, disagreed that the government needs more programs: \u201cPeople can help better than, in many cases, the federal government.\u201d\n\nOutside Washington, the Christian nonprofit Jobs for Life uses relationships to help people escape poverty permanently. The group based in Raleigh, N.C., uses a training program to help the poor find jobs\u2014but it doesn\u2019t believe work is the final answer.\n\n\u201cJust getting a job doesn\u2019t necessarily change the way people feel about themselves,\u201d said David Spickard, the president of Jobs for Life. \u201cThey need to know who they are, that they\u2019re valuable, that they\u2019re worthwhile. That\u2019s a heart issue.\u201d\n\nThe organization focuses on identity, character, and community so people can actually stay in their jobs once they get them. When WORLDprofiled Jobs for Life for the 2006 Hope Awards, it had only 38 locations. In 2013, about 4,700 people graduated from 275 sites in 9 countries, and 60 to 70 percent of program graduates are pursuing some kind of degree.\n\nInstead of creating more federal programs, Spickard would like the government to urge churches to step up and help those in need. He said a few local governments already help Jobs for Life sites around the United States.\n\n\u201cOftentimes, we in the faith community feel like that\u2019s the government\u2019s role,\u201d Spickard told me. \u201cI continue to encourage local church congregations in particular to see themselves as part of the solution.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "WORLD", "description": "WASHINGTON\u2014President Lyndon Johnson stood before Congress and declared a \u201cwar on poverty\u201d in January 1964.
