Woolsey Ave. in Fayetteville Courtesy photo\n\nFayetteville-based free and affordable healthcare provider Northwest Arkansas Free Health Clinic has a new name.\n\nOfficials recently announced the nonprofit clinic is now called WelcomeHealth.\n\nAccording to Monika Fischer-Massie, executive director for the organization, the new name better reflects the clinic\u2019s mission following changes brought about by the Affordable Care Act (ACA).\n\n\u201cWe felt that our previous name created a misconception in the community that we were simply a place for the uninsured to receive free care,\u201d Fischer-Massie said. \u201cTruth is, we provide medical services for that group as well as for the fully insured, including those who face challenges meeting co-pays, deductibles and other ancillary charges.\u201d\n\nFischer Massie said that while ACA has made health care more accessible for thousands of area families who were previously uncovered, the cost of monthly insurance premiums, prescriptions and co-pays means many still cannot afford basic medical services.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re here for anyone who is looking for quality health care, regardless of their insurance status or ability to pay,\u201d Fischer-Massie said. \u201cThe name \u2018WelcomeHealth\u2019 better communicates why we exist.\u201d\n\nOpened in 1986, the center provides a number of services, from primary care and prescriptions to specialties such as dental, pulmonology, women\u2019s health, mental health and more.\n\nFischer-Massie said the clinic records about 12,000 patient visits annually. The medical staff is made up of about 30 healthcare professionals, most of whom are volunteers.\n\n\u201cNone if this would be possible without the kindness of volunteers and the generosity of donors and corporate sponsors who provide financial help. Thanks to them, many of our neighbors are leading healthy\u2013and thus productive\u2013lives,\u201d she said.\n\nWelcomeHealth is located at 1100 N. Woolsey Ave. near the VA Medical Center and the UAMS Northwest campus.\n\nMore information is available at welcomehealthnwa.com.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Fayetteville-based free and affordable healthcare provider Northwest Arkansas Free Health Clinic has a new name.", "og": {"site_name": "Fayetteville Flyer", "description": "Fayetteville-based free and affordable healthcare provider Northwest Arkansas Free Health Clinic has a new name.", "title": "Northwest Arkansas Free Health Center renamed \u2018WelcomeHealth\u2019", "url": "http://www.fayettevilleflyer.com/2015/08/13/northwest-arkansas-free-health-center-renamed-welcomehealth/", "image": "http://www.fayettevilleflyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/11781788_1447487365577963_1914968497555308324_n-716x477.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "fb": {"admins": 500107432, "app_id": 642562522438118}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/fayflyer"}, "google-site-verification": "qTV397ukJaJUqtRqKzpVmC0sGwpcf6Eas9YyFxWWl3A", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbfc1\"", "article_summary": "WelcomeHealth, located at 1100 N.
