Four months after Medicaid should have started paying, she received confirmation that the insurance company would begin covering the cost.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether the family will ever get any of the money she paid back \u2014 and she\u2019s worried because her 92-year-old father needs it to live on. \u201cWhat are we going to do if he needs that money for his care later on?\u201d she said.\n\nStoll and others who help seniors through the enrollment process say such stories have become commonplace since the state put private insurance companies in charge of its Medicaid-funded long-term-care programs in July. The companies now manage the care of elderly and disabled people who need services such as home health aides, personal attendants, adult day care or placement in an assisted-living residence or nursing home.\n\nThe insurers acknowledge that some have faced delays, but they say the problem stems from backlogs in the first step of the application process \u2014 at county welfare offices, which they say are swamped by new Medicaid applications from younger low-income residents applying for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act. The welfare offices handle the initial processing of the applications before they are turned over to the insurers. That backlog is affecting anyone applying for any type of Medicaid assistance, the insurers say.\n\nIn fact, many nursing homes and assisted-living residences are also beginning to complain that they have waited months for approvals and payments, with some major chains now owed millions of dollars, said Jon Dolan, president of the Health Care Association of New Jersey.\n\nMaria Aberasturi of Bergen County\u2019s Adult Protective Services worries that the enrollment process has become so drawn out that the elderly and disabled or their harried caregivers will give up, forcing some into nursing homes early or leaving others in risky home situations.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about people who are deemed in need of a nursing-home level of care, and if the goal is to still keep them at home, then we can\u2019t be leaving them at home without services for nine months to a year,\u201d she said. \u201cSomething will end up happening. They will fall or get sicker, and then the insurance company will have to pay for them to be in a nursing home.\u201d\n\nState officials turned over Medicaid long-term care to private insurers on July 1, consolidating four Medicaid programs serving seniors and the disabled into one privatized program, called Managed Long-term Services and Supports. Five insurance carriers \u2014 Aetna, Amerigroup, Horizon, UnitedHealthcare and WellCare \u2014 have contracts to manage the program on the state\u2019s behalf.\n\nThe state Department of Human Services has been actively monitoring the revamped program, spokeswoman Nicole Brossoie said. As to whether it is taking six months or more for some people to get services in some counties, Brossoie said the department \u201cdoes not have any substantiation\u201d of those wait times.\n\n\u201cOverall, implementation went smoothly,\u201d she said.\n\nThe state said the move would save money and create more alternatives to help seniors remain in their homes and out of nursing homes, a goal the state has been talking about for several years as it prepares for the baby boom generation to retire.\n\nBut advocates say that the changes have doubled the wait times for help in Bergen and some other counties, with many complaining that their paperwork gets lost somewhere along the three-step approval process and that they can\u2019t get straight answers when they call county welfare offices and insurance companies. Hagigeorgiou, for example, said she often received conflicting information from insurance company representatives.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve probably spoken to about 10 different people the past few months, and they all said something different,\u201d she said.\n\nThe numbers of elderly or disabled residents in New Jersey receiving care in the home or in community settings has been inching upward \u2014 reaching nearly 12,899 at the end of November, a gain of 978 since the July takeover, Brossoie said, a sign that the state is making some modest gains in its goal of shifting more care out of institutional settings.\n\nWard Sanders of the New Jersey Association of Health Plans, said \u201cthere really isn\u2019t a systemic problem\u201d with delays.\n\nHe added that some companies already \u201chave a number of success stories.\u201d Horizon, which is serving nearly 7,000 Medicaid long-term-care recipients \u2014 more than half the state\u2019s total \u2014 said its representatives were successful in transitioning 38 Medicaid clients out of nursing homes and into community settings.\n\nAnd Amerigroup provided an account of a client who uses a wheelchair, identified only as \u201cFelix,\u201d who it said was on the verge of being moved into a nursing home, which would have cost the state more than $80,000 a year. A case manager helped him stay in his home by arranging for delivered meals, more aide hours and a home care plan that will instead cost $32,000 a year, according to the insurer\u2019s account.\n\nThe time it takes for a financially needy elderly or disabled resident to begin receiving services under Medicaid can vary from county to county.\n\nPassaic County officials are not reporting additional wait times. \u201cWe thought in the beginning that we would have more issues with the transition to managed care,\u201d said Sheila DeVries, a social worker for the Passaic County Agency on Senior Services, disability and Veterans Affairs. \u201cBut that hasn\u2019t been the experience. We\u2019ve not heard much negative feedback.\u201d\n\nAdvocates in Bergen County, however, continue to express frustration with the new system. Sheila Shur, supervisor of elder care for the Bergen Family Center, a non-profit that has a contract with the county to assist seniors with Medicaid applications, said her clients first encounter trouble getting appointments or returned phone calls from the county\u2019s Board of Social Services. Then once they\u2019ve completed the financial process and have been visited by a state nurse who determines eligibility, they are bounced around from representative to representative when they call the insurance companies, she said.\n\n\u201cIf [the enrollment process] is confusing to me and the other care managers, how can it possibly be understood by people not in the field?\u201d Shur said.\n\nIn addition to the approval delays, advocacy organizations and attorneys say many seniors and disabled residents are facing cuts in services, such as being provided fewer hours of home-health-aide time than they received under the old system.\n\nAppeals are increasing, said Paramus elder care attorney Robert Romano. \u201cI\u2019ve told my staff in the future we\u2019re going to be doing more appeals than applications,\u201d he said.\n\nRomano noted that families facing caregiving crises usually don\u2019t have the money to get legal help and many lack the time or savvy to challenge insurance companies. \u201cI think most people are not going to want the fight, or can\u2019t afford the fight,\u201d Romano said. \u201cSo they\u2019re going to give up, which is probably what the HMO wants them to do.\u201d\n\nOne woman in East Rutherford who cares for her 92-year-old mother at home said she went into a panic last autumn when the insurance company informed her they were cutting the hours of her mother\u2019s aide from 40 a week to 25. The reduction would have meant either quitting her full-time job or leaving her mother, who suffers from a spinal condition and is a fall risk, at home alone for hours every day.\n\nThe woman, who asked that her name not be used, appealed and \u201cbecame a real pain by calling them all the time.\u201d After a few months, she succeeded \u2014 but the insurer insisted on taking away the Medicaid-paid emergency alert device her mother had been issued, she said.\n\n\u201cIf she has a fall and we don\u2019t hear her, you can bet they\u2019re going to hear from me on that,\u201d the woman said.\n\nOfficials from Disability Rights Center, a Trenton-based non-profit, and the Community Health Law Project, an advocacy group with five offices statewide, say they have also been waging appeals of service cuts. They say many of those cuts were based on a lack of understanding by insurance companies about the long-term-care needs of the elderly and the disabled.\n\nHarold Garwin of Community Health Law Project said his agency has won in the vast majority of the 66 appeals it assisted with in 2104 \u2014 most of the time by alerting state officials that insurance representatives had misinterpreted or failed to follow guidelines.\n\nIn January, at the urging of agencies like Garwin\u2019s, the state directed insurance companies to use a new standard \u201cassessment tool\u201d when evaluating requests for personal care aides in homes.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been going right to the state with a lot of these cases, and for the most part getting favorable results,\u201d Garwin said.\n\nEmail: diskin@northjersey.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "More than seven months after insurance companies took over New Jersey\u2019s Medicaid long-term-care program, some elderly and disabled residents are experiencing lengthy delays in getting approval for in-home services.", "copyright": "North Jersey Media Group Inc.", "title": "Delays seen in approving home care for North Jersey elderly", "og": {"url": "http://www.northjersey.com/cm/2.1593/news/delays-seen-in-approving-home-care-for-north-jersey-elderly-1.1277843", "type": "article", "image": "http://www.northjersey.com:80/polopoly_fs/1.1277845!/fileImage/httpImage/homecare-022615.jpg", "site_name": "NorthJersey.com", "description": "More than seven months after insurance companies took over New Jersey\u2019s Medicaid long-term-care program, some elderly and disabled residents are experiencing lengthy delays in getting approval for in-home services."}, "author": "COLLEEN DISKIN", "robots": "noarchive,noodp,noydir", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"admins": "100002050123125,739916158,1235266096", "app_id": 130358300392751}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=446490632", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "DC.creator": "COLLEEN DISKIN", "msvalidate.01": "697A26605161B513EFE2AD6E581F4AA8", "google-site-verification": "swyvR_LXSGMOxOz1638gujs38OoVP3sZwJgdjySjnXM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=2.0, user-scalable=yes", "DC.title": "Delays seen in approving home care for North Jersey elderly"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb331\"", "article_summary": "They say many of those cuts were based on a lack of understanding by insurance companies about the long-term-care needs of the elderly and the disabled.\nMore than seven months after insurance companies took over New Jersey\u2019s Medicaid long-term-care program, some elderly and disabled residents are experiencing lengthy delays in getting approval for in-home services.\nRomano noted that families facing caregiving crises usually don\u2019t have the money to get legal help and many lack the time or savvy to challenge insurance companies.\nThe time it takes for a financially needy elderly or disabled resident to begin receiving services under Medicaid can vary from county to county.\nFour months after Medicaid should have started paying, she received confirmation that the insurance company would begin covering the cost."}
