KRASNAYA POLYANA, Russia —Marit Bjoergen gave Norway a dominant victory in the women’s cross-country team sprint on Wednesday for her fifth career Olympic gold medal.

Bjoergen opened up a sizeable gap for Norway on her first of three laps in the final and only extended the lead after that. Teammate Ingvild Flugstad Oestberg helped maintain the Norwegian lead on her three laps and earned her first gold to go with a silver from the individual sprint.

Norway won by 9.09 seconds ahead of Finland, which took silver. Sweden took bronze after Stina Nilsson won a sprint against Germany’s Denise Herrmann.

Aino-Kaisa Saarinen and Kerttu Niskanen competed for Finland. Ida Ingemarsdotter was the other skier for Sweden.
