Johnson said the EPA is also in the process of extending the public comment period until September 2.\n\nThe rule spurred outrage among conservative groups and lawmakers, who decried the measure as an unwarranted government intrusion into the lives of ordinary individuals.\n\n\n\nCongressional Republicans took particular exception to the notion that the agency could garnish a worker\u2019s wages without a court order - and because the agency imposed the measure through a direct, final rule, rather than draft regulations.\n\nAn amendment attached to spending legislation advanced this week by the House Appropriations Committee would prohibit the EPA from implementing the rule.\n\n\n\nThe amendment was included over the objections of Democrats, who said the rule had been taken out of context to support a GOP narrative that the agency has run wild with its regulatory power.\n\n\n\nRep.
