High tea was sipped late in the afternoon, while swells crowded in the restaurant\u2019s dining room, wrapped in furs, diamonds, and pearls. Upstairs, a fireplace warmed the majestic suites, as butlers tended to the blaze and turned down the plush linens just before bedtime. For out-of-town medical experts, these amenities were part of the mystique of staying at the Ritz while doing business at nearby Harvard, MIT, or the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nDuring a visit to see their Boston-based publisher, Masters and Johnson enjoyed this grand hotel and were delighted when it became their book\u2019s launching pad with the press. In facing skeptics before, they\u2019d tried a similar swank approach without much luck. They had chartered a spacious hotel suite to present their findings in Chicago when banned from a national obstetricians and gynecologists convention there. They also served libations for the \u201cWash U\u201d medical faculty when showing their filmed lab results. Both proved disasters. Still, these past experiences prepared them well for the challenge they were about to endure. They didn\u2019t want to be panned in Boston.\n\nIn April 1966, Masters and Johnson presided over an almost quaint series of press conferences at the Ritz that seemed more like informal seminars than a ritualized media grilling in front of a microphone. Sitting in comfortable chairs beside a long, draped window, they discussed their findings during two-hour sessions, which turned out both lively and convincing. They deliberately reserved two separate bedrooms for themselves at the hotel to avoid gossip.\n\nDuring these sessions, skeptics were impressed with Masters\u2019s crisp authority and technical virtuosity. Johnson, with her trained vocals, further elucidated in plain English. Their publisher invited several influential journalists, including John Corry of the New York Times, Albert Rosenfeld of Life magazine, Arthur Snider of the respected Chicago Daily News, and Earl Ubell of the New York Herald Tribune\u2014a core group that would influence the rest of the media coverage. While some findings had been leaked already, these lengthy, relaxed discussions at the Ritz became Masters and Johnson\u2019s first formal encounter with the press. The outcome couldn\u2019t have been better. \u201cDr. Masters\u2019 and Mrs. Johnson\u2019s face-to-face confrontation with the nation\u2019s science writers yielded an extraordinarily favorable reaction to their book,\u201d concluded Harper\u2019s magazine in its own laudatory profile, \u201cThe Sex Crusaders from Missouri.\u201d\n\nThese once-obscure researchers were now described in Nietzschean superhero terms, as \u201cendowed with exceptional sensibility, nerve and persistence\u201d in educating a nation. Reflecting his paper\u2019s unexcitable manner, Corry\u2019s dispatch in the Times stressed numbers that were almost unimaginable. During the eleven-year study, Corry noted, some ten thousand orgasms were tracked through \u201cdirect observation\u201d of hundreds of men and women \u201cengaged in coitus and masturbation.\u201d In mentioning the uncounted prostitutes from Masters\u2019s preliminary research before Johnson arrived on the scene, Corry advised readers that \u201ca more accurate and conservative estimate\u201d might be between twelve thousand and fifteen thousand orgasms, figures that boggled the mind. Corry, like the other science writers, underlined that Masters and Johnson were the purest of white-coated scientists, a sober-minded, male-female team that had \u201ctaken pains to purge the book of anything that might be considered salacious.\u201d But not everyone agreed.\n\nCritic Albert Goldman, like Farber and others, pointed obsessively to the \u201cplastic dildo\u201d and the study\u2019s coldhearted description of human intimacy. In his review of their book, Goldman complained it should have been called \u201cSexual Body Mechanics,\u201d as even the elderly seemed hypersexed. \u201cOne wishes that we could return to the wisdom of an earlier time that accepted physical decline and sought compensation in pursuits that transcend the physical,\u201d Goldman lamented. \u201cPerhaps a genuinely prophetic imagination is declaring itself in the book\u2019s most indelible image, that of a woman mating with herself by means of a machine.\u201d\n\nOf the seven hundred reviews and notices about Human Sexual Response, the biggest stamp of approval came from the Journal of the American Medical Association, the kind of professional publication that once shunned their work. \u201cWhy was this study so long in coming?\u201d asked the JAMA editorial. \u201cIt is no more reasonable to teach students the anatomy of the reproductive organs and ignore the way these organs function during their ordered activities than it would be to study the anatomy of the stomach but disdain any knowledge of [how it works.]\u201d\n\nIn the whiz-bang scientific era of the 1960s, admirers such as psychiatrist George Krupp suggested Masters and Johnson\u2019s findings illuminated the world of sex that seemed, in retrospect, like the dark side of the moon before NASA documented its deep curves and crevices. \u201cIf we are inclined to regard sexual union as something so sacrosanct that it should not be open to investigation, we should remember that a similar view was taken regarding the stars in Galileo\u2019s day,\u201d insisted another reviewer.\n\nAlthough Alfred Kinsey had provided the broad outlines of American sexual practices and others, such as Dr. Mary Calderone, had pushed for sex education in the classroom, Masters and Johnson produced hard-science answers for specific questions that went unasked by millions. As sociologist John Gagnon observed, \u201cEverybody seems to be in favor of sex education, but they\u2019re against doing the research that would give us the knowledge to educate people with.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"Human Sexual Response\" transformed the public discourse about sex in America, opening a new era of candidness", "title": "The \u201960s were \u201cthe decade of orgasmic preoccupation\u201d: Even suburban housewives were emboldened by Masters and Johnson\u2019s \u201cHuman Sexual Response\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "\"Human Sexual Response\" transformed the public discourse about sex in America, opening a new era of candidness", "title": "The \u201960s were \u201cthe decade of orgasmic preoccupation\u201d: Even suburban housewives were emboldened by Masters and Johnson\u2019s \u201cHuman Sexual Response\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/07/12/the_60s_were_the_decade_of_orgasmic_preoccupation_even_pent_up_suburban_housewives_were_emboldened_by_masters_and_johnsons_human_sexual_response/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/masters_of_sex2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"Human Sexual Response\" transformed the public discourse about sex in America, opening a new era of candidness", "title": "The \u201960s were \u201cthe decade of orgasmic preoccupation\u201d: Even suburban housewives were emboldened by Masters and Johnson\u2019s \u201cHuman Sexual Response\u201d", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/masters_of_sex2.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Thomas Maier", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Books, Editor's Picks, Masters of Sex, Showtime, Virginia Johnson, William Masters", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1e66\"", "article_summary": "While some findings had been leaked already, these lengthy, relaxed discussions at the Ritz became Masters and Johnson\u2019s first formal encounter with the press.\nDuring a visit to see their Boston-based publisher, Masters and Johnson enjoyed this grand hotel and were delighted when it became their book\u2019s launching pad with the press.\nCritic Albert Goldman, like Farber and others, pointed obsessively to the \u201cplastic dildo\u201d and the study\u2019s coldhearted description of human intimacy.\nThey had chartered a spacious hotel suite to present their findings in Chicago when banned from a national obstetricians and gynecologists convention there.\nIn his review of their book, Goldman complained it should have been called \u201cSexual Body Mechanics,\u201d as even the elderly seemed hypersexed."}
