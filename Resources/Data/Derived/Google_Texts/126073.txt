On Nov. 17, researchers from the Monterey Bay Aquarian Research Institute captured what is thought to be the first video of the strangest sea creature I have ever seen: a rare anglerfish known as the Black Seadevil. The fish, which is only found at extreme depths, was spotted in the Monterey Canyon, at about 1,900 feet deep.

According to CNN, the fish was located by “Doc Ricketts,” a remotely controlled robotic vehicle used to investigate the extreme depths of the ocean. Doc Ricketts was conducting a “midwater transect” when the anglerfish was spotted.
