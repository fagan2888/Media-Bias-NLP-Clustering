His sergeant, with icy brutality, strangles a fellow soldier in front of amused Oriental officers. Sinatra feels he\u2019s going crazy until he finds another platoon member also having these sleep terrors. Sinatra realizes they\u2019ve all been the subject of some insidious brainwashing in a commie plot to have the now Medal of Honor-decorated sergeant (Laurence Harvey) become an unwitting assassin of a presidential candidate.\n\nFilm buffs know this is a scene from the brilliant, paranoid 1962 John Frankenheimer film \u201cThe Manchurian Candidate.\u201d Released at the time of the Cuban Missile Crisis, less than a year before President Kennedy was assassinated, the successful film play-acted a recurrent script of US political culture: A yellow peril, in one variant or another, was out to get Americans and America.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow could Americans believe Kennedy\u2019s successor, Lyndon Johnson, about the Gulf of Tonkin \u201cincident\u201d? This was before Watergate; the word of the president was still sacrosanct. But just as important, American culture was saturated with Orientalphobia, a variant of what historian Richard Hofstader, in a famous 1964 essay providing a deep context for McCarthyism, called the \u201cparanoid style of American politics.\u201d The evil \u201cyellow genius\u201d had long been a fixture of Anglo-American commercial culture. The fabulous Boris Karloff in \u201cThe Mask of Fu Manchu\u201d (1932), with the delightful Myrna Loy as the evil one\u2019s sexually depraved daughter, still played as television reruns. Yellow-face actors with hokey accents and odd demeanors regularly populated print and electronic media, as they do today.\n\nSuch depictions were not limited to fictional characters. In 1902, Samuel Gompers, the British-born Jewish immigrant who founded the American Federation of Labor, argued for the permanent extension of the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act with the pamphlet \u201cSome Reasons for Chinese Exclusion. Meat vs. Rice. American Manhood against Asiatic Coolieism. Which Shall Survive?\u201d And the eugenics-driven National Origins Act of 1924 still constituted US immigration law.\n\nIn short, the larger racial culture predisposed voters to believe a yellow-peril war script. And the same culture had true believers imagining that the virile Marines would quickly prevail over short, heathen \u201cgooks.\u201d In hindsight, we know none of this was true at that time. We should also know that this paranoid style has not served our nation well in the half century since (WMDs, anyone?). Putting the Gulf of Tonkin \u201cincident\u201d into this larger historical arc helps us understand why, when stereotypes pervade the public imagination, a democratic society can be vulnerable to systemic misinformation.", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "3.3.470921853", "eomportal-id": 727299, "description": "John Frankenheimer\u2019s 192 film \u201cThe Manchurian Candidate\u201d play-acted a recurrent script of US political culture: A yellow peril, in one variant or another, was out to get Americans and America.
