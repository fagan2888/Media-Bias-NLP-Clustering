The deal includes $61 million in guaranteed money, a person with knowledge of the contract said, speaking on condition of anonymity because terms weren\u2019t disclosed.\n\nThe sides had made it a top priority to get a deal done before the start of training camp next month.\n\n\u201cThey were able to get it done six weeks earlier than what I think everyone thought,\u201d Kaepernick said. \u201cI\u2019m very excited to have it done at this point and we don\u2019t have to worry about talks or anything like that moving forward.\u201d\n\nKaepernick, whose quick ascent to the ranks of the NFL\u2019s elite under center has earned him rock star status, had been due to make less than $1 million this season.\n\nNow, the 26-year-old Kaepernick instantly becomes one of the league\u2019s richest stars.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m always striving to be in that group. An elite group in the NFL. Not necessarily pay, but as far as a player. Whatever comes along with that comes along with it,\u201d Kaepernick said. \u201cI\u2019m very grateful for it. \u2026 I don\u2019t think my motivation is money-driven.\u201d\n\nSince taking over the starting job from Alex Smith two years ago, Kaepernick led the 49ers to their first Super Bowl in 18 years after the 2012 season \u2014 losing by three points to Baltimore \u2014 and then to the NFC championship game last season, a three-point defeat to the rival and eventual Super Bowl champion Seattle Seahawks.\n\nKaepernick even offered a shoutout to 2005 No. 1 overall draft pick Smith, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t think I would be able to be at this point so quickly if he hadn\u2019t been such a great mentor to me and helped me along with things.\u201d\n\nKaepernick\u2019s next mission:\n\n\u201cTrying to win as many Super Bowls as I can,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that\u2019s your goal as a player to try to win a Super Bowl every year that you\u2019re playing.\u201d\n\nA second-round draft pick out of Nevada in 2011, Kaepernick has thrived under former NFL quarterback Jim Harbaugh \u2014 and the coach has said how much he wants the mobile, strong-armed QB around for the long haul. Accomplishing an extension before the season is a big deal as the team begins its first year in $1.2 billion Levi\u2019s Stadium at team headquarters.\n\n\u201cI really expect a real breakout year for Colin. Athletically, he looks bionic,\u201d Harbaugh said during the organized team activity last week. \u201cIf you all remember \u2018The Six Million Dollar Man,\u2019 that\u2019s what it looks like to me. He\u2019s very gifted and he always has been. He has the look and feel of a guy who\u2019s really going to break out, even more so than he already has. I\u2019m really excited about everything about his game right now.\u201d\n\nGreetings and kind words came via Twitter posts from teammates.\n\n\u201cCongrats to my boy @kaepernick7 on the extension! (hashtag)deserving (hashtag)hardestworkingdudeiknow,\u201d wrote fullback Bruce Miller.\n\nIn a sensational playoff debut in January 2013 against Green Bay, Kap \u2014 as they call him \u2014 used his speedy legs to run for a quarterback playoff-record 181 yards and a pair of touchdowns. Then, in a season-opening win against the Packers last September, the strong-armed San Francisco QB threw for a career-best 412 yards and three scores.\n\n\u201cColin\u2019s hard work and dedication have played an integral role in the recent success of the 49ers organization,\u201d 49ers general manager Trent Baalke said in a statement. \u201cHis work ethic, leadership and on-field production have positively influenced our team, and we look forward to his continued growth in all areas. Our organization always looks to reward our players for their contributions and commitment to the team.\u201d\n\nHarbaugh remained optimistic of getting a new deal done, while Kaepernick said his only focus was on football and he was leaving it to his agents to do the rest. The quarterback had said he sought a \u201cfair\u201d deal.\n\nHe is regularly the first to arrive at work each morning and the last one off the field.\n\nKaepernick has completed 382 of 639 passes for 5,046 yards and 31 touchdowns. He also has started all six postseason games in which he has appeared, earning four wins and passing for 1,374 yards and seven touchdowns.\n\nKaepernick said last week he hopes a Miami investigation from April that names him will soon be over. He said that matter didn\u2019t affect his thoughts about whether it would affect the extension.\n\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019t something I was worried about,\u201d Kaepernick said. \u201cI let my agents handle all the talking.\u201d\n\nLast month, Miami Police released two calls to a 911 dispatcher saying a woman identifying herself as Jesus was lying naked in a bed and refusing to leave. The callers said the woman wanted to spend time with a third man who wasn\u2019t there.\n\nPolice say the players also involved in the case are 49ers wide receiver Quinton Patton and Seahawks receiver Ricardo Lockette. None of them has been charged with any wrongdoing.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just really thrilled for the Kaepernick family. They\u2019re amazing people,\u201d agent Scott Smith said after Kaepernick\u2019s news conference. \u201cWe\u2019re just so happy for them. We\u2019re really grateful of all the hard work the 49ers put into it.\u201d\n\nSo, about his timely sock selection?\n\n\u201cTo be honest, one of my friends gave them to me, gave me a box of socks,\u201d he said. \u201cNo idea what brand or what company, but they were in my drawer.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colin Kaepernick lands new six-year deal to stay with 49ers", "title": "Colin Kaepernick lands new six-year deal to stay with 49ers", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/06/04/colin-kaepernick-lands-new-six-year-deal-to-stay-with-49ers/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140604__colin-kaepernickp1.jpg", "height": 496}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140604__colin-kaepernickp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-04T14:44:02+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T05:47:16+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "We\u2019re really grateful of all the hard work the 49ers put into it.\u201dSo, about his timely sock selection?\n\u201cThey were able to get it done six weeks earlier than what I think everyone thought,\u201d Kaepernick said.\n\u201cColin\u2019s hard work and dedication have played an integral role in the recent success of the 49ers organization,\u201d 49ers general manager Trent Baalke said in a statement.\nThe sides had made it a top priority to get a deal done before the start of training camp next month.\nPolice say the players also involved in the case are 49ers wide receiver Quinton Patton and Seahawks receiver Ricardo Lockette."}
