Deborah Hersman, National Safety Council CEO, provides insight to a new report showing cell phones are involved in an estimated 27 percent of all car crashes.

With people increasingly plugged in because of the ubiquity of mobile devices, drivers are also more distracted than ever, according to an advocacy group, and the result is a bigger share of motor accidents.

Recently, the National Safety Council (NSC) released data showing that 27 percent of car crashes—or 1,535,490 in 2013—were caused by cell phone use.

The boom in cell phone use is adding to the already costly problem of road injuries and deaths.



In an interview with CNBC this week, the CEO of the NSC, Deborah Hersman, said the percentage of cell phone related crashes isn't surprising, since cell phone use behind the wheel happens frequently. The challenge is to find a solution, she said.

"People are not surprised because they see so many people doing it," Hersman said. "What they need to do is talk about the things that business leaders are doing. They are leading the way."
