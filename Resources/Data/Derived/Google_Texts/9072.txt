HOUSTON (ChurchMilitant.com) - Chris Dunn, the patient who begged for his life after Houston Methodist Hospital decided he wasn't worth trying to save, died this morning of natural causes at 6:30 a.m.

Trey Trainor, the attorney representing Chris and his mother against the hospital that had wanted to pull Chris off life-sustaining treatment, told ChurchMilitant.com that the hospital never reached a diagnosis on Chris' condition, even though its ethics comittee did determine that life-sustaining treatment was futile. He also said an autopsy is being performed to identify the exact cause of Chris' death.

Throughout the entire legal ordeal, Chris' mother Evelyn did not give up on her son and never left his bedside. She said today in a statement:

Chris' family and I are grateful for all of the prayers, kind notes of encouragement, and support we have received from around the world. We would like to express our deepest gratitude to the nurses who have cared for Chris and for Methodist Hospital for continuing life-sustaining treatment of Chris until his natural death. Chris' health battle has now ended, but I intend to continue the fight against this horrible law. No family should have to fight for the right to life of their loved one.

Chris was 46 years old.
