Leroy Burnell/Staff\n\nWhen I got around to looking at the registration form for the 38th Cooper River Bridge Run and Walk last January, one part of it made me gulp.\n\nOn Jan. 15, more than two months before Saturday\u2019s race, the price went from $50 up to $55. By comparison, in 2014, the price went from $40 to $45 on February 15.\n\nRace Director Julian Smith defended the price increase, saying it was the result of increased costs for buses and security \u2014 understandable considering the transportation problems that delayed the 2012 race and security concerns after the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013. Smith said participants get a lot for their entry fee, and that it was in line with similar 10K events.\n\nHe used Colorado\u2019s Bolder Boulder 10K as an example. It has different prices and discounts depending on what kind of shirt you want and whether you\u2019re young, old or in the military. For a short sleeve shirt, similar to the Bridge Run\u2019s, the fee is $50 for adults and $35 for kids, seniors and military personnel two months before the race. Two weeks before the race, it goes up to $60 for adults and $45 for kids, seniors and military.\n\nThe largest 10K in the country, Atlanta\u2019s Peachtree Road Race, is simple and inexpensive by comparison: $35 for Atlanta Track Club members and $38 for non-members. And New Orleans\u2019 Crescent City 10K, which is usually held the same weekend as the Bridge Run, is $35 two months before the race.\n\nRegistrations way down\n\nThe increased fees may have played a role in the decrease of registered participants. Saturday\u2019s preliminary registration count was 32,952, which is 5,520 less than in 2014 and the lowest since the event was moved to the Arthur Ravenel Jr. Bridge in 2006. The number of finishers \u2014 the preliminary count was 27,318 \u2014 marked the first time since 2008 that the Bridge Run didn\u2019t break the 30,000 mark.\n\nEarly speculation by some Bridge Run staff and board members was that numbers were down because the race was held a week earlier to avoid being run on Easter weekend.\n\nBut in 2012, the last time the Bridge Run was held a week early because of Easter, it had record-breaking numbers. That year 43,635 registered and 36,756 finished the race, despite a delay of nearly an hour because of the crowd. Registration was capped at 38,500 for regularly priced entries as a result of that race. Other reasons cited for the lower numbers included a decrease in registration \u201cemail blasts\u201d sent out this year, a colder than average winter, and hotels charging higher rates.\n\nIs it too \u2018pricey?\u2019\n\nThe consensus of runners interviewed outside of the Charleston Running Club tent after the race was that an early registration fee of $55 was too expensive.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s way too much for a 10K,\u201d said Club President Paul MacDonald, who did not run the race because he needed to help staff the tent. \u201cI make a good living, but I\u2019m still careful about how I spend my money and I wouldn\u2019t pay $55 for a 10K.\u201d\n\nAfter Thursday\u2019s Yogapop event (which cost $25 in advance and $32 at the door), participant Keli Tolley said she was not running the Bridge Run this year because the fee was too much.\n\nThe event is even pricier for families with children who want to run. For a mother, father and two kids the total price tag was $220.\n\nOther suggestions from runners: Give a discount to people who live in the greater Charleston area and charge a lower fee for walkers.\n\nAt Friday\u2019s press lunch, Bridge Run founder Marcus Newberry and Charleston Mayor Joe Riley recalled the Bridge Run\u2019s original intent in 1978 was to encourage local residents to adopt healthier lifestyles. With all the corporate sponsorships and attention to the bells and whistles, it would be a shame if the Bridge Run is pricing some people out of an event.\n\nMaybe a more affordable event would be possible without entertainers, skydivers and an array of invitation-only parties.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Looking for reasons why Bridge Run numbers took big dip, Sports, \r\nSportsCooper River Bridge Run, \r\nFP LatestNews, \r\nFeatures columnists, \r\nFeatures columnists, Bridge Run,Cooper River Bridge Run,Julian Smith,Running,tourism", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "When I got around to looking at the registration form for the 38th Cooper River Bridge Run and Walk last January, one part of it made me gulp.", "title": "Looking for reasons why Bridge Run numbers took big dip", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20150328/150329289/looking-for-reasons-why-bridge-run-numbers-took-big-dip", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150328/PC20/150329289/AR/0/AR-150329289.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150328/PC20/150329289/AR/0/AR-150329289.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "When I got around to looking at the registration form for the 38th Cooper River Bridge Run and Walk last January, one part of it made me gulp.", "title": "Looking for reasons why Bridge Run numbers took big dip", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@hsprepzone", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150328/PC20/150329289/AR/0/AR-150329289.jpg?201503281633", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 150329289}}, "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "keywords": "Looking for reasons why Bridge Run numbers took big dip , Sports, \r\nSportsCooper River Bridge Run, \r\nFP LatestNews, \r\nFeatures columnists, \r\nFeatures columnists, Bridge Run,Cooper River Bridge Run,Julian Smith,Running,tourism", "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-28T16:32:01Z", "modified_time": "2015-03-28T16:33:00Z", "author": "David Quick"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "When I got around to looking at the registration form for the 38th Cooper River Bridge Run and Walk last January, one part of it made me gulp."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd13f3\"", "article_summary": "But in 2012, the last time the Bridge Run was held a week early because of Easter, it had record-breaking numbers.\nRunners and walkers make their way across the bridge Saturday during the 2015 Cooper River Bridge Run.\nThe number of finishers \u2014 the preliminary count was 27,318 \u2014 marked the first time since 2008 that the Bridge Run didn\u2019t break the 30,000 mark.\nAt Friday\u2019s press lunch, Bridge Run founder Marcus Newberry and Charleston Mayor Joe Riley recalled the Bridge Run\u2019s original intent in 1978 was to encourage local residents to adopt healthier lifestyles.\nEarly speculation by some Bridge Run staff and board members was that numbers were down because the race was held a week earlier to avoid being run on Easter weekend."}
