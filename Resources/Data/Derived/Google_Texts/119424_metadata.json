This is not the case for long-term inflation expectations, which are more stable and typically do not respond to large changes in goods or services prices.\"\n\nAnd so by looking at the relative lack of change in the 12-month outlook for inflation, the point LaVorgna is making is that though the price of gas declined, consumers didn't adjust their outlooks.\n\nThis, in part, might explain why consumers saved, rather than spent, their gas savings.\n\nThe chart below shows how retail gas prices plunged, while one-year forward inflation expectations were little changed.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#185f7c", "sailthru.author": "Akin Oyedele", "application-name": "Business Insider", "twitter": {"description": "Most people expect gas prices to go up soon.", "creator": "AkinOyedele", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/americans-see-low-gas-prices-as-temporary-2015-4", "image": "http://static2.businessinsider.com/image/54919ed8eab8ea5b2894f599-506-253/heres-the-best-explanation-for-why-households-arent-spending-their-gas-savings.jpg", "title": "Here's the best explanation for why households aren't spending their gas savings", "site": "themoneygame", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.verticals": "moneygame,clusterstock", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "sailthru.tags": "Gas Prices, Deutsche Bank, Joe LaVorgna, Akin Oyedele", "description": "Most people expect gas prices to go up soon.", "author": "Akin Oyedele", "sailthru.date": "2015-04-13", "sailthru.title": "Here's the best explanation for why households aren't spending their gas savings", "theme-color": "#185f7c", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://static4.businessinsider.com/image/5484eee2eab8ea836db17e2b-50-50/heres-the-best-explanation-for-why-households-arent-spending-their-gas-savings.jpg", "news_keywords": "Gas Prices, Deutsche Bank, Joe LaVorgna, Akin Oyedele", "tbi-image": "http://static5.businessinsider.com/image/5484eee2eab8ea836db17e2b/heres-the-best-explanation-for-why-households-arent-spending-their-gas-savings.jpg", "fb": {"app_id": 155043519637}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/assets/images/us/favicons/mstile-144x144.png?v=BI-US-2016-03-31", "date": "2015-04-13", "article": {"publisher": "businessinsider", "author": "http://www.businessinsider.com/author/akin-oyedele"}, "sailthru.description": "Most people expect gas prices to go up soon.", "viewport": "width=1024", "og": {"site_name": "Business Insider", "description": "Most people expect gas prices to go up soon.", "title": "Here's the best explanation for why households aren't spending their gas savings", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/americans-see-low-gas-prices-as-temporary-2015-4", "image": "http://static6.businessinsider.com/image/54919ed8eab8ea5b2894f599-1190-625/heres-the-best-explanation-for-why-households-arent-spending-their-gas-savings.jpg", "type": "article"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Business Insider", "title": "Here's the best explanation for why households aren't spending their gas savings", "sailthru.image.full": "http://static5.businessinsider.com/image/5484eee2eab8ea836db17e2b/heres-the-best-explanation-for-why-households-arent-spending-their-gas-savings.jpg", "tbi-vertical": "moneygame"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe225a\"", "article_summary": "The chart below shows how retail gas prices plunged, while one-year forward inflation expectations were little changed.\nHowever, the most plausible reason is that households just don\u2019t think gas prices will stay low for much longer.\nHere\u2019s LaVorgna:\"We can see this by looking at short-term inflation expectations, which tend to be heavily influenced by the change in gasoline prices.\nThis is not the case for long-term inflation expectations, which are more stable and typically do not respond to large changes in goods or services prices.\"\nHouseholds are not spending the tax break that's come in the form of gas savings."}
