Gruber is a gifted academic \u2013 and a decidedly less gifted politician \u2013 who attributed the passage of the Affordable Care Act to the \u201cstupidity\u201d of American voters and a lack of transparency in how the bill was pitched and passed.\n\nGruber has not done anything wrong. He is like a doctor who tells you that you\u2019re fat and lazy. It may be a poor choice of words, but if you are sedentary and 45 pounds overweight, he\u2019s basically correct. And the fact that you are in such bad shape is your fault, not his.\n\nSo it is with the Affordable Care Act. Gruber offered his informed input as the Affordable Care Act was being formulated, as he did with former Gov. Mitt Romney\u2019s state-based reform in Massachusetts. (Yes, Obamacare is fundamentally the same as Romneycare, despite Romney\u2019s tortured protestations to the contrary during the 2012 Republican primaries.) In a democratic system, advisers are just that \u2013 advisers. President Barack Obama and the Democrats in Congress passed the Affordable Care Act, with the support of a high proportion of the electorate and without any meaningful participation from Republicans who might have made the law better. That\u2019s where culpability lies. Nowhere else.\n\nStill, there are many lessons to be learned from Gruber\u2019s 15 minutes of infamy.\n\n\n\n[READ: Jonathan Gruber Stirs Up the Obamacare Debate Again]\n\nFirst, Gruber should not have called Americans stupid. We\u2019re not. But we are unengaged, lazy and easily swayed by superficial policy discussions. The voter turnout for the midterm elections was 36 percent, a 72-year low. What more do you need to know? Isn\u2019t that sufficient evidence to prove that most Americans cannot muster the minimal energy necessary to engage in important national decisions? Gruber\u2019s choice of adjectives was poor, but I appreciate his point. By and large, we get the government we deserve. Right now, Congress is a pretty good fit for our uninformed electorate.\n\nHowever, there is a difference between uninformed and stupid. If I were unlucky enough to be convicted of a serious crime, I would have every confidence in the wisdom of a jury of my peers. I believe that a diverse and random sample of Americans, when presented with all relevant evidence, has a deep pool of good judgment and common sense. (My one experience serving on a jury was shockingly uplifting.)\n\nThat said, I would not want to be tried before a jury of my peers whose only knowledge of my case was gleaned from cable news programs and gossip at the gym. Sadly, that is the most apt description of our current policy environment. Most voters have only the most superficial knowledge of what they need to know about a complex topic like health care. Politicians routinely exploit this knowledge gap \u2013 or even contribute to it by promising things that cannot possibly be delivered.\n\nSecond, the Democratic health care plan was born of deception \u2013 but we didn\u2019t need Gruber to tell us that. The intellectual dishonesty began during the Democratic presidential primary, when Obama promised something that is not possible: affordable care for everyone, without any exclusion for preexisting conditions and with no insurance mandate. Think about it: If everyone gets charged the same rate for insurance regardless of their health status, the only sensible time to buy insurance would be after becoming sick or injured. (\u201cExcuse me, could you turn off the siren for a moment, I need to call Aetna before the ambulance gets to the emergency room.\u201d) The insurance industry would collapse if only sick people bought insurance.\n\n\n\n[SEE: Political Cartoons on Obamacare]\n\nAs I\u2019ve written before, politicians get away with this nonsense because we like to hear it. We are pathologically eager to hear that we can lose weight by eating ice cream and chronically disappointed when it just leads to more flab. (\u201cWhat? Tax cuts increase the deficit? That\u2019s not what George W. Bush said!\u201d)\n\nThird, the Republicans are supposedly aghast that the Democrats exploited voters\u2019 superficial knowledge of health care policy to get the Affordable Care Act passed. Not since Captain Renault was \u201cshocked, shocked!\u201d that gambling was going at Rick\u2019s Cafe in \"Casablanca\" has there been so much faux surprise and indignation.\n\nNot only do the Republicans do the same thing, they are better at it. If you would like to be impressed and appalled at the same time, watch the \"Frontline\" special \u201cThe Persuaders\u201d in which Republican pollster Frank Luntz explains how he reframed the estate tax as the \u201cdeath tax\u201d and global warming as \u201cclimate change,\u201d thereby changing voters\u2019 perceptions of both issues. (Luntz appears in chapter five, which can be watched online here.) Yes, language matters \u2013 like the difference between a \u201cmandate\u201d and a \u201ctax.\u201d Welcome to politics.\n\nFourth, the Republicans still have no alternative health care plan. They would do well to find a Gruber of their own (and perhaps provide him or her with some media training). As I\u2019ve written before, health care is a trap waiting to happen for the Republicans, particularly for the 2016 presidential hopefuls. They will fall all over themselves promising to repeal Obamacare; the point of distinction will be what each candidate vows to do next.\n\n\n\n[SEE: Political Cartoons on the Republican Party]", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion]", "title": "Jonathan Gruber Has a Point About Americans and Obamacare", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "No, Americans aren't stupid, but they are dangerously tuned out from important national decisions.", "title": "Jonathan Gruber's Got a Point", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/charles-wheelan/2014/12/01/jonathan-gruber-has-a-point-about-americans-and-obamacare", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/20/c8/11ed9c56427fa33bc4a459c10ff5/141118-jgruber-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@USNews", "description": "No, Americans aren't stupid, but they are dangerously tuned out from important national decisions.", "card": "summary", "title": "Jonathan Gruber Has a Point About Americans and Obamacare"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "opinion", "date_published": "Dec. 1, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Charles Wheelan,politics,health care,Affordable Care Act,health care reform,picks,Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion]", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "No, Americans aren't stupid, but they are dangerously tuned out from important national decisions."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1d93\"", "article_summary": "[READ: Jonathan Gruber Stirs Up the Obamacare Debate Again]First, Gruber should not have called Americans stupid.\nGruber offered his informed input as the Affordable Care Act was being formulated, as he did with former Gov.\nJonathan Gruber is the Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist and health care expert who has found himself in the crosshairs of the broader Obamacare debate.\nSecond, the Democratic health care plan was born of deception \u2013 but we didn\u2019t need Gruber to tell us that.\nSo it is with the Affordable Care Act."}
