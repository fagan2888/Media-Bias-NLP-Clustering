She told lawmakers rates would increase in 2015 but grow more slowly than in the past\u2026\n\nAreas of the country with older, sicker or smaller populations are likely to be hit hardest, while others might not see substantial increases at all.\n\nDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s only the old, sick rednecks who\u2019ll suffer. That means Obama didn\u2019t lie his ass off after all. Whew!\n\nJust make sure you stop calling it the \u201cAffordable Care Act,\u201d Dems. That no longer polls well. And \u201cObamacare\u201d went right out the window with his poll numbers. Stick with \u201cACA.\u201d\n\nAll the chirpy TV ads and Twitter hashtags in the world can\u2019t polish the turd that is Obamacare. This needless debacle is going to hurt a lot of people, and the idiots who are subjecting us to it have no plan except to keep telling us outrageous lies.\n\nAs November approaches, millions of Americans are itching to vote for the repeal of Obamacare. And Democrats are panicking. As well they should. This is all on them.\n\nP.S. Don\u2019t worry, NASA isn\u2019t in charge of sending things into space anymore. Now it\u2019s focused on telling us that society is going to collapse unless we stop fueling the economy that, um, pays for NASA.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Jim Treacher", "description": "As Obama continues to pitch his signature presidential \"achievement\" to the dwindling number of Americans dumb enough to believe a word he says -- Zach", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "As Obama continues to pitch his signature presidential \"achievement\" to the dwindling number of Americans dumb enough to believe a word he says -- Zach Galifianakis fans, Ryan Seacrest listeners, etc.", "title": "Obamacare must be run by NASA, because premiums are going to skyrocket", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/03/19/obamacare-must-be-run-by-nasa-because-premiums-are-going-to-skyrocket/", "image": {"width": 438, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Healthcare.gov_-e1395237919172.jpg", "height": 190}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "As Obama continues to pitch his signature presidential \"achievement\" to the dwindling number of Americans dumb enough to believe a word he says --...", "title": "Obamacare must be run by NASA, because premiums are going to skyrocket Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/03/19/obamacare-must-be-run-by-nasa-because-premiums-are-going-to-skyrocket/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Healthcare.gov_-e1395237919172.jpg"}, "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-03-19 10:13:48", "sailthru.title": "Obamacare must be run by NASA, because premiums are going to skyrocket", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "sailthru.tags": "treacher,jim-treacher", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "keywords": "treacher", "sailthru.description": "As Obama continues to pitch his signature presidential \"achievement\" to the dwindling number of Americans dumb enough to believe a word he says -- Zach Galifianakis fans, Ryan Seacrest listeners, etc.", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Healthcare.gov_-e1395237919172.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb54d\"", "article_summary": "Don\u2019t worry, NASA isn\u2019t in charge of sending things into space anymore.\nNow it\u2019s focused on telling us that society is going to collapse unless we stop fueling the economy that, um, pays for NASA.\nStick with \u201cACA.\u201dAll the chirpy TV ads and Twitter hashtags in the world can\u2019t polish the turd that is Obamacare.\nAs November approaches, millions of Americans are itching to vote for the repeal of Obamacare.\nAnd \u201cObamacare\u201d went right out the window with his poll numbers."}
