Wayin replaced chief executive Elaine Feeney with its co-founder and chairman, Scott McNealy, the company confirmed Friday.

McNealy, who co-founded Sun Microsystems, started Wayin in 2011 as an aggregator of social media content for companies. It gained attention because McNealy chose Denver as Wayin’s headquarters instead of California, where he lives.

Over the years, Wayin has raised at least $33.5 million from investors. But it also has changed its focus. It currently helps customers promote and measure their social networking activity.

The management change is the result of “tremendous growth in the past two years” and looking to the future, according to Jordan Slabaugh, Wayin’s vice president of marketing.

“After leading Wayin through a momentous stage during her tenure as CEO, Elaine and the board of directors agreed the time was right to bring in a leader with the experience to take Wayin to the next level. We’re confident that we have all the right pieces in place to get Wayin to the next level and are extremely grateful for Elaine’s contributions,” Slabaugh said.

“Scott’s previous experience in leading aggressive expansion of enterprise companies in the technology space, paired with his involvement on the board, made him the obvious choice as a leader in this next phase.”

McNealy isn’t moving to Denver but expects to be in the office frequently. He will be the keynote speaker for the Colorado Venture Summit in June. The company employs 55 people.
