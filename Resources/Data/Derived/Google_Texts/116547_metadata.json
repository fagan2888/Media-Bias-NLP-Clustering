Already, likely candidates are planning book releases, reaching out to donors and booking travel to the early states.\n\nBut if the last weeks of 2014 were any indication, Obama has no intention of merely limping through his final two years, even though he faces a Republican-controlled Congress. And many of the issues he and GOP leaders must grapple with this year could affect the presidential race.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nObamacare remains vulnerable to unraveling, from both the judicial and legislative branches. NSA surveillance, immigration and Iran will all get moments on the front burner in the coming months. Some issues are sure to divide what looks to be a large and unwieldy 2016 Republican field. Others could provide a means to attack the likely Democratic front-runner, Hillary Clinton.\n\n( On POLITICO Magazine: 10 global elections to watch in 2015)\n\nAs far as when Clinton will announce her 2016 candidacy? That\u2019s still a mystery. Regardless, there are plenty of other key dates to watch for in 2015. Here\u2019s a sampling:\n\nJan. 13 \u2014 The book tours begin\n\nMarco Rubio\u2019s book, \u201cAmerican Dreams: Restoring Economic Opportunity for Everyone,\u201d comes out on the second Tuesday of January, the first in a slew of tomes being peddled by potential presidential candidates.\n\nSuch books, which tend to be anodyne at best, are a handy way for hopefuls to introduce themselves to activists on their own terms, give an excuse for travel to early primary states, generate media and make cash.\n\nRubio must decide whether to run for reelection to the Senate or for president; he\u2019s said he won\u2019t do both. What reception the 43-year-old Floridian gets will offer a window into his viability in a national race.\n\nFormer Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee\u2019s latest book, \u201cGod, Guns, Grits, and Gravy,\u201d comes out the Tuesday after Rubio\u2019s. The 2008 Iowa caucus winner, a favorite of social conservatives, is looking at a 2016 run. He announced Saturday he\u2019s leaving his Fox News show, and aides have even scoped out Little Rock office space. But many GOP insiders think he\u2019s bluffing, as he did in 2012, to get more attention for his TV show and book launch. Watch for Huckabee to sound serious on the book tour; the key is whether he pursues more early-state travel afterward.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: GOP searches for elusive Obamacare fix)\n\nSen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) will release a still-untitled book on May 12, and Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) plans to release his book (\u201cTaking a Stand: Moving Beyond Partisan Politics to Unite America\u201d) on June 2, which is around when he\u2019s said he\u2019ll make a formal announcement. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, also a Republican, is working on an e-book to come out early in the year, theoretically to lay out a rationale for his candidacy.\n\nJan. 20 \u2014 The State of the Union\n\nObama delivers his penultimate State of the Union address at 9 p.m. Eastern. He\u2019ll outline areas where he might be able to reach agreement with Republicans, but he\u2019s also likely to sound more liberated than in recent years, when he was determined to protect red-state Democrats. Last year, Obama stressed his willingness to use his executive authority when Congress does not take action.\n\nAs Obama heads into the twilight of his presidency, the State of the Union becomes less relevant. The more interesting speeches are likely to take place in state capitals, where several Republican governors considering presidential runs are getting sworn in or delivering State of the State addresses.\n\nWisconsin Gov. Scott Walker\u2019s is Monday, and Ohio Gov. John Kasich\u2019s is Jan. 12. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie will deliver his State of the State in mid-January, outlining what he might be able to get through a Democratic legislature.\n\nFeb. 24 \u2014 Chicago mayor\u2019s race\n\nRahm Emanuel, the former White House chief of staff, must get at least 50 percent of the vote to avoid an April 7 runoff in the race to lead the Windy City. The incumbent\u2019s most formidable challenger, the president of the city\u2019s teachers union, decided not to run after being diagnosed with a brain tumor last fall.\n\nEmanuel has a major fundraising advantage from his years as a Democratic fixer, but a Chicago Tribune poll last summer put his approval rating at 35 percent. He faces spirited attacks for being cozy with Wall Street, shuttering almost 50 schools as part of a restructuring, presiding during a spike in violent crime and scaling back public-employee retirement benefits.\n\nBecause there\u2019s no clear alternative to Emanuel, the February election is a referendum on his performance. He\u2019s running TV ads promoting his accomplishments and reassuring voters that he\u2019s rooting out endemic corruption.\n\nHe will probably prevail in the end, but it could require a boost from Obama. There are a few challengers who could split the vote and force a runoff.\n\nFeb. 25-28 \u2014 CPAC\n\nThe Conservative Political Action Conference is the year\u2019s first truly national cattle call for would-be 2016 Republican candidates. Thousands of activists descend on the Gaylord convention center just outside D.C. for three days of speeches.\n\nThe conference\u2019s closely watched straw poll shows who is up and who is down at a time when the GOP lacks a clear front-runner. Paul won the past two years, a barometer of the base\u2019s mood, with Cruz coming in second in 2014. Mitt Romney won four straw polls during his runs for president, but libertarian stalwart Ron Paul (Rand\u2019s father) won in 2010 and 2011.\n\nChristie was not invited two years ago because of perceived apostasy, including embracing Obama during Superstorm Sandy, but the New Jersey leader gave a well-received speech last year and will likely speak again in 2015.\n\nFeb. 27 \u2014 Immigration fight\n\nConservatives are still hopping mad over Obama\u2019s executive action protecting millions of undocumented immigrants from deportation. In February, they\u2019ll get a shot at weakening the president\u2019s hand.\n\nThe spending bill that passed during the lame duck session funds every part of the federal government through the end of September, except for the Department of Homeland Security, which includes key immigration agencies as well as the Secret Service and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nRepublicans agreed to extend DHS funding at current levels through the end of February as a compromise. They didn\u2019t want to shut down the government and figured they\u2019d have a stronger hand once the GOP controlled both chambers of Congress. This means that a funding bill for homeland security must pass in February, setting up a showdown over Obama\u2019s immigration order.\n\nRepublicans running for president will need to take a hard line, but Democrats are eager to use the funding fight to bolster their standing with Hispanics. Watch Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid in particular: the Democrat is up for reelection in Nevada in 2016, and he\u2019ll need solid Hispanic turnout.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio is one of several prospective 2016 candidates who plans on releasing a book and touring the country on a promotion tour.\n\nSpring surprise \u2014 New York special\n\nSpecial elections always get outsize media attention, mainly because not much else is going. But the race for outgoing GOP Rep. Michael Grimm\u2019s seat will be supercharged because it\u2019ll likely be the year\u2019s first special election, it\u2019s inside the country\u2019s largest media market, and it comes against a backdrop of racial unrest.\n\nGrimm is quitting his Staten Island-based seat after pleading guilty to a felony tax charge. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has not yet picked a date for the vote, but it should be in the spring.\n\nParty bosses get to pick their nominees, but Empire State specials are notoriously wild because third-party candidates can become spoilers. Democrats won upstate special elections in conservative districts the past few years when they capitalized on GOP divisions or turned the race into a referendum on some national issue.\n\nThis election seems destined to become a racially charged referendum on police tactics. The GOP front-runner is Daniel Donovan, the prosecutor who oversaw a grand jury investigation that declined to file charges against police caught on camera choking Eric Garner, a black man who kept saying he couldn\u2019t breathe and later died.\n\nThe killings of two New York police officers last month have only added to the tensions. Whites make up more than 70 percent of Grimm\u2019s district, and it is home to many police officers, but the nonindictment was controversial even among Republicans.\n\nMarch 19 \u2014 Hillary\u2019s last paid speech\n\nOne of 2015\u2019s biggest questions is when Hillary Clinton will formally announce she\u2019s running for president.\n\nThe former secretary of state has committed to delivering the keynote address on March 19 at a conference organized by the New York and New Jersey chapter of the American Camp Association.\n\nShe could always cancel this engagement, or she might also choose to roll out her candidacy soon after this. Many on her team believe the Democrat erred during her last run by announcing too early, in January 2007.\n\nClinton is also giving paid speeches in Silicon Valley and Canada in late February, earning as much as $300,000 a pop , sums that have already opened her up to criticism.\n\nApril 6 \u2014 Opening Day in D.C.\n\nThe Washington Nationals\u2019 first home game of the new season is against the New York Mets at 4:05 p.m. on this day. It\u2019s an unofficial holiday in the Capitol, and many POLITICOs will go off the grid for the afternoon. So we\u2019d be grateful if the people we write about don\u2019t use this as an opportunity for a news dump.\n\nJune 1 \u2014 Surveillance powers expire\n\nWithout congressional action, the National Security Agency will lose legal authority for the bulk collection of American phone records and other intelligence-gathering powers that the administration says are crucial to stop terrorist attacks.\n\nSection 215 of the PATRIOT Act established the NSA\u2019s authority to collect business records and is set to expire because of a sunset provision included in the law. Leaks by Edward Snowden revealed the extent to which this statute is used to get call records from phone companies. A compromise bill last month, which would have narrowed the scope of information that can be collected but allowed it to continue, failed narrowly.\n\nThe issue creates unusual coalitions among civil libertarians on the left and right. On the Republican side, Rubio is a staunch supporter of NSA eavesdropping in the name of national security. Cruz and Rand Paul both speak out against it; Cruz voted for the USA Freedom Act in December because it restricted some of the activity, but Paul opposed it because he said it extends too much that\u2019s wrong with the PATRIOT Act.\n\nSomething is likely to pass because incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell supports the administration on NSA surveillance. But the Republican base is divided, and the issue is dicey because most politicians want to at least nod to American fears about government surveillance.\n\nMid-to-late June \u2014 Obamacare decision\n\nThe Supreme Court will decide whether the Affordable Care Act gives millions of people a federal subsidy to buy health insurance.\n\nPlaintiffs in the case argue that the subsidies can be given only to those people who live in states that have created their own health exchanges, which would mean that residents of more than 30 states do not qualify.\n\nThe court will hear oral arguments in March and likely hand down a decision near the end of its term in June. At least four justices agreed to review whether an appeals court was right to uphold the subsidies, not a good sign for the Obama administration.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts infuriated conservatives when he upheld the health law\u2019s individual mandate three years ago; if he rules against the subsidies in the closely divided court this time, Obamacare could be dealt a devastating blow, as millions of Americans may no longer be able to afford their current health plans.\n\nChicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel could face a runoff if multiple challengers force the electorate to split the vote.\n\nJune 30 \u2014 Iran deal deadline\n\nIn a recent interview, Obama would not rule out that the United States might someday have an embassy in Tehran, drawing predictable grumbling from conservatives who believe that the president is naive.\n\nIn any case, such diplomatic ties are even less realistic if the U.S. fails to strike a deal with the Islamic Republic on its nuclear program. A successful agreement, on the other hand, would be something Obama could point to as an achievement, while also giving the GOP some 2016 ammunition against Democrats \u2014 in particular Clinton, a former secretary of state.\n\nA preliminary accord \u2014 to get the Iranians to halt their nuclear program in exchange for the easing of economic sanctions \u2014 was extended to June 30. Low-level talks between the P5+1 \u2014 the United States, France, Germany, Russia, China and Britain \u2014 are set to resume Jan. 15 in Geneva.\n\nThe Iranians demand that the West lift all of its sanctions at once. Agreeing to that, even as part of a grand bargain, would cause big headaches for Obama with pro-Israel groups as well as many Republicans.\n\nAugust \u2014 Ames Straw Poll\n\nIowa Gov. Terry Branstad has said he\u2019d like to do away with the summer straw poll, which tends to benefit right-wing alternatives to the establishment favorite.\n\nIn 2011, for instance, Michele Bachmann won the poll, prompting Tim Pawlenty to drop out. Bachmann\u2019s collapse began the very next day, and Pawlenty might have emerged as a more serious Romney alternative if he\u2019d avoided Ames in the first place.\n\nBut the carnival-like event, which is held in a college town, is a big fundraiser for the state party, and Iowans like it because campaigns pay to bus them in for a day of fun, including free food and music.\n\nThe Iowa GOP central committee will meet Jan. 10 to vote on what the Ames gathering should look like and whether it should include a straw poll. Prominent Republicans, like Rep. Steve King, are pushing hard to make the 2015 version just as big as 2011\u2019s.\n\nSept. 16 \u2014 First Republican debate?\n\nThe Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation announced, before the midterm elections, that it wants to host the first debate on Sept. 16 of this year. The first debate last time was May 2, 2011 \u2014 so this would start the debate season more than four months later.\n\nThe Republican National Committee has put in place strict new rules to limit the number of debates and force mainstream media hosts to include conservative moderators. An RNC panel is due to announce more details at its winter meeting this month in San Diego.\n\nThe Reagan debate is not yet officially sanctioned, and candidates who participate in non-RNC debates will not be allowed into the ones sponsored by the party. But no one says \u201cno\u201d to Nancy Reagan, especially the RNC. So it seems likely that this will kick things off.\n\nSept. 30 \u2014 A funding deadline looms\n\nCongress must pass appropriations bills by the end of September. No one wants another government shutdown, but brinkmanship seems inevitable between the Republican Congress and the Democratic president, especially over the fate of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nWith the primaries in full swing, it\u2019s easy to see Cruz, Paul or Rubio using this moment to take a stand.\n\nCruz became a national figure in 2013 when his push to defund Obamacare led to a government shutdown. On the other hand, McConnell, the incoming Senate leader of the GOP, will be looking to protect the seven Republican Senate incumbents up for reelection in 2016 in states that Obama carried twice.\n\nThe GOP will probably try to defund the health law in the spring budget process because budgets cannot be filibustered and thus need only 51 votes. But Obama would veto any budget that rolls back his signature achievement. The real test, then, will come in late September when Republicans have their truest chance to block money for implementing the law.\n\nOct. 15 \u2014 Fundraising reports\n\nThis is one of the most important days of the year for White House hopefuls.\n\nThe candidates\u2019 third-quarter fundraising hauls will be closely scrutinized and offer a window into how viable they are ahead of the first primaries. The quarter ends Sept. 30, and the campaigns have until Oct. 15 to roll out their numbers.\n\nWhoever emerges as the left\u2019s main alternative to Clinton will need to put up a big haul to be taken seriously. The results could also show whether someone is catching fire with rich progressives in Hollywood and New York.\n\nOn the Republican side, assuming Bush is in, the question will be who can compete with him financially. Christie should be able to raise a lot of money; he has big problems if he cannot. If someone like Paul can post hauls on par with the other big-name contenders, he\u2019s truly in contention for the nomination and set to exceed his father\u2019s 2012 performance.\n\nNov. 3 \u2014 Kentucky governor\u2019s race\n\nThere are three Southern governors races in this off year. Republicans will very likely hold Louisiana and Mississippi. The question is whether they can pick up Kentucky.\n\nOutgoing Democratic Gov. Steve Beshear, a Blue Dog who is strongly supportive of the Affordable Care Act, remains popular. Attorney General Jack Conway, who lost to Rand Paul in 2010\u2019s Senate race, is likely to be the Democratic nominee for governor, while Agriculture Commissioner James Comer is the likely Republican nominee. Both, though, could face primaries.\n\nIf Comer beats Conway, it will signal that Democrats cannot compete in the South as long as Obama is president. And it would highlight how unrealistic the idea is that Hillary Clinton could truly expand the map in 2016. If Conway wins, however, he will become a national star and help show Democrats a path forward in the South.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "There's plenty of action leading up to the 2016 presidential election.", "title": "Calendar pols: A guide to 2015's key dates", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/01/2015-politics-calendar-113962.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2015/01/04/20150105_roadmap_gty_1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "2016 Elections,CPAC,Elections,Mike Huckabee,Iran,Daniel Donovan,John Kasich,Iran Nuclear Prog,Marco Rubio,Rand Paul,Books,NSA,Obamacare,New York,Scott Walker,Hillary Clinton,Chicago,Supreme Court,Michael Grimm,Barack Obama,State Of The Union,Washington Nationals,Baseball,Surveillance,Immigration,Chris Christie,Rahm Emanuel,Ted Cruz", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "There's plenty of action leading up to the 2016 presidential election.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb95d\"", "article_summary": "Some issues are sure to divide what looks to be a large and unwieldy 2016 Republican field.\nFeb. 25-28 \u2014 CPACThe Conservative Political Action Conference is the year\u2019s first truly national cattle call for would-be 2016 Republican candidates.\nThe Republican National Committee has put in place strict new rules to limit the number of debates and force mainstream media hosts to include conservative moderators.\nWatch for Huckabee to sound serious on the book tour; the key is whether he pursues more early-state travel afterward.\nIf Comer beats Conway, it will signal that Democrats cannot compete in the South as long as Obama is president."}
