Some of the claims about its growth have been overstated.\n\nBut this data, from economists Lawrence F. Katz and Alan B. Krueger\u2019s new paper on \u201cThe Rise and Nature of Alternative Work Arrangements in the United States, 1995-2015,\u201d is for real. After barely changing between 1995 and 2005, the share of U.S. workers in alternative work arrangements jumped from 10.1 percent in 2005 to 15.8 percent in 2015. (This was first reported last month in The Wall Street Journal.)\n\nThat\u2019s a pretty big leap. As Katz and Krueger write, \u201cAll of the net employment growth in the U.S. economy from 2005 to 2015 appears to have occurred in alternative work arrangements.\u201d\n\nThese arrangements for the most part did not involve work arranged through online gig-economy platforms \u2013 only about 0.5 percent of workers \u201cidentify customers through an online intermediary,\u201d Katz and Krueger found.\n\nThey do speculate that \u201ctechnological changes that lead to enhanced monitoring, standardize job tasks and make information on worker reputation more widely available\u201d have helped bring about the rise in alternative work. Other possible causes that they cite include shifts in the age and education characteristics of the workforce (more on that in a moment), the Affordable Care Act (which generally makes it easier for independent workers to get health insurance), corporate efforts to boost profits by contracting out more work and the lingering effects of the Great Recession.\n\nThe Katz-Krueger survey was designed to be compatible with an earlier data series from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which asked workers about contingent and alternative work arrangements in 1995, 1997, 1999, 2001 and 2005, before stopping for lack of funding. Labor Secretary Tom Perez announced in January that the survey will be conducted again in May 2017, but Katz and Krueger had already conducted a smaller version as part of the Rand American Life Panel last October and November.\n\nThe differences between Katz\u2019s and Krueger\u2019s 15.8 percent finding and the higher percentages reported in some other recent surveys mainly have to do with definitions. The Government Accountability Office\u2019s April 2015 estimate that 40.4 percent of U.S. workers were in alternative work arrangements included part-time workers as well as some self-employed workers not covered under the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 definition of alternative work.\n\nIt was also based on a survey conducted in 2010, when the percentage of involuntary part-time workers was still quite elevated in the wake of the recession. The 2015 Freelancing in America survey that deemed 34 percent of U.S. workers to be freelancers included moonlighters who already had other jobs, as well as some small-business owners with employees.\n\nThese different ways of counting aren\u2019t wrong \u2013 moonlighters, for example, seem to be a big factor in the online gig economy, and Katz and Krueger miss them by counting only people whose main job involves alternative work arrangements. Katz and Krueger do that, though, to allow for comparison with past Bureau of Labor Statistics surveys \u2013 and that comparability is informative.\n\nIt reveals, for instance, that workers ages 55 to 75 and workers with a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher have always (since 1995, at least) been more likely than others to be in alternative work arrangements. As a result, rising education levels and the aging of the population account for part of the overall growth in alternative work.\n\nBut the share of older and better-educated workers in alternative work arrangements has also continued to rise, at a pace faster than that of the rest of the workforce. Moreover, the 55-plussers are the only age category in the U.S. that has seen its employment-to-population ratio rise over the past two decades.\n\nWhat this may mean is that the growth of the gig economy, at least the growth measured by Katz and Krueger, is being driven not so much by struggling millennials lining up gigs online as by 60-year-olds working as independent contractors. What\u2019s not clear is whether they\u2019re doing this because they\u2019re semi-retired and value freedom and flexibility, or because they\u2019ve been downsized out of a full-time, full-benefit job and have to settle for contract work.\n\nSometimes the gig economy empowers, sometimes it oppresses. But at least we now know that it really is growing.\n\nJustin Fox is a Bloomberg View columnist writing about business.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Daily Republic", "description": "Much ink and many pixels have been spilled over the past few years about the rise of the gig economy, sharing economy, on-demand economy, 1099 economy, freelancer economy or whatever you prefer to ...", "title": "Older people power on-demand economy", "url": "http://www.dailyrepublic.com/opinion/statenationalcolumnists/older-people-are-powering-the-on-demand-economy/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2016-04-07T07:02:01-07:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-06T21:35:51-07:00", "author": "http://www.dailyrepublic.com/author/justinfox/"}, "twitter": {"site": "@AllDailyRepNews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@AllDailyRepNews"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.2.4", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Much ink and many pixels have been spilled over the past few years about the rise of the gig economy, sharing economy, on-demand economy, 1099 economy, freelancer economy or whatever you prefer to call it.\nAfter barely changing between 1995 and 2005, the share of U.S. workers in alternative work arrangements jumped from 10.1 percent in 2005 to 15.8 percent in 2015.\nAs a result, rising education levels and the aging of the population account for part of the overall growth in alternative work.\nBut the share of older and better-educated workers in alternative work arrangements has also continued to rise, at a pace faster than that of the rest of the workforce.\nThe Government Accountability Office\u2019s April 2015 estimate that 40.4 percent of U.S. workers were in alternative work arrangements included part-time workers as well as some self-employed workers not covered under the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 definition of alternative work."}
