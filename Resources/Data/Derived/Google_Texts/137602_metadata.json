It was nearly the size of a watermelon. She hadn\u2019t been aware of its presence, despite suffering breathlessness and fatigue for years, as well as an expanded stomach where the tumor was weighing down on her uterus and bladder.\n\nThe surgery \u201cwent on for three-and-a-half hours,\u201d according to surgical gastroenterologist Dr. Shiva Kumar. It was \u201cchallenging as the fibroid, which takes blood supply to grow, had a lot of blood vessels attached to it. It was also stuck to the small bowel and omentum and was also pressing on the uterus. We had to carefully slice through and detach it.\u201d In addition to the tumor removal, the surgeons cut out her uterus in order to prevent the tumor from growing back.\n\nWhen she arrived in the hospital last month bleeding heavily, doctors identified the tumor and saw that she was anemic \u2014 and were \u201cshocked\u201d to discover the massive growth, Dr. Mani Mekalai, head of the hospital\u2019s department of obstetrics and gynecology, told The Daily Mail. \u201cIn medical parlance, this is called a super giant uterine fibroid and the largest one removed before this, in Africa, weighed 21lbs,\u201d Mekalai said. \u201cFrom the sheer size of it, the tumor could have easily been there for more than 20 years.\u201d\n\nUterine fibroids are actually relatively common, and are muscular tumors that grow inside the uterus wall. They are almost always benign, and can grow from the size of an apple seed to as big as a grapefruit or, in unusual cases, much bigger. According to the Office on Women\u2019s Health, nearly 20 to 80 percent of all women develop some form of fibroid by age 50. They don\u2019t always have symptoms, but some women may experience pain or heavy menstrual bleeding. In addition, women who are obese have a higher risk for fibroids, as well as women who eat a lot of red meat and ham.\n\nResearchers aren\u2019t entirely sure what causes fibroids, but some have linked it to estrogen in the past. The Office on Women\u2019s Health writes: \u201cBecause no one knows for sure what causes fibroids, we also don't know what causes them to grow or shrink. We do know that they are under hormonal control \u2014 both estrogen and progesterone. They grow rapidly during pregnancy, when hormone levels are high. They shrink when anti-hormone medication is used. They also stop growing or shrink once a woman reaches menopause.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "fibroid, biggest tumor, uterine tumor", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A 52-year-old Indian woman was not aware that a watermelon-sized tumor was growing inside her, but has had it safely removed.", "title": "World\u2019s Biggest Tumor, Weighing 30lbs, Removed From Woman\u2019s Uterus", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/indian-woman-has-watermelon-sized-tumor-removed-uterus-weighing-30lbs-its-one-worlds-biggest-286990", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/06/tumor-growth.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A 52-year-old Indian woman was not aware that a watermelon-sized tumor was growing inside her, but has had it safely removed.", "title": "World\u2019s Biggest Tumor, Weighing 30lbs, Removed From Woman\u2019s Uterus", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/indian-woman-has-watermelon-sized-tumor-removed-uterus-weighing-30lbs-its-one-worlds-biggest-286990", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/06/tumor-growth.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/06/tumor-growth.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-06-06T18:22:53-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-06T18:25:06-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A 52-year-old Indian woman was not aware that a watermelon-sized tumor was growing inside her, but has had it safely removed."}, "article_summary": "Researchers aren\u2019t entirely sure what causes fibroids, but some have linked it to estrogen in the past.\nThe 52-year-old woman, identified only as Latha, underwent a complex operation in Chennai, India, in order to remove the tumor.\nThe Office on Women\u2019s Health writes: \u201cBecause no one knows for sure what causes fibroids, we also don't know what causes them to grow or shrink.\nA tumor in a woman\u2019s uterus, weighing 30 pounds and measuring about 21 inches in diameter, has become one of the biggest tumors in the world since its recent removal in India.\nShe hadn\u2019t been aware of its presence, despite suffering breathlessness and fatigue for years, as well as an expanded stomach where the tumor was weighing down on her uterus and bladder."}
