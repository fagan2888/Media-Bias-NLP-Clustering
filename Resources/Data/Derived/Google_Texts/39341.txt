Texas Sen. Ted Cruz doesn't like Obamacare. But he likes “Green Eggs and Ham.” Not only the book, the Dr. Seuss classic, but also the dish. Green eggs and ham.



Seems appropriate for someone who spent fully 21 hours on the Senate floor, endlessly yakking, hamming it up – toward no purpose whatsoever.



The freshman Republican, the darling of the tea partiers, talked and talked and talked last week – ostensibly because he doesn’t want the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 to become law. Except that it already is the law of the land, passed by the Congress, signed by the president, upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court.



But that’s not enough to have kept Cruz from his antics.



Because the newly minted senator really had something else on his mind, had another, unstated goal: promoting himself.



It has been clear for some time now that Cruz, just nine months in the U.S. Senate, has been making all the moves of someone who plans to seek his party’s nomination for the presidency. This is why he was critical of fellow Republicans even as he talked up a blue streak about “Green Eggs and Ham” and actor Ashton Kutcher and did an impression of Darth Vader and quoted Ayn Rand and Rush Limbaugh’s father and, well, you get the point.



He had a yak attack. On the floor of the U.S. Senate.



Anyone who caught even a brief moment of the senator’s talk-a-thon could see that shameless self-promotion was the name of his game. Through and through.



Which isn’t to suggest that Cruz likes Obamacare. Or that he doesn’t like “Green Eggs and Ham.”



But what he quite obviously likes most of all is the sound of his own voice, the idea of himself at center stage.
