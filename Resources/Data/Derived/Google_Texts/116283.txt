Colorado senior Pierce Murphy secured two top-five finishes in distance events at the NCAA Indoor Championships this weekend, capping his indoor track career for the Buffaloes with a pair of All-American honors.

Murphy, who finished third last fall at the NCAA cross country championships, secured his second All-American designation in the 5,000 meters Friday night in Birmingham, Ala., with a third-place finish in 13 minutes, 52.22 seconds. He followed that with a fifth-place finish in the 3K on Saturday night in 8:02.40. Oregon junior Edward Cheserek won both events.

In the men’s 5K, Colorado senior Morgan Pearson was sixth in 13:53.22 and Colorado State junior Jerrell Mock was 14th in 14:07.09 — a finish that earned him the university’s first All-American designation in the event. In the men’s 3K, Colorado State junior Jefferson Abbey was just behind Murphy in 8:02.43, Air Force senior Patrick Corona was ninth in 8:03.12, and Colorado senior Connor Winter was 10th in 8:04.23 in his nationals debut.

Colorado’s Erin Clark finished fifth in the 3K in 9:08.63 and teammate Kaitlyn Benner was eighth in 9:09.66. In the women’s 5K on Friday night, the lone Colorado representative was Air Force senior Hannah Everson, who finished seventh in 16:04.86.

In the field events, Colorado State sophomore Mostafa Hassan was fifth in the shotput with a throw of 64-11¼ inches, a mark two feet farther than his season best. Hassan will compete next week at the World Indoor Track and Field Championships in Portland, Ore., representing Egypt.

Oregon swept the team titles on the men’s and women’s side.

Colorado, a distance running powerhouse, stacks the long-distance events with top runners — five competed between the men’s and women’s squads this weekend — and doesn’t typically compete for overall team championships, which requires a team filled out with sprinters, jumpers, throwers and those specialized in multievents. The relative brevity of the indoor season and the slower overall times means it doesn’t hold as much clout as the outdoor season, which the Buffs will open Friday with a home meet at CU.
