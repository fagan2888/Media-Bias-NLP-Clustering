The Shift From Volume to Value Healthcare - Implications on the Clinical Workforce

Monday, June 20, 2016 | 1:00PM - 2:00PM CDT

The US spends over $3 trillion dollars in health care, over 17% of GDP, with a lion’s share of expenditures driven by nearly 100 million US adults age 50-plus. Since the passing of the Affordable Care Act in 2010, our health care system has been in a state of transformation, accelerating the shift from volume-to-value (V2V) based payments. These market forces have had a dramatic impact on health consumers and the changing demographics of the US healthcare workforce. Over 14 million US citizens work in the health care industry and need to adjust to the new environment. The V2V shift is not only financial; it has significant implications on health systems’ culture and workforce.
