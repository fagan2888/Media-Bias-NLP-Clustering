We need to make sure they know how important it is to every Kansan in the state.\u201d\n\nThe group says expansion would help Kansans the estimated 150,000 Kansans that do not qualify for subsidy through the Affordable Care Act but also cannot afford a private plan.\n\nMarcillene Dover, a student who suffers from Multiple sclerosis, said she falls into the health care coverage gap.\n\n\u201cThe majority of the people that would qualify for KanCare expansion are working,\u201d said Dover. \u201cWe\u2019re not looking for a handout. We just can\u2019t afford the expensive premiums under the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nDover said she is currently receiving health coverage through Project Access in Sedgwick County.\n\nDavid Toland, executive director of Thrive Allen County, said that legislature is \u201cknowingly inflecting pain\u201d on rural communities by not expanding KanCare.\n\n\u201cRural Kansas has plenty of challenges as it is,\u201d said Toland. \u201cWe don't need more headwinds working against us and what's happening with the lack of KanCare expansion is that small communities are suffering and needlessly so.\u201d\n\nOpponents say KanCare expansion would be costly to Kansans taxpayers and there are alternatives to expansion.\n\n\u201cRepublicans recently approved creative and innovative solutions that actually expand healthcare access, such as through charity care and the physician licensure compact that increases patient options for telemedicine and medical specialists,\u201d said Kansas House Speaker Ray Merrick (R-Stillwell) in an emailed statement.\n\nEileen Hawley, spokesperson for Governor Sam Brownback, said the Governor will not support an expansion plan that doesn\u2019t have a work requirement or puts the needs of able-bodied adults above the needs of the disabled and vulnerable citizens.\n\n\u201cThe state would be responsible for all added administrative costs as well as its higher share of coverage for other eligible citizens outside the expansion group who enroll,\u201d said Hawley. \u201cThe claim that Medicaid will add thousands of new jobs has been repeatedly disproven.\u201d\n\nAlliance for a Healthy Kansas said they have a coalition of 100 community leaders and organizations that are joining their efforts. They plan to send postcards, knock on doors, and make phone calls until election day.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Alliance for a Healthy Kansas launched a campaign to urge state lawmakers to expand KanCare, the state\u2019s Medicaid program, at the Statehouse on Thursday.", "language": "english", "author": "Jace Mills", "og": {"url": "http://www.wibw.com/content/news/Group-to-campaign-for-KanCare-expansion-378725281.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/KanCare-advocate.png", "type": "article", "description": "Alliance for a Healthy Kansas launched a campaign to urge state lawmakers to expand KanCare, the state\u2019s Medicaid program, at the Statehouse on Thursday.", "title": "Group campaigns for KanCare expansion"}, "twitter": {"description": "Alliance for a Healthy Kansas launched a campaign to urge state lawmakers to expand KanCare, the state\u2019s Medicaid program, at the Statehouse on Thursday.", "title": "Group campaigns for KanCare expansion", "url": "http://www.wibw.com/content/news/Group-to-campaign-for-KanCare-expansion-378725281.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/KanCare-advocate.png", "creator": "@wibw", "site": "@wibw", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "Group campaigns for KanCare expansion", "fb": {"app_id": 127891188221, "pages": 334421824439}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "google-site-verification": "xKK4ktPtBfFVLdzIx__cOn-VV5eDQAJ3ZPOJKffAg_I", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Group campaigns for KanCare expansion"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWe don't need more headwinds working against us and what's happening with the lack of KanCare expansion is that small communities are suffering and needlessly so.\u201dOpponents say KanCare expansion would be costly to Kansans taxpayers and there are alternatives to expansion.\n\u201cWe will be active in every single legislative district during this interim session since the legislature failed to expand KanCare this year.\n\u201cThe majority of the people that would qualify for KanCare expansion are working,\u201d said Dover.\nAlliance for a Healthy Kansas launched a campaign to urge state lawmakers to expand KanCare, the state\u2019s Medicaid program, at the Statehouse on Thursday.\n(WIBW/Jace Mills)\u201cWe came here to kick-off our campaign,\u201d said David Jordan, executive director of Alliance for a Healthy Kansas."}
