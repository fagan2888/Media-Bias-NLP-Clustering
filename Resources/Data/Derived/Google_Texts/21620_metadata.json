Say it ain\u2019t so! In the past, the Broncos have let an unknown running back go for more than 200 yards in the big game, let Doug Williams rack up the most lop-sided Super Bowl win and now allow Seattle to record the third most lop-sided win. Records \u2026 we got records!\n\n\u201cWe were all ready for the party, then the first snap happened,\u201d said Stacey Linn, who is using the loss as a life-lesson for her kids. \u201cI just told them sometimes you win and sometimes you lose, what makes you better is being good at both.\u201d\n\nFor guys playing lunch-time basketball, this loss was almost like an air-ball from the corner. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know what team showed up \u2026 was that the Broncos?\u201d asked Eric Zaporian. Courtney Samuel said, \u201cThey are professional and get paid a lot for doing what they do, if they can get over it \u2026 we need to as well.\u201d\n\nA bad day at Black Rock for sure for the home team, but as banners \u2013 blue and orange\u2014 still wave in Mile High, Dr. Doug Jowdy, who has counseled Olympic and youth athletes alike, says use what the Seahawks did to let your kids know the importance of being a good winner as well as a good loser, as Peyton Manning was when the final seconds ticked away.\n\n\u201cDetermination, hope, strength and heart are lessons kids can take away from the game, knowing how to take a whipping and keep on ticking so to speak!\u201d\n\nHey, if your blue funk continues, just stay positive \u2026 there are only 363 days until SB XLIX! Go Broncos!", "article_metadata": {"description": "DENVER -- Broncos fans couldn't believe what happened to their team in the Super Bowl.
