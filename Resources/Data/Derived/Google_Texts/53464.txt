The Miss USA organization has invited Caitlyn Jenner to judge this year’s beauty pageant in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.

“While she is not yet confirmed to judge, the organization would indeed love to have her and are reaching out to make an offer,” the organization said in a statement, USA Today reported.

The Miss USA beauty pageant is held annually to select the American entrant in the Miss Universe pageant — the only pageant system that allows transgender contestants.

It was revealed in Vanity Fair’s July issue that Caitlyn Jenner, formerly Bruce, picked her new moniker while watching Miss America and trying out names of the contestants.

“It’s one of the hardest things in life — choosing your own name,” she told the magazine.

This year’s Miss USA pageant will air July 12 on NBC at 8 p.m. ET.
