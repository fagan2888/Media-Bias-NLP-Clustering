While legal, abortion was still viewed by many as a form of deviant behavior. The stigma remained. Few wanted to label themselves as \u201cpro-abortion\u201d and the pro-choice phrase was enlisted to describe those in favor of abortion rights but unwilling to say the ugly word. But it was always implied when those favoring abortion rights described themselves as \u201cin favor of a woman\u2019s right to choose.\u201d Everyone knew the code. Everyone knew that the woman\u2019s right to choose was always \u201cfor abortion.\u201d\n\nStill, the euphemistic \u201cchoice\u201d seemed to work for nearly four decades. It has been used by \u201cpro-choice\u201d Catholic politicians including Nancy Pelosi, Joe Biden and long list of Kennedys and Cuomos who constantly insist on the need to protect a woman\u2019s right to choose. Such Catholic politicians could speak in code\u0097reassuring voters that they would vote in favor of abortion without ever saying the word \u201cabortion\u201d. But, like all euphemisms, what is hidden often remains clear, and as the culture has begun to move steadily in the pro-life direction, the pro-choice phrase began to seem a bit too explicit.\n\nPlanned Parenthood has realized that. Polling funded by Planned Parenthood in 2012 appeared to \u201cshow some dissatisfaction with the labels.\u201d In the poll, 7% of self-described pro-choice voters thought Roe v Wade should be overturned. And in an online survey of recent voters, 12% said they were both pro-life and pro-choice, and another 12% said they would not use those terms. When asked for their moral opinions on abortion, 40% of those voters said \u201cit depends on the situation.\u201d\n\nIn its article, \u201cPlanned Parenthood Moving Away from Choice\u201d, Buzzfeed.com described a 2013 press briefing in which Cecile Richards, Planned Parenthood president, said \u201cit\u2019s a complicated topic and one in which labels don\u2019t reflect the complexity.\u201d Richards added that \u201cthe groups polling showed most Americans could get behind a more nuanced statement of principles.\u201d Planned Parenthood Executive Vice President Dawn Laguens agreed, claiming that the word \u201cchoice itself might be causing problems\u2026When choice got assigned, women didn\u2019t have as many choices\u2026\u201d Since women now have more rights and freedoms, she said, maybe \u201c'choice\u2019 as word sounds frivolous.\u201d\n\nFor the past few years, Planned Parenthood has been trying to replace the \u201cpro-choice\u201d label with something else. Lauguens suggested that Planned Parenthood poll tested \u201cmaking abortion rare\u201d but it polled \u201cpoorly\u201d because women found it \u201cjudgmental and shaming.\u201d In response, Cecile Richards tried something \u201cmore nuanced.\u201d The euphemistic \u201cwomen\u2019s health issues\u201d was enlisted to fill the void, and for a while\u0097especially in the debate surrounding the funding for abortion and abortion inducing drugs in President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act\u0097the phrase \u201cwomen\u2019s health\u201d began to replace the pro-choice label. The manufactured \u201cRepublican War on Women\u201d was enlisted as code for attempts by pro-life politicians to restrict abortion. Instead of pro-choice, those same pro-abortion Catholic politicians who were \u201cpersonally opposed but pro-choice\u201d began to describe themselves as committed to \u201cwomen\u2019s health issues.\u201d They understood that their base would know they meant abortion, but they must have hoped that those who are beginning to have concerns about \u201ca woman\u2019s right to choose\u201d [abortion] might not be put off by the loaded phrase.\n\nIndeed, President Obama has been lauded by many within the Catholic academic world, including Pamela Trotman Reid, president of St. Joseph's College in West Hartford, Connecticut, who told a reporter for the Hartford Courant that Obama was a \"kindred spirit.\" As an African-American woman, Reid said that she would expect much from an Obama presidency and revealed her concerns about continuing women's access to abortion by saying that \"the next president is likely going to make appointments to the Supreme Court. That could affect the right of women to make choices about their own health. These are issues of incredible importance.\"\n\nThe fact that real health concerns about access to health care for men, women and children have arisen through the passage of healthcare \u201creform\u201d brought by the Affordable Care Act, suggests that \u201cwomen\u2019s health issues\u201d and \u201cWar on Women\u201d may in fact need to be replaced. However, a replacement for the pro-choice label has not yet been found. In fact, there are signs that the reliable \u201cpro-choice\u201d may be making a comeback.\n\nEarlier this year, the euphemistically named \u201cAbortion Care Network\u201d held what it called its first \u201cAbortion Stigma Busting Video Competition\u201d. Both of the winning videos focused on \u201cchoice.\u201d One of the two winners was a video entitled: \u201cWomen Have Abortions Every Day: It\u2019s Just One Choice,\u201d produced by the Irish Family Planning Association and the International Planned Parenthood Federation. In that video, women are portrayed as making the choice to have an abortion as a \u201cnormal\u201d choice like the decision to buy a condo or a car, go to graduate school, or get a divorce\u0097or obtain a restraining order against a spouse. Just one choice among many of the choices we make throughout our lives.\n\nIn the second award-winning video, Emily Letts, a twenty-five year old former actress\u0097she is now, a New Jersey abortion clinic counselor\u0097videotaped what she described as her \u201csurgical abortion\u201d procedure and submitted it for the competition to show others, as she told an interviewer for Philadelphia Magazine that she felt \u201csuper great about having an abortion.\u201d In the prize-winning video itself, Letts exclaims \u201ccool!\u201d after the abortion. In an essay for Cosmopolitan magazine Letts writes that she let a camera crew film her first trimester abortion in order to dispel some myths about what it is like to have an abortion: \u201cA first trimester abortion takes three to five minutes. It is safer than giving birth. There is no cutting, and risk of infertility is less than 1 percent.\u201d Throughout her videotaped \u201cabortion\u201d Letts explains that she is \u201cnot ready\u201d to have children. \u201cI\u2019m lucky because I feel completely comfortable with the decision. I\u2019m supported by everyone.\u201d Guitar music is faintly heard in the background throughout the video, and a kind doctor is heard reassuring Letts throughout the procedure. When the abortion is over, Letts smiles and says \u201cI feel good. I\u2019m done. Yay.\u201d\n\nWhile Letts claims that her award-winning video was created to diffuse some of the confusion that clouds the issue of abortion, her choice to make light of an abortion procedure created an uproar\u0097even in the pro-choice community. According to Lifesite news, the interviewer for Philadelphia Magazine, Victor Fiorillo said he had heard from many women \u201cwho self-identify as pro-choice\u201d who found the video \u201ccreepy\u201d, telling Letts, \u201csome said it should have been kept private some say that you were quite glib.\u201d\n\nCasey Fiano of Live Action News has joined others in the pro-life community to charge that Letts did not even have an abortion on that video. Kristen Iglesias at Clash Daily claims that the entire video was staged. Iglesias listed the inconsistencies and \u201cstrange coincidences\u201d that led her to believe that Letts, with the help of her employers at the Cherry Hill (New Jersey) Women\u2019s Center, fabricated the video. Letts claimed to be only two to three weeks pregnant\u0097highly suspicious no matter which way you look at it. According to Casey Fiano, \u201cwhile Letts claims that she chose to have a surgical abortion specifically for the sake of doing the video, that seems hard to believe. In order to have an aspiration abortion, a woman has to be at least six weeks pregnant.\u201d\n\nWhether Letts videotaped a real abortion or not is up for debate. More clear is the constant attempt by the pro-abortion side to define down the deviance of killing the unborn child in the womb\u0097and the continued failure to remove the stigma of abortion. The Planned Parenthood tee-shirts failed because very few women would want to stand up and say proudly, \u201cI had an abortion.\u201d Few purchased the shirts as most women are ashamed of such a thing. The post-abortion recovery community has stepped in to help women cope with their decision to have an abortion. Some never fully recover from such an act; they know that abortion can never be de-stigmatized. The deviance of such a barbaric act can never be defined down because no matter what euphemism the pro-abortion side chooses to call it, abortion is still killing a child and no one can ever be proud of such a thing.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Anne Hendershott", "description": "Defining Down the Deviance of Abortion Abortion supporters and provides have worked for decades to re-label and obscure real nature of killing unborn children in the womb Anne Hendershott"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1610\"", "article_summary": "There is no cutting, and risk of infertility is less than 1 percent.\u201d Throughout her videotaped \u201cabortion\u201d Letts explains that she is \u201cnot ready\u201d to have children.\nPlanned Parenthood has realized that.\nSuch Catholic politicians could speak in code\u0097reassuring voters that they would vote in favor of abortion without ever saying the word \u201cabortion\u201d.\nEarlier this year, the euphemistically named \u201cAbortion Care Network\u201d held what it called its first \u201cAbortion Stigma Busting Video Competition\u201d.\nPolling funded by Planned Parenthood in 2012 appeared to \u201cshow some dissatisfaction with the labels.\u201d In the poll, 7% of self-described pro-choice voters thought Roe v Wade should be overturned."}
