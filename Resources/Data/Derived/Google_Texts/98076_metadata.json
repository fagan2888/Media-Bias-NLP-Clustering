He said it was important for evangelical Christians to vote and said their failure to vote made a difference in the last presidential election.\n\n\u201cWhen you don\u2019t vote, you are voting,\u201d he said. \u201cThe secular progressives will encourage you not to vote. That\u2019s manipulation. They are people with a different set of values than us. Go out and get three people who didn\u2019t vote the last time. That\u2019s what we need.\u201d\n\nCarson said the Affordable Care Act, championed by President Obama, is a glaring example of how government has been transformed in his administration.\n\n\u201cThey are cramming it down our throats and if we don\u2019t like it, too bad. That\u2019s the transformation to a new order and it is dangerous,\u201d he said. \u201cThe government works for the people, not the other way around.\u201d\n\nCarson also criticized the media, saying it often lies or twists the truth. He urged the audience to stay informed, get involved and ask questions. \u201cThe media works on people who don\u2019t discern things for themselves,\u201d he said.\n\nHe touched on many specific issues, including:\n\nThe economy \u2014 He said the Obama administration touts the nation\u2019s decreasing unemployment rate, but said people who are eligible to work who aren\u2019t working is the worst it\u2019s been in 38 years. He also said the $18.5 trillion national debt helps insure this generation will be worse off than their parents.\n\nRadical Muslims \u2014 \u201cThey will destroy us if we don\u2019t destroy them first.\u201d He said the radicals hide among their population, making them hard to target. \u201cWe must draw them out and kill them. Obliterate them,\u201d he said. He said also the key is to cut off their oil and their supply routes. Carson said the best defense against terrorism at home and abroad is readiness. \u201cWe cannot allow political correctness to kill us,\u201d he said.\n\nIsrael \u2014 \u201cIsrael is our friend,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have turned our back on our friend. It seems to be a pattern. We have trouble building a coalition because other countries see how we\u2019re treating Israel and they don\u2019t trust us.\u201d\n\nSubsidies \u2014 Carson said, \u201cI have no desire to remove the safety nets from people who need them. I have a great desire to provide avenues of opportunity for people so they will not be dependent on safety nets.\u201d He said programs such as Social Security and Medicare are unfunded liabilities and that the ideal thing would be to get rid of all government subsidies.\n\nCarson said if he wanted to destroy the United States, he would drive wedges between various segments of the population, spend recklessly and weaken the military. \u201cAny similarity to what is happening today is purely coincidental,\u201d he said.\n\nCarson was accompanied by his wife, Candy, who led the crowd in the singing of the national anthem and participated with a group singing Christmas carols.\n\nWhen her husband was done speaking, she rose, stood beside him and said, \u201cI\u2019m Candy Carson, and I approved this message.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"Description": "The Gazette | MASON CITY - Dr. Ben Carson warned a Mason City audience Thursday not to allow 'secular progressives' to continue to run the country.The soft-spoken", "og": {"site_name": "The Gazette", "description": "MASON CITY - Dr. Ben Carson warned a Mason City audience Thursday not to allow 'secular progressives' to continue to run the country.", "url": "http://www.thegazette.com/subject/news/politics/election/republican-presidential/carson-chides-progressives-in-mason-city-campaign-stop-20151217", "image": "http://www.thegazette.com/storyimage/GA/20151217/ARTICLE/151219686/AR/0/AR-151219686.jpg", "article": {"section": "Default"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thegazette.com/subject/news/politics/election/republican-presidential/carson-chides-progressives-in-mason-city-campaign-stop-20151217", "description": "MASON CITY - Dr. Ben Carson warned a Mason City audience Thursday not to allow 'secular progressives' to continue to run the country.", "site": "@gazettedotcom", "title": "Carson chides progressives in Mason City campaign stop"}, "fb": {"app_id": 163646090334606}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "bt": {"modDate": "2015-12-17T21:04:00-05:00", "type": "thegazette_default", "pubDate": "2015-12-17T21:04:13-05:00", "title": "Carson chides progressives in Mason City campaign stop"}, "MobileOptimized": 320, "apple-touch-fullscreen": "yes", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "By John Skipper, Mason City Globe-GazetteMASON CITY \u2014 Dr. Ben Carson warned a Mason City audience Thursday not to allow \u201csecular progressives\u201d to continue to run the country.\nHe used the term \u201csecular progressives\u201d several times to drive home his points.\nRadical Muslims \u2014 \u201cThey will destroy us if we don\u2019t destroy them first.\u201d He said the radicals hide among their population, making them hard to target.\n\u201cWhen you don\u2019t vote, you are voting,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe secular progressives will encourage you not to vote."}
