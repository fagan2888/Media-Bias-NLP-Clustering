After they were married, they lived in California, where Rolf taught sociology at the University of California-Davis, and in West Germany, where he taught at Regensburg University. In 1971, Rolf joined the CU-Boulder faculty.

Silvia re-entered medical school and graduated from Universidad Aut√≥noma Metropolitana in Mexico City, in 1986. Meanwhile, Rolf was a professor at the University of Hannover in Germany, where he resided with their oldest son.

Their sons, Pablo and Francisco, were born in Mexico City. Their daughter Silvita, was born at Boulder Community Health. Rolf and Silvia consider both cities their home.

Rolf, now a professor emeritus at CU , has many photography projects, including those at the Carnavalet Museum and French National Library (Paris).
