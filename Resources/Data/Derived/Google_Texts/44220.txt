GILBERT, Ariz. (AP) — Gilbert police say a woman who allegedly shot her father was acting in self-defense during a family dispute.

Lt. Hugh White says officers responded to reports of a domestic disturbance at a home just before 8 a.m. Sunday.

Investigators say 47-year-old Douglas Holt and 52-year-old Rosanna Holt were arguing.

Their daughter, 21-year-old Jamie Holt, wounded her father in the leg as he was allegedly coming at her with a knife.

White says the daughter’s boyfriend, 24-year-old Skylar East, struck Douglas Holt in the head with a bottle.

Douglas Holt was hospitalized for non-life-threatening injuries.

Rosanna Holt was hospitalized for wounds suffered during the argument.

Police say Douglas Holt will likely face charges of aggravated assault and disorderly conduct.

It’s not clear if anyone else will.
