Stephen Fahnholz.\n\nThe garage, which abutted a home at the rear of 203 Fifth Ave., also caught fire and was soon engulfed.\n\nThe fire then spread to two adjacent Beach Avenue homes, Fahnholz said.\n\nOn Sunday morning, firefighters from Bradley Beach and Avon dug through the still smoldering rubble to extinguish the last of the embers.\n\nThe rear of the home at 203 Fifth Avenue was burned away and its roof partially collapsed.\n\nOne of the adjacent Beach Avenue homes, where fire melted its blue-gray vinyl siding, was uninhabitable, Fahnholz said. The neighboring Beach Avenue home was without power, but sustained no serious damage. Families in both homes were displaced on Sunday morning.\n\nThe Fifth Avenue home, which sustained the most serious damage, was vacant at the time of the fire, Fahnholz said.\n\n- A shed fire spread to three Bradley Beach homes early Sunday morning and displaced two Beach Avenue families, police said (Photo: Amanda Oglesby)\n\nNo one was injured.\n\nThe fire is under investigation by the Bradley Beach Fire Marshal, Bradley Beach police detectives and the Monmouth County Fire Marshal.\n\nFire departments and first aiders from Neptune, Neptune City and Ocean Grove also assisted at the scene, along with the Monmouth County EMS Task Force.\n\nAmanda Oglesby: 732-557-5701; aoglesby@GannettNJ.com\n\nDon't miss a thing Download our apps and get alerts for local news, weather, traffic and more.
