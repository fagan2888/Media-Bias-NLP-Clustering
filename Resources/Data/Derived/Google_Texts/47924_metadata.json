Will you have clicked out of this link already?\n\nBefore I tell you my thoughts on the matter, you should know that you\u2019re reading the opinion of an enthusiastic optimist: one of the few living souls in journalism who still believes that celebrity op-eds are not dying\u2026 they\u2019re just coming alive.\n\nThere are many (many) people who think that celebrities come across as laughable parodies of their personae in the op-eds they pen. I am not one of them. In my opinion, the value of a celebrity op-ed is, and will continue to be, based on how on-brand a celebrity can come across in the body of work, and the click value celebrities can bring when their op-eds go out into the marketplace. Content farming has shrunk the numbers on celebrity op-eds drastically, and every celebrity has handled this blow differently.\n\nIn recent years, you\u2019ve probably read the articles about celebrities who have decided to give away their thoughts on social media daily, for this promotion or that coveted retweet from Rihanna. My hope for the future, not just for celebrities, but in every young girl I meet\u2026 is that they all realize their worth and ask for a celebrity op-ed. Editors will be confused and say, \u201cBut you\u2019re not a celebrity! you\u2019re just a girl!\u201d But deep down she will know that her words matter just as much as Taylor Swift\u2019s, James Franco\u2019s, Sean Penn\u2019s, Tyra Banks\u2019 or Bono\u2019s.\n\nCelebrity op-eds are art, and art is important and rare. Important, rare things are valuable. Valuable things should be taken as the gospel. It\u2019s my opinion that celebrity op-eds should be read widely, and my prediction is that they will be so long as we keep foisting them upon starstruck editors who can\u2019t say no. I hope the editors don\u2019t underestimate celebrity writers, or undervalue the stink these stars could raise if they treated them like a Normal when editing their celebrity op-eds.\n\nArrows Through The Heart\n\nIn mentioning web traffic, I\u2019d like to point out that people are still reading celebrity op-eds, but now they\u2019re also linking to them on their social media platforms. They are linking only the ones that hit them like an arrow through the heart or have made them feel strong or allowed them to feel like they really aren\u2019t alone in feeling so annoyed with whatever the annoying thing on the Internet is at that moment. It isn\u2019t as easy today as it was 20 years ago to write a celebrity op-ed that dominates the news cycle, what with all the social content celebrities create on a daily basis, and that should challenge and motivate all celebrities.\n\nThere are always going to be those celebrity op-eds that break through on an emotional level and end up reblogged on people\u2019s Tumblrs for the next week. The way I see it, fans view celebrity op-eds the way they view their relationships. Some are just for fun, a passing fling (the ones they read on their phones while waiting for their perpetually late friend to show up, that they will forget were ever published after Shia LaBeouf fatigue sets in). Some celebrity op-eds represent seasons of our lives, like relationships that we hold dear in our memories but had their time and place in the past. Jodie Foster understood that when she wrote about Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson\u2019s breakup.\n\nHowever, some celebrity op-eds will be like finding \u201cthe one.\u201d We will cherish every word their assistants slave over until the next celebrity op-ed about fame\u2019s challenges surfaces. This is the dream bond celebrities hope to establish with their readers. I think the future still holds the possibility for this kind of bond, the one I felt when I read Angelina Jolie\u2019s heartfelt medical confession earlier this year.\n\nI think forming a bond with readers in the future will come in the form of constantly providing them with celebrity op-eds on everything. No, I did not say \u201ccelebrity opinions\u201d (we already have those on Twitter); I said \u201ccelebrity op-eds.\u201d I believe couples can stay in love for decades if they just continue to write each other poorly penned letters and passive-aggressive notes, so why can\u2019t this love affair exist between celebrities and their fans?\n\nIn the overshare generation we live in, we tweet every night of our lives knowing that our ephemeral thoughts have already been articulated better by someone else. To continue to show readers something they have never seen before, I suggest we replace all professional writers with celebrity columnists wishing to shine a spotlight on every thought that enters their minds. My generation was raised being able to watch celebrities on every channel if we got bored, and we read all their mundane thoughts on social media. We want to be caught off-guard, delighted, left in awe. I hope the next generation\u2019s celebrity op-ed columnists will continue to think of inventive ways of keeping their readers on their toes, as challenging as that might be.\n\nThere are a few things I have witnessed becoming obsolete in the past few years, the first being a filter. Celebrities haven\u2019t been asked to express their \u201cexpert\u201d opinions enough since the invention of the iPhone. The only memento \u201ckids these days\u201d want is a selfie on Instagram or celebrity Twitter beef. It\u2019s part of the new currency, which seems to be \u201chow many followers you have on Instagram,\u201d not \u201chow many war-torn countries you\u2019ve been to that you can write about.\u201d\n\nFan Power\n\nA friend of mine, who is an opinion editor at a major newspaper, told me that when the assigning for a recent section came down to two writers, the editor chose the writer who was a celebrity. I see this becoming a trend in journalism. For me, this is a victory that would not have been achieved without James Franco\u2019s tireless efforts to establish himself as a legitimate writer. In the future, writers will get assignments because they have millions of fans \u2014 not because they are good writers.\n\nAnother theme I see fading into the gray is true expertise. These days, nothing you read on the Internet seems to come from someone who actually knows what they\u2019re talking about. The wild, unpredictable fun in professional writing today is that anything goes. The New York Times sounds like a tenth-grade textbook, and Vox sounds like the set of questions at the end of each chapter; Complex sounds like Rush Limbaugh with a fetish for booty, Air Jordans, and A$AP crew; Vice sounds like Hipster Runoff; Salon sounds drunk; every headline and promotional tweet sounds like Upworthy \u2014 and to me, that\u2019s incredible progress. I want to see celebrity op-eds that reflects all of these writing styles, and I think that in the coming decades the idea of knowing what you\u2019re writing about will become less important as celebrity columnists replace all professional writers.\n\nThis moment in publishing is so exciting because the creative avenues a celebrity can explore are limitless. In this moment in journalism, the power of personal branding is not only accepted\u2026 it is celebrated above all. The only real risk is being too afraid to take a risk at all.\n\nCelebrity Spotlight\n\nI predict that some things will never change. There will always be an increasing fixation on the private lives of celebrity columnists, especially the younger ones. Celebrity op-ed writers who wrote back in the \u201970s, \u201980s and \u201990s tell me, \u201cIt was never this crazy for us back then!\u201d And I suspect we\u2019ll be saying that same thing to younger celebrity columnists someday (God help them). There continues to be a professional writer vs. celebrity columnist debate, and for as long as those labels exist, I just hope there will be more celebrities brave enough to speak out in op-eds. All famous people need somewhere to write, even Eva Longoria defending her new Lifetime show or Suzanne Somers peddling factual inaccuracies regarding Obamacare.\n\nAnd as for me? I\u2019ll just be sitting back and growing old, watching all of this happen or not happen, all the while trying to maintain a life as a professional writer without being replaced by celebrity columnists who don\u2019t need the money.\n\nAnd I\u2019d also like a nice garden.", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Where will you be in 20 seconds, 30 seconds, 50 seconds?
