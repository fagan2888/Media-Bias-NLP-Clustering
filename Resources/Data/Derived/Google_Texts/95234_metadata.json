The hospital does not comply with the Medicare/Medicaid Conditions of Participation.\u201d\n\nThe notice caused alarm for many in the community who depend on Medicare or Medicaid for health care and prompted questions of where they would have to go to get medical care.\n\nThe notice does not mean Hopkins County Memorial Hospital is being closed by this agency or any other agency.\n\nIn response to the published notice, HCMH Chief Executive Officer Michael McAndrew issued a brief statement this morning in which he said he believes the matter can be resolved.\n\n\u201cAs CEO of the hospital, I was very surprised at the notice of termination. Our hospital staff and physicians work hard to provide high quality patient-centered care,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will work diligently to resolve the issues identified during the recent CMS survey.\u201d\n\nHopkins County Memorial Hospital released a statement Friday afternoon regarding the notice.\n\n\u201cThursday, the hospital received notice via email that it has been terminated from the Medicare/Medicaid program effective Nov. 6, 2015. We have a meeting scheduled with CMS officials on Tuesday, Oct. 27, at 1 p.m. We hope to get the matter resolved at that meeting. If we are unable to do so at that time, we will officially begin an appeal process. We intend to be transparent about this. We realize the gravity of the situation and have done and will do whatever it takes to address the findings. As we learn more, we will disseminate the information via all media outlets.\u201d\n\nThe Board of Directors of Hopkins County Memorial Hospital District has scheduled a meeting for 6 p.m. Tuesday during which they will meet with representatives from Health and Human Services about the notice.\n\nMcAndrew and board members said if the hospital is unable to resolve the issues, an official appeal process would be started.\n\nSuch a notice does beg questions as to what life-threatening issues were uncovered in an inspection of the county's only medical facility.\n\nCalls to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services [CMS] offices in Dallas Friday afternoon were answered by voice mail, so there was no one answering phones there to shed any light on the hospital's \u201cfailure to meet the minimum health and safety standards.\u201d\n\nAfter asking assistance from Congressman John Ratcliffe's office, the News-Telegram was able to talk to a media representative in that Dallas office and asked for specific information about the \u201cminimum health and safety standards\u201d cited in the notice to terminate Medicare and Medicaid agreements.\n\nBy press deadline today, a request to CMS for the inspection information leading to the termination notice had not been answered.", "article_metadata": {"description": "mySSnews.com is the official online presence for the Sulphur Springs News-Telegram, the daily newspaper for Sulphur Springs, Texas and Hopkins County.", "generator": "Joomla! 1.5 - Open Source Content Management", "author": "Kerry Craig", "title": "Hospital official believes issues can be resolved", "robots": "index, follow", "keywords": "notice, hospital, health, county, memorial, medicare, medicare/medicaid, medicaid, services, termination, hopkins, does, issues, human, cms, meeting, information, published, safety, friday"}, "article_summary": "The notice does not mean Hopkins County Memorial Hospital is being closed by this agency or any other agency.\n\u201cWe will work diligently to resolve the issues identified during the recent CMS survey.\u201dHopkins County Memorial Hospital released a statement Friday afternoon regarding the notice.\nBy press deadline today, a request to CMS for the inspection information leading to the termination notice had not been answered.\nMcAndrew and board members said if the hospital is unable to resolve the issues, an official appeal process would be started.\n\u201cThursday, the hospital received notice via email that it has been terminated from the Medicare/Medicaid program effective Nov. 6, 2015."}
