But she doesn\u2019t love the thought of what that blaring dance music is doing to her ears.\n\n\u201cThere are times when it\u2019s overly loud,\u201d she said. In her hourlong class, the instructor wears a microphone and screams over the music. To avoid getting blasted, Lee stands far from the speakers.\n\nFitness instructors have long used music to motivate their classes, but with the growing popularity of high-intensity workouts, some gym-goers are noticing that their gyms are getting louder. It\u2019s not just music. Functional movement workouts like CrossFit that involve tires flipping, large weights crashing and heavy ropes pounding the floor can produce explosive sounds with intense vibrations.\n\nThe chorus of voices calling for an end to deafening sounds at the gym includes audiologists, health professionals who treat those with hearing loss. They warn that regular exposure to excessive noise can lead to tinnitus (ringing in the ears) or even a loss of hearing.\n\nCycling classes and other full-throttled sessions are louder than they were a decade ago, according to a study last year by Australian researchers.\n\nThat\u2019s not exactly music to Deanna Meinke\u2019s ears.\n\nsketch of Woman on stationary training bicycle\n\nShe\u2019s an audiology professor at the University of Northern Colorado and the co-director of Dangerous Decibels, a public health initiative to raise awareness about how to prevent noise-induced hearing loss.\n\n\u201cPeople are going there because they care about their health, yet this particular activity is harmful if they listen to too-loud music and for too long,\u201d she said.\n\nGenerally, adults can tolerate sounds of 85 decibels \u2014 equivalent to the sound of a busy street corner \u2014 for up to eight hours.\n\n\u201cAnything louder than that and our human ear\u2019s tolerance rate goes way down,\u201d Meinke said.\n\nA normal conversation registers about 65 decibels.\n\nPumped up workouts\n\nIn the high-energy fitness world, music plays a vital role in pumping people up.\n\n\u201cIn terms of a gym, we\u2019re talking about something that motivates people and distracts you from the agony that you might be feeling,\u201d Meinke said. \u201cIt\u2019s been discovered as a useful tool. The trick is to balance that. How do you get people motivated without blasting it?\u201d\n\nHearing damage occurs when the cells inside the ear die from sustained exposure to excessive noise.\n\nThe inner ear has tens of thousands of fragile hair cells that move and respond to every sound we hear, Meinke explained. \u201cIf the sound is too loud and too long, it can break the tiny filaments that hold them together,\u201d she said. \u201cIt can cause the hair cell to break open and die.\u201d\n\nOnce a hair cell dies, it\u2019s gone for good, and the ear doesn\u2019t regenerate new ones.\n\nAt the Firm, a Minneapolis gym known for its club-like atmosphere and demanding workouts, the spin classes are popular and the bass is jumping. Kelly Miyamoto, who co-founded the gym in the \u201980s when aerobics classes were popular, said no one knew back then about the health hazards of a noisy workout.\n\n\u201cPeople now are much more savvy about what they do,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve all discussed it in the industry and the younger people seem to be much more aware of it. They have access to knowledge and information at their fingertips. We didn\u2019t have that.\u201d\n\nThere are now smartphone apps that measure sound in decibels, making it possible for any gym-goer to record the noise level.\n\nIn a recent Cycle class at the Firm, Miyamoto led a full house of spin enthusiasts in an hourlong sweat session. They stayed up out of their seats, pedaling madly, towels draped over their handlebars. \u201cUp, up, up,\u201d Miyamoto sang, cheering them on. Sound levels reached as high as 96 decibels \u2014 or about the sound of an average subway or food blender, according to a decibel-meter app used to gauge the sound.\n\nAlthough the Firm sells earplugs, only three people in the class wore them.\n\nKelly Miyamoto lead an hour-long, and very loud, spin class at The Firm.\n\nMiyamoto said she had her ears checked a few years ago and she did not have any hearing loss. Still, she ordered custom-made earplugs \u2014 the kind that professional musicians wear while performing. \u201cYou hear the sound like it is and it has that extra layer of protection,\u201d she said.\n\nFinding a balance\n\nLife Time Fitness offers earplugs, too. The Chanhassen-based national fitness chain also has a policy on acceptable noise levels.\n\nThe policy calls for a 90-decibel limit, in compliance with the regulations set by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, said Amy Henderson, a Life Time spokeswoman. In addition, the club hired an outside agent last year to perform surprise tests on the noise levels. She said the findings showed that Life Time\u2019s cycling classes registered 63 decibels, on average.\n\n\u201cThat is what we set as a safe standard for our clubs,\u201d she said.\n\nFor many instructors, music is an essential element of an effective workout.\n\nKirk Johnson is group fitness music manager for Life Time, where he also teaches cycling, total conditioning and yoga. He\u2019s also a drummer for Prince.\n\nIn his role as music manager for the fitness club, Johnson comes up with playlists for other instructors, making sure the beat is in sync with the steps in the workout. The playlists are a powerful tool, he said. \u201cBecause you\u2019re going there, it\u2019s a 5:30 a.m. class and you\u2019re waking up. But if the music is driving and the instructor is energetic, that\u2019s going to get you up and your heart rate will be elevated.\u201d\n\nThe Firm sells ear plugs at the front counter for $2.50 for patrons sensitive to loud music.\n\nAt the same time, he said, he recognizes that there can be too much of a good thing.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t have the music so overpowering that you can\u2019t talk over it. You have to be smart as an instructor and gauge that. You\u2019ll have those who love loud music because that\u2019s the drive. So you really have to find that medium.\u201d\n\nEven for him, sometimes it gets too loud. That\u2019s why he, too, has taken to wearing custom-made earplugs.\n\n\u201cI wish I would\u2019ve had those early on,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause we want to be able to hear the birds as we get older.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "Justine Lee of St.", "title": "Now hear this (if you still can after that loud workout music)", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/now-hear-this-if-you-still-can-after-being-blasted-by-loud-workout-music/352373131/", "image": {"url": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_144806254398426.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "width": 1200, "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_144806254398426.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "twitter": {"description": "Justine Lee of St.", "title": "Now hear this (if you still can after that loud workout music)", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/now-hear-this-if-you-still-can-after-being-blasted-by-loud-workout-music/352373131/", "image": {"src": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_144806254398426.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_144806254398426.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "description": "Justine Lee of St."}, "article_summary": "You\u2019ll have those who love loud music because that\u2019s the drive.\nKirk Johnson is group fitness music manager for Life Time, where he also teaches cycling, total conditioning and yoga.\nVideo (01:07) : Patrons of Minneapolis gym, the Firm, and gym co-founder and spin instructor, Kelly Miyamoto, discuss the impact of loud music on their workouts.\nBut if the music is driving and the instructor is energetic, that\u2019s going to get you up and your heart rate will be elevated.\u201dThe Firm sells ear plugs at the front counter for $2.50 for patrons sensitive to loud music.\nIn a recent Cycle class at the Firm, Miyamoto led a full house of spin enthusiasts in an hourlong sweat session."}
