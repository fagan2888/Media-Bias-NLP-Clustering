Every Monday in June, the schedule reports, will see the release of one or more decisions.\n\nOne of the cases of concern to civil libertarians and constitutionalists involves the Obama administration claiming the authority to search and seize cellphone records without a warrant, despite the protections against such government intrusion provided by the Fourth Amendment.\n\nThe Washington Post published the following summary of the case of U.S. v. Wurie:\n\nIn 2007, the police arrested a Massachusetts man who appeared to be selling crack cocaine from his car. The cops seized his cellphone and noticed that it was receiving calls from \u201cMy House.\u201d They opened the phone to determine the number for \u201cMy House.\u201d That led them to the man\u2019s home, where the police found drugs, cash and guns.\n\nThe defendant was convicted, but on appeal he argued that accessing the information on his cellphone without a warrant violated his Fourth Amendment rights. Earlier this year, the First Circuit Court of Appeals accepted the man\u2019s argument, ruling that the police should have gotten a warrant before accessing any information on the man\u2019s phone.\n\nThe Appeals Court ruling doesn\u2019t sit well with a president who considers the Constitution irrelevant and who is accustomed to the court\u2019s collusion in the federal government\u2019s continuing effort to revoke all civil liberties.\n\nOf specific interest in the Wurie case is the government\u2019s claim that a cellphone is no different from any other items a suspect might be carrying that are subject to search by law enforcement, \u201cincluding notebooks, calendars, and pagers,\u201d the Post points out.\n\nOne of these things is not like the others, however. Today, a cellphone is as much a personal computer as a telephone and most people carry things inside their smartphones that have not been placed within the scope of acceptable searches: \u201cour e-mails, text messages, photographs, browser histories and more,\u201d the Post explains.\n\nShould the Obama administration receive a favorable ruling from the Supreme Court, one that holds that police do not need a specific \u2014 constitutionally qualifying \u2014 warrant to search a suspect\u2019s cellphone, the threat to the Fourth Amendment and individual liberty is incalculable.\n\nFor example, a person arrested on a bench warrant for failing to appear for a hearing would have his entire life subject to search and seizure if he was carrying his smartphone at the time he was taken into police custody. Then, the photos, texts, social media posts, and photos stored on that phone would come under the scrutiny of government and the data could be collected and saved in order to blackmail the citizen turned suspect.\n\nIn light of the broad discretion granted to government and law enforcement by the Supreme Court in the 1979 case of Smith v. Maryland, police (and those to whom the information gleaned from the cellphone was shared) could do whatever they deem \u201creasonable\u201d with regard to the information obtained from the warrantless search of the cellphone.\n\nIn the case of Smith v. Maryland, the court held that \u201ca person has no legitimate expectation of privacy in information he voluntarily turns over to third parties.\u201d\n\nThe court in that case ruled that if someone is talking to another person by way of a medium provided by a third-party (in the Smith case it was a telephone company), both parties must expect that the \u201cintermediary\u201d will have access to the content of the communication.\n\nRegarding the telephone company, the court explained that when a person uses a telephone, he \u201cvoluntarily convey[s] numerical information to the telephone company and \u2018expose[s]\u2019 that information to its equipment in the ordinary course of business.\u201d\n\nNot surprisingly, the Obama administration in its brief filed in the Wurie case references the Smith case. The government says Smith supports its position that there is a reduced expectation of privacy regarding the contents of a cellphone.\n\nThe upshot of Wurie is that it is just another piece of evidence of the president\u2019s pursuit of a country where citizens are nothing but future suspects and where privacy and civil liberties are defined not by the Constitution, but by the federal government.\n\nFrom the NSA and Homeland Security, to the U.S. Postal Service and the IRS, the wall of protection provided by the Fourth Amendment is being demolished and the government given life by the Constitution is now on the verge of patricide.\n\nNotably, the Cato Institute predicts that the Supreme Court will find in favor of the federal government, although insisting \u201cthe justices are extremely wary of pronouncing legal rules that could be rendered obsolete or unworkable as newer technology develops.\u201d\n\nThe last of the cases we will outline concerns one the most fundamental rights protected by the First Amendment \u2014 the right to the free exercise of religion.\n\nTwo cases challenging the contraception mandate of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) avers that the plaintiffs\u2019 religious freedoms are being violated by forcing them to offer free (or heavily subsidized) access to contraceptives, including those that induce abortion.\n\nOne of the individual plaintiffs challenging the Obama administration\u2019s coercive contraceptive statute reveals the real danger to liberty posed by the provision.\n\n\u201cWith this mandate contained in the Affordable Care Act, the government is not only violating our religious beliefs; they are also taking it upon themselves to tell us what the boundaries of those religious beliefs are,\u201d states Father Pavone, national director of Priests for Life. \u201cIt is not up to the government to tell us when our conscience hurts; on the contrary, it's up to us as believers to tell the government.\u201d\n\nThe two cases whose decisions will be handed down are Conestoga Wood Specialties Corp. v. Sebelius and Sebelius v. Hobby Lobby Stores. The legal history of those two cases was provided by The New American late last year:\n\nThe United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has ruled that the Conestoga Wood Specialties Corporation, a Mennonite-owned company, must comply with the Health and Human Services mandate that compels companies to pay for drugs that may cause abortions. The ruling was handed down in a 2-1 decision asserting that the Mennonite faith of the company\u2019s owners may not prohibit the company from complying with the mandate.\n\nAnd:\n\nIn [September 2012], Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., a privately held retail chain, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma, opposing the HHS \u201cpreventive services\u201d mandate, which forces the Christian-owned-and-operated business to provide, without co-pay, the \u201cmorning after pill\u201d and \u201cweek after pill\u201d in their health insurance plan.\n\nPeople of faith now wait to see which side the Supreme Court will support: the side that believes the federal government can impose immoral mandates on the mass of citizens regardless of their religious principles, or the side that believes that the government has no authority to encroach upon one of society\u2019s most sacrosanct rights \u2014 the right to exercise one\u2019s religious faith free from federal dictates.\n\nStrangely, some still argue that when the Supreme Court rules on the constitutionality of a federal act, there remains no recourse and the issue is settled once and for all.\n\nIn light of recent decisions by \u201cconservatives\u201d on the Supreme Court in the ObamaCare case, it is no wonder that many Americans doubt that states have a right to nullify a congressional act in the wake of a Supreme Court decision.\n\nThomas Jefferson had something to say in the matter. In 1804, he wrote that giving the Supreme Court power to declare unconstitutional acts of the legislature or executive \u201cwould make the judiciary a despotic branch.\u201d He noted that \u201cnothing in the Constitution\u201d gives the Supreme Court that right.\n\nIn this Mexican standoff of fundamental liberty, Supreme Court, and federal government, the last man standing is the people acting in their collective political capacity as states.\n\nEven Abraham Lincoln recognized the lack of constitutional authority for the Supreme Court\u2019s assumption of the role of ultimate arbiter of an act\u2019s conformity with the Constitution.\n\nLincoln said that if the Supreme Court were afforded the power to declare whether an act of the federal government was constitutional, \u201cthe people will have ceased to be their own masters, having to that extent resigned their government into the hands of that eminent tribunal.\u201d\n\nRenowned constitutional scholar Von Holtz explained the error in accepting the Supreme Court as the ultimate arbiter of constitutional fidelity. \"Moreover, violations of the Constitution may happen and the injured cannot, whether states or individuals, obtain justice through the court. Where the wrongs suffered are political in origin the remedies must be sought in a political way,\" he wrote.\n\nHe continued, regarding this \u201caristocracy of the robe,\u201d \u201cThat our national government, in any branch of it, is beyond the reach of the people; or has any sort of \u2018supremacy\u2019 except a limited measure of power granted by the supreme people is an error.\u201d\n\nHow can anyone read these statements and honestly conclude that any branch of the federal government is intended to be the surveyor of the boundaries of its own power?\n\nEvery department of the federal government was created by the Constitution \u2014 therefore, by the states \u2014 and has no natural sovereignty. No branch can define its own authority. Such a thought is ridiculous and contrary to any theory of popular sovereignty ever proposed. If courts, Congress, or presidents had such power, it would make them judge, jury, and executioner in every case in which their own act exceeding constitutional authority is at bar.\n\nMonday, June 2, constitutionalists will witness how far the Supreme Court is willing to go in joining the unholy alliance formed to obliterate constitutional protections of fundamental liberty.\n\nJoe A.
