However, almost 75 percent of the dissatisfied respondents believe nursing has changed for the worse, as do 39 percent of satisfied respondents.\n\nRNs cited numerous concerns within their profession that are inhibiting time, including short-staffing, increased peripheral duties and regulatory requirements. RNs said other personnel could do many of their time-consuming required tasks, such as restocking supply areas or looking for equipment. Sixty-seven percent of respondents said such activities negatively affect their bedside time, according to the survey.\n\nRNs also expressed concerns about poor communication among nurses, nursing assistants, doctors and hospital administrators, according to the survey. Forty-eight percent of respondents said they had wasted time due to lack of communication, while 42 percent reported losing time to fatigue.\n\nRespondents also identified their most time-consuming indirect care duties. Fifty-one percent named coordinating patient care--including giving or receiving clinical reports, arranging tests and consulting with clinicians--as their most time-consuming responsibility, but only 25 percent of RNs said care coordination negatively affected time with patients. Twenty-eight percent of respondents said indirect care took up two to three hours of their shifts, while 20 percent said it took three to four hours.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here's the survey (.pdf)\n\n- read the statement\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nAs market worsens for hospital jobs, nurses look elsewhere\n\nFewer patient deaths linked to more four-year nursing degrees\n\nInternationally educated nurses could help meet healthcare demand\n\n24 strategies nurses need for evidence-based care", "article_metadata": {"description": "Although most nurses say they are\u00a0satisfied with their jobs, many believe professional conditions are taking a turn for the worse,\u00a0according to\u00a0a new survey from Jackson Healthcare, Care Logistics and Jackson Nurse Professionals.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Although most nurses say they are\u00a0satisfied with their jobs, many believe professional conditions are taking a turn for the worse,\u00a0according to\u00a0a new survey from Jackson Healthcare, Care Logistics and Jackson Nurse Professionals.", "title": "Nurses say profession changing for worse", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/nurses-say-profession-changing-worse/2014-02-11", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Care Coordination,fatigue,HR & Workforce Management,indirect care,Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,nursing job satisfaction,registered nurses", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "HR & Workforce Management,Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9e1f\"", "article_summary": "However, almost 75 percent of the dissatisfied respondents believe nursing has changed for the worse, as do 39 percent of satisfied respondents.\nRNs also expressed concerns about poor communication among nurses, nursing assistants, doctors and hospital administrators, according to the survey.\nSixty-four percent of the 1,333 hospital-based registered nurses (RNs) consulted for the survey report they were satisfied or very satisfied with their jobs, a small, statistically insignificant decrease from 2012.\nAlthough most nurses say they are satisfied with their jobs, many believe professional conditions are taking a turn for the worse, according to a new survey from Jackson Healthcare, Care Logistics and Jackson Nurse Professionals.\nTo learn more:- here's the survey (.pdf)- read the statementRelated Articles:As market worsens for hospital jobs, nurses look elsewhereFewer patient deaths linked to more four-year nursing degreesInternationally educated nurses could help meet healthcare demand24 strategies nurses need for evidence-based care"}
