Leonardi to consider holding public hearings on all rate proposals filed by insurers offering coverage through the state\u2019s health insurance exchange. ConnectiCare Benefits requested an 11.8 percent increase in its base rates and HealthyCT proposed decreasing its premiums by an average of 8.9 percent. UnitedHealthcare also proposed rates for plans that would be sold on the exchange\u2019s individual market for the first time in 2015.\n\n\u201cGiven the potential impact on consumers of the proposed rate adjustments and the need to ensure a sustainable health insurance exchange that offers affordable plans, ensuring an open hearing process on these filings is critical in my view to allow a full vetting of the concerns of all parties with regard to the contents of the filings,\u201d Veltri wrote to Leonardi.\n\nVeltri requested the hearing under the terms of a 2011 agreement that calls for the insurance commissioner to hold hearings at her request on proposals to raise rates by 15 percent or more.\n\nAnthem\u2019s proposal includes rate changes for 17 plans. While the overall average change is a 12.5 percent increase, five of the plans would have premium hikes above 15 percent under the proposal. The filing covers plans sold on and off the state\u2019s health insurance exchange.\n\nDeputy Insurance Commissioner Anne Melissa Dowling said the department is willing to hold a hearing.\n\nBut she added that the department doesn't believe Veltri\u2019s request meets the spirit of the 2011 agreement, which she said was meant to \u201cafford a hearing opportunity\u201d when the request was to raise the base rate by 15 percent or more.\n\nRegardless of whether the department holds a public hearing, people can submit comments on rate proposals through the insurance department\u2019s website.\n\nBut Veltri said having a public hearing can be more helpful because it allows people to hear answers to their questions.\n\n\u201cThe openness would increase the public\u2019s faith in the process, I think,\u201d she said. \u201cI just think people have a right to know how the process works.\u201d\n\nVeltri said she wasn't singling out Anthem, but that it wasn\u2019t clear from ConnectiCare\u2019s rate filing how individual plans would be affected. The insurance department has requested additional information from the carrier.\n\nDowling noted that the insurance department posts on its website rate filings as well as correspondence between the agency and carriers, and that the public can provide input during the comment period. In addition, she said, insurance companies notify policyholders when they file rate increase requests because Leonardi requested they do so.\n\n\"The lack of complaints from the public relating to its ability to submit comments, and indeed the comments we do receive from the public on various rate filings, clearly indicates that the public is aware of its ability to comment and has not indicated a need for assistance,\" said Dowling, who leads the insurance department's health care efforts.\n\nAnd Dowling said the federal government has identified the department as having an effective process for reviewing rate proposals.\n\nThe 2011 public hearing agreement grew out of negotiations between Leonardi, Veltri, Gov. Dannel P. Malloy\u2019s administration and Democratic lawmakers after Malloy vetoed a 2011 bill that would have made it easier for the healthcare advocate and attorney general to compel public \u201csymposiums\u201d on proposed health insurance rate hikes.\n\nThat followed a longstanding dispute between consumer advocates and the insurance department over the merits of public hearings on proposals to increase premiums.\n\nVeltri said Friday that requesting the hearing is not a criticism of the insurance department, but an endorsement of having a public process.", "article_metadata": {"standout": "http://ctmirror.org/2014/06/06/healthcare-advocate-wants-public-hearing-on-anthem-rate-hike-proposal/", "news_keywords": "Health Care, 2015 exchange plan designs, Access Health CT, Affordable Care Act, Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, connecticare, Connecticut Insurance Department, healthyct, Obamacare, UnitedHealthcare", "original-source": "http://ctmirror.org/2014/06/06/healthcare-advocate-wants-public-hearing-on-anthem-rate-hike-proposal/", "og": {"site_name": "The CT Mirror", "description": "State Healthcare Advocate Victoria Veltri has asked the Connecticut Insurance Department to hold a public hearing on Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield\u2019s proposal to raise premiums for its individual-market health plans by an average of 12.5 percent next year.", "title": "Healthcare advocate wants hearing on Anthem rate request", "url": "http://ctmirror.org/2014/06/06/healthcare-advocate-wants-public-hearing-on-anthem-rate-hike-proposal/", "image": "http://ctmirror.org/files/2014/01/Vicki-Veltri_0-1170x877.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ctmirror", "card": "summary", "creator": "@ariellelb"}, "syndication-source": "http://ctmirror.org/2014/06/06/healthcare-advocate-wants-public-hearing-on-anthem-rate-hike-proposal/", "fb": {"admins": "10103384569292809,7920421,10205310995067193", "app_id": 439136839547306}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc979a\"", "article_summary": "Regardless of whether the department holds a public hearing, people can submit comments on rate proposals through the insurance department\u2019s website.\nIn addition, she said, insurance companies notify policyholders when they file rate increase requests because Leonardi requested they do so.\nBut Veltri said having a public hearing can be more helpful because it allows people to hear answers to their questions.\nVeltri said Friday that requesting the hearing is not a criticism of the insurance department, but an endorsement of having a public process.\nDannel P.
