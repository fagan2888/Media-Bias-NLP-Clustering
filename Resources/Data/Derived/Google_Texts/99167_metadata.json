You start noticing how often politicians dismiss the problems you spend your time thinking about.\n\nThey think pre-K is about nap time, not creating lifelong learners. They think unequal pay isn\u2019t a problem, despite plenty of evidence that families rely on women\u2019s earnings and that they are being shortchanged. And forget about affordable child care, paid family leave or paid sick days. They don\u2019t want to hear any of it.\n\nWell, I am a proud lifelong fighter for so-called \u201cwomen\u2019s issues.\u201d I believe that what\u2019s good for women is good for America.\n\nTake child care. It\u2019s a women\u2019s issue. It\u2019s also an economic issue. You can\u2019t go to work every day if you can't afford a safe place to leave your kids.\n\nPaid family leave is a women's issue. It's also an economic issue. Without it, when you have a baby or someone in your family gets sick, you risk losing pay \u2014 or even your job.\n\nEqual pay is a women's issue. It's also an economic issue. When women aren\u2019t paid fairly, or when they get penalized for having children, they have less money in their pockets \u2014 and their whole family gets shortchanged.\n\nAnd every single one of these \u201cwomen\u2019s\u201d issues is a men's issue too. Men want their kids to get the best possible care. Plenty of dads want to stay home to bond with their new babies. Lots of sons are taking care of aging parents.\n\nAs far as I'm concerned, anything that affects women's lives and futures is a women's issue.\n\nAt a time when a majority of minimum wage workers across America are women, raising the minimum wage is a women's issue.\n\nAt a time when more women than ever are going on to higher education, making college affordable, providing child care for students who are parents and helping people refinance their student debt are women's issues.\n\nProtecting the real gains we\u2019ve made through Social Security and Medicare and the Affordable Care Act, insisting that everyone deserves access to quality, affordable health care \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 women\u2019s issues.\n\nAnd protecting the equal rights of all Americans, no matter what they look like or who they love, is definitely a women's issue.\n\nIt\u2019s a good thing we women aren\u2019t afraid of hard work \u2014 because we have some hard work to do.\n\nThere are people out there with a very different vision for our country. You need only to look at the Republican debates to see what I mean. The GOP\u2019s outlandish front-runner gets a lot of the attention, but the other candidates are basically Donald Trump without the pizzazz \u2014 or the hair.\n\nTheir only real ideas are more tax cuts for the rich \u2014 and defunding Planned Parenthood.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s what they don\u2019t say.\n\nNot a word about equal pay or paid family leave or quality, affordable preschool. No solutions for skyrocketing prescription drug costs. No credible plans to keep growing the economy. None willing to talk seriously about the epidemic of gun violence claiming the lives of too many American kids. None willing to say that Black Lives Matter.\n\nIn other words, the same out-of-touch, out-of-date policies they\u2019ve been hawking for years.\n\nIt\u2019s time for something new.\n\nEverywhere I go, all around the country, parents bring their young daughters up to me. A lot of them want to know: Why haven\u2019t we had a woman president?\n\nIt\u2019s a good question.\n\nI believe I\u2019m the most qualified candidate for president. I want to be elected on the merits, and I believe one of the merits is that I\u2019m a woman.\n\nI know what it\u2019s like to be up all night with a sick kid and a big work deadline the next day and to scramble when the babysitter cancels. I know the occasionally frustrating, often wonderful, deeply rewarding work of caring for an aging parent. I know what it\u2019s like to be underestimated because of my gender \u2014 to be told that being a woman would count against me when I applied to a school or a job I had my heart set on. I\u2019ve spent my whole life fighting for women and families, because I believe they matter to our nation and world \u2014 and because their struggles speak to my heart.\n\nI think it\u2019s time for a president like that.\n\nWomen across our country are working hard and fighting for progress every day. I\u2019m behind them every step of the way. If women stand together and fight together, we can make our country stronger, we can make our country fairer, and we can give our children and grandchildren the brighter futures they deserve.\n\nBe a part of this: Join the official Women for Hillary team today.\n\nMore: Exclusive: Chelsea Clinton on motherhood, her childhood and changing the world", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.newsletter_sponsored": "http://cdn.skim.gs/image/upload/c_fill,h_300,w_300/y4kcefq79lov91ydz6qg", "sailthru.author_slug": "hillary-clinton", "description": "Secretary Hillary Clinton tells SheKnows readers why she's the best candidate for president \u2014 and one of her qualifications is being a woman.", "og": {"site_name": "SheKnows", "description": "Secretary Hillary Clinton tells SheKnows readers why she's the best candidate for president \u2014 and one of her qualifications is being a woman.", "title": "Why it's time for a woman to be president", "url": "http://www.sheknows.com/living/articles/1096791/hillary-clinton-on-women-and-family", "image": "http://cdn.skim.gs/image/upload/c_fill,w_600/y4kcefq79lov91ydz6qg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://cdn.skim.gs/image/upload/c_fill,w_600/y4kcefq79lov91ydz6qg", "description": "Secretary Hillary Clinton tells SheKnows readers why she's the best candidate for president \u2014 and one of her qualifications is being a woman.", "site": "@sheknows", "card": "summary", "title": "Why it's time for a woman to be president"}, "sailthru.date": "Thu, 24 Sep 2015 11:00:00 -0700", "sailthru.image.newsletter_secondary": "http://cdn.skim.gs/image/upload/c_fill,h_135,w_256/y4kcefq79lov91ydz6qg", "robots": "noodp,noydir", "sailthru.title": "Women\u2019s issues are family issues, and family issues are economic issues", "sailthru.image.image": "http://cdn.skim.gs/image/upload/c_fill,h_100,w_100/y4kcefq79lov91ydz6qg", "fb": {"app_id": 105697356132938, "pages": 111589138109}, "sailthru.content_id": "sk-1096791", "sailthru.channel_name": "Living", "sailthru.tags": "expertsamongus,hillaryclinton,politics", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-24T11:00:00-07:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-29T11:16:42-07:00", "author": "Hillary Clinton"}, "sailthru.channel": "living", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn.skim.gs/image/upload/c_fill,h_236,w_425/y4kcefq79lov91ydz6qg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "sailthru.author_name": "Hillary Clinton"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd23bc\"", "article_summary": "As far as I'm concerned, anything that affects women's lives and futures is a women's issue.\nAnd forget about affordable child care, paid family leave or paid sick days.\nPaid family leave is a women's issue.\nAnd protecting the equal rights of all Americans, no matter what they look like or who they love, is definitely a women's issue.\nIt\u2019s a women\u2019s issue."}
