(Mike Segar/Reuters)\n\nTwo stories converge today to illuminate how the White House and the Democratic establishment are attempting to hide the next wave of Obamacare failures. Both Post stories reveal how the president and Democratic leaders at the state level are hiding problems with Obamacare instead of confronting and fixing problems.\n\nFirst, Amy Goldstein of The Post reveals that the appeals process guaranteed in the Obamacare law does not actually exist. The story outlines an almost comical process that requires citizens who seek a fair hearing to have an innocent, HealthCare.gov-generated mistake corrected to fill out a seven-page paper form that is then inexplicably shipped to Kentucky, where it is entered into a government database that isn\u2019t actually connected to anything. It\u2019s a digital dead end for those who dare to complain. Typical. As a result, 22,000 Americans who have submitted an appeals request remain without proper coverage and they have no recourse. And, according to The Post, in the latest show of non-transparency from this administration, officials have \u201cnot made public the fact that the appeals system for the online marketplace is not working.\u201d There is \u201cno indication that infrastructure . . . necessary for conducting informal reviews and fair hearings had even been created, let alone become operational,\u201d and administration officials are refusing to give any information as to when the appeals process might start moving. This is an administration that wants to hide things rather than fix things.\n\nNext, The Post\u2019s Jenna Johnson and Mary Pat Flaherty outline how Maryland state officials are trying to block an investigation into the debacle of the state health insurance exchange Web site, which has been plagued with operational problems since day one. Some Democratic officials \u2014 including Lt. Gov. Anthony G. Brown, who is running for governor \u2014 don\u2019t want a full investigation because such an investigation could have a negative impact on the upcoming state elections for Democrats. Remarkably, and presumably with a straight face, Sen. Thomas Middleton (D-Charles), the chairman of the Finance Committee, reportedly argued that a full investigation would \u201cdistract health officials from signing Marylanders up for health insurance before the March 31 deadline.\u201d Instead, some Maryland Democrats prefer to \u201cdefer to a previously scheduled state audit of the exchange that is expected to begin this summer and could take a year to complete.\u201d This would conveniently push any revelations or accountability (the truth) until after the elections.\n\nIt is painfully obvious that many Democrats think the best political tactics for dealing with the numerous Obamacare problems are to ignore them, hide them or otherwise deny they exist. Democrats just keep insisting that folks are signing up and \u201cglitches\u201d are being fixed.\n\nThese two stories suggest that the Democrats hope Obamacare fatigue will set in and voters will begin to simply shrug as the problems become part of American life, that Obamacare will become another government-supplied annoyance for which no one is responsible and no one is to blame. The problem is that voters can\u2019t just learn to ignore the calamity that is Obamacare because health care and health insurance are vital to the life of every American.\n\nYou can bet President Obama has completely checked out from any Obamacare management, and there is zero chance his staff and Cabinet want to bring problems to his attention or ask for his instructions.\n\nDemocrats may think they can stiff-arm all the inquiries into the problems with Obamacare, but they can\u2019t. The Obamacare blight is here to stay and Democrats own it. The best politics for them would be to do everything they can to make sure the system works. But they can\u2019t make sure Obamacare works if they continue to deny problems exist or hide these problems from the public. It is insulting to voters for the Democrats to shamelessly shift blame, plead ignorance and pretend things are fine. The sooner they realize this, the better off they will be in November. Engaging in denial and deceit isn\u2019t a plan, and they won\u2019t be able to maintain multiple cover-ups for the next nine months. The Democrats can run, but they can\u2019t hide.\n\nFollow Ed on Twitter: @EdRogersDC", "article_metadata": {"description": "Democrats are trying to hide the problems with Obamacare instead of fixing the problems.
