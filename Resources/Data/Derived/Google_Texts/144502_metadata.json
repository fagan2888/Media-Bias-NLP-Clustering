Later that year, Farook married Malik in Saudi Arabia and returned with her to celebrate the union at the Islamic Center in Riverside with a party for an estimated 250 to 300 people.\n\nKuko recalls Farook that night as being \u201cvery much pleased, relaxed, comfortable,\u201d he said. \u201cWe didn't infer anything abnormal.\u201d\n\nNizaam Ali, a 23-year-old student who got to know Farook after he began attending the San Bernardino mosque, recalled Farook\u2019s saying his wife wore the niqab, a veil that covers the entire face except for the eyes, and that he liked that about her.\n\nKuko said he couldn\u2019t recall ever hearing Farook express extreme ideology. \u201cIf he had ever expressed his ideas, we could have tried to stop it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe would have shut it down.\u201d\n\nIn the wake of the shootings, the San Bernardino mosque received a phone threat that prompted an investigation by police, Nadvi said.\n\nFriday\u2019s prayer, known as the Jummah prayer, will be guarded by police between 12:30 p.m. and 2:30 p.m. as an expected 300 people gather to pray.\n\nAt the Riverside mosque, as many as 1,700 people typically show up for Friday prayer. One focus of their thoughts and prayers this week will be for Anies Kondoker, a mosque member who was among those injured in Wednesday\u2019s shooting, Kuko said. She has three children and her husband is the program director.\n\n(Reporting by Yasmeen Abutaleb, writing by Robin Respaut; Editing by Sue Horton and Cynthia Osterman)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "SAN BERNARDINO (Reuters) - California shooter Syed Rizwan Farook was a devout Muslim w", "title": "Leaders of mosques where California shooter prayed say rampage betrayed Islam", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/12/03/Leaders-mosques-where-California-shooter-prayed-say-rampage-betrayed-Islam", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/california-shooting_2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/12/03/Leaders-mosques-where-California-shooter-prayed-say-rampage-betrayed-Islam", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/california-shooting_2.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "SAN BERNARDINO (Reuters) - California shooter Syed Rizwan Farook was a devout Muslim w", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWe would have shut it down.\u201dIn the wake of the shootings, the San Bernardino mosque received a phone threat that prompted an investigation by police, Nadvi said.\nSAN BERNARDINO (Reuters) - California shooter Syed Rizwan Farook was a devout Muslim who made a pilgrimage to Mecca in 2013 and prayed regularly at a mosque in Riverside, California and later at one in nearby San Bernardino, officials at the mosques said on Thursday.\nAt the Riverside mosque, as many as 1,700 people typically show up for Friday prayer.\nMahmood Nadvi, an assistant imam at the Dar Al Uloom Al Islamiyah-Amer mosque in San Bernardino, which Farook began attending in 2014, was equally disturbed.\n\"He is someone who used to listen to my sermons, my talks here,\" said Mustafa Kuko, director of the Islamic Center of Riverside."}
