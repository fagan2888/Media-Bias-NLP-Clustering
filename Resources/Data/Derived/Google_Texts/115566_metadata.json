It set a goal of 1.7 million for this open enrollment.\n\nTwitter: @chadterhune", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "100,000 California households get incorrect Obamacare tax forms", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "California's Obamacare exchange sent erroneous tax forms to about 100,000 households that received federal premium subsidies last year.", "title": "100,000 California households get incorrect Obamacare tax forms", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/business/healthcare/la-fi-obamacare-california-tax-forms-20150213-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-54de6b51/turbine/la-fi-obamacare-california-tax-forms-20150213", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp11.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "obamacare, covered california, 1095, taxes", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373238146, app-argument=http://www.latimes.com/deeplinkid/82811305", "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2015-02-13", "Description": "California's Obamacare exchange sent erroneous tax forms to about 100,000 households that received federal premium subsidies last year.
