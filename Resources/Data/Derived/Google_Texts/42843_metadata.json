Forgotten now (it was years ago, dude) is that our elected representatives have their own health care, and they wish us the best going forward with ours.\n\nHave we lost the \u201cgenius of our system\u201d to which James Madison referred?\n\nMadison\u2019s caution regarding legislators applies just as well to our economic rulers, the Central Bankers.\n\nMadison promised that our elected representatives would not be above us:\n\n\u2026 that they can make no law which will not have its full operation on themselves and their friends, as well as on the great mass of the society.\n\nMadison continues:\n\nThis has always been deemed one of the strongest bonds by which human policy can connect the rulers and the people together. It creates between them that communion of interests and sympathy of sentiments of which few governments have furnished examples; but without which every government degenerates into tyranny.\n\nWhen the Federal Reserve members, governors, presidents, chairpersons promote inflation, they themselves are sheltered from its ill effects. There is no \u201cfull operation\u201d of inflation upon them, nor will there be. They have the pensions, cost-of-living adjustments, and special health care plans. In many instances they have the big six-figure speech calendar after they leave \u201cpublic service.\u201d Others have the private-sector positions that will supplement their government pensions. Nice. Inflation, that which they promote, is of little concern for them who champion the concept.\n\nThis brings us back to Madison\u2019s \u201cpromise.\u201d Though he did not have economics in mind, Madison held to the concept that the effects of the decisions made by our \u201cpublic servants\u201d must have the same impact on \u201cthem\u201d as upon \u201cus.\u201d\n\nBen Bernanke once said he \u201cworried about the retirees\u201d because of the zero interest rate policy. Hats off to Mr. Bernanke for the nanosecond of concern. It must have been a fleeting emotion. We witness Mr. Bernanke\u2019s retirement.\n\nThough Madison warned of politicians \u201cmaking legal discriminations in favor of themselves and a particular class of the society,\u201d there seem to be \u201ceconomic discriminations\u201d being conducted. For our economic \u201crulers,\u201d the Central Bankers, are sheltered from any ill effects from the policies they promote for \u201cus,\u201d just as Congress and others are insulated from any ill effects of the mislabeled Affordable Care Act.
