I think even those people who might not agree with what (state legislators) did or feel it\u2019s getting onto the politically correct aspect of things, the state decided to change its concept of why the flag was put up in the first place.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP Film Writer Lindsey Bahr contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Quentin Tarantino's latest film, \"Hateful Eight,\" takes place a few years after the end of the Civil War - and cast members had the Confederate flag on their minds.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Quentin Tarantino\u2019s latest film, \u201cHateful Eight,\u201d takes place a few years after the end of the Civil War - and cast members had the Confederate flag on their minds.", "title": "Cast of \u2018Hateful Eight\u2019 share thoughts on Confederate flag", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jul/11/cast-of-hateful-eight-share-thoughts-on-confederat/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/07/11/d351c35feb07ee1e7b0f6a70670061f8.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/07/11/d351c35feb07ee1e7b0f6a70670061f8.jpg", "description": "Quentin Tarantino's latest film, \"Hateful Eight,\" takes place a few years after the end of the Civil War - and cast members had the Confederate flag on their minds.", "card": "summary", "title": "Cast of \u2018Hateful Eight\u2019 share thoughts on Confederate flag"}, "Author": "BY RYAN PEARSON", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "SAN DIEGO (AP) - Quentin Tarantino\u2019s latest film, \u201cHateful Eight,\u201d takes place a few years after the end of the Civil War - and cast members had the Confederate flag on their minds.\nRoth and Goggins found the film incredibly timely, even before South Carolina removed the Confederate flag from its state house on Friday.\n\u201cTo be there, and to have witnessed the pain of that city coming off doing this movie, is extraordinary,\u201d he said.\n\u201cFerguson had just happened when we were rehearsing\u2026 it seems very pertinent, oddly enough,\u201d Roth said.\n\u201cSo the state decided that that idea of putting the flag up in response to that was not a great idea after nine people were killed because of the color of their skin."}
