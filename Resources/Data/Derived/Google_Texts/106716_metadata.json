Kay Hagan is confounding the early prognosticators and continues to lead in virtually every independent poll. In Georgia, where Romney had a stronger win two years ago (53% to 45%), Democrats are running neck-and-neck with Republicans in both the governor\u2019s race and the US Senate race.\n\nIn South Carolina, however, which is nestled between the two, the GOP is poised to return Republicans to the governor\u2019s office and two US Senate seats with apparent ease. True, Romney\u2019s lead was stronger here \u2013 55% to 44%. But the GOP\u2019s continued strength is in the face of several important negatives. Gov. Nikki Haley (R) has often been the subject of controversy, including with GOP legislators, and faces state Sen. Vincent Sheheen (D), whom she narrowly defeated (51% to 47%) in 2010. US Sen. Lindsey Graham (R) has angered his party\u2019s rightwing and had to conduct a primary campaign against six challengers (he won with 56%). Moreover, both Haley and Graham face once-Republican independent candidates who have the potential of drawing votes away from the two Republican lawmakers. Only US Sen. Tim Scott (R), a conservative African-American, running for the last four years of an unexpired term, has had smooth sailing.\n\nBut despite these negatives, Palmetto State voters appear ready to reelect Haley and Graham, as well as Scott, and with comfortable margins.\n\nIn the governor\u2019s race, Haley continues to get support from the conservative base for opposition to spending and higher taxes. She benefits more broadly from the state\u2019s job growth. South Carolina\u2019s jobless rate declined over the past year from 8.0% to 5.3%. The 2.7 point decrease was the highest in the South and is indicative of a significant economic turnaround in South Carolina on Haley\u2019s watch.\n\nHaley has been consistently leading in voter surveys. A Winthrop University poll released October 1 showed Haley with a 44% to 33% lead over Sheheen; Ervin had 4%, with 12% undecided. In the four-poll Real Clear Politics (RCP) average, Haley had 51%, Sheheen 36%. The results for independent Tom Ervin, a former judge, were not included.\n\nCharles Waring, editor/publisher of the Charleston Mercury, while acknowledging that Haley is not \u201cbeloved,\u201d says that she \u201cis not making mistakes that make people upset.\u201d\n\nIn addition, Sheheen \u201cis running as a national Democrat,\u201d says a consultant (R) not connected to any campaign, and \u201che\u2019s not closing the deal.\u201d He has criticized Haley for failing to expand Medicaid in the state under Obamacare, but her position is not an unpopular stance in this conservative state. Sheheen \u201ccan\u2019t shake that,\u201d says Waring.\n\nMoreover, Sheheen has not been able to focus effectively on the problems at the Department of Social Services, although he has referenced it in one TV spot. A Legislative Audit Council report found that showed caseworkers were heavily overloaded was placing children \u201cat greater risk.\u201d Haley had chosen the DSS\u2019s director, Lillian Koller, who has since resigned. Sheheen has also hit Haley for vetoing a teacher pay raise, a veto overridden by the Republican legislature.\n\nOn the plus side for Sheheen, former Democratic National Committeeman and Charleston attorney Waring Howe says the Democrats\u2019 internal polls are \u201cvery, very close,\u201d and he notes that in 2010, polls a month out showed Haley with a much larger lead than she got on Election Day. \u201cIf Sheheen wins Charleston big, he can win,\u201d says Howe. Moreover, Bakari Sellers, son of civil rights activist Cleveland Sellers, is the Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor, which should help bring out African-American voters who will also vote for Sheheen.\n\nIndeed, at this point, Sheheen is concentrating on turning out the mostly African-American Democratic base. He is now calling for removal of the Confederate battle flag from the state house grounds. \u201cThirty days out and you\u2019re still trying to rally your base? I don\u2019t see it appealing to moderates and independents,\u201d says the consultant. Note also that when Vice President Joe Biden visited Columbia last week, the rally was held at historically black Allen University.\n\nAs for Ervin taking Republican or independent votes away from Haley, it isn\u2019t happening. \u201cIf Democrats were counting on Ervin to do their dirty work, it didn\u2019t work,\u201d says the consultant (R). Ervin spent about $2 million around Labor Day, says this source, but it didn\u2019t help him. As noted above, he received 4% in the recent Winthrop survey.\n\nIn the US Senate race, Graham\u2019s meticulously planned, well-organized and well-planned campaign, which began to take shape in 2013 before the filing deadline, is paying off. Moreover, he gets lots of free media in television interviews, particularly on foreign affairs, affirming his image in the state as a major player in Washington, which helps him with the state\u2019s business and civic establishment.\n\nIn Winthrop University\u2019s poll released October 1, Graham led with 46% to Hutto\u2019s 28%, with 8% for Ravenel. And in the RCP average of four polls taken from July through October 1, Graham had 46%, Hutto 30%.\n\nIn the money chase, through the first half of this year, Graham easily came in first, raising $6,521,000. Democrat Hutto raised $177,000. Independent Ravenel brought in $235,000 \u2013 all of it lent the campaign by Ravenel. And Libertarian Kocher raised $4,000.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no house-a-fire for Graham,\u201d says Waring, noting that in no poll does his approval rating exceed the mid-40s. As for the prospect of Ravenel hurting the GOP nominee, his campaign \u201cis imploding. He\u2019s not spending the money that people thought he would.\u201d Waring attributes Graham\u2019s very likely reelection to Obama\u2019s unpopularity (38% in the Winthrop Poll) and to the weakness of his opponents. (A GOP insider comments that Ravenel\u2019s \u201cdislike for Graham is visceral.\u201d Democrat Howe says Ravenel has \u201creal personal animosity toward Graham.\u201d)\n\nHowe says, \u201cI don\u2019t think the Thomas Ravenel campaign is getting any traction,\u201d citing Ravenel\u2019s personal life, which includes a stint in prison on drug-related charges. Ravenel also appears on Bravo\u2019s Southern Charm, in which \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of drinking and risqu\u00e9 behavior. As a result, people don\u2019t take him seriously,\u201d Howe adds. Moreover, Ravenel, who \u201cmade a pile of money in real estate development,\u201d is not spending as much money on his campaign as folks had originally thought he would. As for Hutto, Howe says he \u201cwould have been competitive, but he needed $2 million, not $200,000.\u201d\n\nIn the race for the remaining four years in the state\u2019s other US Senate seat, incumbent Scott is a shoo-in. In the recent Winthrop Poll, Scott had 52% to Dickerson\u2019s 32%, with 2% for Jill Bossi\u2019s 2%, running as the nominee of the fiscally conservative, socially liberal American Party. In fundraising, Scott has done almost as well as Graham, raising $5,258,000. Democrat Dickerson raised $37,000, and Bossi $11,000.", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2d87\"", "article_summary": "Only US Sen.
