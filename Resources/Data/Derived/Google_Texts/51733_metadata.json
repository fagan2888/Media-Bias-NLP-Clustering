One reason cited is that more people are going to private providers because more providers are accepting Medicaid under the federal Affordable Care Act.\n\nAs an example, the department has seen reimbursed fees dropped from $28.5 million in Fiscal Year 2009 to $19 million in Fiscal Year 2014.\n\nCurrier gave the department\u2019s budget request for the next budget year, which begins July 1, 2016, during the Joint Legislative Budget Committee hearing this week.\n\nLt. Gov. Tate Reeves said the Legislature has provided the health department about $10 million more from the general fund over the last four years, leading him to surmise that the Legislature isn\u2019t likely to go along with the request for an $18.5 million deficit appropriation.\n\nCurrier said the department has seen a decrease in almost all services, including in vaccinations.\n\nThe deficit is due to a $10 million cash transfer from the health department to the state\u2019s rainy day fund in 2010, a one-third decrease in Medicaid reimbursement from 2012-2014, and a $5 million deficit due to the closing of home health care from 2007-2014. Also, Currier said the state\u2019s new accounting software system contributed to the department inability to determine its cash balances this fiscal year.\n\nCurrier said there is no projected improvement in the funding stream for the current budget year, which began July 1.\n\n\u201cTherefore, the Mississippi Department of Health must address all operations, services, staffing and other expenditures to live within the current appropriations into the future,\u201d Currier said.\n\nCurrier said some department fees haven\u2019t been raised since the late 1990s and no longer cover the costs of the service provided.\n\nThe state Legislature mostly determine the fees that the department can charge. Currier is requesting that the department be allowed to set fees with oversight from the Legislature, the Legislature watchdog group PEER, or the state auditor to make sure fees only cover the cost of providing program services.\n\nAlso, Currier is asking that the department be allowed to come from under state Personnel Board rules for the next two years.\n\nHowever, state Sen. Willie Simmons, D-Cleveland, said he isn\u2019t generally in favor of state agencies coming from under state Personal Board rules and regulations. The department is looking at decreasing local clinic capacity and staffing to better match available resources.\n\nContact Jimmie E. Gates at (601) 961-7212 or jgates@jackson.gannett.com.
