And They’re Off: Hillary Clinton’s announcement of her presidential campaign, as predictable and low-key as one of her signature pantsuits, nonetheless generated enough buzz and media attention to drown out any hullaballoo Sen. Marco Rubio hoped for with his glitzier 2016 launch in Miami. But neither Rubio nor Clinton got as big a media bounce as Ted Cruz when he became the first official presidential candidate for the 2016 cycle. That’s the conclusion, U.S. News’ Dave Catanese reports, of a Republican consulting firm and a media story-tracking platform which measured the media impact of the first four White House campaign announcements. The Gage Group found that, somewhat unsurprisingly, Clinton’s cannonball dive into the presidential pool made the biggest splash but Cruz had the most impact within his party. Compared to those two, Rand Paul did a virtual belly-flop: He got little media traction, what he got quickly turned negative – just ask NBC News reporter Savannah Guthrie – and he hasn’t quite rebounded yet.
