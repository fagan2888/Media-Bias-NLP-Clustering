Bill Haslam make a \"health care announcement\" in the Old Supreme Court chambers in the Tennessee State Capitol April12, 2016 in Nashville, Tenn. (Photo: Samuel M. Simpkins / The Tennessean)Buy Photo\n\nUnderwhelming is the kindest way to describe the response to Speaker Beth Harwell\u2019s \u201c3-Star Healthy Project,\u201d a task force to prepare alternatives to Gov. Bill Haslam\u2019s Insure Tennessee plan, which she announced Tuesday.\n\nWhen Insure Tennessee failed to garner any support in the legislature last year, Harwell said, she began looking for alternatives.\n\nAfter a series of informal meetings with \u201cexperts in health policy at Vanderbilt University\u2019s School of Medicine\u201d got her fellow house members excited about some of the ideas discussed, Harwell decided a task force was needed to \u201cdelve into these ideas and formulate a specific proposal.\u201d\n\nHarwell, R-Nashville, announced the project with Haslam at her side, and said that a group of four house Republicans would have proposals ready in June for a meeting with the governor and federal officials from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n\nHarwell hopes that her task force can accomplish in two months what Haslam could not do in nearly two years of negotiating with CMS, devise a way to expand access to health care for Tennessee\u2019s working poor (Insure Tennessee hoped to cover 280,000 or so Tennesseans) without using state money or money from the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare).\n\nThe task force was announced, but no potential alternative solutions were offered at the press conference.\n\nSkeptics\n\nHer proposal immediately drew derision from Democrats and supporters of the Insure Tennessee plan.\n\n\u201cTennesseans waited two years while Governor Haslam negotiated a plan with the federal government. Then the House never even got a chance to vote on it,\u201d said Rep. Jim Cooper, D-5th, in a statement. \u201cNow we have to wait at least another year? Cancer patients don\u2019t have that kind of time.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe so-called '3-Star' proposal unveiled today deserves a rating of 'two thumbs down' from Tennessee families,\u201d said Rep. John Ray Clemmons, D-Nashville. \u201cHow embarrassing it must have been for the governor to stand there and watch his signature piece of legislative policy be reduced to nothing before his own eyes.\u201d\n\nAndy Spears, executive director of Tennessee Citizen Action, a group supporting the governor\u2019s plan, wrote in a blog post: \u201cToday, some expected that Harwell would finally support Governor Haslam\u2019s plan and call on her body\u2019s members to debate the legislation and take a vote.\n\n\u201cInstead, she announced she\u2019s forming a task force \u2026\"\n\nPolitics\n\nAfter Harwell\u2019s press conference, Haslam said, \u201cWe've always been about finding an answer. Insure Tennessee obviously didn't get the votes that were needed.\u201d\n\nThe governor has repeatedly said that his plan could only move forward when, and if, \u201csomething changed,\u201d meaning the electoral politics for Republicans over Obamacare. He added, \u201cYou're always trying to find the answer that works best.\"\n\nHarwell appointed Rep. Cameron Sexton, R-Crossville, chairman of the House Health Committee, to lead the task force. Joining Sexton will be representatives Matthew Hill, R- Jonesborough, Steve McManus, R-Cordova, and Roger Kane, R-Knoxville.\n\n\"I was probably one of the most vocal opponents to Insure Tennessee because there were just no controls implemented, and so it was not fiscally conservative,\" Kane said. \"It's kind-hearted, but not fiscally conservative.\"\n\nNashville radio host Ralph Bristol, 99.7 WTN, asked Hill whether Harwell had specified whether the proposed solutions could be funded with Medicaid expansion funds.\n\n\u201cThat remains to be seen,\u201d Hill said.\n\n\u201cWe are charged with finding fiscally conservative solutions that are manageable, that are measurable, and, ultimately, that increase access to care. Those were the only charges we were given.\u201d\n\nOne alternative\n\nAt least one alternative proposal has met with approval, but was not mentioned by Harwell or the task force members.\n\nSen. Mark Green, R-Clarksville, urged the task force to consider his TennCare opt-out pilot program, which passed the House Insurance and Banking committee on March 29. The proposed program would establish health savings accounts and issue electronic banking cards to enrollees, who would be able to decide when and where to get health care and be able to keep any saved funds.\n\nReach Frank Daniels III: fdanielsiii@tennessean.com, 615-881-7039, or on Twitter @fdanielsiii\n\nRead or Share this story: http://tnne.ws/1N9Aynq", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Faced with criticism over Insure Tennessee, Speaker Beth Harwell forms a task force to explore health insurance options.", "og": {"site_name": "The Tennessean", "description": "Faced with criticism over Insure Tennessee, Speaker Beth Harwell forms a task force to explore health insurance options.", "title": "Does Harwell's task force have impossible mission?", "url": "http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/2016/04/13/does-harwells-task-force-have-impossible-mission/82982890/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/tennessean.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Faced with criticism over Insure Tennessee, Speaker Beth Harwell forms a task force to explore health insurance options.", "creator": "@tennessean", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/cdcb046d5aa0f8540d0f686d2e929a9bc47341c2/c=0-0-2737-2737&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/04/12/Nashville/Nashville/635960727920016730-NAS-Harwell-Haslam-01.jpg", "title": "Does Harwell's task force have impossible mission?", "site": "@tennessean", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600028886", "fb": {"app_id": 121487414583460}, "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Topics/Insure Tennessee", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Topics/Insure Tennessee", "title": "Does Harwell's task force have impossible mission?", "author": "Frank Daniels III", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/17fc85dbe25203bbc8de7efb74129cbfe2068dc3/c=528-0-2581-2737/local/-/media/2016/04/12/Nashville/Nashville/635960727920016730-NAS-Harwell-Haslam-01.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4b9e57129cb91f9631ea38463c3cc7644c4ba2c9/c=0-0-2737-2737/local/-/media/2016/04/12/Nashville/Nashville/635960727920016730-NAS-Harwell-Haslam-01.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7f0968de581ba9f79cc4f97bc8cd04b27674dcae/c=273-0-3913-2737/local/-/media/2016/04/12/Nashville/Nashville/635960727920016730-NAS-Harwell-Haslam-01.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7001f70fc5ffb32d30097180a127ea24b5991dc6/c=0-281-4185-2645&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2016/04/12/Nashville/Nashville/635960727920016730-NAS-Harwell-Haslam-01.jpg", "publishtime": "2016-04-13T22:02:18.057000-05:00", "shorthed": "Does Harwell's task force have impossible mission?", "articleid": 82982890, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/5f4329895be210e043d7a44b65a9491bc9885630/c=0-281-4185-2645/local/-/media/2016/04/12/Nashville/Nashville/635960727920016730-NAS-Harwell-Haslam-01.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/428ed9ba4b1903ba87b6a6ab3c58c70066e7ee13/c=841-0-2374-2737/local/-/media/2016/04/12/Nashville/Nashville/635960727920016730-NAS-Harwell-Haslam-01.jpg"}}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "Beth Harwell, Tennessee legislature, Insure Tennessee"}, "article_summary": "The task force was announced, but no potential alternative solutions were offered at the press conference.\n\u201cInstead, she announced she\u2019s forming a task force \u2026\"PoliticsAfter Harwell\u2019s press conference, Haslam said, \u201cWe've always been about finding an answer.\nHarwell appointed Rep.
