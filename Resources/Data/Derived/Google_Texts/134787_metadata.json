The new building includes a large lecture hall and several labs with simulated patients: $50,000 mannequins that can breathe, eat, urinate and give birth.\n\nGateWay Community College just finished its nursing-building renovation, and work at Phoenix College is scheduled to be completed next spring.\n\nThe projects are part of the $951 million construction bond approved by voters in 2004 to update and enlarge Maricopa Community Colleges facilities.\n\nMeeting a growing need\n\nTraining more nurses is important because the population is aging and the Affordable Care Act will make millions more Americans eligible for health-care coverage. Currently, there are not enough nurses to accommodate them.\n\nArizona is predicted to have one of the most severe nursing shortages by 2030, according to an analysis published in the American Journal of Medical Quality in 2012.\n\nToward that end, the community colleges started a program two years ago to speed up degree completion.\n\nStudents who are accepted into the nursing program now have the option of enrolling concurrently with a university, which allows them to earn their Bachelor of Science degree in nursing at the end of four or five semesters, Schultz said.\n\nThe program started with about 40 students, but this year, about 500 of the community colleges\u2019 2,000 nursing students are enrolled with either Northern Arizona University, Arizona State University or the University of Phoenix. The program provides a path to a bachelor\u2019s degree that\u2019s faster and cheaper than a traditional, four-year university course of study.\n\n\u201cThe program is really gaining momentum now, and we\u2019re also talking to other universities to provide more opportunities to our students,\u201d Schultz said. \u201cWe are doing more outreach to high schools and trying to reach students early so we can prepare them for this pathway.\u201d\n\nIn the program, nursing students take the four semesters at the community college while simultaneously taking online courses from a university. They must have a 3.0 grade-point average to qualify.\n\nIntense workload\n\nSchultz said that the programs, while difficult, are aligned so that the workload is humane, with some university work done during community-college breaks. She added that the ASU program requires a fifth semester.\n\nThe first participants graduated in May, with degrees from the community colleges and NAU.\n\nNext spring will see the first graduates with concurrent associate degrees from the community colleges and bachelor\u2019s degrees from ASU or the University of Phoenix.\n\nThe program is intense.\n\nErin Cava, 31, of Chandler, will graduate in May with degrees from Scottsdale Community College and NAU after two years of study, including summers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot of work. I have a big calendar that has all my due dates on it,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd my husband helps me a lot with the kids, and I just do it.\u201d\n\nSupport from instructors is key.\n\n\u201cI can text or call and say, \u2018I\u2019m having a hard time,\u2019 and they\u2019re available to help us. It makes all the difference in the world,\u201d said Cava, a former 911 dispatcher who would like to be an emergency-room nurse.\n\nSchultz said students who choose not to enroll concurrently will graduate with an associate degree in applied science in nursing and can sit for the national exam to become a registered nurse. They can pursue a bachelor\u2019s degree later, she said.", "article_metadata": {"byline": "Mary Beth Faller", "description": "Community colleges grow, streamline nursing major,The Maricopa Community Colleges have made changes in the past few years to ease the wait for students who want to enroll in their popular nursing programs and to provide a faster path to a career.", "pubdate": "Sun Oct 20, 2013  9:36 PM", "creditline": "The Republic | azcentral.com", "headline": "Community colleges grow, streamline nursing major", "section": "Community", "og": {"url": "http://azc.cc/A2dj9", "site_name": "azcentral.com", "image": "http://i.azcentral.com/i/6/f/9/L169_CIFR437a64397a104544a565880c027309f6.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Community colleges grow, streamline nursing major"}, "fb": {"admins": 732445551, "app_id": 115142145268769}, "keywords": "Community colleges grow, streamline nursing major, Arizona, News", "twitter": {"description": "The Maricopa Community Colleges have made changes in the past few years to ease the wait for students who want to enroll in their popular nursing programs and to provide a faster path to a career.", "title": "Community colleges grow, streamline nursing major", "url": "http://www.azcentral.com/community/scottsdale/articles/20131015community-college-nursing-programs.html", "image": "http://www.azcentral.com/imgs/azc_fb_logo.jpg", "site": "@azcentral", "card": "summary", "account_id": 13115682}}, "article_summary": "The projects are part of the $951 million construction bond approved by voters in 2004 to update and enlarge Maricopa Community Colleges facilities.\nGateWay Community College just finished its nursing-building renovation, and work at Phoenix College is scheduled to be completed next spring.\nScottsdale Community College will hold a dedication of its newly renovated Health Sciences building, which houses the school\u2019s nursing program, at 4 p.m. Oct. 29.\nThe first participants graduated in May, with degrees from the community colleges and NAU.\nThe approximately 1,200 people on the waiting list can expect to wait about three semesters for admission to the nursing major at one of the eight community colleges that offer it, according to Margi Schultz, director of nursing for the colleges."}
