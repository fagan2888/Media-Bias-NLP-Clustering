She estimated that less than 3 percent of the Smith clinic\u2019s clients will be helped by the Affordable Care Act. \u201cMany people,\u201d she said, \u201care under the mistaken impression that the ACA will provide insurance for all. The truth is that since South Carolina is one of 26 states that have elected not to expand Medicaid, there will be very little impact for our patients, 97 percent of whom fall below 138 percent of the federal poverty level. So, unfortunately, the services of a free clinic will be needed just as much as ever.\u201d Linda Bonesteel, director of the Georgetown Community Care Network, agrees that expanded health care is \u201coff the table\u201d for the poorest of the poor in the state under the Affordable Care Act, but the working poor who want health insurance may have options. Bonesteel said Georgetown Memorial Hospital, in cooperation with the Community Care Network and its benefactor, the Duke Endowment, is in the process of training counselors to help people between the ages of 19 and 64 find affordable health insurance. \u201cWe will try and align the available resources for people needing access to health care,\u201d Bonesteel said, \u201clinking transportation and affordable medications. We will work to explore the options available, and that person makes the decision whether they want to opt in or out. Ours is an advocacy role. We can\u2019t direct them to a plan. We help them find assistance. \u201cEveryone is in the process of ramping up to find those subsidies. Every client would be different. That is the unique work when you look at a plan with an individual in front of you.\u201d At the very least, she said, counselors could show individuals who qualify under poverty guidelines how to avoid paying federal penalties on their income tax forms. It\u2019s $95 next year and goes up in the future. Bonesteel said poverty doesn\u2019t matter in determining eligibility for insurance. There is not an individual means test for Medicaid. It is available only to pregnant women, children and the permanently disabled. The majority will continue to seek care at places like the Smith Clinic in Pawleys Island and St. James-Santee Family Health Care in Georgetown. Faul said Smith Medical Clinic, which operates through Holy Cross-Faith Memorial Episcopal Church on Baskervill Drive, will continue to provide care for a patient at a cost of less than $250 per year. \u201cPeople are amazed when they hear that $250 number,\u201d said Charlotte Moore, clinical director. \u201cIt\u2019s all possible because of over 180 volunteers and the strategic partnerships we have with other non-profit agencies and, of course, our enduring partnership with Georgetown Hospital System.\u201d The clinic receives no federal or state funding. Continued operations rely on donations from patients, private foundations and people in the community. \u201cWhat we do would not be possible without the support of this community,\u201d Faul said. \u201cDonors have embraced our Patient Partner Program, where a $250 donation can provide complete medical care for a patient for a full year.\u201d Patients also donate when they are able. Faul said she is proud of the fact that patient donations represented nearly 10 percent of last year\u2019s total budget. \u201cI know patients appreciate the care that they receive at the clinic, she said, \u201cand they give us as much as they are able.\u201d Recently, the clinic received a $100 check in the mail from a former patient with a note that said, \u201cI didn\u2019t always have money to throw in the basket when I was a patient. This donation is from my first paycheck in over three years. You saved my life.\u201d To learn more about Smith Medical Clinic go online to smithfreeclinic.org or contact Faul at 843-237-2672.
