Q: Is eating farm-raised fish better than eating no fish?

A: Experts have raised concerns about farm-raised fish.

In some cases, the animals are raised on unnatural diets and crammed into small enclosures that can promote toxins and breed disease, prompting aquaculture operators to rely heavily on antibiotics.

But farming practices are improving, and consumers have a number of healthy and eco-friendly farmed options, said Tim Fitzgerald, a scientist and sustainable seafood expert at the Environmental Defense Fund. A few of the farmed varieties that are produced responsibly are also relatively high in omega-3 fatty acids, the polyunsaturated fats that promote cardiovascular health. They include arctic char, rainbow trout and oysters, he said.

He recommends eating a mix of farmed and wild seafood.

“You paint yourself into a corner if you say you don’t want to eat any farmed fish ever,” he said. “It automatically removes 50 percent of the U.S. seafood supply from your choices.”

Some good wild options are Alaskan salmon, Atlantic mackerel and sardines.

From a health perspective, farmed salmon is a good choice, said Roxanne Karimi, a research scientist at the School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences at Stony Brook University. Karimi has found that farmed and wild salmon are high in omega-3’s compared with shrimp, tuna and other fish, and they are generally very low in mercury, a particular concern for pregnant women and young children.

When buying fish, keep your smartphone handy. You can find very helpful seafood guides on the Monterey Bay Aquarium and Environmental Defense Fund websites.
