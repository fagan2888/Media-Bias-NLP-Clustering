Getting the students there is the easy part. Getting the parents to leave \u2014 in both mind and spirit \u2014 is the challenge. Indeed, though some colleges have show-parents-the-exit programs, many parents still hover from home.\n\nThe University of Oregon has a section about \u201chelicopter parenting\u201d on its counseling services page. Telltale signs range from texting or emailing more than once a day to completing assignments or pushing a particular major. The counseling center warns that helicopter parenting can result in adult children\u2019s overdependence, inability to make their own decisions and even depression.\n\nAs freshman dean at Stanford University for more than a decade, Julie Lythcott-Haims dealt with hordes of helicopter parents. She started investigating and found that overbearing parents were a phenomenon at colleges around the country. Her research culminated in a new book, How to Raise an Adult: Break Free of the Overparenting Trap and Prepare Your Kids for Success.\n\nWhile overparenting might seem like a 21st-century ill, it was a series of \u201ccultural shifts\u201d in the 1980s that have turned us, she writes, into \u201cour kids\u2019 concierge, personal assistant and secretary \u2026 making sure their lives are safe, selected, chosen, recommended, planned, decided, approved, improved, done, accomplished, handled, coached, figured out, fixed, arranged, solved, resolved, absolved, shaped, designed, orchestrated, enabled and dreamed up.\u201d\n\nHow did that happen? Lythcott-Haims details four changes:\n\nThe increased awareness of child abductions, beginning with the 1981 murder of Adam Walsh. Soon after, missing children\u2019s faces began appearing on milk cartons.\n\nThe 1983 federal report, A Nation at Risk. After it argued that American students could not compete with the their global peers, schoolwork and testing shifted into high gear.\n\nSelf-esteem movement, a philosophy that became popular in the 1980s and resulted in all those soccer trophies for showing up rather than achievement.\n\nThe playdate, circa 1984. This began as record numbers of moms started working and no longer could open the back door to send kids out to play. \u201cOnce parents started scheduling play, they then began observing play, which led to involving themselves in play,\u201d she writes.\n\n\n\nThose kids, the oldest now in their 30s, started going to college in the late 1990s, and that\u2019s when Lythcott-Haims took notice. While the students were more accomplished than ever in terms of activities, grades and courses, they also seemed unable to make decisions without their parents\u2019 help, and they were not the least bit sheepish about it. She writes:\n\n\u201cMy students were not only celebrating the joys of life with parents, they turned to them whenever something went even mildly wrong: a flat tire, a tiff with a roommate, a less than great grade on an assignment, as if their first instinct was to call or text a parent \u2014 an instinct as natural as taking a breath of air \u2014 and as essential. They didn\u2019t seem to know how to contend with what life would throw their way.\u201d\n\nGet discounts on hotels, airfare, car rentals and more \u2014 AARP Member Advantages. \u00bb\n\nLythcott-Haims proposes \u201cAnother Way\u201d of raising children. Some of the suggestions, such as unstructured play time and teaching life skills from cooking to cleaning, are great advice that we can heed as grandparents. And it\u2019s not too late to incorporate some of her ideas for our adult children. Next time the call comes from them with a problem, she suggests: \u201cListen thoughtfully, ask some questions based on our own sense of the situation, then say, OK. So how do you think you\u2019re going to handle that?\u2019\u201d\n\nBecause we have \u201cbeen there, done that\u201d with many of life\u2019s big and little problems, it\u2019s so easy to jump in with the fix for our adult children. But Lythcott-Haims offers a compelling reason to resist that temptation: \u201cTrying to boost them up, we are paradoxically tearing them down. We over-help so as not to disadvantage them, yet they\u2019re disadvantaged because we do so much.\u201d\n\nMary W.
