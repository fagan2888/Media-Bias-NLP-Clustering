Here\u2019s a sampling.\n\n1. Trump goes to Twitter war with Elizabeth Warren\u2014doesn\u2019t win.\n\nPresumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump spent a large portion of his week engaging in sophomoric Twitter feuds, which may well be how he would conduct foreign policy if he is elected. There was his juvenile spat with former fanboy Joe Scarborough, who announced he won\u2019t be voting for Trump. But when Elizabeth Warren flamed him following his victory in Indiana and ascension to all-but-certain nominee status, he uncharacteristically took a couple of days to muster his response. Friday night, he came out with this intellectually lofty gem: \u201cI hope corrupt Hillary Clinton chooses goofy Elizabeth Warren as her running mate. I will defeat them both.\u201d\n\nWarren was not terribly impressed. Goofy? She wondered. Is the name of a lovable Disney character really the best you can do? \u201cFor a guy with \u2018the best words\u2019 that\u2019s a pretty lame nickname. Weak!\u201d she retorted.\n\nBut Trump was sticking to his adjectival guns, and without another bullet in his chamber went back to his old favorite. \u201cGoofy Elizabeth Warren, Hillary Clinton\u2019s flunky, has a career that is totally based on a lie. She is not Native American.\u201d\n\nOne thing is for sure, the Donald is definitely making the twittersphere great again.\n\nRead more of the back and forth.\n\n2. Lord of Darkness endorses Trump.\n\nThere\u2019s not much of a joke here. Just an all-over skin crawl coupled with an all-over shudder and sickening gut twist. Dick Cheney has endorsed Trump. That\u2019s all. In doing so, the Iraq-war architect has broken rank with other prominent Republicans like the entire Bush clan, John McCain, Lindsey Graham and Mitt Romney. Not to mention House Speaker Paul Ryan who has so far just said no to Trump. We can only assume that Cheney just really wants to go to the GOP convention in Cleveland this summer. Perhaps the Darth Vader admirer\u2019s dancecard is coming up empty these days.\n\nCheney said he would back Trump, despite earlier saying that Trump sounded too much \u201clike a liberal Democrat,\u201d when he criticized the decision to invade Iraq and said the Bush administration lied about the existence of weapons of mass destruction. Trump did not sound like a liberal Democrat when he stated this fact. He sounded like a man in the throes of a rare moment of lucidity.\n\nBut now, Cheney doesn\u2019t care about that. Or he does not remember it, and as long as his artificial heart keeps ticking, he\u2019s jumping on board the Trump carnival caravan. Woo hoo!\n\n3. Bill O\u2019Reilly is incredulous that people criticized Trump\u2019s ridiculous Cinco de Mayo tweet.\n\nPoor Papa Bear O\u2019Reilly. Stephen Colbert may no longer be making merciless fun of him on a nightly basis, but the modern world is just so confusing for him. Here, his perfectly nice, though somewhat cheapskate milkshake pal Donald simply tweeted something about eating a taco and loving \u201cthe Hispanics,\u201d and now everyone is criticizing him. What are a couple of clueless old white guys with deeply insulting strains of cynicism supposed to do?\n\nO\u2019Reilly aired his outrage on his show, natch, saying:\n\nYesterday was Cinco de Mayo. Donald Trump tweeted out a picture of himself eating tacos. Above the picture he said that he loves Hispanics. Almost immediately, the president of the militant organization La Raza tweeted out, \u201cEating a taco or wearing a sombrero doesn\u2019t cut it with our community in 2016. Trump is clueless, offensive and self promoting.\u201d\n\nSo eating a taco on Cinco De Mayo is now offensive? That\u2019s like saying eating corned beef and cabbage on St. Patrick\u2019s Day, and saying you love the Irish is offensive. That\u2019s how insane American culture has become.\n\nApparently, O\u2019Reilly is conveniently unfamiliar with the concept of pandering, and the fact that Trump has been relentlessly demonizing Mexicans and other Latinos literally since the day he announced his candidacy. Also, anyone who disagrees with O\u2019Reilly is de facto \u201cmilitant.\u201d\n\nTalk about insane.\n\n4. Fox News tweets unhinged thing about Planned Parenthood.\n\nThe fact-free zone of Faux News has always been impervious to, well, reality in general, and certainly the somewhat mundane reality of what Planned Parenthood actually does: providing reproductive healthcare for women, all women (and some men), regardless of their ability to pay.\n\nSounds like a dastardly plot to Fox, which never misses a chance to gin up extremist hatred and potential violence toward the life-saving organization. Not content with peddling the fiction that Planned Parenthood illegally traffics in baby parts, Fox has taken the hysteria-mongering one step further this week. A FoxNews.com article said the healthcare provider\u2019s latest diabolical venture is helping \u201ctransgender patients with sex changes.\u201d\n\nHow horrible! Wait, why?\n\nFox\u2019s Cinco de Mayo article claims that since Planned Parenthood stopped \u201cselling baby body parts for money,\u201d the \u201cgender reassignment process may enable the organization to make up the lost cash.\u201d\n\nOf course, the fetal parts profiteering myth has been utterly debunked, and offering trans-inclusive healthcare is something the organization has been doing going back about 50 years, but Fox has never been one to turn down a chance to sow further hatred. And trans people and the people who love and help them are favorite targets these days.\n\nDisgusting, despicable and vile. Just another day at Fox News.\n\n5. Katrina Pierson just has a little suggestion for Paul Ryan.\n\nCNN served up quite a softball for nutty Trump spokesperson Katrina Pierson this week, after House Speaker and Ayn Rand-lover Paul Ryan declined to endorse Trump but stopped short of saying #NeverTrump.\n\nCNN asked, \u201cIf the Republican speaker of the House does not come around to supporting the Republican nominee, do you think that Paul Ryan is still fit to be Speaker? \u201c\n\nHer answer will probably surprise no one, but she delivered it with her usual hard-right conservative flair, saying:\n\nNo. Because this is about the party. You have to understand\u2014the last two cycles we were told John McCain was a conservative, he is not a conservative, his Conservative Review score card is 37%. We were told Mitt Romney is a conservative, and he was pro-abortion\u2026 gave us Obamacare, we were told to hold our noses and vote for the sake of the party. These same people are now telling us that because their guy didn\u2019t win they want to hurt the party\u2026\n\nNo word on how Pierson will explain Trump\u2019s inevitable dishonest tack to the center as the general election campaign progresses.\n\nStay tuned.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Elizabeth Warren out-tweets the presumptive nominee, while Bill O'Reilly serves up a taco bowl of anti-P.C. malarky", "title": "5 worst right-wing moments of the week \u2014 Donald Trump finally gets punked", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Elizabeth Warren out-tweets the presumptive nominee, while Bill O'Reilly serves up a taco bowl of anti-P.C. malarky", "title": "5 worst right-wing moments of the week \u2014 Donald Trump finally gets punked", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/05/09/5_worst_right_wing_moments_of_the_week_donald_trump_finally_gets_punked_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/04/trump-today-2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Elizabeth Warren out-tweets the presumptive nominee, while Bill O'Reilly serves up a taco bowl of anti-P.C. malarky", "title": "5 worst right-wing moments of the week \u2014 Donald Trump finally gets punked", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/04/trump-today-2.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Janet Allon", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, AlterNet, Bill O'Reilly, Donald Trump, Elizabeth Warren, samantha bee", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "That\u2019s like saying eating corned beef and cabbage on St. Patrick\u2019s Day, and saying you love the Irish is offensive.\nNot to mention House Speaker Paul Ryan who has so far just said no to Trump.\nYou have to understand\u2014the last two cycles we were told John McCain was a conservative, he is not a conservative, his Conservative Review score card is 37%.\nTrump is clueless, offensive and self promoting.\u201dSo eating a taco on Cinco De Mayo is now offensive?\nThere was his juvenile spat with former fanboy Joe Scarborough, who announced he won\u2019t be voting for Trump."}
