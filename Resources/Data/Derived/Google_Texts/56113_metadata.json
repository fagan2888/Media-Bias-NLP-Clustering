Carson is promoting a book he has co-authored with his wife Candy Carson entitled 'A More Perfect Union: What We the People Can Do to Reclaim Our Constitutional Liberties.'\n\nFormer neurosurgeon Ben Carson has become an unlikely frontrunner in the GOP presidential primary, leading recent polls in Iowa and surpassing all of the other Republican candidates\u2019 recent fundraising totals.\n\nThough he has never held political office, his short time in the spotlight has given him plenty of opportunity to make controversial and often factually incorrect statements. In May, ThinkProgress highlighted seven ridiculous things that Ben Carson believes. But in the past six months, Carson has come up with even more incendiary remarks and comparisons, which seem to only help his campaign.\n\nHere are 13 arguments that Carson has made during his political career:\n\nWomen who get abortions are like slaveholders\n\nOn NBC\u2019s Meet the Press in October, Carson compared women who terminate their unwanted pregnancies to slaveowners who \u201cthought that they had the right to do whatever they wanted to that slave.\u201d\n\nHe went on to call for an outlaw of abortion, even in cases of rape and incest. \u201cI would not be in favor of killing a baby because the baby came about in that way,\u201d he said.\n\nObamacare is the worst thing since slavery\n\nCarson\u2019s abortion comments were just the latest in a series of arguments he has made comparing things to slavery. Back in 2013, when Carson was still gaining recognition in the Republican Party, he said in a speech that \u201cObamacare is really I think the worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd it is in a way, it is slavery in a way, because it is making all of us subservient to the government, and it was never about health care,\u201d he added. \u201cIt was about control.\u201d\n\n\u2018Hitler\u2019 could happen in the U.S. today\n\nSimilarly, Carson has made a series of comments invoking Nazi Germany since launching his campaign. In September, he said at a campaign event that a Nazi-like force could come to power in the United States.\n\n\u201cIf you go back and look at the history of the world, tyranny and despotism and how it starts, it has a lot to do with control of thought and control of speech,\u201d he said, although he refused to outright say he was referring to President Obama.\n\nJews could have prevented the Holocaust if they had guns\n\nIn an interview with CNN in October, Carson blamed the Holocaust on the fact that Nazis took guns away from the Jewish people. \u201cI think the likelihood of Hitler being able to accomplish his goals would have been greatly diminished if the people had been armed,\u201d Carson said. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason these dictatorial people take the guns first.\u201d\n\nWhen pressed about why he repeatedly uses Nazi metaphors, Carson blamed the media for stirring controversy, saying that he\u2019s heard \u201cfrom many people in the Jewish community, including rabbis, who said, \u2018You\u2019re spot on. You are exactly right.\u2019\u201d\n\nCollege campuses should be monitored for liberal political speech\n\nOn Glenn Beck\u2019s radio program in October, Carson advocated for the censorship of \u201cextreme political bias\u201d on college campuses, saying the Department of Education should \u201cmonitor our institutions of higher education for extreme political bias and deny federal funding if it exists.\u201d\n\nThe next day, he clarified during a different conservative radio program that his plan wouldn\u2019t hurt conservatives. When host Dana Loesch asked if \u201cthe pendulum would swing the other way and we would see sort of like monitoring of political speech for conservatives,\u201d Carson assured her that it would not. \u201cI think we would have to put in very strict guidelines for the way that that was done,\u201d he said.\n\nMuslims should be disqualified from the presidency\n\nDuring an interview on Meet the Press in September, Carson now infamously said that a Muslim could not become the president of the United States. \u201cI would not advocate that we put a Muslim in charge of this nation,\u201d he said. \u201cI absolutely would not agree with that.\u201d\n\nInstead of apologizing, Carson went on to explain his remarks. In order for a Muslim to become president, he said, \u201cyou have to reject the tenets of Islam.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a war on \u2018what\u2019s inside of women\u2019\n\nDuring a campaign stop this summer, Carson denied the argument used to describe the Republican Party\u2019s policies that restrict women\u2019s rights.\n\n\u201cThere is no war on women,\u201d he said. \u201cThere may be a war on what\u2019s inside of women, but there is no war on women in this country.\u201d\n\nBeing gay is a choice because prison turns people gay\n\nCarson said in a CNN interview in March that homosexuality is a choice, citing people who \u201cgo into prison straight \u2013 and when they come out, they\u2019re gay\u201d as proof. He later attempted to apologize for the remarks in which he addressed those who were offended, but reinforced his belief that sexual orientation is chosen.\n\nCarson has also called marriage equality a \u201cMarxist plot,\u201d described marriage equality supporters as \u201cenemies of America,\u201d and compared homosexuality to pedophilia and bestiality, another statement that led him to similarly \u201capologize\u201d for his \u201cpoorly chosen words.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no such thing as a war crime\n\nCarson also said earlier this year that the U.S. should not hesitate to send troops to defeat the Islamic State and should not fear prosecution for any of its actions abroad. In the Fox News interview, he suggested that the military should not be subject to any war crimes law.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re gonna have rules for war, you should just have a rule that says no war,\u201d he said. \u201cOther than that, we have to win.\u201d\n\nObama is depressing the economy to keep people on welfare\n\nAfter appearing on The View last year and saying that Americans have become dependent on welfare, Carson elaborated on Fox News. \u201cDo you think that people who are on welfare want to be on welfare?\u201d Fox\u2019s Megyn Kelly asked him.\n\n\u201cI think some people have that as a way of life,\u201d Carson responded, later adding that \u201cperhaps some of the things that are going on right now which could be easily remedied are not being remedied in order to keep the economy depressed because there would be no appetite for many of the social programs if people were doing well.\u201d\n\nObama signed immigration reform to bring in government-dependent voters\n\nAfter speaking out about welfare, Carson said in an interview months later that Obama\u2019s executive action on immigration was part of a \u201cnefarious agenda\u201d to bring new voters into the United States who will be dependent on government.\n\n\u201cIs he just trying to instead of get out the vote, bring in the vote?\u201d former Republican Rep. J.D. Hayworth asked Carson. \u201cIs this all designed to have new voters \u2014 despite the fact he claims they\u2019re not going to get citizenship \u2014 is the long-term goal to bring in a new class of voters dependent on government?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course it is,\u201d Carson replied.\n\nCongress should be able to remove judges for voting for marriage equality\n\nIn an interview with a conservative radio host earlier this year, Carson said it was \u201cunconstitutional\u201d that judges have ruled in favor of equality despite statewide ballot initiatives that resulted in different outcomes. Carson said that when federal judges make rulings like this, \u201cour Congress actually has the right to reprimand or remove them.\u201d\n\nAnarchy could cancel the 2016 election\n\nCarson warned in an interview in 2014 that if we \u201ccontinue down this pathway that we are going down,\u201d referring to \u201cthis pathway where everything is framed in a political sense and our representatives are not working for the people, they\u2019re working for their party,\u201d then the anarchy could lead to the 2016 election being called off. He claimed that the growing national debt, ISIS and the then-Democratic controlled U.S. Senate\u2019s refusal to consider legislation passed by the Republican House of Representatives all pointed toward the idea that the country is headed toward anarchy.\n\nIf Carson\u2019s prediction proved to be true, he said, Obama could declare martial law and the 2016 election would not occur.\n\nNote: This post is an updated version of a post previously published by ThinkProgress when Carson launched his campaign in May 2015.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "A small sampling of the Republican candidate's controversial comments.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "A small sampling of the Republican candidate's controversial comments.", "title": "13 Ridiculous Things Ben Carson Actually Believes", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2015/10/26/3715969/ben-carson-ridiculousness-continues/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/26092643/AP_218686079534-600x315.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A small sampling of the Republican candidate's controversial comments.", "creator": "@Kira_Lerner", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/26092643/AP_218686079534-321x214.jpg", "title": "13 Ridiculous Things Ben Carson Actually Believes", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-politics", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/26092643/AP_218686079534-540x303.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/26092643/AP_218686079534-99x66.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-26T10:17:30+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/KiraLerner"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Politics 13 Ridiculous Things Ben Carson Actually Believes CREDIT: AP Photo/Andrew Harnik Republican presidential candidate Dr. Ben Carson speaks at a luncheon at the National Press Club in Washington, Friday, Oct. 9, 2015.\nIn May, ThinkProgress highlighted seven ridiculous things that Ben Carson believes.\n\u201cOther than that, we have to win.\u201dObama is depressing the economy to keep people on welfareAfter appearing on The View last year and saying that Americans have become dependent on welfare, Carson elaborated on Fox News.\nNote: This post is an updated version of a post previously published by ThinkProgress when Carson launched his campaign in May 2015.\nBut in the past six months, Carson has come up with even more incendiary remarks and comparisons, which seem to only help his campaign."}
