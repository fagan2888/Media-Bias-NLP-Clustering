According to that survey, the general election next year will be between Hillary Rodham Clinton and Chris Christie -- a remarkable turn of fortune for the New Jersey governor (if only it were true).\n\nIn the process, we realized that the associations people have with political terms are . . . diverse. A GIF of a dog chasing its tail might be one result when you search for, say, Newt Gingrich 2012. (It isn't, but it could be.) Using the search tool at the GIF repository Giphy, we searched for various political terms and chose random GIFs that appeared as a result. Our challenge to you: Can you guess the term we searched for?\n\nHint: As is often the case with our quizzes, it is harder than it seems.
