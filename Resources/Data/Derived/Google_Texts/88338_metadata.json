The N.Y. Times calls to profile you. Do you cooperate? \u2013 B\u2019DAYS: Addie Whisenant, Dominique Mann\n\nBy Mike Allen ( mallen@politico.com, @mikeallen), with Daniel Lippman ( dlippman@politico.com; @dlippman)\n\nTHE BUZZ: Jason Horowitz, the scalpel-wielding profile/features writer in the N.Y. Times Washington bureau, is profiling David Krone, chief of staff to Harry Reid. Krone strained relations with the White House when a front-page WashPost tick-tock the morning after midterms quoted Krone on the record as saying POTUS could have been more financially helpful to embattled Senate Dems: \u201cWe were never going to get on the same page. ... We were beating our heads against the wall.\u201d Will Jason have a kiss for Krone, as a D.C. truth-teller? Or will he throw a dagger like he did at Robert Gibbs?\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n--LOOK FOR KRONE to sit down with Horowitz, according to Capitol Hill sources. Friends say Krone didn\u2019t want to engage. But Jason was so persistent, and called so many people, that the chief is likely to give an interview, trusting Jason to be fair.\n\n--WHAT KRONE can be expected to say about the post-mortem: Krone believed the White House had shot first. The Post had been chasing Krone, who kept declining to talk. Then, just before the election, the reporter emailed to recount what the White House had said about Krone and the caucus. DSCC Executive Director Guy Cecil was hearing similar things. So Krone and Adam Jentleson, Reid\u2019s communications director, met with The Post. Krone responded to quotes from the White House. Thus the detonation.\n\nSCOOP DU JOUR --\u201cHarry Reid wants Warren in Senate leadership,\u201d by Manu Raju and John Bresnahan: \u201cThe incoming Senate minority leader, Harry Reid, is engaged in private talks with the Massachusetts freshman to create a special leadership post for the former Harvard professor ... It\u2019s unclear exactly what the new job would entail \u2014 but luring the populist liberal into leadership could inject fresh blood into a team reeling from significant midterm election losses. Adding Warren ... would bring in a nationally known name who could help sharpen the Democratic message as it goes toe-to-toe with the new Senate Republican majority.\u201d http://politi.co/11jZSRk\n\n--\u201cA Behind-The-Scenes Peek Inside The Mitch McConnell Legacy Vault\u201d -- ABC News\u2019 Jeff Zeleny: \u201cIt\u2019s McConnell like we\u2019ve rarely seen him before.

Jason Chaffetz, who is trying to leapfrog five more-senior members, and Ohio Rep. Mike Turner, who is No. 3 in seniority, have spent months furiously lobbying the members of the House Republican Steering Committee, which will meet next week to consider their cases. But all the lobbying may not matter. Boehner has five votes, his leadership team will follow him and vote in a bloc and the speaker has sway over most of the remaining votes ... As Boehner walked onto the House floor Wednesday night, he let out a loud laugh when a POLITICO reporter asked him who would be the next Oversight and Government Reform chairman. Republican leadership insiders are watching the race closely and think Chaffetz has a slight edge over Turner.\u201d http://politi.co/1EFBWG6\n\nINSIDE THE WEST WING \u2013 \u201cThe selling of Obamacare 2.0: TV\u2019s out; hashtags are in,\u201d by Joanne Kenen: \u201cThe second year of Obamacare enrollment starts Saturday, and the administration is launching a much more precise strategy that uses targeted digital ads, aims at specific demographics and leverages social media ...

Cohan in Politico Magazine: \u201cWhile the finance industry does genuinely hate Warren, the big bankers love Clinton, and by and large they badly want her to be president. Many of the rich and powerful in the financial industry\u2014among them, Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein, Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman, Tom Nides, a powerful vice chairman at Morgan Stanley, and the heads of JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America\u2014consider Clinton a pragmatic problem-solver not prone to populist rhetoric. \u2026\n\n\u201cThe informal head of her informal Wall Street outreach effort ... is a finance executive she knows well\u2014and recruited to work for her at the State Department. Tom Nides, 53, the Morgan Stanley executive, knows both New York and Washington intimately. Today he speaks with Clinton regularly and has begun to play the role of gatekeeper on Wall Street to her embryonic campaign.

Jim Webb, the former Virginia senator who has made noise about running for president, and outgoing Maryland Gov. [Martin] O\u2019Malley, the only one laying any groundwork toward a run.
