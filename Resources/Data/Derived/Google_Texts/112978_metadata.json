That\u2019s adding to pressure on physicians who have been debating whether to join their local hospital, merge their practices into ever-bigger groups or get out of medicine.\n\nSpecialists warn that patients in some areas of the country may have difficulty finding their services as small, rural practices close and the doctors join larger companies. Just 35 percent of physicians described their practices as independent in a 2014 survey, down from 62 percent in 2008, according to the Physicians Foundation, a nonprofit advocacy group for the profession.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re really losing ready access in many parts of the country that are rural,\u201d said Bruce Sigsbee, a neurologist who works for a hospital system in Rockport, Maine. He is the immediate past president of the American Academy of Neurology. \u201cThere does seem to be a perceived push for people to leave independent practice by these policies.\u201d\n\nJeffrey Ward, an Edmonds, Washington cancer doctor who sold his practice to one of Seattle\u2019s largest hospital chains about two years ago, said he worries that Medicare may encourage doctors to provide less treatments like chemotherapy -- among the costliest and most lucrative of oncologists\u2019 services.\n\nHastening Extinction\n\nFee-for-service \u201cis on its way to extinction. Bundling will hasten it,\u201d Ward said, referring to one possible payment change. \u201cWhether that\u2019s a good thing or a bad thing is in the eye of the beholder.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. health secretary, Sylvia Mathews Burwell, announced Jan. 26 that she wants at least 30 percent of Medicare\u2019s $362 billion in fee-for-service payments moved, by 2017, into new programs that demand accountability from doctors and hospitals and in some cases penalize them if their care doesn\u2019t meet quality and efficiency standards. The fraction would rise to 50 percent by 2019.\n\nSpecialists will find the changes the most wrenching because they are largely paid based on how many services they perform. Primary physicians, on the other hand, expect a new system will compensate them for work they haven\u2019t historically been paid for doing, such as monitoring their patients\u2019 health between office visits. The Obama administration hasn\u2019t finished programs to test new ways to compensate specialists.\n\nOncologist Start\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not clear to me in this proposal how they would be included or even participate,\u201d Lou Goodman, the president of the Physicians Foundation, based in Columbia, South Carolina, said in a phone interview.\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services plans to start with oncologists as it experiments with ways to pay specialists. Cancer doctors said they expect the government to attempt to pay them a single fee for all of the care each patient needs. Medicare already uses the concept, called \u201cbundled payment,\u201d in limited ways, including to pay dialysis centers that treat people with kidney failure.\n\nSpecialists who aren\u2019t closing their practices and taking jobs at hospitals are trying to get bigger, to consolidate market share and improve their negotiating positions with insurers. Tennessee Oncology, a group of cancer doctors based in Nashville, has grown from three doctors in 1992 to 85 today, said Jeff Patton, the firm\u2019s chief executive officer.\n\nCancer Care\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve fared well in the fee-for-service world because we\u2019ve played the fee-for-service game pretty well,\u201d he said. \u201cGetting big matters.\u201d\n\nThe company is preparing for the future, he said. At one of its 32 clinics, it is testing an arrangement with the insurer Blue Cross Blue Shield of Tennessee in which oncologists act as primary care physicians for people with advanced cancer, monitoring their health, trying to prevent expensive emergency room visits and hospitalizations.\n\n\u201cIf we do deliver savings at that site, we\u2019re giving other payers and CMS a free ride,\u201d he said, using an acronym for the Medicare agency. Tennessee Oncology will be fine in a world in which fee-for-service payment is diminished, he said. \u201cLife\u2019s about innovation.\u201d\n\nThousands of primary-care physicians have joined programs created by Obamacare that reward them for coordinating patients\u2019 care with other doctors and keeping people out of hospitals. The programs encourage physicians to remain in private practice -- in some cases, even loaning money to small doctors\u2019 offices for computer systems and staff to keep up with record-keeping.\n\nMonitoring Patients\n\n\u201cThis is a bless-your-heart day,\u201d Doug Henley, the executive director of the American Academy of Family Physicians, told Burwell when she announced the Obama administration\u2019s plan.\n\nGood primary care requires doctors to keep in touch with chronically ill patients, such as diabetics, when they aren\u2019t in the physician\u2019s office -- making sure they are taking medications, watching their diet, exercising and monitoring indicators of their health, Henley said.\n\n\u201cA fee-for-service system only incentivizes that face-to-face visit,\u201d Henley said in a phone interview. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t pay for any of that other stuff.\u201d\n\nMcAllen Savings\n\nEven very small groups of primary care physicians have had success in Medicare\u2019s new payment arrangements. Two years ago, 13 family physicians in McAllen, Texas -- acting after their town found itself the subject of an unflattering New Yorker story on high U.S. medical spending -- joined the Medicare program, which required them to create what is called an \u201caccountable care organization.\u201d\n\nIn their first year, the McAllen doctors saved Medicare $6 million. The doctors kept about $1.6 million for themselves, after paying back a loan from the government. Most of the savings came by reducing patients\u2019 use of unnecessary or even fraudulent home-health services, Kenneth Oates, the administrator for the group, called the Rio Grande Valley Health Alliance, said in a phone interview.\n\nThis year, the McAllen doctors are targeting overuse of hospital services, including emergency rooms. \u201cHospitals won\u2019t like that too much, but that\u2019s the way it goes,\u201d Oates said.\n\nReducing the use of health-care services is how programs like Oates\u2019 work, Goodman said -- a problem for specialists, paid based on the quantity of their work.\n\n\u201cThey reduce admissions, reduce ER visits, reduce procedures, reduce imaging,\u201d Goodman said. \u201cThe specialists should be paid to be available whether they perform a service or not. That\u2019s a complicated concept. I haven\u2019t seen any government programs that do that.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Alex Wayne", "twitter": {"description": "The Obama administration\u2019s push to transform the way the U.S. pays for health care is splitting the medical profession, as family doctors embrace changes that oncologists, neurologists and other specialists are concerned will cause turmoil.", "title": "Specialist Doctors Head for Exit as U.S. Shifts Payments", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-02/specialist-doctors-head-for-exit-as-u-s-shifts-payments", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iOFsT8vUGAFc/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "site": "@business", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-author": "Alex Wayne", "parsely-type": "post", "keywords": "Health,Family,Cancer", "news_keywords": "Health,Family,Cancer", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-02/specialist-doctors-head-for-exit-as-u-s-shifts-payments", "parsely-title": "Specialist Doctors Head for Exit as U.S. Shifts Payments", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff0000", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-02-02T05:01:00.005Z", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "The Obama administration\u2019s push to transform the way the U.S. pays for health care is splitting the medical profession, as family doctors embrace changes that oncologists, neurologists and other specialists are concerned will cause turmoil.", "parsely-tags": "Health,Family,Cancer,Region: Global,Page: article", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.bwbx.io/business/public/images/favicons/mstile-144x144-bbd2101292.png", "date": "2015-02-02T05:01:00.005Z", "parsely-section": "science-energy", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "og": {"site_name": "Bloomberg.com", "description": "The Obama administration\u2019s push to transform the way the U.S. pays for health care is splitting the medical profession, as family doctors embrace changes that oncologists, neurologists and other specialists are concerned will cause turmoil.", "title": "Specialist Doctors Head for Exit as U.S. Shifts Payments", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-02/specialist-doctors-head-for-exit-as-u-s-shifts-payments", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iOFsT8vUGAFc/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "type": "website"}, "fb": {"status": "The Obama administration\u2019s push to transform the way the U.S. pays for health care is splitting the medical profession, as family doctors embrace changes that oncologists, neurologists and other specialists are concerned will cause turmoil."}, "parsely-post-id": "NIXZT46JIJUR01", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "parsely-image-url": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iOFsT8vUGAFc/v1/-1x-1.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2d7b\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t pay for any of that other stuff.\u201dMcAllen SavingsEven very small groups of primary care physicians have had success in Medicare\u2019s new payment arrangements.\n\u201cLife\u2019s about innovation.\u201dThousands of primary-care physicians have joined programs created by Obamacare that reward them for coordinating patients\u2019 care with other doctors and keeping people out of hospitals.\nThe government set a timetable last week to extinguish Medicare\u2019s \u201cfee-for-service\u201d system, which rewards the quantity of care over quality.\nThe Obama administration\u2019s push to transform the way the U.S. pays for health care is splitting the medical profession, as family doctors embrace changes that oncologists, neurologists and other specialists are concerned will cause turmoil.\nTennessee Oncology, a group of cancer doctors based in Nashville, has grown from three doctors in 1992 to 85 today, said Jeff Patton, the firm\u2019s chief executive officer."}
