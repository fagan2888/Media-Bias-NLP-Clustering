× MinuteClinic walk-in medical clinics open in four CVS pharmacy stores in Milwaukee area

MILWAUKEE (WITI) — The first MinuteClinic walk-in medical clinics have opened in Wisconsin inside four CVS/pharmacy stores in Milwaukee, Menomonee Falls and Waukesha.

MinuteClinic, the retail medical clinic of CVS Health has locations in 31 states and the District of Columbia.

MinuteClinic expects to open a fifth location in Whitefish Bay in December and clinics in Fox Point and Kenosha in early 2015.

The MinuteClinic locations are open seven days a week with no appointment necessary. Most major health insurance is accepted. For patients paying cash or credit, treatment prices are posted at each clinic and on www.minuteclinic.com. The cost for most services starts at $79.

“We face a significant shortage in primary care providers, an aging Baby Boomer population and the addition of millions of newly insured patients through the Affordable Care Act. By increasing access to high quality, affordable care at convenient clinic locations, MinuteClinic can help support the primary care medical home in Wisconsin,” Andrew Sussman, M.D., MinuteClinic President and CVS Health Senior Vice President/Associate Chief Medical Officer said in a statement posted on CVS’ website.

MinuteClinic nurse practitioners specialize in family health care and can diagnose, treat and write prescriptions for common family illnesses such as strep throat and ear, eye, sinus, bladder and bronchial infections. Minor wounds, abrasions, skin conditions and joint sprains are treated, and common vaccinations such as influenza, tetanus, pneumonia and Hepatitis A & B are available at most locations. Walk-in camp, sports and college physicals are available daily.

In addition, MinuteClinic administers a series of wellness services designed to help patients identify lifestyle changes needed to improve their current and future health, including screenings and monitoring for diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol.

At the conclusion of each visit, MinuteClinic practitioners give the patient a visit summary, educational material and a prescription (when clinically appropriate). A diagnostic record is sent via electronic health record, fax or mail to the patient’s primary care provider with permission.

Sussman says MinuteClinic is committed to helping patients find a medical home and believes it can play a complementary role in working with primary care providers.

“About 50 percent of our visits occur on evenings, weekends and holidays when patients may not be able to get an appointment with their primary care provider. And about half of the patients we see at MinuteClinic do not have a personal physician,” Sussman said.

Patients who visit MinuteClinic without a primary care provider are provided a list of physicians in the area who are accepting new patients.

“MinuteClinic also has affiliations with 47 major health systems around the country, with joint clinical programs and integration of electronic medical records,” Sussman said.
