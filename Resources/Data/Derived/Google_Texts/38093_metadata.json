Most presidents, especially at certain points during their time in office and especially when Congress is held by a majority in the opposing party, are critiqued for their ability to lead. But Obama has had some specific complaints lobbed at him regarding his ability to work with others; some of them are fair points. First, let\u2019s look at his approval rating.\n\nWhile Obama\u2019s performance approval numbers have been quite low \u2014 something critics are quick to leap on \u2014 they haven\u2019t been that much worse than other presidents during the same term. According to the Pew Research Center, Obama\u2019s 47% approval rating in January of his second term was higher than George W. Bush\u2019s (33%), lower than Bill Clinton\u2019s (63%), and around the same as Ronald Reagan\u2019s (49%) during their second terms at the same time.\n\nOne thing that can be said for Obama is that of all the presidents in the last 60 years, he has the lowest high, although not the lowest low. In other words, thus far, his highest approval rating was 64% in February 2009, which is lower than the lowest since 1958, at 68% (Presidents Richard Nixon and Reagan). Given his upcoming exit from office and the general trend in controversial presidencies to go from high to low, its unlikely he\u2019ll be making it above 64%.\n\nObama\u2019s lowest approval rating, on the other hand, was at 41% in November 2013, according to the Pew Research Center\u2019s polling numbers. This may not be consistent with other polls that have him at a lower approval rating, but for the sake of comparing across presidencies, it\u2019s at least a consistent source of polling data. What a comparison to other presidencies shows is that Obama\u2019s lowest approval number is actually considerably higher than all but two other presidents since Eisenhower.\n\nJust because Obama\u2019s worst moments haven\u2019t dropped as low as George W. Bush\u2019s or Nixon\u2019s (at 22% and 24% approval, respectively) doesn\u2019t mean there haven\u2019t been legitimate concerns with his leadership. In particular, people from both sides of the aisle have discussed his hesitancy when it comes to making connections and greasing the wheels to get things done.\n\n\u201cFor him, eating his spinach is schmoozing with elected officials,\u201d said Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Missouri) of Obama, per the New York Times. For some, this may seem like a compliment, especially those who grow frustrated with politicians in Washington, D.C.\n\nBut schmoozing is sometimes what is needed to work with groups and individuals who may not be sold on policy initiatives. Which isn\u2019t to say that a little hand-holding and a couple of beers between lawmakers would have convinced Ted Cruz that Obamacare was the greatest thing since sliced bread, but even just making the appearance of trying \u2014 beyond calculated press releases back and forth over each side\u2019s willingness to work with the other may have made a difference.\n\nIt becomes abundantly clear how important this failing is for Obama when you consider Gallup\u2019s polling results for his job approval and his ability to manage the government effectively viewed in parallel, as shown below. \u201cThe ability to manage government is clearly important to Americans, and previous Gallup research has shown that Americans cite management as one of the top qualities they desire in a president,\u201d reports Gallup.\n\nSource: Gallup Source: Gallup\n\nMost of the exchanges we\u2019ve seen between the executive branch and legislature have involved Congress considering legislation that Obama promises to veto, Congress passing the bill anyways, and Obama vetoing it. That, or executive actions \u2014 most of which draw ire from Republicans and slow government accomplishments while attention is given to that conflict \u2014 which only have a short-term effect or are limited to a smaller group of affected individuals within the government\u2019s employees or contractors.\n\n\u201cHe approaches things like a law professor in presenting the logic of his position,\u201d said David Axelrod, a former White House adviser, to Bloomberg. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that there\u2019s a theatrical nature to the presidency that he resists. Sometimes he can be negligent in the symbolism.\u201d The president\u2019s systematic logic and research-based decision-making is what appeals to many, but it can also alienate others, coming off as both cold and calculating. It may seem as if there\u2019s not much leeway for cooperation, nor room for the emotionally charged discourse so many Republicans bring to the table on major issues.\n\nFollow Anthea on Twitter @AntheaWSCS\n\nCheck out Politics Cheat Sheet on Facebook\n\nMore from Politics Cheat Sheet:", "article_metadata": {"syndication-source": "http://www.cheatsheet.com/politics/where-do-americans-think-obamas-leadership-failed.html/", "sailthru.date": "2015-04-21 12:10:03", "sailthru.author": "anthea-mitchell", "news_keywords": "Congress,Obama,President,Polls,", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Cheat Sheet", "description": "Over the last few years, there has been an increasing amount said about President Barack Obama's managerial style.", "title": "The Reasons Some Americans Think Obama Has Failed", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/i5xb31-jbksfcygqnjxida.png", "url": "http://www.cheatsheet.com/politics/where-do-americans-think-obamas-leadership-failed.html/?a=viewall", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Over the last few years, there has been an increasing amount said about President Barack Obama's managerial style.", "creator": "@AntheaWSCS", "image": "http://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/465481371-640x460.jpg", "title": "The Reasons Some Americans Think Obama Has Failed", "site": "@cheatsheet", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The Cheat Sheet", "robots": "noodp", "DC.date.issued": "2015-04-21T12:10:03-04:00", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "936edf149ecbc3171d89b1f25f05e153"}, "fb": {"admins": 826582091, "app_id": 354932851235506}, "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/President-Obama-150x100.jpg", "item-category": "US Politics", "sailthru.tags": "politics,elections,usa-politics,congress,obama,president", "google-site-verification": "ktiOxQqv9Xlcn7qytDrsOVw_-MQ9S7bo2G5Iyfu-I9M", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wallstcheatsheet", "section": "Elections", "tag": "President", "published_time": "2015-04-21T12:10:03-04:00"}, "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/President-Obama.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "description": "Over the last few years, there has been an increasing amount said about President Barack Obama's managerial style."}, "article_summary": "Obama\u2019s lowest approval rating, on the other hand, was at 41% in November 2013, according to the Pew Research Center\u2019s polling numbers.\nFirst, let\u2019s look at his approval rating.\nWhat a comparison to other presidencies shows is that Obama\u2019s lowest approval number is actually considerably higher than all but two other presidents since Eisenhower.\nBut Obama has had some specific complaints lobbed at him regarding his ability to work with others; some of them are fair points.\nOne thing that can be said for Obama is that of all the presidents in the last 60 years, he has the lowest high, although not the lowest low."}
