Gerald Harlon Dobson, a retired state trooper from New Jersey, sat with his wife, Joann, dressed in their festive Hawaiian clothes directly across from Rene Le Beau\u2019s jump seat. Griffin had been meditating. He felt no fear, even though he could feel how unusually fast the plane was going. \u201cAnd when we hit the runway,\u201d Griffin recalled, \u201cmy seat belt pops.\u201d He was stunned for a second, free in his seat, and he turned to look at Michael Kielbassa on his right.\n\n\u201cIf this is as bad as it gets,\u201d Griffin said, \u201cwe\u2019ll be okay.\u201d\n\nIt took but a second. When he turned to look forward toward Le Beau, as he later recalled, \u201cthe plane\u2019s disintegrating. Everything\u2019s starting to turn gray, because of the particles and whatever parts of the plane are falling apart. And it\u2019s getting hard to breathe.\u201d The cockpit was separating from the rest of the plane, and angels of fire were roaring around the open tube of the fuselage, even as the first class cabin began tearing away from the remainder of the craft. As fire bloomed in the air, it consumed all the oxygen. Griffin could feel himself suffocating and could feel the air heating up around him, as the fire from the fuel spraying out behind him moved forward and expanded into a deflagrating cloud. Looking ahead, he could distinguish less and less of the structure of the airplane, as the identifiable parts\u2014the bulkhead, the galley, the jump seats for the flight attendants\u2014 were being transformed into dust. Griffin watched it all with detachment.\n\nThen he was launched into flight. \u201cI\u2019m free in the air. When that plane breaks into pieces, I\u2019m thrown out of the plane and I see the fire. And as I\u2019m leaving the plane, I think, \u2018If I go in that fire, I\u2019ll be a dead man.\u2019 \u201d He believes that he traveled 150 or 200 yards. \u201cI land in a cornfield, and I\u2019m unconscious for a minute or so\u2014maybe two minutes, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019d worn sandals, and I\u2019m feeling this coolness on my feet, and I go, \u2018Oh, that feels good.\u2019 \u201d He didn\u2019t yet know that he had broken the bones in his feet. His feet had also sustained second-and third-degree burns from passing through the cloud of fire. \u201cAnd I go, \u2018No, that\u2019s fuel, stand up.\u2019 And I stand right up, and I look around. The plane\u2019s far from me. And I go, \u2018Well, what should I do now?\u2019 And my brain just said, \u2018Go in slow motion. Just lie down.\u2019 I lie down, and I hear people yelling for help around me. And I yell for help.\u201d\n\nGreg Clapper had left his wife, Jody, and his daughters, Laura and Jenna, in the car on the side of the highway after urging them to go back to the mall to see Peter Pan. They watched Clapper run down the shoulder toward the airport half a mile distant, and then Jody pulled out into traffic and drove away. Clapper ran on for a time, reflecting on how little he knew about the mission he had set for himself. He had his PhD from Emory University and was teaching at Westmar College a few miles up the road in Le Mars. He was the chaplain for the Air National Guard. But he had no real-life experience to prepare him for an event of this magnitude. All at once, he was filled with misgivings about his role. He had been to Garrett-Evangelical Theological Seminary at Northwestern University, but he hadn\u2019t even been to the military chaplain school yet. He was merely an ordained minister. What resources could he fall back on? What help might he bring?\n\nHe stopped running. He looked toward the east at the angry vortex of smoke and debris. He threw his hands up to heaven and said, \u201cLord, make me an instrument of your peace and help me to be your servant here.\u201d And then on he ran toward whatever tasks awaited him. He knew that the situation would be bad. At the least, he\u2019d be dealing with people who were severely shaken from the task of retrieving the dead.\n\nHe reached the gate and introduced himself to Chuck Sundberg, the director of Siouxland Health Services, the ambulance company for the local area.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re here,\u201d Sundberg said, and offered his hand. When they shook hands, a look of surprise crossed Sundberg\u2019s face. \u201cWow,\u201d he said. \u201cI just got goose bumps shaking your hand.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know, this isn\u2019t the kind of thing you can prove,\u201d Clapper said many years later, \u201cbut part of me wants to think, somehow, that holy spirit that I asked to come into my life was palpably noticeable to Chuck when we shook hands.\u201d\n\nSundberg quickly prepared an ID for Clapper and recruited someone to drive him onto the field. Within minutes, he was walking through a scene that was beyond anything he could have imagined. Papers were blowing everywhere, and the sunny day had turned gloomy and overcast and gray with ash and smoke. Streamers of computer tape had come loose from the spools that had been packed in the luggage bay and now made shimmering serpents around his ankles as he walked. He squinted to make sense of the scene. Across the runway he went, stepping around a bank of seats in which the people lay beyond all hope. He passed the dead in all their ranks, in all their spectral attitudes. Some lay supine, mouths open in attitudes of near ecstasy, one upon the next, embracing. Some had bowed their heads as if in deep meditation or prayer. Others had been ground to pulp against the concrete and conveyed no expression at all. Clapper stepped off the far side of the runway and saw what was clearly a human form lying at the edge of the corn where the body had evidently smashed the stalks flat on impact.\n\nClapper crossed to the form and knelt. The man was not only alive, he was conscious. He was also badly injured.\n\nClapper asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d\n\n\u201cBrad,\u201d Griffin said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the chaplain, Brad. Just keep breathing in God\u2019s spirit, and people are going to be here to help you.\u201d\n\n*\n\nWhen the command to brace came, Susan White and the other flight attendants took up the chorus: \u201cBrace! Brace! Brace!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd as I\u2019m yelling it,\u201d White recalled, \u201cI\u2019m saying the Lord\u2019s Prayer in my head and focusing on the bright light, the tunnel\u2014that swirling tunnel that takes you to heaven\u2014the harps and everything peaceful that I had imagined heaven to be like.\u201d She looked out the window and saw that they were passing through a layer of clouds, so fluffy, so white, so beautiful, and she felt her love of flying once more. \u201cRight before impact, I said, \u2018Okay, I\u2019m in your hands, Lord.\u2019 And I had no fear at all. No fear. I took a deep breath. . . .\u201d And then she felt the devastating concussion and saw through the porthole in her exit door that a ball of fire had engulfed the plane. \u201cAnd I calmly said to myself, \u2018I\u2019m burning to death. That\u2019s how I\u2019m dying.\u2019 And the fire was there. And then we started tumbling, and three times I remember it hitting on my door.\u201d\n\nThe flight attendants always locked the bathrooms before landing so that someone trying to escape wouldn\u2019t walk in there by mistake and die. Now as she watched, the lavatory doors exploded open, and the blue water from the toilets spewed out into her face and across her chest and legs. As the separated tail screamed along the runway, metal grinding concrete, \u201cI thought, \u2018Oh, gosh, how many people went to the bathroom in there?\u2019 And I could hear the tanks: Clunk! Clunk! Clunk! I have my hands on my head, my legs are up in the air, as we\u2019re tumbling around, and it was kind of . . . I don\u2019t know, I would describe it as being in a tornado with the amount of soot and dirt that we were scraping up, and then pieces of metal were just flying around the plane. Something came and hit my leg and my butt and it tore my pants and sliced my shoe. I left my eyes open, because I wanted to block everything that was coming my way to protect myself.\u201d The fire she had seen was gone now, and she fleetingly wondered where it went. She could see Martha Conant to her left, but she could not yet see what Conant would see when the tail came to rest. Since Susan was facing aft, she couldn\u2019t see that the plane\u2014the entire plane\u2014was gone. \u201cI kept saying to myself, \u2018Hang on, Hang on,\u2019 as I\u2019m battling, and all of a sudden it was silent, and it just hit me, Oh, my gosh, I\u2019m alive!\u201d She immediately reverted to her training and began shouting, \u201cRelease your seat belts and get out! Release your seat belts and get out!\u201d\n\nRunway 17-35 formed a complex intersection where it met the old Runway 04-22 and Taxiway Lima. When the tail snapped off, it went rocketing down Runway 22 and came to rest at that intersection, mostly on the concrete of Taxiway Lima but with its open end on the grass easement. It had come to a stop on its side, tilted at an angle so that Dave Randa and his mother were suspended twelve feet or so above the torn and jagged metal of the hull. Still strapped into their seats, they were leaning sharply to their right, \u201clooking down into scrap metal,\u201d as Dave put it. \u201cAnd the only way down is to jump.\u201d Looking forward he saw a seat, \u201cmaybe two, and then a bunch of mangled metal. And daylight.\u201d Despite the impact, the scraping and plowing and tumbling of this fragment of the aircraft, the row immediately ahead of him was intact, but beyond that, everyone was gone, the seats all gone. Susan White continued to shout, \u201cRelease your seat belts and get ut! Release your seat belts and get out!\u201d\n\nSusan Randa said, \u201cI remember opening my eyes and thinking, \u2018Oh, my God, we\u2019re alive. How could we be alive?\u2019 \u201d But she saw \u201cabsolutely nothing. It was just gray. There was no space, I don\u2019t remember the seat. I remember Dave there. I still had my arm around him. But I did not know that we were up in the air.\u201d A second, two seconds, may have passed when, hearing White\u2019s words, Dave\u2019s mother released her seat belt as directed. The boy watched his mother\u2019s body recede in slow motion, growing smaller as she went. She landed in the jagged metal below.\n\nDave later said, \u201cI look around, asking, All right, what\u2019s going on? My mom dropped. She stood up and looked at me.\u201d\n\nOn the way down, she hit something, \u201cand I hope to this day that I didn\u2019t hurt anyone,\u201d Susan Randa said. She rose unsteadily to her feet. \u201cAnd then I looked up, and I just saw Dave up there so high, and he had this blue shirt on, and all I could see was gray, plus his blue shirt, and I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh, my God, you left your kid up there. How are you gonna get him down?\u2019 \u201d Susan Randa\u2019s eyes would sometimes turn flame red as we talked. But when she spoke of leaving her son, she broke down and wept in the restaurant where we sat talking.\n\nShe called up to Dave, warning him to hold on before releasing his seat belt. The boy was athletic, big for his age. He braced against the seats and positioned himself so that he could drop feet first. His mother stepped back so that he could fall where she had fallen. She watched as he maneuvered, hung for a moment, and then let go. \u201cThank God, he did it,\u201d she said. Some of the torn metal cut his ankle, but he was otherwise unhurt.\n\n\u201cSo we\u2019re in the metal,\u201d Dave said. \u201cWe\u2019re walking through metal. We see daylight.\u201d Dave and his mother stepped out into a blaze of sunlight. They saw a fire truck grumbling at idle nearby. They walked fifty feet or so to the truck, and Susan asked the fire fighter, \u201cWhere should we go?\u201d\n\n\u201cGo back in there and help those people,\u201d he said, clearly unaware that she was from inside the plane and not some wandering volunteer. Susan held Dave\u2019s hand and led him to a lighted sign on the taxiway. It was a metal box about thigh high with translucent illuminated panels. The markings on it meant nothing to her. She and Dave sat on the sign and watched the people come and go. As they waited in the midst of the unfolding catastrophe, Dave complained to his mother that he had lost his favorite Cubs hat and lamented the fact that they might miss the game.\n\nNearly a quarter of a century after the crash, Susan Randa told her son, \u201cAll I could think of when you said that, was \u2018OMG, you\u2019re lucky to have your head.\u2019 Fortunately my parenting skills were working to the max that day and I said nothing. Still makes me laugh when I think of it.\u201d\n\nDave told her, \u201cWhat can I say, Mom? I started young with good priorities. . . .\u201d He wanted to get to a Cubs game.\n\n*\n\nIn those first few seconds of silence after the tail came to a stop, as Susan White was shouting for people to release their belts, she could not release her own. She was trapped. \u201cI kept grabbing and grabbing and grabbing, and it wasn\u2019t releasing.\u201d Her every action was reflex from her training. But the jump seats on this particular aircraft had latch mechanisms that were different from the one she had used in training. She deliberately stopped herself to take stock of her situation. She was soaked with septic blue toilet water. The visual cues before her, the lavatory doors, were straight, and yet she felt as if gravity wanted to pull her at an odd angle to her left, and not down toward her feet as it had always done before. Concentrating on the task, she looked down at the clasp on her harness and realized that it was a different attachment. Now that she was focused, she was able to rotate the clasp. The belts released. She hung in her harness, still at that odd angle. She hooked her left arm into the shoulder strap and swung her leg around the way gravity took it. Thus dangling from her harness like a circus aerialist high above the crowd, she planted her left foot on her jump seat and braced her right foot on the magazine rack. Now she saw for the first time that the plane was gone. She had fully expected to turn and see the familiar cabin and all her people, but there was nothing. She saw seats torn asunder, people dangling, people falling, but no airplane. She saw Dave and Susan Randa below, departing across the grass. White had no memory of seeing John Hatch. Then as she was preparing to release herself and drop, she saw that a man was trapped beneath a piece of metal below her. He couldn\u2019t get out. If she let go, she\u2019d fall on him and crush him further. Someone, a woman, was with him. It was most likely the couple who had been sitting next to Martha Conant, Karl and Marilyn Walter of Denver.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In 1989, United 232 crash-landed, splintered apart and burst into flames: 184 of 296 people lived.
