But he also knows he cannot simply instill confidence into his players. They have to figure it out on their own.\n\nThat\u2019s why this calendar year has been a big boost for a team looking to qualify for its first bowl game since the 2007 Independence Bowl. They, in fact, are figuring it out.\n\n\u201cI hear them talking, or they come to me and say, \u2018Hey coach, what\u2019s our schedule for Christmas, for a bowl?\u2019 \u201d MacIntyre said. \u201cThey haven\u2019t asked me that before. So, they feel that. Now, we\u2019ve got to go do it, but until they see it in their mind\u2019s eye I can\u2019t make them see it. I can mention it, but I can\u2019t make them see it. They have to do it.\u201d\n\nAnd by all accounts, they are.\n\nColorado is coming from a difficult space \u2014 just six wins in the last two seasons, one win in the Pac-12 in the last two seasons and just one win against a team from a Power 5 conference in that span. But in their view, the mountain to go from last season\u2019s 2-10 to the seven wins needed to qualify for a bowl this year isn\u2019t as steep as it appears.\n\nFirst, there were the four losses by five or fewer points last season. Two of those losses \u2014 at Cal, and home against UCLA \u2014 were in double overtime. Win those, and this season simply looks like the next step rather than a Grand Canyon-sized leap from two to seven wins.\n\nLate-game mistakes were a staple of last year\u2019s team, so attention to detail will be key for this year\u2019s Buffs.\n\nExperience is quickly fading as an issue. CU returns experience with 14 starters (six on offense, eight on defense) and 25 other players who have started a game at least once. In addition, and perhaps most importantly, a bigger, stronger Buffs team has injected some of that confidence that MacIntyre says he sees.\n\nThe CU coach said he\u2019s seen the attitude of his bunch go from: \u2018Who can we beat?\u2019 to \u2018Who can beat us?\u2019\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the mind-set this year: Who can beat us?\u201d senior offensive tackle Stephane Nembot said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we see ourselves going to a bowl game. You can\u2019t be going to battle expecting to not come back. When you go to battle, you\u2019re going to come back and see your family, right? We know how much work we put in.\u201d\n\nSaid junior linebacker Addison Gillam: \u201cEverybody\u2019s gotten bigger, everybody\u2019s gained weight, gotten a lot stronger. I think that just brings confidence with it. I don\u2019t really think a whole lot of people outside of Colorado believe in us, and we kind of wear that chip on our shoulder. We can use it to our advantage.\u201d\n\nCU has already gone through four practices in preseason camp, and MacIntyre says all of the confidence gained from spring drills and summer workouts has carried over to on-field preparation for the regular season.\n\nHe\u2019s not the only one.\n\n\u201cWe challenge each other in practice, ever since the summer,\u201d senior cornerback Ken Crawley said. \u201cWe absolutely have that mentality. If you don\u2019t think you can go out there and play against those guys, you have no confidence. So we go out with the confidence that we can beat anybody in the conference and nonconference.\u201d\n\nChristopher Dempsey: cdempsey@denverpost.com or twitter.com/dempseypost", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado Buffaloes thinking big with a new shot of confidence", "title": "Colorado Buffaloes thinking big with a new shot of confidence", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/08/08/colorado-buffaloes-thinking-big-with-a-new-shot-of-confidence/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150808_032745_sefo-liufau.jpg", "height": 456}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150808_032745_sefo-liufau.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-08T15:30:13+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T09:10:26+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "University of Colorado"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI hear them talking, or they come to me and say, \u2018Hey coach, what\u2019s our schedule for Christmas, for a bowl?\u2019 \u201d MacIntyre said.\nSo we go out with the confidence that we can beat anybody in the conference and nonconference.\u201dChristopher Dempsey: cdempsey@denverpost.com or twitter.com/dempseypost\nIn addition, and perhaps most importantly, a bigger, stronger Buffs team has injected some of that confidence that MacIntyre says he sees.\nIf you don\u2019t think you can go out there and play against those guys, you have no confidence.\nThat\u2019s why this calendar year has been a big boost for a team looking to qualify for its first bowl game since the 2007 Independence Bowl."}
