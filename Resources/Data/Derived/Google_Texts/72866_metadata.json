It was a warning sign, for sure, to say, \u2018Hey, wake up and look after what you\u2019re doing.\u2019 But that won\u2019t affect the way I work or the way I coach.\u201d\n\nA career college coach who spent 10 years as head coach at the University of California, Tedford was an NFL rookie whose plans in Tampa called for him to install an up-tempo attack similar to that run by Chip Kelly in Philadelphia.\n\nMost of the elements of his scheme were lost during his absence, however, and the Bucs have suffered as a result. With NFL rookie quarterbacks coach Marcus Arroyo taking on the added role of play caller, the Bucs (2-12) have struggled to move the ball and score points.\n\nThey will go into their game Sunday against Green Bay today ranked 30th overall in the 32-team in league in total offense (305.9 yards per game), including 29th in rushing (84.0 ypg), 18th in passing (221.9 ypg) and 27th in points per game (18.1).\n\nIn other Bucs news, the team on Saturday placed safety Major Wright on season-ending injured reserve and promoted cornerback C.J. Wilson from their practice squad to the 53-man roster.\n\nWright had already been declared out for Sunday\u2019s game against the Packers with a rib injury. He became the fourth player placed on IR by the Bucs this week, joining defensive tackle Gerald McCoy (knee), tight end Austin Seferian-Jenkins (back) and wide receiver Louis Murphy (ankle).\n\nrcummings@tampatrib.com\n\n(813) 259-7979\n\nTwitter: @RcummingsTBO", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sat, 20 Dec 2014 13:32:04 -0400", "Description": "TAMPA \u2014 Former Tampa Bay Buccaneers offensive coordinator Jeff Tedford indicated Friday that he was healthy enough to resume his coaching duties with the team as far back as October.", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "TAMPA \u2014 Former Tampa Bay Buccaneers offensive coordinator Jeff Tedford indicated Friday that he was healthy enough to resume his coaching duties with the team as far back as October.", "title": "Tedford: Was healthy enough to coach Bucs in October", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/sports/bucs/tedford-was-healthy-enough-to-coach-bucs-in-october-20141220/", "image": {"width": 4000, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20141220/ARTICLE/141229956/EP/1/2/EP-141229956.jpg", "height": 2672}, "updated_time": "2014-12-20T18:26:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "TAMPA \u2014 Former Tampa Bay Buccaneers offensive coordinator Jeff Tedford indicated Friday that he was healthy enough to resume his coaching duties with the team as far back as October.", "title": "Tedford: Was healthy enough to coach Bucs in October", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20141220/ARTICLE/141229956/AR/0/AR-141229956.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2014-12-20T13:32:04Z-04", "modified_time": "2014-12-20T18:26:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8601\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIt was a temporary setback where I had a little heart issue and I had two stents put in,\u201d Tedford told Vancouver-area reports.\n\u2014 Former Tampa Bay Buccaneers offensive coordinator Jeff Tedford indicated Friday that he was healthy enough to resume his coaching duties with the team as far back as October.\nIn other Bucs news, the team on Saturday placed safety Major Wright on season-ending injured reserve and promoted cornerback C.J.\nTedford last ran the Bucs\u2019 offense during an Aug. 23 preseason game in Buffalo, but a heart procedure performed two days later resulted in Tedford asking for and receiving an indefinite leave of absence on Sept. 23.\nWith NFL rookie quarterbacks coach Marcus Arroyo taking on the added role of play caller, the Bucs (2-12) have struggled to move the ball and score points."}
