The state of Texas has announced that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) have agreed to extend the Medicaid Transformation waiver. I’m glad the Administration has agreed to provide health care providers continued flexibility to design the state’s Medicaid program in a way that best meets the individual needs of Texans. However, only by repealing Obamacare and modernizing our nation’s entitlement programs will we ultimately be able to lower costs, increase the quality of care, and preserve the patient-doctor relationship for Texas families.

In November of 2015, Senator Cornyn led a letter to Health and Human Services Department Secretary Sylvia Burwell in support of extending the Section 1115 waiver for Texans, citing the important relationship that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services share with health care providers across the state.
