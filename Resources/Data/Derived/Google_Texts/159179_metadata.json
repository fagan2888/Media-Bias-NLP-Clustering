This was a strange turn of events for me, a woman who at various stages of life has been described as a commie pinko, a bleeding heart liberal and a vegan, un-American Femi-Nazi. And yet, I not only hooked up with this guy; I started a relationship with him and stayed with him for almost a decade. He was a punk dude I met in the grocery store, a wily intense artist. These days I\u2019m thinking of him\u2013and his flag\u2014to try to figure out the people in the crowds cheering for Donald Trump.\n\nThe first time I walked into this guy\u2019s living room, I got an eyeful of that huge, red, hateful symbol, and stood stock-still, eyes wide. I felt every muscle in my body tense. I felt nauseous and confused. I had been considering kissing this guy. He had made me laugh, and now I would unfortunately have to first hold an intimate teach-in for one and then set his living room on fire.\n\n\u201cDude,\u201d I said. \u201cThat is so fucked up that you have that hanging on the wall. That\u2019s so racist.\u201d I could feel my dream of a perfect alterna-boyfriend shattering, my crush withering inside me. In vivid detail, I prepared the arguments I\u2019d used against racist white people throughout my life. I felt myself tensing for the battles I\u2019d experienced at anti-Klan demonstrations in Boston and anti-Nazi demonstrations in Minneapolis and arguments with racist relatives around the holiday dinner table. I\u2019d always loved the underdog\u2014whether it was a cause or a sweetheart\u2014and that trait definitely delivered its share of adventures.\n\nThis guy, whom I\u2019ll call Abe, looked at me with a mixture of horror and consternation. \u201cI found it in a Dumpster,\u201d he said. \u201cI just thought\u2014oh, badass. Like Dukes of Hazzard and the General Lee.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s right. He had just turned 30, and he had absolutely no idea what the Confederate flag actually represented. For him it was an accessory, a decoration, not a symbol of hundreds of years of racial violence and brutality. This might seem hard to believe; it certainly was for me. But I also remembered a time back in my childhood when the General Lee was just a car with doors that didn\u2019t open right. I stood there in his living room and thought about all the times I had needed someone else to stand in front of me with a scowl, to tell me something I thought was messed up\u2014and then to decide to stay and talk with me about it. At the time, I felt like it was finally my turn. Now, when I look back on this unlikely romance, I feel something else unexpected; I feel like I have a window into the mind of the kind of man who makes up Donald Trump\u2019s voting base.\n\nBack before I met Abe, I was a bookish nerd in college, but also an anarchist and a labor activist. Even as I studied radical democratic theory in anarchist study groups, clutching my crumpled photocopies of articles by Paulo Freire and Saul Alinsky and Pierre Bourdieu, I thought hard about my family\u2019s own background in Europe and in this country, where lack of education had consistently denied every person a chance to pursue a career or develop intellectual interests. The first women in my family to get college degrees were my aunts, who did so courtesy of the convent. My dad was the first man to get a degree, and my mom got her GED after immigrating to the U.S. I thought about what it meant to have descended from German miners on both sides of my family and from a butcher in rural Arkansas. Because my entire family was of German descent, it felt all the more urgent that I think about the appeal of fascism in all its forms.\n\nAbe was like many of the members of my own family in that he worked with his hands and hadn\u2019t been to college. His high school experience was not especially rigorous, either, and he was decidedly labeled a \u201cbad kid,\u201d not \u201ccollege material.\u201d He was raised in a conservative, religious, single-parent household at the edge of poverty. But from the first conversation I had with him, I could see that he was intelligent, quick-witted and introspective. I fell immediately in love with him, and I think part of why I did so was that I felt at home with him, with his rough story that somehow reflected the story of my own family.\n\nWhen he told me that first day that he hung up the Confederate flag because it seemed \u201cbadass,\u201d I swallowed my nausea and decided to see if he would change. The next time I came over, the flag was down. He said, with honest forthrightness, that he\u2019d had no idea how offensive it was.\n\nI believed him. He worked in a wood mill with immigrants from Somalia and Russia and interacted on a daily basis with a much more diverse cast of characters than I did in my safe, homogenous graduate school classrooms.\n\nHe\u2019d thought about what I\u2019d said, and he took down the flag. And then he thanked me for explaining everything without making him feel like shit.\n\nOnly, I kind of did make him feel like shit, at least in my book. I wanted to make sure he understood that this was important. In response, he could have told me to go to hell, but instead he thought about everything I told him.\n\nNow, I\u2019m not saying that every racist is an innocent who needs to be understood and humored. I believe\u2014because I\u2019ve seen it in my own family\u2014that some racists are hardened and unteachable. I\u2019ve had conversations where I was reduced to staring in open-mouthed horror as I realized that common ground was a fantasy, that the other person seemed to take delight in his or her extreme views. Abe was not that way; he honestly didn\u2019t know enough about history. But from this place of not-knowing, he was looking for any symbols of rebellion he could find. He drove a loud muscle car, listened to punk and heavy metal at ear-shredding decibels, and wore a jean jacket vest covered with patches. At night we snuggled together to watch movies, he wanted to show me the world that he cared about, the men he\u2019d chosen as cinematic replacement fathers: Dennis Hopper in \u201cEasy Rider,\u201d Al Pacino in \u201cScarface,\u201d Clint Eastwood in everything. Guys who went out with guns blazing.\n\nAs a rebel myself, I think a lot about the few ways that working-class people have left to express their outrage. I came to my politics via anger at the status quo, but it was often hard to find spaces to let loose and express that anger. I\u2019d lived in a vegan co-op where I had never felt pure enough with my dietary choices, and then I\u2019d gone through several years where I could never reach my ideals as a responsible, engaged citizen. I didn\u2019t go to all the meetings I felt I should have, I bought the grapes during the boycott, and I used the Amnesty International address labels without sending in a donation. Political virtue seemed like an endless list I could never complete. Maybe that was why it was so satisfying and necessary to find movements and moments, here and there, where I could metaphorically set things on fire: string angry sentences into a microphone, yell myself hoarse outside the house of a strike-breaking business owner, or get together with hundreds of other people to block a street and stop traffic. Those actions fit with my principals. Plus, stepping far outside the status quo delivered a jolt of raw adrenaline. I found those fellow loudmouths through what I\u2019d learned around college campuses, and Abe hadn\u2019t fallen into those circles of organized rebellion.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Our affair gave me many things -- including insight into the appeal of the \"outlaw\" for working-class, white men", "title": "I slept with the enemy: Here\u2019s what an unlikely romance taught me about racism, Donald Trump, and our cultural obsession with male rebellion", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Our affair gave me many things -- including insight into the appeal of the \"outlaw\" for working-class, white men", "title": "I slept with the enemy: Here\u2019s what an unlikely romance taught me about racism, Donald Trump, and our cultural obsession with male rebellion", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/03/20/i_slept_with_the_enemy_heres_what_an_unlikely_romance_taught_me_about_racism_donald_trump_and_our_cultural_obsession_with_male_rebellion/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/03/donald_trump_general_lee.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Our affair gave me many things -- including insight into the appeal of the \"outlaw\" for working-class, white men", "title": "I slept with the enemy: Here\u2019s what an unlikely romance taught me about racism, Donald Trump, and our cultural obsession with male rebellion", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/03/donald_trump_general_lee.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Sonya Huber", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Donald Trump, Editor's Picks, Elections 2016, Life stories", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The first time I walked into this guy\u2019s living room, I got an eyeful of that huge, red, hateful symbol, and stood stock-still, eyes wide.\nHe had made me laugh, and now I would unfortunately have to first hold an intimate teach-in for one and then set his living room on fire.\nTopics: Donald Trump, Editor's Picks, Elections 2016, Life stories, Life NewsI once loved a man who hung a huge Confederate flag on his living room wall.\nThese days I\u2019m thinking of him\u2013and his flag\u2014to try to figure out the people in the crowds cheering for Donald Trump.\nI found those fellow loudmouths through what I\u2019d learned around college campuses, and Abe hadn\u2019t fallen into those circles of organized rebellion."}
