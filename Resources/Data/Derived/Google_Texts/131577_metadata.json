Sukuk would also allow any issuer to access both conventional and Islamic investors, important when regional liquidity has been reduced by governments drawing on their reserves.\n\nQatar has already borrowed $5.5 billion through a bank loan concluded earlier this month and the institutions which supported this deal are expected to be among the favorites to secure the coveted arranger mandates.\n\nBank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Mizuho, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp, Deutsche Bank, Barclays and Qatar National Bank arranged the loan.\n\n($1 = 3.6412 Qatar riyals)\n\n(Additional Reporting by Tom Finn in Doha; Editing by Dominic Evans)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "DUBAI (Reuters) - The government of Qatar is in talks with banks about a sovereign suk", "title": "Exclusive: Qatar in talks for sovereign sukuk issue as early as March - sources", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/01/25/Exclusive-Qatar-talks-sovereign-sukuk-issue-early-March-sources", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/qatar_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/01/25/Exclusive-Qatar-talks-sovereign-sukuk-issue-early-March-sources", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/qatar_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "DUBAI (Reuters) - The government of Qatar is in talks with banks about a sovereign suk", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "EXPECTATIONSShould Qatar tap the debt market, it would be the first time since it priced a $4 billion two-part sukuk issue in July 2012.\nDUBAI (Reuters) - The government of Qatar is in talks with banks about a sovereign sukuk issue, sources aware of the matter said on Monday, as the Gulf nation returns to international debt markets to shore up state finances pressured by low energy prices.\nThe source added that a sukuk issue would be the most likely route, should the government issue debt, because the liquidity in the Islamic banking system was better than within the conventional banking market.\nThe government may issue the dollar-denominated sukuk as soon as March or April, two of the sources added, speaking on condition of anonymity as the information is private.\nBank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Mizuho, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp, Deutsche Bank, Barclays and Qatar National Bank arranged the loan."}
