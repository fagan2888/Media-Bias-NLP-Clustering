TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — A Chinese-French film about blind masseurs and Chinese actor and director Chen Jianbin scooped the most accolades at Taiwan’s 51st Golden Horse movie awards.

“Blind Massage” from Chinese director Lou Ye won six of the seven categories it had been nominated in at the Chinese-language equivalent of the Oscars, including best feature film. The film is about workers in a massage parlor in China’s Nanjing city.

The other big winner Saturday evening was Chen, who won best lead actor and best new director for “A Fool” as well as best supporting actor for his role in Taiwanese military drama “Paradise in Service.”

Ann Hui won her third best director award for “The Golden Era” at the awards ceremony in Taipei.
