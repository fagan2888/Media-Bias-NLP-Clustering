He was brought to the federal courthouse in downtown Cincinnati under tight security from the jail some 30 miles away where he\u2019s been held since after his arrest Wednesday outside a gun shop.\n\nCornell planned to \u201cwage jihad\u201d by attacking the Capitol with pipe bombs and shooting government officials and employees, the FBI said in court documents.\n\n\u201cI feel that the danger to the community is such that I cannot order bond today,\u201d Bowman said, noting that messages attributed by federal authorities to Cornell had him discussing extreme violence.\n\nShe agreed with the recommendation by Tim Mangan, an assistant U.S. attorney, who called Cornell a flight risk and a danger to the community for allegedly creating the kind of terrorist plot that \u201cis the most pressing threat to our public safety.\u201d\n\nAn assistant federal public defender, Karen Savir, had asked that Cornell be released with electronic monitoring to his parents\u2019 apartment in suburban Cincinnati. She said he had no history of serious trouble and didn\u2019t even have a passport.\n\nShe added that he was \u201ceager to appear in court\u201d to defend against the allegations.\n\nShe also told Bowman that Cornell wants to be addressed by his Muslim name, Raheel Mahrus Ubaydah, and have access to a prayer mat and a clock so that he can continue his religious practices in the Butler County Jail. He also wants to be taken off suicide watch, she said.\n\nWearing county jail clothing with orange-and-white stripes and in ankle shackles, Cornell spoke quietly at the defense table with Savir. His parents and other family members were in the front row and were warned to be quiet after shouts including \u201cLove you, Chris!\u201d\n\nCornell\u2019s father, John Cornell, has said his son was set up by a \u201csnitch\u201d who was trying to help himself. He described his son as a \u201cmommy\u2019s boy\u201d who spent hours playing video games in his bedroom. He also said his son was \u201cat peace\u201d after becoming a practicing Muslim.\n\n\u201cHe was dragged into this,\u201d Cornell said before the hearing. \u201cHe was coerced.\u201d\n\nHis son had long expressed distrust of government and the news media, and local police said he disrupted a 9/11 memorial ceremony in 2013.\n\nThe FBI said he had for months sent social media messages and posted video espousing support for Islamic State militants and for violent attacks by others. Cornell told an informant they should \u201cwage jihad,\u201d authorities said in court papers.\n\nSimilar stings in recent years have led to accusations of entrapment. But the FBI has argued such stings are vital for averting deadly terror attacks, and juries have returned tough sentences.\n\nIt was unclear from court papers if Cornell had made contact with any terrorist groups.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Jennifer Smola and Mitch Stacy in Columbus, Ohio, and Eric Tucker in Washington contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nContact Dan Sewell at http://www.twitter.com/dansewell", "article_metadata": {"description": "A 20-year-old Ohio man charged with plotting an attack at the U.S. Capitol was ordered held without bond Friday after a federal magistrate concluded he was a danger to the community.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A 20-year-old Ohio man charged with plotting an attack at the U.S. Capitol was ordered held without bond Friday after a federal magistrate concluded he was a danger to the community.", "title": "Christopher Lee Cornell, Ohio man accused in Capitol terror plot, held without bond", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jan/16/ohio-terror-defendant-due-for-first-court-appearan/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/14/7af7f5966a6541026b0f6a706700f499.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/14/7af7f5966a6541026b0f6a706700f499.jpg", "description": "A 20-year-old Ohio man charged with plotting an attack at the U.S. Capitol was ordered held without bond Friday after a federal magistrate concluded he was a danger to the community.", "card": "summary", "title": "Christopher Lee Cornell, Ohio man accused in Capitol terror plot, held"}, "Author": "Dan Sewell", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Christopher Lee Cornell, Cornell University, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Stephanie Bowman, Cincinnati"}, "article_summary": "Christopher Lee Cornell appeared before U.S. Magistrate Judge Stephanie Bowman in a brief detention hearing Friday afternoon.\nCornell planned to \u201cwage jihad\u201d by attacking the Capitol with pipe bombs and shooting government officials and employees, the FBI said in court documents.\nCINCINNATI \u2014 A 20-year-old Ohio man charged with plotting an attack at the U.S. Capitol was ordered held without bond Friday after a federal magistrate concluded he was a danger to the community.\nWearing county jail clothing with orange-and-white stripes and in ankle shackles, Cornell spoke quietly at the defense table with Savir.\n___Associated Press writers Jennifer Smola and Mitch Stacy in Columbus, Ohio, and Eric Tucker in Washington contributed to this report."}
