Ken Bardon nearly three years. He and his crew set sail in January of 2013, and Bardon returned home to Marco on Saturday.\n\n\"It's sort of been a life dream,\" Bardon said. \"The reality is, the journey was the favorite part.\"\n\nHe sold his company and retired in 2012, but the new year sparked a new adventure.\n\n\"He didn't break out a bottle of champagne. He didn't call up everybody to celebrate. He went onto the internet and ordered cruising guides for the South Pacific,\" said his wife, Lil.\n\nKen said he's \"not a do-nothing, sit-down type of person.\"\n\nSo, he set sail Jan. 13, 2013, with four friends.\n\n\"It's a rhythm that you get into, that you follow. You're with people that you don't live with, but you make a family together,\" said Nancy Devries, one of Bardon's crewmembers.\n\nThe sailboat became their home. It traveled from Marco to Tahiti to Fiji.\n\n\"We spent almost four weeks in Fiji. Wonderful place. Lots of friends visited us. We went diving. Fiji to New Zealand, and that was the end of year one.\"\n\nEveryone made their own plans - to stay for the next leg of the journey or to reconnect in a different place.\n\n\"Ken is amazing at orchestrating arrivals and being where we need to be,\" Lil said. \"It was seamless. It was perfect.\"\n\nKen made it a point to be home for the holidays while his boat waited for him. He sailed for two more years, hitting Thailand, Turkey and Italy, just to name a few.\n\nThen, he was homeward bound with his original crew for a perfect homecoming.\n\nKen said he plans to get more involved in his community and do something \"important\" next.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "A Marco Island man's lifelong dream has been fulfilled after he sailed around the world.
