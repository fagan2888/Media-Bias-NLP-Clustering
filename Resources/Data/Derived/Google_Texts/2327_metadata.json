But she added that the medical home is a \u201cmoving target\u201d that continues to evolve. A new NCQA white paper (PDF) , she said, describes other studies that have found the medical home can improve quality, patient experience, continuity of care and disease management while lowering hospital admissions and emergency department visits.NCQA medical home recognition is being used in primary-care improvement initiatives in 37 states and the District of Columbia. In 14 of those states, the initiatives are private-payer efforts and in seven they operate under public programs. Seventeen states have both private and public health plans involved.The NCQA recognition program has been criticized, however, for relying too much on process or structural measures and not enough on outcomes.The NCQA recognition program has been criticized for relying too much on process or structural measures and not enough on outcomes.\u201cThe NCQA PCMH survey should never be used by itself to assess a true patient-centered medical home, and should never be the basis for rewarding practices,\u201d Francois de Brantes, executive director of the Health Care Incentives Improvement Institute, wrote in a blog post responding to the recent JAMA study. \u201cIn fact, its usefulness has run its course. In an age of wide adoption of (electronic medical records) and registries, the focus of incentives has to shift entirely to the results of the care provided. We've already lost enough time on this. No need to lose any more.\u201dThe NCQA acknowledges this argument in its new white paper and notes that \u201cworking toward measuring outcomes in PCMHs is a top NCQA priority,\u201d but that practices often lack the data needed to track hospital admissions and emergency room visits. They may also lack the volume of certain patient types to \u201csupport robust case sampling.\u201d\u201cStructural measures are the best option until we have consensus and good data sources on the best outcome measures for PCMH evaluation,\u201d according to the white paper. \u201cFurther, structural measures are useful as a roadmap that tells practices what they need to do to become PCMHs.\u201dThe NCQA medical home recognition program also came under fire at the March 6 meeting of the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, also known as MedPAC.While acknowledging he was \u201chardly an expert on this,\u201d MedPAC Chairman Glenn Hackbarth said he was worried that the NCQA model had become \u201cgold plated\u201d with \u201ca lot of bells and whistles added.\u201cMy impression is that not all of them have really been validated as adding value, but they add cost,\u201d Hackbarth said.The criticism came up during a discussion on possible replacements for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act's Medicaid parity provision, which reimburses Medicaid primary-care services at Medicare rates for 2013 and 2014. One option discussed was per-beneficiary per-month payments (PDF) \u2014a popular payment method for medical home services.Hackbarth said he was looking for other ways to address concerns about access to primary care without \u201cputting all of our eggs into the medical home basket.\u201dO'Kane, though, stressed that the NCQA's standards for medical homes are a project of great ambition. \u201cWe are trying to change a delivery system,\u201d and doing so requires constant learning, measuring and improving, she said. \u201cThis is a formula that is incredibly powerful.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#0a365e", "description": "The National Committee for Quality Assurance, under increasing pressure to demonstrate the value of its recognition programs, previewed new patient-centered medical home standards intended to put more emphasis on team-based care, integrating behavioral health and sustaining practice transformation.", "title": "Healthcare Reform Update: NCQA previews new medical home standards", "og": {"site_name": "Modern Healthcare", "description": "The National Committee for Quality Assurance, under increasing pressure to demonstrate the value of its recognition programs, previewed new patient-centered medical home standards intended to put more emphasis on team-based care, integrating behavioral health and sustaining practice transformation.", "title": "Healthcare Reform Update: NCQA previews new medical home standards", "url": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20140310/news/303109940", "image": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CH/20140310/NEWS/303109940/AR/0/Margaret-O'Kane.jpg&maxw=1200&maxh=630", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com", "description": "The National Committee for Quality Assurance, under increasing pressure to demonstrate the value of its recognition programs, previewed new patient-centered medical home standards intended to put more emphasis on team-based care, integrating behavioral health and sustaining practice transformation.", "creator": "@modrnhealthcr", "image": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CH/20140310/NEWS/303109940/AR/0/Margaret-O'Kane.jpg&imageversion=thumbnail&maxw=240&maxh=240", "title": "Healthcare Reform Update: NCQA previews new medical home standards", "site": "@modrnhealthcr", "card": "summary"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Modern Healthcare", "published_at": "2014-03-10", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "url": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20140310/news/303109940", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "msapplication-TileImage": "https:/raw.githubusercontent.com/modernhealthcare/mh-logo/master/ms-touch-icon-144x144-precomposed.png", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "image": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CH/20140310/NEWS/303109940/AR/0/Margaret-O'Kane.jpg&maxw=360&maxh=240", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7d5e\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe are trying to change a delivery system,\u201d and doing so requires constant learning, measuring and improving, she said.\nIn 14 of those states, the initiatives are private-payer efforts and in seven they operate under public programs.\nBut she added that the medical home is a \u201cmoving target\u201d that continues to evolve.\nIn an age of wide adoption of (electronic medical records) and registries, the focus of incentives has to shift entirely to the results of the care provided.\n\u201cThis is a formula that is incredibly powerful.\u201d"}
