PHOENIX — Home plate umpire Fieldin Culbreth had to leave a game between the Colorado Rockies and Arizona Diamondbacks on Sunday after being hit in the head by a foul ball.

Culbreth was hit on the left side of his mask in the second inning on a foul by Arizona’s Chris Owings. Culbreth threw a new ball back to Rockies pitcher Jorge De La Rosa, but lingered next to the batter’s box before calling in the rest of the umpires.

Arizona’s trainer came out to check on Culbreth, who walked off the field under his own power. The Diamondbacks said Culbreth suffered a mild concussion.

Jim Reynolds, who had been at first base, took over behind the plate and a three-man crew worked the game.
