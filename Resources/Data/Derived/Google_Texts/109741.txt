This could just as easily be titled "Paparazzo successfully baits Jonah Hill into losing his cool by hurting his feelings about his shorts."

A photographer pestering comedy star Jonah Hill caught him on tape using a homophobic slur on Monday (TMZ has the video). Hill, who was walking with friends in LA, did his best to ignore the paparazzo who was dancing around them and shouting questions at Hill. "I like the shorts though, bro. They're pretty sexy," he said at one point, apparently a swipe at Hill's flowery summer shorts.

Hill eventually lost his cool and yelled "Suck my d---, f-----," at the photographer.

OK, celebrities need to cut this out. Listen up, buddies. (I call all celebrities my buddies.) Buddies, no one cares if you yell insults at a paparazzo. We get it. They're horrible. But why let them bait you into this? Why do so many of you have slurs on the tip of your tongues, just waiting to be teased out by an enterprising pest? You need some insults that only offend the person they're intended to. Maybe go back to Shakespeare. "Suck my d---, knave." "Go f--- yourself, cankerblossom." "Shove it up your ---, you milk-livered pumpion."
