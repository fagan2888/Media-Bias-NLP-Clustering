We have to find better solutions faster,\u201d said Rod Hochman, MD, president and CEO of Providence Health & Services, in a media release. \u201cWe aren\u2019t going to find real change through the traditional lens of health system practices that only improve things incrementally.\u201d\n\nHeading up the venture fund will be Aaron Martin, who recently joined Providence as vice president of strategy and innovation after nine years spent in Amazon\u2019s media unit, including the online retailer\u2019s self-publishing platform.\n\n\u201cConsumers are now comparison shopping, reading reviews and purchasing healthcare online,\u201d said Martin in the media release. \u201cThis trend will only accelerate as it has in every other industry. Consumers will demand more value, quality and convenience from the health care provider they choose just as they do with any other aspect of their lives.\u201d\n\nProvidence leaders do not only want to \u201cbuy ideas but also build innovations,\u201d so the fund will include a digital innovation group led by Mark Long, a former NASA engineer who\u2019s spent the past decade at a range of tech companies, most recently at a clinical decision support start-up and at Amazon\u2019s internal logistics services start-up.\n\nThe digital innovation group will create its own technology and process to collaborate with early-stage companies, customize customer- and clinician-facing platforms and \u201cinnovate in areas where there are gaps,\u201d added Martin. \u201cWe are marrying the cultures of software innovation with healthcare delivery to create big ideas, build them using small-batch innovations and learn quickly in a rigorous, data-driven way.\u201d\n\nPersonalized medicine for all\n\nSeparate from the venture fund, Providence is making another big technology investment \u2013 this one in advanced diagnostics and personalized medicine.\n\nProvidence has hired Patrick Soon-Shiong, MD, as global director for cancer services and bio-informatics, to oversee what is apparently the country\u2019s first clinical genomic network for whole genomic sequencing.\n\nSoon-Shiong, a Los Angeles surgeon who pioneered insulin cell transplants for Type 1 diabetics and became a billionaire after inventing the cancer drug Abraxane, has recently been nurturing his own suite of health information technology and genomic sequencing processes under the holding company NantHealth.\n\nNow, he will be helping bring personalized diagnostics and therapies to Providence cancer patients in Alaska, California, Montana, Oregon and Washington.\n\n\u201cWe are living our commitment to clinicians and patients alike,\u201d said Soon-Shiong in a media release.\n\nUnder Soon-Shiong, Providence says it will be the first provider system to use Illumina\u2019s HiSeq X Ten genome sequencer, able to process thousands of patients\u2019 genomes annually, and the first CLIA-approved facility offering molecular decisions for cancer patients.\n\n\u201cOur opportunity is to fundamentally change how cancer is treated,\u201d said Hochman, Providence\u2019s CEO. \u201cNo longer will cancer treatment be guided simply by a diagnosis. With the leadership of Dr. Soon-Shiong and the many leading oncology clinicians and researchers across our five-state organization, we will have a vast amount of genetic information, technology and science to pinpoint the best care and possible outcomes for patients.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/health-system-launches-tech-fund-genomics-venture", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/modules/open_graph/hfn-stacked.jpeg", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "Rather than waiting for innovation, one health system is looking to nurture its own clinical and technology advances, tapping into Amazon alums and a billionaire surgeon with a big, disruptive vision.", "title": "Health system launches tech fund, genomics venture"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/modules/open_graph/hfn-stacked.jpeg"}, "description": "Rather than waiting for innovation, one health system is looking to nurture its own clinical and technology advances, tapping into Amazon alums and a billionaire surgeon with a big, disruptive vision.", "site": "@HC_Finance", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Health system launches tech fund, genomics venture"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Rather than waiting for innovation from the many solutions vendors on the market, one health system is looking to nurture its own clinical and technology advances.&#13; Providence Health &amp; Services is creating its own $150 million venture capital fund, with the help of a former Amazon executive, while also starting a new genomic medicine program with a billionaire physician and technology entrepreneur.", "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe16df\"", "article_summary": "We have to find better solutions faster,\u201d said Rod Hochman, MD, president and CEO of Providence Health & Services, in a media release.\nNow, he will be helping bring personalized diagnostics and therapies to Providence cancer patients in Alaska, California, Montana, Oregon and Washington.\nRather than waiting for innovation from the many solutions vendors on the market, one health system is looking to nurture its own clinical and technology advances.\nProvidence Health & Services is creating its own $150 million venture capital fund, with the help of a former Amazon executive, while also starting a new genomic medicine program with a billionaire physician and technology entrepreneur.\nProvidence has hired Patrick Soon-Shiong, MD, as global director for cancer services and bio-informatics, to oversee what is apparently the country\u2019s first clinical genomic network for whole genomic sequencing."}
