The Broncos enter their biggest division road game of the season with concerns extending beyond the venue. Denver, like most teams this time of season, is battling injuries at critical positions.

Linebacker Brandon Marshall (concussion) and cornerbacks Aqib Talib (hamstring) and Kayvon Webster (dislocated shoulder) did not practice during the period open to reporters on Wednesday. The Broncos remain optimistic that Marshall will pass the league-mandated concussion protocol and be available to start Sunday against the Chiefs. Talib participated in only 17 plays in the win over the Dolphins as he tried to work through the leg issue.

He is expected to update his condition Wednesday. Webster entered as his backup and was hurt in the fourth quarter. He is less likely to play, leaving Omar Bolden possibly seeing time in nickel packages. From a matchup standpoint, the Broncos could catch a break if compromised in the secondary. The Chiefs lean heavily on the run, and no Kansas City receiver owns a touchdown reception. Tight end Travis Kelce leads Kansas City with four receiving scores.

Julius Thomas (left ankle) warmed up with the team on Wednesday, but spent time on the sideline working with the strength coach. He missed last weekâ€™s game. He has said his ankle continues to improve, making it possible he will play this week.
