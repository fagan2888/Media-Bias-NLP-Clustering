He was flown to Memorial Hospital in South Bend.\n\nPolice said his vehicle matched the description of a car that was previously reported as being driven recklessly. His blood alcohol level was measured at .27 percent, police said. The Indiana state limit is .08 percent.\n\nMoormann's eastbound car collided with a westbound United States Postal Service truck that was being delivered and was one of seven traveling in a caravan west on U.S. 20, police said. A second postal vehicle was forced off the roadway and into a field and a third truck was struck and damaged.\n\nNone of the USPS vehicles were carrying mail. The drivers of the postal trucks were not transported to the hospital, but did complain of minor pain.\n\nAnother vehicle, driven by Marc Miller, 23, of Griffith, Ind., was eastbound. It was forced off the road and struck a utility pole, but neither Miller nor a passenger were hurt.\n\nAll lanes of U.S. 20 were closed while debris was cleared.\n\nThe accident comes less than 24 hours after another serious crash on U.S. 20 in LaPorte County that occurred near County Road 400 West and critically injured a one-year-old child.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "South Bend Tribune", "description": "One critical after 5-vehicle accident near Fail Road", "title": "Another serious crash on U.S. 20 in LaPorte County", "url": "http://www.southbendtribune.com/news/publicsafety/another-serious-crash-on-u-s-in-laporte-county/article_bbd54cf9-55a7-5706-90ec-f2176f0056d2.html", "image": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/southbendtribune.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/5/5b/55bdae93-2c32-5fa0-82b7-b73a3bbbeaf5/56ffd096b8955.image.jpg?resize=760%2C428", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@sbtribune", "image": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/southbendtribune.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/5/5b/55bdae93-2c32-5fa0-82b7-b73a3bbbeaf5/56ffd096b8955.image.jpg?resize=760%2C428", "description": "One critical after 5-vehicle accident near Fail Road", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Another serious crash on U.S. 20 in LaPorte County"}, "description": "One critical after 5-vehicle accident near Fail Road", "Published Date": "2016-04-02T09:57:00", "fb": {"app_id": 368553839952510}, "keywords": "#loc,publicsafety,local", "google-site-verification": "3g1dW83HuQbWT4MB-AtH0czzqvwh0eF8rwGwC6sjOhM", "news_keywords": "#loc,publicsafety,local"}, "article_summary": "The accident comes less than 24 hours after another serious crash on U.S. 20 in LaPorte County that occurred near County Road 400 West and critically injured a one-year-old child.\nROLLING PRAIRIE \u2014 A Rolling Prairie driver was critically injured in a five-vehicle accident that involved three U.S. postal trucks early Saturday on U.S. 20 just west of Fail Road in LaPorte County.\nThe drivers of the postal trucks were not transported to the hospital, but did complain of minor pain.\nA second postal vehicle was forced off the roadway and into a field and a third truck was struck and damaged.\nLaPorte County Police identified the driver as Gary Moormann, 33."}
