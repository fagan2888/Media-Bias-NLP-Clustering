The proposed rule recommended setting the salary threshold for exempt employees at $50,440 annually, up 113 percent from the current $23,660 annually. Aitken said the final rule may be out as early as late April, but that he expects it no later than the July 4 recess so that it will be out before the presidential nominating conventions.\n\nThe presidential election is \u201clike getting a front-row seat to one of the toughest, longest job interviews in the world,\u201d said Henry G. \u201cHank\u201d Jackson, SHRM president and CEO. \u201cAs the candidates make the case for America to hire them, as HR professionals, we must pay attention.\u201d\n\n4 Top Issues\n\nFor members of both parties, four top issues are, according to a Feb. 1 Gallup poll:\n\nTerrorism and national security.\n\nThe economy.\n\nEmployment and jobs.\n\nHealth care and the Affordable Care Act.\n\nHowever, 92 percent of Republicans cited terrorism and national security and the economy as two issues of above-average importance. Only 82 of Democrats named terrorism as an above-average concern, and 85 percent of Democrats said the economy was an above-average concern.\n\nDemocrats\u2019 No. 1 concern\u2014with 88 percent naming it an above-average concern\u2014is employment and jobs. Among Republicans, 80 percent said employment and jobs was a top concern.\n\nAs for health care and the Affordable Care Act, 83 percent of Democrats said it was a top concern; 75 percent of Republicans said the same.\n\nOf course, what members of the different parties want to do about the top concerns is another matter entirely.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., has created six \u201ctask forces to develop bold agenda for a confident America,\u201d which includes a task force on health care reform, in order to be prepared to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act should Republicans win the White House and retain control of the Senate.\n\nBattle for the Senate\n\nThe Senate will be more difficult for Republicans to keep control of than the House, as Democrats need to gain only five additional seats to effectively control that chamber. The Senate\u2019s long-standing two independent members (Sens. Bernie Sanders, Vt., and Angus King, Maine) caucus with Democrats, Aitken noted. (This presumes that Sanders isn\u2019t elected president; in the presidential race, Sanders calls himself a Democrat.)\n\nIn 2016, only 10 Democratic Senate seats will be up for grabs, compared to 24 Republican seats.\n\nAitken said that Republican senators who may be vulnerable this election include Kelly Ayotte, N.H.; Ron Johnson, Wis.; Mark Kirk, Ill.; and Pat Toomey, Pa.. There is also a seat left vacant by GOP Sen. Marco Rubio, Fla., who is running for president.\n\nPaid Leave\n\nOne issue that is picking up steam for Democrats is paid family leave, Aitken noted. He said that if a Democrat is elected president it will be the \u201cfirst issue advanced in the next Congress.\u201d\n\nAlready, several states have enacted paid-sick-leave requirements, he noted, naming:\n\nCalifornia.\n\nConnecticut.\n\nMassachusetts.\n\nOregon.\n\nVermont.\n\nAnd some states, such as California, New Jersey and Rhode Island, have paid-family-leave insurance programs.\n\nPaid leave has much support among the public. A June 3, 2015, New York Times survey showed 85 percent of Americans in favor of it.\n\nCongress currently is considering the Healthy Families Act (HFA), which would require nearly all employers to provide employees with up to 56 hours of paid sick time in a calendar year. In addition, the Family and Medical Insurance Leave Act would provide partial wage replacement through a payroll tax for eligible Family and Medical Leave Act time off. Neither bill is likely to advance in the Republican-controlled Congress.\n\nRather than a one-size-fits-all government mandate, SHRM favors policy proposals that accommodate varying work environments, employee representation, industries and organizational size.\n\nBipartisan Support?\n\nOne issue that could gain bipartisan support, according to Aitken, is the Pregnancy Discrimination Amendment Act, which has been introduced by Rep. Tim Walberg, R-Mich., and Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska. It would amend the Pregnancy Discrimination Act to clarify that a pregnant employee temporarily unable to do her job must be treated the same as an employee who is also temporarily impaired to do a job. But the working conditions must be similar and both employees must work for the same employer.\n\nAllen Smith, J.D., is the manager of workplace law content for SHRM.
