Eureka, SD

A community remembers a plane crash victim a little more than two months after he and three other men died south of Highmore.

100 golfers teed off today here at the Eureka Municipal Golf Course, but it wasn't a usual round of golf.



Each hold had a unique challenge, including hitting off a water bottle, and using bean bags to determine where to tee off. There were groups of four playing today, decked out in costumes. It cost the teams 80 dollars to join the event, with the money going toward the Logan Rau Memorial Fund. It have been a fun day at the golf course, it also made a big impression on Rau's family.

“It's felt really good. I’ve heard a few stories about Logan and that always warms my heart. Everybody's having fun, and that's priceless,” Logan Rau’s sister, TiAnn Ploncic said.



$5,000 was raised towards the fund.



We will have more from the course, including why golf was the sport picked, coming up tonight on KELOLAND Weekend News at 10.
