It made $37.9 million in sales during its most recent fiscal year.\n\nAside from tourists themselves, Fresh Produce clothing line is also meant to \u201cappeal to non-tourist customers for whom a \u2018vacation state of mind\u2019 resonates,\u201d Ms. Stone said. Its T-shirts have palm trees on them, its capri pants tie with drawstring waists and its selection of tunics drape nicely for that magician\u2019s \u201cnow you see it, now you don\u2019t!\u201d effect. Most items are cotton.\n\nAs the company began to struggle last year, it closed a store, laid off workers and cut employee pay by 10%. But that wasn\u2019t enough to prevent Fresh Produce\u2019s parent company from filing for bankruptcy protection on April 4.\n\nWithout a buyer to rescue its operations, Fresh Produce officials have already made a deal with Illinois sales expert Yellen Partners to begin going-out-of-business sales no later than May 15. Yellen Partners promised that the company would get 86% of the value of its merchandise, give or take some money for fine print.\n\nSome of that sale money could pay off some of the company\u2019s roughly $15.1 million in debt, including a $3.9 million loan from Wells Fargo.\n\nUnder the proposed deal, the doors would close for good by Aug. 31.\n\nAny plan for Fresh Produce\u2014rescue or shutdown\u2014would need approval from Judge Michael Romero.\n\nFresh Produce got its start at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles selling white T-shirts with custom pastel designs that paired with the event\u2019s the color theme. Today, roughly 80% of Fresh Produce merchandise is made in the U.S. using fabrics that are also made here, according to its website.\n\nFresh Produce also sells clothing online and through roughly 400 wholesale customers. Most merchandise moves though a distribution center located in Gardena, Calif.\n\nWrite to Katy Stech at katy.stech@wsj.com.
