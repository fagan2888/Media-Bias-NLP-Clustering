These products often bear claims that they will \u201carouse,\u201d \u201cincrease sexual desire,\u201d or \u201cimprove sexual performance,\u201d but little is known about their efficacy or safety as natural libido enhancers. In a recent study published in the journal Sexual Medicine Reviews, researchers reviewed eight natural aphrodisiacs and analyzed their effectiveness to determine which ones have the lowest health risks while still helping to boost sex drive.\n\nAccording to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), an aphrodisiac is defined as \u201cany product that bears labeling claims that it will arouse or increase sexual desire, or that it will improve sexual performance\u201d \u2014 hence why they\u2019re often considered the catalyst for love. Although the FDA has recognized aphrodisiacs\u2019 potential, experts in the agency agree most of these non-medical approaches are ineffective.\n\nIn an effort to explore which aphrodisiacs actually work, researchers conducted a meta-analysis on products associated with terms like \u201csex\u201d and \u201caphrodisiac,\u201d and reviewed how effective and safe they were when it came to arousing sexual desire.\n\nClick \u201cView Slideshow\" to see which foods might give your libido a boost and which foods fall flat. Also remember that the study called for further research on the potency and safety of these products as they pertain to sexual arousal.
