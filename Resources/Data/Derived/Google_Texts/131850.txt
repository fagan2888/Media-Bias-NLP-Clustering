Wichita Police are investigating after two men were robbed Friday night in Northeast Wichita.

Sgt. Scott Brunow says the two 21-year-old men went to an apartment complex in the 2300 block of North Woodlawn to sell a Playstation 4 that they had advertised on Craigslist. When they arrived, the buyer pulled out a gun and robbed the men of the Playstation and their cell phones.

The suspect is described as a black male, 20 to 25 years old, 6' to 6'3" with a thin build. He was wearing a blue, hooded sweatshirt and gray sweatpants.

Neither man was hurt in the robbery.
