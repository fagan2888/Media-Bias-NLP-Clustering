(AP) - Titan Tire Corp. officials may vacate their local plant, which they still lease from the City of Natchez.\n\nThe plant has not been in service since 2001. The three-story factory was once one of the biggest industries in Natchez.\n\n\u201cThe ideal outcome would be for the city to sell it at a handsome price, and do so quickly,\u201d Mayor Butch Brown told The Natchez Democrat (http://bit.ly/1faCUCr).\n\n\u201cThe longer we hold on to it, and keep it in inventory, the more it is going to cost us,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is nothing out there that we want, so I would love to have that property as a surplus.\u201d\n\nBrown said he has talked with officials from Quincy, Illinois-based Titan Tire and they are interested in turning the factory over to the city.\n\nBrown said Titan must first meet a list of requirements set by the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality about ensuring that the building and the land it sits on is environmentally sound.\n\n\u201cOnce that is done and they\u2019ve removed all their equipment, I\u2019m assuming we would immediately take possession of the property,\u201d Brown said.\n\nThe factory has been under lease by several entities since 1938.\n\nIt started out as the Armstrong Tire Co. under the Balancing Agriculture with Industry Program, a long-term lease program that allowed the city to take out a bond to purchase the property in order to encourage industrial growth.\n\nIn 1986, when Armstrong closed its Natchez plant, some of the management of Armstrong formed the Condere Corp. and bought the plant out, renaming it Fidelity Tire.\n\nAfter Condere went bankrupt in 1998, Titan Tire purchased the plant.\n\nKenneth Young, an engineer for Natchez Titan Tire who now oversees security at the plant, said while the factory was operational, the main products were tires used for agriculture, construction, mining, military and recreation purposes.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Titan Tire Corp. officials may vacate their local plant, which they still lease from the City of Natchez.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jul/18/mayor-titan-tire-property-could-become-surplus/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "Titan Tire Corp. officials may vacate their local plant, which they still lease from the City of Natchez.", "title": "Mayor: Titan Tire property could become surplus"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "description": "Titan Tire Corp. officials may vacate their local plant, which they still lease from the City of Natchez.", "card": "summary", "title": "Mayor: Titan Tire property could become surplus"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "(AP) - Titan Tire Corp. officials may vacate their local plant, which they still lease from the City of Natchez.\nAfter Condere went bankrupt in 1998, Titan Tire purchased the plant.\nKenneth Young, an engineer for Natchez Titan Tire who now oversees security at the plant, said while the factory was operational, the main products were tires used for agriculture, construction, mining, military and recreation purposes.\nIn 1986, when Armstrong closed its Natchez plant, some of the management of Armstrong formed the Condere Corp. and bought the plant out, renaming it Fidelity Tire.\nIt started out as the Armstrong Tire Co. under the Balancing Agriculture with Industry Program, a long-term lease program that allowed the city to take out a bond to purchase the property in order to encourage industrial growth."}
