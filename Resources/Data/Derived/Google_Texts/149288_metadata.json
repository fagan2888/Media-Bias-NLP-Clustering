Climate change. Yes, that laughable theory that has been debunked time and again.\n\nA Sept. 20 Forbes article exposed how \u201cclimate change alarmists\u201d use vagaries and sleight of hand to confuse the public, saying:\n\n\u201cGlobal warming alarmists often misrepresent the peer-reviewed literature, claiming that virtually no peer-reviewed studies call the alarmist narrative into question. In order to make such a claim, they water down their narrative to the mere assertion that global temperatures have warmed during the past century, such that the Earth is no longer in the depths of the extraordinary Little Ice Age. Well heck, nobody disagrees with that. That is the equivalent of posting an opinion poll in which virtually everybody says health care is important and then twisting the poll results to claim virtually everybody favors Obamacare.\u201d\n\nGeldof wasn\u2019t content with just shocking his audience. His high-browed, self-important rhetoric kept coming.\n\n\u201cThe next war will not be a World War I or a World War II, it will be the end,\u201d he said. \u201cWe may not get to 2030. We need to address the problem of climate change urgently.\u201d\n\nBBC News reported that Geldof is planning to take a commercial rocket flight into outer space in 2014. So maybe he can have a look at the Earth and see exactly what global warming looks like from outside the atmosphere. He may just see the folly of his own predictions.\n\n[poll id=\u201d116\u2033]", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "BizPac Review", "description": "Aging rocker and knighted activist Sir Bob Geldof has decided that \u201call humans will die before 2030.\u201d Speaking to a group of youngsters at a summit in Johannesburg, South Africa, Geldof said while predicting the human race\u2019s demise, \u201cThe world can decide in a fit of madness to kill itself,\u201d Daily Star reported.
