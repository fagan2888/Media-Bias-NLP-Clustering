There are many outstanding organizations that can help, such as Encore.org and Senior Corps that help connect older adults with opportunities to contribute their expertise to community projects and organizations or to serve as \u201cmentors, coaches or companions\u201d for individuals in need (as described at www.nationalservice.gov).\n\nFor those who love livelong learning and travel, Roadscholar.org can connect retirees with innumerable educational adventures. As the lifespan is increasing and providing all of us with decades of generally healthy and clear-minded postretirement years, the discovery and cultivation of these passions is critical to filling this time with purpose and meaning.\n\nMarc Agronin (@MarcAgronin), is a geriatric psychiatrist and the author of \u201cHow We Age: A Doctor\u2019s Journey into the Heart of Growing Old.\u201d He is the medical director for mental health and clinical research at Miami Jewish Health Systems and an affiliate associate professor of psychiatry and neurology at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine.\n\nRead the latest Encore Report.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Once upon a time the great American psychiatrist Gene Cohen made an interesting discovery while perusing the extraordinary works of 20 of the greatest African-American folk artists from 1930 to 1980 at an exhibition at the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington DC: 80% of the artists had either started their craft or reached a mature phase after the age of 65, and 30% of them did so after the age of 80.", "title": "How to Find Your Passion Later in Life", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/experts/2014/12/02/how-to-find-your-passion-later-in-life/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/img/WSJ_profile_lg.gif"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "US", "article.headline": "How to Find Your Passion Later in Life", "description": "Once upon a time the great American psychiatrist Gene Cohen made an interesting discovery while perusing the extraordinary works of 20 of the greatest African-American folk artists from 1930 to 1980 at an exhibition at the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington DC: 80% of the artists had either started their craft or reached a mature phase after the age of 65, and 30% of them did so after the age of 80.", "article_section": "US", "author": "Charlie Wells", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "The Experts Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "The Experts", "article.summary": "Once upon a time the great American psychiatrist Gene Cohen made an interesting discovery while perusing the extraordinary works of 20 of the greatest African-American folk artists from 1930 to 1980 at an exhibition at the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington DC: 80% of the artists had either started their craft or reached a mature phase after the age of 65, and 30% of them did so after the age of 80.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-12-02T14:50:31-05:00", "dj.asn": "10-161", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/experts/2014/12/02/how-to-find-your-passion-later-in-life/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-258B-4670", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "US", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Once upon a time the great American psychiatrist Gene Cohen made an interesting discovery while perusing the extraordinary works of 20 of the greatest African-American folk artists from 1930 to 1980 at an exhibition at the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington DC: 80% of the artists had either started their craft or reached a mature phase after the age of 65, and 30% of them did so after the age of 80.", "title": "How to Find Your Passion Later in Life", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/experts/2014/12/02/how-to-find-your-passion-later-in-life/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/blogs/img/WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "The Experts", "article.id": "BL-258B-4670", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-12-02T16:17:53-05:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0dcd\"", "article_summary": "Cohen\u2019s observation teaches us a keen lesson about the potential for finding and developing one\u2019s passion in life: Age is not a barrier but more often the trigger and sustaining fire for creative and meaningful passions in retirement.\nFor those who love livelong learning and travel, Roadscholar.org can connect retirees with innumerable educational adventures.\nStill others start something completely new by trying out a few activities and settling on one that lights a fire\u2013bridge, golf, speed walking, baking, or crocheting signature afghans for the entire family.\nRead the latest Encore Report.\nAs the lifespan is increasing and providing all of us with decades of generally healthy and clear-minded postretirement years, the discovery and cultivation of these passions is critical to filling this time with purpose and meaning."}
