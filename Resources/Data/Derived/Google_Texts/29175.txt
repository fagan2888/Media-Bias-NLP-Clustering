From bridge to bridge, you could hear the rumble of motorcycle engines through Panama City Beach for the 21st annual Cops and Kids Toy Run.

The Panama City Beach Police Department, and the Silver Sands Riders teamed up for the event.

Riders started at the Wicked Wheel before heading west on Front Beach Road towards Carillon Beach.

After reaching Carillon, they headed east on Back Beach Road before ending back at the restaurant.

Each rider was asked to bring an unwrapped toy or cash donation.

"There is a lot of drives right now that are going on for children throughout Bay County and surrounding counties as well, explained Diana Woods, one of the event coordinators. "They toys that are gathered here today, those are distributed from bridge to bridge, from the inter coastal to the gulf. And there is not a family left out."

Officials from the event say they collected more than 300 toys and more than $1,500 in cash donations.

If you want to donate an unwrapped toy to the charity, there are bins setup at the Harley Davidson on Back Beach Road and at the Panama City Beach Police Department.
