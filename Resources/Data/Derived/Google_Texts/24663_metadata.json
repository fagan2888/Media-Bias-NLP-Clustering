In addition, nurses were able to implement practices suggested by the American Organization of Nurse Executives' Care Innovation and Transformation program hospital-wide to 47 departments and three affiliated hospitals.\n\nTo continue making positive changes in the nursing environment, the latest brief encourages organizations to harness nurse leadership and foster interprofessional collaboration in four ways:\n\nMonitor nurse staffing and ensure that all healthcare settings are adequately staffed with appropriately educated, licensed, and certified personnel\n\nCreate institutional cultures that foster professionalism and curb disruptions\n\nHarness nurse leadership at all levels of administration and governance\n\nEducate the current and future workforce to work in teams and communicate better across the health professions\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here's the brief\n\n- read the original report\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nRWJF report examines healthiest, least healthy counties\n\nHospitals, nurses clash on staffing ratios\n\nGive nurses the power to make care decisions to improve patient outcomes\n\nTop 10 nurse-friendly hospitals in the US", "article_metadata": {"description": "The\u00a0nursing\u00a0world has changed for the better throughout the past decade, but there is room for improvement as patients remain at risk for serious harm and\u00a0disruptive behavior\u00a0in the workplace\u00a0continues, according to a new\u00a0brief\u00a0from the\u00a0Robert Woods Johnson Foundation.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "The\u00a0nursing\u00a0world has changed for the better throughout the past decade, but there is room for improvement as patients remain at risk for serious harm and\u00a0disruptive behavior\u00a0in the workplace\u00a0continues, according to a new\u00a0brief\u00a0from the\u00a0Robert Woods Johnson Foundation.", "title": "4 ways to improve the nursing environment, patient safety", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/4-ways-improve-nursing-environment-patient-safety/2014-04-01", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Disruptive Behavior,HR & Workforce Management,injury-producing falls,Institute For Healthcare Improvement,institute of medicine,Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,Nursing,Patient Care & Outcomes,patient safety,Robert Woods Johnson Foundation", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "HR & Workforce Management,Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd98f8\"", "article_summary": "Healthcare organizations must make even more systemic, interprofessional and cultural changes to ensure nurses work in an environment that encourages patient safety, efficiency and accountability, the brief states.\n\"Ten Years After Keeping Patients Safe: Have Nurses' Work Environments Been Transformed?\"\nexamines the changes that hospitals made since the original report \"Keeping Patients Safe: Transforming the Work Environment of Nurses,\" which the Institute of Medicine (IOM) published in 2004.\nIn addition, nurses were able to implement practices suggested by the American Organization of Nurse Executives' Care Innovation and Transformation program hospital-wide to 47 departments and three affiliated hospitals.\nThe nursing world has changed for the better throughout the past decade, but there is room for improvement as patients remain at risk for serious harm and disruptive behavior in the workplace continues, according to a new brief from the Robert Woods Johnson Foundation (RWJF)."}
