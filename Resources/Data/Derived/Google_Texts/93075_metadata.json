It has emboldened them to be overzealous \u2013 with tricks adopted to rake in cash including waiting by cars for parking tickets to expire and ignoring parking bay signs.\n\n\n\nAlso many councils have introduced Sunday patrols, which this year has resulted in a 13 per cent rise in tickets issued on that day.\n\n\n\nRetired photo editor Carrie Haines, 66, of Hampton Wick, South-West London, got a \u00a3110 fine from Richmond council despite having paid \u00a32.50 for a pay-and-display parking ticket when visiting a hair salon.\n\nCarrie says: \u2018There was a pay-and-display machine right in front of where I had parked but the space could also be used for residents with a permit. The attendant ignored the machine and wrongly decided the bay was just for residents.\n\n\n\n\u2018I was left confused and angry about the ticket and I didn\u2019t know what to do. Fortunately a friend stepped in and made sure we had photographic evidence to get the fine overturned.\u2019\n\n\n\nCarrie had the penalty quashed within a fortnight, though the mealy-mouthed council offered no apology or explanation.\n\n\n\nDon't get mad \u2013 take these four steps to win an appeal KEEP CALM: Arguing your case in a polite and reasonable manner is most likely to get results.\n\nInclude photos backed up with specific details \u2013 such as misleading and unclear road signs and ticket discrepancies with incorrect or missing information, for example, a wrong registration number.\n\nMake your initial appeal with copies of the evidence and be sure to present facts within 14 days. This will also increase your chances of paying only half-price for the full penalty if you lose. Appeal directly to the council or private firm. GATHER FACTS: A big reason for being issued a parking fine is failure to display a permit or pay-and-display ticket clearly. Make sure it is not upside down and hasn\u2019t fallen off the dashboard.\n\nWhen appealing it is up to the council to prove it was the driver\u2019s fault that a parking ticket was not visible.\n\nPenalties handed out where there are no clear warnings of restrictions is an area where motorists often win \u2013 the onus is on the council to make sure they are clearly marked. SHOW GOOD REASON: There is also a strong case for throwing out a penalty if a vehicle was parked briefly on a yellow line for a good reason \u2013 such as to help an elderly passenger into their home. Others include vehicle breakdowns, broken parking meters and legally loading or unloading a vehicle. DON\u2019T SURRENDER: For a council-issued Penalty Charge Notice go to the Traffic Penalty Tribunal if you are still not satisfied with its answer. In London it is the Parking and Traffic Appeals Service while in Scotland it is the Scottish Parking Appeals Service. You have 28 days to lodge appeals.\n\nMost penalty fees can be halved if the driver pays up within 14 days. This panics many motorists into paying straight away. But the council may agree to freeze the fine if you make an appeal, so don\u2019t be afraid to ask if it will do this.\n\n\n\nTo appeal, you first need to write direct to the council within 14 days, explaining clearly why you believe the penalty is invalid.\n\n\n\nIf the council does not budge and still wants your money it must then issue a formal letter \u2013 known as a Notice to Owner \u2013 and you are given a further 14 days to explain clearly why you should not pay. If you lose at this stage you will probably not be able to pay the half-price amount.\n\n\n\nHowever, you do not need to give up if the council continues to chase you for money. This is because the matter can be escalated to an independent adjudicator.\n\n\n\nZealous: Wardens now work Sundays\n\nAlong with its final rejection letter, the council should send you an Appeal Notice form to be returned to the Traffic Penalty Tribunal within 28 days. If your appeal fails at this final stage you will have to pay the full sum.\n\n\n\nBarrie Segal, who runs campaign website AppealNow, says there are lots of ways you can beat a fine \u2013 but you must be prepared to fight.\n\n\n\nHe says: \u2018It seems wrong that traffic wardens are always looking for new ways to hand out parking tickets \u2013 including going out on a Sunday. But rather than just feeling aggrieved you should fight back.\n\n\n\n\u2018Be prepared to go all the way. If you provide a well-reasoned and polite argument with full facts, you have a good chance of success.\u2019\n\n\n\nThe appeals process for tickets issued by a council \u2013 officially called Penalty Charge Notices \u2013 should be clearly marked on the ticket.\n\n\n\nBut, you can also get hit with a ticket for parking on private land. These penalties are not handled by councils or covered by their rules.\n\n\n\nPrivate parking firms issue Parking Charge Notices as opposed to public Penalty Charge Notices. If your car is slapped with one of these, you can take your case to the independent Parking on Private Land Appeals scheme if the issuer is signed up to the British Parking Association, as the NCP is.\n\n\n\nIt may be worth standing your ground with private firms that are not members of the British Parking Association, as they rarely have the nerve to take drivers to the County Court, despite their tough rhetoric.\n\n\n\nSince last year, clamping on private land is no longer allowed except at train stations, airports and ports.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "news_keywords": "Why,fight,parking,ticket", "original-source": "http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/cars/article-2477420/Why-fight-parking-ticket.html", "doc-class": "Living Document", "twitter": {"description": "Despite the vast majority of us paying up without arguing, about half of those that take the parking ticket to appeal win their case.
