Marshall has said that disabled children can be God\u2019s vengeance against women who have had abortions. He has described incest as sometimes voluntary, and he has questioned the sexuality of a Supreme Court justice who has favored marriage equality.\n\nBut unlike W. Todd Akin, whose offhanded reference to \u201clegitimate rape\u201d cost the GOP a winnable Senate seat from Missouri in 2012, Mr. Marshall is unbowed over his history of controversial rhetoric as he seeks a seat in Congress representing Northern Virginia.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care. I mean, if I say something in public, I say it in public,\u201d Mr. Marshall said Thursday.\n\nDemocrats, who have built dossiers aggregating the delegate\u2019s more outrageous statements from recent years, have been salivating at the prospect of his emergence from a GOP primary field this month seeking to replace retiring Rep. Frank R. Wolf.\n\nUnlike Mr. Akin, who appeared to be speaking extemporaneously when he said women\u2019s bodies know how to \u201cshut down\u201d pregnancies in cases of \u201clegitimate rape,\u201d Mr. Marshall\u2019s comments aren\u2019t gaffes.\n\nSpeaking before a pro-life group last year, Mr. Marshall offered a long and detailed argument that Justice Anthony M. Kennedy\u2019s majority opinion in the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s ruling on same-sex marriage was unsympathetic to social conservatives.\n\nBut it was the statement with which he capped his remarks that stood out.\n\n\u201cFor all I know, Kennedy\u2019s a homosexual,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t be doing some of these things without this kind of conclusion.\u201d\n\nLike many of his other comments, Mr. Marshall stands by it.\n\n\u201cClearly, some of the people who are making these decisions must be rationalizing their own bad behavior,\u201d he said Thursday.\n\nIn 2010, at an event calling for an end to state funding for Planned Parenthood, Mr. Marshall suggested that women who have abortions are more likely to face \u201cvengeance\u201d from \u201cnature\u201d in children with a greater likelihood of having developmental disabilities.\n\n\u201cThe number of children who are born subsequent to a first abortion who have handicaps has increased dramatically. Why? Because when you abort the firstborn of any, nature takes its vengeance on the subsequent children,\u201d Mr. Marshall said.\n\nThe comment prompted rebukes from all corners and generated a rare statement of regret from Mr. Marshall, who said his remark was misconstrued.\n\n\u201cNo one who knows me or my record would imagine that I believe or intended to communicate such an offensive notion,\u201d he said afterward. \u201cI have devoted a generation of work to defending disabled and unwanted children and have always maintained that they are special blessings to their parents.\u201d\n\nMr. Marshall\u2019s predilection for inflammatory rhetoric isn\u2019t new.\n\nThe author of a 1989 Boston Globe column asked him about his opposition to all abortion \u2014 even in cases of rape, incest, and to save the life of the mother. Mr. Marshall, then the research director for the American Life League, posed a baffling question of his own in response.\n\n\u201cWhat if incest is voluntary?\u201d Mr. Marshall said. \u201cSometimes it is.\u201d\n\nMr. Marshall confirmed the stance Thursday, but he said the author was missing the point and that the position is based on what is written in law.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make it right or legal,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just gives the facts.\u201d\n\nMr. Marshall also has introduced some of the General Assembly\u2019s most conservative bills on social issues.\n\nA staunch opponent of same-sex marriage, he co-sponsored the eponymous Marshall-Newman Amendment that voters approved in 2006 banning same-sex marriage in Virginia. A federal judge this year ruled it unconstitutional.\n\nMr. Marshall has repeatedly introduced \u201cpersonhood\u201d bills to secure civil and legal rights for the unborn from the moment of conception. In 2012, he also introduced a measure that would require women to undergo ultrasounds before having abortions. The legislative effort created headaches for Gov. Bob McDonnell, who ultimately requested an amendment to water down the bill after the news went national and the state became the butt of jokes for late-night comedians.\n\nMr. Marshall, one of the most ardent opponents of the Affordable Care Act, introduced a bill in 2007 that would have established a health care exchange in Virginia akin to what would become known as Obamacare.\n\nWith critics charging hypocrisy, Mr. Marshall said he did it at the request of the conservative Heritage Foundation and for the purposes of getting a ruling on its fiscal impact.\n\nAmong fellow lawmakers, Mr. Marshall is barely tolerated in his own party anymore. His hard-line stands and controversial rhetoric have relegated him to committee assignments in Richmond that do not reflect his seniority. He doesn\u2019t attend caucus meetings.\n\nBut Mr. Marshall has a following among hard-core conservatives.\n\nHe has launched two U.S. Senate bids in the past six years. Although both fell short, he came within about 70 votes out of more than 10,000 cast in his 2008 run for the GOP nomination against former Gov. James S. Gilmore III. He finished third in a four-way primary contest in 2012 won by former Gov. George Allen.\n\nAlthough only scant polling has been conducted in his current race, Mr. Marshall says he thinks he has solid support in the April 26 firehouse primary \u2014 a contest in which he is working to leverage his outsider status.\n\n\u201cFor standing up for you and the Constitution of Virginia, I was stripped of all my seniority for 16 years,\u201d the Republican told the crowd at a debate Wednesday evening. \u201cI would do it again in Washington because I work for you, not a clique there.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Delegate Robert G.
