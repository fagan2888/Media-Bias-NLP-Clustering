Drain your use-it-or-lose it flex spending accounts. Medical expenses paid with a health savings account or flexible spending account cannot be deducted on your taxes. Still, it\u2019s wise to use up all the money in a flexible spending account, which does not roll over year-to-year, although some companies will give you a grace period to use leftover funds through the first few months of the next year. HSA money, on the other hand, does roll over year-to-year, so if you can get a deduction by spending money outside of that account, that may be the wiser move.\n\n2. Bunch up your medical expenses. If you had a high-cost medical event this year, you may be at or near the threshold required for a tax deduction. To write off your medical expenses, you\u2019ll need to have spent more than 10 percent of your adjusted gross income on taxes, or 7.5 percent if you or your spouse are over age 65.\n\nIf you\u2019re near the limit but expect your expenses to be lower next year, booking additional appointments, such as a dental procedures, before the end of the year could put you over the line for the deduction. If you\u2019ve already passed the threshold, scheduling appointments before year-end will ultimately make them cost less.\n\nRelated: The 10 Worst States for Property Taxes\n\n3. Make some charitable contributions. You can usually deduct gifts made to qualified charities. Check the IRS Website to be sure that a charity is eligible, and get a written statement from the organization verifying the gift. If you\u2019re missing documentation for a gift given earlier in the year, take time now to contact the charity for it before they get slammed with requests at tax time.\n\nYou can also get credit for donating household goods like furniture or clothing. Items worth more than $500 require an appraisal. \u201cDonated items are usually worth less than you think,\u201d says Annette Nellen, professor of accountancy and taxation at San Jose State University. \u201cIt\u2019s worth what you\u2019d get for it at a garage sale.\u201d\n\nAnother tax-efficient way to give to charity is to donate shares of appreciated stock. You can take the deduction for the value of the donated shares without having to pay capital gains on the appreciation.\n\n4. Max out your retirement accounts. Contributing as much as possible to your retirement accounts has the double benefit of saving you money on your taxes now (contributions lower your taxable income) and setting you up for a more comfortable retirement.\n\n\n\nParticipants in a 401(k) or 403(b) plan can set aside up to $18,000 a year, and those age 50 or older can stash another $6,000 in \u201ccatch up\u201d contributions. \u201cYou can make changes at any time to your 401(k) contributions, so there\u2019s still time to max out those accounts,\u201d says Paul Jacobs, chief investment officer at Palisades Hudson Financial Group.\n\nRelated: The 7 Taxes We Hate the Most\n\nThe contribution limit for an traditional IRA is $5,500 ($6,500 for those over age 50), but those amounts begin phasing out out for married couples making more than $183,0000, or for those who have access to a workplace retirement plan. (You have until April 15 of next year to put money into an IRA account.)\n\n5. Harvest tax losses (or make use of older ones). The stock market has had a wild ride this year. If you\u2019re sitting on losses, you can sell those investments to offset either capital gains on other investments or your regular taxable income (in the case of regular income, you can apply up to $3,000 of the loss in a single year). Bonus: Any losses you don\u2019t use now against other income can be carried forward to offset gains in future tax years. In order to get the tax benefit, you can\u2019t buy back the shares you sold for at least 30 days.\n\nDespite the potentially valuable tax savings, you shouldn\u2019t make stock sales solely for tax purposes, says Troy Lewis, a CPA in Draper, Utah, and chair of the tax executive committee at the National Institute of Certified Public Accountants. \u201cBut if you\u2019re otherwise inclined to not want to keep certain stocks, now\u2019s the time to sell those so that the loss can be offset with gains.\u201d\n\nSome taxpayers still have big loss carryovers from the recession. Using them to offset any capital gains this year could make a bigger difference to you tax picture than simply applying them to ordinary income.\n\n6. Take your required minimum distribution. If you\u2019re over age 70 \u00bd, you\u2019ll need to be sure to take the required minimum distribution from any retirement plan except for a 401(k) at a company where you\u2019re currently employed. You\u2019ll have to pay ordinary income taxes on the money you take out, but not taking one will result in a tax penalty of 50 percent plus interest on withdrawals you should have taken.\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s How Trump\u2019s Tax Plan Would Affect You\n\nThe amount you must take is calculated based on your account balance and your life expectancy, but generally your account provider will calculate what you need to withdraw each year. Look at the required withdrawal strategically, using it to adjust your asset allocation and get rid of any dogs in your portfolio.\n\n7. Consider a 529 contribution. If you\u2019re saving for college for children or grandchildren you may be able to get a deduction on your state income taxes. The rules vary by state (check out yours here), with some states offering no tax benefits and other implementing no limit on contributions. There\u2019s no federal tax deduction for money put into a 529 account, but balances grow tax-free, and there are no taxes on withdrawals made for qualified education expenses.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "This time of year, it\u2019s easy to get caught up in holiday planning and shopping, but ta", "title": "7 Money-Saving Tax Moves to Make Before 2016", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/05/7-Money-Saving-Tax-Moves-Make-2016", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/09132012_tax_loophole_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/05/7-Money-Saving-Tax-Moves-Make-2016", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/09132012_tax_loophole_article.jpg", "creator": "@bethbrav", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "This time of year, it\u2019s easy to get caught up in holiday planning and shopping, but ta", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "If you had a high-cost medical event this year, you may be at or near the threshold required for a tax deduction.\nMedical expenses paid with a health savings account or flexible spending account cannot be deducted on your taxes.\nIf you\u2019re saving for college for children or grandchildren you may be able to get a deduction on your state income taxes.\nThere\u2019s no federal tax deduction for money put into a 529 account, but balances grow tax-free, and there are no taxes on withdrawals made for qualified education expenses.\nThe rules vary by state (check out yours here), with some states offering no tax benefits and other implementing no limit on contributions."}
