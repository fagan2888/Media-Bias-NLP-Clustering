Collecting data, improving communication between clinicians and patients, and educating clinicians and staff about LGBT health issues will help to ensure high-quality care and better access for sexual and gender minorities.\n\nIn a recent Hospitals in Pursuit of Excellence webinar, Harvey Makadon, M.D., program director at the National LGBT Health Education Center at the Fenway Institute, Fenway Health, and a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, discussed the stigma that has contributed to health and health care inequities for LGBT individuals and action steps for providing equitable care. John Knudsen, M.D., medical director of the Clinical Practice Office of Health Equity and Inclusionat Mayo Clinic, shared what the Minnesota-based health system is doing to improve care for LGBT patients.\n\nMore Focus on LGBT Health Issues\n\nRecent reports and initiatives are drawing more attention to the health issues of LGBT individuals. In 2011, the Institute of Medicine released \u201cThe Health of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender People: Building a Foundation for Better Understanding,\u201d a report that examines the \u201cunique health disparities\u201d of sexual and gender minorities and includes recommendations for further research and understanding of LGBT health. Healthy People 2020 includes LGBT health as a topic area, with suggested interventions and resources to improve the \u201chealth, safety and well-being\u201d of LGBT individuals.\n\nImproving LGBT health care access is an important population health issue. Statistics show that LGBT youth have a higher rate of suicide and homelessness and a higher rate of tobacco, alcohol and other drug use. Gay men have a higher risk of HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases. Lesbians are less likely to be screened for cancer. In addition, discriminatory practices have limited health care access and health insurance access for LGBT individuals.\n\nAn Inclusive, Affirming Environment for All\n\nTo provide equitable care, hospitals and health systems must increase awareness and education on LGBT issues. \u201cHealth organizations can do more to create a more inclusive, affirmative environment for LGBT individuals,\u201d says Makadon. There is \u201ctoo little training and attention\u201d to create such an environment, he adds. According to Makadon, the four main challenges in providing equitable care to LGBT patients are: (1) data collection, (2) clinical education, (3) consumer education, and (4) patient-centered care.\n\nThe education center at Fenway Institute and the IOM recommend including information about a patient\u2019s sexual orientation and gender identity in electronic health records. The education center suggests collecting this data along with information on the patient\u2019s sex assigned at birth and preferred name/pronoun. Information about the patient\u2019s sexual practice would best be collected as part of the patient\u2019s medical history, Makadon recommends. This information is critical for population health management, he adds.\n\nImproving provider-patient communication is also key. Anecdotally, about half of physicians ask patients about their sexual health, and very few physicians ask patients about their sexual orientation or gender identity, explainsMakadon. A recent study in the American Journal of Public Health found that 84 percent of physicians had discussed adherence to antiretroviral therapy with HIV-positive patients, but only 14 percent of physicians had discussed HIV transmission and/or risk reduction.\n\nThe education center has published \u201cTen Things: Creating Inclusive Health Care Environments for LGBT People,\u201d which highlights 10 topics for health care organizations to consider, such as ensuring the hospital has a nondiscriminatory policy that includes sexual orientation, gender identity and sexual gender expression. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to have a policy and one thing to make it real,\u201d Makadon says. Other topics include providing clinicians and staff with knowledge about the health needs of LGBT patients and ensuring that LGBT employees feel respected and safe in the workplace. The education center provides additional resources for hospitals, including \u201cDo Ask, Do Tell\u201d templates for creating posters and pamphlets that encourage patients to talk to their providers about being LGBT.\n\nCulture Changes at Mayo Clinic\n\nA presentation to leadership by an employee resource group helped to improve the care and climate for LGBT patients at Mayo Clinic, based in Rochester, Minn. The LGBT employee resource group shared compelling stories with clinical leaders about \u201cincorrect assumptions, awkwardness, misunderstanding, suboptimal care and, even in some circumstances, hostility,\u201d says Knudsen. In response, Mayo\u2019s leadership established the Office of Health Equity and Inclusion, a \u201cpivotal moment for our LGBT patients and other patients that face inequities of care,\u201d Knudsen asserts.\n\nEnsuring organizational readiness and handling competing priorities were two challenges at Mayo. \u201cSome people didn\u2019t know what LGBT stood for,\u201d Knudsen says of the initial lack of exposure and awareness across the health care organization about LGBT health issues. In addition, with so many competing priorities, it\u2019s imperative to make room at the table to discuss LGBT health, Knudsen says.\n\nKey lessons learned at Mayo Clinic include:\n\n\u00b7 Getting leadership buy-in. Knudsen advises identifying a leadership champion in the health care organization and then not only providing needed support, but also understanding and helping to tackle the challenges ahead.\n\n\u00b7 Aligning with other efforts to eliminate disparities. Creating connections with other groups that experience care disparities and building alliances with other equity champions in the organization will be beneficial.\n\n\u00b7 Aligning health care equity with key strategic business priorities. Making the business case for health equity and linking equity to business performance contribute to achieving success, Knudsen says.\n\nIn the two years since Mayo Clinic established its equity and inclusion office, awareness and knowledge about LGBT health issues have increased. The health care organization now is including LGBT topics in grand rounds and continuing medical education conferences, expanding health coverage and services to transgender patients and families, and distributing an LGBT-friendly provider list. Knudsen says the work will lead to improved care and better outcomes. All these efforts are ending the invisibility of LGBT patients at the health care organization.\n\nVisit the Hospitals in Pursuit of Excellence website for the webinar presentation and slides on \u201cEnsuring Access and High-Quality Care for LGBT Patients.\u201d The HRET Disparities Toolkit is available free of charge.\n\nCynthia Hedges Greisingis a communications specialist with the AHA\u2019s Health Research & Educational Trust, Chicago.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Collecting patient data, improving patient-provider communication and educating clinicians and staff will help to ensure quality care for sexual and gender minorities.", "csrf-token": "AGbPOPvOPHcScC27IudOHSCRfBRLeEQMdZrh31Pe054=", "twitter": {"image": "http://www.hhnmag.com/ext/resources/inc-hhn/img/articles/author_photos/archives/g/Greising_190x127.jpg?1460058893", "description": "Collecting patient data, improving patient-provider communication and educating clinicians and staff will help to ensure quality care for sexual and gender minorities.", "card": "summary", "title": "Providing High-Quality Care to LGBT Patients"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "og": {"image": "http://www.hhnmag.com/ext/resources/inc-hhn/img/articles/author_photos/archives/g/Greising_190x127.jpg?1460058893", "type": "Article", "description": "Collecting patient data, improving patient-provider communication and educating clinicians and staff will help to ensure quality care for sexual and gender minorities.", "title": "Providing High-Quality Care to LGBT Patients"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/images/favicons/favicon-144.png", "keywords": "H&HN, hospital & health care business executives, health care management, hospital governance, hospital finance, health reform, Affordable Care Act, meaningful use, health IT", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda92d\"", "article_summary": "While hospitals and health care systems work to provide equitable health care to all patients, LGBT individuals remain invisible to many health care providers.\nMore Focus on LGBT Health IssuesRecent reports and initiatives are drawing more attention to the health issues of LGBT individuals.\nAccording to Makadon, the four main challenges in providing equitable care to LGBT patients are: (1) data collection, (2) clinical education, (3) consumer education, and (4) patient-centered care.\nImproving LGBT health care access is an important population health issue.\nAll these efforts are ending the invisibility of LGBT patients at the health care organization."}
