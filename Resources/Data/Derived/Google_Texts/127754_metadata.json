On the other, there are fewer companies with which to do business.\n\nCognizant said on Wednesday it did not expect a 7-year deal it signed with health insurer Health Net Inc last year to be implemented after the company agreed to be bought by larger rival Centene Corp.\n\nChief Executive Francisco D'Souza said it was unclear in the short term how other deals would affect his company.\n\n\"We have been appropriately prudent as we have given our guidance to account for that,\" he told Reuters.\n\nCognizant raised its forecast for full-year adjusted profit to at least $3.00 per share from $2.93 and its forecast for revenue to at least $12.33 billion, from $12.24 billion.\n\nAnalysts on average expected a profit $2.97 per share and revenue of $12.32 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\n\nRevenue rose 22.6 percent to $3.09 billion. Excluding items, Cognizant earned 79 cents per share. Analysts on average had expected 73 cents per share and revenue of $3.03 billion.\n\nUp to Tuesday's close, the stock had risen more than 20 percent in the past 12 months.\n\n(Reporting by Abhirup Roy in Bengaluru; Editing by Don Sebastian and Ted Kerr)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Abhirup Roy", "Author": "Abhirup Roy", "DCSext.PageNumber": 1, "twitter": {"description": "IT services provider Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp reported stronger-than-expected quarterly revenue and profit, as its business that serves the healthcare industry led the company's growth for the third quarter in a row.", "title": "Cognizant boosts forecast again after healthy quarter", "image": {"src": "http://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}, "creator": "@Reuters", "site": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "DCSext.rChannel": "Article -
