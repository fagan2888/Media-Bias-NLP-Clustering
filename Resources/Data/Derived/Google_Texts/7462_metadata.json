But the American people were evenly split, 30 to 31 percent, on whether blacks should have more or less influence, with 28 percent saying things were \u201cabout right\u201d as they stood. What\u2019s more, those opposed to government social spending programs were three times more likely to say blacks should have less influence compared to those supporting social spending.\n\nThose historical tidbits, from \u201cThe Political Beliefs of Americans; a Study of Public Opinion\u201d by Lloyd Free and Hadley Cantril, immediately came to mind last week when Louisiana Sen. Mary Landrieu, locked in a tight reelection fight \u2014 as always \u2014 made a lot of headlines with her comments noting that race had something to do with President Obama\u2019s unpopularity in the state.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be very, very honest with you. The South has not always been the friendliest place for African-Americans,\u201d she told NBC News in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s been a difficult time for the president to present himself in a very positive light as a leader.\u201d\n\nThis is hardly earth-shattering news from the state that brought us Plessy v. Ferguson in the 1890s, and the deeply racialized devastation of Katrina less a decade ago, after which even President Bush admitted that \u201cdeep, persistent poverty\u201d in the area \u201chas roots in a history of racial discrimination, which cut off generations from the opportunity of America.\u201d Speaking of Katrina, according to a PPP poll last year, the good people of Louisiana \u201cwere evenly split on who was most responsible for the poor Hurricane Katrina response: George W. Bush or Obama, 28/29.\u201d Given that Obama was a first-year senator at the time of Katrina, it\u2019s not hard to see what Landrieu was driving at.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the role of race was only a tertiary matter in Landrieu\u2019s account. When asked why the president had such a hard time in the state, Landrieu first said it was \u201cbecause his energy policies are really different than ours,\u201d then when pushed further, she added, \u201cbecause he put the moratorium on offshore drilling,\u201d after the disastrous BP oil spill.\n\nIt was only after laying out those policy complaints that Landrieu got around to discussing race. Yet, predictably, fourth-tier 2016 GOP presidential wannabe Bobby Jindal, Louisiana\u2019s governor, instantly made an ass of himself, calling her comments \u201cremarkably divisive,\u201d which takes a lot of chutzpah, coming from a racial panderer who just three years ago pledged he would sign a \u201cbirther\u201d bill if it reached his desk.\n\nJindal also claimed that \u201cthe people of Louisiana are willing to give everyone a fair hearing,\u201d a claim belied by that PPP poll, and that certainly didn\u2019t apply to Jindal\u2019s own exclusive focusing on Landrieu\u2019s tertiary reference to race. Nor does it comport with the tenacity of birtherism, which has only grown more intense, the more thoroughly it\u2019s been discredited.\n\nBirtherism, you see, has become the GOP\u2019s more widespread manifestation of racial codespeak in the Obama era. Although Obama deftly quieted the elite media trolls with the release of his long-form birth certificate just after Donald Trump had ridden birther hysteria to the top of the GOP primary field in April 2011, the GOP base was never really dissuaded. In fact, nine months later, in January 2012, a YouGov poll found that more Republicans than ever questioned Obama\u2019s citizenship. Those denying his American birth outright were up 50 percent, from 25 percent of all Republicans to 37 percent, while those accepting his American birth were down 10 percent, from 30 percent to 27 percent of all Republicans. Indisputable hard evidence did nothing at all to dissipate the birther delusion, it only made it stronger. That\u2019s not something Mary Landrieu made up. The GOP\u2019s own partisan media did that.\n\nAlthough birtherism is a complex phenomenon in its own right, Landrieu \u2014 like Bush before her \u2014 was referencing a much broader problem facing Obama, as well as herself, and the Democratic Party as a whole. You\u2019re not supposed to call it \u201cracism,\u201d because racism means KKK mobs in hoods, and police siccing snarling dogs on young children, and we\u2019re not like that anymore \u2014 see, we\u2019ve got armored vehicles and sound cannons now!\n\nBut 40 years of data from the General Social Survey \u2014 the gold standard of American public opinion research \u2014 say otherwise. They tell us that Southern whites overwhelmingly blame blacks for their lower economic status, ignoring or denying the role played by discrimination, past and present, in all its various forms, and that the balance of Southern white attitudes has barely changed at all in 40 years. At the same time, attitudes outside the white South have shifted somewhat \u2014 but still tend to blame blacks more than white society, steadfastly ignoring mountains of evidence to the contrary \u2014 such as 60 years of unemployment data, over which time \u201cthe unemployment rate for blacks has averaged about 2.2 times that for whites,\u201d as noted by Pew Research. It is only Democrats outside the white South who have dramatically shifted away from blaming blacks over this period of time, and the tension this has created within the Democratic Party goes to the very heart of the political challenge both Obama and Landrieu face \u2014 a challenge that is not going to simply go away any time soon.\n\nBefore turning to the GSS data, it\u2019s worth noting that it\u2019s hardly an anomalous finding. A 2011 study from Tufts (press release/full study) found that whites as a whole see racism as a zero-sum game, such that decreases in discrimination against blacks over the decades are reflected in increases in discrimination against whites, so that now whites are more discriminated against than blacks. This perception is not simply mistaken, it\u2019s downright delusional, flying in the face of mountains of objective data. For example, a June 2014 study by Young Invincibles, \u201cClosing the Race Gap,\u201d found that blacks need to complete two more levels of education to have the same probability of employment as their white counterparts. Nonetheless, as explained in the Tufts press release:\n\nOn average, whites rated anti-white bias as more prevalent in the 2000s than anti-black bias by more than a full point on the 10-point scale. Moreover, some 11 percent of whites gave anti-white bias the maximum rating of 10 compared to only 2 percent of whites who rated anti-black bias a 10. Blacks, however, reported only a modest increase in their perceptions of \u201creverse racism.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a striking finding, but it only represents a snapshot in time. The GSS, in contrast, has 40 years of data, and allows us to analyze geographical and political subgroups as well. Since the 1970s, the GSS has included four questions about the causes of blacks\u2019 lower socioeconomic status. Specifically, it asks, \u201cOn the average (negroes/blacks/African-Americans) have worse jobs, income, and housing than white people. Do you think these differences are\n\na. Mainly due to discrimination? b. Because most (negroes/blacks/African-Americans) have less in-born ability to learn? c. Because most (negroes/blacks/African-Americans) don\u2019t have the chance for education that it takes to rise out of poverty? d. Because most (negroes/blacks/African-Americans) just don\u2019t have the motivation or willpower to pull themselves up out of poverty?\n\nOf these four alternatives, (b) is a blatant example of classical racism, endorsed by the white conservative establishment, as in Charles Murray\u2019s \u201cThe Bell Curve,\u201d but widely seen as beyond the pale in America today. In fact, it\u2019s precisely the fact that most people don\u2019t think this way anymore that convinces so many whites that racism is a thing of the past.", "article_metadata": {"description": "All the conventional wisdom you'll hear tonight is wrong: Republican gains are really proof of age-old ugliness", "title": "It is all still about race: Obama hatred, the South and the truth about GOP wins", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "All the conventional wisdom you'll hear tonight is wrong: Republican gains are really proof of age-old ugliness", "title": "It is all still about race: Obama hatred, the South and the truth about GOP wins", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/11/04/it_is_all_still_about_race_obama_hatred_the_south_and_the_truth_about_gop_wins/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/confederate_flags.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "All the conventional wisdom you'll hear tonight is wrong: Republican gains are really proof of age-old ugliness", "title": "It is all still about race: Obama hatred, the South and the truth about GOP wins", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/confederate_flags.jpg", "creator": "@PaulHRosenberg", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Paul Rosenberg", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Barack Obama, Bobby Jindal, Election 2014, Mary Landrieu, Race, The South", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9988\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Barack Obama, Bobby Jindal, Election 2014, Mary Landrieu, Race, The South, Politics NewsIn 1964, there were five black members of the House of Representatives \u2014 barely over 1 percent \u2014 compared to the 11 percent of the population who were black.\nThe South has not always been the friendliest place for African-Americans,\u201d she told NBC News in an interview.\nIt was only after laying out those policy complaints that Landrieu got around to discussing race.\nWhat\u2019s more, the role of race was only a tertiary matter in Landrieu\u2019s account.\nBirtherism, you see, has become the GOP\u2019s more widespread manifestation of racial codespeak in the Obama era."}
