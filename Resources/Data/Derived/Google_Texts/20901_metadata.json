He has thousands of dollars of medical bills to pay back, and no health coverage until January of 2016.\n\nDale Peplinski said his employer did not provide health insurance this year because of the 40 percent increase due to the changes in healthcare. Therefore, Peplinski went to sign up for insurance through the affordable care act, and as far as he knew he was all set. Two months later Peplinski said his insurance cancelled with no warning.\n\n\u201cMemorial Day I had a health condition come up and I go into the emergency room and give them by Blue Health Network card. The lady says. \u2018I have bad news. Your card has been denied,\u2019\u201d said Peplinski.\n\nDale Peplinski had numbness in his left arm, and chest pains so bad he could barely breathe. He left the hospital that day with three things: bills up to $2,000, no explanation for what caused the heart attack-like symptoms, and that his health insurance had been cancelled 4-months prior on January 31st.\n\n\u201cI was just blindsided. I knew nothing about any of this until Memorial Day,\u201d said Peplinski.\n\nPeplinski first signed up for health insurance through the Griswold Group in Grand Rapids.\n\n\u201cWell I didn\u2019t trust myself to go online and dot my own i\u2019s and cross my own t\u2019s, so I thought I would go there and have them guide me through it,\u201d said Peplinski.\n\nPeplinski thought the Griswold Group had him all set up. He paid monthly invoices for November, December, and January, but what he didn\u2019t know is that his rate changed. The rate increased by $11.25.\n\n\u201cThey should have had me down as a 48-year-old male, but they had me down as 47-year-old male and evidently it makes $11.27 cents difference. It comes down to $11.27,\u201d said Peplinski.\n\nSomewhere along the line Peplinski said his age was entered incorrectly, and when it was corrected his rate for insurance went up causing him to be $11.27 short in January on his premium. Peplinski said he was never notified of that change.\n\n\u201cWhat is disturbing is when I called Blue Care Network and went downtown to their office on Cascade. They told me I should have been notified by the Griswold Group,\u201d said Peplinski.\n\nThe \u2018finger pointing\u2019 game followed that got nowhere, because he only had 30 days to pay the $11.27. Peplinski can\u2019t enroll in coverage until January, which means his heart condition will have to wait. On top of that, he\u2019ll be fined at the end of the year by the federal government for not having insurance.\n\n\u201cThis just can\u2019t be. This just can be. You can\u2019t think it would happen to you, until your living it,\u201d said Peplinski.\n\nFox 17 News reached out to the Griswold Group to see if they take any responsibility for the age being wrong in his original application. They did not send us the original paperwork for Peplinksi\u2019s application as we asked, but instead referred us to talk to Blue Cross Network.\n\n\u201cThey have a 30 day grace period and it doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s $11 or $1100 or even $.11, we are required by law that if they don\u2019t\u2019 pay that premium in full within that 30 day period they face cancellation,\u201d said Rick Notter of Blue Cross Blue Shield.\n\nFox 17 News asked Blue Care Network if they are held responsible for lost mail. Peplinksi claims he never received a letter in the mail notifying him of the rate change or the cancellation. Blue Cross Blue Shield said if Peplinski can prove the mail got lost he can appeal the cancellation. When Fox 17\u2019s Cassandra Arsenault asked how you can prove you didn\u2019t receive mail, the Blue Cross Network said that\u2019s not a question for them.\n\nBlue Cross Blue Shield said Peplinski has limited options, and their hands are tied due to federal law.\n\n\u201cIf your electricity gets turned off you can pay it in full and they will turn it back on. With health insurance you have to wait for the open enrollment period. As a carrier we have to abide by those laws and rules. We are definitely not in the business of wanting to cancel polices,\u201d said Notter.\n\nThere is some light at the end of the tunnel. Fox 17 News talked to Elizabeth Schinderle of the US Department of Health and Human Service, who sent us this e-mail that said they will have someone from their casework resolution team look into Peplinski\u2019s file. Meanwhile Peplinski hoping his heart stays healthy as the days pass.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge concern. I am just trying to lay low and not do too much and just hope every day the good lord lets me wake up,\u201d said Peplinski.\n\nThe reason Peplinski cannot be re-enrolled for the misunderstanding is because the Affordable Care Act is set up so people can\u2019t beat the system. They encourage people to have coverage for the whole year, so that people don\u2019t just enroll to take care of medical problem, and then just drop it right after it is taken care of, and they are healed.", "article_metadata": {"description": "GRAND RAPIDS, Mich.-- A West Michigan man with a heart condition is out of health insurance all because of a rate change of $11.27.\u00a0 He has thousands of dollars of medical bills to pay back, and no health coverage until January of 2016.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "Fox17", "description": "GRAND RAPIDS, Mich.\u2013 A West Michigan man with a heart condition is out of health insurance all because of a rate change of $11.27.\u00a0 He has thousands of dollars of medical bills to pay back, a\u2026", "title": "Man with potential heart condition gets dropped from health insurance over $11.27", "url": "http://fox17online.com/2015/08/06/man-with-potential-heart-condition-gets-dropped-from-health-insurance-over-11-27/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "https://tribwxmi.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/health-insurance-dropped.jpg?w=1200", "height": 675}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://tribwxmi.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/health-insurance-dropped.jpg?w=640"}, "site": "@fox17", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@fox17"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "News, Weather, Traffic and Sports for Grand Rapids and West Michigan.", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=593636323", "fb": {"pages": 307582000539}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://fox17online.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/288b65c5171c9f04de9e65215f6a4d7d?s=16", "application-name": "Fox17", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/fox17online", "published_time": "2015-08-07T02:33:06+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-07T02:33:06+00:00", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/fox17online"}, "keywords": "news, problem solvers,", "google-site-verification": "NSPbua0tLdVnRQbakGRZKFFd73lsjqW8d53L7t4RfUg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd930e\"", "article_summary": "Blue Cross Blue Shield said Peplinski has limited options, and their hands are tied due to federal law.\n\u201cMemorial Day I had a health condition come up and I go into the emergency room and give them by Blue Health Network card.\nBlue Cross Blue Shield said if Peplinski can prove the mail got lost he can appeal the cancellation.\nPlease enable Javascript to watch this videoGRAND RAPIDS, Mich.-- A West Michigan man with a heart condition is out of health insurance all because of a rate change of $11.27.\nWith health insurance you have to wait for the open enrollment period."}
