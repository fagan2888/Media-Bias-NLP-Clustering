Actually More Lessons Ignored\n\n\u201cThe origin and outset of the American Republic, contain lessons of which posterity ought not to be deprived.\u201d \u2013James Madison (1819)\n\nAs the list of Democrats distancing themselves from Barack Obama and his so-called \u201cAffordable Care Act\u201d continues to grow, Obama imparted this remarkable observation:\n\n\u201cWhen we buy IT services generally, it is so bureaucratic and so cumbersome that a whole bunch of it doesn\u2019t work or ends up being way over cost. \u2026 Once we get this particular website fixed they\u2019re going to be some lessons learned we can apply to the federal government in general.\u201d\n\nEvidently, Obama is conjunctionally challenged when he says, \u201cit doesn\u2019t work OR ends up being way over cost.\u201d The correct conjunction in this case is, of course, \u201cAND.\u201d\n\nHowever, his claim that \u201ccumbersome bureaucracy\u201d is to blame is entirely accurate, and that is true across the full spectrum of our government\u2019s bloated bureaucracies. Other key Obama administration officials agree.\n\nObama\u2019s former White House Chief of Staff (SecDef and CIA director), Leon Panetta, offered this keen insight on the cascading failure of O'Care: \u201cYou cannot rely on the bureaucracies to do this kind of work. They don\u2019t have the capabilities to get this done.\u201d\n\nObama\u2019s former chief economic advisor, Larry Summers, notes that, as a result of the O'Care failure, \u201ca shadow has been cast on the government\u2019s competence.\u201d\n\nOf course, our Founders cast that long shadow on government competence when they forged our Constitution\u2019s limits on the powers of the central government. Those limits notwithstanding, any question today about the constitutionality of socialist government programs is dismissed in the now-infamous words of Vermont Democrat Patrick Leahy, Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee: \u201cNobody questions that!\u201d\n\nDespite Obama\u2019s assertion to the contrary, there are few new lessons to be learned from the compounding failure of his signature endeavor to nationalize health care. Those lessons have been taught and re-taught ad nauseam, ever since the earliest adoption of Marxist doctrines by governments and the inevitable failures that followed. (See \u201cUSSR.\u201d)\n\nAs 20th century philosopher George Santayana concluded in his treatise, \u201cThe Life of Reason\u201d:\n\n\u201cProgress, far from consisting in change, depends on retentiveness. When experience is not retained, as among savages, infancy is perpetual. Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.\u201d\n\nThere is nothing to be learned from the second kick of a jackass, except possibly in the case of those who are too dullard to remember the first. Socialist government centralization schemes are destined to fail, and Obama can apply that to the \u201cfederal government in general\u201d right now.\n\nSuch schemes collapse under the pressure of bureaucratic ineptitude, or \u201cIneptocracy,\u201d which is defined as a political system of government where the incompetent are elected by the unproductive in return for goods and services redistributed from the competent and productive, until the former so outnumber the latter that the system collapses. (See \u201cDemocratic Party Platform\u201d)\n\nTo put the current state of bureaucratic ineptitude into perspective during this week in which we observe Veterans Day, consider the following:\n\nThe time lapsed from the date O'Care was passed, 23 March 2010, to the date Healthcare.gov was to be operational, 01 October 2013, is 3 years, 6 months and 10 days. For comparison, from the date of our entry into WWII to the date of Germany\u2019s surrender is one month LESS than Obama and his Leftist NeoCom cadres had to make their website operational. Obama had more time than it took for our nation\u2019s industrial surge ahead of the invasion of North Africa and Italy, D-Day, the Battle of the Bulge, the race to Berlin, and all while fully engaged on a second warfront in the Pacific.\n\nNotably, generations of American veterans have given their lives honoring their oaths to \u201cSupport and Defend\u201d our Constitution. It\u2019s long past time that our entire nation demanded that its political leaders honor their oaths!\n\nAnd here is some additional data for perspective.\n\nThe health insurance exchanges processed only 106,000 signups in October, and fewer than 27,000 of those were through the 36 O'Care exchanges. However, there were 1,687,600 background checks for firearms purchases processed through the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. (Apparently NICS software is working just fine.) Though Obama wants folks clinging to government welfare, American Patriots know that the Second Amendment is the supreme insurance policy \u2013 by a 15:1 ratio!\n\nFor BO\u2019s administration to make its 5-million signup goal by the end of open enrollment in March, they will have to sign up more than 45,000 people each and every day.\n\nUnfortunately, there were 392,000 signups for Obama\u2019s expanded Medicaid coverage, ensuring explosive growth in state liabilities to fund that \u201centitlement.\u201d Notably, taxpayers across the nation will feel that pinch immediately because states have balanced budget requirements and can\u2019t print their own money.\n\nWhile there are no old lessons to be learned from the continuing failures of nationalized health care, there are two very significant contemporary lessons.\n\nThe First lesson from the ObamaCare failures:\n\nGiven the omnipresence of open mikes and video recordings around our Beltway-based politicians, if one lies today about something one said on any earlier day in office, that politician can expect to get caught in that lie. In the case of Obama, who just can\u2019t shut up even when his staff has pleaded with him to stick to his tele-prompted shtick, his incessant lies have turned what was once a credibility gap into a great chasm.\n\nWhile BHO has been busy spinning new lies to cover his old lies about folks keeping their doctors and insurance plans, we came across a recorded exchange from a 25 February 2010 conference between Obama and House Majority Leader Eric Cantor. In that meeting, Cantor called Obama out on the cancellations:\n\n\u201cOne of the promise you ought to make is that people ought to be able to keep the health insurance that they have. Between 8 and 9 million people may very well lose the covers that they have because of the construct of this bill. That\u2019s our concern. I don\u2019t think that you can answer the question in the positive that people will be able to maintain their coverage, that people will be a will see the doctors they want in the bill that you\u2019re proposing.\u201d\n\nObama responded:\n\n\u201cThe 8-9 million people that you refer to who might have to change their coverage would be folks who \u2026 would find the deal in the exchange better, would be a better deal, so yes they would change coverage because they have more choices. Let\u2019s just be clear about that!\u201d (They will get a better deal, which apparently cancels out their cancellation.)\n\nYes, let\u2019s do be \u201cclear about that.\u201d\n\nDNC Chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-FL) repeated Obama\u2019s \u201cbetter deal\u201d claim this week. Now that more than 5 MILLION Americans have already had their private insurance cancelled, Wasserman Schultz declared, \u201cit is a real significant distortion to say that hundreds of thousands of people are being cancelled. What\u2019s actually happening is that they are very likely to get a better plan for less money.\u201d\n\nNew York Post and Daily Beast editorial writer Kirsten Powers, an Obama defender who occasionally stumbles upon hard truths, saw her insurance cancelled. Of the Demo claims that cancellations are good because those former policy owners will receive better coverage at a lower price, Powers protests:\n\n\u201cMy blood pressure goes up every time they say that they\u2019re protecting us from substandard health insurance plans. There is nothing to support what they\u2019re saying. I have talked about how I\u2019m losing my health insurance. If I want to keep the same health insurance, it\u2019s going to cost twice as much. There\u2019s nothing substandard about my plan. All of the things they say that are not in my plan are in my plan. All of the things they have listed \u2013 there\u2019s no explanation for doubling my premiums other than the fact that it\u2019s subsidizing other people. They need to be honest about that.\u201d\n\nOf course, most of Obama\u2019s other adoring editorial page editors and syndicated columnists are not ready to \u201cbe honest about that,\u201d and continue to question whether Obama actually knew that he was lying \u2013 apparently in deference to a kinder, gentler interpretation of the word \u201clie.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times referred to Obama\u2019s \u201cyou can keep it, period\u201d lies as an \u201cincorrect promise.\u201d (Our friend Byron York at The Washington Examiner conducted a LexisNexis database search of the Times over the decades. \u201cNever in that time, until today,\u201d he reports, \u201cdid the paper use the phrase \u2018incorrect promise.\u2019\u201d)\n\nEditors of Obama\u2019s hometown paper, the Chicago Tribune, wrote, \u201cThe American public is having a credibility-shattering debate about the president: Did he not bother to learn the details of the law before he told us we could keep our doctors and our insurance, or did he know the truth and flat-out lie?\u201d\n\nSafe to say it is a \u201cflat-out lie,\u201d and eventually, even Obama\u2019s most unflinching supporters will have to admit it \u2013 or tumble headlong into the same credibility chasm.\n\nEven that notorious finger-wagger, Bill Clinton, endeavoring to put some distance between his ambitious wife and O'Care (an idea she promoted when she was \u201cFirst Lady\u201d), was careful not to accuse Obama of an outright lie. Clinton, no stranger to bald-face lies, said, \u201cEven if it takes a change to the law, the president should honor the commitment the federal government made and let \u2018em keep what they got.\u201d (Memo to Bill: The \u201cfederal government\u201d did not tell that lie! Barack Obama told 'em they could \u201ckeep what they got.\u201d)\n\nThe second contemporary lesson to be learned from the ObamaCare failures:\n\nEven the best technology security firewalls can be penetrated with the ease with which Chinese hackers have been browsing through classified DoD databases. And by no means would anyone describe the O'Care data hubs as having anything like the gauntlet of security protections at DoD. Those hubs host the mother lode of \u201cprivate\u201d information for theft or abuse.\n\nWhile your personal health care files, income tax returns and other personal profile information may not be of interest to the Chinese, they\u2019re certainly of interest to adolescent hackers, and much more ominously, identity thieves and those inside government who collect and disseminate information for Obama\u2019s \u201cenemies list.\u201d\n\nRegarding external threats, Henry Chao, Healthcare.gov\u2019s chief project manager at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), in his congressional testimony this week, said he was unaware of a memo from Tony Trenkle, lead tech officer for Healthcare.gov, warning, \u201cthe threat and risk potential [to the system] is limitless.\u201d When asked if he was surprised he had not seen the memo, Chao responded, \u201cYeah \u2026 I mean, wouldn\u2019t you be surprised if you were me? It is disturbing.\u201d\n\nJohn McAfee, founder of the world\u2019s largest computer security company, offered this assessment of the scope of the Healthcare.gov security problems: \u201cGlitch is a minor annoyance. This is a catastrophic failure, it is not a glitch. There was no security testing, no quality assurance and no system emigration.\u201d McAfee notes that there are now more than 700 sites successfully scamming those who mistakenly believe they\u2019re providing all that personal information to Healthcare.gov.\n\nCompounding the internal threats, it turns out that nowhere within the ACA\u2019s thousands of pages of laws and regulations is a simple requirement that ObamaCare\u2019s so-called \u201cnavigators\u201d must pass a criminal background check! When Texas Sen. John Cornyn asked HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius if \u201ca convicted felon could be a navigator and could acquire sensitive personal information from an individual unbeknownst to them,\u201d she responded, \u201cThis is possible.\u201d\n\n\u201cPossible\u201d? REALLY?\n\nOh, and let\u2019s not forget the \u201cinadvertent\u201d technology failures. For example, Minnesota O'Care exchange personnel sent 2,400 Social Security numbers to the wrong person four months ago, and a security audit determined that no corrective measures were in place to ensure that it didn\u2019t happen again.\n\nAnd what about compliance with the 1996 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act \u2013 which requires all those additional privacy forms you\u2019ve been signing since its passage? Title II of HIPAA, the so-called \u201cAdministrative Simplification\u201d provision, requires the establishment of national standards for electronic health care transactions and national identifiers for providers, health insurance plans and employers.\n\nIn other words, all your \u201cprivacy\u201d is now subject to far more compromise than ever before. The potential for HIPAA violations is also endless.\n\nObama is now desperate to mitigate the precipitous decline in both his approval and credibility ratings \u2013 especially among his own constituents. He will, of course, learn a hard truth during the remainder of his term: Reputation arrives on foot, but it leaves town on horseback.\n\nUndeterred, and speaking to some of his diehard admirers in Florida this week, a state now in third place for insurance cancellations, Obama claimed, \u201cI know health care is controversial, so there\u2019s only going to be so much support we get on that on a bipartisan basis \u2013 until it\u2019s working really well\u2026 If you just looked objectively at what the Democratic Party and Democratic senators stand for right now, it\u2019s a lot more aligned with what the American people believe and what they care about than what a small faction of the other party is trying to promote.\u201d\n\nHe has some great Florida swampland for sale, too!\n\nPro Deo et Constitutione \u2013 Libertas aut Mors\n\nSemper Fortis Vigilate Paratus et Fidelis", "article_metadata": {"description": "Actually More Lessons Ignored", "csrf-token": "KXF1eoqHvUwbT0cuCwzoy6qXEHnenHebz6AsEN/Nxjg=", "msapplication-TileColor": "#2b5797", "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "og": {"site_name": "The Patriot Post", "description": "&ldquo;The origin and outset of the American Republic, contain lessons of which posterity ought not to be deprived.&rdquo; &ndash;James Madison (1819)     As the list of Democrats distancing themselves from Barack Obama and his so-called &ldquo;Affordable Care Act&rdquo; continues to grow, Obama...", "title": "BO's 'Lessons Learned'?", "url": "http://patriotpost.us/alexander/21656", "image": "http://assets.patriotpost.us/images/2013-11-14-8c03c644.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100002378661032, "app_id": 217327155053459}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/mstile-144x144.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdda3c\"", "article_summary": "Alexander's Column BO's 'Lessons Learned'?\nWhile there are no old lessons to be learned from the continuing failures of nationalized health care, there are two very significant contemporary lessons.\nIf I want to keep the same health insurance, it\u2019s going to cost twice as much.\nTitle II of HIPAA, the so-called \u201cAdministrative Simplification\u201d provision, requires the establishment of national standards for electronic health care transactions and national identifiers for providers, health insurance plans and employers.\nThe health insurance exchanges processed only 106,000 signups in October, and fewer than 27,000 of those were through the 36 O'Care exchanges."}
