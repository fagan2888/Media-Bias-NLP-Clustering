Following a seven-month program developed by Prescriber\u2019s Letter drug advisory service, Quality Independent Physicians (QIP) successfully decreased patient hospitalization across all disease states by 26%. It also saw a 24% relative drop in discharges and a 7% relative decrease in 30-day hospital readmissions.\n\nQIP, a 50-physician accountable care organization (ACO), conducted the study. The organization treats 12,000 Medicare patients annually across Kentucky and Indiana. As a Medicare provider, QIP is required by CMS to report on a variety of strictly defined quality measures. Traditionally a fee-for-service industry, healthcare has shifted towards a quality-driven, pay-for-performance model as a result of the Affordable Care Act (ACA).\n\n\u201cAs an ACO, our organization is addressing these new challenges and opportunities head on by participating in the Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP),\u201d said QIP Medical Director Gregory A. Hood, MD, MACP. \u201cBecause key Medicare reimbursements are directly tied to quality metrics and related performance ratings, it is in everyone\u2019s best interest to focus on creating optimal patient outcomes across the entire continuum. As a result, better care as defined by CMS benefits both our patients\u2019 personal health and our practice\u2019s financial health.\u201d\n\nEffective medication management is a major determinant of quality scores. QIP\u2019s partnership with Prescriber\u2019s Letter strengthened its quality metrics through an integrated program of current medication management recommendations delivered at the point of care. It accomplished this by leveraging tools to align medication management enterprise-wide and brought about changes in prescriber behavior, when needed, as well as supported patient education.\n\n\u201cThere was a strong belief that a focus on medication management would have the greatest impact on our ability to meet CMS metrics,\u201d said Dr. Hood. \u201cBy delivering the latest drug information to the point of care, we were able to align medication management practices and related process throughout the ACO.\u201d\n\nThe effort focused on high-risk disease states specifically targeted for CMS reporting or directly related to key quality measures. These included COPD, heart failure, bacterial pneumonia, hypertension, anticoagulation, diabetes and acute coronary syndrome.\n\nReaching across the continuum, Prescriber\u2019s Letter provided customized, actionable educational resources. These included coverage of target diseases, online searchable medication management recommendations, drug comparison charts, physician training materials, and patient education handouts. All materials were incorporated into QIP standard policies, procedures and organizational culture.\n\nAfter seven months, metrics during the intervention were compared with a baseline prior to program implementation. \u201cAs we hoped, medication management, specifically the Prescriber\u2019s Letter solution, played a pivotal role in changing metrics and patient outcomes,\u201d said Dr. Hood. \u201cWe found a statistically significant improvement on all data reported to CMS on MSSP Utilization reports required for an ACO, which yields overall cost savings and higher reimbursements for the organization.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe success of the QIP study and the role Prescriber\u2019s Letter in those results underlines our focus on providing unbiased evidence-based information to the healthcare community,\u201d said Wes Crews, Chief Executive Officer of Therapeutic Research Center. \u201cStraightforward, concise information enables health systems and physician groups to streamline distribution across the entire organization, blending our information into clinician workflow. This allows providers, like QIP, to see a change in performance and a change in outcomes.\u201d\n\nAbout Therapeutic Research Center\n\nTherapeutic Research Center is a leading provider of digital advisory and education information solutions for drug therapy and medication management.
