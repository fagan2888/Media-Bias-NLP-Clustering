Indeed, data from these trials is almost certain to find its way into applications filed back in the United States with the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nDo large drug companies \u2013 which trade on U.S. domestic securities exchanges \u2013 accurately report complete information about drug trials conducted in China? Or do language barriers and cultural differences make it difficult \u2013 if not impossible \u2013 to secure unbiased results from these trials? Understanding that concepts imbedded in the western rule of law, including \u201cconflict of interest,\u201d \u201ckick back,\u201d and \u201cindependence,\u201d may have different meanings elsewhere is crucial to understanding the magnitude of the problem, and we have no way of answering these questions with complete certainty.\n\n\n\n\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe scary part is that our regulators \u2013 including the SEC, the FDA and the EPA \u2013 are so woefully understaffed that they lack the resources to fully enforce compliance in the United States, let alone on a global scale.\n\nIn a global economy, understanding and investigating conduct abroad is essential to domestic compliance enforcement. But triple the staff of domestic compliance enforcement agencies, and there still would not be enough government officials to enforce compliance in a global economy.\n\nThe truth is that since the founding of our republic, we have recognized that compliance enforcement cannot be left solely in the hands of government regulators. Compliance with our most fundamental constitutional protections, including the landmark decisions in Brown v Board of Education and New York Times v. Sullivan, have been accomplished through private party litigation \u2014 not government enforcement actions.\n\n\n\nOur environmental, antitrust, and civil rights laws have specific provisions allowing private citizens to bring enforcement actions. Our laws are constructed this way because we as a nation understand that substantive law absent an ability to enforce compliance is meaningless. To have an enumerated right or privilege that cannot be protected or secured is the same as having no right or privilege at all. To ensure compliance enforcement, we have created mechanisms that leverage our abilities so that culprits understand that being caught and sanctioned is more than a mere theoretical possibility. Indeed, Congress has passed laws, including the False Claims Act and the Dodd-Frank Act, that reward whistleblowers who bring to the government information about conduct that causes the wrongful payment of government monies and that lead to a recovery.\n\n\n\nThese laws tap the technical, cultural, and even language expertise of whistleblowers on both a domestic and global scale. In 2001, a German citizen named Kurt Bunk brought suit under the False Claims Act in a federal court in Virginia against freight companies engaging in a conspiracy \u2013 conceived in Europe \u2013 to elevate the cost of shipping services sold to the U.S. military. The case resulted in the recovery of millions of dollars to the U.S. Treasury. While not a U.S. citizen, Bunk\u2019s expertise in the shipping industry, his knowledge of the German language, his ability to review thousands of documents written in German, and his account of facts necessary to prove the wrongful conduct were essential to a domestic compliance effort.\n\nIt would seem obvious that individuals who participate in compliance enforcement that benefits U.S. citizens or U.S. regulatory agencies should minimally receive protection in our courts. At a time when our State Department spends millions of dollars abroad extolling the virtues of U.S. \u201crule of law,\u201d it would be ironic that a foreign citizen who aids in the enforcement of our laws would not be extended protection by our courts against retaliation. Yet, that is exactly what happened recently to Liu Meng-Lin, a citizen of Taiwan and a compliance officer for the healthcare division of Siemens China, Ltd.\n\n\n\nAccording to a lawsuit Liu filed in a New York federal court, he discovered that Siemens employees were indirectly making improper payments to officials in North Korea and China in connection with the sale of medical equipment to those countries. Liu complained internally, and was terminated, whereupon he reported to the SEC that Siemens had violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act \u2013 an Act that prohibits companies that trade stock on U.S. exchanges from making payments to foreign officials to secure business. Liu also alleged that Siemens had violated Dodd Frank\u2019s anti-retaliation provisions.\n\n\n\nThe federal court dismissed Liu\u2019s case, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit recently sustained that decision, refusing \u201cextraterritorial\u201d enforcement of the Dodd Frank anti-retaliation proscriptions. The Second Circuit found it of no consequence that Siemens trades its stock on U.S. exchanges \u2013 and presumably to U.S. purchasers \u2013 or that Liu may be entitled to a bounty from the SEC if the agency successfully pursues Siemens for FCPA violations. The Court justified its holding by maintaining that there is a presumption against extraterritorial application of a law where there is no clear congressional intent to do so.\n\n\n\nReally? In a global economy where the court conceded that Liu might actually be entitled to a monetary award from the SEC?\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s another irony: At a time when large corporations through the U.S. Chamber of Commerce are maintaining that whistleblowers should report their grievances to internal compliance personnel before going to regulatory bodies, a big publicly traded company has established \u2013 at least in one court \u2013 that foreigners have no rights of redress in U.S. courts if their internal disclosure results in retaliation.\n\nRegardless of whether the Second Circuit is correct in its analysis, its decision is a blow to whistleblower programs essential to enforcement of laws that, at the very least, protect those who reside within our domestic boundaries. If the Second Circuit is correct that Congress was not clear in its intent to protect foreigners who help in the enforcement of domestic laws, it is time for Congress to speak up.\n\nGuttman is a partner at the international litigation firm of Grant & Eisenhofer where he heads the firm\u2019s Washington, DC, office and its whistleblower practice.
