Judge Tapp said of his first participant, who\u2019s remained drug-free with Vivitrol, \u201cI\u2019m very proud of her.\u201d\n\nKentucky Circuit Judge David Tapp's frustration in dealing with repeat drug offenders sometimes shows when he presides at hearings in his court, as it did here in Pulaski County. Tapp advocates the use of the drug Vivitrol, which blocks the opioid receptors in the brain and prevents addicts from getting high from heroin or prescription drugs, as one means of treating addicts. (Photo: The Enquirer/Patrick Reddy) Story Highlights Vivitrol is a nonnarcotic pharmaceutical that prevents heroin or prescription painkiller abusers from getting high..Kentucky Circuit Court Judge David Tapp is piloting its use in his drug courts and a special probation program, serving Lincoln, Pulaski and Rockcastle counties \u2013 and witnessing success, so far.\n\nSuboxone sales climbing on the streets: Suboxone is a synthetic opiate that\u2019s used for heroin addicts to quell craving and stabilize the brain. The Kentucky State Police crime lab analyzed 739 submissions of buprenorphine, the generic form of Suboxone, in 2013, compared to 1,139 in 2014 \u2013 a 58 percent increase.\n\nJudge Tapp says he is seeing success with Vivitrol. Kentucky Administrative Office of the Courts is monitoring the program.\n\nWe all know heroin use is an epidemic in our area. But what are our local leaders and institutions doing \u2013 or not doing \u2013 to fight it? This year the Enquirer will be focusing on solutions to the region\u2019s heroin problems.\n\nA sliver of hope for heroin addicts could enter Northern Kentucky\u2019s drug courts, where judges have steadfastly said no to drugs to treat them \u2013 even in the face of scientific evidence that medicine often works best.\n\nThe hope is being touted by one of their own: a Kentucky drug court judge who is successfully using the non-narcotic drug Vivitrol to help prescription painkiller and heroin addicts in his court stay clean.\n\nKentucky Circuit Court Judge David Tapp, who serves Lincoln, Pulaski and Rockcastle counties, was in Northern Kentucky on Monday to describe his Vivitrol program to the region\u2019s drug court judges.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been using Vivitrol on a very small level here,\u201d said Tapp said from his Somerset courthouse Tuesday. \u201cIt seems to be working really well.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s Vivitrol?\n\nVivitrol is the injectable form of non-narcotic naltrexone. The FDA approved naltrexone in 2006 for treating opiate addiction and Vivitrol for monthly injection in 2010.\n\nIt\u2019s a pharmaceutical that blocks mu-opioid receptors so that heroin or prescription painkillers have no effect on their user. Vivitrol is prescribed by a physician, usually for patients who have had shorter-term heroin or opioid addiction. To take it safely, the patient first has to be detoxed from opioids or heroin.\n\nLike with other medicines used to treat heroin and opioid addiction, experts say Vivitrol works best when combined with counseling, and that\u2019s what Tapp\u2019s participants are getting.\n\nThe Kentucky Administrative Office of the Courts began working with Tapp on piloting the Vivitrol program in his drug court about eight months ago. Now officials are beginning to discuss its potential use in drug courts throughout the commonwealth. But they say it\u2019s too soon to make a decision.\n\nKentucky\u2019s House on Friday passed a bill expanding medical care for addicts, which provides funding for hospitals to supply patients with overdose kits when they are sent home.\n\nSince Northern Kentucky is so entrenched in the nationwide heroin epidemic, Tapp said it made sense to him to come and talk to judges in the region.\n\n\u201cI thought perhaps I\u2019d enlist their support.\u201d\n\nThe local drug court judges are just listening for now. But it\u2019s too early for them to agree to the regimen, they say.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m all for looking at it,\u201d said Campbell County District Judge Karen A. Thomas, the county\u2019s drug court judge.\n\nEven that is a switch from the usual mantra in Kentucky drug courts, which require participants to remain drug-free or be tapered off of physician-recommended and prescribed medicines used to stabilize them within six months. The programs use abstinence-based recovery methods.\n\nThe Kentucky drug court policy states judges can use their discretion and allow \u2013 or forbid \u2013 the use of medically supervised detoxification or treatment for up to six months. The courts system says the narcotic treatments interfere with their drug-testing, and that experts have told them those taking the drugs can safely and medically taper off them within six months.\n\nBut the abstinence programs that have great success for alcoholism, for example, fail miserably for most heroin and opioid addicts. A startling number of those \u2013 between 95 and 98 percent \u2013 who are assigned to abstinence programs fail to remain clean.\n\nVivitrol is, then, middle ground for judges who want to help addicts but are opposed to synthetic opiate replacements and offering, well, no medical treatment.\n\nSuboxone stigma,\n\nand street sales\n\n\u201cSuboxone and methadone \u2013 they\u2019re just legalized narcotics,\u201d Campbell County\u2019s Thomas said.\n\nBoth drugs are used \u2013 frequently with success \u2013 to keep addicts off of heroin by reducing cravings, preventing withdrawal symptoms and stabilizing them. But they come with a stigma, because they\u2019re synthetic opiates.\n\nSuboxone, the brand drug of the generic buprenorphine, is often prescribed in take-home doses, making it easier for addicts to live a normal life \u2013 but also fueling its illegal sales on the street.\n\nThe street sales are evident throughout the state. And buprenorphine submissions to the Kentucky State Police crime laboratory are skyrocketing, just as overdoses and deaths from heroin are climbing. The lab analyzed 739 submissions in 2013, compared to 1,139 in 2014 \u2013 a 58 percent increase in cases where officers either seized the drug or bought it during a drug investigation.\n\nVan Ingram, executive director of the Office of Drug Control Policy, said most of the street-sales of buprenorphine are happening in regions outside of Northern Kentucky.\n\nSome people are selling the take-home strips of Suboxone for financial gain, some are sharing the drug, some people may be getting prescribed more than they need, Ingram said. One heroin addict told the Enquirer in 2012 she was using Suboxone from the street as she tried to wean herself from heroin to temper dope sickness that comes with withdrawal.\n\nTapp said the courts see evidence of diverted Suboxone in drug tests for inmates, and that\u2019s why judges don\u2019t want it in their court programs.\n\nDr. Mina \u201cMike\u201d Kalfas, a Northern Kentucky physician and certified addiction specialist who has been prescribing Suboxone for 12 years, said that most addicts using it illegally are trying to self-medicate to avoid withdrawal.\n\nIn fact, part of the illegal sale of Suboxone in Northern Kentucky is attributed to the fact that not enough physicians in the region prescribe the drug, leaving heroin addicts to seek it from those who do have a prescription.\n\nKentucky courts aren\u2019t the only ones that spurn the use of Suboxone and methadone. Ohio\u2019s Hamilton County Drug Court is another court adhering to abstinence for participants. Warren County Common Pleas Court, on the other hand, has been allowing Vivitrol for some inmates.\n\n\u2018Hard-nosed\u2019 judge\n\nwelcomes Vivitrol\n\nTapp describes himself as a \u201chard-nosed\u201d judge and says even he was a skeptic when he first heard about Vivitrol.\n\nBut Tapp learned last spring about how it could be used in Kentucky\u2019s courts system. By summer, he had put protocols in place for its use in his drug court, along with requirements for use in a special probation program. By Sept. 16, 2014, Tapp found his first candidate for the medicine.\n\nDeedra Shipp, 25, of Stanford, says she started using drugs when she was 14.\n\n\u201cHer record was horrible. She\u2019d been in jail several months. I had her tested, right there, and she was positive for everything \u2013 opiates, marijuana. She was using in jail,\u201d Tapp said.\n\nHer attorney made an argument to keep her out of prison, and Tapp thought: \u201cMaybe she\u2019s a good person to start with Vivitrol.\u201d\n\nHe had Shipp transported from Lincoln County to Pulaski County, where a doctor met with her and decided she was, in fact, a good candidate for the pharmaceutical.\n\nShe\u2019s been getting a Vivitrol injection once a month. And she hasn\u2019t fallen back into illegal drug use.\n\n\u201cSince I\u2019ve been on Vivitrol, I\u2019ve been sober on my own for the first time in 11 years,\u201d Shipp said.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s been drug-tested 12 to 14 times a month. She\u2019s had zero positive drug screens. She is employed,\u201d Tapp said, ticking off one success after another for the young woman and concluding with a chuckle, \u201cShe\u2019s doing good!\u201d\n\nTapp said defendants and their attorneys who enter his court may ask about Vivitrol as an effort to stay off drugs and out of prison. Some are people who no longer want to be on Suboxone, he said. Others have repeatedly relapsed from abstinence-based therapy.\n\n\u201cWe provide them with literature and make arrangements for them to meet with a physician,\u201d Tapp said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always a medical decision.\u201d\n\nKenton County Circuit Judge Gregory Bartlett, a drug court judge, was out of town when Tapp visited but met with him a couple of weeks ago at a circuit court judges meeting.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know a whole lot about Vivitrol,\u201d Bartlett said. \u201cI\u2019m interested in looking into its use.\u201d\n\nLikewise, Boone County Circuit Judge James Schrand, who heads that county\u2019s drug court, said he found Tapp\u2019s experience with Vivitrol interesting.\n\n\u201cWith the way the epidemic is, we want to look at all of our options,\u201d Schrand said. But again, he said it\u2019s too soon to say the Northern Kentucky drug court judges are even considering its use.\n\nBut there is interest in Vivitrol elsewhere in Northern Kentucky.\n\nCampbell County Judge-executive Steve Pendery, whose county is designing plans for a substance abuse program for its jail, has invited Tapp back to Northern Kentucky to meet with the county jail staff.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m interested in hearing his experience with Vivitrol,\u201d Pendery said. \u201cWe have to learn more so that we can create a program that offers the hope of success,\u201d Pendery said.\n\nOne county over, Kenton County Judge-executive Kris Knochelmann expressed interest in Tapp\u2019s program after hearing the judge was in Northern Kentucky last week.\n\n\u201cAny movement in this area is good,\u201d he said.\n\nTapp said the cost of his program isn\u2019t much, despite the fact that Vivitrol shots cost about $1,000 per month. The medicine is covered under Medicaid and some private insurance companies. The court helps participants enroll for insurance, and the makers of Vivitrol have provided the first dose free for now to drug-court candidates.\n\nThe court pays for a single pill dose of naltrexone, at about $5 per pill, for each Vivitrol candidate to ensure they are detoxed before starting the injections.\n\nDoes Vivitrol work?\n\nEvery heroin addict is different, and every treatment plan should be individualized.\n\nKalfas said he\u2019s had about a 30 percent to 50 percent success rate with Vivitrol, and he uses numerous factors to decide whether a patient is a good candidate for the drug. The odds of success go up to about 70 percent when the person remains sober for the first three months they\u2019re injected with it, he said.\n\nDr. Adam Bisaga, professor of psychiatry at Columbia University Medical Center\u2019s Department of Psychiatry Division on Substance Abuse, said the effectiveness of office-based Vivitrol is similar to that of office-based Suboxone, with 50 percent of patients still in treatment at six months. But success, he noted, \u201creally depends on many factors.\u201d\n\nLike with other medicines for opiate and opioid addiction, the length of use of Vivitrol varies depending on the addict\u2019s need. The Enquirer has interviewed patients who remained on it for a year before going without it successfully. Some physicians say Vivitrol should be used for at least three months, but some patients are on it for a few years.\n\nTapp made it clear he isn\u2019t touting Vivitrol as the answer to the heroin epidemic.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no one magic bullet. I just don\u2019t think there\u2019s only one solution,\u201d the judge said. \u201cWhat we need are different arrows in the quiver.\u201d\n\nVivitrol: A nonnarcotic pharmaceutical that blocks mu-opioid receptors so that opiates such as heroin or opioids will not provide any effect. Generally prescribed for patients who have had shorter-term heroin or opioid addiction. It is given by injection monthly.\n\nSuboxone: A synthetic opiate that partially fills the brain\u2019s mu-opioid receptors. It reduces cravings and prevents withdrawal symptoms. It also blocks euphoric effects of opiates such as heroin and opioids such as prescription painkillers. Generally used for individuals who\u2019ve had shorter-term heroin or opioid addiction. It is prescribed by physicians and can be taken in a pill or dissolving film form.\n\nNaloxone/Narcan: Naloxone is the generic form of Narcan, a drug that is injected or sprayed into the nostrils to revive people who have overdosed on heroin or opioids. It causes almost immediate withdrawal and restores normal breathing in the patient, reviving him or her.\n\nMethadone: A synthetic opiate that completely fills the mu-opioid receptors in the brain. It reduces cravings and prevents withdrawal symptoms. It is regulated in the body to stabilize the patient so he or she functions well without euphoric effects. Generally used for individuals who\u2019ve had long-term heroin or opioid addiction. It is provided in a highly structured and federally regulated clinic setting in a liquid form.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://cjky.it/1EeigZ4", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "A Ky. judge tells NKY judges of success with non-narcotic Vivitrol in his drug court.", "og": {"site_name": "The Courier-Journal", "description": "A Ky. judge tells NKY judges of success with non-narcotic Vivitrol in his drug court.", "title": "KY judge sees medical hope for opiate addicts", "url": "http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/local/2015/02/15/ky-judge-sees-medical-hope-opiate-addicts/23458121/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/courier-journal.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A Ky. judge tells NKY judges of success with non-narcotic Vivitrol in his drug court.", "title": "KY judge sees medical hope for opiate addicts", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6f8788fc0c6dabf6577afec937146ad0d39afdf8/c=732-0-2364-1632&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Louisville/2015/02/15/B9316260311Z.1_20150215145638_000_GB49UUF8C.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@courierjournal", "site": "@courierjournal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600030236", "fb": {"app_id": 128534137209813}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Subjects/Alcoholism", "gci-asset-type": "data", "gci-categories": "Subjects/Alcoholism", "title": "KY judge sees medical hope for opiate addicts", "author": "Terry DeMio", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/local", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/86a001ef7c1fb09b3e085a92ffb6548ddc91b047/c=936-0-2160-1632/local/-/media/Louisville/2015/02/15/B9316260311Z.1_20150215145638_000_GB49UUF8C.1-0.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e79960eee32808546af47069fe5399d1cf233e16/c=732-0-2364-1632/local/-/media/Louisville/2015/02/15/B9316260311Z.1_20150215145638_000_GB49UUF8C.1-0.jpg", "contenttype": "data", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d9916e50c9573035a58858c95c3304c83cd2a924/c=460-0-2636-1632/local/-/media/Louisville/2015/02/15/B9316260311Z.1_20150215145638_000_GB49UUF8C.1-0.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/50614f320fb75b1a6b8d76d8a791ec8c84b39b24/c=98-0-2999-1632&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/Louisville/2015/02/15/B9316260311Z.1_20150215145638_000_GB49UUF8C.1-0.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-02-15T14:57:13.247000-05:00", "shorthed": "KY judge sees promise in Vivitrol", "articleid": 23458121, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/de7b473d12fbc80ce2eb011f795ec7f95182a117/c=98-0-2999-1632/local/-/media/Louisville/2015/02/15/B9316260311Z.1_20150215145638_000_GB49UUF8C.1-0.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/73d1c747e5b0df994adca4fd3f9bdab838835593/c=1089-0-2007-1632/local/-/media/Louisville/2015/02/15/B9316260311Z.1_20150215145638_000_GB49UUF8C.1-0.jpg"}}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9fa3\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI\u2019m all for looking at it,\u201d said Campbell County District Judge Karen A.
