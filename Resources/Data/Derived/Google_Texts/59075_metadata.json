Medical benefits are slated to go up by 16 percent in the coming school year, she said.\n\nThe $3 million rise in spending is equal to a 2.4 percent increase in tax-supported spending, above the state\u2019s so-called \u201c2 percent cap.\u201d Perkins said that\u2019s allowed because the district spending was below the cap during the last two years.\n\nThe picture is less dire than it may appear, Perkins said, because the district\u2019s taxes for debt service are going down. Factoring in the decrease, the owner of a house assessed at the city average of $171,000 would pay an additional $81 a year in property taxes under the proposed budget.\n\nTrustees unanimously supported the budget, if reluctantly. Jim Daley, the finance committee chairman, said before Perkins\u2019 presentation that his committee would work to whittle the budget down before its final approval.\n\n\u201cFor me, it\u2019s got to be 2 percent or under,\u201d Daley said about the tax increase.\n\nBoard President Gary Passenti said trustees were reviewing health-insurance costs in a special committee. He said the district should consider shopping for better rates and combining with the city to increase the pool of insured workers.\n\nPassenti also repeated a call often made by local officials for more state aid to the district.\n\n\u201cOur surrounding districts get multi-million dollars but we get pennies on the dollar,\u201d he said.\n\nState aid remained flat this year at $26 million.\n\nNo new major initiatives are funded under the proposed budget, aside from boiler replacements at Schools 3, 4, 5, 9 and 11, and new roofs at Schools 3 and 16. One of the boilers is 89-years-old and long overdue for a replacement, trustees said.\n\n\u201cNone of us would step on an airplane that\u2019s 89-years-old,\u201d said trustee Michael Evans.\n\nEmail: greenj@northjersey.com", "article_metadata": {"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "The city school board introduced a $158.7 million budget for 2015-16 that would for the first time in several years increase property taxes beyond a state-imposed limit.", "copyright": "North Jersey Media Group Inc.", "author": "JEFF GREEN", "og": {"url": "http://www.northjersey.com/cm/2.1593/news/clifton-schools-budget-would-increase-property-taxes-beyond-state-limit-1.1292991", "site_name": "NorthJersey.com", "image": "http://www.northjersey.com/designimages/NorthJerseyFacebook_377x196.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The city school board introduced a $158.7 million budget for 2015-16 that would for the first time in several years increase property taxes beyond a state-imposed limit."}, "title": "Clifton schools budget would increase property taxes beyond state limit", "robots": "noarchive,noodp,noydir", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=446490632", "fb": {"admins": "100002050123125,739916158,1235266096", "app_id": 130358300392751}, "DC.creator": "JEFF GREEN", "msvalidate.01": "697A26605161B513EFE2AD6E581F4AA8", "google-site-verification": "swyvR_LXSGMOxOz1638gujs38OoVP3sZwJgdjySjnXM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=2.0, user-scalable=yes", "DC.title": "Clifton schools budget would increase property taxes beyond state limit"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce2c7\"", "article_summary": "CLIFTON \u2013 The city school board introduced a $158.7 million budget for 2015-16 that would for the first time in several years increase property taxes beyond a state-imposed limit.\nThe picture is less dire than it may appear, Perkins said, because the district\u2019s taxes for debt service are going down.\nThe district\u2019s business administrator, Karen Perkins, said during a presentation this week that the district needed to increase taxes by $3 million, made necessary mostly by sharp rises in health insurance costs.\nHe said the district should consider shopping for better rates and combining with the city to increase the pool of insured workers.\nJim Daley, the finance committee chairman, said before Perkins\u2019 presentation that his committee would work to whittle the budget down before its final approval."}
