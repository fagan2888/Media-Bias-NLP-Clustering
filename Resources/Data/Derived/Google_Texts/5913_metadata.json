Take all the money out and make it impotent.\u201d\n\nEver since the GOP took control of the Senate in the midterm elections, the Obamacare/reconciliation debate has always been aimed squarely at influencing the presidential election. Pursuing repeal through budget reconciliation would allow Republicans in the Senate to obviate a Democratic filibuster and send the measure to President Obama\u2019s desk, where it would be promptly vetoed. Then the Republicans would take their argument to the people and say that a repeal of the healthcare law is indeed possible, but only if they elect a Republican president (and reelect a Republican Senate) in 2016.\n\nRick Santorum is obviously ready to make the case. All he needs is for Republicans in Congress to actually get around to using reconciliation to take on the Affordable Care Act. But the GOP leaders in the House and Senate \u2013 their stated urgency to kill Obamacare notwithstanding \u2013 don\u2019t seem to be in any sort of hurry.\n\nA couple of weeks ago I wrote about how the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in King v. Burwell put a huge kink in the GOP\u2019s plans to repeal Obamacare. They were clearly banking on the court\u2019s conservative justices to blow up the law and do most of their dirty work for them, but that didn\u2019t happen, and so full responsibility for repeal devolved to Congress. After the decision came down, conservatives in the House renewed their push to go forward with repeal through reconciliation, as prescribed by the House- and Senate-passed budget resolutions. But key Republicans on the relevant committees demurred and suggested that they may not meet the self-imposed July 24 deadline for submitting language that would repeal portions of the ACA.\n\nWell, this week House majority leader Kevin McCarthy confirmed what everyone already suspected: Repeal through reconciliation will be put on hold for the foreseeable future. As reported by The Hill:\n\nMcCarthy acknowledged Republicans will miss Friday\u2019s deadline to outline plans for reconciliation, though he dismissed the deadline as more of a guideline than a mandate. \u201cWe will not put anything out by July 24. It\u2019s not a hard and fast deadline,\u201d McCarthy said. [\u2026] McCarthy said a bill to repeal ObamaCare could come in September, but wouldn\u2019t commit to the possibility. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a reason why we have to hurry. So you will see something later,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cIt\u2019s something we need to do and we will, but it\u2019s not by July 24.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Kevin McCarthy says the GOP's Obamacare repeal scheme will be delayed until some time later.
