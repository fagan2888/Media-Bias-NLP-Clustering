It\u2019s bleeding value every week.\n\nYour dream of early retirement is history. You\u2019ve lost so much money in stocks that even a \"regular\" retirement is in jeopardy. If you live a long life, there\u2019s no way you\u2019ll have enough money.\n\nThis is the financial-disaster scenario that terrifies a lot of investors.\n\nIt\u2019s what kept people up at night during the 2008 credit crisis.\n\nThese days, everyone likes to read and talk about the dangers of another financial crisis.\n\nCould something like 2008 happen again? Could another crisis cause the value of the U.S. dollar to collapse? Could the banking system seize up overnight?\n\nMany brilliant people say the answer to these questions is \"yes.\"\n\nFortunately, I don\u2019t need to know the answer to these questions\u2026and neither do you.\n\nThe good news is that it\u2019s very easy to buy insurance against financial disasters like these. I personally own this insurance.\n\nMany of the smartest, wealthiest people I know own it, too. It could mean the difference between a comfortable, early retirement\u2026and just barely getting by. And part of owning this insurance - and potentially making millions of dollars in the next crisis - involves owning one of the market\u2019s riskiest investments.\n\nIt\u2019s a strange turn of events that I\u2019ll explain shortly\u2026\n\nThe Ultimate Insurance Against Financial Disaster\n\n\u2022 First, let\u2019s agree on what \u201cinsurance\u201d is\u2026\n\nIn my book, buying insurance comes down to spending a little bit of money to hedge yourself against a disaster.\n\nThroughout our lives, we spend a little bit of money on insurance and hope we never have to use it.\n\nFor example, home insurance costs a small fraction of your home\u2019s value. You buy it and hope you never have to use it.\n\nThe same goes for car insurance. It costs a fraction of your car\u2019s value, so you buy it and hope you never have to use it.\n\nIt\u2019s the same with \u201cwealth insurance.\u201d\n\nYou can buy wealth insurance and hope you never have to use it.\n\nThere are hundreds of wealth-insurance policies out there. They involve intricate details, lots of forms to sign, and payments of big fees to advisors and salesmen (which are often the same thing).\n\nBut I\u2019d rather keep things simple and keep money in my pocket instead of putting it in a salesman\u2019s pocket. You might be in the same boat.\n\nHere\u2019s how we can do it\u2026\n\nPut a small portion of our wealth in gold bullion.\n\nThat\u2019s it.\n\nThat\u2019s all it takes to get wealth insurance\u2026and protect your family against a financial disaster.\n\nYou don\u2019t need complicated insurance products. You don\u2019t need to pay big fees to a salesman. Just pay a small commission to a gold seller, store the gold in a safe place, and you\u2019re done.\n\n\u2022 Here\u2019s why this \"insurance\" is important\u2026\n\nSome very smart people are predicting a global depression, a collapse in the dollar, and a huge increase in the price of gold.\n\nFor example, Seth Klarman is a legendary investor. He\u2019s probably the smartest financial mind you\u2019ve never heard of. Klarman is warning that the Federal Reserve\u2019s low-interest-rate policy has distorted the financial markets\u2026and is setting us up for disaster.\n\nKlarman and others bring up good points. The U.S. government is spending way too much money on wars, Obamacare, welfare, and other programs. Europe\u2019s and China\u2019s economies could decline and trigger a global recession. These are all real risks to your retirement account.\n\nEven if you\u2019re more optimistic and think things will be fine, I think you\u2019ll agree that it makes sense to own some insurance in case a financial disaster strikes.\n\nPeople would likely flock to gold in a global financial disaster\u2026and cause its price to soar. For example, the decade from 1970 to 1980 was marked by war, recession, and very high inflation. This made the 1970s a terrible decade for stocks and bonds. But it was terrific for gold owners. As people fled stocks for precious metals, gold gained more than 2,000% during decade.\n\nThat\u2019s why it makes sense to buy gold as a form of insurance.\n\nThe good news is that you don\u2019t have to buy a huge amount of gold to have a good insurance policy. You can place just 5% of your portfolio into gold.\n\nIts place in your portfolio could mean a huge difference in your family struggling to get by\u2026or doing well.\n\nHow a Gold Position Could Make You Wealthy During a Crisis\n\n\u2022 Let\u2019s say you have a $100,000 portfolio with 95% of it in blue-chip stocks and income-paying bonds.\n\nYou place the remaining 5% of your portfolio into gold. This gives you $95,000 in stocks and bonds, and $5,000 in gold.\n\nIf the predicted financial disaster doesn\u2019t strike, your stocks and bonds will increase in value.\n\nYour gold will probably hold steady in price or decline a little. Since the bulk of your portfolio is in stocks and bonds, you\u2019ll do just fine.\n\nBut what if the financial disaster strikes? I\u2019ve heard some top analysts say gold could climb to $7,000 an ounce in a financial disaster scenario.\n\nLet\u2019s say a financial disaster sends the value of your stocks and bonds down 50%. That would be a massive decline. Throughout history, only the worst, most severe bear markets sent stocks down this much.\n\nThis epic financial disaster would cut your $95,000 position in stocks and bonds by 50%, leaving you with $47,500. But let\u2019s say this disaster also causes gold to rise to $7,000 an ounce. Right now, gold is $1,150 per ounce. A rise to $7,000 would produce a more-than-sixfold increase in the value of your gold. It would cause the value of your $5,000 gold stake to rise to about $30,435.\n\nPost-financial disaster, you\u2019d be left with $77,935 ($47,500 from stocks and bonds + $30,435 from gold).\n\nThe disaster still would hit you, but not nearly as hard. Your insurance would play a big role in limiting the damage.\n\nBut what if you think the chances of financial disaster are higher than \u201cunlikely\u201d?\n\nWhat if you\u2019re more worried than the average Joe?\n\nIf you are, simply increase the \"insurance\" portion of your portfolio. Instead of a 5% position in gold, you could increase it to 20%.\n\nIf the previously mentioned financial disaster were to strike your $100,000 portfolio weighted 80% in stocks/bonds and 20% in gold, the math work out like this:\n\nThe 50% decline in your $80,000 stocks/bonds position would leave you with $40,000. Gold\u2019s increase to $7,000 an ounce would increase your $20,000 gold position to $121,739\n\nYour large gold-insurance position actually would produce a net gain in this scenario. You\u2019d be left with $161,739\u2026an increase of over 60%.\n\n\u2022 As you can see, the larger your gold-insurance policy, the better you would do in a financial-disaster scenario.\n\nBut if the financial disaster doesn\u2019t strike, you won\u2019t benefit as much, because you hold less money in stocks and bonds, which do well if the economy carries on.\n\nAnd keep in mind\u2026it would take a serious financial disaster to send stocks down by 50% and gold up to $7,000.\n\nDepending on what you think the chances of a financial disaster are, you can adjust your gold-insurance policy. It all depends on your goals and beliefs.\n\nThink the chances of disaster are slim? Consider a gold-insurance policy equivalent to 1%-5% of your portfolio. Think the chances of disaster are high? Consider a gold-insurance policy equivalent to 20% of your portfolio.\n\nIs financial disaster around the corner? I don\u2019t know the answer.\n\nNobody does.\n\nBut if you buy some \"wealth insurance\" in the form of gold, you don\u2019t need to know the answer. It\u2019s simple. It\u2019s easy. It\u2019s low-cost.\n\nYou buy gold and hope you never have to use it. You\u2019ll do fine if things carry on. You\u2019ll do fine if the crap hits the fan.\n\nAnd the peace of mind you get from owning gold \"insurance\" is worth even more than the money it could save you.\n\nHow to Amplify Gold\u2019s Power to Create Wealth\n\nYou might have heard some advisors say that if gold soars in value during a crisis, the companies that mine gold could soar even more.\n\nThat\u2019s because when the price of a natural resource doubles, triples, or quadruples in price, the profit margins of the companies that produce the natural resource can skyrocket.\n\nFor example, let\u2019s say you own a gold-mining company. Your company can produce gold for $800 per ounce. Let\u2019s also say the current selling price for gold is $1,000 per ounce. This means your profit margin is $200 per ounce.\n\nNow let\u2019s say the price of gold rises from $1,000 per ounce to $2,000 per ounce. This is a 100% increase in the price of gold. But your company\u2019s profit margin just soared from $200 per ounce to $1,200 per ounce\u2026a 500% increase.\n\nThis kind of financial magic is called leverage\u2026and it can produce incredible stock market gains.\n\nFor example, from 2002 to 2008, the price of gold climbed from $300 per ounce to $1,000 per ounce.\n\nDuring this time, leading gold company Kinross Gold climbed from $2.25 per share to nearly $27 per share (a 1,093% gain). Another gold company, Yamana Gold, climbed from around $1.53 a share to more than $19 per share (a 1,165% gain). The gains were so great in this market that a simple gold stock index gained 692%!\n\nThese types of gains are impressive. But please keep in mind that these companies are also very risky. They are some of the riskiest stocks in the entire market. That\u2019s because mining is a capital-intensive business. The firms have no control over their product. When gold falls in price, these companies can fall more than 80% in a short time.\n\nBut if a financial crisis forces the value of gold much higher, and paper currencies much lower, these companies could rise 500%\u20261,000%\u2026or more.\n\nThat\u2019s why it can make sense to make them part of your \"wealth insurance\" position.\n\nStock Options that Will Pay Off Big if the Dollar Crashes\n\n\u2022 Around the office, we often say these firms are like stock options that will pay off big in a financial crisis. And they are stock options that don\u2019t expire.\n\nAs you may know, a stock option is a type of security that offers massive upside. And we\u2019re not talking about \u201conly 100%\u201d upside.\n\nStock options can return 10, 20, even 50 times your original investment.\n\nIt\u2019s not uncommon for traders to turn $10,000 into $250,000 with well-placed option trades.\n\n\u2022 But while buying options gives you the potential to make giant gains, they come with some negatives, too.\n\nThe biggest one is that options have finite life spans. For example, you might buy an option contract in January that expires in June. If the outcome you expect doesn\u2019t happen by June (known as the \u201cexpiration date\u201d), the value of your option will be worthless, and you\u2019ll lose 100% of the capital you place in the trade.\n\nThe best mining stocks have the same upside as stock options. It\u2019s not uncommon for professional mining-stock investors to turn $10,000 into $250,000 by buying the right stock at the right time.\n\nHowever, these miners are actual businesses. They don\u2019t \"expire\" like option contracts do. The right miners have plenty of cash on hand to fund their operations\u2026which allows you to hold these stocks for years and get exposure to their incredible upside potential. (It\u2019s worth mentioning that Seth Klarman - the legendary investor I mentioned earlier - owns a large amount of small-cap gold firm NovaGold.)\n\nBecause the upside of these stock options that never expire is so great, placing just a small amount of your portfolio in them can produce incredible gains if gold increases in price.\n\nPlacing just 1% or 2% of your portfolio in these stocks can result in a huge positive change to your overall net worth.\n\nThe Right Time to Buy Insurance Is When It\u2019s Dirt-Cheap\n\n\u2022 Finally, we come to the ideal time to buy these stocks.\n\nBuying at the right time is how you set yourself up for 500%\u20261,000%\u2026even 2,000% returns.\n\nThe ideal time to buy these stocks is after huge busts.\n\nGold-mining stocks are cyclical. This means they go through huge booms and busts.\n\nOne year, they will advance by 50%. The next year, they will advance another 50%. The year after that, they will plummet by 60%.\n\nThis boom and bust price action is in stark contrast with the steadier price action of \"non-cyclical\" stocks like fast-food chain McDonald\u2019s\u2026or health care giant Johnson & Johnson.\n\n\u2022 The only way to make money in the sector is to buy near the bottoms\u2026and sell near the tops.\n\nYou must buy these assets when prices are so low that the public can\u2019t stand the thought of owning them (when they are cheap).\n\nAs my friend and legendary natural resource investor Rick Rule often says, \u201cYou\u2019re either a contrarian or a victim.\u201d\n\nThe chart below shows how powerful this idea can be. It displays the past 20 years of the most widely used gold-stock index (the \"HUI\").\n\nYou can see how it goes through huge booms and busts. The booms are good for hundreds-of-percent gains. The busts result in huge losses\u2026\n\nIf you look at the right side of this chart, you can see that there has been a giant bust in gold stocks. Global central banks have been able to make it seem like all is well with the global financial system\u2026and the HUI has lost 79% of its value since its 2011 peak.\n\nMost investors see this and turn away in disgust. But many sophisticated investors see it as a \"fire sale\" for these assets that could soar during a currency crisis.\n\nIf the global central bank experiment ends badly, the value of paper currencies will continue to plummet. The value of \"real money\" (gold) will soar. And buying these \"stock options that never expire\" now, while they are dirt-cheap, could end up looking like a genius move.\n\n\u2022 In summary, gold is the ultimate form of wealth insurance. I buy it and hope to never have to use it. It\u2019s a vital part of my overall wealth plan. I hope it\u2019s part of yours.\n\nAnd a basket of carefully selected gold-mining stocks could pay off in a big way if world governments continue to devalue our money.\n\nInternational Speculator is our advisory focused on the best small gold stocks with huge upside potential.
