(WOOD) \u2014 U.S. Rep. Fred Upton stopped by \u201cTo The Point\u201d this week to talk about what\u2019s going on in Washington; from the visit of a foreign dignitary to the House of Representative to what could happen to the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe Republican from St. Joseph also talked about the showdown on funding for the Department of Homeland Security.\n\n\u201cThis issue itself goes back to the immigration issue, which the president did this by executive order,\u201d Upton said. \u201cI\u2019m one who believes that yes, we need immigration reform, but we need to work; it needs to be a legislative solution versus an executive order. So the president was wrong in doing this.\u201d\n\n\u201cA federal judge ruled that the president\u2019s executive order should not be able to stand. It\u2019s now been a couple weeks they haven\u2019t been; the appeal is not overturned,\u201d Upton continued. \u201cWhat this one federal judge did down in Texas \u2014 I\u2019m not a lawyer, but my sense is that that order, the current order, will stay for months to come bookcase the argument. Even the president himself said 22 times he didn\u2019t have the authority to do what he ultimately did.\u201d\n\nAbove, Upton talks about immigration, the difference between Republicans and the president on foreign policy, and more on this March 15, 2015 episode of \u201cTo The Point.\u201d\n\nShare this: Email\n\nPrint\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle\n\nPinterest\n\nMore\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\n\n\nReddit\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "U.S. Rep.
