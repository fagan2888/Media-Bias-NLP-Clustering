She\u2019d prefer we call her writing \u201cspeculative fiction\u201d (in a move dismissed by Ursula K. Le Guin as \u201cdesigned to protect her novels from being relegated to a genre still shunned by hidebound readers, reviewers and prize-awarders\u201d); regardless, it\u2019s clear that the author of \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d (1985) is still fond of a good dystopia. This past May, she wrapped up her Orwellian Web serial, \u201cPositron,\u201d on Byliner.com, and her just-published novel, \u201cMaddAddam,\u201d concludes a hefty near-future trilogy that started with \u201cOryx and Crake\u201d (2003) and \u201cThe Year of the Flood\u201d (2009).\n\nThe trilogy concerns \u201cthe Waterless Flood\u201d: the mass extinction of humanity brought about by the rogue geneticist Crake so that his creations, the Crakers (like humans, but idealized pacifists), may inherit the Earth. A few humans survive, eking out a parlous existence in a rundown world; by the end, they\u2019re repurposing bedsheets as clothes. At the center of \u201cMaddAddam\u201d is Zeb, a leather-jacket-wearing, wisecracking outlaw hacker who becomes a patriarch in a doomsday cult that, fittingly enough, ends up well prepared to survive the Flood.\n\nZeb also makes up bawdy songs, and despite the book\u2019s bleakness, it\u2019s often very funny. So, too, is Atwood herself. On a sunny summer day, she\u2019s curled up with a coffee in a corner of a cafe near her Toronto home to meet journalists; she has a perpetual quarter-smile, an amused stare, and the deadpan air of a raconteur whose disconcerting tales are laced with dark humor. In SF, she has found a form that suits her voracious reading and the breadth of her interests. \u201cMaddAddam\u201d alone takes up religion, education, evolution, punishment and ubiquitous government surveillance. As I put my recorder down in front of her, she says, \u201cIt can join all the other little devices that are circling over our heads.\u201d She looks up to the sky. \u201cHello! Enjoy the interview!\u201d\n\nAs the trilogy is set in a potential near future, did you have to rethink certain ideas along the way from writing \u201cOryx and Crake\u201d to \u201cMaddAddam\u201d as technology changed?\n\nWell, since I depicted them as already happening, it was probably more of a challenge for the reader. Things pile onto my Twitter. The lab-meat hamburger which appears in this book? It\u2019s here. The genetically modified pigs? They\u2019ve actually blended human DNA with pig DNA at the egg level, and the resulting animals are surprisingly loaded up with human DNA.\n\nFrom the time when you began the trilogy, did any technological change surpass what you were writing about?\n\nYeah, in \u201cOryx and Crake,\u201d in the libraries, Jimmy\u2019s job is to throw out paper books and put things on CD-ROM. [Now] it would be the Cloud. Though you never know; they still have a lot of stuff on microfiche. I think every age lives in a blend of technology so there\u2019s always older ones mixed in with newer ones, and when the new technology goes down, the immediate fallback position is either that technology just before that or one several technologies back.\n\nLike books.\n\nExactly. And books are good for a couple of things: No. 1: They\u2019re still readable when the Cloud goes down. No. 2: They make great kindling.\n\nThe word \u201cKindle\u201d takes on new meaning \u2013\n\nRight! No. 3: Push comes to shove, they\u2019re great insulating material. You could make a little igloo out of books if you really had to. I think of them as a form of carbon sequestration \u2013 all the CO2 is tied up in books. They don\u2019t decay for a long time, if you bury them deep enough. It has to be below the ant level.\n\n\u201cMaddAddam\u2019s\u201d narrator, Toby, writes down her experiences on paper, so the book itself does take on an importance.\n\nCommunications technology changes possibilities for communication, but that doesn\u2019t mean it changes the inherited structure of the brain. So you may think that you\u2019re addicted to online reading, but as soon as it isn\u2019t available anymore, your brain will pretty immediately adjust to other forms of reading. It\u2019s a habit like all habits.\n\nOne of \u201cMaddaddam\u2019s\u201d characters references brain plasticity as an argument against the death penalty. There are many passages in the book where it\u2019s tempting to view the characters\u2019 debates as analogues to ones we\u2019re having now \u2013\n\nI think they\u2019re just the debates that people would have \u2013 that\u2019s what they would be thinking and talking about.\n\nBut would people debate the death penalty in the same way in every circumstance?\n\nThe death penalty as we have it now depends on prisons. You have to have somewhere to put people before you death-penalty them. This is a society in the future that doesn\u2019t have prisons, doesn\u2019t have the manpower to do prison-guarding, etc., so what are they going to do?\n\nSo even ideas that people tend to think about as absolutes, such as the rightness or wrongness of capital punishment \u2013\n\nThey\u2019re not absolutes. They\u2019re entirely dependent on what kind of resources we have to enable them. So in nomadic societies, you\u2019re not going to have a justice system that incarcerates people for long periods of time and has long trials, are you? And you\u2019re not going to have anything like a life sentence, because where are you going to put these people? If they\u2019re a threat to you and your society, you will kill them, and that\u2019s typically what happened \u2026 One of the sources for how people were treated is the Bible, and the other is the \u201cIliad\u201d and the \u201cOdyssey.\u201d What did you do when you won the Trojan War? You took all of the males, including children, and you threw them off a cliff. You didn\u2019t want them around, wreaking revenge on you. And then you enslaved the females \u2026 So the whole criminal justice system that we have is entirely dependent on buildings.\n\nSometimes genre science fiction takes people as they are today and puts them in a different situation where they manage to make things work out the way they might here; clearly you\u2019ve done something different.\n\nIt entirely depends on what kind of technological situation you\u2019re going to put them into. So what are the tools that they have? Because we are very tool-driven. And it\u2019s very fascinating to me to read the speculation going on amongst paleo-anthropologists. For instance, the over-arm baseball throw \u2013 only human beings can do that because of the structure of their bodies. What\u2019s the over-arm throw good for, supposing you\u2019re in the Pleistocene?\n\nSpears.\n\nRight. So it enables you to kill at a distance, and killing at a distance enables you to kill without being physically wounded yourself. Big plus. Why did we develop drones? Same idea. Allows you to kill at a distance without endangering your own life or getting wounded. So the drones we have today are an extension of the over-arm throw. And everything we do is an extension of stuff we want to do and have always wanted to do. We never make anything [that isn\u2019t] \u2013 with one exception: In Japan, they have a contest devoted to completely useless inventions.\n\nWhen you were writing \u201cOryx & Crake,\u201d did you have the idea that you\u2019d present the back stories of its minor characters in sequels?", "article_metadata": {"description": "The author talks about \"MaddAddam,\" how technology affects our lives, and being dubbed \"Queen of the Nerds\"", "title": "Margaret Atwood on books: \u201cPush comes to shove, they\u2019re great insulating material\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The author talks about \"MaddAddam,\" how technology affects our lives, and being dubbed \"Queen of the Nerds\"", "title": "Margaret Atwood on books: \u201cPush comes to shove, they\u2019re great insulating material\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/09/08/margaret_atwood_on_books_push_comes_to_shove_they%e2%80%99re_great_insulating_material/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/09/margaret_atwood.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The author talks about \"MaddAddam,\" how technology affects our lives, and being dubbed \"Queen of the Nerds\"", "title": "Margaret Atwood on books: \u201cPush comes to shove, they\u2019re great insulating material\u201d", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/09/margaret_atwood.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Mike Doherty", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Books, Editor's Picks, Fiction, maddaddam, Margaret Atwood, science-fiction", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe01b6\"", "article_summary": "It entirely depends on what kind of technological situation you\u2019re going to put them into.\n3: Push comes to shove, they\u2019re great insulating material.\nAnd you\u2019re not going to have anything like a life sentence, because where are you going to put these people?\nA few humans survive, eking out a parlous existence in a rundown world; by the end, they\u2019re repurposing bedsheets as clothes.\nWhen you were writing \u201cOryx & Crake,\u201d did you have the idea that you\u2019d present the back stories of its minor characters in sequels?"}
