Paul Ryan (R-WI), gestures as he speaks during a gala prior to the start of the Virginia GOP Convention in Roanoke, Virginia. (AP Photo/Steve Helber)\n\nThis post originally appeared at TalkPoverty.\n\nTalkPoverty.org believes that if we are to dramatically reduce poverty in the United States we will need a strong and diverse movement that is led by people who know poverty firsthand.\n\nYesterday, Representative Paul Ryan\u2019s unveiling of his new proposal to address poverty offered the opportunity to gather responses from some of the people who might lead such a movement.\n\nHere is what they had to say:\n\nTianna Gaines-Turner: About Work and People Receiving Public Assistance\n\nTom Colicchio: \u2018Opportunity Grants\u2019 Will Make Hunger Worse\n\nLaffon Brelland, Jr.: \u2018My Family Does Not Struggle Because We Lack Work Ethic\u2019\n\nMelissa Boteach: Ryan\u2019s Case Against Himself\n\nPeter Edelman: Compassionate Conservatism Rides Again\n\nAnne Ford: Put Energy into Raising Wages\n\nDeepak Bhargava: Ryan\u2019s Poverty Plan Equals More Attacks on the Poor\n\nDr. Mariana Chilton: Not a Serious Dialogue\n\n\n\nTianna Gaines-Turner: About Work and People Receiving Public Assistance\n\nEarlier this month, I had the honor of testifying at one of the War on Poverty hearings. I testified as a member of Witnesses to Hunger, and as a representative for millions of Americans like me who are struggling with poverty. I had hoped that by sharing my story, and my ideas for change, Congressman Paul Ryan would have released a poverty plan that listened a little more closely to my recommendations.\n\nI do appreciate some of what he said in yesterday\u2019s event at the American Enterprise Institute. I\u2019m glad he recognizes that the government has an obligation to expand opportunities in America. Many of his ideas are good. Increasing the Earned Income Tax Credit would help a lot of struggling Americans \u2014 although paying for it by eliminating the Social Services Block Grant wouldn\u2019t \u2014 and results-driven research is an important part of understanding what works and what doesn\u2019t.\n\nMy husband and I both work part-time jobs, but we still struggle to make ends meet. Millions of Americans face similar situations as my husband and me.\n\nI did not appreciate Mr. Ryan\u2019s comments about work and people on public assistance. He started out by saying that today\u2019s Americans are working harder than ever before, but aren\u2019t getting ahead. This I agree with. My husband and I both work part-time jobs, but we still struggle to make ends meet. Millions of Americans face similar situations as my husband and me.\n\nBut Mr. Ryan went on to explain that he wants to incorporate work into the safety net, like they did with welfare reform in 1996. I do not think this is a good idea. I stressed this during my testimony in front of the House Budget Committee. I explained that families are working. We don\u2019t need to be placed in more work programs, we need our jobs to pay living wages, and to offer family-oriented policies like paid sick and paid family leave. This way, we can earn more, save money and create our own safety net so that we never have to turn to the government for help again.\n\nI am happy that Congressman Ryan ended his speech by encouraging people to send him constructive criticism, and more recommendations for him to consider when developing this poverty plan. He can be sure that I will be writing to him with more of my ideas, and more recommendations from my Witnesses to Hunger brothers and sisters.\n\nTianna Gaines-Turner is a member of Witnesses to Hunger, a program hosted by the Center for Hunger Free Communities at Drexel University featuring the voices and photography of parents and caregivers who have experienced hunger and poverty firsthand. She is a married mother of three children, and works with children at a local recreation facility in Northeast Philadelphia.\n\n\n\nTom Colicchio: \u2018Opportunity Grants\u2019 Will Make Hunger Worse\n\nWhen Congressman Paul Ryan talks about consolidating means-tested programs like food stamps, child care, welfare and housing into a single grant, he\u2019s talking about a block grant. And that\u2019s something we already know all too much about.\n\nThe TANF block grant created in 1996 made cash assistance much harder to obtain. In 1996, about 68 percent of families with children living in poverty were able to get TANF cash assistance. Now about 25 percent can get it. Plus, the block grant is still funded at 1996 levels so cash benefits have decreased dramatically in terms of their real purchasing power.\n\nWe can\u2019t allow the same thing to happen with food assistance.\n\n[Hunger] is unacceptable in the wealthiest nation in the world, and it\u2019s a crisis virtually unknown in other wealthy nations. But hunger is also a problem we can solve \u2014 if we look honestly and critically at the policies that contribute to either making hunger worse, or to reducing it.\n\nWe already have a hunger crisis in this country. Nearly 50 million people don\u2019t necessarily know where there next meal is coming from. It\u2019s unacceptable in the wealthiest nation in the world, and it\u2019s a crisis virtually unknown in other wealthy nations.\n\nBut hunger is also a problem we can solve \u2014 if we look honestly and critically at the policies that contribute to either making hunger worse, or to reducing it.\n\nLumping nutrition assistance in with other much needed assistance \u2014 like housing and child care \u2014 would make hunger worse. For one thing, it makes it much more difficult for our growing Food Movement to hold legislators accountable for their votes on food issues. If they vote to cut the block grant is the money cut from food or housing? And if we leave it to the whims of states to decide how much nutrition assistance people can receive, or whether they can receive it at all \u2014 as with TANF \u2014 then how will we ever resolve as a nation to end hunger?\n\nAs I\u2019ve written previously, it\u2019s time we have a Food Movement that votes on a good fair food system for all. That same movement needs to be vigilant and speak out against bad ideas that will make our food system worse.\n\nThat means speaking out in no uncertain terms against Congressman Ryan\u2019s proposal.\n\nTom Colicchio is a chef and food activist.

I grew up with my mother and two sisters, and although my mother always worked, we struggled to make ends meet. When the economy tanked, my mother lost her job. My older sister was in college, and even with the help from other outside family members and government assistance, we could not cover the cost of her education and all of our family\u2019s other expenses.\n\nI remember the day my mother looked me in the eye and said, \u201cI\u2019m going to be honest with you, son. With the way things are right now, I won\u2019t be able to help you pay for college. What happens to you now is all on you.\u201d\n\nMy family does not struggle because we lack work ethic, which Paul Ryan\u2019s new plan implies is the underlying cause of poverty in America. My family struggles because of poverty wages, which Ryan\u2019s plan does nothing to rectify.\n\nI took her advice and got to work. In addition to being a full-time high school honor student, I worked two low-wage jobs to help my family pay the bills. The years went on and things got harder at home. My family was always working. With my help, we were able to put my sister through college. I will be a sophomore at the University of South Carolina in the fall. But even with every able body in the house working, it is still a challenge every month to cover the bills.\n\nMy family does not struggle because we lack work ethic, which Paul Ryan\u2019s new plan implies is the underlying cause of poverty in America. My family struggles because of poverty wages, which Ryan\u2019s plan does nothing to rectify. Yesterday marked the fifth anniversary of the last time the federal minimum wage was raised. My family and I work tirelessly, but until employers are required to pay us enough to thrive, my families and thousands like ours will continue to scrape by.\n\nLaffon Brelland, Jr. is a rising sophomore at the University of South Carolina, double-majoring in English and Spanish.

Ryan proposed a plan that would eliminate a program that consolidates multiple antipoverty programs into a single grant to states in the name of providing greater flexibility. Yep, you read that right.\n\nWhile the press coverage has focused on Rep. Ryan\u2019s \u201cnew\u201d idea of consolidating multiple programs into a single \u201cOpportunity Grant,\u201d most of the coverage missed the fact that he proposed to pay for part of his plan by eliminating the Social Service Block Grant (SSBG).\n\nWhile the press coverage has focused on Rep. Ryan\u2019s \u201cnew\u201d idea of consolidating multiple programs into a single \u201cOpportunity Grant,\u201d most of the coverage missed the fact that he proposed to pay for part of his plan by eliminating the Social Service Block Grant (SSBG).\n\nThe SSBG is a capped, flexible stream of funding to states that funds services such as adoption, child care, counseling, child abuse prevention, community-based care for seniors and people with disabilities, and employment services. Last year it helped approximately 23 million people, about half of them children. The program dates back to 1981, when a series of social services were consolidated into this single grant, and since then, many nonprofits have been funded by it to provide services like case management. Sounds a lot like Rep. Ryan\u2019s \u201cOpportunity Grant,\u201d right?\n\nUnfortunately, while SSBG provides states with enormous flexibility, over time it lost a lot of political capital. Politicians began to complain that it was duplicative of other programs. Policymakers could cut it time and again without having to cite any specific consequences since the money was \u201cflexible.\u201d Over time, it has lost 77 percent of its value due to inflation, cuts, and funding freezes, and in recent years, there have been attempts to eliminate it altogether. This is surely predictive of Rep. Ryan\u2019s new proposal.\n\nWhich brings me back to the \u201cOpportunity Grants.\u201d Right now, Rep. Ryan is claiming that his plan is completely deficit neutral, and states would not lose any money.\n\nRep. Ryan proposes eliminating the Social Service Block Grant altogether to pay for his proposed EITC expansion for childless workers. In an ironic twist that he seems to miss, he claims that SSBG is \u201cineffective.\u201d\n\nYet, in a cautionary tale, calls for elimination of SSBG have been supported by none other than Rep. Ryan, who out of the other side of his mouth is proposing an eerily similar idea: to consolidate, in the name of flexibility, major funding streams that currently help low-income families. In fact, Rep. Ryan proposes eliminating the Social Service Block Grant altogether to pay for his proposed EITC expansion for childless workers. In an ironic twist that he seems to miss, he claims that SSBG is \u201cineffective.\u201d\n\nThank you, Paul Ryan, for illustrating more clearly than anyone else possibly could why your proposal is so dangerous.\n\nMelissa Boteach is the Vice President of the Poverty to Prosperity Program and Half in Ten Education Fund at the Center for American Progress.

In fact the suit of clothes is made of porcupine quills \u2014 take a close look and it\u2019ll poke you in the eye. He\u2019s now seeming sweet and sympathetic in wanting to do something about poverty, but what he\u2019s proposing is mainly a shell game \u2014 now you see it, now you don\u2019t.\n\nHe\u2019s [Paul Ryan] now seeming sweet and sympathetic in wanting to do something about poverty, but what he\u2019s proposing is mainly a shell game \u2014 now you see it, now you don\u2019t.\n\nNever mind that his budgets for the past four years \u2014 which would have cut $5 trillion dollars over 10 years, with 69 percent of the cuts coming in programs for low- and moderate-income people \u2014 are still on the table. The latest Paul Ryan says he will turn well over $100 billion in federal programs into block grants once his state demonstrations prove successful. And he says he won\u2019t cut any of the programs in his block grant. Will the real Paul Ryan please stand up?\n\nOf course, the new and improved version of his proposals is still pretty lousy. Block grant food stamps? Terrible idea. I guess he thinks it\u2019s fine for Mississippi to say that the definition of hunger there isn\u2019t the same as it is in Minnesota. Make housing compete with child care by putting them both in the same block grant? Why? What we need is more investment in both.\n\nPeter Edelman on fighting poverty\n\nBlock grants are not the friend of low-income people. TANF, among other issues, is receiving the same $16.6 billion appropriation now as it had in 1996. The Social Services Block Grant received $2.5 billion when it was enacted in the early 70s and is now getting $1.7 billion. I guess there\u2019s no reference to inflation in Paul Ryan\u2019s instruction manual.\n\nIt\u2019s time to get real. There are two huge problems (and lots of smaller ones) that are making it difficult to reduce poverty right now. One is the flood of low-work in our country \u2014 which results in 106 million people with incomes below twice the poverty line, below $39,000 for a family of three. What does Paul Ryan propose to do about that? Nothing. The other is the huge hole in our national safety net for the poorest among us \u2014 6 million people whose total income is from food stamps, which by itself is less than about $7,000 annually for a family of three. Paul Ryan has a proposal there \u2014 put TANF, which is already almost nonexistent in most of the country, into a block grant along with food stamps, housing, child care, and God knows what else. How does he think that will go?\n\nWe tried compassionate conservatism. There was no there there then \u2014 and there still isn\u2019t.\n\nPeter Edelman is a Professor of Law at the Georgetown Law Center, and the Faculty Director of the Georgetown Center on Poverty and Inequality.\n\n\n\nAnne Ford: Put Energy into Raising Wages\n\nI\u2019ve been a nurse for more than 30 years. I worked at DC General for 17 years and as a home health nurse for 10 years before a back surgery left me unable to care for adults. So, I switched to working with children. I\u2019ve worked in children\u2019s hospitals and as a school nurse and I loved it. But when I lost my job of five years, I also lost a $2,000 per month paycheck \u2013 resources I needed to care for myself and pay for my mortgage, car loan, insurance and other bills.\n\nWith his new proposal, I can see that Paul Ryan doesn\u2019t care about us. If he did, why would he want to make getting help harder? If he had asked any person in my situation what kind of help they needed, he never would have come up with this plan.\n\nWhen I was finally able to enroll in food stamps and unemployment insurance, I received $700 per month and had to rely on my daughter\u2019s help to make ends meet. Thankfully, I also received Medicaid, which covered my doctor\u2019s appointments, medications and follow-up care from my surgery. Without that care I wouldn\u2019t have been able to leave my house. I really relied on these three benefits to survive until things could get better, same as a lot of people I met in lines, filling out forms alongside me.\n\nWith his new proposal, I can see that Paul Ryan doesn\u2019t care about us. If he did, why would he want to make getting help harder? If he had asked any person in my situation what kind of help they needed, he never would have come up with this plan. He\u2019s never, not for one day, walked in our shoes.\n\nPaul Ryan and I are both Christians, and I encourage him to pray on his new plan. What he\u2019s doing is not godly. Through my church, I volunteer at So Others Might Eat (SOME), an organization that helps people who can\u2019t make ends meet access food, clothing and health care. If Rep. Ryan\u2019s plan goes through, the number of people needing to reach out to organizations like this will only increase, and these organizations can\u2019t meet that kind of increased demand.\n\nIf Paul Ryan really wanted to help he should have proposed creating something, not messing up programs like food stamps that are already working well. He should have proposed to create jobs, or increase the supply of affordable housing.\n\nIf Paul Ryan really wanted to help he should have proposed creating something, not messing up programs like food stamps that are already working well. He should have proposed to create jobs, or increase the supply of affordable housing. He should have put his energy into raising the wages at all these jobs that don\u2019t pay enough to survive. The truth is if you don\u2019t have a job that pays more than the cost of living, you can\u2019t afford the necessities to live. And that\u2019s how we ended up with all these people with nowhere to live who are fighting every minute to put food in their stomachs.\n\nI depend on food stamps, Medicaid and unemployment insurance, but it still isn\u2019t enough to make ends meet. But, for myself, I\u2019m hopeful. Just this Wednesday, I accepted a full-time job as a school nurse without even asking the salary. For all those people out there who are still looking for jobs, what Paul Ryan wants to do makes me scared.\n\nAnne Ford is a school nurse in Washington, DC.\n\n\n\nDeepak Bhargava: Ryan\u2019s Poverty Plan Equals More Attacks on the Poor\n\nFor those of us who wish our nation\u2019s leaders would pay more attention to the 106 million people living on the brink in this country, Paul Ryan\u2019s new plan to address poverty is so bad it might make us think, \u201cCareful what you wish for.\u201d\n\nRep. Ryan\u2019s plan adopts the conventional Republican analysis that individual failure and insufficient effort is the main driver of poverty, and then revives as the solution the bankrupt block grant proposals that have failed in the past.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear \u2014 the premise of Ryan\u2019s argument is wrong. The evidence of our own history and from around the world shows that we can \u2014 through concerted government action \u2014 make a big difference in reducing poverty. The positive effect of better labor market standards and government supports is undeniable, in the US and around the world.\n\nSo what would a serious effort to reduce poverty look like? We could reduce poverty in the US by 80 percent by taking three simple steps:\n\nLet\u2019s be clear \u2014 the premise of Ryan\u2019s argument is wrong. The evidence of our own history and from around the world shows that we can \u2014 through concerted government action \u2014 make a big difference in reducing poverty.\n\nFirst, we need to raise wages so that workers earn a living wage. The minimum wage must be increased to catch up with productivity growth, and workers must have the right to organize and collectively bargain for better wages.\n\nSecond, we need to eliminate racial and gender inequality in the labor market. Poverty isn\u2019t just an economic issue; it\u2019s a women\u2019s rights and racial justice issue. A paycheck should be equal to the amount of work you produce, not be based on the color of your skin or your gender.\n\nFinally, we need full employment. We need to invest in key sectors of the economy\u2014from the green economy to infrastructure \u2014 so that we can create millions of jobs.\n\nThis strategy would reduce poverty in America by 80 percent because it would improve access to what people living in poverty really need: quality jobs that pay a decent wage. Paul Ryan\u2019s plan, in contrast, would give people living in poverty more of what they absolutely don\u2019t need: blame that reinforces the conditions that keep people poor. It would also lead to more hardship by further weakening our already frayed safety net.\n\nDeepak Bhargava is the executive director of the Center for Community Change which you can follow on Twitter @communitychange.\n\n\n\nDr. Mariana Chilton: Not a Serious Dialogue\n\nIt may be surprising to hear this, but Representative Paul Ryan is actually speaking my language.\n\nHe says he is interested in developing opportunity and choice for people, and that people need careers, not just \u201cjobs.\u201d He also said, loud and clear, we need to get rid of the federal red tape. In my state, the need to collect documentation of work participation hours creates such a gnarly cluster of inefficient busy-work and red tape that it sucks the creativity and life out of entire communities.\n\nUntil Rep. Ryan starts including women \u2014 especially women of color, African-American, Latina, American-Indian, Asian and more \u2014 none of us can take this \u201cdialogue\u201d seriously.\n\nWhen Rep. Ryan said \u201ctoo many families in America are working harder and harder yet falling further behind,\u201d I perked up, thinking \u2014 Right! Their wages have deteriorated. We should raise wages to a living wage. But discussion of wages was a glaring omission in his speech.\n\nAnother worrying thing \u2014 his talk of turning programs over to the states. There\u2019s no good precedent for that. Consider Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), which Rep. Ryan consistently holds up as a model for reform: that\u2019s the birthplace of federal and state red tape. Additionally, what we see on the ground with TANF is often punitive, and downright mean. Here\u2019s an example in Pennsylvania: at a County Assistance Office, people waiting to speak to \u201ccareer development workers\u201d are actually forced to sit facing the wall with their backs to the case managers. This is dehumanizing and humiliating.\n\nKristi Jacobson and Mariana Chilton on How Hunger Hurts Everyone\n\nUnfortunately, that dehumanizing treatment of America\u2019s families is what I see when I hear that Rep. Ryan is listening to his \u201cmentors\u201d\u2014 people who say such thoughtless, non-Christian things as \u201cthere is a deserving and undeserving poor.\u201d Last I checked, there is no spiritual tradition, nor any political tradition, that says some people deserve to be hungry (read: poor). Since Paul Ryan comes from a state that has the highest rates of racial disparities in wealth and in health, everything he says should be held up to our public accountability meter that measures for transparency, fairness and basic humanity.\n\nAs I was listening to Rep. Ryan, I almost started thinking I could actually work with him, and that I could join the dialogue. After all, he\u2019s the only leader recently who has shown a public attempt to make fixing poverty a focus of their leadership. But when I saw all the men (read: no women) joining him on the discussion panel at the American Enterprise Institute after his speech, I laughed out loud. Until Rep. Ryan starts including women \u2014 especially women of color, African-American, Latina, American-Indian, Asian and more \u2014 none of us can take this \u201cdialogue\u201d seriously.\n\nDr. Mariana Chilton is a nationally recognized leader addressing child hunger in America.
