It was time for me to come home and help my community.\u201d\n\nEntering politics for the first time, Daugherty knocked off three-term incumbent Tishomingo County Sheriff Glenn Whitlock in the Democratic primary run-off and then bested Republican Mike Higginbottom in the general election.\n\nHe will not be sworn into office until January but will head to the Jackson area in early December to attend a two-week school for new sheriffs. He has not had a chance to meet with the current staff of the Tishomingo County sheriff\u2019s department but he has started mapping out a direction.\n\n\u201cI want to get community-oriented policing back into the daily routine,\u201d said Daugherty. \u201cI would like to see more neighborhood watch groups.\n\n\u201cRight now, there are just two in the county. I want people to feel comfortable contacting a deputy to report a suspicious person.\u201d\n\nHe wants to have an increased public presence. That includes more deputies on county roads and expanding the D.A.R.E. program to all schools.\n\n\u201cI want people to see guys out on patrol,\u201d Daugherty said. \u201cI want people to see us investigating crime, and I want them to see an end result. You can\u2019t win every case, but I want people to see we are working hard and doing everything possible to get an arrest and conviction.\u201d\n\nThe sheriff-elect plans to increase both the amount and the frequency of training the officers receive. Training would include not only officer safety but also policy, forensics and investigation practices.\n\n\u201cAny time an officer has to place his hands on an individual, he needs to be trained,\u201d Daugherty said. \u201cWe train once or twice a year on firearms but don\u2019t do defensive tactics, even though we are handcuffing people every day.\n\n\u201cIf you are not reminded of the proper way to do things, it is easy to get complacent. I want to implement continuing education and training to combat complacency.\u201d\n\nThroughout his 26 years in law enforcement, Daugherty has developed working relationships with many different agencies across the region and the state. He hopes to continue that as sheriff, working closely with surrounding agencies for both investigations and training.\n\nDaugherty also plans on being a hands-on sheriff.\n\n\u201cI will be in uniform and be there for my men, and I will be out in the public,\u201d he said. \u201cOne thing I know is there will not be a chief deputy. Instead, we will have two shift supervisors. If something comes up, the deputies won\u2019t have to look far to find someone in charge and on duty.\u201d\n\nHe plans on interviewing people for all of the jobs at the sheriff\u2019s office, including corrections officers at the county jail. That includes re-interviewing current employees as he tries to put the best people to work for the county.\n\n\u201cI want to build the best department possible for my daughter, for my family and for the people of Tishomingo County,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is my home.\u201d\n\nDaugherty is a local boy but he still used all three names \u2013 John Dennis Daugherty \u2013 in his campaign materials.\n\n\u201cMy uncle was the mayor of Iuka and my aunt owned a dress shop when I was growing up. Back then, everyone knew me as Dennis,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I went to school, I was known by all my classmates as John. Then I had some folks who called me J.D.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey told me I needed to use all three names or folks might not recognize me.\u201d\n\nwilliam.moore@journalinc.com", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal", "description": "By William Moore Daily Journal TUPELO \u2013 As a training officer for the Mississippi Department of Transportation, John Dennis Daugherty has spent the last decade on the road. \u201cI was driving somewhere every day,\u201d Daugherty said. \u201cMost weeks, I would leave home Sunday evening and get back Thursday.
