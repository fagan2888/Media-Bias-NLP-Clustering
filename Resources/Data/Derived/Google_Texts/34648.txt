The former secretary of state hosted a town hall forum at Windham High School and fielded questions from the crowd.

More than 700 people attended the Windham rally as Clinton covered a wide range of issues, including gun safety reform and improving the Affordable Care Act.

She also spoke about the country’s infrastructure, equal pay for women and a plan to make college affordable.

“That will enable middle class working families, poor families to send their kids to a four-year public college or university without having to borrow anything for tuition,” she said.

Clinton defended Planned Parenthood, which has come under fire from Republicans.

“One of the biggest differences that I see with our Republican counterparts is their all-out attack on human rights and women’s rights and civil rights and gay rights and voting rights. It’s quite astonishing,” she said.

“We’re thrilled to be able to announce historic decision to endorse Hillary Rodham Clinton to be the next president of the United States of America,” said Gene Karpinski of the League of Conservation Voters.

Clinton said addressing climate change needs to be a priority.

“I believe we can have 500 million more solar panels installed by the end of my first term and enough renewable electricity to power every home in America within 10 years,” Clinton said.

She started the day at the state capitol, drawing a large crowd as she officially field the paperwork to appear on the New Hampshire primary ballot.

Clinton, Bernie Sanders and Martin O’Malley have all filed for the primary.

Clinton will continue her New Hampshire visit Tuesday with events in Derry and Dartmouth College.
