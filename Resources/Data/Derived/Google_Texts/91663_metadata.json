(PERC) shelter in Union City, which operated at full capacity all summer.\n\nThe number of homeless staying at shelters tends to dip in the warm-weather months, but that was not the case this year, homeless advocates say. Many agree that the majority of their clients are working, but just don\u2019t make enough to be able to afford a place to live.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing an economic squeeze,\u201d said Edwards, who provided 13,000 nights of shelter in 2010 and more than 19,000 last year. \u201cHudson County is getting more expensive. Without the right level of education, people cannot compete in today\u2019s job market, and there\u2019s a lack of entry-level jobs.\n\n\u201cWe were basically at 100 percent,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cIt\u2019s a little overwhelming sometimes.\u201d\n\nRosemary Lavagnino, director of North Hudson Community Action Corp.\u2019s Community Action Program, said about 150 people seek assistance per month, a 40 percent increase from last year.\n\n\u201cThe rents are going up, and people\u2019s incomes are not,\u201d Lavagnino said.\n\nThe NHCAC, based in West New York, provides low-income residents with vital services, such as emergency shelter, transitional housing, and other health and human services.\n\nThe Hoboken Shelter is assisting about 20 percent more people than it did at this time last year, officials there said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m seeing more new people, new faces,\u201d said Executive Director Jaclyn Cherubini. \u201cIt seems that every time we get someone housed, there\u2019s a new person.\u201d\n\nAt St. Lucy\u2019s Emergency Shelter in Jersey City, the 80-bed facility historically has been 85 percent full during the warmer months.\n\n\u201cThat isn\u2019t the case these days,\u201d said Shelter Coordinator Tom Johnson. \u201cWe\u2019re at capacity year-round; when somebody leaves or is discharged, someone is there to fill the space.\u201d\n\nHigh rents in Hudson County and lack of jobs are at the root of the problem, Johnson said. \u201cThe increase has forced us to turn some people away.\u201d\n\nJohnson said there has been talk about increasing capacity in St. Lucy\u2019s.\n\n\u201cOf course, if it were up to me, I wouldn\u2019t turn anybody away,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"article_author": "Marli Horwitz/The Jersey Journal", "medium": "news", "news_keywords": "hudson county", "title": "Homeless population in Hudson County seems to be growing", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Homeless population in Hudson County seems to be growing\", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/jjournal-news/index.ssf/2013/09/homeless_population_in_hudson.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/jersey-journal/photo/2013/07/13094030-large.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"11194121\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-09-07T07:02:41Z\", \"author\": \"Marli Horwitz/The Jersey Journal\", \"tags\": [\"hudson county\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.nj.com/jersey-journal/photo/2013/07/13094030-small.jpg", "description": "The number of homeless in Hudson County appears to be on the rise, officials at local shelters say.", "card": "summary", "site": "@njdotcom"}, "article_date_updated": "Saturday, September 07, 2013,  3:02 AM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.nj.com/jersey-journal/photo/2013/07/13094030-large.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"MHorwitz\", \"author_nickname\": \"Marli Horwitz/The Jersey Journal\", \"author_id\": \"10713863\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Jersey Journal Print Edition\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.nj.com/jjournal-news/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "NJ.com", "description": "The number of homeless in Hudson County appears to be on the rise, officials at local shelters say.", "title": "Homeless population in Hudson County seems to be growing", "url": "http://www.nj.com/jjournal-news/index.ssf/2013/09/homeless_population_in_hudson.html", "image": "http://media.nj.com/design/alpha/img/logo_njo.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NJ.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Saturday, September 07, 2013,  3:01 AM", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "Description": "The number of homeless in Hudson County appears to be on the rise, officials at local shelters say."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf460\"", "article_summary": "The number of homeless in Hudson County appears to be on the rise, officials at local shelters say.\n\u201cHudson County is getting more expensive.\nThe NHCAC, based in West New York, provides low-income residents with vital services, such as emergency shelter, transitional housing, and other health and human services.\nThe number of homeless staying at shelters tends to dip in the warm-weather months, but that was not the case this year, homeless advocates say.\n\u201cWe\u2019re at capacity year-round; when somebody leaves or is discharged, someone is there to fill the space.\u201dHigh rents in Hudson County and lack of jobs are at the root of the problem, Johnson said."}
