American Securities Sells Robertson to Heico, Amid a Flurry of Aerospace Deals

Some recent deals include Nautics acquisition of Aerostar and Warren Buffetts Berkshire Hathaways purchase of Precision Castparts

Airplane parts distributor Heico Corp. (NYSE: HEI) is acquiring Robertson Fuel Systems LLC from American Securities LLC for $255 million in cash.

Robertson, founded in 1977 and based in Tempe, Arizona, produces fuel tanks for military and commercial aircrafts along with other automotive vehicles. American Securities acquired the target in 2006.

“We feel we are well positioned to offer enhanced products and services to our customers and we look forward to the next chapter of growth with Heico,” says Robertson CEO Newman Shufflebarger. American Securities is a New York-based middle-market private equity firm.

Heico has been active in making deals lately. Earlier in 2015, the company purchased F-16 parts maker Aerospace & Commercial Technologies, composites company Astroseal Products Manufacturing Corp., along with receiver producer Midwest Microwave Solutions Inc.

Aircraft parts manufacturers continue to attract buyer interest as airlines upgrade their fleets. For instance, Nautic Partners LLC is buying Aerostar Aerospace Manufacturing LLC ; TransDigm Group Inc. (NYSE: TDG) has agreed to acquire Breeze-Eastern Corp.; and Warren Buffet’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE: BRK.A) bought Precision Castparts.
