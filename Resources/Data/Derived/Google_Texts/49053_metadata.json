It includes a programmable nicotine replacement therapy that delivers targeted doses of nicotine ahead of an individual\u2019s craving, instead of when they\u2019re actually jonesing for a smoke, according to Dr. Levy.\n\nResearch shows that smokers have peak cravings during certain times, usually in the morning when smokers first wake up, around meal times, and then in the evening. The Chrono Therapeutics wearable technology can deliver nicotine at intervals throughout the day to suppress those cravings.\n\nAdditionally, the company offers real-time behavioral support that encourages smokers throughout the day. The device uses Bluetooth technology to link up with the SmartStop digital support program, an application providing real-time guidance to help smokers cope with cravings as well as a means for promoting compliance to the replacement therapy and with the overall (terrible, terrible) process of quitting.\n\nAlthough the company is launching with a device to treat addiction to smoking, Dr. Levy sees applications that range far beyond kicking the nicotine habit. He says that the company\u2019s technology can be used to treat other diseases from addiction to prescription medication to Parkinson\u2019s disease and several other illnesses.\n\nSmoking is a good place to start, according to Levy, because the treatment regime is already well understood, and it will take far less time to go through the approval process with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. It\u2019s also responsible for one in five deaths in the U.S. and costs the U.S. healthcare system \u2014 and by extension the U.S. taxpayer \u2014 billions.\n\nIn fact, the Affordable Care Act has made smoking-cessation treatments reimbursable for the first time, meaning that the market for these treatments can only expand. And already nearly 23 million smokers try to quit each year.\n\nWith Dr. Levy at the helm, the company has a good chance of going the distance, according to Canaan Partners general partner, Wende Hutton. \u201cI first backed Alan [Levy] 20 years ago as the CEO of HeartStream,\u201d says Hutton. \u201cI backed him again in his next startup called Northstar Neuroscience. Anything Alan is involved with is always something I take very seriously.\u201d\n\nBefore the round had closed, Chrono had already received a tremendous vote of confidence in the form of a $2.25 million grant from the National Cancer Institute division of the U.S. National Institute of Health. It was the first time NIH has issued an initial Fast Track Phase I/Phase II grant for a programmable nicotine replacement therapy.\n\n\u201cWe think the platform does have tremendous potential,\u201d says Hutton. \u201cThe addition here which is quite unique is not only an optimized drug delivery vehicle, which we have seen in different formats, but the ability to send that information and turn that into some form of utility\u2026 Those are the pivots \u2014 where we can take a known efficacious drug, deliver it in a more convenient and efficacious way, and optimize that with the ability for patient feedback, behavior modification, and the ability for coaching.\u201d\n\nAnd while other wearable health technologies are trying to avoid regulatory oversight by the Food and Drug Administration, Hutton says there\u2019s value in getting the regulatory seal of approval. \u201cWe\u2019re working with a team that has no fear of the FDA. By navigating those waters, I count having a wearable with the FDA approval label a good thing.\u201d\n\nImage via Ken Hawkins", "article_metadata": {"apple-mobile-web-app-title": "TechCrunch", "sailthru.author": "<a href=\"/author/jonathan-shieber/\" title=\"Posts by Jonathan Shieber\" onclick=\"s_objectID='river_author';\" rel=\"author\">Jonathan Shieber</a> <span class=\"twitter-handle\">(<a href=\"https://twitter.com/jshieber\" rel=\"external\">@jshieber</a>)</span>", "application-name": "TechCrunch", "twitter": {"description": "Smoking-related illnesses kill more than 400,000 Americans each year, including a relative of Guy DiPierro, the founder of Chrono Therapeutics, a startup that raised $32 million to develop a\u2026", "title": "Wearable Maker Chrono Raises $32 Million So Smokers Can Kick The\u2026", "url": "http://techcrunch.com/2014/06/12/wearable-maker-chrono-raises-32-million-so-smokers-can-kick-the-habit/", "image": {"src": "https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/5993085235_78ee123c36_b.jpg?w=764&h=400&crop=1"}, "site": "@techcrunch", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "object_type": "post", "excerpt": "Smoking-related illnesses kill more than 400,000 Americans each year, including a relative of Guy DiPierro, the founder of Chrono Therapeutics, a startup that raised $32 million to develop a wearable drug delivery and treatment technology to help smokers quit.\nThe technology, based on research acquired out of laboratories in Geneva, has been in development for several years and has attracted the\u2026", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "tag": "Chrono Therapeutics", "url": "http://techcrunch.com/2014/06/12/wearable-maker-chrono-raises-32-million-so-smokers-can-kick-the-habit/", "sailthru.tags": "Chrono Therapeutics", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://techcrunch.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/d9ea925a71f82f06a1e6224298f7fe80?s=16", "category": "Wearables", "generator": "WordPress.com", "author": "Jonathan Shieber", "sailthru.date": "2014-06-12 09:13:46", "sailthru.title": "Wearable Maker Chrono Raises $32 Million So Smokers Can Kick The\u00a0Habit", "content": "Smoking-related illnesses kill more than 400,000 Americans each year, including a relative of Guy DiPierro, the founder of Chrono Therapeutics, a startup that\u00a0raised $32 million to develop a wearable drug delivery and treatment technology to help smokers quit.
