So, what if I told you that we already had one?\n\nKim Janda has a vaccine for heroin addiction. And for meth. And for cocaine, too. Janda, an American chemist and the Ely R. Callaway, Jr. Chaired Professor at the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California, gets calls and emails all the time from addicts, and people who know addicts, who want more information about getting involved with clinical trials.\n\nThe problem? There haven\u2019t been any clinical trials. And there won\u2019t be any for the foreseeable future, either.\n\nSays Janda: \u201cNo pharmaceutical company is going to fund trials for heroin, no way \u2026 Forget about it.\u201d\n\nThough he\u2019s worked on vaccines for a variety of addictions, he says the one for heroin shows the most promise. In 2013, he carried out pre-clinical trials on rats who had, ahem, developed an addiction to heroin. After they were given the vaccine, the rats exhibited a dramatic reversal: After receiving the vaccine, these \u201caddiction immune\u201d rats could be injected with 10 times the dose of heroin that a \u201cnormal\u201d rat could handle \u2014 without any ill effects whatsoever.\n\nSo, what does this mean for human beings? Nothing yet, and that\u2019s a big problem.\n\nHow big is our heroin problem?\n\nIn America, our failed drug policies have actually contributed to a dramatic rise in heroin addiction and overdose. Painkiller abuse is frequently cited as a potential \u201cgateway\u201d to heroin use, which makes the 259 million painkiller prescriptions filed each year even more dubious. In 2014, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that 46 Americans die from painkiller overdoses every day.\n\nSo, why would a painkiller abuser \u201cgraduate\u201d to heroin? It\u2019s pretty simple: Heroin is cheaper. And you don\u2019t need a prescription to get it.\n\nExisting solutions\n\nJanda\u2019s vaccines are not the first attempt to curb addiction with pharmaceuticals, but they\u2019re almost certainly the most promising. The FDA has already approved a variety of drugs to treat withdrawal symptoms \u2014 a baby step, to be sure \u2014 but the drugs themselves pose a danger of dependency and withdrawal. You might recognize some of the names, including naltrexone, acamprosate and buprenorphine.\n\nThe short version is that they\u2019re far from perfect.\n\nAdding to Janda\u2019s setbacks were lackluster results from a nicotine vaccine study in 2011 and a cocaine vaccine study in 2014 \u2014 two failures that, unfortunately, seem to have convinced pharmaceutical companies that research of this kind is a dead-end.\n\nThe tricky part of a vaccine like this is the fact that drugs wreak havoc with the brain\u2019s reward systems \u2014 neurological impulses that the human body relies on for survival. Any attempt at a vaccine must seek to curb this effect without interfering with these important natural processes. Existing pharmaceutical solutions address addiction by blocking the relevant receptors in the brain. Janda\u2019s vaccine works instead by preventing the drug from reaching the brain in the first place.\n\nMoney as the Great Equalizer\n\nThe next step for Janda and his team of researchers is to secure investigational new-drug status from the FDA, which would allow them to conduct human trials. They\u2019ve already received funding from the National Institute of Drug Abuse to the tune of $27.1 million \u2014 but that\u2019s not enough to cover the cost of human trials.\n\nAnd that brings us to a pretty embarrassing point: We live in the richest and most powerful country on earth. Janda and his team have stumbled onto something here that could change life in America in untold ways, and still they struggle with pedestrian concerns like money. Think about it: Without addiction, we\u2019d make fewer arrests, our jails would be emptier, our cops would be less distracted with hunting and imprisoning drug addicts, our courts would be greatly unburdened, and we could turn our attention toward treatment instead of the jail-first-and-ask-questions-later approach we have now. In short: We could stop treating addicts like criminals and treat them instead like human beings with a disease.\n\nCan we even put a price tag on that? According to the Affordable Care Act, the answer is no. As far back as December 2014, it was being reported that provisions in the still-new law would require non-grandfathered health plans to provide services recommended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. Although the ACA is still clearly in its infancy, it seems to have laid the groundwork for more widespread coverage of preventive medicine \u2014 including, perhaps, vaccines like Janda\u2019s.\n\nBut I can hear you already: Addiction is a choice\u2014not a disease! Sure; it may start as a choice, as many things do, but neither you, nor I, nor anybody else, has a comprehensive understanding of what happens in the brain between that first \u201ctaste\u201d of heroin and full-blown addiction. And that makes the management of America\u2019s various addictions a job for scientists \u2014 not for cops.\n\nThe good news is that, in the world of pharmaceutical and health technology, sometimes all it takes is for one company, or even one person, to say or do something that captures the attention of the world. In the fight against aggressive robo-calls, for example, all it takes is one frustrated plaintiff. And in the worldwide effort to rid the world of addiction, that one pivotal person may well turn out to be Kim Janda.\n\nAt the end of the day, acknowledging a degree of fluidity in the way we respond to national health crises could help us save an incredible amount of money. George Koob, who has been at Janda\u2019s side throughout these vaccine trials, probably said it best:\n\n\u201cI am not sure Americans realize that, if they treated alcoholism and drug addiction, they would save quadrillions of dollars in health care costs.\u201d\n\nSo, if we can\u2019t answer to our hearts, maybe we can at least answer to our wallets.\n\nImage credit: Kim Janda\n\nDaniel Faris studied journalism at the Writers Institute at Susquehanna University.
