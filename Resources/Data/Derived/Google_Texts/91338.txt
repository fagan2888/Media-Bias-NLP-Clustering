En español | You probably know you're entitled to free credit reports at annualcreditreport.com (you can also get them by calling 877-322-8228 toll-free).

Examining a report from the three major credit bureaus once a year, a different report every four months, can help ensure that your personal and financial information is accurate — and not being used by an identity thief.

What you may not know: There are other free annual reports that can help you spot ID theft. Compiled by lesser-known specialty consumer reporting bureaus, these detail a narrower range of information, such as your history of filing insurance claims, writing checks, paying rent and getting medical treatment. They are primarily used by specific industries — for instance, by banks before approving new checking accounts or by insurers before issuing new policies.
