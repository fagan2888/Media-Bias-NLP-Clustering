Physicians from the practice often visit employers on site, he said, to secure strong relationships, and to make sure the employer can get the most affordable health plan possible for its workers.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve done extensive work with fire companies,\u201d said Huntington. \u201cWe deal with a lot of workers\u2019 compensation patients; not many places will take them.\u201d\n\nWorkFit does not try to compete with primary care. Huntington sees WorkFit as a complementary service to hospitals and primary doctors.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a different perspective of the appropriate levels of care,\u201d said Huntington. \u201cIt\u2019s a way to help decompress the emergency-room setting. It\u2019s a place that isn\u2019t over-packed.\u201d\n\nThe 1971 Western Ave. location used to be inhabited by Concentra, an urgent-care facility, but WorkFit Medical bought Concentra\u2019s physical assets in September. WorkFit, founded by C. Jay Ellie, Jr., M.D. a decade ago, started as an emergency-room staffing agency, and eventually grew into a freestanding occupational health center.\n\nWorkFit is based in Rochester, but Huntington thought that expansion to the Albany market was important.\n\n\u201cThis is our first step outside of the Rochester area,\u201d said Huntington. \u201cI see Albany as a high- demand area, a place for real growth.\u201d\n\nWorkFit accepts all major insurances and some minor ones, and will also work with patients who don\u2019t have any insurance. The price for a visit is comparable to a primary doctor appointment, Huntington said, but significantly lower than an emergency-room visit.\n\nWhat sets WorkFit apart is its extended hours of operation. WorkFit is open on all holidays, 365 days a year, from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. Monday through Friday, and from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. on Saturday and Sunday.\n\nAlso, Huntington believes that the walk-in, no-appointment approach is unique.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s huge,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ll be sitting for hours anywhere else. The waiting time is minimal.\u201d\n\nWorkFit has five physicians and five physician assistants on staff. Elaine Lombardi Wilk, a board-certified emergency-room physician, runs the operation. There\u2019s an X-ray lab on site, and the staff can treat eye problems, broken bones, and other minor injuries.\n\nPhysicals, flu shots, and drug tests are popular at WorkFit, Huntington says. \u201cMostly, it\u2019s coughs, colds, and people being sick after-hours,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you have chest pains, please call 9-1-1, or if you have a major head injury, please go to the hospital.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s also an in-house physical therapist at WorkFit.\n\nHuntington hopes people will see his company first if they\u2019re sick.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a stand-out in occupational medicine,\u201d he said.\n\nEven though WorkFit has been operating since the end of September, a first-quarter grand opening is planned for 2014, Huntington said. He\u2019s not a policy maker, but he expects an increase in business as a result of the new Affordable Care Act; more people will have insurance, he said.\n\n\u201cI think health care will move more towards an outpatient setting,\u201d Huntington said. \u201cMore decisions with money will be allocated, and people will be looking for more appropriate levels of care. We\u2019re looking to be a resource.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; minimum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWe deal with a lot of workers\u2019 compensation patients; not many places will take them.\u201dWorkFit does not try to compete with primary care.\nPhysicals, flu shots, and drug tests are popular at WorkFit, Huntington says.\nElaine Lombardi Wilk, a board-certified emergency-room physician, runs the operation.\n\u201cI think health care will move more towards an outpatient setting,\u201d Huntington said.\nWorkFit Medical, an occupational health service now located in Guilderland, may have the right remedy."}
