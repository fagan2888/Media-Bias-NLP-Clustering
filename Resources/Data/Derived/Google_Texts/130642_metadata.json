The passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010 and the state\u2019s moves toward managed care and other Medicaid reforms made Beth Israel\u2019s model more costly.\n\nBy 2012, Stan Brezenoff, CEO of Continuum, was hunting for a partner that could infuse new capital into Beth Israel.\n\n\u201cAt the time, the trend lines did not look good for Continuum\u2019s hospitals,\u201d Brezenoff told POLITICO on Tuesday. \u201cThe population we served, which included significant [numbers of uninsured], was not the kind that made for optimistic projections. \u2026 It was never thought that we could maintain an 800-bed hospital.\u201d\n\nVolume was decreasing, Brezenoff said. The cardiac program was becoming smaller, the neurosurgery program was shrinking.\n\n\u201cWhat used to be a struggle to balance the budget became Sisyphean,\u201d Brezenoff said.\n\nDavis, of course, would have known all this when he acquired Continuum.\n\nBrezenoff says he wanted to build a new, smaller hospital, but when it became clear he wouldn\u2019t be able to obtain the necessary financing he began looking for a partner.\n\nThe first suitor was NYU Langone Medical Center, which has its main campus about one mile north of Beth Israel.\n\nThe negotiations were handled by Tony Shorris, who at the time was chief of staff at NYU Langone, and is currently first deputy mayor under Bill de Blasio.\n\nShorris had worked as Brezenoff's right-hand man during their time together at the Port Authority, and Brezenoff would later become an adviser to the de Blasio administration.\n\nIn July, 2012, Langone and Continuum agreed to pursue a merger, which would have created one of the largest health systems in the nation.\n\nPress accounts at the time noted that the big loser in such a deal would be Mount Sinai Health, which would have trouble competing with this new behemoth.\n\nOne year later, Mount Sinai officials scuttled the deal with a last-minute offer to Continuum. Their merger, which included acquiring a network of community hospitals such as the two St. Luke\u2019s-Roosevelt campuses, created the largest voluntary health system in New York City, and the largest private employer in the city.\n\nBut the underlying financial problems at Beth Israel could not be solved by new management, and its financial losses continued to grow, eclipsing $90 million in 2014, and on pace for an even greater amount in 2015.\n\nOnly 60 percent of its licensed beds are occupied and patient volume has decreased by double digits since 2012, according to Mount Sinai officials.\n\nDavis has long known he would have to address Beth Israel and, as POLITICO New York first reported, began courting the de Blasio administration in 2015, speaking directly with Shorris about the need to downsize.\n\nDe Blasio, during the Democratic primary, campaigned on keeping hospitals open, was arrested during a demonstration at LICH, and blamed his rival Christine Quinn for allowing the closure of St. Vincent\u2019s (another Manhattan hospital that Davis had also reportedly eyed).\n\nDe Blasio, during his first two years in office often spoke of the many hospitals that closed during the Bloomberg administration, highlighting, during his 2015 budget address, Beth Israel\u2019s Singer division, which closed in 2004.\n\nThough Beth Israel will technically remain open while this new facility is being built, a major, century-old health care institution will effectively be shutting down on his watch, to be sold off to a private interest.\n\nAnother concern for the de Blasio administration is what impact this change will have on Bellevue Hospital, part of the financially struggling New York City Health + Hospitals system.\n\nBellevue, less than one mile from Beth Israel, is already at capacity and if patients currently being served there came to rely instead on Bellevue or Metropolitan Hospital, which is farther north on First Avenue, the city\u2019s public hospital system could inherit the very same payer mix that is causing Mount Sinai to lose money.\n\nThe de Blasio administration did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nDavis, in addition to meeting repeatedly with Shorris, also courted 1199SEIU promising that all union employees affected by the transformation will be offered other union opportunities at equal pay.\n\nUnion leader George Gresham, perhaps sensing the inevitability of Mount Sinai\u2019s plans, lent his support to Davis\u2019 decision, depriving would-be opponents of the downsizing of a potentially powerful ally.\n\nPlans for this expansion must still be approved by the state\u2019s Department of Health.\n\nAuthors:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Politico PRO", "description": "<p>Mount Sinai Health announced Wednesday a $500 million plan to drastically reduce the size of Beth Israel Medical Center, a politically fraught move that signals a long-term redrawing of the health care map in Manhattan.</p>", "title": "Major downsizing at Beth Israel would redraw Manhattan health care map", "url": "http://www.politico.com/states/new-york/city-hall/story/2016/05/major-downsizing-at-beth-israel-would-redraw-manhattan-health-care-map-102151", "image": "http://static.politico.com/capny/sites/default/files/a-1024px-Beth_Israel_Medical_Center_-_New_York_City%20(1)_0.png", "type": "article"}, "description": "<p>Mount Sinai Health announced Wednesday a $500 million plan to drastically reduce the size of Beth Israel Medical Center, a politically fraught move that signals a long-term redrawing of the health care map in Manhattan.</p>", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "| Momos Major downsizing at Beth Israel would redraw Manhattan health care mapMount Sinai Health announced Wednesday a $500 million plan to drastically reduce the size of Beth Israel Medical Center, a politically fraught move that signals a long-term redrawing of the health care map in Manhattan.\nBy 2012, Stan Brezenoff, CEO of Continuum, was hunting for a partner that could infuse new capital into Beth Israel.\nThe first suitor was NYU Langone Medical Center, which has its main campus about one mile north of Beth Israel.\nIt has been clear for some time that something would have to change at Beth Israel, too.\nBeth Israel Medical Center."}
