The maximum penalty for computer abuse crimes under the federal anti-hacking law \u2014 known as the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, or CFAA \u2014 is 10 years for first offenders and 20 years for repeat offenders.\n\nOne of the factors the guidelines tell judges to take into account is the so-called \u201closs,\u201d or the financial harm caused by a cyber crime. But the guidelines define \u201closs\u201d far more broadly for CFAA convictions than they do for other crimes.\n\nLoss can include any reasonable cost to the victim \u2014 including the cost of restoring a system or conducting a damage assessment \u2014 whether or not that loss was foreseeable.\n\nCritics say that standard provides too much latitude to prosecutors and can lead to excessive sentences compared to other kinds of fraud.\n\nSuch broad definitions \u201cgive prosecutors wide discretion to ratchet potential sentences for defendants who insist on exercising their constitutional right to go to trial,\u201d says the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), which supports an overhaul of CFAA.\n\nBut with the limited number of cybercrime convictions compared to other crimes, judges have little to go on aside from the Sentencing Guidelines.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like your standard drug crime where there\u2019s very little new under the sun and a judge can compare his or her own prior sentences that have similar facts,\u201d Glen Kopp, a former assistant U.S. attorney and partner in Bracewell & Guiliani\u2019s white collar practice. \u201cHere, you can get judges that are sentencing people for the first time in this context.\u201d\n\nAn increased focus on investigating and prosecuting cybercrimes has placed added pressure on the legal system to assess responsibility appropriately and mete out punishments that act as a deterrent.\n\nThe Department of Justice last fall embedded a prosecutor within the European criminal justice agency Eurojust to better combat hackers, who often strike the U.S. from across the Atlantic.\n\nThe FBI, meanwhile, has placed three new permanent Cyber Assistant Legal Attach\u00e9s in foreign offices, with plans to add four more in 2016.\n\nThe result has been a number of high-profile extraditions and convictions for hacking.\n\nOn Tuesday, a Manhattan district judge sentenced a Latvian man to time already served for his part in the infamous Gozi virus, a case that observers say highlights some of the challenges judges face in administering the appropriate punishments.\n\nThe Gozi virus infected at least 40,000 U.S. computers and has been called \"one of the most financially destructive computer viruses in history\u201d \u2014 but Deniss Calovskis wrote only one section of the code, and was compensated a mere $1,000 for his role in the scheme.\n\nAfter pleading guilty to conspiracy to commit computer intrusion in a federal court in September, he was sentenced to the 21 months in prison he has already served and will be allowed to return to Latvia in a matter of weeks.\n\nCalovskis\u2019 defense attorney urged the judge to consider that he neither participated in collecting data from infected computers nor used the data to illegally access financial institutions.\n\n\u201cWhen you have 500 kilos of cocaine, you have 500 kilos of cocaine. You can\u2019t make it 50,\u201d Kopp said. \u201cIn the cyber context, people have trouble grasping it as a tangible thing. I think there will be some room for some creative negotiating by defense attorneys and prosecutors as to the scope of responsibility for an individual who may have written part of a code.\u201d\n\nCritics say it\u2019s not just the Sentencing Guidelines for CFAA that need reform \u2014 they say the law itself is both draconian and stymies legitimate security research.\n\nThe suicide of the computer programmer and digital activist Aaron Schwartz, who faced up to 35 years in prison and $1 million in fines under CFAA, sparked an eponymous bill that would change the statute\u2019s definition of \u201caccess without authorization.\u201d\n\nSwartz was accused of illegally accessing the network at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in order to download millions of academic journal articles and them share them online.\n\nObservers say sentencing for cybercrimes will continue to be a moving target.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still a young trend. I hate to make any overarching generalizations because cybercrime overall is still in its infancy,\u201d Marcum said. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be in transition as technology changes and as the offender changes.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "They have little guidance for determining appropriate sentences.", "description": "They have little guidance for determining appropriate sentences.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Katie Bo Williams", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "They have little guidance for determining appropriate sentences.", "title": "Judges struggle with cyber crime punishment", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/265285-judges-struggle-with-cyber-crime-punishment", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/cybersecurity_043014thinkstock.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T05:25-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/265285-judges-struggle-with-cyber-crime-punishment", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2016-01-09T09:54-05:00", "dcterms.creator": "Dustin Weaver", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-09T09:54:29-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00"}, "keywords": "Cybercrime, Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, Harassment,,", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/265285-judges-struggle-with-cyber-crime-punishment", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "They have little guidance for determining appropriate sentences.", "card": "summary", "title": "Judges struggle with cyber crime punishment"}, "dcterms.title": "Judges struggle with cyber crime punishment"}, "article_summary": "Cyber crime is such a recent phenomenon that there are few guideposts for judges to use, experts say.\nOne of the factors the guidelines tell judges to take into account is the so-called \u201closs,\u201d or the financial harm caused by a cyber crime.\nBut with the limited number of cybercrime convictions compared to other crimes, judges have little to go on aside from the Sentencing Guidelines.\nObservers say sentencing for cybercrimes will continue to be a moving target.\nADVERTISEMENT\u201cCybercrimes on the grand scheme are so new, they\u2019re kind of playing it by each individual case,\u201d said Dr. Catherine Marcum, a criminal justice professor who has studied cybercrime sentencing."}
