Coming from a predominantly Navajo (Din\u00e9) community and growing up on the Navajo Nation, I am used to being surrounded by individuals who look like me and understand where I am coming from. Oftentimes, I forget how much my ancestors have willingly sacrifice for my survival, my resistance, and my existence. I forget how very narrow the choices they had in life, and the choices they made were not for themselves. The choices they made were for me, and the generations after me.\n\nMichelle Reid, Antartica \u2013 Rock Your Mocs 2015 Facebook Event Page\n\nErin O\u2019Keefe at #RunFlagstaff\n\n\u201cI rocked my mocs at work today #RunFlagstaff!\u201d said Erin O\u2019Keefe on the Rock Your Mocs 2015 Facebook Event Page. \u201cHonoring my ancestors who ran in their moccasins! As Indigenous peoples, we have running in our blood. It's a form of prayer and moving meditation. So, no matter how fast or slow - just #RUN ! Keep the mind, body, and spirit strong for those who lived before us and those who will exist after us.\"\n\nRock Your Mocs is now a much-loved Native American Heritage Month tradition throughout Turtle Island.
