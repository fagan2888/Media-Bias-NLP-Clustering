Saturday it was Democrats Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who drew the biggest crowd so far since starting his campaign.\n\n\"We can do it when we stand up and say, 'Enough is enough! The billionaires aren't going to have it all,'\" Sanders said at the rally.\n\nMore than 11,000 people showed up, but Marson said many of them were in town for the Netroots Nation Conference.\n\n\"A lot of those people are from out of state,\" Marson said. \"Those aren't just Arizonans. If you were to do that next week, that would not have been nearly as well attended.\"\n\nTrump is still getting attention for the controversial comments he made during his rally before 4,200 people at the Phoenix Convention Center.\n\n\"Mexico is taking, I respect the country, they are taking our jobs; they're taking our manufacturing; they're taking our money; they're taking everything, and they\u2019re killing us on the border,\u201d he said at the rally.\n\n\"He got a good showing here in Arizona, and I\u2019m sure he's going to want to build on that,\" Marson said.\n\nThere were also plenty of protesters at his speech.\n\n\"There's no doubt that Donald Trump is putting Arizona on the map as far as presidential politics, and people really need to start coming here and addressing the issues that we really care about whether it's the economy, Obamacare, immigration,\" Marson said.\n\nCopyright 2015 KPHO/KTVK (KPHO Broadcasting Corporation).
