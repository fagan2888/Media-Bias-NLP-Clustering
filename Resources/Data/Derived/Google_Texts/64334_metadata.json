Majorities of respondents maintained that belief even in the cases of religiously affiliated institutions, like colleges and hospitals. Churches are the only type of employers that most Americans agree shouldn\u2019t have to offer copay-free birth control.\n\n\u201cAmericans make a clear distinction between churches, which most believe should be exempt, and other types of organizations,\u201d Dr. Robert P. Jones, the CEO of PRRI, noted in a statement.\n\nPRRI\u2019s polling comes as the Supreme Court is poised to hand down a decision regarding this exactly this question about Obamacare\u2019s birth control coverage. In one of the most closely watched cases of the year, two for-profit companies argued they should be exempt from this particular federal law because covering birth control violates their religious beliefs.\n\nIf Hobby Lobby and Conestoga Wood Specialties win their case, they\u2019ll be allowed to invoke religious liberty even though they\u2019re not religiously affiliated companies \u2014 something that could open the door to allow other business owners to cite their faith to justify discrimination against LGBT Americans. That potential future is deeply unpopular with the general public, according to PRRI\u2019s new polling. Just 16 percent of participants said that businesses should be able to deny services from gay and lesbian individuals on religious grounds.\n\nThis is hardly the first polling that has confirmed the popularity of Obamacare\u2019s birth control coverage. A recent survey published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found an even stronger majority in support of the policy, as about seven in ten respondents said that companies should cover the full cost of contraception in their insurance plans. Another poll found that two thirds of female voters hope that Hobby Lobby and Conestoga Wood lose their Supreme Court case. PRRI has consistently found that most religious Americans are supportive of expanding birth control coverage, too.\n\nAbout 14,000 workers are employed at the two companies that are currently seeking to eliminate coverage for birth control prescriptions and counseling. In addition to the two plaintiffs, more than 70 other companies also sued over this Obamacare provision, and likely wouldn\u2019t hesitate to remove contraceptive coverage if the ruling goes their way.\n\nThose bosses are contemplating what could work out to be a very poor business decision for their companies. Including coverage for contraception in workers\u2019 health plans actually tends to save money in the long run, thanks to the high medical costs of pregnancy and childbirth. Research has also shown that ensuring women have access to the pill helps them invest in their careers and remain in the workforce.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "As the Supreme Court prepares to hand down a ruling about a challenge to Obamacare's birth control coverage, public opinion is clear.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "As the Supreme Court prepares to hand down a ruling about a challenge to Obamacare's birth control coverage, public opinion is clear.", "title": "Most Americans Want Employers Like Hobby Lobby To Offer Birth Control Coverage", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/06/03/3444079/americans-birth-control-coverage/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Hobby-Lobby-SCOTUS-protest-e1401636304336.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "As the Supreme Court prepares to hand down a ruling about a challenge to Obamacare's birth control coverage, public opinion is clear.", "title": "Most Americans Want Employers Like Hobby Lobby To Offer Birth Control Coverage", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Hobby-Lobby-SCOTUS-protest-e1401636304336-321x214.jpg", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Hobby-Lobby-SCOTUS-protest-e1401636304336.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Hobby-Lobby-SCOTUS-protest-e1401636304336.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-03T08:50:59+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcea8d\"", "article_summary": "Churches are the only type of employers that most Americans agree shouldn\u2019t have to offer copay-free birth control.\nPRRI has consistently found that most religious Americans are supportive of expanding birth control coverage, too.\nThis is hardly the first polling that has confirmed the popularity of Obamacare\u2019s birth control coverage.\nPRRI\u2019s polling comes as the Supreme Court is poised to hand down a decision regarding this exactly this question about Obamacare\u2019s birth control coverage.\nAccording to PRRI\u2019s findings, about six in ten Americans believe that both publicly held and privately owned corporations should be required to follow Obamacare\u2019s birth control provision."}
