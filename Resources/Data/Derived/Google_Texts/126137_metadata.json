Speed was a factor in the wreck, and troopers said the road was wet.\n\nThe names of those injured have not been released, but authorities said all of the injuries were non-life-threatening. The five teenagers are all students at Leesville Road High School.\n\nThree girls, ages 14 and 15, were thrown from the vehicle in the wreck and landed in a yard across the street. Troopers said none of the girls were wearing seat belts.\n\n\"Two boys were in the front seat. They got out. They were alert but a little confused, and they were saying, 'Where are the girls? Where are the girls?'\" said witness Lisa Sroka. \"There were three girls in the backseat who got ejected out of the back window at some point across the street.\"\n\nThe 16-year-old driver and 17-year-old front-seat passenger were both wearing seat belts. The driver was ticketed for speeding and transporting a passenger under age 16 that wasn't wearing a seat belt.\n\nFour people inside the Toyota SUV were also taken to local hospitals. Their injuries were also non-life-threatening.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30;polling-uri=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=1;polling-uri2=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=2;polling-uri3=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=3;polling-uri4=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=4;polling-uri5=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=5;cycle=1", "dcterms.created": "2013-12-05 22:13:00", "description": "Nine people, including several teenagers, were injured in a two-car crash on Norwood Road in north Raleigh Thursday evening, according to state Highway Patrol troopers.", "application-name": "WRAL.com", "dcterms.modified": "2013-12-06 15:43:44", "outbrain": {"ob_desc": "id_asset=13187459|asset_type=story"}, "twitter": {"description": "Nine people, including several teenagers, were injured in a two-car crash on Norwood Road in north Raleigh Thursday evening, according to state Highway Patrol troopers.", "title": "Nine people injured in two-car crash in Raleigh :: WRAL.com", "url": "http://www.wral.com/nine-people-injured-in-two-car-crash-in-raleigh/13187459/", "image": "http://wwwcache.wral.com/asset/news/local/2013/12/06/13187680/13187680-1386372410-160x120.jpg", "site": "@wral", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#041E30", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "robots": "index,follow", "pinterest": "nohover", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/favicons/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/favicons/mstile-310x150.png", "fb": {"app_id": 334167666672300}, "author": "WRAL", "article": {"published_time": "2013-12-05T22:13:00-05:00"}, "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/favicons/mstile-150x150.png", "og": {"site_name": "WRAL.com", "description": "Nine people, including several teenagers, were injured in a two-car crash on Norwood Road in north Raleigh Thursday evening, according to state Highway Patrol troopers.", "title": "Nine people injured in two-car crash in Raleigh :: WRAL.com", "url": "http://www.wral.com/nine-people-injured-in-two-car-crash-in-raleigh/13187459/", "image": "http://wwwcache.wral.com/asset/news/local/2013/12/06/13187680/1386372399-48778-leyla1-960x540.jpg", "type": "article"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msapplication-TileImage": "/favicons/mstile-144x144.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1e65\"", "article_summary": "Four people inside the Toyota SUV were also taken to local hospitals.\nAccording to investigators, an Acura filled with five teenagers crossed the center line and crashed head on into a Toyota SUV carrying four people shortly after 8:30 p.m.\nThe 16-year-old driver and 17-year-old front-seat passenger were both wearing seat belts.\nTroopers said none of the girls were wearing seat belts.\nThe names of those injured have not been released, but authorities said all of the injuries were non-life-threatening."}
