His father flees Cuba at age 18 for America and washes dishes for 50 cents an hour as a Cuban immigrant. His mother came from a working-class, Irish Catholic family where her mother was the second youngest of 17 children. She became the first in her family to attend college.\n\nFrom this unlikely yet typically American union their son was born. Liberal Harvard professor Alan Dershowitz calls him, \u201cWithout a doubt ... among the smartest students I\u2019ve ever had ....\u201d He worked two jobs, graduated from Harvard Law School, and repaid $100,000 in student loans. He argued 43 cases before the U.S. Supreme Court. His wife, raised by African missionaries in Kenya and Nigeria, returns to America, starts a small business baking bread, and later becomes a Goldman Sachs managing director.\n\nHe asks Americans what life would be like without Barack Obama\u2019s polcies. \u201cImagine,\u201d he says, \u201c... instead of economic stagnation, booming economic growth ... Imagine young people coming out of school with four, five, six job offers... Imagine ... a president ... repealing every word of Obamacare ... Imagine abolishing the IRS ... Imagine a president that finally, finally secures the borders ... Imagine repealing every word of Common Core ... Imagine embracing school choice ... Imagine a president who stands unapologetically with ... Israel ... Imagine a president saying \u2018We will stand up and defeat radical Islamic terrorism.\u2019\u201d Imagine.\n\nHe says what separates America from the world, is \u201c... our rights don\u2019t come from man, they come from God Almighty.\u201d The Declaration of Independence states \u201call Men ... are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights ...\u201d America was founded on Godly principles. John Adams, our second president, said, \u201cThe general principles on which the fathers achieved independence were the general principles of Christianity.\u201d Yet our government and judiciary have done everything to extinguish God. God has not left America; America has left God.\n\nAnd, just six years into Obama\u2019s \u201ctransformation of America\u201d chaos reigns, here and abroad, with the greatest levels of worldwide Christian genocide and terrorism in 1,000 years. America is now mostly governed by un-Godly principles. Yet the man running for president, Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, proclaims, \u201cGod\u2019s blessing has been on America from the very beginning of this nation, and I believe God isn\u2019t done with America yet.\u201d Let\u2019s hope Ted Cruz is right. Let\u2019s hope America chooses Ted Cruz.\n\nBill Skuba,\n\nDrums", "article_metadata": {"author": "Bill Skuba", "title": "Imagine a president with God-given talent", "robots": "ACAP allow-index", "DC.creator": "Bill Skuba", "tout": {"article": {"id": "1.1865070"}}, "keywords": "Mailbag", "DC.subject": "Mailbag", "DC.title": "Imagine a president with God-given talent"}, "article_summary": "Imagine a president saying \u2018We will stand up and defeat radical Islamic terrorism.\u2019\u201d Imagine.\nGod has not left America; America has left God.\nImagine ... a president ... repealing every word of Obamacare ...\nImagine a president that finally, finally secures the borders ...\nImagine a president who stands unapologetically with ...
