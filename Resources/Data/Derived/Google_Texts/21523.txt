Broadband for America released a statement prior to President Obama’s planned Iowa speech regarding “accessible” and “affordable” internet for all. One key component of his speech is the ‘need’ to reclassify broadband to a Title II public utility. More on that later.

President Obama is risking the success we have witnessed by advocating for the reclassification of broadband as a Title II public utility – unprecedented government interference that would stifle private investment, hinder innovation and undermine the growth of the Internet.

The theme of his speech is reminiscent of those given prior to the Affordable Care Act (ACA/”Obamacare”) being passed. Before then, there was much talk about the failings of universal healthcare in Europe. When it comes to the internet proposal, the comparisons to failed, European models continue.

President Obama’s call for Title II reclassification would mirror Europe’s failed over-regulated, utility-style model that has resulted in a slower Internet, less investment, higher prices and less innovation.

Title II reclasification is part of the “net neutrality” package. Although some considered that proposal to be dead, much like “amnesty,” the President has found a way to resurrect it.

The declared motive behind net neutrality is claimed to be the same as the declared motive in the President’s speech: internet accessibility and affordability for all. And like Obamacare, the “affordability” claim is in question.

According to a Progressive Policy Institute study, Iowans would be hit especially hard by new taxes and fees, paying up to $49.59 annually in new wire line fees and up to $52.98 in new mobile broadband fees.

In his statement, Obama mentions “executive action.” This means, like amnesty, he may intend to bypass the legislative branch – Congress – and make “net neutrality” law via an executive order or memo.
