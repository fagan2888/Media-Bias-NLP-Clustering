The founder and current board member, Vietnam veteran and Longmont resident Ray Meyers \u2014 having been in and out of jail \u2014 was working with incarcerated veterans to get them help in jail and assist them in finding community support post-release.\n\nNow, eight years later, the Longmont center has grown into one of the few free resources in Colorado for veterans who need help and a place where veterans can volunteer to help heal other veterans.\n\nThe center, which looks like an idyllic suburban home in the 600 block of Terry Street, cheery yellow paint and white picket fence included, now offers massage therapy, group therapy with a psychotherapist, a transportation program to take veterans to their VA medical appointments, a writing workshop and more. All free and open to any veteran, the center's services increased 22 percent in 2014 and 34 percent the previous year. More than 50 percent of the clients are from wars that pre-date the Iraq War, and 80 percent of clients also volunteer, working with other veterans.\n\n\"They are a minority group and they have unique needs and challenges,\" said Trisha Dittrick, executive director of Veterans Helping Veterans Now. \"All the services we provide here are niche services they can't get elsewhere. Every single program has been at a veteran's request because they want and have looked for that service and haven't been able to find it elsewhere.\"\n\nA major part of the program is not just healing veterans but building connections between veterans and civilians, to create a more cohesive community, instead of one where veterans feel isolated.\n\nIsolation is a major issue facing veterans.\n\nVeterans Helping Veterans Now programs manager and Marine veteran Dan Janosko, left, meets with Navy veteran Coren Benson, 20, on Monday.

This, in turn, helps him, as a veteran, feel more connected.\n\n\"I've gained a lot of insight into my personal things,\" he said. \"But I wasn't aware I was doing that (isolating myself and drinking a lot) until (another veteran) talked about it. I had a lot of personal revelations.\"\n\nDittrick said that kind of insight is central to VHVNow's purpose.\n\n\"We're completely unique,\" Dittrick said. \"It's a really simple model, it's veterans helping veterans. The thought is people get better through volunteerism. People get better by helping other people. It gives them a sense of purpose and meaning.\"\n\nRuprecht has found new purpose through being a part of the organization. His veteran status and extra knowledge helped him defuse a potentially dangerous situation with a veteran who now is incarcerated.\n\nThe officer was called to the veteran's house after a pizza delivery driver said the man refused to pay for a pizza. Ruprecht was able to read and respond to the man's behavior in a way that diffused the situation safely.\n\nVeterans Helping Veterans Now programs manager, and Marine veteran, Dan Janosko, left, meets with Navy veteran Coren Benson, 20. (Lewis Geyer / Staff Photographer)\n\n\"I got a real, crawling-skin feeling (about him),\" Ruprecht said. \"He goes to put on his boots (to come outside), and I think, 'He's getting ready for battle. He wants to fight me.' As he started coming out, I saw his tattoos and was like, 'Oh, you're a Marine!' That chilled it off.\"\n\nRuprecht connected with the veteran, who would not leave his house or speak with non-military persons, for months after that, trying to find a way for him to seek help at VHVNow. The man was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder before he was able to seek help.\n\nVHVNow and public safety\n\nThat kind of knowledge, dedication and the connection veterans can build with civilians through the help of VHVNow is huge for a community, even just in terms of public safety.\n\n\"It's definitely made it safer,\" Ruprecht said. \"From a public safety standpoint with the vets that we have helped and stopped from something happening. All these vets are community members. It's not cops against them; we need to help them so they don't hurt other people. I care about vets. They are our community.\"\n\nFor the past six years, VHVNow has been hosting a community awareness series to better connect veterans with their community. At first the series offered only a veteran speaker, but recently the organization switched the format to bring together groups of veterans and civilians.\n\n\"Volunteer veterans pepper the groups,\" Dittrick said. \"It brings people into relationships with each other. That's the most healing aspect.\"\n\nWhile the veterans will keep helping each other with VHVNow, the organization knows that getting civilians involved, and making Longmont a community of veterans and civilians will have the largest impact, and create better healing.\n\nCody Nichols, a veteran from Iraq, said it best.\n\n\"As a veteran in a military, you do everything by the book,\" he said. \"Here they do everything by the heart.\"\n\nIsa Jones: 303-684-5274, jonesi@timescall.com or twitter.com/theisajones", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.timescall.com/lifestyles/ci_27977424/longmont-group-veterans-helping-veterans-now-meets-needs", "modificationDate": "2015-04-24T22:33:50-0600", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/0423/20150423__26TCCVETw~2_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By Isa Jones \n  Staff Writer", "description": "In 2012, Longmont Police Officer Greg Ruprecht was part of a team called to the house of a military veteran after the man's wife called 911, citing a domestic disturbance and shots fired.
