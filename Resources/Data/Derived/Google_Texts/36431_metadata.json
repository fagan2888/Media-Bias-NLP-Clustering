But there\u2019s an added hassle this year for nearly a million consumers who got financial help with health insurance premiums under President Barack Obama\u2019s law.\n\nThe government sent consumers erroneous information on forms that they need to complete their 2014 tax returns. Now they\u2019re getting robocalls and emails advising them to delay filing until the mistakes get fixed.\n\nSome are taking it in stride. Others wonder what else could go wrong.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a comedy of errors from the start,\u201d said K.C. Crafts, a freelance financial writer from South Berwick, Maine.\n\nThe mistake the government made affected 800,000 customers receiving subsidized health coverage through the federal insurance market. Some states running their own insurance exchanges also have had tax-form troubles.\n\nIn the federal case, 2015 premiums were substituted for what should have been 2014 numbers on new tax forms called 1095-As. Those forms are like W-2s for people who got subsidized health insurance \u2013 building blocks for filing an accurate tax return.\n\nCrafts said her form has another error as well, potentially more serious. The coverage dates are wrong, and the result makes it appear as if she and her husband got much more in subsidies than they actually received. Maine is one of the 37 states served by HealthCare.gov, which is run by the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\n\u201cThis is not just an aggravation, it\u2019s a financial issue, because I could end up paying for a clerical error,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Obama administration says it\u2019s trying to figure out what caused the broader mistake, even as it rushes corrected information to affected taxpayers.\n\nAsked for an explanation at a recent House hearing, HealthCare.gov CEO Kevin Counihan put it this way: \u201cIt appears there was an unfavorable interaction between two pieces of software code.\u201d Translation: The administration is still technologically challenged by health insurance programs.\n\n\u201cThis is an unforced error,\u201d scolded Rep. Matt Cartwright, D-Pa. \u201cIt provides fodder for those who want to tear down\u201d the law.\n\nDonna Brown of Austin, Texas, said she thinks it\u2019s about on par for the government.\n\n\u201cI never am too surprised when the federal government makes mistakes like this,\u201d said Brown, a former executive administrative assistant for a tech company. Taking a break from the industry\u2019s pressures, she said she\u2019s relieved that she was able to get health insurance as a result of Obama\u2019s law. Brown usually files her taxes at the last minute, so the error notices haven\u2019t affected her routine.\n\n\u201cWhoever implemented this, there would have been problems,\u201d said Brown. \u201cIt\u2019s new. Even though it\u2019s the second year of coverage, it\u2019s the first time these statements are coming out.\u201d\n\nThe health care law offers subsidized private insurance to people who do not have access to coverage on the job. Because those subsidies are delivered as tax credits, recipients have to account for them each year on their tax returns. That\u2019s what the 1095-A tax form is supposed to help them do.\n\nFor John Stephens of Littleton, Colorado, it\u2019s turned to vexation. An audio recording and editing specialist, Stephens said his 1095-A indicates he was only insured for the last two months of 2014, when in fact he had coverage since February. Such a mistake could expose him to tax penalties that the law levies on people who remain uninsured if they can otherwise afford coverage.\n\nStephens said he\u2019s spent a lot of time on the phone with his insurer and the Colorado health insurance exchange, which is run by that state. \u201cIt\u2019s really easy for them to bounce the ball back to the other.\u201d Last year, insurers said many of the enrollment records they got from the then-new insurance markets had errors.\n\nSpokesman Curtis Hubbard said the Colorado exchange is reviewing its records and working with Stephens\u2019 insurer to resolve the situation.\n\nStephens said he suspects his situation is an early indicator of more problems. \u201cIt\u2019s the pointy end of the spear,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a big, big problem.\u201d\n\nHubbard said Colorado sent out about 107,000 of the forms to consumers. So far, the exchange has gotten about 170 calls with questions.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The government sent nearly one million consumers erroneous information on forms that they need to complete their 2014 tax returns.
