Our four-year high school graduation rates are terrible, as is our child poverty rate. And, according to statistics compiled by a group called Mental Health America, our collective mental health is simply terrible.\n\nA bit about Mental Health America and its \u201cThe State of Mental Health in America Report 2016\u201d: The organization has been around for more than a century, first as the National Committee for Mental Hygiene, then as the National Mental Health Association and, since late 2006, Mental Health America. It has been criticized for accepting too much money from Big Pharma, and that is a problem.\n\nThis report, however, does not rely on statistics gathered by MHA. Rather, its two chief sources of information are the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Both are found in the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nThe 2016 report has some limitations. SAMHSA\u2019s figures do not include information from the homeless and unsheltered, active duty military personnel and those who are institutionalized. Too, some numbers were gathered before the Affordable Care Act went into effect and more than half the states, including Oregon, expanded their Medicaid programs for the poor.\n\nAll that said, the report seems to be a pretty good tool for a layperson who wishes to understand more about mental health in Oregon.\n\nThe worst news first: Of the 50 states and the District of Columbia, the report ranks Oregon dead last based on prevalences of mental illness and access to care.\n\nAmong the problems here, which may or may not be tied to mental illness but certainly don\u2019t improve the situation, are these: Oregon also reports higher rates of homelessness and child maltreatment, while the graduation rates for the disabled and other students are below par. All but the homelessness rates come from information supplied by federal agencies.\n\nFor adults with mental illness in Oregon, that means we\u2019re the leading state for suicide, we have a relatively high rate of drug and alcohol abuse or dependency and a high rate of suicidal thinking. For youth between the ages of 12 and 17, it means high rates of major depressive episodes and, as with adults, high rates of drug and alcohol abuse or dependence.\n\nThere are some quirks in the figures, to be sure.\n\nFor one thing, Oregon ranks pretty well (13th) on the accessibility of treatment for adults with mental illness, according to data from 2012-13. While 52.4 percent of adult Oregonians with a mental illness did not receive treatment, that ranks above the national average of 57.2 percent. Too, in the pre-Affordable Care Act days, Oregon\u2019s rate of those who did not seek care because it was too expensive was high, and that has surely changed.\n\nThere is some good news, too. In figures from last year, Oregon ranked eighth in the number of citizens per mental health care provider, at 299:1. That\u2019s well below the national average of 566:1\n\nSo what does all this mean in Central Oregon?\n\nIt depends upon who you ask. I\u2019ve spent much of the summer asking that question and others from people actively involved in the region\u2019s mental health system, as providers and families of patients.\n\nAmong the things I discovered, there\u2019s plenty of change in the air where mental health is concerned, and if all goes as planned, things will improve. Too \u2014 and this is true about many such things, I think \u2014 for families involved in the system, knowledge is power. That\u2019s great for those with the knowledge, but not so good for those without it.\n\nI\u2019ll let you know what I\u2019ve found more specifically in occasional columns through the end of the year.\n\n\u2014 Janet Stevens is deputy editor of The Bulletin.
