(AP) \u2014 A man accused of plotting a suicide bomb attack on a Kansas military base to help the Islamic State group is mentally ill and was acting strangely days before his arrest, according to a Muslim cleric who said he was counseling him at the FBI\u2019s request.\n\nJohn T. Booker Jr., 20, of Topeka, was charged Friday with planning a suicide attack at Fort Riley, about 70 miles west of Topeka. Prosecutors allege he told an FBI informant he wanted to kill Americans and engage in violent jihad on behalf of the terrorist group, and said he believed such an attack was justified because the Quran \u201csays to kill your enemies wherever they are,\u201d according to a criminal complaint.\n\nAuthorities arrested Booker as he was trying to arm what he thought was a 1,000 pound bomb outside the Army post, according to prosecutors. The criminal complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Topeka charges him with three crimes, including attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction.\n\nThe top federal prosecutor for Kansas also charged another Topeka man, Alexander E. Blair, 28, with failing to report Booker\u2019s plans to authorities. The complaint alleges that Blair and Booker shared some \u201cextremist views\u201d and that Blair loaned Booker money to rent space to build and store a bomb.\n\nImam Omar Hazim of the Islamic Center of Topeka told The Associated Press that two FBI agents brought Booker to him last year for counseling, hoping to turn the young man away from radical beliefs. Hazim said the agents told him that Booker suffered from bipolar disorder, characterized by unusual mood swings that can affect functioning.\n\nHazim said he expressed concerns to the FBI about allowing Booker to move freely in the community after their first encounter.\n\nHazim said he later heard that two others were involved in a bombing plot with Booker. He said the FBI told him they were undercover FBI agents and that the sting was arranged to get Booker \u201coff the streets.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Cleric: Man charged in Kansas bomb plot is mentally ill", "title": "Cleric: Man charged in Kansas bomb plot is mentally ill", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Cleric: Man charged in Kansas bomb plot is mentally ill", "title": "Cleric: Man charged in Kansas bomb plot is mentally ill", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/04/11/cleric_man_charged_in_kansas_bomb_plot_is_mentally_ill/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/bomb-plot-kansas.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Cleric: Man charged in Kansas bomb plot is mentally ill", "title": "Cleric: Man charged in Kansas bomb plot is mentally ill", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/bomb-plot-kansas.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Nicholas Clayton and John Hanna", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The top federal prosecutor for Kansas also charged another Topeka man, Alexander E.
