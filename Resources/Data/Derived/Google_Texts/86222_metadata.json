We are bullish on automated vehicles.\u201d\n\nMr. Foxx said that the multimillion-dollar pledge could ultimately eliminate as many as 25,000 fatalities each year by reducing the number of traffic accidents attributed to human error, and urged the tech and automobiles industries to work together towards perfecting driverless car technology.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re entering a new world here, and we know it,\u201d he said at the event while flanked by representatives from Google and General Motors. \u201cWe ask ourselves what if human error could be eliminated? That is a possibility worth pursuing.\u201d\n\nCurrent statistics suggest as many as four of five accidents are due to mistakes on the driver\u2019s part, Mr. Foxx said.\n\nThe department\u2019s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration will begin drafting legal framework to encourage consistent rules nationwide for self-driving cars, he said. Currently, rules for autonomous autos differ from state to state.\n\nIn a statement, the department said the earmark is intended to \u201caccelerate the development and adoption of safe vehicle automation through real-world pilot projects.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are on the cusp of a new era in automotive technology with enormous potential to save lives, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and transform mobility for the American people,\u201d the transportation secretary said, adding the administration\u2019s plan \u201cwill provide the foundation and the path forward for manufacturers, state officials and consumers to use new technologies and achieve their full safety potential.\u201d\n\nPresident Obama said Tuesday during his final State of the Union address that the U.S. would \u201cput tens of thousands of Americans to work building a 21st century transportation system.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month, GM said it was investing $500 million toward similar research it will conduct alongside Lyft, one of the world\u2019s leading ride-sharing companies, to establish a network of \u201con-demand, autonomous\u201d automobiles.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Obama administration on Thursday pledged $4 billion toward a 10-year plan that would fund research and development projects related to autonomous automobile technology in hopes of putting self-driving cars on American streets during the next decade.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The Obama administration on Thursday pledged $4 billion toward a 10-year plan that would fund research and development projects related to autonomous automobile technology in hopes of putting self-driving cars on American streets during the next decade.", "title": "Obama admin pledges $4B toward self-driving cars", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/jan/15/obama-admin-pledges-4-billion-toward-self-driving-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/01/15/Auto_Show_Self_Driving_Cars.JPEG-0a9e9.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/01/15/Auto_Show_Self_Driving_Cars.JPEG-0a9e9.jpg", "description": "The Obama administration on Thursday pledged $4 billion toward a 10-year plan that would fund research and development projects related to autonomous automobile technology in hopes of putting self-dri", "card": "summary", "title": "Obama admin pledges $4B toward self-driving cars"}, "Author": "Andrew Blake", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Disaster Accident, Environment, Technology Internet, Business Finance, Anthony Foxx"}, "article_summary": "The department\u2019s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration will begin drafting legal framework to encourage consistent rules nationwide for self-driving cars, he said.\nThe Obama administration on Thursday pledged $4 billion toward a 10-year plan that would fund research and development projects related to autonomous automobile technology in hopes of putting self-driving cars on American streets during the next decade.\nCurrently, rules for autonomous autos differ from state to state.\nAnthony Foxx, secretary of the U.S. Department of Transportation, told attendees at the Detroit Auto Show that the president will ask Congress to earmark about $3.9 billion in the 2017 budget to bankroll the decade-long effort.\n\u201cIf the government doesn\u2019t change its ways, drivers in the future will not be moving on the highways \u2014 they will be crawling in traffic,\u201d he said."}
