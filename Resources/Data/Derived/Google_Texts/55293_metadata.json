In developing countries, and increasingly in U.S. cities, cars will move at bicycle rickshaw speed, thereby continuing to provide an occupation for street vendors who can sell you nearly anything while you\u2019re stuck in traffic, including that night\u2019s dinner.\n\nOr we could innovate our way out of traffic jams by investing now in the infrastructure for solutions that already exist. By improving physical mobility, we would improve economic and social mobility by increasing access to a good education and jobs.\n\nIn this second, more hopeful, scenario, highways, bridges, tunnels and city streets will be sensor-laden, interacting with smartphones and vehicles over wireless networks. Apps will help cars spot bicycles and refuse to open doors until bikes have passed. Apps will tell blind people when they\u2019ve wandered outside the lines at a street crossing\u2013I call this a seeing-eye phone. Apps will permit you to order dinner from a digital billboard you pass that knows your menu preferences and will organize delivery by the time you get home. And there will be less traffic because sensors will provide better information and better management, to keep things moving and cleverly reroute autonomous vehicles even before human passengers\u2013formerly drivers\u2013notice the situation, because they\u2019ll be busy doing office work through in-vehicle connections.\n\nRegardless of who owns vehicles\u2013more likely you\u2019ll own a timeshare in a pool of vehicles, summoned when needed\u2013or who is driving, a person or the software, there will be fewer cars and trucks on the road at any one time, contributing to fewer delays and cleaner air. Dynamic pricing (roads that charge higher user fees at times of high demand) will discourage casual venturing out. Autonomous vehicles wirelessly connected to parking information will zoom directly to a spot without clogging streets. And there could be a big prize: more and better mass transit.\n\nMore people will use mass transit and feel that it\u2019s personalized to them and their needs. For example, Bridj, a 2014 startup using big data to map routes, offers on-demand bus service that promises to pick up and deliver passengers within a five-to-seven-minute walk. Kiosks at bus stops will make them desirable destinations, not just places to wait. Hybrid vehicles will include flying cars; a Massachusetts company already sells models classified as air transportation and requiring air strips, but imagine when they could lift us over the traffic. This is better than drones.\n\nThe Holy Grail of integrated data will enable seamless connections across modes of transportation. A single bar code will get people from office to bus to train to flight and back, and each will \u201cknow\u201d when others are delayed, to make changes faster.\n\nEntrepreneurs are ready. The auto industry is climbing on the smartphone-connected bandwagon. Industries creating software are eager to be in the transportation business. The wild card is public support. Apps can be developed quickly, but for projects modernizing rail or making roads and bridges smarter, the lead time can be 10 years just for approval. So I\u2019m hedging my bets about the future in the U.S., until there\u2019s political will to create a smarter, more mobile future.\n\nRosabeth Moss Kanter (@RosabethKanter) is the author of \u201cMOVE: Putting America\u2019s Infrastructure Back in the Lead,\u201d to be published May 11, 2015.
