The competitive scholarship supports deserving young people who have overcome challenges in their lives in order to pursue higher education. For Jaime, this means she\u2019s one step closer to achieving her dream of going to college and becoming a health care professional.\n\nRed Cloud Indian School is located on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, where the annual per capita income is only $8,768 and six out of ten children live in poverty. Education is a major challenge on the reservation where only 12 percent of residents have earned a bachelor\u2019s degree. At Red Cloud however, 90 percent of Jaime\u2019s friends will go on to pursue higher education or post-secondary training after graduation.\n\nTeachers and administrators say the high-quality curriculum, student-focused environment and programs that honor Lakota culture make all the difference.\n\nTo earn the scholarship, Jaime wrote several personal essays where she reflected on overcoming adversity in her life, how a person supported and inspired her, and how she will prevent future challenges from holding her back. Jaime noted that the application was difficult, but with the help of Anne Grass, one of her teachers, she was able to write strong essays and meet her deadlines.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m proud of Jaime. She has developed an impressive work ethic and consistently goes above and beyond, turning in multiple drafts of work after pouring over notes and readings.\u201d said Grass. \u201cI get a lot of inspiration from her and believe she is very deserving of this honor.\u201d\n\nFor her essays, Jaime focused on one of the biggest challenges she had ever faced and how she was able to continue toward her goal with the support of her family and her faith.\n\n\u201cAround the same time that my parents divorced there were two suicides\u2014a family member and my best friend,\u201d explained Jaime. \u201cIt was one of the hardest times in my life, but my grandma helped me get back into my culture. She took me to a sweatlodge ceremony and to other ceremonies, and it was the start of my healing process.\u201d\n\n\u201cJaime is someone who really relies on faith, both Lakota and Catholic,\u201d said Grass. \u201cAnd I think it\u2019s phenomenal to see a student utilize her spirituality and overcome adversity again and again.\u201d\n\nAs Jaime healed, her faith grew stronger and helped her maintain a positive outlook on life. Today, her spirituality continues to help steer and support her as she prepares for, and considers the next chapter in her life.\n\nNow, as a 2015 Horatio Alger scholar, Jaime is looking to the future with wide eyes and nervous excitement.\n\n\u201cWhen I looked at my email and I saw the word \u2018congratulations,\u2019 I seriously bawled tears of happiness,\" said Jaime. \"It\u2019s just such an honor, I\u2019m really happy to get this.\u201d\n\nThe Horatio Alger Association states on their website that they have awarded $100 million in scholarships to approximately 20,000 students across the country since 1984. The association supports low-income students by granting need-based awards to applicants who have demonstrated integrity, academic potential and a \u201cpersonal aspiration to make a unique contribution to society.\u201d Jaime will receive $7,000 to apply toward her college tuition next year.\n\nShe is still waiting to hear back from her top schools: Dartmouth College and Creighton University. Jaime knows that every little bit will help her afford her dream of becoming a nurse, which can cost upwards of $50,000 per year.\n\n\u201cFor a while I wanted to be a police officer, then a social worker, then a lawyer,\u201d she said. \u201cI tried to narrow down my options and I thought about how I like to help people and I thought about what I\u2019m good at in school\u2014my science and anatomy classes. I remembered back to my sophomore year, when my grandfather passed away from cancer. I remembered seeing the nurses and I realized that\u2019s what I want to do; that\u2019s how I can help.\u201d\n\nWhile Jaime waits to hear back from her top schools, she continues to keep herself busy as the school\u2019s girls basketball team manager, applying for additional scholarships and dreaming about the future.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a busy time,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I know everything will be figured out by August. I\u2019m ready to close this chapter in my life and start the next one. But it\u2019s going to be hard leaving this place\u2014Red Cloud has been really good to me. When I become a nurse, I\u2019ll definitely come back and hopefully get a job at the Indian Health Services hospital.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jaime Rae Richards, a senior at Red Cloud Indian School, has earned the prestigious Horatio Alger Scholarship.
