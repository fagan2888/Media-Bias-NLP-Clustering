Yes, it\u2019s going to radically transform the entire health care marketplace and lead to significant cost increases for families and taxpayers. But no matter what the costs, the Obama administration told us, Obamacare is necessary because there were roughly 49 million Americans without health insurance in 2010, and something had to be done about it.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nAlthough the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services estimates between 9 and 10 million people have enrolled through health care exchanges so far in 2015, President Barack Obama still refuses to release or is unable to calculate the number of people who did not have health insurance prior to the passage of the ACA who are now covered.\n\nFor all the praises heaped on Obama for his signature program\u2019s alleged success, no one outside of a select few in Washington, D.C. has any clue whether the ACA is actually helping large numbers of impoverished Americans.\n\nAlthough hard data is not available to the public\u2013which is odd if Obamacare really is the wild success so many of its proponents claim\u2013new clues released by the Treasury Department suggest the ACA has been a massive failure at helping the poor attain health insurance.\n\nAccording to a top federal tax official, 36 million Americans failed to purchase health insurance in 2014. Interestingly, an estimated 30 million of those people qualified for a penalty exemption under the ACA despite not having a qualified health insurance plan.\n\nAccording to healthcare.gov, the primary exemptions for avoiding the Obamacare tax penalty are incarceration, living abroad for particular lengths of time, membership in a federally recognized Native American tribe, select religious affiliations, if the lowest-priced coverage available through the exchange would cost more than 8 percent of household income, membership in a health care sharing ministry, and financial hardship.\n\nBy examining data we do have about those groups and comparing it to the number of people the Treasury Department says will be eligible for an exemption, it\u2019s easy to see that impoverished citizens are deliberately choosing not to sign up for Obamacare even though the primary purpose of the law was to help this very demographic.\n\nData shows there are about 6 million incarcerated Americans, about 1 million Native Americans living on tribal lands, and likely less than 1 million who would qualify for religious exemptions, assuming the largest groups are the Amish and Mennonites. If we add another 4 million people to the total to account for Americans living abroad, a figure that gives Obama the benefit of the doubt, there are roughly 18 million Americans remaining who can\u2019t afford Obamacare, believe the cost to be too prohibitive, or are members of a health care sharing ministry because the insurance offered is more affordable.\n\nNo matter how the Obama administration wants to spin it, there are more than 15 million Americans\u2014far more than the number who actually enrolled through an exchange\u2014who have decided against Obamacare despite qualifying for some sort of financial exemption.\n\nIf Obamacare, with all of its costs, regulations, and mandates, is necessary to help the tens of millions of Americans who did not have health insurance prior to the passage of the ACA, why have so many people who are poor enough to qualify for an Obamacare tax exemption found the exchanges to be anything but affordable?\n\nJustin Haskins (Jhaskins@heartland.org) is an author, blogger, and editor at The Heartland Institute, a leading free-market think tank based in Chicago, Illinois.", "article_metadata": {"description": "From its inception, the Affordable Care Act (ACA)\u2014popularly called Obamacare\u2014 has been touted as the necessary fix for the nation\u2019s health care system needed prior to its passage.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "From its inception, the Affordable Care Act (ACA)\u2014popularly called Obamacare\u2014 has been touted as the necessary fix for the nation\u2019s health care system needed prior to its passage.", "title": "If Obamacare Is Saving the Impoverished, Why Are So Few Signing Up? - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/Obamacare-website-laptop-AP.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/02/07/if-obamacare-is-saving-the-impoverished-why-are-so-few-signing-up/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "From its inception, the Affordable Care Act (ACA)\u2014popularly called Obamacare\u2014 has been touted as the necessary fix for the nation\u2019s health care system needed prior to its passage.", "title": "If Obamacare Is Saving the Impoverished, Why Are So Few Signing Up? - Breitbart", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/Obamacare-website-laptop-AP.jpg", "creator": "@TheNewRevere", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": ",Big Government, Obamacare,obamacare", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "published_time": "2015-02-07T12:15:20-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,Obamacare"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf940\"", "article_summary": "Yes, it\u2019s going to radically transform the entire health care marketplace and lead to significant cost increases for families and taxpayers.\nAccording to a top federal tax official, 36 million Americans failed to purchase health insurance in 2014.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERFrom its inception, the Affordable Care Act (ACA)\u2014popularly called Obamacare\u2014 has been touted as the necessary fix for the nation\u2019s health care system needed prior to its passage.\nBut no matter what the costs, the Obama administration told us, Obamacare is necessary because there were roughly 49 million Americans without health insurance in 2010, and something had to be done about it.\nInterestingly, an estimated 30 million of those people qualified for a penalty exemption under the ACA despite not having a qualified health insurance plan."}
