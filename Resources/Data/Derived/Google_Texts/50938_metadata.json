Winteregg, a high school teacher looking to take down one of the most powerful Republicans in Congress, released a campaign ad on Sunday that was styled exactly like a commercial for Viagra, a drug that helps men with erectile dysfunction.\n\n\u201cYou make a great team,\u201d the ad\u2019s narrator says. \u201cIt\u2019s been that way since the day you met. But your electile dysfunction? It could be a question of blood flow. Sometimes, when a politician has been in D.C. too long, it goes to his head and he just can\u2019t seem to get the job done.\u201d\n\nThe narrator goes on to promise that Winteregg will keep the border secure, protect Americans\u2019 Second Amendment rights and defund Obamacare and Planned Parenthood.\n\nBut how will a voter know if Boehner really does have electile dysfunction? Side effects include skin discoloration and golf. And, of course, if your Boehner lasts too long, be sure to seek immediate medical attention.\n\nWatch the ad below:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "The Speaker of the House's primary challenger wants voters to consider an important question: Does John Boehner (R-Ohio) have electile dysfunction?", "title": "Campaign ad: John Boehner has \"electile disfunction\" - Red Alert...", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://redalertpolitics.com/files/2014/04/J.D.-Winteregg-Boehner-electile-dysfunction-600x295.jpg", "height": 295}, "url": "http://redalertpolitics.com/2014/04/14/campaign-ad-john-boehner-electile-disfunction/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "app_id": 529886110401651}, "msvalidate.01": "0F003B4674EABE0F24651B476B61A43C", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RedAlertPolitics", "tag": "viagra", "published_time": "2014-04-14T14:03:34+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-04-14T14:03:34+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc033\"", "article_summary": "The Speaker of the House\u2019s primary challenger wants voters to consider an important question: Does John Boehner (R-Ohio) have electile dysfunction?\nBut how will a voter know if Boehner really does have electile dysfunction?\nBut your electile dysfunction?\nAnd, of course, if your Boehner lasts too long, be sure to seek immediate medical attention.\nWatch the ad below:"}
