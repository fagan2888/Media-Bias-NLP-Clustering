Some judges have held that as long as a law has a \u201crational basis\u201d and does not prevent most women from getting an abortion, it does not impose an undue burden. But others have suggested that laws making abortions harder to get must have a good reason for doing so.\n\n\u201cStates can protect unborn life, but they have to do so in ways that reason with women, rather than just interpose obstacles to women,\u201d said Reva Siegel, a Yale Law School professor who has written about Roe v. Wade. \u201cThese laws do interpose obstacles, and they claim to do so on women\u2019s behalf, and the question is whether that purpose is a legitimate one.\u201d\n\nThe Texas lawsuit, brought by abortion providers, challenged the requirement that abortion facilities meet the standards for ambulatory surgical centers. Those standards, which include hallway widths and pipelines for anesthesia, have proven too expensive for most Texas clinics to meet. Fewer than 10 clinics in the state \u2014 and none in the Lower Rio Grande Valley or West Texas \u2014 will remain open if the provision goes into effect Sept. 1, as scheduled. United States District Judge Lee Yeakel, who is hearing the Texas case, is expected to rule before then.\n\nSupporters say the regulations will make abortions safer; critics argue that they have no medical justification and are intended to limit abortions by forcing clinics to close.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe number of abortion providers has dropped to fewer than 20 from 41 in 2012 because of regulations that went into effect in November requiring doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals. Judge Yeakel struck down that requirement, which mirrors laws passed in several other states in recent years, in October, but the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit blocked his ruling immediately and reversed it in March.\n\nIn the Fifth Circuit ruling, Judge Edith H. Jones held that since there was at least a rational basis for believing the law would make abortions safer, and it would not prevent \u201ca large fraction\u201d of women in the state from getting an abortion, it did not impose an undue burden. She dismissed the argument that greater driving distances alone could violate that standard.\n\nOther courts have taken a different view. In December, Judge Richard A. Posner of the Seventh Circuit held in a case about a Wisconsin admitting-privileges law that the undue burden test required judges to weigh the state\u2019s justification for the law against its effects on women seeking abortions.\n\n\u201cThe feebler the medical grounds, the likelier the burden, even if slight, to be \u2018undue\u2019 in the sense of disproportionate or gratuitous,\u201d Judge Posner wrote. \u201cIt is not a matter of the number of women likely to be affected.\u201d\n\nJudge Myron H. Thompson of United States District Court followed a similar approach in striking down Alabama\u2019s admitting-privileges law on Monday, holding that the restrictions did not serve enough of a medical purpose to justify shutting down three of the state\u2019s five clinics.\n\nThe Wisconsin case is still in progress, but if the Seventh Circuit strikes down that law, the disagreement among appeals courts would create a \u201ccircuit split,\u201d said John Robertson, a law professor at the University of Texas at Austin.
