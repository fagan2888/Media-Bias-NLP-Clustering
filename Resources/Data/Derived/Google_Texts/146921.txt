To the Editor:

The Supremes (U.S. Supreme Court), a coequal branch of our Republic, is changing law and not interpreting the constitutional value of laws passed by the legislative branch and signed by the executive branch.

Chief Justice John Roberts, when confirmed for the judicial branch, vowed to be “an umpire” on all rulings before him, meaning “an official in a sport who rules on plays.”

Strike one, a foul ball, was when the Affordable Care Act mandated all citizens buy health insurance or face a monetary penalty. At the time, the chief justice changed the mandate to a tax, thus giving our legislative branch the constitutional justification of this law and legit under the commerce clause, even though the word tax is not written in the law.

Strike two was another foul ball. The ACA says tax credits apply to health care recipients in exchanges “established by the state.” Under the interpretation by the executive branch, the states not having their own exchanges and on the government exchange were given subsidies on signing up for insurance. Again, the chief justice changed the wording to read “exchanges established by the states or by way of the federal government” is constitutional when the four simple words really don’t say it.

Strike three was when the Supreme Court backed a social shift on same-sex marriage. The chief justice said, “Celebrate the availability of new benefit. But do not celebrate the Constitution. It had nothing to do with it.”

The Constitution says nothing about marriage or abortion.
