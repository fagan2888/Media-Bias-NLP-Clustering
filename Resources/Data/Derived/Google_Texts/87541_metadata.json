Trump profanely promising to bomb the Islamic State and Senator Ted Cruz promising to \u201ccarpet-bomb them into oblivion.\u201d A narrator warns in a deep, ominous tone: \u201cOne of these Republicans could actually be president.\u201d Gov. Chris Christie is seen menacingly ordering a New Jersey man to \u201csit down and shut up.\u201d\n\nThe narrator invokes \u201ctheir agenda,\u201d as Jeb Bush says he wants to \u201crepeal Obamacare,\u201d Mr. Trump says that \u201cwages are too high\u201d and Mr. Cruz calls for defunding Planned Parenthood.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re backward, even dangerous,\u201d the voice-over warns. Lumping the four Republicans, with an eyes-downcast Senator Marco Rubio, together on screen, then squeezing them out of the frame, the ad asks, \u201cWho\u2019s the one candidate who can stop them?\u201d The answer it provides is Mrs. Clinton, with a clip of her delivering testimony before the House committee investigating the Benghazi attacks. \u201cTested, and tough,\u201d the narrator calls her. \u201cTo stop them, stand with her.\u201d\n\nThe Message\n\nThough the ad blasts the Republican contenders, it draws an unstated contrast between Mrs. Clinton and her main rival for the Democratic nomination, Senator Bernie Sanders, suggesting that he lacks the experience and toughness to defeat any of them in November. The image of Mrs. Clinton withstanding some 11 hours of questioning in the Benghazi hearing reinforces her point, and allows Mrs. Clinton to turn that ordeal into a positive. She had recently refrained from attacking Mr. Trump, but the ad opens with a quick clip of the candidate, and calls him one of the five \u201cbackwards\u201d candidates.\n\nFact Check\n\nMr. Trump has said that in his remark about wages, in a Republican debate in November, he meant that the minimum wage should not be raised, not that wages generally were too high.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhere\n\nNew Hampshire and Iowa broadcast stations.\n\nTakeaway\n\nThis is an ad meant to resonate with the Democratic base, magnifying the danger posed by the potential Republican nominees to make Mrs. Clinton\u2019s battle-hardened experience seem an essential asset for whomever Democrats choose as their standard-bearer \u2014 and one that only she possesses.",
