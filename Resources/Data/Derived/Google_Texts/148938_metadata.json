Campbell Soup said in a statement, \u201cWe expect the NFL to take appropriate action.\" \u201cDomestic violence is completely unacceptable,\u201d said PepsiCo, referring to the charge against Ray Rice for knocking out his now-wife. But the company, differing wildly from Anheuser-Busch, then praised the NFL for its handling of the situation. \u201cWe are encouraged to see the NFL is now treating this with the seriousness it deserves,\u201d the company said.\n\n[READ: The Tragic Cycle of Child Abuse]\n\nYahoo! Sports Eric Edholm said the NFL will start to realize the magnitude of its problems once \u201cthe dollars grow wings.\u201d Edholm wrote, \u201cWe're not there yet with all the major sponsors, but when the beer folks start issuing stern statements \u2026 it's a shot across the league's bow.\u201d\n\nSome say the beer giant\u2019s statement wasn\u2019t \u201cstern\u201d at all. Anheuser-Busch \u201cis not actually doing anything, or even threatening to do anything, or even hinting at the possibility of considering maybe doing anything,\u201d wrote Deadspin\u2019s Barry Petchesky. However, he added, \"even this milquetoast statement, which doubtlessly required many fraught committee meetings to see the light of day, is still a pretty big deal.\"\n\nSome NFL team sponsors have reacted more aggressively. Radisson hotels announced Monday it had suspended its Minnesota Vikings team sponsorship following allegations that Peterson beat his son with a switch. \"Radisson takes this matter very seriously particularly in light of our long-standing commitment to the protection of children,\" the company said in a statement. Nike also suspended its endorsement of Peterson on Wednesday, just as the Vikings reversed course and booted the football star from their lineup, placing him on an exempt list.\n\n[GALLERY: Cartoons on the Economy]\n\nUltimately, no one looks good when it comes to the recent scandals, wrote Mashable\u2019s Sam Laird:\n\n", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Op-Ed [Opinion]", "title": "Budweiser, Radisson Call Out NFL On Ray Rice, Adrian Peterson", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Some companies called out the league for its handling of the Ray Rice and Adrian Peterson cases.", "title": "Views You Can Use: NFL Sponsors Aren't Happy", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2014/09/17/budweiser-radisson-call-out-nfl-on-ray-rice-adrian-peterson", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/46/b3/38347b0d4671a582a69ac3d44ba7/140917-budweiser-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Budweiser, Radisson Call Out NFL On Ray Rice, Adrian Peterson", "description": "Some companies called out the league for its handling of the Ray Rice and Adrian Peterson cases.", "card": "summary", "site": "@USNews"}, "site": "opinion", "date_published": "Sept. 17, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Rachel Brody,football,NFL,Op-Ed [Opinion]", "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Some companies called out the league for its handling of the Ray Rice and Adrian Peterson cases."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfafe\"", "article_summary": "Some NFL team sponsors have reacted more aggressively.\nRadisson hotels announced Monday it had suspended its Minnesota Vikings team sponsorship following allegations that Peterson beat his son with a switch.\n\u201cDomestic violence is completely unacceptable,\u201d said PepsiCo, referring to the charge against Ray Rice for knocking out his now-wife.\nBut the company, differing wildly from Anheuser-Busch, then praised the NFL for its handling of the situation.\n\u201cWe are encouraged to see the NFL is now treating this with the seriousness it deserves,\u201d the company said."}
