He\u2019s said that as a candidate Trump has \u201cmajor defects\u201d and his supporters can\u2019t be reasoned with. He also admitted that he wishes he could\u2019ve endorsed another candidate. The examples go on and on and on.\n\nNow, however, he has said that he\u2019d probably be in the 'Never Trump' camp too if the stakes in this election weren\u2019t so high.\n\nSpeaking with Denver radio host Krista Kafer last week, Carson said his support has to do with \u201cpragmatism\u201d alone.\n\n\u201cIn terms of who can potentially win, I think that would be Donald Trump. When I look at the consequences of not winning, it\u2019s too horrible to even think about.\u201d\n\nKafer followed up by saying she can\u2019t bring herself to vote for him under any circumstances.\n\n\u201cTo consciously vote for a man who is a bad man, a liar and fraud, I could never cast that vote,\u201d she said, adding that she hopes Carson\u2019s influence on him will help him personally.\n\nCarson insisted one has to look at the big picture. \u201cIf [the nominee is] Trump, I\u2019ll be there. If it\u2019s Cruz, I\u2019ll be there, because I recognize that not voting is a vote for Hillary,\u201d he said, and \u201ca win for the Democrats will just be devastating.\u201d\n\nKafer respected his position but insisted she still couldn't vote for Trump.\n\n\u201cFor me it\u2019s about the children and the grandchildren,\u201d Carson explained, adding that \u201cIf it were just me, I would be completely where Krista is\u2026 but for them, I can\u2019t.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ringing endorsement. .05/26/2016 19:16:05PM EST.", "author": "Leah Barkoukis", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Ringing endorsement.", "title": "Leah Barkoukis - Trump Surrogate Ben Carson Says He'd Be 'Never Trump' Too If Stakes Weren't So High", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/leahbarkoukis/2016/04/12/trump-surrogate-ben-carson-says-hed-be-never-trump-too-if-stakes-werent-so-high-n2147300", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/71/2016-03-11T145322Z_1_LYNXNPEC2A0Z2_RTROPTP_3_USA-ELECTION-TRUMP.JPG", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Ringing endorsement.", "title": "Leah Barkoukis - Trump Surrogate Ben Carson Says He'd Be 'Never Trump' Too If Stakes Weren't So High", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/leahbarkoukis/2016/04/12/trump-surrogate-ben-carson-says-hed-be-never-trump-too-if-stakes-werent-so-high-n2147300", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/71/2016-03-11T145322Z_1_LYNXNPEC2A0Z2_RTROPTP_3_USA-ELECTION-TRUMP.JPG", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Trump Surrogate Ben Carson Says He'd Be 'Never Trump' Too If Stakes Weren't So High, Leah Barkoukis, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "Now, however, he has said that he\u2019d probably be in the 'Never Trump' camp too if the stakes in this election weren\u2019t so high.\nCarson insisted one has to look at the big picture.\nHe\u2019s said that as a candidate Trump has \u201cmajor defects\u201d and his supporters can\u2019t be reasoned with.\nSpeaking with Denver radio host Krista Kafer last week, Carson said his support has to do with \u201cpragmatism\u201d alone.\n\u201cIn terms of who can potentially win, I think that would be Donald Trump."}
