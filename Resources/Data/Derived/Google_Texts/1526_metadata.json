The remainder died after they were enrolled.\n\nThe state paid at least $325,030 to managed care providers for claims associated with 230 of the 354 deceased enrollees, the audit found.\n\nDiNapoli\u2019s auditors also found that the exchange often created multiple account numbers for individual enrollees, costing taxpayers as much as $3 million in overpayments.\n\n5 THINGS TO KNOW ABOUT UPCOMING U.S. SUPREME COURT RULING ON OBAMACARE\n\nState health officials defended the exchange, noting that the audit covered a period when the health exchange was in its infancy and arguing that the federal government has been slow to initiate a program to check enrollees against death records.\n\nOfficials also rejected DiNapoli\u2019s claim that auditors were denied access to information.\n\n\u201cTo accommodate (the controller), the department offered to pull case samples and to provide (the controller) opportunities to conduct \u2018over the shoulder\u2019 reviews of eligibility determinations,\u201d said Health Department spokesman James Plastiras.\n\n\u201cThese offers were declined by OSC auditors, who instead chose to rely on the Medicaid claims processing system, which only permits the user to look up enrollees on an individual basis. In other words, the only impediments to the audit were created by the OSC auditors.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.credits": "NEW YORK DAILY NEWS", "sailthru.author": "GLENN BLAIN", "twitter": {"description": "Death was not an impediment to receiving Medicaid benefits from New York\u2019s Obamacare health insurance exchange, a new audit revealed.", "title": "Dead got $3.4M in Medicaid from N.Y.
