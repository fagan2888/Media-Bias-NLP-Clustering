R. Reid has been elected board chair of the Colorado Foundation for Universal Health Care, a group supporting the fast-growing statewide movement to provide a cooperative health care plan for everybody in the state at reduced cost.\n\n\u201cThe Colorado Health Care Cooperative would be a win-win-win for Coloradans,\u201d Reid said. \u201cIt gets everybody covered. It saves billions in administrative costs. And it gets Colorado out of ObamaCare.\u201d\n\nUnder Section 1332 of the Affordable Care Act, or \u201cObamaCare,\u201d any state that sets up a health care system for all its residents is permitted to \u201copt out\u201d of the federal health care reform. \u201cOnce we set up our health care cooperative, the mandates, regulations, and penalties in ObamaCare won\u2019t apply to Colorado any more,\u201d Reid explained.\n\n\u201cThe basic principle is simple,\u201d Reid said. \u201cWe\u2019re convinced that Coloradans can design a health care system for ourselves that is better than anything Washington wants to impose on us. So we want to take advantage of the opt-out provision in the federal law.\u201d\n\nThe Foundation and its political arm, Co-operate Colorado, are working towards a ballot initiative in 2016 to create a Colorado-based nonprofit cooperative health care plan that would cover everyone in the state from birth until they go on Medicare at age 65. After 65, the plan would provide supplemental coverage. Independent studies have shown that cooperative plans have significantly lower premiums than commercial health insurance. They do not rely on restrictive \u201cnarrow networks\u201d through which insurance companies dictate which doctors and hospitals a patient can see.\n\nThe organization\u2019s program is based on the plan for a Colorado cooperative that was designed by State Sen. Irene Aguilar, a physician on the board at Denver Health who is widely considered the leading authority on health policy in the state legislature. Reid, a Denver resident, has become a nationally recognized advocate for improved health care because of his best-selling book \u201cThe Healing of America\u201d and three films he made for PBS comparing the U.S. health care system to those in other industrialized democracies.\n\n\u201cAll the advanced, free-market democracies in the world provide high-quality health care for everybody, but spend about half as much as we do,\u201d Reid said. \u201cWe could definitely create a system as comprehensive and efficient as the ones I saw in France, Japan, Germany, etc.\u201d\n\nSeveral national publications, including The New York Times and The Economist, have recently dubbed Colorado \u201cthe new California\u201d because the state has become a national leader on public policy issues, including education, fracking, and legalized marijuana. In the same way, the foundation expects a cooperative health care plan here to prompt similar programs for universal coverage in other states.\n\n\u201cThe political scientists call this the \u201cdemonstration effect,\u201d Reid said. \u201cIf one state undertakes a new approach to a long-standing policy problem\u2014as Colorado did with marijuana\u2014other states will see it working and follow the leader.\u201d Since Coloradans voted to legalize marijuana two years ago, four other states and the District of Columbia have done the same.\n\n\u201cWe think Colorado could also be a national leader on the road to universal health care,\u201d Reid added. \u201cOnce our state makes it work, this idea is likely to spread across the country.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cObamaCare\u201d law was designed to provide health insurance to more Americans \u2014 but not to everybody. Even if it works perfectly, ObamaCare will leave some 30 million Americans uninsured, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Many experts have said that further expansion of health coverage will have to be achieved state-by-state, because Congress is too polarized to make a significant change at the national level.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\nTumblr\n\nReddit\n\nGoogle\n\nPinterest\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPocket\n\nEmail\n\nMore\n\nPrint\n\n", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "thecherrycreeknews.com", "description": "Best-selling author and PBS filmmaker T.
