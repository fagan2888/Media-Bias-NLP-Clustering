Rick Santorum will announce Wednesday that he will launch another bid for the Republican presidential nomination. He will make his formal entry into the race at an event at a manufacturing company in his hometown, Butler, PA.\n\nNow that he\u2019s running for president again, many analysts and voters may recall Santorum\u2019s controversial assertions during his 2011 campaign. His frequent comparisons of same-sex relationships to inanimate objects like trees, basketballs and paper towels became a major punchline of the campaign cycle.\n\nBut here are ten equally outrageous comments he\u2019s made that you may not remember:\n\nPutting women in combat is a bad idea because of \u201cemotions that are involved.\u201d Women\u2019s \u201cemotions\u201d may render them unworthy soldiers and thus not fit for the battlefield, according to the former Pennsylvania senator. \u201cPeople naturally may do things that may not be in the interests of the mission because of other types of emotions that are involved,\u201d Santorum said after the Pentagon eased restrictions on women in combat in 2012. He has also made dire warnings about what would happen to the military after Don\u2019t Ask Don\u2019t Tell was repealed and gays were allowed to openly serve.\n\nAmerican culture is being corrupted by \u201cthe NBA\u201d and \u201crock concerts.\u201d According to Santorum, our culture and manners and decency have been collectively ruined by the NBA, among other culprits. These remarks came during a 2008 speech at Ave Maria University: \u201cThe corruption of culture, the corruption of manners, the corruption of decency is now on display whether it\u2019s the NBA or whether it\u2019s a rock concert or whether it\u2019s on a movie set.\u201d Of course, just like his anti-welfare rant against \u201cblah\u201d people, there\u2019s certainly no racial undertone to decrying the NBA as chipping away at American culture and decent manners.\n\nHis top issue in 2012 was opposing \u201call forms of pornography.\u201d During his 2012 presidential bid, Santorum vowed to oppose \u201call forms of pornography\u201d if elected president. In fact, pornography was the top issue on his campaign\u2019s website. He warned that \u201cAmerica is suffering a pandemic of harm from pornography,\u201d which \u201ccauses profound brain changes in both children and adults, resulting in widespread negative consequences.\u201d\n\nObamacare is (a) like apartheid, (b) a plot to kill the opposition\u2019s voters, and (c) the \u201cfinal death knell\u201d of America. Santorum\u2019s anti-Obamacare arguments regularly delve into the absurd. Following Nelson Mandela\u2019s death, Santorum memorialized the former South African leader by noting that, like apartheid, \u201cwe have a great injustice going on right now in this country [\u2026] and Obamacare is front and center in that.\u201d More than that, Obamacare is actually a Trojan Horse to \u201cget rid of\u201d voters who oppose the government, he later argued. Worst of all, Obamacare will, according to Santorum in his 2012 campaign, be the \u201cfinal death knell\u201d of America.\n\nIf you don\u2019t have an ID, you\u2019re trying to rig the election. More than one in ten Americans don\u2019t have a government-issued photo identification, like a driver\u2019s license or a passport. And, according to a study by the Brennan Center for Justice, minorities and low-income citizens are more likely than others not to have a government-issued photo ID. But to Santorum, each one of these millions of individuals aren\u2019t disenfranchised voters; they\u2019re out to commit fraud. \u201cThe only reason you don\u2019t have a voter ID is you want to continue to perpetrate fraud,\u201d he told ThinkProgress during his 2012 presidential bid.\n\nEven if it survives Obamacare, \u201cour country will fall\u201d because of same-sex marriage. The government recognizing gay people\u2019s love will be the downfall of America, according to Santorum. \u201cThe family is the bedrock of our society, unless we protect it with the institution of marriage, our country will fall,\u201d he declared in 2011.\n\nHe believes consensual sex between gay people should be illegal. Until 2003, states were still permitted to outlaw sodomy. Though those statutes were struck down in a landmark Supreme Court case that year, as recently as 2011, Santorum was still wishing for the good old days when states could tell gay people what they can and cannot do in the bedroom. He told radio host Bradlee Dean, \u201c[I] said this is wrong. We can\u2019t do this, we can\u2019t have a constitutional right to consensual sexual activity, no matter what it is.\u201d\n\nIn Obama\u2019s America, religious people are on \u201cthe path\u201d to being beheaded. During a Texas town hall in 2012, Santorum predicted that America was on the road toward beheading religious people because of their faith. Discussing anti-religious sentiment during the French Revolution, Santorum argued that \u201cwe\u2019re a long way from that, but if we do and follow the path of President Obama and his overt hostility to faith in America, then we are headed down that road.\u201d\n\nAfter Jerry Sandusky sexual assault revelations, he defended Penn State. Former Penn State assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky is currently in prison serving a 30-60 year sentence for molesting young children. But Santorum, an alumni of Penn State, rushed to the university\u2019s defense after an investigation found that officials had covered up evidence of Sandusky\u2019s misdeeds. \u201cA lot of the conclusions in the Freeh report aren\u2019t matched by the evidence that they presented,\u201d he declared during a radio appearance.\n\nHealth insurance companies should discriminate against people with pre-existing conditions. There\u2019s a belief among some conservatives that insurance companies should be permitted to discriminate against people with pre-existing conditions, though they leave open the question of whether or not insurers ought to do that. Not Santorum. According to the former Pennsylvania senator, people with pre-existing conditions \u201cshould pay more.\u201d After all, they\u2019re \u201cgoing to be very expensive to the insurance company and, you know, that cost is passed along to us.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "It's hard to remember all the absurd statements Rick Santorum has made over the years.
