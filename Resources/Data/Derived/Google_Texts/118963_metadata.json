She had been hitting up health industry officials for help in implementing the sprawling legislation, Kliff reported.\n\nMany of the calls from Sebelius, noted Kliff, went to boosters of a group called Enroll America, a nonprofit dedicated to promoting Obamacare enrollment. \u201cSecretary Sebelius recognizes how important the work Enroll America is doing, and we\u2019re thrilled to be working with her,\u201d said Enroll America President Anne Filipic as part of a statement in the story.\n\nBig scoop: Sebelius took heat for her activities from Republicans in Congress, and she has since desisted from the practice.\n\nCompetitive scoop, too. As the Washington Examiner reported yesterday, two days before Kliff\u2019s piece surfaced, Fox News reporter Joe Weber was poking around on the matter. He contacted Cate Bonacini at Enroll America and asked about a tip he\u2019d received that Sebelius was \u201cfundraising\u201d on behalf of Enroll America.\n\nThe response? Bonacini told Weber that, to her knowledge, there was \u201cno truth\u201d to the tip.\n\nHow do we know about these private interactions? The Examiner used a Freedom of Information Act request to procure e-mail traffic between Enroll America staffers and officials at the Department of Health and Human Services. (The documents are embedded below.) Here\u2019s a (partial) look at Bonacini\u2019s e-mail:\n\nHi all, I just received a call from Joe Weber at Fox News. He received a tip that Secretary Sebelius has been fundraising on our behalf. He asked me point blank if this was true. I told him that someone would get back to him, but to the best of my awareness, there was no truth to it.\n\nAnother Enroll America staffer quickly replied, \u201cDid you say that off the record?\u201d Let\u2019s hope so!\n\nThe FOIA documents show an extensive back-and-forth over the Fox News inquiry, though a great deal of the record has been redacted by HHS.\n\nIn any case, the Examiner reports that Weber, after getting bogus information, never received a call back to correct the record. Fox News didn\u2019t respond to the Erik Wemple Blog\u2019s request for comment.\n\nEnroll America must have an explanation. When we asked about the veracity of the Examiner account and whether anyone had told the truth to Weber, we got this explanation by e-mail from Enroll America\u2019s national press secretary, Justin Nisly: \u201cI wasn\u2019t here during that time \u2013 in fact those were early days and our full-time communications staff weren\u2019t hired until months later \u2013 so I don\u2019t really have much to add about that email discussion.\u201d No surplus of accountability there.\n\nNisly continued:\n\nWhat I can tell you is that we\u2019ve been entirely forthcoming about Secretary Sebelius\u2019 support for our enrollment efforts, and that support is in line with a long, bipartisan tradition in which non-profits helped with the launch of Medicare Part D under President Bush, the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program under President Clinton, and even the President\u2019s Council on Physical Fitness under President Reagan. We\u2019ve voluntarily cooperated with every Congressional request for information, and no one has yet been able to point to any evidence of wrong-doing or even impropriety. We\u2019re focused on our mission, which is to make sure as many uninsured Americans as possible are able to find quality, affordable coverage for themselves and their families.\n\nBonacini now works at Families USA, which shares the goals of Enroll America. The Erik Wemple Blog left her a voice-mail message, which triggered a call from Families USA communications director David Lemmon. No talking to Bonacini, said Lemmon. \u201cCate doesn\u2019t talk to the media on the record,\u201d said Lemmon, who said this policy protects employees from being put in \u201cuncomfortable circumstances.\u201d\n\nNo one in the world of Obamacare promotion will bemoan Fox News\u2019s setback. The network runs a stream of often misleading and loaded programming designed to cast public skepticism on the Affordable Care Act. At perhaps its most extreme, the anti-Obamacare strain last fall included a Fox News host raising an eyebrow over the decision of NBC News to deliver consumer-friendly information on how to sign up for health insurance. And just weeks before Weber made his inquiry about Sebelius and Enroll America, Fox News chief Roger Ailes was cited in a biography as saying he would kill Obamacare if he had the power to do so (and he may yet).\n\nThe Fox News party line doesn\u2019t assist someone like Weber in his efforts to pry stories out of the Beltway health-care world. Yet it doesn\u2019t come close to excusing the treatment he received. Outraged by the misleading response to Weber\u2019s inquiry, the Erik Wemple Blog asked Enroll America\u2019s Nisly if the organization had apologized to the Fox News reporter. We got this response:\n\nEnroll America was in start-up mode, our systems were not yet in place, and it was a mistake that one of our staffers gave incorrect information about something they weren\u2019t fully informed on and that nobody got back to the reporter \u2014 it\u2019s not one we would repeat now that we have full-time communications staff on board.\n\nHHS emails obtained by the Washington Examiner.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A nonprofit organization gave Fox's reporter bad information, then never corrected itself.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/erik.wemple", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "A nonprofit organization gave Fox's reporter bad information, then never corrected itself.", "title": "Did Fox News get cheated out of Obamacare scoop?", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2014/03/11/did-fox-news-get-cheated-out-of-obamacare-scoop/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=http://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/files/2013/10/Sebelius-300x205.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@ErikWemple"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2014/03/11/did-fox-news-get-cheated-out-of-obamacare-scoop/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Fox News, Washington Examiner, Obamacare, Kathleen Sebelius,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/erik.wemple"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "Fox News, Washington Examiner, Obamacare, Kathleen Sebelius,"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe218b\"", "article_summary": "He contacted Cate Bonacini at Enroll America and asked about a tip he\u2019d received that Sebelius was \u201cfundraising\u201d on behalf of Enroll America.\nMany of the calls from Sebelius, noted Kliff, went to boosters of a group called Enroll America, a nonprofit dedicated to promoting Obamacare enrollment.\nAnother Enroll America staffer quickly replied, \u201cDid you say that off the record?\u201d Let\u2019s hope so!\n\u201cSecretary Sebelius recognizes how important the work Enroll America is doing, and we\u2019re thrilled to be working with her,\u201d said Enroll America President Anne Filipic as part of a statement in the story.\nHere\u2019s a (partial) look at Bonacini\u2019s e-mail:Hi all, I just received a call from Joe Weber at Fox News."}
