Children\u2019s advocates in California are worried that Congress might use funding of the program as a bargaining chip.\n\n\u201cThis is a critical source of funding for California\u2019s children, and across the nation,\u201d said Alison Buist, health policy director of Children\u2019s Defense Fund-California. She said half the children in California are covered by CHIP and Medi-Cal. \u201cWe know this program has strong bipartisan support in Washington,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re afraid it could get caught up in partisan politics over other issues.\u201d\n\nCongress is expected to revisit current funding of the Affordable Care Act in the next session, and Buist doesn\u2019t want this particular issue to be held hostage in that negotiation.\n\nIn an Oct. 30 letter to Congressional leaders, California HHS Secretary Diana Dooley urged quick action on extending CHIP funding scheduled to expire in September 2015.\n\n\u201cIf federal CHIP funds are not renewed for \u2026 2015, California could lose upwards of $553 million annually,\u201d Dooley wrote. \u201cRenewal of federal CHIP funding is extraordinarily important to California\u2019s fiscal stability and the ability to offer cost-effective, affordable coverage for children and pregnant women.\u201d\n\nEven though the program is funded until September 2015, state budgets are being designed now, Buist said. In California, the proposed budget is due from the governor by Jan. 10, 2015.\n\n\u201cStates need to have certainty of what funds are available,\u201d Buist said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been pushing for this to be taken care of as quickly as possible. States just can\u2019t wait.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is an important investment in children\u2019s health care,\u201d Dooley wrote. \u201cThe loss of such funding would put gains in children\u2019s and infants\u2019 health coverage at risk.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "<p>California HHS Secretary Diana Dooley came out strongly in favor of continued federal funding of the Children's Health Insurance Program, but the funding has yet to be approved by Congress.</p>", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "California Healthline", "description": "California HHS Secretary Diana Dooley came out strongly in favor of continued federal funding of the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, but the funding has yet to be approved by Congress.", "title": "State Asking for Continued CHIP Funds", "url": "http://californiahealthline.org/news/state-asking-for-continued-chip-funds/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/kaiser-californiahealthline/static/images/placeholder.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@CalHealthline", "card": "summary", "creator": "@CalHealthline"}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "application-name": "California Healthline", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WordPresscom", "published_time": "2014-11-21T03:00:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-21T03:00:00+00:00"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://californiahealthline.org/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1093\"", "article_summary": "States just can\u2019t wait.\u201d\u201cThis is an important investment in children\u2019s health care,\u201d Dooley wrote.\nThe Brown administration has formally requested continued funding of the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program.\nChildren\u2019s advocates in California are worried that Congress might use funding of the program as a bargaining chip.\n\u201cIf federal CHIP funds are not renewed for \u2026 2015, California could lose upwards of $553 million annually,\u201d Dooley wrote.\nIn an Oct. 30 letter to Congressional leaders, California HHS Secretary Diana Dooley urged quick action on extending CHIP funding scheduled to expire in September 2015."}
