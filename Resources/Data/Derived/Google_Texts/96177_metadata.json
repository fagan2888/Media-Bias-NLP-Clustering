Today, its innovation is centred on the development of its streaming video arm, where it has showed unstinting commitment and enjoyed significant success.\n\nThis week IP&TV News spoke to Yaoshiang Ho, Vice President, Head of Business Development, about The Huffington Post\u2019s plans for an increasingly multimedia future\u2026\n\nWe know you oversee some very interesting work at the The Huffington Post. Could you please give us some examples of how video is playing an increasingly significant and central role to the group?\n\nVideo is a linchpin of our future growth strategy for all the reasons we know \u2013 every chart and graph shows that video consumption and monetization is both a large healthy business, and ripe for new entrants.\n\nHuffPost Live is the core of our video strategy. It\u2019s led by Roy Sekoff, the founding editor of The Huffington Post. We generate eight hours of live programming five days a week from our in-house studio in New York. This live content is then edited into hundreds of short clips every week, which has allowed us to create an incredible library of original video content. This content helps to power and accompany content on huffingtonpost.com and Aol.com. We\u2019ve recently hit 1.4bn video views in the 23 months since launch, all of it monetized at premium rates.\n\nKey to our programming vision is our involving community \u2013 that\u2019s part of the HuffPost DNA we\u2019ve brought into video. We believe that anyone with \u201cskin in the game\u201d is worth hearing from. For example, we don\u2019t only want the perspective of a pundit on healthcare. We also want to hear from people who have been personally impacted by Obamacare.\n\nWhat have been the main challenges and achievements presented by live streaming network HuffPost Live?\n\nLet\u2019s start with the achievements. One major accomplishment is the great user engagement we\u2019re seeing. We have created a very unique social and community offering. More than 22,500 guests having joined us on air from all over the world via Skype and Google Hangouts. Additionally, we have received over 1.6 million comments on the HuffPost Live platform in response to our video content. And, users are spending an average of 18 minutes on the site per visit.\n\nAnother achievement is the interest from brands like MillerCoors, Citi and American Express. They are seeing the value of our brand and audience, and have been buying our premium packages.\n\nAdditionally, the industry is also acknowledging our success. In May, HuffPost Live won its second consecutive Webby as the Best News and Information Channel. Digiday named HuffPost Live the Best Video Platform for 2013. Other awards include a Gracie and an NABJ award.\n\nNow on to the challenges. Fundamentally, it\u2019s about trying to stay ahead of the rapidly changing landscape. There are all kinds of changes in consumer behaviour, the regulatory landscape, industry structure, and capabilities of the players in the industry. For example, mobile consumption has grown to become more than half of HuffPosts\u2019s audience in the 2 years since HuffPost Live launched, and we all know mobile video consumption patterns are different than desktop. Staying on top of changes, making predictions about what they mean for our business, and then testing those hypotheses is something we are doing constantly.\n\nHow do you envisage the balance between text and video playing out for media outlets such as The Huffington Post?\n\nText and video complement each other and each has its place depending on the audience and what they need at a specific moment. This is one of the reasons we created HuffPost Live \u2013 to take the written content and conversation that was already happening on Huffington Post to the next level in video.\n\nWhat opportunities do you think the growth of the second screen present?\n\nPeople are certainly watching more and more video on their phones, tablets, and laptop screens, and that\u2019s a trend that\u2019s only going to increase. I broadly put that concept under the \u201cOTT\u201d banner and it\u2019s something we obviously believe in \u2013 just look at our apps for Smart TVs, iOS, tablets, and Roku / other devices to get Internet video on your TV.\n\nBut looking at second screen from the perspective of stand-alone apps that enable check-ins, chat rooms, rewards, etc., well, that hasn\u2019t been an area we think can move the needle for our business today.\n\nI think what second screen was trying to solve was creating engagement with linear TV. At HuffPost Live, our take on that concept is much deeper \u2013 we\u2019re trying to build the most social video experience possible by combining the first screen experience of consumption, with the second screen experience of interacting by actually encouraging the community to be on air.\n\nBesides video, what other areas of multimedia do you expect to grow in importance over the coming years and how do you best take advantage of them?\n\nBesides text and video, audio is the main media format we need to take a harder look at. Events are an area we\u2019ve invested in already with successes such as our recent Thrive event. There is always more to do with involving the community \u2013 our blogging platform has been core to who we are for our entire 9 year history, but what could it become over the next 9 years? Finally, we know mobile created a very different consumption pattern \u2013 what will wearables do? People are still going to want to know when major news breaks, but is one device treated as secondary to another? Or is there room for commentary and opinion? Does lack of screen size (and assuming no good goggle / \u201cGoogle Glass\u201d type technology emerges), do wearables push consumption format back towards audio?\n\nYou\u2019ll be appearing at TV Xperience. What is the value of attending this specific event?\n\nThe topics that TV Xperience focuses on are really critical to what so many players are dealing with on a daily basis \u2013 multiscreen experience, monetize multi-platform, using data to enhance product offering. I look forward to leaving the conference more informed, and I hope my participation will be a factor in others saying the same.\n\nYaoshiang Ho will be appearing at this year\u2019s TVXperience (October 13-15 , Convene Center, New York), for booking and more info go here.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "huffpost live,news,the huffington post,interview,iptv,ott tv,tv tech", "description": "This week IP&TV News spoke to Yaoshiang Ho, VP, Head of Business Development, about The Huffington Post's plans for an increasingly multimedia future", "generator": "WordPress 3.5.1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd10d5\"", "article_summary": "As a media organisation, The Huffington Post remains way ahead of the curve \u2013 as it has since its emergence almost ten years ago.\nIt\u2019s led by Roy Sekoff, the founding editor of The Huffington Post.\nThis live content is then edited into hundreds of short clips every week, which has allowed us to create an incredible library of original video content.\nWhat have been the main challenges and achievements presented by live streaming network HuffPost Live?\nHow do you envisage the balance between text and video playing out for media outlets such as The Huffington Post?"}
