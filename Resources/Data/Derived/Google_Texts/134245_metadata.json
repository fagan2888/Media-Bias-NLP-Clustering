The upcoming filing season will be the first for two major components of the health law \u2013 the premium tax credit and the individual mandate.\n\nWith the agency in charge of determining eligibility and handing out penalties, IRS Commissioner John Koskinen has already warned that 2015 could be the worst tax-filing season on record.\n\nKoskinen, who took over the embattled agency earlier this year, has spent much of his tenure warning that the agency needs more funding. He called the new ObamaCare provisions \u201cperhaps our most intense challenge.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am deeply concerned about the ability of the IRS to continue to fulfill its mission if the agency lacks adequate funding,\u201d Koskinen told the House Ways and Means Committee at a hearing in September.\n\n\u201cOur current level of funding is clearly less than what the agency needs, especially to provide the level of taxpayer services the public has a right to expect,\u201d he testified, warning that the agency needs more employees to keep pace with the growing demand.\n\nThe IRS has already been dogged by Republicans for lacking the ability to immediately verify people who qualify for ObamaCare.\n\nEarlier this year, Koskinen also noted that the agency spent $330 million in 2014 alone to bolster its web infrastructure, though \u201cnone of that money was provided\u201d and it was then forced to halt other programs.\n\nThis year\u2019s spending battle was focused on Obama's immigration action and barely raised the issue of ObamaCare, a vast shift from last year\u2019s 16-day government shutdown in Sen.
