And the same goes for 2013.\n\nDuring the CNBC Republican presidential debate on Oct. 28, three candidates made a version of the claim about business deaths:\n\nSen. Rubio said, \u201cYou have small businesses in America that are struggling. For the first time in 35 years, we have more businesses closing than starting.\u201d\n\nFormer Florida Gov. Bush claimed, \u201cYou think about the regulatory cost and the tax cost \u2014 that\u2019s why small businesses are closing, rather than being formed in our country right now.\u201d\n\nFormer Hewlett-Packard CEO Fiorina said that the U.S. has \u201c400,000 small businesses forming every year\u201d and \u201c470,000 going out of business every year. And why? They cite Obamacare.\u201d (Those numbers are close to what Census says was the case in 2009, a year before the Affordable Care Act was even signed into law.)\n\nThe source of this claim is a Brookings Institution report from May 2014 titled \u201cDeclining Business Dynamism in the United States,\u201d which found that \u201cbusiness deaths now exceed business births for the first time in the thirty-plus-year history of our data.\u201d That\u2019s according to data from the Census Bureau\u2019s Business Dynamics Statistics through 2011. The numbers showed that firm exits outnumbered firm entries in 2009 for the first time since this information was collected in the late 1970s. That was also the case for 2010 and 2011.\n\nThe Brookings report looked at \u201cfirm\u201d startups and closings, rather than \u201cestablishments,\u201d which Census also measures. Firms are individual businesses, while establishments include multiple outlets for existing firms. The Brookings report specifically discussed entrepreneurship, which is why it used the numbers for firms. \u201cThe distinction between a new Chase Bank branch opening in your neighborhood versus a brand new community bank is critical \u2014 particularly when studying entrepreneurship,\u201d Ian Hathaway, one of the authors of the report, told us via email in May, when we first looked at this claim.\n\nHathaway also sent us a chart with what was then the most recent data from Census, released in September 2014, that showed firm deaths in 2012 (424,864) still outnumbered births (410,001). That\u2019s a difference of 14,863, and the figures showed that the gap had been narrowing each year since deaths first outnumbered births by 90,670 in 2009. We, in fact, cited those numbers in writing about Fiorina\u2019s claim in the Oct. 28 debate.\n\nBut, it turns out, Census had released new numbers for 2013 in September of this year. And in doing so, it revised its figures for past years. The latest statistics now show that in 2012, firm births (411,252) were higher than firm deaths (375,192) by 36,060.\n\nAnd the same held true for 2013, when births outnumbered deaths by 5,666. We can expect that figure to be revised, too, when Census releases new figures in the future. (To see firm births, look at the firm age tables for those age zero.)\n\nBut the latest numbers show that more firms are opening than closing, making this GOP talking point now false.\n\nWhy would the Census numbers for 2012 change, from about 15,000 more firm deaths in last year\u2019s release to now about 36,000 more births? Census explains that the figures for business entry and exits take multiple years into consideration. They\u2019re estimates. So when data from another year become available, that affects the previous years\u2019 numbers. (That 90,000-plus gap in 2009 has been revised as well, down to nearly 85,000.)\n\nCensus Bureau, Business Dynamics Statistics data page: The BDS uses longitudinal information on firms and establishments to generate measures of business dynamics and job flows. Since information from multiple years is used to produce a statistic for any given year, having more years of data surrounding the year in question improves the quantity and quality of information used to generate the statistics. Thus, less information is available to generate the last year(s) of any given BDS release. Measures of job flows from firm and establishment births are especially sensitive to this source of measurement error and accordingly are more likely to be revised in subsequent releases.\n\nWe spoke with Ronald Davis, survey statistician with the Census Bureau\u2019s Center for Economic Studies, who told us: \u201cThe number of the last year can change by a good amount when the next year\u2019s data come along.\u201d\n\nOn an FAQ page, Census further explains that it adjusts the data for outliers or anomalies. It says that certain entry/exit data may be deemed to be not credible, so they are excluded. For example: \u201cAn establishment might fail to report one year; this should not be treated as an exit followed by an entry.\u201d\n\nDavis also explained that while total firms are a \u201csimple count\u201d of what is in the data, the entry and exit data are \u201cadjusted by code that looks for things that should be excluded from the flows.\u201d\n\nThe Brookings report indicated that the deaths-outnumber-births trend may in fact reverse, saying in its conclusion: \u201cTo be sure, three years have passed since our latest data were collected in March 2011, so it\u2019s entirely possible that some of these negative trends have reversed\u2014or at least stabilized \u2014 since then.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s exactly what has happened.\n\nAs for why firm deaths would have outnumbered births from 2009 to 2011, Brookings didn\u2019t determine causes, but said the trend matched that of business consolidation in the country. \u201cOur findings stop short of demonstrating why these trends are occurring and perhaps more importantly, what can be done about it,\u201d the report said. \u201cBut it is clear that these trends fit into a larger narrative of business consolidation occurring in the U.S. economy \u2014 whatever the reason, older and larger businesses are doing better relative to younger and smaller ones.\u201d\n\nLooking at the firm birth and death rates \u2014 as opposed to the sheer numbers \u2014 shows that what Brookings found was part of a long-term trend. The death rate has hovered around 9 percent for decades, while the firm birth rate has fallen. It was 15 percent in 1978, 10 percent in 1999, and down to 8 percent in 2011, according to Brookings\u2019 calculations.\n\nHathaway coauthored another paper, for the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, in August 2014 that said there had been a shift away from brand-new businesses toward new outlets of existing businesses, a trend that many Americans may have seen in their own communities.\n\n\u201cThe Shifting Source of New Business Establishments and New Jobs,\u201d Aug. 21, 2014: We find that while new firms have been forming at a slower pace over the past 33 years and creating fewer jobs, there has been a simultaneous rise in the number of new establishments opened by existing businesses (which we will call new outlets). \u2026 Markets that used to be served by independent entrepreneurs creating businesses are now increasingly being served by the expansion of existing businesses.\n\nThis claim has been popular among Republicans, and not just those running for president. Rep. Jeb Hensarling of Texas used the deaths-outnumber-births claim in the GOP weekly radio address in July \u2014 attributing the situation to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and other business regulation. And the House Republican Conference made the same claim in a March online post titled \u201cLive Long and Prosper \u2014 Unless You\u2019re a Small Business.\u201d\n\nBoth of those claims were made when the available Census data still supported them. But the House Republican Conference post remains on the website, even though it\u2019s now incorrect. It says that \u201ceach year under the Obama Administration, more businesses have shut their doors than opened them,\u201d and that hasn\u2019t been true for individual firms since 2011.", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "But the latest numbers show that more firms are opening than closing, making this GOP talking point now false.\nThe latest statistics now show that in 2012, firm births (411,252) were higher than firm deaths (375,192) by 36,060.\n(To see firm births, look at the firm age tables for those age zero.)\nAccording to the Census Bureau\u2019s September 2015 release of these figures, firm births outnumbered deaths in 2012.\nWhy would the Census numbers for 2012 change, from about 15,000 more firm deaths in last year\u2019s release to now about 36,000 more births?"}
