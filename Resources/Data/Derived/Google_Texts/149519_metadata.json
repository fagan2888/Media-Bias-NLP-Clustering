But these days she\u2019s crashing in a friend\u2019s basement in Calgary, Alberta, sleeping on an air mattress, because she needs to be as frugal as she can.\n\nUhlaender is in Canada for five weeks so she can train at the only \u201cice house\u201d in North America, where bobsled and skeleton athletes practice their starts in the summer. She also spends a lot of time fretting about funding.\n\nUhlaender lost her sponsor (Nike), and her monthly stipend from the U.S. Bobsled and Skeleton Federation was cut from $2,000 to $1,750. She was counting on income from the family farm in northwest Kansas, where she spends part of her year working and training, but drought has wiped out that prospect.\n\n\u201cThe problem is, I have no sponsors and I have no cattle income,\u201d Uhlaender said during a phone interview from Calgary.\n\nBut help is trickling in. She has registered on a \u201ccrowd-funding\u201d website called RallyMe, which helps Olympic hopefuls solicit contributions from the public. So far she has received $2,890 through RallyMe, and that has helped her buy two sets of runners for her sled ($1,600), a major relief.\n\n\u201cI raised enough money to get through Calgary,\u201d Uhlaender said. \u201cEveryone who contributed a little bit has made it possible for me to have two sets of runners, and I was able to pay my bills without stressing out.\u201d\n\nWorld Cup superstar Lindsey Vonn has sponsors that make sure she doesn\u2019t need help paying her bills, but ski jumper Lindsey Van does. Van has raised more than $20,000 through RallyMe.\n\nSlalom phenom Mikaela Shiffrin doesn\u2019t need assistance, either, but Mikaela Matthews does, and she has turned to RallyMe.\n\nMatthews, a 21-year-old moguls skier from Frisco who is considered a rising star on the U.S. freestyle team and an athlete to watch for the Sochi Games, will have to pay her own expenses in the coming ski season because she finished 11th on the World Cup circuit last season. The top 10 finishers are fully funded by the U.S. Ski Team.\n\nWhen she can, Matthews earns money by coaching, serving at banquets and babysitting. So far she\u2019s raised $1,326 via RallyMe, toward a goal of $20,000.\n\n\u201cI have to pay for all my travel to World Cups, all my lodging expenses, so the idea of RallyMe is incredibly helpful,\u201d Matthews said from Park City, Utah, where she is practicing her aerial tricks on the water jumps at Utah Olympic Park. \u201cGet your name out there a little bit more, and have a community rally behind you.\u201d\n\nUhlaender will be aiming to make her third Winter Olympics this winter. Her father, Ted, was a major-league outfielder from 1965-72 who died in 2009. Katie wears his 1972 World Series ring when she races.\n\nShe also is trying to make it to the Summer Olympics as a weightlifter. She competed in the Olympic trials last summer and won a silver medal in her weight class at the USA Weighlifting national championships this summer.\n\n\u201cI live for competition,\u201d Uhlaender said. \u201cI\u2019m an athlete, it\u2019s what I do, it\u2019s what I love to do. I compete in everything I do, I can\u2019t help it. If I\u2019m running on a treadmill next to somebody, I\u2019m going to know what (speed) that person next to me is doing, just because I\u2019m competitive. It\u2019s my way of life.\u201d\n\nShe wants to compete through the 2018 Winter Olympics in PyeongChang, South Korea, but she just turned 29 and she is feeling maternal desires. She wants to raise a family on her dad\u2019s farm.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a girl, I want children and the things that go with that,\u201d Uhlaender said. \u201cI want to have as many kids as I can afford, and if that\u2019s going to happen, I can\u2019t wait until I\u2019m 37. But my life right now consists of farming and the Olympics, and I love it. I\u2019m not the kind of girl that\u2019s going to make finding a man a priority. I\u2019ll have to have faith in God\u2019s plan and continue doing what I feel like he wants me to be doing, and everything will fall into place.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, she trains for Sochi with everything she has, because she\u2019s not in it just for herself. \u201cHaving the support from my boosters on RallyMe and my friends and family, it just makes it all that much more necessary for me to put my all into it,\u201d she said. \u201cI could not do this on my own.\u201d\n\nJohn Meyer: 303-954-1616, jmeyer@denverpost.com or twitter.com/jmeyer26", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Katie Uhlaender, other Olympic hopefuls turn to web site to help fund dreams", "title": "Katie Uhlaender, other Olympic hopefuls turn to web site to help fund dreams", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/08/31/katie-uhlaender-other-olympic-hopefuls-turn-to-web-site-to-help-fund-dreams/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130831__20130901_CC3_SP01OLYUHLAENDERp2.jpg", "height": 450}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130831__20130901_CC3_SP01OLYUHLAENDERp2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-08-31T18:17:11+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-30T04:33:31+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cGet your name out there a little bit more, and have a community rally behind you.\u201dUhlaender will be aiming to make her third Winter Olympics this winter.\nShe also is trying to make it to the Summer Olympics as a weightlifter.\nBreckenridge\u2019s Katie Uhlaender is a former world champion skeleton slider and two-time World Cup season champion, credentials that mark her as a medal contender at the Sochi Olympics next February.\n\u201cThe problem is, I have no sponsors and I have no cattle income,\u201d Uhlaender said during a phone interview from Calgary.\nShe has registered on a \u201ccrowd-funding\u201d website called RallyMe, which helps Olympic hopefuls solicit contributions from the public."}
