In other words, he was a comforter.\n\nBush also had some super deep \u201cthoughts\u201d on ISIS, like how it is bad and we should defeat it somehow. Yet in a treacherous move of treachery, which really makes you wonder if he\u2019s even a Republican anymore, he refused to say how it is all Obama\u2019s fault for being a secret terrorist-lover, even though he was given the perfect opportunity to do so:\n\nFirst thing is there has to be a goal, and the president has laid out what I think is a good goal, and that is to degrade and defeat ISIS. Once you state the goal, then you have to put plans in place to achieve the goal. And seems like to me the initial plans are being adjusted, and all I hope is that we succeed, because ISIS is lethal.\n\nSure hope Republicans don\u2019t hear about Dubya\u2019s gushing over the current president\u2019s \u201cgood goal,\u201d or they might have to IMPEACH!", "article_metadata": {"description": "George Dubya gave an interview on CNN and said some stuff.
