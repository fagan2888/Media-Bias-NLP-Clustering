In 2012, Citizens Bank was the 10th-largest bank in the market.\n\nPlainsCapital, City Bank and Prosperity held the first second and third spots for the seventh consecutive year. The three represent just over 49 percent of the market.\n\nCalifornia-based Wells Fargo remains the fourth-largest bank in the market, followed by Lubbock National Bank and FirstBank & Trust.\n\nOf the 25 banks that carried over from 2012\u2019s list, 20 increased their funds on deposit, led by Happy State Bank\u2019s 374 percent rise.\n\nThe Amarillo-based bank ranked 26th in the market in June 2012 with about $8.9 million after only five months in town. It grew by about $33 million in deposits over the next 12 months and now is ranked 20th of the 28 banks.\n\nNine other banks posted double-digit percentage increases in funds on deposit in the June 2013 report.\n\nDavid Seim, Happy State\u2019s Lubbock market chairman, said the bank, which will celebrate its second anniversary in the Hub City next month, is continuing to grow rapidly. In addition to the ongoing increase in funds on deposit, he said, the local operation\u2019s loan volume has already passed the $200 million mark.\n\nAnd, he said, he\u2019s confident the growth will continue, especially with the early growth of the oil and gas sector locally.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m seeing trucks carrying oil field equipment or material something related to the industry,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t remember seeing that before.\u201d\n\nEven with 28 players in the market, Seim said, it\u2019s hard to consider Lubbock \u201coverbanked.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of banks, but most of them are community banks \u2014 banks that lend in the community,\u201d Seim said. \u201cWhen banks generate loans, jobs are being created.\u201d\n\nLes Eubank, PlainsCapital Bank\u2019s Lubbock president, says he sees an improving local economy with customers still cautious about the future.\n\nAnd, he said, that should mean another strong year for bank deposits.\n\n\u201cPeople are still a little afraid of the markets,\u201d Eubank said.\n\nEubank said he, like most Lubbock bankers, would like to see a stronger loan demand.\n\nWhile lending is improving, he said, there\u2019s still apprehension in the market about long-term uncertainties \u2014 such as taxes, Obamacare, and the health of the economy \u2014 that\u2019s keeping businesses from incurring long-term debt.\n\n\u201cIf people had a better feel for the economy as a whole, they would be going in and making capital investments. It will just take time for our borrowers to see that,\u201d he said.\n\nExpansion helped Peoples Bank, ranked as the seventh largest in the market, muster an increase in deposits of nearly 15 percent, said Larry Allen, the bank\u2019s chairman of the board and chief executive officer.\n\n\u201cWe opened a new branch in Slaton last year, and we opened a new branch in Post,\u201d Allen said, adding that the bank was also fortunate \u201cto hire some great people with good relationships in other institutions.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the banking world, people bank with people, not institutions,\u201d Allen explained.\n\nAllen also noted the growing presence of \u201coil money\u201d in the local economy coming from leases in the region.\n\nAt the same time, he said, the pace of borrowing has slowed, including in the agricultural sector, which Allen said makes up about half of Peoples\u2019 loan portfolio.\n\n\u201cIt was a good year for some, but not others,\u201d Allen said. \u201cIt depended on where you were and how much rain you got.\u201d\n\nBarry Orr, chairman and chief executive officer of FirstBank & Trust, said his institution\u2019s growth in the last year was about an aggressive approach to retail banking, buttressed by FirstBank\u2019s new cashback checking product.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s received widespread acceptance in the community,\u201d Orr said.\n\nFirstBank\u2019s 15 percent boost in funds on deposit came from \u201ca nice blend of new people moving into the community and people migrating from the money center banks,\u201d Orr said.\n\nIn the coming year, Orr explained, FirstBank will reach toward the city\u2019s north and northwest growth corridor with the construction of a new office at 19th Street and Milwaukee Avenue.\n\nGreg Jones, Lubbock executive vice president at Prosperity Bank, said the local operation has experienced some runoff in deposits since the merger was finalized, but the shift is about to stabilize.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re running the bank like we always have,\u201d Jones said, noting that the loss of deposits is a mix of brokered deposits and some customers deciding to change banks.\n\nJones said some individuals are moving money out of banks and back into the stock market over disappointment with the low rates banks are having to pay in the current lending environment.\n\nHome mortgages are still an active loan product, Jones said, noting that rates have climbed back from historic lows to interest rates at about 4.25 percent.\n\n\u201cWe expect another good year in the housing sector,\u201d Jones said.\n\nBusiness borrowing remains cautious, he said, noting that he\u2019s especially concerned about what may happen to agricultural support businesses if the drought continues.\n\nWhile crop insurance will enable the farmers to come out OK with another relatively dry year, the owners of gins, farm implement stores and other supporting businesses don\u2019t have a fall-back if the lack of rain continues.\n\nwalt.nett@lubbockonline.com\n\n\u2022 766-8744\n\nFollow Walt on Twitter\n\n@WaltNett_LAJ", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Business, Walt Nett", "og": {"site_name": "Lubbock Online | Lubbock Avalanche-Journal", "description": "Lubbock area banks take in $6.77 billion in deposits", "title": "Stashing cash: Lubbock banks see funds on deposit growing 4.5 percent", "url": "http://lubbockonline.com/business/2014-01-11/stashing-cash-lubbock-banks-see-funds-deposit-growing-45-percent", "image": "http://lubbockonline.com/sites/default/files/12960338.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "Funds on deposit in Lubbock banks increased by nearly $300 million between July 2012 and June 2013, according to figures compiled by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
