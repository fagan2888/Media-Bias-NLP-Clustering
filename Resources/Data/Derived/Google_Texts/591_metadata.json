Joe Britte of the Gainesville Police Department.\n\nThe annual event pairs local underprivileged children with police officers who accompany them through a store and help them select Christmas presents.\n\nFriday, Britte was present at the Wal-Mart on Shallowford Road as his fellow officers took over 22 local children and their families Christmas shopping for the 12th year of Shop with a Gainesville Cop. Thanks to funding from Wal-Mart and Pilgrim\u2019s Progress, each child received $200 for Christmas presents.\n\nThe children, who were identified by school counselors as being in need, would not have any presents otherwise.\n\n\u201cIt just makes you so happy to see the kids running around, trying to figure out what they want,\u201d said Maj. Carol Martin, interim police chief. \u201cSometimes they\u2019re not able to (choose). It makes you realize how fortunate a lot of people are, how unfortunate others are.\u201d\n\nBritte said they make sure the families know the money can go toward anything they need.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve also told them if they need other items, if they need clothes, if they need groceries, to get it,\u201d Britte said. \u201cIf you need a Christmas meal, go get it. We try to make it as open as possible.\u201d\n\nAll of the officers who helped the children select presents were volunteers.\n\nSaturday morning, members of the Fraternal Order of Police Lodge No. 41 were on hand for their own round of \u201cShop with a Cop\u201d at Target in Gainesville. The group includes officers from Gainesville Police, the Hall County Sheriff\u2019s Office, the Department of Natural Resources and the Georgia State Patrol.\n\nLowell McNeal, the president of the FOP lodge No. 41, said the organization has been holding the event for 25 years thanks to private donations and volunteer officers.\n\nSaturday\u2019s event welcomed a \u201cpreacher\u2019s count\u201d of 35 kids, according to Lowell, each of whom received about $150 for their Christmas gifts.\n\nDonald McDuffie, an FOP chaplain and a 20-year veteran of Shop with a Cop, delivered the prayer that began the Target event.\n\n\u201cBeing in law enforcement for over 24 years, I have seen a lot,\u201d McDuffie said. \u201cTo see unfortunate families who won\u2019t have a Christmas or a Thanksgiving or anything of that nature, and then to find those kids and have them come here and see the way they act and the expression on their face, it\u2019s just phenomenal.\u201d\n\nBut the giving didn\u2019t stop with Christmas.\n\nLt. Shawn Welsh\u2019s teenage son Zach also helped a child select Christmas presents. When he learned the boy wouldn\u2019t have any gifts for his Dec. 26 birthday, Zach bought him a birthday gift with his own money.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just the type of person he is,\u201d Welsh said of his son.\n\nThe kids who attended the FOP Shop with a Cop ended the morning by going through a special cash register reserved just for them. Several went to fetch bags or shopping carts for their officer friends as they rang up their totals.\n\n\u201cI got a vest, Play-Doh, \u2018Monster High\u2019 dolls, clothes, cowgirl boots, and a baby doll and baby doll stuff with it,\u201d said Jalis Cheeks, 7, who said shopping was her favorite part of the event.\n\nMartin expressed pride in her officers who gave up their Friday afternoon or Saturday morning to help bring Christmas to the kids.\n\n\u201cThey just want to help out,\u201d Martin said. \u201cThat\u2019s why they\u2019re in the business they are.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.gainesvilletimes.com/archives/106722/", "image": "http://media.morristechnology.com/webmedia/upload/gainesville/article/2014/12/20/1221SHOP_0008.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "It\u2019s not every day a fully uniformed, gun-toting officer of the law wanders through the kid\u2019s section of a department store, pushing a cart full of \u201cFrozen\u201d toys and taking orders from a 5-year-old in pink sequined boots.", "title": "Shop with a Cop helps youngsters fill Christmas stockings"}, "twitter": {"site": "@gtimes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "title": "Shop with a Cop helps youngsters fill Christmas stockings"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1acb\"", "article_summary": "Lt.
