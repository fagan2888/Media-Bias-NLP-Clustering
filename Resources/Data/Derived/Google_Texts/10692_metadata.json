Luke Vercollone will join the 2015 squad, pending USSF approval.\n\n\u201cI am excited to have Luke as the first signed player for the Switchbacks FC,\u201d said Switchbacks FC Head Coach Steve Trittschuh. \u201cHe is a leader both on the field and off the field and his experience playing in this league will be a tremendous asset to the team. I look forward to building the team around Luke and adding more quality players in the next few weeks.\u201d\n\nMost recently, Vercollone played for Switchbacks FC rival Richmond Kickers in the USL Professional Division.\n\nVercollone started his soccer career in Pembroke, Massachusetts, where he won All-Conference and All-State honors.

Vercollone also played for the Cape Cod Crusaders, which is part of the USL Premier Development League, and helped the team win PDL Championship titles in 2002 and 2003.\n\nIn 2004, Vercollone was drafted 42nd overall into the MLS by the Columbus Crew, but joined the New England Revolution as a developmental player. In 2006, he joined the Charleston Battery for the USL First Division Season. Then in 2008, he signed on with the Richmond Kickers and was part of the team when it won the 2009 USL Second Division Championship. He continued on with the Kickers through the 2014 season.\n\n\u201cI am super excited about joining Colorado Springs Switchbacks FC,\u201d said Luke Vercollone. \u201cSince they were announced last year, it's been my goal to play for them and to continue my professional career in Colorado near family. I'm hopeful to contribute to this team's success on and off the pitch and to help establish a top-level pro soccer team in Colorado Springs.\u201d\n\nVercollone currently lives in Fort Collins with his wife Andrea and their three children, Augustine, who is almost five, Gemma, who is almost three, and Estella, who is six-and-a-half months old.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "The Switchbacks FC has signed its first official player!
