Otherwise, the last refuge is the North Dakota State Hospital, which requires legal action, Duffy-Aziz said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to get those individuals help because they don\u2019t always go to the doctor,\u201d she said. \u201cThey tend to isolate themselves.\u201d\n\nDifferent segments of the population, including resettled refugees and the homeless, might have distinct needs as they age, Roth said.\n\n\u201cWill their needs be different?\u201d Roth said.\n\nBecause the large baby-boom generation began reaching retirement age in 2011, the aging is just beginning. The most challenging cases typically involve those in advanced old age, suggesting greater challenges lie ahead, Duffy-Aziz said.\n\n\u201cWe better get ready for it,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "News,North Dakota,Minnesota,fargo,moorhead,baby boomers,Aging,Public health,Social Services,ndsu extension service", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Patrick Springer", "og": {"site_name": "INFORUM", "description": "FARGO \u2013 Public health and social service providers are planning for the growing wave of aging baby boomers.\r\nA Fargo-Moorhead task force has been meeting and will draft recommendations aimed at helping prepare for a spectrum of needs as people age and require more assistance.\r\n\u201cThe needs are man...", "title": "F-M task force studies needs of aging baby boomers", "url": "http://www.inforum.com/news/3700706-f-m-task-force-studies-needs-aging-baby-boomers", "image": {"width": 300, "identifier": "http://www.inforum.com/sites/default/files/styles/square_300/public/field/image/0316AgingServices1.jpg?itok=iE9plCnP", "height": 300}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "FARGO \u2013 Public health and social service providers are planning for the growing wave of aging baby boomers.\r\nA Fargo-Moorhead task force has been meeting and will draft recommendations aimed at helping prepare for a spectrum of needs as people age and require more assistance.\r\n\u201cThe needs are man...", "title": "F-M task force studies needs of aging baby boomers", "url": "http://www.inforum.com/news/3700706-f-m-task-force-studies-needs-aging-baby-boomers", "image": "http://www.inforum.com/sites/default/files/styles/16x9_430/public/field/image/0316AgingServices1.jpg?itok=jfHkuhrY", "site": "inforum", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1451861908361756}, "keywords": "News,North Dakota,Minnesota,fargo,moorhead,baby boomers,Aging,Public health,Social Services,ndsu extension service", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/inforumFM", "tag": "News,North Dakota,Minnesota,fargo,moorhead,baby boomers,Aging,Public health,Social Services,ndsu extension service", "modified_time": "2015-03-16T03:00:15-05:00"}, "image": {"alt": "People fill the Ed Clapp Senior Center, above and right, at the James Calrson Library on Thursday in Fargo to play bingo.
