NEW YORK (MainStreet) — January is not too early to get your taxes in order, and here are two of MainStreet’s recommendations to stay on track for the IRS.

1. Resolve to become more educated and informed about income taxes

It is impossible to know the right moves you should make in your daily financial life without a basic knowledge of the tax implications of your actions.

You can follow my tax tips and articles throughout the year here at MainStreet. Or take a basic tax course offered by your local Board of Education’s adult or evening education program.

Learn what items you can, and cannot, deduct on your tax return, including the special items that are unique to your trade or profession. Learn the rules governing any special situations that apply to you, and keep up-to-date on federal and state tax law changes.

Even if you use a tax professional to prepare your return, the more informed you are on taxes, the more prepared you will be when you go to your annual appointment.

2. Resolve to keep good tax records

Set up a filing system for maintaining tax records and receipts. You are required to keep good, contemporaneous records of all your income and deductions in the manner prescribed by the IRS and the Tax Code.Go out and buy an accordion file folder. Label the first pocket “Income Tax Returns.” This is where you will put your copy of your federal and state income tax returns once completed.
