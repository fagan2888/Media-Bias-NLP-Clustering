Energy markets are global, and if we substitute natural gas for coal to produce electricity, we will drive coal prices down and gas (and oil) prices higher. (The EPA is projecting that coal prices will drop as much as 17 percent by 2020, and that its use in power generation will decline by up to 27 percent.)\n\nBecause China\u2019s nuclear program is behind schedule, the Chinese are expected to import significant amounts of coal in the years ahead. The new EPA regulations promoted by Obama will make it cheaper for China to do so. Consequently, Chinese manufacturers, who are struggling with rising labor costs, will be more, not less, competitive with U.S. firms that only now are able to bring back to the U.S. production jobs lost overseas \u2013 in part because we offer cheap, secure energy. Obama\u2019s war on coal is not just bad policy; it is an untimely disaster.\n\nRelated: Democrats Inoculate Themselves Against Obama\u2019s Coal Rule\n\nInstead, President Obama could have used our energy bounty to respond to Putin\u2019s numerous provocations with an all-out program to increase U.S. energy. He could have backed an \u201call of the above\u201d strategy, reduced red tape by executive fiat, green-lighted the Keystone XL pipeline, fast-tracked nuclear development and approval for LNG exports \u2013 all intended to put Putin on notice that energy prices will not move higher anytime soon.\n\nPutin desperately needs higher oil prices, to fund his adventures overseas and his promises of higher pay and benefits made to Russians and Crimeans alike. Russia\u2019s growth has slowed, the government has promised to spend $48 billion building up Crimea, and foreign capital is leaving the country. With 70 percent of Russia\u2019s exports and17 percent of the economy dependent on oil, an aggressive U.S. energy policy could have been a powerful weapon.\n\nInstead of declaring a full-out program to boost domestic energy, we will now spend our great energy bounty to drive carbon emissions lower. Americans are being told this is an urgent need \u2013 with President Obama speciously linking carbon emissions with weather disasters and respiratory ailments. This program will be another unpopular, divisive quest by Mr. Obama to secure his legacy; instead it may become an anvil around the country\u2019s neck.\n\nRelated: China Will Now Cap Its Own Co2 Emissions\n\nThe proposed new EPA regulations to reduce power plant carbon emissions will restrict our country\u2019s energy options, leading to the closing of hundreds of coal-fired power plants, and the use of substantially more natural gas to meet the nations\u2019 need for electricity. That trend, of course, is already underway. Cheap (and significantly cleaner) natural gas has gained market share from coal. As a result, emissions in the U.S. are already on the decline \u2013 a victory you don\u2019t hear much about.\n\nBetween 2007 and 2012, greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. dropped by nearly 11 percent. One idea would be to let this market-driven trend follow its constructive course, until circumstances change. It is possible that energy forecasters have been overly optimistic about natural gas resources freed up by fracking; some have detailed alarmingly steep decline curves for new wells produced in this manner. What if the pessimists prove right? We will not easily bring closed coal plants back on stream.\n\nThe U.S. has almost limitless resources of cheap coal, a fuel that accounts for some 40 percent of worldwide electricity and that has been growing faster than oil or gas. Robert Bryce of the Manhattan Institute says, \u201cWe are not the Saudi Arabia of coal; we are the OPEC of coal.\u201d\n\nHe says the Obama move to cut back on coal is \u201crepeating bad history.\u201d In 1978, the United States decided to restrict the use of natural gas; nine years later the legislation was repealed. Bryce is a fan of keeping all energy options available; history has proven that to be a smart bet. He also is a realist about the importance of coal \u2013 not just in the U.S. , but globally.\n\nRelated: Obama Risks the U.S. Economy for a 1.8 Percent Reduction in Co2\n\nSince 1973, according to Bryce, coal use around the world has expanded by 43.6 million barrels of oil equivalent per day. That compares to a jump of 39 mb/d of natural gas and 34 mb/d of oil.\n\nCoal use is up in the U.K., Spain, France and Germany. But, the big user is China, where coal consumption has grown between 2002 and 2012 by about 23 mb/d \u2013 or about 2 \u00bd times the amount of coal burned in the U.S. during 2012. If we don\u2019t want our coal, China will, as will India; those countries have some 900 additional coal-fired plants on the drawing board.\n\nYes, the Chinese are concerned about pollution, but so far, that anxiety has translated into locating coal plants far from congested cities, not banning the fuel\u2019s use. In 2012, China imported more coal than any country in history, and the amount was topped last year by 12 percent.\n\nRelated: Obama Takes Aim at Power Plants to Slow Climate Change\n\nOthers have noted that even a 30 percent drop in U.S. emissions is likely to be overwhelmed by increases elsewhere. The numbers are impressive, and show how insignificant Obama\u2019s environmental gesture will prove. While the U.S. produced 5.3 million metric tons of greenhouse gases in 2012, China emitted 9 million tons; by 2020, China is expected to release 11.5 million tons.\n\n\n\nSome in the country will celebrate Mr. Obama\u2019s war on coal; others, especially Democrats running for office in energy-producing states like Kentucky or West Virginia, are not so happy.\n\nFor Democrats nationally, the EPA rules feed the GOP narrative that job creation has always been a low priority for President Obama, even as it has been the top concern for the country. Perhaps aware that the new regulations are controversial, Mr. Obama allowed EPA head Lisa Jackson to unveil the anti-coal plan; it is rare that the president foregoes a Rose Garden photo-op.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "President Obama\u2019s push to restrict coal usage in the United States", "title": "Obama\u2019s Energy Plan Is a Gift to Russia and China", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2014/06/04/Obama-s-Energy-Plan-Gift-Russia-and-China", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/01012014_Coal_Mine.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2014/06/04/Obama-s-Energy-Plan-Gift-Russia-and-China", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/01012014_Coal_Mine.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@lizpeek"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "President Obama\u2019s push to restrict coal usage in the United States", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af56914bd0286fe4f1c\"", "article_summary": "President Obama\u2019s push to restrict coal usage in the United States is a great gift to China and Russia .\nRelated: Democrats Inoculate Themselves Against Obama\u2019s Coal RuleInstead, President Obama could have used our energy bounty to respond to Putin\u2019s numerous provocations with an all-out program to increase U.S. energy.\nEnergy markets are global, and if we substitute natural gas for coal to produce electricity, we will drive coal prices down and gas (and oil) prices higher.\nThat compares to a jump of 39 mb/d of natural gas and 34 mb/d of oil.\nIf we don\u2019t want our coal, China will, as will India; those countries have some 900 additional coal-fired plants on the drawing board."}
