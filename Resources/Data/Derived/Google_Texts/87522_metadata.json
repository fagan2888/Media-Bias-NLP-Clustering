(Laura Segall/for The Washington Post)\n\nWhen Jeff Flake led a congressional delegation to Cuba nine years ago, he came, as is the custom, bearing gifts for his Communist hosts. But instead of a plaque or trinket, Flake brought copies of \u201cThe Wealth of Nations,\u201d Adam Smith\u2019s seminal economic treatise, and \u201cFree to Choose,\u201d Milton Friedman\u2019s paean to capitalism.\n\nThe gospel of free markets has yet to transform Cuba, but Flake will be in Havana on Friday to witness a milestone he has long advocated during his nearly 15 years in Congress: the reopening of the U.S. embassy and the formal end of a 54-year diplomatic freeze.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be quite a moment,\u201d said Flake, who has visited Cuba a dozen times, adding, \u201cI wish there were some other Republicans.\u201d\n\nThat the junior senator from Arizona will be the only Republican lawmaker in the American delegation accompanying Secretary of State John F. Kerry is the latest reminder of Flake\u2019s unusual willingness to chart his own path on some of the nation\u2019s most divisive issues.\n\nOn a range of matters \u2014 Cuban relations, nuclear negotiations with Iran and immigration policy, to name a few \u2014 Flake has found himself more closely aligned with President Obama than conservatives in his own party.\n\nFlake says he abides by advice he got upon arriving in the House in 2001: \u201cIf you vote consistent enough, then when there\u2019s a vote people don\u2019t understand, they\u2019ll give you the benefit of the doubt.\u201d\n\nIn his six House terms, Flake has carved out a distinct profile as a spending hawk willing to take on anyone \u2014 including his own party\u2019s leadership \u2014 to curb federal profligacy. When Congress banned spending earmarks in 2010, he could rightly claim to have actually changed Washington.\n\n\u201cA true conservative, Flake is as rare as the dodo,\u201d Esquire wrote in 2008. The Weekly Standard in 2011 called him \u201ca tea partier before there were tea partiers.\u201d\n\nIn the years since, the party orthodoxy on spending has only moved closer to Flake. But on other issues, Flake has stuck to his free-market, often libertarian principles even as the party has hardened around other positions, and conservative activists aren\u2019t giving him the benefit of the doubt.\n\nIn the 2012 race for the seat he now holds, he won the endorsement of the Senate Conservatives Fund, a group established by then-Sen. Jim DeMint (R-S.C.) to elect more rock-ribbed candidates.\n\nNow the same group is threatening to support a primary challenger three years before Flake is up for reelection. Ken Cuccinelli II, the fund\u2019s president, said in a statement that Flake has been \u201can embarrassment\u201d to conservatives.\n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s supporting amnesty, gun control, Obamacare funding, or the president\u2019s failed foreign policy, Senator Flake has betrayed the voters who sent him to Washington and should be replaced with a true conservative in 2018,\u201d Cuccinelli said in a statement.\n\nConservative darling to scourge\n\nFlake does not seem particularly shaken by his transformation from conservative darling to scourge. In a series of interviews this year, he said he remains determined to follow his own path.\n\n\u201cLife\u2019s too short,\u201d he said this week. \u201cCertainly my political life is too short to worry about these kinds of things. I would not serve my constituents well by being in lockstep with the party. I wouldn\u2019t be able to justify the time it takes away from my family and everything else if I were just go-along-to-get-along.\u201d\n\nOn spending issues, Flake remains doctrinaire. On the 2016 federal budget, he opposed every amendment that would have hiked spending. He was one of only three senators \u2014 joining Mike Lee (R-Utah) and Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) \u2014 to vote against an amendment opposing Medicaid benefit cuts.\n\nHe holds stellar ratings from the Club for Growth and the National Taxpayers Union. And he has maintained a sharp focus on government waste, highlighting government programs he\u2019d cut in social-media-friendly packages like his recent \u201cJurassic Pork\u201d report or his March Madness-themed \u201cEgregious Eight Tournament of Waste.\u201d\n\nBut with the congressional appropriations process again stalled, Flake has found it difficult to be the kind of spending hawk he was in the House, digging into programs, line item by line item.\n\nAt a Rotary Club luncheon in Sedona in March, Flake described how he made enemies in his own party by calling out earmarkers on the House floor and how a succession of pay-to-play scandals finally led to their demise.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s still a ban on earmarks in Congress, and that\u2019s a good thing,\u201d Flake declared to applause.\n\nBut explaining his conservative bona fides these days requires elaborating on the federal budgetary process \u2014 detailing the demise of \u201cregular order\u201d and the rise of the continuing resolution and the last-minute omnibus spending bill.\n\nThat has left conservative activists to dwell on his more recent positions: His support for comprehensive immigration reform, including the bipartisan Gang of Eight talks; his backing of Obama\u2019s nuclear negotiations with Iran; and his vote to confirm Loretta Lynch as attorney general.\n\n\u201cThere is something that\u2019s fundamentally changed since he\u2019s been in the Senate,\u201d said Dwight Kadar, a retired businessman and Republican activist who came to the Rotary luncheon with a \u201cDon\u2019t Tread on Me\u201d pin on his jacket. \u201cIn fact, I told him . . . \u2018I don\u2019t recognize you anymore. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re really representing Northern Arizona and its values.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe \u2018anti-Ted Cruz\u2019\n\nFlake, 52, and those who know him best insist he hasn\u2019t changed much at all since succeeding former senator Jon Kyl (R). But his unorthodox positions have become a lot harder for conservatives to overlook. That has proved doubly true as Senate classmate Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) gained a prominent national profile through his hard-line opposition to Obama.\n\nInstead, Flake has tried to forge a different kind of conservative identity \u2014 one more focused on a long-term strategy of reining in the federal government rather than winning the next Republican primary.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s sort of the anti-Ted Cruz,\u201d said Clint Bolick, vice president for litigation of the Phoenix-based Goldwater Institute, a free-market think tank Flake once led. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t seem to be consumed by ambition. He\u2019d like to get some things done, and this is the right place and the right time.\u201d\n\nFlake says he\u2019s itching to move beyond spotlighting wasteful programs to \u201cplay a role in the big deal, the grand bargain, if you will\u201d \u2014 referring to the elusive prospect of a bipartisan solution to rein in the national debt.\n\nBut what Flake has witnessed so far in the Senate has disappointed him. His dimmest day in Congress, he says, was when his colleagues killed, 95-3, a provision in the 2013 Ryan-Murray budget deal that would have slightly reduced the annual cost-of-living adjustment for younger military retirees, saving the government $6 billion.\n\n\u201cI thought, if we can\u2019t stand the pressure that comes from a small group like that, how are you ever going to stand up to the broader groups?\u201d he said.\n\nFlake is now playing a more visible role in foreign affairs, his other area of political passion dating back to his days as a young Mormon missionary in South Africa and pro-democracy activist in neighboring Namibia. There, he grew skeptical of American efforts to wall off nations politically and economically in hopes of changing their policies.\n\nOn Cuba, \u201che\u2019s helped many other Republicans to take a second look at the issue, that we don\u2019t need a separate foreign policy on Cuba when we have trade with, diplomatic relations with . . . many other countries we disagree with on human rights issues,\u201d said Phil Peters, a former State Department official who runs the nonpartisan Cuba Research Center and has accompanied Flake on several of his dozen trips there.\n\nAnd Flake\u2019s thinking on the Iran deal is being watched intensely given that his support could give Obama\u2019s efforts at least a patina of bipartisanship.\n\nIn remarks on the Senate floor last week, Flake said he remains undecided and that he could still be convinced to vote in support if he were more thoroughly assured that the U.S. would retain the ability to reimpose sanctions on Iran for supporting \u201cnefarious non-nuclear activities.\u201d\n\nThat position is considerably more nuanced than the defiant line held by most congressional Republicans, and even the possibility that Flake might support the deal has outraged conservatives.\n\nSupport in Arizona\n\nFlake retains strong support in the Arizona business community; holds an enviable political base in the northeastern part of the state, where the Flake family settled in 1878; and, like fellow Arizona Republican John McCain, is hoping his maverick streak works in his favor.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t come to Washington without a clue of what he was doing; he went out there purposely to change things and take on the establishment, and I think that really resonates for people here,\u201d said Brian Murray, an Arizona political consultant who advised Flake\u2019s 2012 campaign.\n\nBolick says Flake is the \u201cideological heir\u201d to his group\u2019s namesake, five-term senator Barry Goldwater. \u201cBy and large, it is the right fit for Arizona.\u201d\n\nTo burnish his profile back home, Flake has staked out a role on the particularly Arizonan issues of fire, water and land management. Still, his refusal to stay in an ideological box has caused him political fits.\n\nSocial conservatives blasted Flake\u2019s 2013 votes for the Employment Non-Discrimination Act and to allow gays and lesbians to serve openly in the military. Liberals and moderates blasted his opposition that year to more stringent federal background checks for gun buyers, and his immigration stance seems to have pleased no one at all.\n\nWhen Flake announced earlier this year that, with comprehensive reform faltering, he was co-sponsoring a bill that would toughen border security without addressing undocumented residents already in the U.S., an Arizona Republic editorial declared him \u201cpart of the immigration problem.\u201d\n\nMore recently, he has co-authored a bill to crack down on so-called \u201csanctuary cities.\u201d But he has broken with GOP colleagues, including Cruz, who want mandatory prison terms for aliens who re-enter the country illegally after being deported.\n\nFlake acknowledges enjoying the luxury of his principles in a non-election cycle: \u201cThere are a lot of good things about the Senate,\u201d he told a gathering of local officials in Sedona. \u201cBut nothing better than a six-year term. Don\u2019t let anyone tell you otherwise.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Once known as a right-wing firebrand, Jeff Flake tries to be a different kind of modern Republican.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/madebonis", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Once known as a right-wing firebrand, Jeff Flake tries to be a different kind of modern Republican.", "title": "Why this lone Republican accompanied Kerry", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-jeff-flake-became-the-senates-most-unorthodox-republican/2015/08/13/8363bb2e-2efb-11e5-97ae-30a30cca95d7_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/08/14/National-Politics/Images/Flake_0071428441906.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@mikedebonis"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-jeff-flake-became-the-senates-most-unorthodox-republican/2015/08/13/8363bb2e-2efb-11e5-97ae-30a30cca95d7_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/madebonis"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "eomportal-uuid": "8363bb2e-2efb-11e5-97ae-30a30cca95d7"}, "article_summary": "\u201cA true conservative, Flake is as rare as the dodo,\u201d Esquire wrote in 2008.\nNow the same group is threatening to support a primary challenger three years before Flake is up for reelection.\nConservative darling to scourgeFlake does not seem particularly shaken by his transformation from conservative darling to scourge.\nKen Cuccinelli II, the fund\u2019s president, said in a statement that Flake has been \u201can embarrassment\u201d to conservatives.\nWhen Congress banned spending earmarks in 2010, he could rightly claim to have actually changed Washington."}
