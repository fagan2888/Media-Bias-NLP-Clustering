‘My Bible says treat your neighbor as you would like to be treated’:

“I admit that I am one that has done this, but there’s so many people that call in and complain and grouse about other people, that I got to thinking, you know, my Bible says treat your neighbor as you would like to be treated, and those who have (not) sinned throw the first stone. So I think a lot of people ought to sit back and think about what they’re doing.”
