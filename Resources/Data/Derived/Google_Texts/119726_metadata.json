Marco Rubio and Rep. Vern Buchanan are both taking heat for their votes over ending the federal government shutdown and raising the debt ceiling Wednesday, but for very different reasons and from disparate directions.\n\nWhile Rubio was blasted by Democrats Thursday for siding with the Tea Party over mainstream Florida in voting against the legislation, conservative groups \u2014 including some in his own backyard \u2014 slammed Buchanan for abandoning his political base in voting to reopen the government without changes to the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe reaction underscores how the Republicans\u2019 strategy painted themselves into a corner, said Darryl Paulson, a retired University of South Florida political science professor. No matter which way they voted, Republican lawmakers exposed themselves to new risks for the next election cycle.\n\n\u201cIt was really a damned-if-you-do, damned-if-you-don\u2019t vote,\u201d Paulson said.\n\nFor Rubio, a Tea Party-backed Republican from Miami who captured just 49 percent of the vote in 2010 to win the U.S. Senate seat, his vote Wednesday marked a gamble with independents. Rubio voted with just 17 other Senate Republicans against the deal to end the government shutdown and raise the nation\u2019s borrowing limit.\n\nRubio said he opposed the deal to reopen the government because it did not include anything to block the implementation of Obamacare.\n\nFlorida Democrats were quick to criticize him for playing to a national Tea Party audience more than mainstream voters in Florida. It was somewhat out of character for state Democrats, who have rarely taken direct shots at Rubio\u2019s votes over the last two years. But state party officials say Wednesday night\u2019s vote was different because of how far Rubio\u2019s position is from most voters in Florida. Public opinion polls have shown voters \u2014 particularly independents \u2014 with middling views on Obamacare, but few supported shutting down the government over it.\n\n\u201cRubio has proven he is more interested in scoring political points with the Tea Party and protecting his potential presidential candidacy than doing what is best for Floridians,\u201d Florida Democratic Party chairwoman Allison Tant said of Rubio, considered to be a potential 2016 presidential candidate.\n\nWhile Rubio\u2019s Senate re-election is still three years off, there are real risks for him in a state that President Barack Obama won twice, Paulson said. Unlike in the Tea Party wave election of 2010, Rubio would be running for re-election during a presidential cycle, when Democratic voters come out in much stronger numbers. Paulson said if voters remember this vote, Democrats could give more Rubio problems than otherwise would have been the case in 2016.\n\nBut voting to reopen the government was not a simple call for Republicans either way. In fact, only six House Republicans in Florida joined with the 10 Florida Democrats in the House to end the shutdown. Overall the House passed the bill to end the shutdown by a 285-144 vote.\n\nAnd the Florida Republicans who voted with Democrats to end the shutdown are taking their lumps.\n\nWithin minutes of Buchanan\u2019s vote, the Manatee County Republican Party posted on its Facebook page that Buchanan was on the wrong side of the vote. That provoked scathing criticism from their followers and calls for a primary challenge.\n\nManatee County Republican Party Chairwoman Kathleen King said she did not authorize the post by an \u201coverzealous volunteer.\u201d The party removed the post nearly 12 hours after it was put up.\n\n\u201cI did not post it and it is not our official position,\u201d King said.\n\nThe conservative group Americans for Limited Government has been even rougher, sending statements statewide vowing to hold Buchanan accountable for allowing Obamacare to be funded.\n\n\u201cWhen it counted, Rep. Buchanan was nowhere to be found in the fight to defund Obamacare,\u201d said Nathan Mehrens, president of the Americans for Limited Government.\n\nThat comment came even though Buchanan voted more than 40 times to defund or delay the Affordable Care Act. Buchanan said on Tuesday that he could not allow the threat of a government default to damage the U.S. economy when it is still trying to rebuild after the recession.\n\nBuchanan was re-elected to a fourth term in the House last year with 53.6 percent of the vote in the 16th Congressional District, which includes all of Sarasota County and most of Manatee.\n\nHe has not faced a serious primary opponent since his first election in 2006, when he narrowly edged now-state Sen. Nancy Detert, R-Venice.\n\nBuchanan knew the attacks would come on the shutdown vote. Even before the vote he said he was ignoring the politics and just trying to focus on what is best for the voters in his district.\n\nPaulson said some of the six who voted for the bill could wind up facing primary challengers, a situation many Republicans had wanted to avoid.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a political mess of their own making,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://politics.heraldtribune.com/files/2013/10/coljwallace18.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}, "description": "Senator criticized for voting no, while representative takes flack for voting yes.", "framework": "Alkivia Framework 0.8"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe3470\"", "article_summary": "That comment came even though Buchanan voted more than 40 times to defund or delay the Affordable Care Act.\nRubio voted with just 17 other Senate Republicans against the deal to end the government shutdown and raise the nation\u2019s borrowing limit.\nBuchanan knew the attacks would come on the shutdown vote.\nIn fact, only six House Republicans in Florida joined with the 10 Florida Democrats in the House to end the shutdown.\nAnd the Florida Republicans who voted with Democrats to end the shutdown are taking their lumps."}
