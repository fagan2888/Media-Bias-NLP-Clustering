That most certainly means he has a campaign book on the market.\n\n\n\nMy copy of Rubio\u2019s American Dreams: Restoring Economic Opportunity for Everyone (Sentinel, $27.95, 212 pages) arrived a few weeks ago. Rubio, in his first term in the U.S. Senate, is also author of the New York Times bestseller An American Son.\n\n\n\nRubio, 43, spent eight years in the Florida House of Representatives, two years as Speaker of the Florida House. He is politically ambitious, perhaps too ambitious. A Cuban American, Rubio has been accused by the press for embellishing his family background by stating his family fled persecution by Fidel Castro when, in fact, his family left Cuba before Castro seized control.\n\n\n\nAs far as campaign books go, Rubio\u2019s American Dreams is slim in several ways. It is a scant seven chapters on safe subjects like, well, the American Dream of opportunity-work-dignity, a good education, retirement security, and family values.\n\n\n\nRubio drops many names. For example, he mentions Nancy Pelosi once saying that she would \u201cnever\u201d reform Social Security. Rubio also gives space to the oft-quoted Pelosi response to the Affordable Care Act, \u201cWe have to pass it to find out what is in it.\u201d\n\n\n\nRubio paraphrases Democratic Senate colleague Massachusetts\u2019 Elizabeth Warren. She said \u201cthe game right now in America is rigged\u201d by the rich and powerful. Rubio says, \u201cIt is the government that is increasingly rigging the game against the working and middle classes.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe author has precious little to say about his likely Democratic presidential opponent, former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, or her missing emails. He seems satisfied to call Mrs. Clinton a \u201cliberal\u201d and repeat one of her verbal gaffes. Why is Rubio holding back? Maybe he will pen another book if he becomes the GOP Presidential candidate.\n\n\n\nMarriage is in need of defense Rubio writes. Rubio waits until page 169 to tell readers \u201cI continue to believe marriage should be defined as one man and one woman.\u201d He states a child needs a mother and a father as his reasoning for supporting marriage inequality.\n\n\n\nRubio writes marriage, between a man and a woman, \u201cshould hold a special status in our laws.\u201d Why? \u201cAt a time when the American family is threatened as never before, redefining it away from the union of one man and one woman only promises to weaken it as a child-rearing, values-conveying institution.\u201d Who or what threatens the family, Rubio does not say.\n\n\n\nIn other words, Rubio believes same-sex families cannot \u201cproperly\u201d rear children and cannot effectively convey values to their children. This raises an important question: With all the same-sex families in Florida and in Washington D.C., why doesn\u2019t Rubio talk to some about child rearing and conveying values? Maybe some same-sex families should visit his Washington office. He\u2019s in Russell 284.\n\n\n\nWhile Rubio doesn\u2019t support marriage equality, he wants to make it clear he does not support discrimination. \u201cI also oppose discrimination, harassment, and violence against anyone because of his or her sexual identity.\u201d That ought to make same-sex couples wanting to marry happy.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe trend that I will not accept \u2026 is the growing attitude that belief in traditional marriage equates to bigotry and hatred,\u201d Rubio writes. He suggests California does this while Florida will not. Has he been to California lately? He needs to see that since Californians expanded marriage to more families, same-sex marriage and straight marriage are now just marriage.\n\n\n\nTraditional has nothing to do with marriage, as it as an institution has been changing for decades due to laws regarding divorce, non-married couples, domestic partners, etc. Has, Rubio, a Catholic, been conditioned to condemn these relationships as well as same-sex relationships?\n\n\n\nRubio\u2019s book contains no mention of his longstanding admiration for late rapper Tupac Shakur. Since 2010 Rubio has been singing Tupac\u2019s praises. The senator told GQ that Tupac's \"Killuminati\" was one of his favorite songs. He also likes \u201cChanges.\u201d I want to hear Rubio\u2019s opinion on Biggie vs. Tupac during the GOP presidential nomination debate. Who knows? Maybe the other Republican presidential candidates, like Lindsey Graham and Dr. Ben Carson, are Tupac fans also.\n\n\n\nIn recent days, Rubio reportedly told supporters, \u201cThe Republican party, for the first time in a long time, has a chance in this election to be the party of the future.\u201d But not the political party with a LGBTQ future unless Rubio evolves on our issues quickly.\n\n\n\nFriends tell me Rubio is more anti-gay than the other 2016 GOP presidential hopefuls. I disagree. I have read some of the upcoming presidential campaign book from Tea Party Texas GOP Senator Ted Cruz. He is not holding back on his anti-LGBTQ views.\n\n\n\nHuman Rights Advocate Jim Patterson is a writer, speaker, and lifelong diplomat for dignity for all people.
