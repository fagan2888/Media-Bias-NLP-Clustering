If so, you probably realized very quickly that no matter how good you were at the game, you never had enough quarters to actually win.\n\nToday, \u201cpatent trolls\u201d are taking this notion to a whole new level. These trolls \u2013 more formally known as \u201cnon-practicing entities\u201d \u2013 can drag you into a game that\u2019s impossible to win, but even worse, you never even wanted to play.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThis legalized extortion racket has drawn the attention of Congress. This week, the Senate Judiciary Committee and Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee both held hearings on patent reform. This is important because patent wars are no longer just a game that big companies play.\n\nPatent trolls and their \u201cslip-and-fall\u201d trial lawyers have created an extortionate business model in which they send out scads of threatening letters to businesses large and small, alleging patent infringement. Simply put, it\u2019s a numbers game of throwing everything against the wall to see what will stick.\n\nThere really is no downside to this model for the patent trolls \u2013 as the law now stands, they have nothing to lose and everything to gain. Most often, the patent trolls don\u2019t even want to go to court. They want the small businesses they sue to pay a licensing fee and not put up a fight. In other words, just give them the rest of the quarters in your pocket.\n\nThe good news is that legislation is now pending in Congress to change the current dynamic, making it more difficult for the trolls to extort legitimate small businesses. I know firsthand that we absolutely cannot let this bill languish.\n\nIn 2013, my three-person company TMSOFT was sued by Lodsys, a privately held \u201cpatent monetizing firm\u201d based in Marshall, Texas. Why? We created an app called White Noise that plays relaxing sounds to help people sleep. It also connects to the Internet, which somehow violated one or more of their patents. They brought patent-infringement lawsuits against numerous other app developers as well, claiming unlicensed usage of Lodsys\u2019 patents.\n\nI discovered my company was being sued when a patent lawyer from Texas emailed offering to defend me in this case. I thought this was clearly a mistake \u2013 why would a troll come after my small company? But as I talked to other business owners, I learned I wasn\u2019t alone. Their most common piece of advice? \u201cJust settle. It\u2019s not worth the fight.\u201d\n\nAlthough the lawsuit was clearly frivolous, I was forced to defend myself and my company in the court system. The patent troll was quick to offer me a way out \u2013 just wire them $3,500 and they would drop the lawsuit. Most companies would take that deal without hesitation and, trust me, I thought about it for days. But I also heard that by settling, companies then open the floodgates for other bottom-feeding patent trolls to come knocking. It\u2019s like signing up to get trolled or stacking your quarters on top of the arcade game.\n\nDan Ravicher from the Public Patent Foundation, a nonprofit organization whose mission is to represent the public\u2019s interest in the patent system, agreed to fight these troll bullies pro bono. Understanding that we were not going to roll over and would fight to the end, Lodsys dismissed its lawsuit. If every frivolous lawsuit came with a free patent attorney, patent trolls wouldn\u2019t exist. But that almost never happens. Ravicher estimated the combined 280 billable hours he and an associate spent on the matter would have cost my company $190,000 \u2013 and that was before we even set foot in court!\n\nIgnoring patent trolls and hoping they\u2019ll go away is not a solution. The patent troll business model is low-risk and high-reward. When they say it\u2019s not about the money, don\u2019t believe it. It\u2019s all about money \u2013 a lot of money! Since the House passed patent reform legislation in 2013, patent trolls have bled more than $100 billion from the U.S. economy \u2013 and they drain another $1.5 billion every week. Small- and medium-sized businesses make up 80 percent of trolls\u2019 targets, including one of every three startups. I guess you could say it\u2019s \u201cGame Over\u201d for small business, because we don\u2019t have enough quarters to keep playing.\n\nThat\u2019s where the Innovation Act, now before Congress, comes in. Introduced by Reps. Bob Goodlatte Bob GoodlatteIRS head vows to finish term despite impeachment push House Republicans press case for impeaching IRS commissioner Saudis scramble for Washington allies MORE (R-Va.) and Peter DeFazio (D-Ore.), and co-sponsored by numerous members of both parties, H.R. 9 would give patent troll victims much-needed relief. Among other things, the bill requires patent owners to do more research before filing suits. As it is now, trolls can threaten to sue without even determining whether the defendant is actually infringing a patent. The bill would also make those who sue, and lose, reimburse the legal fees their targets have incurred defending themselves.\n\nAmerica\u2019s entrepreneurs and small businesses can\u2019t afford to wait any longer for Congress to make patent-infringement lawsuits a fair contest. The Innovation Act changes the game, forcing patent trolls to think twice about targeting small businesses, letting our country\u2019s real innovators get back to building great products that people love. That\u2019s exactly where I want to invest my quarters.\n\nMoore is the founder of TMSoft LLC, a developer of mobile apps and games, and co-host of the Tech 411 podcast.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "It\u2019s a numbers game of throwing everything against the wall to see what will stick.", "description": "It\u2019s a numbers game of throwing everything against the wall to see what will stick.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Congress Blog"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "It\u2019s a numbers game of throwing everything against the wall to see what will stick.", "title": "Why Congress must ensure \u2018game over\u2019 for patent trolls", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/technology/236346-why-congress-must-ensure-game-over-for-patent-trolls", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-02T03:29:10-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-02T03:29-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/technology/236346-why-congress-must-ensure-game-over-for-patent-trolls", "dcterms.date": "2015-03-20T12:00-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Joe Picard", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "author": "Todd Moore", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",Bob Goodlatte,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-20T12:00:03-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-02T03:29:10-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/technology/236346-why-congress-must-ensure-game-over-for-patent-trolls", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "It\u2019s a numbers game of throwing everything against the wall to see what will stick.", "card": "summary", "title": "Why Congress must ensure \u2018game over\u2019 for patent trolls"}, "dcterms.title": "Why Congress must ensure \u2018game over\u2019 for patent trolls"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1865\"", "article_summary": "If every frivolous lawsuit came with a free patent attorney, patent trolls wouldn\u2019t exist.\nBut I also heard that by settling, companies then open the floodgates for other bottom-feeding patent trolls to come knocking.\nSince the House passed patent reform legislation in 2013, patent trolls have bled more than $100 billion from the U.S. economy \u2013 and they drain another $1.5 billion every week.\nThere really is no downside to this model for the patent trolls \u2013 as the law now stands, they have nothing to lose and everything to gain.\nToday, \u201cpatent trolls\u201d are taking this notion to a whole new level."}
