John McCain (R-Ariz.), former White House press secretary Jay Carney continued his stint as a political commentator on CNN by weighing in on the Democrats\u2019 chances in the November midterm elections.\n\nOn \u201cState of the Union\u201d Sunday, Carney said plainly that it won\u2019t be a \u201cgood year\u201d for Democrats running for Congress.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to be a good year for Democrats by definition,\u201d explained Carney. \u201cThe sixth year is always particularly bad for a president\u2019s party.\u201d\n\nMoreover, he suggested that the best outcome that Obama\u2019s party can expect in November is to \u201cbarely\u201d hold onto its majority in the Senate.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no outcome in November that anybody could say would be great for Democrats, except for barely holding onto the Senate,\u201d Carney asserted.\n\nHowever, Carney also said that a positive outcome for Republicans \u2014 that is, winning a majority in the Senate and House of Representatives \u2014 would also have its disadvantages for the GOP.\n\n\u201cThe problem for Republicans, if they win, is Americans begin to think \u2018We hate Congress\u2019 and it\u2019s now clear that one party is in control of Congress,\u201d supposed Carney.\n\nWhether Republicans gain control of the Senate or Democrats maintain their own, Carney admitted that the \u201cterrible gridlock\u201d about which President Obama too often complains will remain in Washington.\n\n\u201cI think either outcome produces terrible gridlock,\u201d stated Carney. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen for the last two years, I think, is record gridlock.\u201d\n\nCarney\u2019s comments come just days after election forecaster Stuart Rothenberg predicted that Republicans will achieve a \u201cnet gain of seven seats\u201d or more in November and hence will overtake the Senate and take control of Congress.\n\nCNN announced last Wednesday that Carney would join the network as a political commentator, and he began his new career fittingly by weighing in on and defending Obama\u2019s speech about his ISIS strategy.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "After enduring a good scolding from Sen.
