Ah, the New Year. It is a time to look forward, contemplate the potential of the future and feel enough remorse about last week’s 5,000-calorie Christmas dinner — and a time to resolve to be healthier.

This year, as you struggle to keep your health-related resolutions, you might get a little help from a surprising place: the Food and Drug Administration.

Many of us are blissfully unaware of the numbers of calories in the foods we eat, particularly when it comes to food purchased at some very popular locations. But our ignorance about much of what we ingest may soon end.

Jollibee, on North King Street in Honolulu, lists calorie counts on its menu, albeit in tiny text.

A provision of the Affordable Care Act that kicks in by November requires chain restaurants, vending machines, and many food establishments to post the number of calories in their food for everyone to see. It’s all intended to assist us in making better and healthier dietary choices.

Sometimes such efforts bear fruit, and sometimes they don’t. When Michael Bloomberg was mayor of New York City, he successfully forced through a ban on large sizes of sugary sodas, which affected portions over 16 ounces. Although drinking sodas daily has been proven to increase the risk for diabetes, the beverage industry weighed in against such regulation of their products via a legal fight.

Critics of the ban argued that New York’s Department of Health didn’t possess the power to engage in such a “nanny state” response. (Some mockingly suggested that the department might similarly intervene to force people to get more rest in the city that, famously, “never sleeps.”)
