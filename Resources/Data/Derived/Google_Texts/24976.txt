"Business owners, with the employee mandate delayed, are little concerned with the Affordable Care Act in mass, except for the business owners who insured themselves and their family in the personal market," said Barry Sloane, Chairman, President and CEO of The Small Business Authority. "The overall health of the economy was more of a concern. It will be interesting to see the results of this poll if we run it again in July, when many business owners may have their current policies cancelled as the employee mandate approaches and the Affordable Care Act affects "substandard" pre-existing small group policies."
