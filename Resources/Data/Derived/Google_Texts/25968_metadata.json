This is an extremely conservative district. All we\u2019re getting is the same Pablum.\u201d\n\nDonnelly was critical of Cook\u2019s vote for the Omnibus Bill continuing amnesty, support for the United Nations, Obamacare, climate change and immigration of 300,000 refuges from the Middle East, he says. Donnelly estimates 10-13 percent of Muslims agree with ISIS and Jihad.\n\n\u201cJihad is the right to murder those with whom you do not agree,\u201d he says. \u201cThey could be declaring allegiance to ISIS in their Facebook page and the government doesn\u2019t even know about it. They don\u2019t know jack.\u201d\n\nCook and others have not done anything to remedy the situation, even after the Dec. 2 San Bernardino terrorist attack, Donnelly says.\n\n\u201cYou know, there is a time and place for shutting down the government. For me this is about someone who does not represent us and is putting us at risk,\u201d he warns. \u201cYou know what, I would rather be a John the Baptist and just be one, but still be a John the Baptist. And he had his head cut off by the government.\u201d\n\nAlthough he is running for a spot in the federal government, Donnelly wants to get rid of most of it.\n\n\u201cI want to abolish the IRS (Internal Revenue Service),\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m for a flatter tax.\u201d\n\nAs for medical care, Donnelly supports a \u201ccash system.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can give indigents $10,000 a year for their medical care and let the marketplace set the price.\u201d\n\nAnd replacing the federal government with local control at all levels would improve our lives, he believes.\n\nDonnelly is a talk show host, and displays that kind of passion about what he believes.\n\nHis next major appearance will be for his 50th birthday on May 9 at a barbecue at the National Orange Show. He calls it \u201c$50 for 50,\u201d and will charge $50 for two people for the event.\n\nFor more information, visit donnellyforcongress.com or call (760) 933-8460.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "news_keywords": "tim donnelly,political", "og": {"site_name": "Highland Community News", "description": "Three Democrats and one Republican are seeking to unseat Eighth Congressional District Congressman Paul Cook, the Republican currently serving Highland and the mountains and desert southeast sections of California.", "title": "Tim Donnelly visits", "url": "http://www.highlandnews.net/news/political/tim-donnelly-visits/article_1e166ab2-0daf-11e6-9902-4f9b4295a55a.html", "image": {"width": 597, "identifier": "http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/highlandnews.net/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/4/10/410070cc-0daf-11e6-af7a-3bf9b767582e/5722c232ee751.image.jpg?resize=597%2C630", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@HighlandNews1", "card": "summary", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 628407200528933}, "keywords": "tim donnelly,political", "google-site-verification": "PNVjiZl0_Y5IbUCRYJUmgyfwIkXdPrrjJMBcQOSaMvk", "description": "Three Democrats and one Republican are seeking to unseat Eighth Congressional District Congressman Paul Cook, the Republican currently serving Highland and the mountains and desert southeast sections of California."}, "article_summary": "He calls it \u201c$50 for 50,\u201d and will charge $50 for two people for the event.\nThree Democrats and one Republican are seeking to unseat Eighth Congressional District Congressman Paul Cook, the Republican currently serving Highland and the mountains and desert southeast sections of California.\nThe lone Republican challenging Cook is former Assemblyman, former gubernatorial candidate, and Tea Party favorite Tim Donnelly.\n\u201cYou know what, I would rather be a John the Baptist and just be one, but still be a John the Baptist.\n\u201cThey could be declaring allegiance to ISIS in their Facebook page and the government doesn\u2019t even know about it."}
