Sturges\n\nAug. 28 \u2014 A complaint filed with the Internal Revenue Service Aug. 25 charges Jackson Health System, a public hospital system operating in Dade County, Fla., with failing to comply with charity care obligations under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe health system, according to the administrative action initiated by the National Health Law Program (NHeLP) and Florida Legal Services (FLS), has neglected its obligations under Internal Revenue Code \u00a7501(r), which requires most tax-exempt hospitals to take actions to better serve their communities; revise and publicize their financial assistance policies; and reform their billing and collection practices to ensure that the poor and uninsured have access to the health-care services they need.\n\nThe complaint, the first filed with the IRS by advocacy organizations representing low-income people, specifically alleges that Jackson is violating ACA requirements governing nonprofit hospitals' billing and collection policies for low-income patients. Other nonprofit hospitals across the country and in Miami have posted their financial assistance policies on their websites and engaged community representatives in conducting community health needs assessments (CHNAs), yet Jackson has failed to do so, the complaint alleged.\n\nHospital spokeswoman Lidia Amoretty, who declined to comment directly on the complaint, forwarded an Aug. 26 letter from the hospital's president, Carlos A. Migoya, to the Public Health Trust Board of Trustees, which oversees the hospital's operations. That correspondence said the hospital believes it is meeting its charity care and community outreach obligations.\n\nAttorneys who spoke to Bloomberg BNA Aug. 28 said the complaint may focus public attention on perceived inequities of the health system's financial assistance, billing, collection and community outreach and support practices. For several reasons, however, the complaint isn't likely to result in action by the IRS, they predicted, because there are uncertainties concerning whether Jackson, as a governmental or public hospital operator, is subject to the ACA provisions.\n\nRefusal to Expand Medicaid\n\nSarah Somers, managing attorney at NHeLP, said the complaint is designed to focus the IRS's attention on Jackson's lack of compliance with 501(r) provisions designed to ensure all citizens have access to the care they need, regardless of ability to pay.\n\nAttorneys tell Bloomberg BNA the complaint isn't likely to result in action by the IRS because there are uncertainties concerning whether Jackson, as a governmental or public hospital operator, is even subject to the ACA provisions.\n\n\u201cCongress took a much-needed step to ensure that people are aware of these financial assistance programs and that they are not deterred from seeking that care because of unreasonable billing practices,\u201d Somers said in an Aug. 27 statement. \u201cThese new requirements help advance the ACA's goal that all citizens and lawful residents have access to affordable health care, and those requirements must be enforced.\u201d\n\nThe complaint claims that many low-income Miami-Dade County residents who receive care at Jackson \u201care completely unaware of the financial assistance program until they seek legal assistance for medical debt from their treatment.\u201d As a result, county residents who would otherwise qualify for free or reduced-cost care under the hospital's financial assistance program have been subjected to collection actions for the medically necessary services they received.\n\nThe complaint also says that, because of the hospital's alleged violations, \u201cmany of these uninsured patients will likely continue to believe that they cannot receive services and may either forgo necessary medical care to avoid medical debt or be subjected to billing practices that violate the ACA.\u201d\n\nMiriam Harmatz, a senior health law attorney with FLS, said her organization appreciates that Jackson provides a critical function as a safety net and has limited resources. Nevertheless, \u201cit needs to ensure that people who are eligible for this county-funded care can actually get it,\u201d she said.\n\nShe noted that \u201cvirtually all of the low-income uninsured county residents who are experiencing difficulties with the hospital would be eligible for Medicaid\u2014with virtually all of the cost covered by the federal government\u2014if the Florida Legislature would just accept federal funding.\u201d\n\nAccording to the complaint, more than 165,000 individuals who would have been eligible for Medicaid coverage under the ACA are in the \u201ccoverage gap\u201d\u2014too much income to be eligible for Medicaid but too little to qualify for subsidized health insurance\u2014because of the state's decision not to expand Medicaid.\n\nThe hospital letter, however, lamented the groups' filing, saying the complaint was filed \u201cdespite ongoing conversations between our agencies about addressing some of their concerns.\u201d It noted that Jackson provided $365 million in charity care during FY 2013-14, reflecting approximately 212,000 primary care, specialist and emergency room clinical encounters that weren't billed to patients.\n\n\u201cJackson's mission promises a single high standard of quality care,\u201d the letter said. \u201cWe have consistently acted to protect and enhance that legacy. Rest assured we will continue working with civic leaders and community stakeholders to ensure Jackson's charity-care program lives up to our collective expectations.\u201d\n\nComplaint Flawed?\n\nGerald M. Griffith, Jones Day, Chicago, said the complaint may bring some attention to the groups' concerns, but it might not result in an official IRS investigation or enforcement action. \u201cEven if it does, we may never hear about it,\u201d he said.\n\nHe noted that, although there is no private right of action to enforce Section 501(r) or any other part of the Internal Revenue Code, that isn't what is going on in this case.\n\n\u201cPrivate parties can be tax law whistle-blowers, but the government decides whether or not to prosecute the case,\u201d he said. \u201cThe IRS has a couple of routes for doing this and the one these groups are using, Form 13909, has been around for several years.\u201d\n\nGriffith said that the IRS considers complaints but typically doesn't publicize specific actions on them due to the protected nature of taxpayer information. \u201cIt's up to the IRS to sort out whether there is a problem,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAlso, Section 501(r) only applies to 501(c)(3) hospitals, which include dual status hospitals\u2014public or government-run hospitals that have obtained 501(c)(3) status in addition to their existing exemption as a governmental entity,\u201d he said. \u201cIf Jackson Health is a public hospital that has not been recognized as a 501(c)(3) organization, then Section 501(r) does not apply,\u201d Griffith said.\n\n\u201cThe bigger potential impact may be in a public relations battle or in any attention the situation may garner in Congress,\u201d he said.\n\nHarmatz, however, disputed the notion that public hospitals aren't required to comply with Section 501(r) directives. \u201cIt is, at best, an open question given that final 501(r) regulations have not been issued and that comments on the IRS's proposals have explained that the ACA supports holding public hospitals to the same charity care and community engagement standards as other exempt hospitals,\u201d she said.\n\nShe noted that other public hospitals have prepared and posted CHNAs and have adopted and publicized financial assistance policies. Moreover, \u201cJackson Health has at no time in the ongoing discussions we have had with it suggested that the ACA's requirements related to tax exempt hospitals do not apply to its operations,\u201d Harmatz added.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Peyton M.
