Three lawsuits have made it to U.S. Circuit Courts, just one step from the Supreme Court, arguing that the text of the Affordable Care Act allows premium subsidies for state-run exchanges only. (RELATED: Second Court Strikes Down Obamacare Subsidies In Federal Exchanges)\n\nThe report was sponsored by HHS\u2019s Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, which, among other duties, compiles the enrollment statistics each month during open enrollment for Obamacare exchanges. Given the ongoing controversy over Obamacare subsidies, HHS sponsoring the study could be a sign that the administration is beginning to worry about its prospects.\n\nThe administration\u2019s motivations aside, the key finding from the report belies HHS\u2019s pro-Obamacare position. Eliminating premium subsidies entirely would \u201ccause large declines in enrollment and substantial increases in premiums,\u201d RAND Health concluded. In short \u2014 Americans are far less likely to want Obamacare coverage, or to be able to afford it, when taxpayers aren\u2019t footing the bill.\n\n\u201cIn scenarios in which the tax credits are eliminated, our model predicts a near \u2018death spiral,\u2019 with very sharp premium increases and drastic declines in individual market enrollment,\u201d the study concluded.\n\nObamacare supporters will tout that well-intentioned premium subsidies are working. But if the health-care law can\u2019t survive without taxpayers supporting Obamacare enrollees, the point remains that the Affordable Care Act is failing in its promise to control the actual cost of health care and health insurance.\n\nRAND found that without the ACA\u2019s subsidies, the cost of premiums will rise by 43.3 percent and Obamacare enrollment will fall by a whopping 68 percent. That would mean 11.3 million more Americans would be uninsured.\n\n\u201cLow-risk individuals of any age may need a tax credit to incentivize them to sign up,\u201d the study concluded, in what may seem common sense to the health-care law\u2019s conservative opposition. \u201cAs a result, premium tax credits encourage the enrollment of low-risk individuals, who improve the risk pool and bring down premiums.\u201d\n\nIn short, if someone doesn\u2019t feel they need pricey health insurance, the study found, they probably won\u2019t buy it \u2014 unless there are hefty taxpayer subsidies lowering their bottom line, or an individual mandate issuing a significant penalty on those who fail to sign up for coverage.\n\nIf the individual mandate forcing people to purchase coverage, instead of subsidies, falls by the wayside, the number of people who purchase individual health insurance outside the exchange would fall by over 20 percent \u2014 causing premiums for those that remain to increase by 7 percent. If the mandate were overturned, 8.2 million Americans wouldn\u2019t be purchasing health insurance, RAND found.\n\nThe study also discovered that apart from premium subsidies and the individual mandate, the presence of young adults also plays a role in keeping the cost of exchange coverage down. For every 1 percentage point reduction in the share of young adult enrollees in the individual market, RAND expects a 0.44 percent increase in premiums.\n\nAfter the first open enrollment period, the administration is 11 percent behind its goal of 39 percent of Obamacare enrollees nationally qualifying as \u2018young invincibles\u2019 (although that may have fallen since 700,000 people dropped their Obamacare coverage over the last six months). That would make exchange premiums 4.84 percent higher on average today than they would have been had the administration attracted the level of interest from young adults they had anticipated.\n\nAs implemented so far, Obamacare\u2019s made many changes to the health insurance market. The individual mandate, for one, has been upheld by the highest courts, but taxpayer subsidies in federally-run exchanges \u2014 which accounts for over 5 million out of 7.3 million enrollees \u2014 are still facing serious legal challenges. If the Obama administration fails to uphold its position, it could put the exchanges in an extremely precarious position.\n\nFollow Sarah on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Sarah Hurtubise", "description": "If this one thing happens", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "The Obama administration has funded a new study by top consulting firm RAND Health that startlingly finds that if taxpayer subsidies are eliminated, Obamacare exchanges will fall into a \"death spiral.", "title": "HHS-Funded Study: Obamacare Will Suffer \u2018Death Spiral\u2019 If Subsidies Fail", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/10/21/hhs-funded-study-obamacare-will-suffer-death-spiral-if-subsidies-fail/", "image": {"width": 630, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/witless_shrugged-e1331500273180.jpg", "height": 270}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "If this one thing happens", "title": "HHS-Funded Study: Obamacare Will Suffer \u2018Death Spiral\u2019 If Subsidies Fail Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/10/21/hhs-funded-study-obamacare-will-suffer-death-spiral-if-subsidies-fail/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/witless_shrugged-e1331500273180.jpg"}, "creator": "@@SarahMHurtubise", "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-10-21 00:02:48", "sailthru.title": "HHS-Funded Study: Obamacare Will Suffer 'Death Spiral' If Subsidies Fail", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "sailthru.tags": "barack-obama,department-of-health-and-human-services,obamacare,sarah-hurtubise", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "keywords": "barack obama,department of health and human services,obamacare", "sailthru.description": "The Obama administration has funded a new study by top consulting firm RAND Health that startlingly finds that if taxpayer subsidies are eliminated, Obamacare exchanges will fall into a \"death spiral.", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/witless_shrugged-e1331500273180.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Given the ongoing controversy over Obamacare subsidies, HHS sponsoring the study could be a sign that the administration is beginning to worry about its prospects.\nCircuit Courts, just one step from the Supreme Court, arguing that the text of the Affordable Care Act allows premium subsidies for state-run exchanges only.\nObamacare supporters will tout that well-intentioned premium subsidies are working.\nRAND found that without the ACA\u2019s subsidies, the cost of premiums will rise by 43.3 percent and Obamacare enrollment will fall by a whopping 68 percent.\nEliminating premium subsidies entirely would \u201ccause large declines in enrollment and substantial increases in premiums,\u201d RAND Health concluded."}
