John Thune (R-S.D.), CNN.com opinion article, Jan. 6, 2015\n\nThe push to repeal the medical device tax already has bipartisan support, and it is expected to be one of the first issues taken up by Congress this year. The repeal of the 2.3 percent excise tax, imposed under the Affordable Care Act, is one of the priorities of the Republican-led Congress as lawmakers aim to chip away at parts of the health-care law.\n\nWe don\u2019t intend to single out Thune. He is among a chorus of lawmakers \u2014 Democrat and Republican \u2014 who want to repeal the tax, and among many who are using the job-loss claim as one of the reasons to get rid of it. Sens. Al Franken (D-Minn.) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) have spoken against the tax since 2009, saying jobs would be threatened. Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) is a long-time critic of the tax and will push for a permanent repeal through the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee.\n\nRep. Charlie Dent (R-Pa.), in an interview about GOP legislative priorities, said \u201c33,000 jobs have been affected or lost as a result\u201d of the tax. Rep. Erik Paulsen (R-Minn.) also penned an editorial in the Wall Street Journal that the tax \u201chas already cost as many as 33,000 American jobs.\u201d\n\nHave thousands of jobs in the American medical device industry been eliminated as a result of the tax?\n\nThe Facts\n\nThe claim of massive job losses is one of the main arguments for the repeal. The tax is imposed on a variety of medical devices, including MRI machines and pacemakers, but does not include consumer retail items such as contact lenses or eyeglasses. The tax, which took effect January 2013, is projected to generate $29 billion over 10 years in net revenues. The effective tax rate is about 1.5 percent, because businesses can deduct it from their federal taxes.\n\nCritics also say the tax is forcing jobs overseas and is stunting innovation in the medical device industry. The Fact Checker examined the latter two claims in a previous article which resulted in a ruling of Two Pinocchios.\n\nLawmakers frequently cite a survey by the trade group Advanced Medical Technology Association, or AdvaMed, to show the negative impact of the tax. Thune was citing broad industry studies, including the AdvaMed report, rather than cherry-picking specific companies, Thune\u2019s spokeswoman AshLee Strong said. From November to December 2013, 38 large and small companies responded to the electronic survey that they have cut jobs and forgone hiring as a result of the tax. The total impact on industry employment, the survey found, was 33,000 jobs \u2014 14,000 actual job losses and \u201cforgone hiring\u201d of 19,000 workers.\n\nAdvaMed says the survey was sent to every member of the organization, and its 2013 annual report says it has nearly 300 members. So that\u2019s a pretty poor response rate. For all we know, the other 250+ companies added jobs and saw no reason to respond to the survey. The survey certainly does not tell you much about the impact of the medical device tax on the entire industry, let alone AdvaMed\u2019s membership.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a perfectly credible research methodology,\u201d said David Nexon, AdvaMed\u2019s head of domestic policy, though he said there \u201cconceivably\u201d could have been some bias since not everyone responded. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say the number we came up with is necessarily 100 percent on the nose, but it\u2019s pretty clear that there are substantial job losses connected with the tax,\u201d he said \u2014 whether it\u2019s 33,000, 40,000 or 28,000.\n\nStrong also noted a 2012 report by the right-leaning American Action Forum, saying it portrays the \u201cdamage caused to the vast majority of U.S. medical device companies that are not publicly traded.\u201d But that report is rather dated \u2014 it simply offered a prediction that 14,500 jobs \u201cwill be lost.\u201d It did not tally the actual impact of the tax.\n\nSome companies certainly have announced layoffs since 2012, ranging from dozens of employees to 1,000-plus jobs. Not all announcements attributed the cuts to the tax (or anticipation of the tax), but some did. Many of the announcements were made from early-2012 to mid-2013. Here is a sample:\n\nAbbott Laboratories laid off 450 employees from its Temecula plant, and continued the layoffs through late 2014 as a part of a restructuring and realignment plan announced in 2012. Employees could apply for other vacant positions in the company.\n\nMedtronic announced it would eliminate 1,000 jobs, mostly in the heart rhythm device unit. But company officials also said they plan to hire 1,500 workers over an 11-month period. After all the changes, overall employment in the United States was expected to be \u201cflat to slightly up.\u201d\n\nBoston Scientific officials said the medical device tax \u201cplayed a role\u201d in the company\u2019s decision to cut up to 1,000 jobs, or 10 percent of its workforce.\n\nLawmakers also cite anecdotes of local manufacturers blaming the tax for creating harm to their companies. Shawn Millan, communications director for Dent, e-mailed to The Fact Checker: \u201cEverything that Congressman Dent has heard from his local manufacturers indicates the tax is damaging to their ability to maintain or potentially expand their workforces, their facilities and their research and product development efforts. The fact that the tax is harmful to manufacturers across the country is why its repeal enjoys broad bipartisan and geographical support.\u201d\n\nDrew Griffin, Paulsen\u2019s press secretary, wrote to The Fact Checker: \u201cCongressman Paulsen has traveled the country talking to these businesses, and he continues to hear from them that they are stopping projects, laying off workers, or having to borrow money because of the tax.\u201d\n\nDespite cuts to some companies, there was growth in others in 2013, including smaller companies, according to a report by EP Vantage, the editorial arm of health-care research and analysis group EvaluateMedTech. Five of the companies in the report\u2019s top 10 head-count increases by percentage of staff worldwide were companies headquartered in the United States and have fewer than 600 employees.\n\nNot all small companies or start-ups are yet feeling the pressure to cut jobs. A spokesperson for Innovative Trauma Care, a San Antonio start-up that makes emergency clamps that control bleeding before the surgery, said the company is so new that the impact of the tax has been minimal. Frank Fischer, chief executive of NeuroPace, a privately held California company of 120 employees, said the tax hasn\u2019t had any impact on his employee base because the company is just beginning to commercialize devices to treat neurological disorders. But Fischer said he anticipates forgone hires as the company grows.\n\nA January 2014 survey of 1,203 senior managers at U.S. medical device companies by Emergo Group, a medical device industry consulting firm, found 8.7 percent of respondents confirmed they reduced staff or employee headcounts in 2013 to lower costs. That was on a par with the 8.4 percent of respondents who had said the previous year that they planned to reduce headcount.\n\nEmergo also found the impact of the tax was not as severe as predicted. Fifty percent of respondents in 2014 said they did not make any significant changes in response to the tax.\n\n\n\n(Emergo Group Global Medical Device Industry Outlook for 2014)\n\nAgain, let\u2019s note that this was based on the results of responses from more than 1,200 senior managers. That certainly appears more credible than a survey of just 38 companies.\n\n[Update: Emergo will publish final results of the most recent survey late January 2015, but some preliminary numbers have been made available. Of nearly 900 senior managers of U.S. medical-device tax companies who responded, 42.6 percent said they did not make any significant changes in 2014 in response to the medical device tax. About 10 percent said they reduced staff or employee head count to lower costs in 2014.]\n\nThe Congressional Research Service also found the medical-device tax would have \u201cfairly minor effects\u201d on industry jobs, and that output and employment in the industry would fall by \u201cno more than two-tenths of 1 percent.\u201d (AdvaMed criticized the CRS analysis as \u201cfundamentally flawed.\u201d)\n\nMedtronic said in a statement: \u201cThe device tax is one of the many business pressures we must account for in our planning. The reality is that the medical device tax takes funding away from other areas where we could invest. Medtronic has always stated that we believe that the medical device tax is a regressive tax, and we believe it discourages innovation.\u201d\n\nWhile many companies cited the tax as a contributor to layoffs, there is no evidence it was the sole factor. The medical device industry has faced many regulatory and technology changes in recent years that have made the industry\u2019s future volatile.\n\nThe industry, for the most part, remains stable despite various challenges. This is especially true for the largest publicly traded companies in the United States, according to the National Center for Health Research. The center\u2019s analysis found profit margins reported by the companies remained stable over the past 10 years. (Clarification: This was different from stock prices, which increased dramatically during that time, the center found.)\n\nNexon, the AdvaMed executive, acknowledged there are many factors that contribute to companies\u2019 staffing decisions. But he said the companies\u2019 answers to AdvaMed\u2019s survey were telling that staffing cuts were attributable in some part to the tax, because it is an additional payment they have to take into account. Head count is an \u201cobvious place\u201d that companies are going to look to cut, Nexon said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to attribute everything to the tax because there\u2019s a lot going on in the industry besides the tax,\u201d Nexon said. \u201cThere are a lot of things that are going on that are harder to address but this one should be easy. It just takes an act of Congress to get rid of it.\u201d\n\nThe Pinocchio Test\n\nThe public is not privy to the companies\u2019 individual business decisions, so it is difficult to prove or disprove the exact impact of the tax on their personnel matters. Based on self-reported announcements and survey answers by small and large companies, there were indeed some jobs that were cut at least partly due to the tax or the anticipation of its impact. The tax is not helping the industry, but neither is it single-handedly destroying thousands of jobs. Indeed, one survey of senior managers found that the impact was less than expected.\n\nWhat we have here is a bipartisan failure, with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle rushing to declare the tax is killing jobs. The evidence for that is pretty skimpy, unless one just wants to pick and choose a few companies. At the very least, citing a single (and relatively small) tax as the sole reason for current and future job cuts in the volatile industry is a misrepresentation.\n\nTwo Pinocchios\n\n\n\n\n\n(About our rating scale)\n\nSend us facts to check by filling out this form\n\nFollow The Fact Checker on Twitter and friend us on Facebook", "article_metadata": {"description": "Lawmakers looking to repeal the medical device tax say it has led to thousands of layoffs, and it threatens thousands more jobs.
