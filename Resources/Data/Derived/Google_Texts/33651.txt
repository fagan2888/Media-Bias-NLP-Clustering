As the population ages and the costs of entering and living in a continuing care retirement community (CCRC) or an assisted living facility (ALF) continue to rise, families are looking for alternative living arrangements for their loved ones. One alternative is ‘the granny pod‘ or ‘MedCottage.’ In general, these tiny houses are comprised of a bedroom, bathroom, kitchen area and living space. The pod is meant to reside in the backyard of an existing residential location and be a safe living area for an aging family member. So, instead of families looking to buy a bigger home or to construct a large addition to accommodate their family member, the pod gives everyone the space they need. Arguably, the cost is less than several months at an assisted living facility or the entry fee for a CCRC (depending on location). Of course, one cannot simply move a pod into the backyard without first ensuring compliance with zoning ordinances, permit requirements for construction and hooking up utilities, insurance coverage and an overall fit for the family lifestyle and the care needs, among other considerations. However, the idea is unique and innovative and may relieve a lot of stress and avoid family arguments during what may already be difficult times.
