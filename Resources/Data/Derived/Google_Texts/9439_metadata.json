It is a painfully obvious sentence, and yet it bears repeating because we\u2019re so fixated on women\u2019s prenatal and preconception behavior and health. For example, the most emailed article on the New York Times website as I type is about how women\u2019s eating habits affect their babies in the womb. But we barely ever mention how male behavior can affect sperm quality.\n\nThe paper, called \u201cMore and Less Than Equal: How Men Factor in the Reproductive Equation,\u201d notes that since 2004, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended that people of both genders who are looking to have a baby monitor their health more closely\u2014but in practice, this recommendation is generally directed toward women, who are now advised to treat their pregnancies as 12 months long. This means curtailing alcohol consumption and taking prenatal vitamins before they\u2019ve even conceived.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nYet recent research has shown that men\u2019s preconception behavior also matters. According to the CDC, tobacco and heavy drinking can damage sperm DNA, and we\u2019re just starting to understand how older men\u2019s sperm may affect their offspring adversely. The only venue where male preconception health gets much attention, the authors point out, is at the sperm bank, where men\u2019s sperm is scrutinized in a way it\u2019s not elsewhere.\n\nThe study\u2019s authors, Yale\u2019s Rene Almeling and Princeton\u2019s Miranda Waggoner, argue that the hyperfocus on women\u2019s bodies before and during reproduction has led to a dearth of research about men\u2019s contributions to conception. So there should be more research about men\u2019s preconception behaviors, but on a more individual level, doctors should also be asking their male patients if they are planning on having children, just the way that women are asked at their yearly gynecological visits. On the policy level, Almeling and Waggoner suggest that the Affordable Care Act might cover men\u2019s preconception visits, as all women\u2019s preconception visits are now covered without copay.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.tags": "men reproductive health, male pre-conception behaviors, men trying to get pregnant, healthy sperm, alcohol sperm, coffee sperm, men fertility, More and Less than Equal: How Men Factor in the Reproductive Equation, gender and society, new paper men reproductive, Rene Almeling, Miranda Waggoner", "sailthru.author": "Jessica Grose", "description": "\u201cMen and women contribute equally to reproduction.\u201d That\u2019s a statement in a new paper in the journal Gender and Society about how men\u2019s role in making  ...", "og": {"site_name": "Slate Magazine", "description": "\u201cMen and women contribute equally to reproduction.\u201d That\u2019s a statement in a new paper in the journal Gender and Society about how men\u2019s role in making  ...", "title": "Women Modify Behavior When Trying to Get Pregnant.
