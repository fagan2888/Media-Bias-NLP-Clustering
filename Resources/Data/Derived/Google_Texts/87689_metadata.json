All of these bills died in the Democrat controlled Senate. In the last election, GOP numbers in the House increased and the Republicans took the Senate, so we know the Obamacare wars are about to heat up even more.\n\nAs has been pointed out in these pages, Obamacare contains funding mechanisms for the Indian Health Service that simply would not be possible in the time of budget sequestration without Obamacare. Indians have many more reasons to ride to the sound of the guns in this political battle.\n\nIndividual Indians who are enrolled or otherwise eligible for Indian Health Service but who live outside an IHS service area, like myself, as well as Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act Corporation shareholders, have special status in Obamacare as individuals.\n\nEnrolled Indians and Alaska Natives can purchase private insurance coverage off the Obamacare exchanges at any time, rather than having to wait for the annual enrollment period.\n\nYou may also change plans from one month to the next, although that must be done carefully to avoid gaps in coverage.\n\nEnrolled Indians and Alaska Natives who make less than around $70,650 for a family of four ($88,320 in Alaska)\u2014and that\u2019s many of us\u2014can enroll in a zero cost sharing plan, which means no deductibles or copayments or coinsurance required.\n\nIf your income is above those limits and you currently are served by Indian Health Service, you can enroll in a limited cost sharing plan, which means you pay nothing out of pocket at IHS or any other provider when you have a referral from an IHS doctor.\n\nIf you have access now, you may choose to keep getting services from Indian Health Service.\n\nEnrolled Indians and Alaska Natives who use Medicaid and Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) have no premiums, enrollment fees, or out of pocket costs.\n\nPersons who are eligible for Indian Health Service are exempt from the \u201cShared Responsibility Payment,\u201d also known as the penalty for failure to purchase health insurance.\n\nTo qualify for these benefits, you need a tribal membership card or a Certificate of Degree of Indian Blood from the BIA or a document from an ANCSA Corporation showing shareholder status.\n\nThere are at least two reasons to buy insurance off the exchange if you can afford it even if IHS is your primary provider. One is that the policies available on the exchanges cover more services than IHS can cover, and the other is that your IHS clinic can bill the insurance company for your care, opening another income source in addition to the federal government and helping provide services for other Indians.\n\nThe Healthcare.gov website, reputed to be working well now after the first year debacle, has information directed specifically for Indians and Alaska Natives. The political fight to keep Obamacare working is about to heat up, but as long as it is working, there will be advantages for Indians and Alaska Natives both as individuals and as clients of the Indian Health Service.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Affordable Care Act has been fully repealed six times and crippled 54 times in legislation passed by the Republican controlled House of Reps.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "leeanne", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/12/11/enrolled-natives-and-obamacare-158250", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/liz-derouen-indian-health-obamacare.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Enrolled Natives and Obamacare"}, "abstract": "The Affordable Care Act has been fully repealed six times and crippled 54 times in legislation passed by the Republican controlled House of Reps.", "dc": {"title": "Enrolled Natives and Obamacare"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/12/11/enrolled-natives-and-obamacare-158250", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Steve Russell, Obamacare, Affordable Care Act, Native Health and Wellness, Native Health Care, Indian Health Service", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 1}, "dcterms.date": "2014-12-11T15:15-05:00", "dcterms.title": "Enrolled Natives and Obamacare"}, "article_summary": "Enrolled Indians and Alaska Natives can purchase private insurance coverage off the Obamacare exchanges at any time, rather than having to wait for the annual enrollment period.\nEnrolled Indians and Alaska Natives who use Medicaid and Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) have no premiums, enrollment fees, or out of pocket costs.\nAs has been pointed out in these pages, Obamacare contains funding mechanisms for the Indian Health Service that simply would not be possible in the time of budget sequestration without Obamacare.\nThe Healthcare.gov website, reputed to be working well now after the first year debacle, has information directed specifically for Indians and Alaska Natives.\nIf you have access now, you may choose to keep getting services from Indian Health Service."}
