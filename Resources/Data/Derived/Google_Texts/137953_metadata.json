His lone connection to football involved watching the Seattle Seahawks on television.\n\nZack Bailey, now a 6-6, 320-pound freshman offensive lineman at South Carolina, looks back and hardly recognizes his former self.\n\n\u201cSometimes I think about it, and I question how I really got here,\u201d said the Summerville High School graduate. \u201cI look at the achievements that I\u2019ve made, and I just hope to make more along the way.\u201d\n\nOf the four freshmen and one transfer who comprise USC\u2019s newest class of offensive linemen, the most unlikely member might be Bailey, who had zero interest in football growing up in Seattle. He played one year of Pop Warner as a 5-year-old. \u201cHated it,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t like it at all. So I never went back to it.\u201d\n\nIf he played any sports at all, they were through a video game controller. But his parents, Boeing employees who grew weary of the rainy Northwest, moved to the Lowcountry when Bailey was in eighth grade. Walking the hallways of DuBose Middle School at 6-3 and 260 pounds, Bailey couldn\u2019t help but stand out. Principal Kenny Farrell, also a Green Wave assistant, asked if he\u2019d come out for the football team.\n\nBailey said he\u2019d try it for one day. \u201cA day led to two days, two days led to a season,\u201d Bailey said Sunday, when USC held its annual Media Day. \u201cWe ended up going undefeated, and I just fell in love with it after that.\u201d\n\nAnd now Bailey, who played in the Shrine Bowl and was a finalist for South Carolina\u2019s Mr. Football award last year, is part of a prized class of linemen poised to carry USC into the future. Christian Pellage, a 6-6, 314-pound tackle from Brooksville, Fla., was the Gamecocks\u2019 highest-rated signee in ESPN\u2019s top 300 list, while Bailey was USC\u2019s third-highest-rated addition. Tackle Blake Camper of Virginia Beach, Va., guard Trey Derouen of Lilburn, Ga., and junior center Cory Helms, a transfer from Wake Forest, round out the class.\n\nHelms must sit out this season under NCAA transfer rules, but the group is already making its presence felt. \u201cThey\u2019re the best group of young guys I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d said junior guard Cody Waldrop. \u201cThey know all their plays, they\u2019ve worked at it all summer, and they\u2019re doing very well.\u201d\n\nOffensive line coach Shawn Elliott said he\u2019s pleased with everything the newcomers have done, \u201cmore so than in the previous six years I\u2019ve been here.\u201d The five of them are \u201calmost inseparable. You see one of them, you see them all,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cThey trust in each other, they talk to each other. Sometimes you get offensive linemen, they come from different parts of the world, they don\u2019t gel quite as quickly, so one doesn\u2019t quite speak up to the next. But these guys, they\u2019re like brothers for some reason. That\u2019s how they are.\u201d\n\nThat much is evident by their living arrangements. Bailey said he lives with the other three freshmen in one dorm, while Helms is in another. But \u201cCory doesn\u2019t ever leave our room,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s like we\u2019re all five in one room. We talk to each other every single night, we hang out every single night. It\u2019s like we\u2019re family. It\u2019s like we\u2019ve known each other forever now.\u201d\n\nBailey moved to South Carolina during one of the hottest summers on record, a jarring experience coming from the temperate Northwest. \u201cIt was awful. We went to take my dog out, and my dog came right back in,\u201d he said. But the heat also trimmed his body, and crafted a football player different from the one who had quit in Pop Warner. \u201cI was big, but I was fat,\u201d he said of that time.\n\nNo more. He rapidly emerged as a force on the football field, something he truly realized when Summerville coaches taught him how to pull as a sophomore. First time he tried it, \u201cI leveled a kid,\u201d Bailey said. \u201cI realized I could pull, and I could pancake people.\u201d That became his goal, to build a head of steam and flatten an opponent. \u201cEvery time I came off the ball, I wanted to hit somebody,\u201d he said.\n\nHead coach Steve Spurrier has often admired his new offensive linemen in practice, and said they have \u201cexcellent attitudes.\u201d Bailey said coaches haven\u2019t yet broached the possibility of redshirting this season, which Spurrier indicated may depend on other players staying healthy. As far as Elliott is concerned, his freshmen will play if they show they\u2019re ready.\n\n\u201cThis group\u2019s got as good a chance as any that I\u2019ve been around,\u201d he said. \u201cThey keep working, who knows. It may be the first game, it may be the fifth game, but somebody\u2019s going to break through. And they\u2019re going to break through because they want it bad enough.\u201d\n\nFor Bailey, it would be one more step in a rapid ascent. Six years ago, he wasn\u2019t interested in football at all. Even at Summerville, he didn\u2019t think seriously about playing in college \u2014 until USC called with a scholarship offer. \u201cI went home and told my mom, and she was like, \u2018Are you kidding me?\u2019 \u201d he said. Other offers followed, but the Gamecocks were first, and closest to home.\n\n\u201cThe decision you make isn\u2019t for the next four years, it\u2019s for the rest of your life,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is your family now. This is where you\u2019re going to grow up. The offensive linemen here now, they\u2019re going to be at my wedding. It\u2019s a big decision.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "For Gamecocks\u2019 Zack Bailey, an unlikely path from Seattle to Summerville to USC, Sports, \r\nSportssouthcarolina, \r\nFP LatestNews, \r\nrsssports, \r\nrsssports, Gamecocks,SEC football,Summerville football,Zack Bailey", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "COLUMBIA \u2014 He was a kid who hung out on the couch, played video games and ate potato chips.
