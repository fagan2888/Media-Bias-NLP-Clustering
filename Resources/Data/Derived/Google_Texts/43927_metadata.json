Uninsured residents in one of the world\u2019s most expensive cities finally had access to affordable, quality health care.\n\nWhile the Affordable Care Act opened up the possibility that some of the 60,000 San Francisco residents participating in the program could obtain insurance, coverage remains out of reach for others, despite the availability of federal subsidies. To the relief of many, Healthy San Francisco will continue to operate for uninsured individuals who do not qualify for Medi-Cal or Covered California, such as undocumented immigrants. But the days of anyone signing up for Healthy San Francisco and eschewing insurance are over. As the end of 2014 approaches, tens of thousands of current Healthy San Francisco program participants are expected to remain uninsured, and the city is scrambling to create a plan to make federally required insurance affordable for them.\n\nFacing a fine for not signing up for insurance has not been the only concern for Healthy San Francisco participants; they also worry about continuity of affordable care.\n\nFinding a Way To Preserve San Francisco\u2019s Safety Net\n\nFor months, the Universal Health Care Council \u2014 whose 41 members come from government, as well as businesses and health and labor groups \u2014 has worked to devise a plan to best implement the ACA in San Francisco. One of the primary recommendations was that the city\u2019s Health Care Security Ordinance \u2014 the set of regulations under which Healthy San Francisco operates \u2014 be changed to close a loophole that was letting valuable funds slip out of certain types of health care accounts and into employer\u2019s pockets.\n\nOne of the major facets of the HCSO was to ensure all patients received funding from their Health Reimbursement Accounts, a feature of Healthy San Francisco that previously has been exploited by employers as a loophole. When employees weren\u2019t using HRA funds, some employers were diverting funds to themselves.\n\nWorking closely with the Universal Health Care Council, Supervisor David Campos drafted legislation to protect the true nature of HSCO by phasing out over the next three years the option for employers to divert unused funds to themselves and instead only go toward health care.\n\nCampos\u2019 amendment, passed in June, requires DPH to \u201cdevelop a plan to ensure that employer health care expenditures made to the city \u2026 can be used to maximize enrollment in health insurance through Covered California \u2026 in time for full implementation beginning in the 2016 Covered California Plan year.\u201d\n\nWorking on Affordability\n\nIt is precisely because of the HCSO and Healthy San Francisco that the city is ahead of the curve on ACA implementation, San Francisco Department of Public Health officials said, but it does not solve the long-term issue of affordability.\n\n\u201cWe see the Health Care Security Ordinance, and we feel really lucky,\u201d said Hillary Ronen, legislative aide to Campos. \u201cIt makes the Affordable Care Act much more successful.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not dealing with as much of a backlog of people who have had no health care at all, versus other cities in California,\u201d said Ronen. \u201cBut we have different ideas about what is affordable than the rest of California.\u201d\n\nCity officials are sensitive to the fact that Healthy San Francisco has been the only affordable health care option for certain individuals \u2014 such as part-time employees and employees of small businesses \u2014 and those people could continue to face difficulties in affording health insurance. San Francisco DPH estimates as many as 51,000 people may remain uninsured at the end of 2014, and nearly 15,000 will not be exempt from the individual mandate and its fines.\n\n\u201cFor now, the policy is extended, so now we are charged with finding a way to make it more affordable for individuals,\u201d said Colleen Chawla, director of policy and planning for the city\u2019s DPH. \u201cBut how do we decide what is affordable? We have to devise a new definition for that.\u201d\n\n\u201cSan Francisco is such a high-cost city, with people living paycheck to paycheck \u2014 and spending most of that on rent \u2014 that health care is still unaffordable,\u201d Ronen said.\n\nChawla noted that at the very least, the city knows how many people are uninsured and struggling to afford health insurance, facts that are not immediately known to other California city officials.\n\nPlans for a Covered San Francisco Dropped\n\nHCSO was not the original plan for preserving health care in San Francisco. When Campos and public health officials first started anticipating gaps in coverage with the implementation of ACA, they envisioned a program called Covered San Francisco that would have provided eligible participants with financial assistance to reduce the price of health insurance purchased through Covered California.\n\nBut the plan was scrapped due to feasibility, officials say.\n\n\u201cCovered San Francisco just wasn\u2019t the best model,\u201d said Chawla. \u201cIt was too prescriptive and rigid, and we faced challenges in opening it to all of San Francisco in the first place.\u201d\n\nThe framework of Covered California will still be used as a guide for creating a public benefit program to increase affordability of health insurance for low-income San Franciscans, city officials said.\n\nConsidering Other Options\n\nIn early June, a small group of stakeholders \u2014 community clinic leaders, public health officials and government officials \u2014 met to discuss what the future of the ACA in San Francisco would be as Healthy San Francisco is phased out by the beginning of 2015.\n\n\u201cWe came away from that meeting discovering that this is quite complex,\u201d Chawla said. \u201cThere are a lot of moving parts.\u201d\n\nChawla said DPH is considering a variety of strategies, from a voucher system to grant programs, but it will take considerable time to implement a plan.\n\nEven those who are moving into Covered California appear to view living in San Francisco as a health hazard, according to a statement by public health officials.\n\nAmong those who signed up for coverage through Covered California in the exchange\u2019s first enrollment period, San Francisco residents had the highest selection of catastrophic coverage in the state, with more than 9% of the non-subsidy population choosing those kinds of plans. San Francisco officials believe the high cost of living in the city influenced those decisions.\n\nMore than 40,000 San Franciscans purchased plans through Covered California during the exchange\u2019s first open enrollment period. Like the rest of the state, more than 80% of San Franciscans enrolling in Covered California plans were eligible for federal subsidies.\n\nWhile there is no mechanism in place to track whether a San Francisco resident moves from Healthy San Francisco to Covered California, Chawla said there has been an overall reduction in Healthy San Francisco participation.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t really know what that means yet,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a hard situation to go through, and we have to really sift through to make sure we don\u2019t overlook anyone or anything.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "San Franciscans unable to afford health coverage through Covered California can continue to receive care through the city's universal health plan until 2015, while city officials work to create a subsidy program to satisfy federal mandates.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "California Healthline", "description": "San Franciscans unable to afford health coverage through Covered California can continue to receive care through the city\u2019s universal health plan until 2015, while city officials work to crea\u2026", "title": "Landmark Healthy San Francisco Remains Safety Net During Transition Period", "url": "http://californiahealthline.org/news/landmark-healthy-san-francisco-remains-safety-net-during-transition-period/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/kaiser-californiahealthline/static/images/placeholder.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@CalHealthline", "card": "summary", "creator": "@CalHealthline"}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://californiahealthline.org/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico", "application-name": "California Healthline", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WordPresscom", "published_time": "2014-07-11T06:56:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-11T06:56:00+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb560\"", "article_summary": "While there is no mechanism in place to track whether a San Francisco resident moves from Healthy San Francisco to Covered California, Chawla said there has been an overall reduction in Healthy San Francisco participation.\nPlans for a Covered San Francisco DroppedHCSO was not the original plan for preserving health care in San Francisco.\nBy many accounts, Healthy San Francisco \u2014 the city\u2019s landmark universal health care plan launched in 2007 \u2014 has been a success.\nBut the days of anyone signing up for Healthy San Francisco and eschewing insurance are over.\nSan Francisco officials believe the high cost of living in the city influenced those decisions."}
