The U.S. credit and housing bubble that triggered the recent financial crisis is set to come to life this December through the film adaptation of “The Big Short,” the best seller written by Michael Lewis.

The film, starring Ryan Gosling, Brad Pitt, Christian Bale and Steve Carell is set for a Dec. 11 U.S. limited release date followed by a Dec. 23 nationwide debut.

“The Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine,” was published in 2010 and tracks the investors and financiers who profited wildly by betting millions of dollars on the collapse of complex mortgage securities backed by home loans to borrowers with dicey credit in 2008, while the rest of the country was reeling from financial Armageddon.

Paramount Pictures posted “The Big Short” trailer on YouTube Tuesday. Watch it here:
