Ron Wyden of Oregon are backing him up.\n\nMeanwhile, key Senate and House Democrats and independents \u2013 including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California and Sens. Bernie Sanders of Rhode Island and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts \u2013 are demanding the inclusion of tough restrictions on currency manipulation by U.S. trading partners that could boost their exports and expand their workforce at the expense of U.S. workers and businesses.\n\nRelated: An Angry Obama Blasts Democrats on Trade Deal\n\nCritics complain that the fast-track approach enables lawmakers to abdicate their constitutional duties to regulate international trade and allowing the administration to gloss over the emerging details of the agreement until it is too late to do anything about them.\n\nPelosi told reporters last week that as part of any final agreement on a bill, Congress must first \u201cspeak to the issue of currency manipulation, which has had a negative impact on job loss in our 5country. She called the emerging fast-track legislation a major \u201cpothole\u201d rather than a political bump in the road.\n\nWithout totally ruling out the possibility of supporting the final version of the legislation, Pelosi urged the Republicans to work with Democrats to develop a better framework.\n\nSanders, an independent who is considering a bid for president, is unyielding in his opposition to both the fast-track process and the underlying TPP. \"This job-killing trade deal has been negotiated in secret,\" Sanders said, \"It was drafted with input by special interests and corporate lobbyists but not from the elected representatives of the American people.\"\n\nDemocratic Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio tried to push through an amendment to the fast-track legislation in the Senate Finance Committee to block currency manipulation, but fell short. However, the Finance Committee voted 18 to 8 to add a similar provision to a separate bill that would mandate the Commerce Department to treat currency manipulation as an illegal export subsidy and to impose duties to counter it.\n\nRelated: Cruz and Ryan \u2013 Don\u2019t Trust Obama\u2026Except on Trade Talks\n\nBrown and other lawmakers vowed to take the fight to the floor in the coming weeks to include the anti-currency manipulation measure to the underlying fast-track trade legislation.\n\nWilliam Galston, a government scholar with the Brookings Institution, said in an interview that while the trade debate is highly complex and almost metaphysical, but \u201cThe importance of the issue for Democrats and some Republicans as well is clear.\u201d\n\nCurrency manipulation is, to put it simply, using the government\u2019s control over the money supply to artificially adjust the value of one currency relative to others. It usually involves the purchase or sale of the target currency in foreign exchange markets; when used to create advantages in the area of foreign trade, it\u2019s considered illegal. For instance, exports from a country with a currency that is weak compared to its trading partners will be cheaper, giving that country\u2019s businesses a theoretical advantage in the global marketplace.\n\nHowever, governments frequently buy and sell in the foreign exchange markets, and there is no bright line that once crossed signals the move from legitimate to illegitimate activity. Early this year, the Russian government blew through a large portion of its foreign currency reserves in an effort to prop up the tumbling ruble. Far from subjecting the Kremlin to accusations of currency manipulation, international observers generally viewed the move as a reasonable response to a serious problem.\n\nChina, by contrast, is regularly cited as a currency manipulator, despite the fact that the value of the yuan against the U.S. dollar has actually been climbing, albeit slowly, for years now. (There is more compelling evidence of past currency manipulation by Beijing in the 1990s and 2000s, when it developed a massive trade surplus.)\n\nThe standard response to a country believed to be engaged in unfair trade practices is the imposition of tariffs meant to make exports more expensive. Of course, tariffs are a no-no between the signatories of free trade agreements, which is why those concerned about currency manipulation want to see strict prohibitions of the practice written into trade deals before they are singed.\n\nRelated: Forget Benghazi \u2013 Blame Hillary for the Disastrous Russian Reset\n\nThe AFL-CIO, the Alliance for American Manufacturing, the United Steelworkers and others have pleaded with the administration for years to provide relief from China\u2019s price-distorting currency manipulation. The administration responded with inaction.\n\nTreasury Secretary Jack Lew for months has resisted Democratic calls for measures to prevent China and other countries from artificially depressing their currencies in order to make their exports cheaper than those of the U.S. and other countries with stronger currencies.\n\nAccording to The New York Times, the administration is concerned that a ban on currency manipulation might backfire if U.S. trading partners raised strong objections to the Federal Reserve\u2019s use of currency sales or purchases to bolster U.S. economic growth.\n\nIn a letter to Congress last week, Lew said the proposed currency manipulation raised questions about the \u201cconsistency with our international obligations.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "It doesn\u2019t readily lend itself to a catchy bumper sticker slogan,\u00a0but \u201cStop Currency M", "title": "\u2018Stop Currency Manipulation\u2019 The New Battle Cry of the Democrats", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/27/Stop-Currency-Manipulation-New-Battle-Cry-Democrats", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/08082011_Currency_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/27/Stop-Currency-Manipulation-New-Battle-Cry-Democrats", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/08082011_Currency_article.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@ericpianin"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "It doesn\u2019t readily lend itself to a catchy bumper sticker slogan,\u00a0but \u201cStop Currency M", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd06c2\"", "article_summary": "It doesn\u2019t readily lend itself to a catchy bumper sticker slogan, but \u201cStop Currency Manipulation\u201d has become the battle cry of Democrats and labor groups as they try to upend President Obama\u2019s fast-track trade accord with Pacific-rim countries.\nFar from subjecting the Kremlin to accusations of currency manipulation, international observers generally viewed the move as a reasonable response to a serious problem.\nIn a letter to Congress last week, Lew said the proposed currency manipulation raised questions about the \u201cconsistency with our international obligations.\u201dTop Reads from The Fiscal Times\n(There is more compelling evidence of past currency manipulation by Beijing in the 1990s and 2000s, when it developed a massive trade surplus.)\nEarly this year, the Russian government blew through a large portion of its foreign currency reserves in an effort to prop up the tumbling ruble."}
