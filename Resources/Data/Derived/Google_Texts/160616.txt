As Wednesday’s Granite State Debate involving candidates in the 2nd Congressional District wrapped up, candidate Marilinda Garcia refused to shake opponent Gary Lambert's hand.

Commitment 2014: Race in 2nd Congressional District of NH Meet the candidates in the 2nd Congressional District of New Hampshire: Marilinda Garcia (R), Annie Kuster (D), Gary Lambert (R) and Jim Lawrence (R). More

The candidates addressed the moment in the spin room.

Garcia accused Lambert of distorting her record.

"I saw his latest ad today saying such ludicrous things that I support Obamacare, and I just simply told him, 'I can’t shake your hand at this time,’” said Garcia.

Lambert, meanwhile, said he was surprised Garcia turned down the handshake.

“I went to shake her hand and I was actually shocked,” said Lambert.

Garcia shook the hand of her other opponent, Jim Lawrence.

Garcia later apologized for turning down the handshake Thursday afternoon during an appearance on WKXL.

The Granite State Debates continue at 7 p.m. Thursday with the Republican candidates for U.S. Senate.

On Friday, the GOP hopefuls for governor go head-to-head in a debate hosted by WMUR-TV.
