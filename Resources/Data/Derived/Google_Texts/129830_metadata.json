Between 10 and 15 percent each pick four other issues, including the way Washington works, health care, international conflicts and immigration.\n\nWashington Post-ABC News poll Sept. 4-7. Results based on 888 registered voters, margin of sampling error +/- 4 points.\n\nVoters' focus on a slowly recovering economy might not seem like something that would accrue to Democrats's benefit, yet voters who prioritize the economy say 53 percent to 40 percent that they currently would support a generic Democrat over a generic Republican.\n\nRepublicans, meanwhile, win the most support among the 12 percent of voters focused on international conflicts. They favor GOP candidates by 22 percentage points over Democrats. Voters focused on health care, the way Washington works and immigration all split their votes by single digit margins which are not statistically significant.\n\nThe Democrats' focus on the economy and the GOP's focus on overseas issues actually make sense, though, since issue priorities are often driven by partisanship. Partisans tend to place a bigger priority on issues where they are critical of a party or president they dislike. For instance, Gallup polling last month found Republicans were much more apt to say immigration is the nation's top problem as the Obama administration came under criticism for it's handling of unaccompanied children at the border. And in 2006, exit polling showed voters who supported Democrats were far more likely to prioritize the then-unpopular Iraq war.\n\nIn this light, Democrats might find some solace in the new Post-ABC poll, which shows Republicans are less apt than Democrats to cite the economy and jobs as their most important issue (30 percent vs. 41 percent). Republican voters are diffuse in their electoral motivations, with 19 percent focused on international conflicts and 15 percent choosing immigration -- both that's still more than registered voters overall.\n\nAt the very least, the lack of unity suggests the slowly recovering economy and the health care law are not the cudgels that Republicans once wielded against Democrats.\n\nBut the diffuse GOP issues matrix basically all centers around one thing: criticism of President Obama. Fully 62 percent of Republican voters say one reason for their congressional vote will be to express opposition to Obama; just 42 percent of Democrats say they will vote in an effort to support him.\n\nUnlike past elections, though, that criticism isn't really rooted in the economy or Obamacare.", "article_metadata": {"description": "How much does Democrats' advantage on the economy matter", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "How much does Democrats' advantage on the economy matter", "title": "The economy is voters\u2019 top issue, and Democrats are winning it", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2014/09/10/the-economy-is-voters-top-issue-and-democrats-are-winning-it/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2012/07/06/Production/Digital/homepage/Images/147898373.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@sfcpoll"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2014/09/10/the-economy-is-voters-top-issue-and-democrats-are-winning-it/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "poll, midterm election, 2014 election, obama, election issues", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "poll, midterm election, 2014 election, obama, election issues"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbcbd\"", "article_summary": "And in 2006, exit polling showed voters who supported Democrats were far more likely to prioritize the then-unpopular Iraq war.\nThe Democrats' focus on the economy and the GOP's focus on overseas issues actually make sense, though, since issue priorities are often driven by partisanship.\nBetween 10 and 15 percent each pick four other issues, including the way Washington works, health care, international conflicts and immigration.\nAt the very least, the lack of unity suggests the slowly recovering economy and the health care law are not the cudgels that Republicans once wielded against Democrats.\nFully 62 percent of Republican voters say one reason for their congressional vote will be to express opposition to Obama; just 42 percent of Democrats say they will vote in an effort to support him."}
