The company currently has four million members in China using the International English version of the site.\n\nIn LinkedIn\u2019s 10-K annual report also filed on Feb. 25, the company discussed its Fiscal 2013 Joint Venture with Dragon Networking, an affiliate of China Broadband Capital, and SCCV IV Success HoldCo, Ltd., an affiliate of venture firm Sequoia Capital. The joint venture agreement is to engage in the investment, organization, management and operation of LinkedIn CN Limited, a professional social network in the People\u2019s Republic of China.\n\nIn a blog post on Feb. 25, LinkedIn Chief Executive Officer Jeff Weiner explained that the goal of the beta site in simple Chinese and the joint venture projects is to reach \u201cthe country\u2019s more than 140 million professionals who currently represent roughly one in five of the world\u2019s knowledge workers. Our goal is to connect these Chinese professionals with each other and with the rest of LinkedIn\u2019s 277 million members,\u201d he said.\n\nAnalysts have questioned whether LinkedIn can succeed in China given the very different hiring culture and the failure of other American Internet companies to succeed due to censorship and high regulation by the Chinese government.\n\nAn analyst report by GlobalData released on Jan. 30 of this year stated, \u201cLinkedIn was blocked by the Chinese government after a user\u2019s comments related to prospective Jasmine Revolution in China.\u201d\n\nSocio-political risks continue to be named by analysts as one of the largest potential threats to LinkedIn, which now operates in over 200 countries and territories.\n\nWith over 100 million users in the U.S., LinkedIn has nearly saturated the market for American knowledge workers \u2014 who account for about a third of the workforce in the United States, according to an article by Thomas Davenport in the Harvard Business School Press.\n\nIn order to continue its steady growth trajectory, LinkedIn has to focus on expansion abroad, the article said.\n\nWith more than 618 million users, China has the world\u2019s largest online community, attractive to many Internet giants, including LinkedIn. But the so-called \u201cGreat Firewall\u201d blocks any online forums or content deemed sensitive by the government, posing challenges for many American companies.\n\nGoogle, for example, ceased its mainland China search engine service in 2010 after resolving not to censor search results.\n\nFacebook and Twitter were banned from the country after their sites were used by protestors in the Middle East and North Africa to organize uprisings in late 2010, as part of the Arab Spring that overthrew longstanding regimes.\n\nEarlier this month, Microsoft\u2019s Bing search engine came under scrutiny. Microsoft has typically complied with censorship rules within China.\n\nIn another recent blog post, Weiner said, \u201cGiven the rapid acceleration and development of China\u2019s economy, the expansion of our offering in China marks a significant step forward in our mission to connect the world\u2019s professionals to make them more productive and successful.\u201d But, given the need to find growth outside the U.S., one must wonder if this expansion is truly the right decision.\n\nIn deciding to enter China, LinkedIn has agreed to abide by the country\u2019s censorship laws.\n\nWeiner\u2019s blog post stated that, \u201cLinkedIn strongly supports freedom of expression and fundamentally disagrees with government censorship.\u201d\n\nHe acknowledged in the same post that censorship is a requirement for Internet platforms in China but emphasized that, \u201cGovernment restrictions on content will be implemented only when and to the extent required. LinkedIn will be transparent about how it conducts business in China \u2026 [and] the company will undertake extensive measures to protect the rights and data of our members.\u201d\n\nBeyond the question of censorship, there is also the question of hiring culture and policies in China, which greatly vary from those of the United States. This is especially true when it comes to openness about salaries.\n\nWeiner said in his influencer post that the objective of the Chinese site is to build a talent marketplace: one that would be attractive both to multinational companies looking to expand their presence in China, and to Chinese companies looking for a stronger foreign presence.\n\nThe emphasis on the multinational and foreign marketplaces reflects similarities among youth and entrepreneurial workers in China, LinkedIn has found.\n\nDerek Shen, recently hired as president of LinkedIn China, said in a statement that LinkedIn has already integrated popular Chinese services such as Sina and Tencent into its China service, making it easier for members to import their contacts.\n\nShen has worked previously in China for Google, Nuomi and Renren Inc. and brings experience in navigating China\u2019s many censorship laws.\n\nHomepage composite image: China photo courtesy of Microsoft Office Clip Art and Media; logo courtesy of LinkedIn.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Business,China,Chinese,facebook,Google,Lauren Ottinger,LinkedIn,LinkedIn China,People\u2019s Republic of China,social network,social networking,Technology,Twitter,Business & Money,Frontpage Featured", "description": "The Mountain View-based site points to expansion into China as a primary growth strategy.
