It\u2019s down 3 percent in the last six months alone.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the Institute for Supply Management Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index came in at 48.2 for January.\n\nThat\u2019s four months in a row the index has been below 50 \u2013 and a reading below 50 points to contraction in U.S. manufacturing.\n\nThe American Consumer Won\u2019t Ride to the Rescue\n\nDon\u2019t expect consumption to spur growth, either. U.S. consumers, responsible for around three-quarters of GDP growth, aren\u2019t stepping up.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Commerce Department, personal spending in December was flat from a month earlier. Spending on durable goods fell 0.9 percent in December. And spending on nondurable goods also fell 0.9 percent.\n\nThose numbers mean the end retailers\u2019 most important quarter \u2013 and a true picture of consumers\u2019 propensity for spending \u2013 has been a disaster.\n\nIt\u2019s not hard to see why\u2026 Those consumers\u2019 wages have only increased 2.2 percent in the past five years.\n\nIt gets worse\u2026\n\nFor all of 2015, retail sales \u2013 including autos \u2013 were the worst since 2008-2009.\n\nWhen you consider that anemic wage growth, rising healthcare costs courtesy of Obamacare, and an uptick in the savings rate to 5.5 percent, it\u2019s highly unlikely that consumers will prove positive for GDP growth in 2016.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the stock market.\n\nLow, Zero, and Negative Interest Rate Policies Helped Bring Us Here\n\nNow, it\u2019s important to note that not all steep market sell-offs signal a recession ahead. But this time around, frighteningly, that\u2019s exactly what they\u2019re doing\u2026\n\nThe January 2016 sell-off in U.S. stocks followed global equity markets getting hit last summer through year-end 2015. Now we\u2019re all headed lower.\n\nSelling isn\u2019t the result of a valuation correction. What\u2019s happening is investors are selling over fears of falling earnings \u2013 or an outright collapse.\n\nThe root cause of global market volatility, and why the equity markets\u2019 selling off portends a coming global recession, is all about currencies.\n\nThe currency market is the largest market in the world. Trillions of dollars of currencies trade every single day, dwarfing the volume of all the world\u2019s equity markets combined.\n\nThat\u2019s because currencies are used to buy goods and services the world over, and as global trade has grown, more and more trading is necessary to make payments in different currencies.\n\nCurrencies don\u2019t just move up and down based on short-term buying and selling based on daily trade transactions. They mostly move up and down relative to each other based on interest rate differentials between countries.\n\nAnd interest rate differentials are now the \u201clast stand\u201d for central bankers whose low-interest, zero-interest, and negative-interest rate policies have done nothing to keep staggering economies from slip-sliding back towards recession.\n\nRaging Currency Wars Will Make Things Worse\n\nBy managing their currencies down, exporters cheapen the cost of the goods and services they sell globally.\n\nWith the sole exception of the United States, which has the largest domestic consumer economy in the world and is still an export juggernaut, almost every country in the world relies on exports to propel growth.\n\nBut when lowered interest rates, which cheapen a country\u2019s currency relative to its trading partners, are met with counter-party interest rate cuts, trading partners and exporting competitors have nowhere to go \u2013 and nothing to do but to try and keep lowering interest rates.\n\nWhen countries compete to lower rates to spur exports, they\u2019re said to be in a \u201crace to the bottom\u201d (who can lower their currency further and faster) strategy to maintain export revenue.\n\nNot only has that been happening, but it will get a lot worse as exports everywhere are falling.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund recently noted that the 2015 year-over-year change in global exports was the second lowest it\u2019s seen since 1958.\n\nThe smallest change was in 2008-2009.\n\nAs \u201ccurrency wars\u201d heat up in Asia, South America, and elsewhere, the U.S. dollar remains strong, and on a relative currency basis, it is getting more expensive.\n\nThat means the Chinese, emerging markets, and other global debtors \u2013 all of them exporters, who grew their economies and export businesses by funding growth with trillions in dollar-denominated loans \u2013 will see the cost of their debt skyrocket.\n\nThe only way they can pay it off is to export more to generate revenue.\n\nThat \u201cnegative feedback loop\u201d will cause major devaluations in currencies, debt defaults, and bankruptcies worldwide. At the same time, U.S. multinationals who get increasingly larger revenue streams from overseas will see that revenue decimated when they have to translate earnings in foreign currencies back into U.S. dollars.\n\nStock markets see this. Earnings will get hit, and for some companies, they\u2019ll collapse.\n\nBetween faltering industrial production in the United States and across the globe, retrenching consumers here and elsewhere when layoffs will be announced in the first quarter and all year, and investors selling on account of rapidly diminishing earnings in the face of escalating currency wars, the warning lights couldn\u2019t be any brighter.\n\nI\u2019m not the only one who sees the U.S. facing a recession. But I am the only voice predicting a serious and lengthy global recession will push the United States into that black hole with almost everyone else.\n\nThis Could Be the End for Big Oil\n\nA stunning breakthrough has unleashed a massive supply of fuel \u2013 enough to power the entire globe for over 36,000 years. It\u2019s poised to decimate Big Oil\u2019s obscene profits, make OPEC obsolete, and hand the United States 100% energy independence.
