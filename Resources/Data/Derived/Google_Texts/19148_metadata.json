Others posted on the blog show members in chains or wearing masks.\n\nIn response, Rush -- a Gainesville attorney and former deputy with Alachua County Sheriff\u2019s Office -- posted a press release on his website Tuesday complete with his own pictures.\n\nRush writes that he's been enthusiastic about theater and acting his whole life, although he says that should have nothing to do with his campaign for Florida Congress.\n\n\u201cAs a practicing Christian, I am deeply offended that the opposing campaign and their supporters would take a gaming and theatre hobby and mischaracterize it,\u201d Rush writes in the press release.\n\nThe \"opposing campaign\" is a reference to Tea Party incumbent Ted Yoho.\n\n\u201cBottom line - There is nothing wrong with being a gamer. It\u2019s kinda nerdy, but North Central Florida deserves a legitimate debate on the issues instead of Ted Yoho\u2019s usual sideshow distractions,\u201d the press release reads.\n\nThe press release doesn't mention what role, if any, Rush took within MES, but it does provide some information about the society and a link to its website.\n\nHowever, Rush's father, Robert Rush, told Business Insider that he knows of his son's occassional involvement with role-playing societies, saying the recent reports are part of a smear campaign orchestrated by Yoho.\n\nRush is a conservative Republican whose focuses are on cutting government spending, repealing Obamacare and supporting small business to promote economic growth. He's also pro-life and supports the 2nd Amendment.\n\nRush and Yoho will face off in the primary election Aug. 26.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Florida candidate responds to reported links to vampire role-playing society", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Orlando Sentinel", "author": "Orlando Sentinel", "og": {"site_name": "OrlandoSentinel.com", "description": "For some, Florida congressional candidate Jake Rush is better known as Chazz Darling, a character within the vampire cosplaying group Mind's Eye Society.", "title": "Florida candidate responds to reported links to vampire role-playing society", "url": "http://www.orlandosentinel.com/features/gone-viral/os-florida-congressional-candidate-vampire-20140402-post.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-533c4025/turbine/os-florida-congressional-candidate-vampire-20140402", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp14.17", "twitter": {"site": "@orlandosentinel", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "florida congressional candidate vampire", "fb": {"admins": 100004353067097, "page_id": 5779052556, "app_id": 890804050949750}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=402223551, app-argument=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/deeplinkid/79798788", "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2014-04-02", "Description": "For some, Florida congressional candidate Jake Rush is better known as Chazz Darling, a character within the vampire cosplaying group Mind's Eye Society.", "y_key": "fb73650ad672fe45", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "florida congressional candidate vampire"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9068\"", "article_summary": "For some, Florida congressional candidate Jake Rush is better known as Chazz Darling, a character within the vampire role-playing group Mind's Eye Society.\nPictures like this one show Rush wearing colored contacts dressed in all black.\nIt\u2019s kinda nerdy, but North Central Florida deserves a legitimate debate on the issues instead of Ted Yoho\u2019s usual sideshow distractions,\u201d the press release reads.\nRush has had to defend his role-playing past after Florida-based SaintPetersBlog.com published an account of his time with MES on Tuesday.\nThe press release doesn't mention what role, if any, Rush took within MES, but it does provide some information about the society and a link to its website."}
