OSU Marching Band

TV fans who turned up for the Ohio State/Virginia Tech game this past weekend got a nice ode to the small screen.

The OSU Marching Band performed a fantastic television-themed halftime show over the course of 10 minutes, where they dipped into classic and current TV shows like “Dragnet,” “The Simpsons,” “The Office,” “Game of Thrones” and more.

They even went the extra step and made human formations of Bart Simpson, the Batmobile and our favorite – the opening character split-screen featured on “The Brady Bunch.”

Ohio State’s marching band had dipped into pop-culture presentations before – last October, they performed a “Michael Jackson Tribute” at the Iowa game and a “Hollywood Blockbusters” night at the Penn State game, the latter performance taking on themes from “Harry Potter,” “Superman,” “Lord of the Rings,” “Jurassic Park,” and more. Hundreds of thousands of views promptly followed.
