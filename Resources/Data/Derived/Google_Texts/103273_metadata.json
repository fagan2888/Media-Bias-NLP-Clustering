You just gotta stand up, be accountable and be who you are and try to stand for the right things.\n\n\u201cAnd our guys do that.\u201d\n\nJoe Flacco set up Tucker\u2019s game-winner with a 32-yard pass to Steve Smith with 1:28 left. Smith beat Pro Bowl cornerback Joe Haden before hauling in Flacco\u2019s pass and taking it to Cleveland\u2019s 13. The Ravens ran the clock down before bringing in Tucker, who split the uprights and sent the Browns (1-2) to another tough loss.\n\nIt was the kind of play the Ravens expected from Smith, signed as a free agent in the offseason. And, it was typical Flacco, who finished 19 of 31 for 217 yards with one touchdown.\n\n\u201cWe call him, \u2018Joe Cool,\u2019\u201d Smith said. \u201cThroughout the whole game, good or bad, Joe stays the same.\u201d\n\nThe Browns blew several chances to put the Ravens away in the second half. Cleveland missed a field goal, had one blocked, committed 12 penalties and wide receiver rookie Taylor Gabriel fell after catching a long pass from Brian Hoyer, failing to score what should have been an easy touchdown.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a long two weeks,\u201d Hoyer said. \u201cI know we\u2019re going to watch this film and be mad at ourselves. We had some opportunities to put this game away and we didn\u2019t do it. It\u2019s on us.\u201d\n\nFollowing the game, Harbaugh addressed an ESPN report that claims he wanted the team to immediately release Rice in February after he was arrested for punching his then-fiancee. The report says Harbaugh was overruled by owner Steve Bisciotti and general manager Ozzie Newsome.\n\n\u201cI can tell you this, we work together in our organization,\u201d Harbaugh said. \u201cEvery single football decision we make, we work together. You get together, you hash it out. Everybody\u2019s got their opinions. It\u2019s not black and white. It\u2019s never nuanced on anything. That decision was exactly like all the other ones. When we walk out of that room, we are united.\u201d\n\nHarbaugh said he thought the team handled the case the right way. \u201cI felt like we did the right thing and I stand behind it.\u201d\n\nHoyer completed 19 of 25 passes for 290 yards. Along with the blown opportunities, the Browns had a fake play in which backup quarterback Johnny Manziel fooled Baltimore\u2019s defense negated by a penalty. Manziel started to leave the field and pretended to have a conversation with offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan.\n\nThe Browns quickly snapped the ball and Hoyer threw a pass to Manziel for a 39-yard gain, but the play was brought back by an illegal shift.\n\n\u201cIt worked pretty well,\u201d Manziel said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t see it coming. Unfortunately we got a penalty on it.\u201d\n\nRavens rookie Lorenzo Taliaferro rushed for 91 yards and one TD. He filled in for Bernard Pierce \u2014 Rice\u2019s replacement\u2014 who sat out with a thigh injury. Smith had five catches for 101 yards.\n\nNot everything went Baltimore\u2019s way. Tight end Dennis Pitta was taken to a hospital after he appeared to sustain a serious hip injury in the first half. Pitta, who played in just four games last season after dislocating his right hip in training camp, went down without being touched after catching a pass.\n\nThe Ravens didn\u2019t have a postgame update on Pitta, but his teammates were concerned for him.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a good friend, he\u2019s a good teammate and he\u2019s a hell of a player,\u201d Flacco said. \u201cNo matter who it is, it\u2019s tough to see that happen, especially when it looks like it might be serious.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Tucker's boot capped another challenging week for the Ravens (2-1), who continue to be dogged by questions surrounding running back Ray Rice's domestic violence suspension.", "Author": "Tom Withers", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Tucker\u2019s boot capped another challenging week for the Ravens (2-1), who continue to be dogged by questions surrounding running back Ray Rice\u2019s domestic violence suspension.", "title": "Justin Tucker field goal as time expires lifts Ravens over Browns", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/sep/21/justin-tucker-field-goal-time-expires-lifts-ravens/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/09/21/ravens-browns-footbal_lanc1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/09/21/ravens-browns-footbal_lanc1.jpg", "title": "Justin Tucker field goal as time expires lifts Ravens over Browns", "description": "Tucker's boot capped another challenging week for the Ravens (2-1), who continue to be dogged by questions surrounding running back Ray Rice's domestic violence suspension.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Sports, Baltimore Ravens, Ray Rice, Cleveland Browns, Baltimore"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe062f\"", "article_summary": "But for the second straight game, the Ravens blocked out any external noise and knocked off another division rival.\nThe Ravens ran the clock down before bringing in Tucker, who split the uprights and sent the Browns (1-2) to another tough loss.\nIt was the kind of play the Ravens expected from Smith, signed as a free agent in the offseason.\nWhile there are still questions about how their handling of Ray Rice\u2019s case, it\u2019s clear the Ravens haven\u2019t changed \u2014 on the field.\nRavens coach John Harbaugh is impressed with his team\u2019s ability to focus on the task at hand."}
