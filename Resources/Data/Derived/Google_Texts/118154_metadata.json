Ryan Pitts is the ninth living veteran to receive the nation's highest award for valor for actions in Iraq or Afghanistan.\n\nObama said the 28-year-old embodies the \u201chumility and loyalty\u201d that define America\u2019s troops, highlighting that Pitts considers the award \u201ca memorial for the guys who didn\u2019t come home.\u201d\n\nPitts earned the nation's top combat honor for his actions during a July 13, 2008, attack on a U.S. outpost in Wanat, Afghanistan. Roughly 200 enemy fighters, some armed with rocket-propelled grenades, opened fire on the installation.\n\n\u201cOne soldier described it as hell on earth,\u201d Obama said during the West Wing ceremony.\n\nPitts was wounded in the arms and legs by grenade shrapnel. Unable to stand on his own, Pitts lobbed several grenades at the insurgents, who drew so close the he could hear their voices. Pitts also pulled himself to his knees to man a machine gun against approaching insurgents.\n\nPitts had to whisper to a command post that he was the last U.S. soldier alive, as he called in for air support to repel the attackers.\n\nTwo additional troops arrived and Pitts helped direct the aerial attack that forced the insurgents back up the walls of the valley.\n\nObama honored the soldiers who died in the attack by reciting their names and asked their families to stand up and be recognized.\n\nThe president noted that Monday was also Pitts\u2019s second wedding anniversary. Pitts\u2019s wife, along with their 1-year-old son, were in attendance.\n\n\"It's going to be tough topping this one, as anniversaries go,\" Obama joked. But, he said, \u201cspeaking as someone who has been married for over 20 years, you should try. Don\u2019t rest on your laurels after just two years.\u201d\n\nPitts received thunderous applause after Obama awarded him the medal.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not bad to stand up on this one,\u201d the president said.\n\nObama then joked that the White House had a \u201cbig anniversary party\u201d planned, adding \u201cthe pleasures of family were hard-earned by this man.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Obama said Ryan Pitts embodies \"humility and loyalty\" that define U.S. troops.", "description": "Obama said Ryan Pitts embodies \"humility and loyalty\" that define U.S. troops.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Martin Matishak", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Obama said Ryan Pitts embodies \"humility and loyalty\" that define U.S. troops.", "title": "Obama bestows Medal of Honor on Afghan veteran for actions in 'hell on earth'", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/defense/212868-obama-bestows-medal-of-honor-on-afghan-vet", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/obamabarack_medalofhonor_072114getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-07-21T17:07:31-04:00", "type": "article"}, "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2014-07-21T17:07-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/defense/212868-obama-bestows-medal-of-honor-on-afghan-vet", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2014-07-21T16:05-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Kyle Balluck", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-21T16:05:53-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-21T17:07:31-04:00"}, "keywords": "Medal of Honor, War in Afghanistan,Ryan Pitts, President Obama,", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/defense/212868-obama-bestows-medal-of-honor-on-afghan-vet", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Obama said Ryan Pitts embodies \"humility and loyalty\" that define U.S. troops.", "card": "summary", "title": "Obama bestows Medal of Honor on Afghan veteran for actions in 'hell on earth'"}, "dcterms.title": "Obama bestows Medal of Honor on Afghan veteran for actions in 'hell on earth'"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe02aa\"", "article_summary": "President Obama on Monday bestowed the Medal of Honor on a former Army staff sergeant who fought off waves of enemy fighters in what has been described as one of the fiercest battles of the war in Afghanistan.\nRyan Pitts is the ninth living veteran to receive the nation's highest award for valor for actions in Iraq or Afghanistan.\n\u201cOne soldier described it as hell on earth,\u201d Obama said during the West Wing ceremony.\nDon\u2019t rest on your laurels after just two years.\u201dPitts received thunderous applause after Obama awarded him the medal.\nObama then joked that the White House had a \u201cbig anniversary party\u201d planned, adding \u201cthe pleasures of family were hard-earned by this man.\u201d"}
