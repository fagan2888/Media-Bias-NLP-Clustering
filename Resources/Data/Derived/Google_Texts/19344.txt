Most of the 850 home health care workers who lost their jobs with the local Visiting Nurse Association when it closed last year have found employment, VNA executives say.

After 46 years in operation, the non-profit, at one time the largest home health care organization in El Paso, began winding down its operations in October.

Executives expect to close the VNA for good at the end of this month.

Joe Wardy, a former El Paso mayor who has been the VNA’s president since early 2012, said there were two catastrophic blows that led to the non-profit’s demise: a $700,000 cut in what it was paid to care for patients insured by Medicaid, and the employee health insurance mandate under the Affordable Care Act.

“We were not even breakeven at the time, so a $700,000 cut in our reimbursements to provide the exact same services was pretty catastrophic,” Wardy said.

Of the 950 employees affected by the VNA’s closing, about 850 were home health care workers. Wardy told El Paso Inc. that of those 850, fewer than 15 applied for unemployment benefits.

The remaining 100 workers had jobs in administration or other areas. According to Wardy, about 40 of those workers have applied for unemployment benefits.

“For every patient, there was a provider who took care of them. For almost every patient who transferred, the provider went with the patient to the new entity,” Wardy said.

Tracey Moorhead is president and CEO of the Visiting Nurse Associations of America, based in Washington, D.C. It represents 170 non-profit VNAs nationwide. She said VNAs are struggling nationwide, although not many have had to close their doors.

“It’s fair to say that every home health agency in the country has been significantly and adversely affected by Medicare payment policy at the federal level,” Moorhead said.

“Our agencies,” she said, “are being killed – death by a thousand payment cuts – but also over-managed into the ground by Medicare oversight.”

When the VNA opened in El Paso with just two nurses on Dec. 1, 1967, it was one of the city’s first home health agencies. Reimbursements were generous and the non-profit had no significant competition.

But “the die was cast in 2005,” Wardy said.

Reimbursements have steadily declined and Wardy estimates there are now more than 150 competing home health care organizations operating in the El Paso region.

“If you have not developed a competitive organization that runs just like a business, with process improvement, strong performance measurement and extremely strong financial management, you cannot be a provider in today’s environment,” Wardy said.

The VNA had been just breaking even for years when Molina Healthcare cut the nonprofit’s Medicaid reimbursements by $700,000 in 2012.

In the meantime, new mandates under the Affordable Care Act were hurting the VNA, Wardy said. The health care law requires organizations with 50 or more employees to provide health insurance benefits to full-time employees or be hit with a penalty.

Although the Obama administration delayed the penalty until 2015, Wardy said the VNA would have to eventually provide all its full-time employees with health insurance or pay the penalty, which it could not afford to do.

So, Wardy said, the VNA had to cut the hours of many of its employees to 29 hours to circumvent the law’s 30-hour definition of a “full-time” employee.

“These poor people were already working part-time at minimum wage and we had to cut their hours,” Wardy said. “We had a 21.4-percent loss in our Medicaid patient population from August 2012 to August 2013.”

Last year, it became apparent to Wardy and the non-profit’s board that the organization was dying and needed hospice care.

“At what point do we say: Look, the trends are extremely negative. While we still have the opportunity to pay our employees and our obligations, why don’t we do a wind down of our operations so we can leave with some dignity,” Wardy said.

In October, the non-profit’s board decided the VNA would have to close and began transitioning its patients and health care workers to other home health care providers in El Paso.

“At that point, we were thinking we close or face bankruptcy,” said board chair Marilyn Munden.

The VNA transferred its last patient in December, according to Wardy.

“It went off without a hitch,” he said.

The non-profit is now operating with 14 administrative employees and plans to end operations completely the end of this month.
