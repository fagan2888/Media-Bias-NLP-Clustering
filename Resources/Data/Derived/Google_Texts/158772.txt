"I think we've come very far, very quickly," CEO and co-founder Mario Schlosser told CNBC.com. "We manage about $200 million in health-care spend right now."

Oscar is "incredibly happy" with its rising membership, which now stands at around 40,000 customers, Schlosser said. That's "about twice as high as we originally thought we'd be after two years of operation," he said, noting that it's been less than two full years since Oscar's Obamacare policies have been in effect.

About 85 percent of Oscar's members are in New York City, Long Island and several counties just north of the Big Apple, with the rest coming from a handful of counties in northern New Jersey.

Schlosser said he believes Oscar now has 12 percent to 15 percent of the individual insurance market in the New York counties where it operates—a healthy level given the significant amount of competition the company has from longstanding insurers as well as hospitals that jumped into the Obamacare market. That market share includes plans sold both on the state-run health insurance market and in the so-called off-exchange market.



Now, "we want to grow across the board," Schlosser said.



Doing so will be easier with Oscar's new round of funding. The capital infusion, about $65 million more than the prior investment, was led by Peter Thiel and Brian Singerman from Founders Fun and Li Ka-Shing of Horizon Ventures. The Wellington Management Fund and Goldman Sachs also participated, as did prior investors in Oscar.

Schlosser said the money will be used primarily for building up the staff, which now stands at around 185 people—100 or so more than at the start of 2014.
