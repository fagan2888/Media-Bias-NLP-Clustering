Blue Cross and Blue Shield customers in North Carolina will be getting refunds as the company works on what officials say are their most serious system failures in years.

The News & Observer of Raleigh reported that Blue Cross CEO Brad Wilson has been apologizing to customers and promising to refund any money wrongly drafted from customers' bank account.

The Chapel Hill insurer has been dealing with the problem for a week, shortly after individual policies under the Affordable Care Act went into effect Jan. 1.

Some customers were upset when they could not confirm whether they were insured.

Wilson says about 25,000 customers were accidentally put into the wrong health plans. He says the company took the wrong amount from the bank accounts of about 3,200 customers.
