(Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nALBANY - Pregnant women will soon get more flexibility to receive health insurance coverage in New York state.\n\nBeginning Jan. 1, New York will become the first state to allow women to enroll in an insurance plan through the state-run marketplace at any point during a pregnancy, not only during the three-month annual enrollment period for the general public.\n\nThe change was made in a bill signed into law last week by Gov. Andrew Cuomo after state lawmakers approved it in June.\n\nUnder the new law, pregnancy will join milestones like marriage, birth and gaining citizenship on a list of \u201cqualifying life events\u201d that allow an insurance seeker to enroll at any point during the year.\n\n\u201cThis legislation will help expectant mothers get access to essential prenatal care and help build a stronger and healthier New York,\u201d Cuomo said in a statement.\n\nThe change applies to insurance plans offered through New York State of Health, the state\u2019s insurance marketplace set up under the federal Affordable Care Act. Previously, women could enroll in an insurance plan after a birth, but the new law allows it at any point during the preceding pregnancy.\n\nAbout 2.1 million people have enrolled in insurance plans over the past two years through the marketplace, which is the state\u2019s tool for connecting providers with those seeking coverage. The vast majority \u2014 about 1.4 million \u2014 have been enrolled in Medicaid plans.\n\nThe pregnancy measure was hailed by women\u2019s organizations and pro-choice groups, with NARAL Pro-Choice New York calling it \u201cgroundbreaking.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis legislation will expand access to maternity care, including prenatal visits, labor, and delivery, and improve the health of women and children throughout our state,\u201d said Andrea Miller, the group\u2019s president.\n\nThe state marketplace\u2019s open-enrollment period is currently ongoing, with insurance seekers having until Jan. 31 to enroll in coverage for 2016.\n\nThe bill was sponsored by Sen. James Seward, R-Milford, Otsego County, and Assemblywoman Aravella Simotas, D-Queens.\n\nSeward said the new law \u201crectifies yet another major gap in the federal Affordable Care Act,\u201d which many refer to as \u201cObamacare.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis legislation will erase at least one concern and provide moms-to-be with some peace of mind,\u201d he said.\n\nJCAMPBELL1@gannett.com\n\nTwitter.com/JonCampbellGAN\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.rocne.ws/1OvpC3X", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "New York becomes the first state to declare pregnancy a life-changing event.", "og": {"site_name": "Rochester Democrat and Chronicle", "description": "New York becomes the first state to declare pregnancy a life-changing event.", "title": "Pregnant women gain insurance flexibility in NY", "url": "http://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/local/2015/12/28/preganancy-health-insurance-option-enrollement-new-york-state/77990232/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/democratandchronicle.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "New York becomes the first state to declare pregnancy a life-changing event.", "title": "Pregnant women gain insurance flexibility in NY", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9414fa943c6f6a1b1751fdb856873017bd74c3b9/c=376-0-1792-1416&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/12/28/Rochester/B9320288045Z.1_20151228180130_000_G30D0GDKJ.2-0.jpg", "creator": "@DandC", "site": "@DandC", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600028377", "fb": {"app_id": 176958652324613}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Subjects/Affordable Care Act", "gci-asset-type": "Story", "gci-categories": "Subjects/Affordable Care Act", "title": "Pregnant women gain insurance flexibility in NY", "author": "Jon Campbell Albany Bureau", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/local", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d384be58fb3c26b99374ef24cc414ef1ab9d88c9/c=466-0-1528-1416/local/-/media/2015/12/28/Rochester/B9320288045Z.1_20151228180130_000_G30D0GDKJ.2-0.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/cff74c0c02641a846572a3b471ccc171627718b1/c=376-0-1792-1416/local/-/media/2015/12/28/Rochester/B9320288045Z.1_20151228180130_000_G30D0GDKJ.2-0.jpg", "contenttype": "Story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d4460270ff39f10ff1d863d461e5f81c4f38711f/c=118-0-2006-1416/local/-/media/2015/12/28/Rochester/B9320288045Z.1_20151228180130_000_G30D0GDKJ.2-0.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b1fb1aa683e1f74d1e75c28a17eab9d4ba1ea362/c=0-121-2121-1319&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/12/28/Rochester/B9320288045Z.1_20151228180130_000_G30D0GDKJ.2-0.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-12-28T18:08:36.227000-05:00", "shorthed": "Pregnant women gain insurance option", "articleid": 77990232, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c7edc48fda6bfe27c0126d24d96f2efabf53d8b7/c=0-121-2121-1319/local/-/media/2015/12/28/Rochester/B9320288045Z.1_20151228180130_000_G30D0GDKJ.2-0.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7ce1cf24b24e56c2079028cc9aa02b4c1dd59004/c=757-0-1550-1416/local/-/media/2015/12/28/Rochester/B9320288045Z.1_20151228180130_000_G30D0GDKJ.2-0.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": "preganancy, health insurance, option, enrollement, New York state"}, "article_summary": "(Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto)ALBANY - Pregnant women will soon get more flexibility to receive health insurance coverage in New York state.\nThe change applies to insurance plans offered through New York State of Health, the state\u2019s insurance marketplace set up under the federal Affordable Care Act.\nPreviously, women could enroll in an insurance plan after a birth, but the new law allows it at any point during the preceding pregnancy.\nOn Jan. 1, New York will become the first state to allow women to sign up for the state\u2019s health exchange at any time during a pregnancy.\nThe state marketplace\u2019s open-enrollment period is currently ongoing, with insurance seekers having until Jan. 31 to enroll in coverage for 2016."}
