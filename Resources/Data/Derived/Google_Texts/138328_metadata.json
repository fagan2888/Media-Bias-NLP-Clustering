While profits and private contributions are waning, government assistance rose by $25.3 million in the past year.\n\n\u201cThis was definitely a bad year for Planned Parenthood as a business,\u201d Jamie Hall, a senior policy analyst in the Center for Data Analysis at The Heritage Foundation told The Daily Signal. \u201cThey lost a significant share of their patients, provided fewer actual medical services, spent far more money on other things, made less profit, and became even more dependent on government funding.\u201d\n\nAbortions conducted by the group also dropped from 327,653 in 2014 to 323,999 in 2015.\n\nPlanned Parenthood released its 2014-15 annual report in late December. Upon its release, Hall compared its numbers to those of the previous year.\n\nThe claimed number of patients served dropped from 2.7 to 2.5 million. The number of abortions dropped from 327,653 to 323,999, a 1.1 percent decrease. The number of total \u201cmedical services\u201d dropped from 10,590,433 to 9,455,582, a 10.7 percent decrease. Abortions rose from 3.1 percent to 3.4 percent of \u201cmedical services.\u201d Total revenue dropped from $1.3034 billion to $1.2961 billion, a 0.6 percent decrease. Private contributions and bequests fell from $391.8 million to $353.5 million, a 9.8 percent decrease. Government revenue rose from $528.4 million to $553.7 million, a 4.8 percent increase. The government share of total revenue increased from 40.5 to 42.7 percent. Total expenses rose from $1.1763 billion to $1.2373 billion, a 5.2 percent increase. \u201cMedical services\u201d expenses rose from $769.1 million to $782.3 million, a 1.7 percent increase. The rest of Planned Parenthood\u2019s expenses therefore rose from $407.2 to $455 million, an 11.7 percent increase, including management and general expenses, which rose from $145.9 to $164.4 million, a 12.7 percent increase. Revenue in excess of expenses (i.e. \u201cprofit\u201d in almost any other context) fell from $127.1 million to $58.8 million, a 53.7 percent decline in one year.\n\nIn the report, Planned Parenthood also addressed a series of attacks that were triggered by a string of undercover videos produced by the Center for Medical Progress and its founder, David Daleiden.\n\n\u201cWe are at a critical moment in our history. Over the past several months, we have been tested in every way imaginable \u2014 and have emerged stronger than ever,\u201d Planned Parenthood wrote, referring to allegations that the organization profits off donated tissue harvested from aborted babies.\n\nNo one would bother attacking Planned Parenthood if we didn\u2019t matter. Planned Parenthood\u2019s resilient staff and clinicians are making a huge difference in the field of reproductive and sexual health care and in the cultural landscape at large.\n\nPlanned Parenthood, which has not yet responded to The Daily Signal\u2019s request for comment, has continually denied any illegal conduct.\n\nThe most recent annual report accounted for the organization\u2019s finances through June 30, 2015, and medical figures through Sept. 30, 2015. Because the first video in the Center for Medical Progress\u2019 series was released on July 14, 2015, Hall said the public would likely have to wait another year to measure their full impact.\n\n\u201cThe Center for Medical Progress videos were released relatively late in the Planned Parenthood fiscal year, so we will have to wait another 12 months to better understand their full impact,\u201d Hall said.\n\nAccording to the report, Planned Parenthood operates 661 health centers across the United States.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u201cThis was definitely a bad year for Planned Parenthood as a business.\"", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\u201cThis was definitely a bad year for Planned Parenthood as a business.\"", "title": "12 Key Numbers From Planned Parenthood\u2019s Annual Report", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/rtrlseven483663_PP_Report.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-01-08T22:58:16+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1UDi7pW"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\u201cThis was definitely a bad year for Planned Parenthood as a business.\"", "title": "12 Key Numbers From Planned Parenthood\u2019s Annual Report", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/rtrlseven483663_PP_Report.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "Protecting Life", "published_time": "2016-01-08T17:26:29+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-08T22:58:16+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "planned parenthood, planned parenthood annual report, planned parenthood 2015 report, abortion, planned parenthood abortion, abortion, fetal tissue donation, cecile richards"}, "article_summary": "According to the report, Planned Parenthood operates 661 health centers across the United States.\nPlanned Parenthood, which has not yet responded to The Daily Signal\u2019s request for comment, has continually denied any illegal conduct.\nPlanned Parenthood released its 2014-15 annual report in late December.\nThe number of total \u201cmedical services\u201d dropped from 10,590,433 to 9,455,582, a 10.7 percent decrease.\nNo one would bother attacking Planned Parenthood if we didn\u2019t matter."}
