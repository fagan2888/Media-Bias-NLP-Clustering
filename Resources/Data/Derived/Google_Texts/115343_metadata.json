Even if the bragging rights outweigh the tangible impacts of one congressional race, the two sides see the contest as a potential harbinger, particularly on the health care law. The stakes are particularly high for Democrats, who are on the defensive nationwide over the issue, and who put forward a strong candidate in Ms. Sink, an early favorite in this race.\n\nThe district, which includes Clearwater and most of St. Petersburg, is 87 percent white and has a high proportion of older voters.\n\nDodging the blizzard of political messages is no longer an option. One moment, a flier pillories Ms. Sink as \u201cnot one of us\u201d and a narrator on television calls her a lackey for President Obama and his health care law, which will lead to \u201ccanceled health plans, higher premiums, Medicare cuts,\u201d according to an ad from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n\nThe next moment, an ad from a Democratic political action committee shows an office in Washington, where \u201cDavid Jolly lobbied for a special interest that wanted to privatize Social Security,\u201d and adds that he \u201cstill says privatization should be on the table.\u201d\n\nNeither position is wholly accurate. Ms. Sink, 65, supports the Affordable Care Act but has said she would work to fix it rather than repeal it. And Mr. Jolly, 41, said that while he and his firm, Three Bridges Advisors, lobbied in 2009 for Free Enterprise Nation, a group dedicated to controlling \u201cunsustainable\u201d government spending, he did not lobby on that issue.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe group\u2019s chief executive, James MacDougald, a businessman, is a strong advocate for privatizing Social Security and co-chairman of Mr. Jolly\u2019s finance team. Mr. Jolly said the program should remain untouched for workers who have paid in at least 10 years but must be re-evaluated for the rest, with all options on the table, including allowing private accounts.\n\nPhoto\n\nSo far, conservative groups have outspent liberals in an attempt to blunt Ms. Sink\u2019s considerable fund-raising advantage, spending $5 million on ads that oppose her, compared with $3,7 million by liberal groups, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. In the past six weeks, Ms. Sink has raised $1.3 million, a prodigious sum for a special election and double the amount raised by Mr. Jolly.\n\nMr. Jolly\u2019s lackluster fund-raising and at times uncertain campaign \u2014 he was not the first choice of party leaders looking for a candidate to take on Ms. Sink \u2014 have left some Republicans nervous about his chances. Still, polls show that the race has tightened. Ms. Sink, a former bank executive, was narrowly ahead, but Republicans usually turn out in higher numbers for special elections, something that Ms. Sink has tried to diminish with an intense absentee and early-voting effort.\n\nMs. Sink, who lost the governor\u2019s race in 2010 to Gov. Rick Scott by one percentage point, is well known throughout the state. And while her moderate stances and business background are a boon in the district, her low-key nature does not tend to rev up a room. Still, many see her as genuine, and she has made efforts to reach out to older voters.\n\n\u201cShe has the brains and the integrity,\u201d said Helen Emrick, 89, part of a group that gathered to support Ms. Sink at the Palms of Largo, an independent- and assisted-living center. \u201cJolly has the charisma and the good looks,\u201d Ms. Emrick added, but \u201che\u2019s a politician. She\u2019s a real person.\u201d\n\nAs Ms. Sink mingled with residents at the center, complimenting one woman\u2019s jacket and thanking another for her support, she emphasized her traditional upbringing on a farm in North Carolina. Then, with her twang, she homed in on Social Security.\n\n\u201cSocial Security is not an entitlement program,\u201d Ms. Sink told the senior citizens, a group she is assiduously wooing. \u201cWe earned it. We paid into it.\u201d\n\nNot too far away, on Madeira Beach, Mr. Jolly squinted into the sun on a dock with charter fishermen looking on and argued for less fisheries regulation. \u201cThis is about protecting the quality of life in Pinellas and growing our economy,\u201d he said.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Jolly, who had been a senior aide to Mr. Young, is campaigning heavily as Mr. Young\u2019s natural successor. His smooth style and grasp of the issues have helped bolster his standing in the polls.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s articulate, he\u2019s smart and runs a great campaign,\u201d said Fred Piccolo Jr., a Republican political consultant who grew up in the district. \u201cHis Achilles\u2019 heel is that he was lobbying for as long as he was.\u201d\n\nBut Mr. Jolly has shifted to the right on some issues, a potential problem in this moderate district, political analysts said. During one debate, he said he would advocate the repeal of Roe v. Wade. Questioned about Syria, he responded that Mr. Obama should have intervened, a contentious position in an area with so many veterans.\n\n\u201cIt surprised a lot of people how conservative Jolly went in the debates, and it gave Sink an opening,\u201d Mr. Piccolo said.\n\nFor the most part, though, Mr. Jolly and Republicans have focused on the Affordable Care Act, with few other issues gaining as much traction against Ms. Sink, Mr. Piccolo said. Mr. Jolly\u2019s depiction of Ms. Sink as a carpetbagger may have done some damage, too; Ms. Sink moved to Pinellas from a neighboring county several months ago. Questions have also been raised about the depth of Mr. Jolly\u2019s ties to the district.\n\nAlthough not nearly as visible, Mr. Overby, 27, the Libertarian candidate, may pose problems for both Ms. Sink and Mr. Jolly. A commercial diving supervisor, he could lure enough discontented voters away to make a difference.\n\n\u201cHe a candidate of the future for young people,\u201d said Susan MacManus, a professor of political science at the University of South Florida. \u201cWe just don\u2019t know how much he is going to drain off.\u201d\n\nNo matter who wins, there will be little time to celebrate. The next election is eight months away.\n\n\u201cThis is the warm-up,\u201d said David Beattie, a Democratic pollster. \u201cWhoever wins is going right back in, whether it\u2019s the same opponent or not.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140308172931, "twitter": {"description": "Both Republicans and Democrats see the special election Tuesday as a potential harbinger, particularly with regards to the Affordable Care Act.", "title": "Florida Election a Crash Course for Midterm Races", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/09/us/politics/florida-election-a-crash-course-for-midterm-races.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002738437"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "creator": "LizetteNYT", "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/09/us/FLORIDA-1/FLORIDA-1-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/09/us/politics/florida-election-a-crash-course-for-midterm-races.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002738437", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/09/us/politics/florida-election-a-crash-course-for-midterm-races.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us/politics", "hdl_p": "Florida Election a Crash Course for Midterm Races", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/politics/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "March 8, 2014", "edt": "NewYork", "keywords": "Florida,Elections  House of Representatives,Jolly  David,Sink  Adelaide Alexander,Overby  Lucas,Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010)", "news_keywords": "Florida", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Lizette Alvarez", "SCG": "politics", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Overby, Lucas", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By LIZETTE ALVAREZ", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Both Republicans and Democrats see the special election Tuesday as a potential harbinger, particularly with regards to the Affordable Care Act.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/09/us/FLORIDA-1/FLORIDA-1-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "Both Republicans and Democrats see the special election Tuesday as a potential harbinger, particularly with regards to the Affordable Care Act.", "CG": "us", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "March 8, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/a/lizette_alvarez/index.html", "section": "Politics", "modified": "2014-03-12", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/politics/index.jsonp", "tag": "Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010)", "published": "2014-03-08", "section-taxonomy-id": "23FD6C8B-62D5-4CEA-A331-6C2A9A1223BE"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "geo": "Florida", "slug": "09florida", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20140312161831, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/09/us/politics/florida-election-a-crash-course-for-midterm-races.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/09/us/FLORIDA-1/FLORIDA-1-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Both Republicans and Democrats see the special election Tuesday as a potential harbinger, particularly with regards to the Affordable Care Act.", "title": "Florida Election a Crash Course for Midterm Races"}, "pdate": 20140308, "des": "Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010)", "articleid": 100000002738437, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Florida Election a Crash Course for Midterm Races", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/09/us/FLORIDA-1/FLORIDA-1-thumbLarge.jpg", "PST": "News"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe15ee\"", "article_summary": "Sink has raised $1.3 million, a prodigious sum for a special election and double the amount raised by Mr. Jolly.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main storyThe group\u2019s chief executive, James MacDougald, a businessman, is a strong advocate for privatizing Social Security and co-chairman of Mr. Jolly\u2019s finance team.\nSink and Mr. Jolly.\nSink, Mr. Piccolo said.\nQuestions have also been raised about the depth of Mr. Jolly\u2019s ties to the district."}
