The award-winning feature will play January 6, 2015 at 8:00pm at the historic Rustic Theatre, followed by the Opening Night Gala of the festival. The film screens again as part of the festival\u2019s weekend programming, Friday January 9th at 6:00pm, also at the Rustic Theatre, followed by the highly-anticipated digitally remastered Beatle\u2019s film \u201cA Hard Day\u2019s Night.\u201d\n\n\u201cRon and Laura Take Back America\u201d is a mockumentary satire that follows in the footsteps of such films of Christopher Guest as \u201cBest in Show\u201d and \u201cWaiting for Guffman\u201d. Written and directed by its co-stars, the comedy team of Mel England (\u201cLittle Big Top\u201d) and Janice Markham (\u201cGrandma Sylvia\u2019s Funeral\u201d), the film also stars Golden Globe\u00ae Best Actress Nominee Irene Bedard (\u201cInto the West\u201d), Jim J. Bullock (\u201cThe New Hollywood Squares\u201d), and features a celebrity cameo by Academy Award\u00ae Best Actress Nominee Sally Kirkland. The film is executive produced by Sue Vaccaro (Tony\u00ae winning producer for \u201cClybourne Park\u201d).\n\n\u201cWe are honored that our \u201cRon and Laura\u201d was chosen as the opening film of the IIFC\u201d, says Vaccaro. She adds, \"With 7 awards and nominations under our belt from the festival circuit, we hope to be the highlight of the festival.\u201d\n\nThe film is indeed on a festival winning streak, having won four awards at the Indie Fest USA International Film Festival in September, including \u201cBest Comedy,\u201d \u201cBest of Festival,\" \u201cBest Director\u201d (England & Markham) and \u201cBest Actress\u201d (Markham). Earlier in 2014, the film also won \u201cBest Comedy\u201d at the New York City International Film Festival, and earned nominations for \u201cBest US Narrative Feature\u201d and \u201cBest Actor\u201d (England).\n\n\"Ron and Laura Take Back America\u201d follows the exploits of a conservative suburban couple who decide to take their country back from Obamacare, Immigration Reform, Gay Marriage... and Hollywood Health Food Nuts! A modern day \"All in the Family,\" the film is a funny, sometimes poignant, look at a family divided by the contemporary political issues of our time. When Ron and Laura decide to film their protests, the \u201cculture wars\u201d land right in their own back yard -- they find out their son is gay, and they lose their health insurance! \u201cRon and Laura Take Back America\u201d draws its humor from sometimes painful realities, and sometimes, just plain silly wacky comedy!\n\nOne of the film\u2019s stars and producers, Irene Bedard, known to audiences worldwide as the voice of Disney\u2019s \u201cPocahontas\u201d as well as playing ground-breaking roles in over forty films, has relished her involvement with the IIFC. Bedard is also the director of Idyllwild\u2019s Native Film Studies Program, in its first year at the festival. She states, \u201cI am very grateful to festival director Stephen Savage for creating the Native Studies Program. He always takes bold chances in programming.\u201d She adds, \u201cCase in point, \"Ron and Laura Take Back America\" is a film that not only is unique and daring as a political satire - but it\u2019s also hilarious!\u201d\n\nAbout Idyllwild International Festival of Cinema\n\nThe Idyllwild International Festival of Cinema (IIFC) is an annual, competitive, independent film and arts festival held every January in Idyllwild, California.
