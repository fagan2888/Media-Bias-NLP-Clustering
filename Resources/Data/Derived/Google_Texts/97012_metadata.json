Readings above 50 signal that builders, generally, are optimistic about sales trends, and September marks the third consecutive month of above-50 readings.\n\nA strengthening jobs market is perking up builders, though there are still major headwinds from strict credit standards, among other factors.\n\nConfidence among home builders is running higher than levels historically seen at recent building rates for new homes. On Thursday, markets will get an even clearer picture of the housing trend as the government reports on new home construction. Economists polled by MarketWatch expect to find out that the pace of construction slowed in August.\n\nThere is reason for optimism. Economists are forecasting faster sales and construction of new homes as the economy adds jobs at a healthy rate. Also, mortgage rates remain relatively low, making financing relatively affordable.\n\nHowever, not all borrowers are able to take advantage of cheap mortgages. Years after the financial meltdown lenders\u2019 loan standards are still so high that some creditworthy borrowers haven\u2019t been able to get a mortgage. Also, the number of borrowers, who can afford home loans, has shrunk due to rapidly rising house prices over the past year.\n\nData details from Wednesday\u2019s report showed that NAHB\u2019s gauge of builders\u2019 views on coming sales of single-family homes rose 2 points to 67 in September, while a barometer of builders\u2019 views on present sales rose 5 points to 63, and a gauge of prospective-buyer traffic increased 5 points to 47.\n\n\u201cThe data continue to suggest that the housing recovery is back on track,\u201d said Jim O\u2019Sullivan, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics.\n\nEarly Wednesday, Lennar LEN, -0.09% one of the top U.S. home builders, reported fiscal third-quarter earnings and revenue that jumped up from the year-earlier period. The most recent report from the government on new single-family homes throughout the U.S. showed that the sales pace fell to a four-month low in July.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting, however that single-family home data series is volatile, and sales could point higher in coming reports.\n\nMore from MarketWatch", "article_metadata": {"lifp_basePath": "https://id.marketwatch.com/access", "twitter": {"domain": "marketwatch.com", "description": "A gauge of confidence among home builders rose in September to the highest level in almost nine years, as builders\u2019 views on present and upcoming sales rose.", "creator": "@RuthMantell", "image": {"width": 1320, "identifier": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-CU281_HMI091_ZG_20140917103822.jpg", "height": 742}, "site": {"id": 624413}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.content_group": "marketwatch", "parsely-author": "Ruth Mantell", "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-pub-date": "2014-09-17T11:39:00-04:00", "parsely-link": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/home-builder-confidence-highest-in-almost-nine-years-2014-09-17-101032814", "author": "Ruth Mantell", "parsely-title": "Home-builder confidence hits highest mark in years", "description": "A gauge of confidence among home builders rose in September to the highest level in almost nine years, as builders\u2019 views on present and upcoming sales rose.", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=336693422", "article.section": "Economy & Politics", "page.site": "marketwatch", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 283204329838}, "parsely-section": "MW_Economy & Politics", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "og": {"site_name": "MarketWatch", "description": "A gauge of confidence among home builders rose in September to the highest level in almost nine years, as builders\u2019 views on present and upcoming sales rose.", "title": "Home-builder confidence hits highest mark in years", "url": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/home-builder-confidence-highest-in-almost-nine-years-2014-09-17-101032814", "image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-CU281_HMI091_ZG_20140917103822.jpg", "type": "article"}, "ob": {"image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-CU281_HMI091_ZG_20140917103822.jpg"}, "article.id": "03A4F4D0-3E73-11E4-976D-A64A5D2F6737", "position": 1}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1232\"", "article_summary": "WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) \u2014 A gauge of confidence among home builders rose in September to the highest level in almost nine years, as builders\u2019 views on present and coming sales rose, according to data released Wednesday.\nThe overall gauge of builder sentiment rose 4 points to 59 in September, according to National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo.\nConfidence among home builders is running higher than levels historically seen at recent building rates for new homes.\nIt\u2019s worth noting, however that single-family home data series is volatile, and sales could point higher in coming reports.\nThe most recent report from the government on new single-family homes throughout the U.S. showed that the sales pace fell to a four-month low in July."}
