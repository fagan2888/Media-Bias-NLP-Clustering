(Photo by Steve Jennings/Getty Images for TechCrunch via flickr)\n\nElizabeth Holmes, founder and CEO of Theranos, says her company\u2019s plan to disrupt the diagnostic testing industry is moving ahead, despite skeptics\u2019 concerns over the sustainability of the model and risks of over-testing.\n\nHolmes, speaking at the annual America's Health Insurance Plans Institute meeting in Nashville last week, claimed direct-to-consumer laboratory testing and price transparency are an integral piece of health reform and a solution to America\u2019s disease and cost problems.\n\n\u201cWe have to provide direct access to testing, to facilitate a new era of individual-physician partnership around preventative care,\u201d said Holmes, a 31-year-old self-made microbiologist and billionaire.\n\n[Also: Cleveland Clinic taps Theranos, bets on cheaper diagnostics]\n\nTheranos technology requires a small drop of blood from a fingertip\u2014not a vial from a vein\u2014to screen for hundreds of conditions, with everything limited at half of what Medicare reimburses. \u201cGreat change is possible and we can build a system that is transparent, engages consumers and embraces scientific advancement,\u201d Holmes said.\n\nPeople in Palo Alto, California, where Theranos is based, and across Arizona can order one of its tests online or in-person at a Walgreens, see the results themselves and share them with doctors. The Cleveland Clinic is also partnering with Theranos to study and possibly use the diagnostic technology in its patient services.\n\nWhile over-testing is a concern, Homes said many American patients actually don\u2019t follow through and receive tests ordered by a doctor. \u201cSome can\u2019t afford the tests, the locations and hours for lab testing can make tests inaccessible for those who do not have the means to take time away from work,\u201d she said. \u201cToday, most people have to go to an emergency room to get a lab test late at night or on a weekend. An additional barrier is fear of needles, a basic human fear.\u201d\n\nSo far, Theranos has drawn a $9 billion valuation and a board including Bill Frist, MD, of the Hospital Corp. of America\u2019s founding family, economist George Shultz and former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. If Theranos goes according to Holmes\u2019 plan, receiving blood-based health tests will be much more convenient, affordable, safe and frequent. A large swath of the current lab industry could also be put out of business.\n\nMeanwhile, the issue of diagnostic accuracy issue ,looms over Theranos from critics in the lab industry and scientists who point out that the company hasn\u2019t published peer reviews of its technology.\n\n[Also: Clinical diagnostic lab testing market to almost double through 2017]\n\nHolmes said that the Food & Drug Administration should be the ultimate scrutinizer.\n\n\u201cWe are not required to [submit tests to the FDA] but we have made this commitment because we believe that FDA oversight plays a critical role in ensuring that individuals and their physicians get the most accurate test results.\u201d\n\nBarriers to the patient-consumer\n\nWhile some direct-to-patient lab tests are available in many places through Theranos forerunners like Direct Labs, 20 states limit or prohibit the ability for residents to get their own lab tests, according to Holmes. Thirteen states require a physician's\u2019 pre-authorization and 9 only allow a certain number of tests.\n\nThese are \u201ctremendous impediments to critical, life-saving data,\u201d Holmes said, adding that until recently people weren\u2019t even guaranteed access to their test results.\n\nAccess to over-the-counter HIV tests has helped control the AIDS epidemic through early detection, Holmes said, and the same principle could help address diabetes, the seventh-leading contributor to death in the U.S. As many as 8 million Americans are estimated to have undiagnosed diabetes, and those adults with have a 50 percent higher risk of death, with the risk of developing cardiovascular disease and diabetes complications, Holmes said.\n\nNational model\n\nRecently, Theranos has made a foray into public policy to help design what Holmes considers the ideal system to empower and serve patients in their health. In July, a new takes effect in Arizona that \u201cfor the first time in our country allows Arizonans to obtain and pay for any laboratory test they want without a written authorization from a healthcare provider and that provides complete indemnification for physicians around the results, so they can fully engage with their patients on preventive testing,\u201d Holmes said.\n\nLike Healthcare Finance on Facebook\n\n\u201cThis simple new law can serve as a model for our nation and is essential to the creation of modern healthcare system focused on preventative care,\u201d she argued. \"The lack of engagement of the consumer has a profound effect on the market itself: There is no pressure for prices to drop. Every person should know how much a test will cost them before that test is done.\"\n\nAmericans will become more attuned to the costs of testing with more direct-to-consumer testing by Theranos and others, and that \u201ctransparency will drive pricing down, reducing their healthcare costs,\u201d Holmes said.\n\n\u201cTests that were once only accessible as confirmatory tests due to costs become accessible to provide more actionable information,\u201d she said. \u201cThose lower costs will help Medicare, Medicaid and private payers achieve greater savings, and advances in science and technology will multiply if consumer demand fuels a market for better services at lower cost, like every other industry where the market functions.\u201d\n\nTwitter: @AnthonyBrino", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/theranos-ceo-props-testing-model-ahip-targets-states-blocking-access", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/TechCrunch-photo-Flickr-feature.gif", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "Entrepreneur claims direct-to-consumer laboratory testing and price transparency are an integral piece of health reform and a solution to America's disease and cost problems.", "title": "Theranos CEO props up testing model at AHIP, targets states blocking access"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/TechCrunch-photo-Flickr-feature.gif"}, "title": "Theranos CEO props up testing model at AHIP, targets states blocking access", "description": "Entrepreneur claims direct-to-consumer laboratory testing and price transparency are an integral piece of health reform and a solution to America's disease and cost problems.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@HC_Finance"}, "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no", "description": "Elizabeth Holmes, founder and CEO of Theranos, says her company\u2019s plan to disrupt the diagnostic testing industry is moving ahead, despite skeptics\u2019 concerns over the sustainability of the model and risks of over-testing.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "[Also: Clinical diagnostic lab testing market to almost double through 2017]Holmes said that the Food & Drug Administration should be the ultimate scrutinizer.\n\u201cToday, most people have to go to an emergency room to get a lab test late at night or on a weekend.\nIf Theranos goes according to Holmes\u2019 plan, receiving blood-based health tests will be much more convenient, affordable, safe and frequent.\nA large swath of the current lab industry could also be put out of business.\nAmericans will become more attuned to the costs of testing with more direct-to-consumer testing by Theranos and others, and that \u201ctransparency will drive pricing down, reducing their healthcare costs,\u201d Holmes said."}
