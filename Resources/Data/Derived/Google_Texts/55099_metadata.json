Overall, about 8 percent of people who signed up for coverage through the exchange did so through an in-person assister, according to a survey of Access Health customers. And a relatively small percentage of the assisters were responsible for the bulk of those sign-ups.\n\nThis year\u2019s effort will center on having 20 \u201coutposts\u201d where people can get information and sign up during fixed hours. The outposts will be staffed by 20 to 30 people hired by Access Health and located in libraries, Department of Labor offices and sites run by community organizations in areas with high levels of uninsured residents.\n\nAccess Health will also continue to run two storefronts in New Britain and New Haven.\n\nJason Madrak, the exchange\u2019s chief marketing officer, said last year\u2019s experience made clear the importance of having assistance available during consistent hours throughout the week, in visible and public locations. Last year, some in-person assisters were only available during brief windows of time each week, making it hard for potential customers to meet with them, he said.\n\nMadrak said having set locations will also make it easier for people to find places to get help enrolling, particularly if they don't have access to a computer. Last year, the exchange had a database people could use to find a nearby assister, but for people without access to technology, Madrak said, \"it was almost impossible for them to go and look somebody up in that database.\u201d\n\nBut critics of the plan worry it won\u2019t be enough. Alta Lash, executive director of United Connecticut Action for Neighborhoods, said it was hard to imagine the new model would be effective in reaching the uninsured, who she described as being unconnected and unlikely to seek out insurance.\n\n\u201cYou are relying, in this model, on people coming to you,\u201d she said Monday, during a meeting of the exchange\u2019s consumer experience and outreach committee.\n\nMadrak said the exchange is meeting with civic and religious leaders in areas with high numbers of uninsured residents so they can help encourage people to go to the enrollment outposts. \u201cIt\u2019s a push and pull system,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile the previous enrollment effort was funded through $2.7 million in federal grants, federal money isn\u2019t available this year. And exchange officials anticipate different challenges: The enrollment period is three months -- Nov. 15 through Feb. 15 -- instead of six, as it was last time. In addition to trying to find new customers, Access Health now must also try to retain its current customers. More than 50,000 state residents have individual-market health plans that are expected to be discontinued by the end of the year, a potential new group of customers for the exchange. And those who remain uninsured could be harder to reach than those who signed up during the previous round.\n\nThe exchange anticipates spending about $353,000 on the enrollment outposts, including staffing, training and items such as signs and tablecloths.\n\nTo supplement the effort, the Connecticut Health Foundation, the Hartford Foundation for Public Giving, and the Foundation for Community Health plan to fund about 35 outreach workers who will receive training and support from Access Health. The foundations plan to fund people that were effective assisters during the previous enrollment period.\n\nElizabeth Krause, vice president of policy and communications at the Connecticut Health Foundation, said they believe in-person assistance is essential to the enrollment system.\n\n\u201cWe believe it\u2019s not the only way, of course, that people get enrollment support, but that especially for underserved populations, populations of color, populations with mental illness, in-person assistance is incredibly important and it\u2019s something that we can\u2019t let go of just yet,\u201d Krause said.\n\nThe Connecticut Health Foundation plans to provide about 20 organizations with grants of $5,000 to conduct what Krause called \u201cshoe-leather, community-based in-person assistance.\u201d The Hartford Foundation for Public Giving will fund outreach efforts in the Hartford area, while the Foundation for Community Health will fund an effort in the Northwest part of the state.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s limited, but it will get another 35 people out there to help with this very important effort,\u201d Krause said.\n\nIn addition to the storefronts, outposts and foundation-funded assisters, people can also sign up for coverage online, through the Access Health call center, through staff at community health centers and hospitals, and insurance agents and brokers.", "article_metadata": {"standout": "http://ctmirror.org/2014/10/07/foundations-chip-in-to-help-people-sign-up-for-obamacare/", "news_keywords": "Health Care, Access Health CT, Affordable Care Act, Obamacare", "original-source": "http://ctmirror.org/2014/10/07/foundations-chip-in-to-help-people-sign-up-for-obamacare/", "og": {"site_name": "The CT Mirror", "description": "Three foundations plan to pay for about 35 people to conduct \u201cshoe-leather\u201d outreach to help Connecticut residents sign up for Obamacare during the open enrollment that begins Nov. 15.
