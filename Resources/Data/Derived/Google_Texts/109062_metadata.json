The deal establishes Russia\u2019s presence in the heart of the biggest Asian market.\n\nBut the geopolitical triumphs have been bittersweet. Russia\u2019s economy is widely believed to have sunk into recession as a result of Western sanctions imposed in response to Mr. Putin\u2019s takeover of Crimea and the investor stampede out of Russia caused by his Ukrainian land grab.\n\nMr. Putin may have given a final push to clinch the long-stalled gas deal with an eye on the Russian economy. Russian energy giant Gazprom plans to spend $55 billion and hire 11,700 people to build the pipelines, gas processing plants and other infrastructure needed to make good on what Mr. Putin said would be the world\u2019s largest infrastructure project.\n\n\u201cI guess China never got the sanctions memo,\u201d said Max Keiser, a former Wall Street trader and British broadcaster.\n\nHe said the $400 billion, 30-year deal will further the strategic goals of Moscow and Beijing to diminish the status of the U.S. dollar by conducting world trade in critical commodities such as oil and gas using other currencies.\n\nRussia is the world\u2019s biggest producer of commodities such as crude oil, gold and titanium. China is the world\u2019s biggest consumer of these commodities.\n\nBoth countries have chafed for years at having to conduct purchases and sales in dollars, as is customary worldwide. The gas deal announced in Beijing on Wednesday would be the first major commodities contract to be settled in Russian rubles and Chinese yuan rather than dollars.\n\n\u201cThis means the U.S. dollar\u2019s days as the world reserve currency are numbered,\u201d said Mr. Keiser, noting that Russia and China have been investing heavily in gold.\n\nMany analysts question whether Moscow and Beijing can succeed in displacing the dollar as the world\u2019s reserve currency. If that happens, however, it likely would usher in a period of global financial instability and force Americans to pay much more for the massive amounts of imported energy, Mr. Keiser said.\n\nSome reports said Russia had to accept a lower price for gas, $360 per 1,000 cubic meters, than the $380 originally sought from China. Mr. Keiser said the strategic gains for Russia were well worth any short-term financial sacrifice.\n\nStrategic competitor\n\nConstantin Gurdgiev, an analyst at True Economics, said the deal was a mutual win for energy-rich Russia and its energy-hungry neighbor while posing significant strategic competition for the U.S. and its allies.\n\n\u201cAll across, this should be a very good deal for Russia and China,\u201d he said.\n\nThe deal settles on a way to build a pipeline network from western Siberia, northeastern China and Russia\u2019s east coast, and will carry 38 billion cubic meters of gas a year to China. Russia has needed such a structure for years to sell its gas in the Far East.\n\nThe project, which will be built jointly, will make Russia\u2019s gas available for the first time to China and carry it most of the way to Russia\u2019s Pacific ports, where it can be liquefied and sold to Japan, South Korea and other lucrative Asian markets.\n\nRussia has been searching for decades for ways to finance and build links to the Far East. Once the pipelines to China are in place, Gazprom plans to expand the network and use it to exploit and transport what energy analysts say is a vast untapped pool of oil and gas in mostly unexplored eastern Siberia.\n\n\u201cThe new pipeline holds the promise of bringing exploration and production further east from existing centers of production\u201d in western Siberia and unlocking potentially large oil and gas fields in the Russian Far East, Mr. Gurdgiev said.\n\nGazprom envisions a steady flow of gas that would feed a liquefied natural gas plant in Vladivostok on Russia\u2019s eastern coast, which would funnel liquefied gas to the rest of Asia, including major port cities in China.\n\n\u201cThe core threat here is to the U.S. exports of LNG to the Asia-Pacific, where U.S. producers are collecting huge margins compared to European markets,\u201d Mr. Gurdgiev said. \u201cBut this threat is still some years, if not decades, off from becoming a significant pressure point\u201d because the Russian pipeline network and most U.S. liquefied gas terminals are years from being completed.\n\nMoody\u2019s Investors Service Vice President Julia Pribytkova said Gazprom will have to take on a lot of debt to complete the project, but it should be worth it in the end. \u201cThe deal will provide a launchpad for Gazprom\u2019s full-scale diversification into the Asia-Pacific region,\u201d the biggest and fastest-growing market for natural gas worldwide, she said.\n\nThe Ukraine link\n\nTyler Durden, an analyst at Zero Hedge, said the Russian-Chinese deal represents a big strategic loss for the U.S., despite efforts by the Obama administration to minimize its importance.\n\nSecretary of State John F. Kerry insisted last week that the deal was not linked to the standoff in Ukraine, but Mr. Durden said the U.S. and Europe, in attempts to isolate Moscow, virtually \u201cforced Russia into China\u2019s embrace.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is merely the beginning of what will be a far closer commercial and political relationship between China and Russia,\u201d Mr. Durden said.\n\nChina used the announcement of the deal as an occasion to call for a security alliance of Russia, China and Iran \u2014 arguably the West\u2019s three most formidable opponents.\n\nWhile the U.S. and Europe were \u201cfuriously scrambling\u201d for ways to punish Russia for day-to-day developments in Ukraine, Mr. Durden said, the deal with China showed how Mr. Putin \u201conce again was thinking three steps ahead and quite a few steps to the east.\u201d\n\nRussia\u2019s \u201choly grail\u201d deal with China will \u201csend geopolitical shock waves around the world and bind the two nations in a commodity-backed axis,\u201d he said, while \u201claying the groundwork for a new joint, commodity-backed reserve currency that bypasses the dollar.\u201d\n\nAlthough Mr. Putin is reaping some long-term economic gains, the Russian economy has been a short-term loser in its standoff with the West.\n\nEconomic analysts say Russia\u2019s economy likely sank into recession this spring as a result of the exodus of investment funds in response to its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nMr. Putin seemed to acknowledge the dangers of cutting off all economic ties to the West, sparking a mild market rally after telling a gathering of corporate CEOs in St. Petersburg on Friday that Russia would not contest the weekend presidential vote in Ukraine. He also acknowledged that Western sanctions had cooled the business climate but said any effort to isolate Russia from the global economy would have a \u201cboomerang effect.\u201d\n\nWith the Chinese deal fresh in the business executives\u2019 minds, Mr. Putin said \u201cthe world is rapidly changing, and we are witnessing colossal geopolitical, technological and structural shifts.\u201d He said the United States is behind the curve in recognizing new global economic realities.\n\nBut Russia\u2019s gas deal with China promises to provide a substantial stimulus for the economy, especially in Russia\u2019s poorer regions in Siberia and the Far East where it is needed the most.\n\n\u201cAn extensive gas infrastructure network will be set up in Russia\u2019s east, which will drive the local economy forward,\u201d said Alexey Miller, Gazprom\u2019s chairman, emphasizing that nearly all the steel pipe and other components will be manufactured in Russia. \u201cGreat impetus will be given to entire economic sectors, namely metallurgy, pipe and machine building.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "In the tit-for-tat economic war between the United States and Russia this year, Moscow has scored a significant victory with its monumental deal to provide natural gas to China, directly challenging U.S. attempts to isolate Russia with economic sanctions.", "Author": "Patrice Hill", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "In the tit-for-tat economic war between the United States and Russia this year, Moscow has scored a significant victory with its monumental deal to provide natural gas to China, directly challenging U.S. attempts to isolate Russia with economic sanctions.", "title": "Russia\u2019s Putin gains strategic victory with Chinese natural gas deal", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/may/25/russias-putin-gains-strategic-victory-with-chinese/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/05/25/5_252014_china-russia-gas-deal8201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/05/25/5_252014_china-russia-gas-deal8201.jpg", "title": "Russia\u2019s Putin gains strategic victory with Chinese natural gas", "description": "In the tit-for-tat economic war between the United States and Russia this year, Moscow has scored a significant victory with its monumental deal to provide natural gas to China, directly challenging U", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Business Finance, Russia, China, Vladimir Putin, Moscow"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe105e\"", "article_summary": "By securing a major new customer for Russia\u2019s gas outside Europe, President Vladimir Putin has accomplished several top strategic goals.\nMr. Putin may have given a final push to clinch the long-stalled gas deal with an eye on the Russian economy.\nBut Russia\u2019s gas deal with China promises to provide a substantial stimulus for the economy, especially in Russia\u2019s poorer regions in Siberia and the Far East where it is needed the most.\nThe gas deal announced in Beijing on Wednesday would be the first major commodities contract to be settled in Russian rubles and Chinese yuan rather than dollars.\nThe deal establishes Russia\u2019s presence in the heart of the biggest Asian market."}
