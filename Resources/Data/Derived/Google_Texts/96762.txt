Bloomberg Energy costs fell 0.6% in November.

WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) — U.S. producer prices perked up in November led by the service sector, although they remain lower over the past year.

U.S. producer prices rose a seasonally adjusted 0.3% last month, the biggest gain since June, the Labor Department said Friday.Economists polled by MarketWatch had predicted a 0.1% rise in PPI.

Over the past 12 months, producer prices are 1.1% lower in unadjusted terms, compared with a 1.6% decline in October. That’s considered a more accurate barometer of wholesale price trends.

Excluding trade margins and the volatile categories of food and energy, core wholesale prices inched up 0.1% in November. Core price have risen a scant 0.3% over the past year.

The Federal Reserve is preparing to raise interest rates next week for the first time since rates bottomed out in 2009.

Some experts think the U.S. central bank is acting prematurely, seeing no evidence inflation is a danger to the economy.

Continuing recent trends, the gain in inflation in November came entirely from the service sector. Goods prices have fallen for five straight months.

In the service sector, wholesale costs rose 0.5% last month, the biggest increase since October 2014.

Trade margins increased 1.2% in November, seen by economists as erratic, also the biggest gain in 13 months.

Economists don’t believe the trade margin number, a relatively new category tracked by the government, is reliable in gauging inflationary trends. Margins can swing sharply from month to month.

Goods prices fell 0.1% in November.

Energy costs fell 0.6% while wholesale food prices rose 0.3%.
