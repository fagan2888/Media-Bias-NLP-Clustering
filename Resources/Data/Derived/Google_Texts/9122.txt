INDIAN TRAIL, N.C. — A woman who called Blue Cross Blue Shield North Carolina said she was on hold for more than seven hours.

WBTV reported that Stephanie Nelson has the hold music from the phone call stuck in her head after the unpleasant experience.

“I have a tendency to wake up with a song in my head in the middle of the night, so this one’s probably going to traumatize me for a while,” Nelson said, according to WBTV.

Nelson said she recently tried contacting Blue Cross Blue Shield to talk to a representative after having problems with the health insurance company.

She said she has gone back-and-forth with the company since November and was told her 2016 policy was confirmed in December. Now, she claims no one can find any record of it.

The company has apologized and blamed the problem on changing Affordable Care Act deadlines and a new customer service system, according to WBTV.
