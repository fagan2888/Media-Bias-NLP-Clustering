Waggoner, who established the estate in 1923.\n\nThe estate includes the 510,000-acre ranch spread over six north Texas counties, with two main compounds, hundreds of homes, about 20 cowboy camps, hundreds of quarter horses, thousands of heads of cattle, 1,200 oil wells and 30,000 acres of cultivated land, according to Dallas-based broker Bernie Uechtritz, who is handling the sale along with broker Sam Middleton of Lubbock.\n\nHeirs and stakeholders currently occupy two of the three principle houses, and much of the estate has not yet been explored for oil and other mineral reserves.\n\nUechtritz says the estate falls within a \u201csuper asset class,\u201d akin to selling the \u201cStatue of Liberty\u201d of cowboy culture. The Waggoner Ranch is the largest contiguous ranch in the United States. Waggoner\u2019s father, Dan, started ranching in 1849, and the Waggoner name was prominent in the development of Hereford cattle and pedigree American quarter horses.\n\n\u201cWhat really sets it apart is that all this land has been kept together under one fence by one family for nearly 100 years, and its history in the settling of the West,\u201d said court-appointed receiver Mike Baskerville.\n\nWaggoner built the Arlington Downs racetrack that operated in Arlington during the 1930s. His granddaughter Electra Waggoner Biggs was a noted sculptress after whom Buick named a luxury car and Lockheed named a plane.\n\nIn 1991, she filed a lawsuit seeking the liquidation of the family estate, spurring a 12-year family feud. Waggoner Biggs died in 2001. When a judge ruled in favor of liquidation in 2003, a primary stakeholder, A.B. \u201cBucky\u201d Wharton III, appealed.\n\nThe family agreed to list the estate after the court said it was considering ordering an auction of the assets, Baskerville said.\n\nLocal residents have been worried that oil wildcatters or foreign investors will divide the land and fire ranch employees \u2014 motivated more by making a profit than by preserving history.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Waggoner ranch, among largest in U.S., put on market for $725 million", "title": "Waggoner ranch, among largest in U.S., put on market for $725 million", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/08/waggoner-ranch-among-largest-in-u-s-put-on-market-for-725-million/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-08T20:46:02+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-08T20:46:02+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9a30\"", "article_summary": "The Waggoner Ranch is the largest contiguous ranch in the United States.\nIn 1991, she filed a lawsuit seeking the liquidation of the family estate, spurring a 12-year family feud.\nHis granddaughter Electra Waggoner Biggs was a noted sculptress after whom Buick named a luxury car and Lockheed named a plane.\nWaggoner\u2019s father, Dan, started ranching in 1849, and the Waggoner name was prominent in the development of Hereford cattle and pedigree American quarter horses.\nThe family agreed to list the estate after the court said it was considering ordering an auction of the assets, Baskerville said."}
