That\u2019s according to a recently completed study looking into the operations of the prison agency.\n\nListen to the story!\n\nCGL\u2014an independent consulting firm\u2014conducted the study, at the request of the state. Brad Sassatelli with CGL says using focus groups, they found two areas of primary concern for correctional staff.\n\n\u201c1) The salary was the number one issue they mentioned, but 2) the lack of number of staff to support them, and the fact there were a large number of TEAs\u2014untrained staff\u2014in the institutions, which raised their concern for their own safety because they had staff working with them who really didn\u2019t know the procedures and how to respond,\u201d he said.\n\nThat\u2019s something Sen. Greg Evers (R-Baker) says he\u2019s aware of as well. He\u2019s the chairman of the Senate Criminal Justice committee, which asked for the findings on the CGL report.\n\n\u201cWell, actually, that I found was the number one issue, when I toured the facilities and I asked, was the number one thing that I need is a person to back me up, to where I feel safe. If I get into a critical situation, that I have someone that can back me up,\u201d said Evers.\n\nAnd, based off informal surveys, Florida Department of Corrections Secretary Julie Jones has made similar remarks\u2014which is reflected in her budget request.\n\n\u201cIn my officer surveys\u2026the officer surveys told me that having someone to back them up, to get the staffing right was more important than a raise,\u201d she said, speaking to reporters, months ago. \u201cThat was very clear.\u201d\n\nAccording to the CGL report, Jones\u2019 agency has an up-to-date hiring process. But, it also states the prison agency still loses around 3,000 officers per year. And, it\u2019s common for the average correctional officer to have less than a year and half of experience.\n\nSassatelli says a large number of new hires have also not yet gone through the required certification training for correctional officers\u2014limiting what they can do.\n\nAnd, he adds staffing levels are becoming a huge problem that are leading to other issues.\n\n\u201cBecause of the staffing levels, there\u2019s a limited number of searches going on. You\u2019re leaving one officer in a housing unit to supervise hundreds of inmates,\u201d Sassatelli said. \u201cBecause of the lack of searches, we saw a significant contraband issue within the facilities.\u201d\n\nContraband can include drugs, weapons, and tobacco products. Prison chief Julie Jones has acknowledged it as a problem. Most announced arrests so far under her tenure as Secretary have been contraband-related.\n\nAnd, the study found the tobacco policy is a contributing factor.\n\n\u201cOne of the issues we heard time and time again in our facility visits was the tobacco policy,\u201d Sassatelli added. \u201cThey have a bifurcated tobacco policy, which is unusual. You don\u2019t find that in facilities across the country. Staff are allowed to bring in tobacco. Inmates are not, and this has created a major issue for the Department of Corrections.\u201d\n\nSo, the CGL report recommends either getting rid of the policy altogether or allowing everyone\u2014correctional staff and inmates alike\u2014to have tobacco products.\n\nOther suggestions include making a clearer use of force policy as well as upgrading cameras, metal detectors, and transport vehicles. Sassatelli says roof repairs\u2014included in Jones\u2019 budget\u2014is also a problem.\n\n\u201cAlthough a great amount of work had been done in the past year, there\u2019s a significant amount of work that needs to be done,\u201d he stated. \u201cWe saw roofs that were patched and then repatched and then repatched a third time. One facility had 22 roofs that were in need of repair. We saw perimeter fences that were deteriorating and rusting and perimeter detection systems\u2014systems that are designed to give you some kind of notification if someone is trying to escape\u2014that were failing. One facility\u2014a medical unit\u2014had a roof repaired, and then found out the water damage was so severe that it had mold and they could not occupy that medical unit.\u201d\n\nJones says she\u2019s already looking into the report\u2019s recommendations as well as doing some work of her own. She\u2019s currently working with the Association of State Correctional Auditors, or ASCA\u2014which has conducted audits for the agency in the past.\n\n\u201cAnd, I\u2019m bringing ASCA back in to do a deep dive and do an extensive staffing evaluation based off their recommendation,\u201d said Jones.\n\nThat \"deep dive\" started Tuesday.\n\nFor more news updates, follow Sascha Cordner on Twitter: @SaschaCordner.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "The Florida Department of Corrections continues to undergo staffing troubles, roofs need repairs, and salary parity is still a main concern among", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://health.wusf.usf.edu/post/report-understaffing-contraband-problems-among-areas-florida-prisons-still-need-work", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/shared/npr/styles/medium/nprshared/201601/462835884.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The Florida Department of Corrections continues to undergo staffing troubles, roofs need repairs, and salary parity is still a main concern among", "title": "Report: Understaffing, Contraband Problems Among Areas Florida Prisons Still Need Work"}, "story_id": 462835434, "twitter": {"site": "@HealthNewsFL", "card": "summary", "creator": "@HealthNewsFL"}, "author": "Sascha Cordner", "org_id": 390, "dc": {"title": "Report: Understaffing, Contraband Problems Among Areas Florida Prisons Still Need Work"}, "nid": 13245, "datePublished": "2016-01-13", "keywords": "prison, Florida prison, Florida Department of Corrections", "wordCount": 977, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "\u201cOne of the issues we heard time and time again in our facility visits was the tobacco policy,\u201d Sassatelli added.\nBrad Sassatelli with CGL says using focus groups, they found two areas of primary concern for correctional staff.\nAnd, it\u2019s common for the average correctional officer to have less than a year and half of experience.\nAnd, the study found the tobacco policy is a contributing factor.\n\u201cThey have a bifurcated tobacco policy, which is unusual."}
