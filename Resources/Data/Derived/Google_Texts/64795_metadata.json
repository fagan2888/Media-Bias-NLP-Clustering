Since then, millions of models of the much-copied invention have been sold worldwide.\n\nThe design was created by British inventor Edward Craven-Walker, who was inspired by an odd-looking, liquid-filled egg timer he saw in a pub in southwest Britain.\n\nThe former World War II pilot then spent years transforming the concept into a home lighting accessory, having recognized the potential for such an invention during anything-goes \u201860s Britain.\n\n\u201cEverything was getting a little bit psychedelic,\u201d said Christine Baehr, the second of Craven-Walker\u2019s four wives. \u201cThere was Carnaby Street and the Beatles and things launching into space, and he thought it was quite funky and might be something to launch into.\u201d\n\nBritain\u2019s \u201cLove Generation\u201d saw an affinity between the fluorescent lava flow\u2019s unpredictable nature and the easy-going, drug-induced spirit of the decade.\n\nCraven-Walker\u2019s first model, the Astro Lamp, also reflected the technological innovation and imagination of the time, shaped like a sci-fi rocket. Soon, other models, such as the Astro Mini and the Astro Nordic, emerged from Craven-Walker\u2019s Crestworth company, building on his original concept.\n\nMs. Baehr recalls a memorable moment when they were told that Beatles drummer Ringo Starr had bought one of their lamps.\n\n\u201cThat was a great, \u2018Ah, we\u2019ve made it\u2019 moment,\u201d she said.\n\nDespite the decline of British manufacturing, with numerous well-known brands dying or moving to countries with cheaper labor costs, lava-lamp-making company Mathmos has remained at its factory in southwest Britain still employing Craven-Walker\u2019s tried-and-tested formula.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s really special to manufacture something that\u2019s been invented and made in Britain, in Britain for 50 years,\u201d said Cressida Granger, who became involved with Crestworth in 1989, renamed it Mathmos in 1992 and gained sole ownership in 1999.\n\nU.S. rights to manufacture the lamps are held by Haggerty Enterprises Inc. of Elk Grove Village, Ill.\n\nMs. Granger went on to enjoy a second wave of success for Craven-Walker\u2019s invention during the 1990s, as a new generation of consumers, obsessed with retro British trends, lit their rooms with \u201860s lava lamp designs.\n\nCraven-Walker, whose other enthusiasms included nudism, died in 2000.\n\nLava lamps are based on two liquids of slightly different density that will not mix. The heavier liquid sinks to the bottom, but when heated by the lamp light, its density decreases and it floats to the top.\n\nHis invention has had roles in music videos and on television, having originally appeared in popular British television shows during the 1960s such as \u201cThe Prisoner\u201d and \u201cDoctor Who.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s the motion within the lamp,\u201d said Anthony Voz, a collector of Mathmos products. \u201cThe way that it flows, how it\u2019s anti-repetitive, how it\u2019s a mixture of light and chaos blending together. It kind of pulls people in, and before you know it, you\u2019ve spent 15 minutes looking at it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Call them relics of the 1960s or hippy home accessories, lava lamps have been casting their dim but groovy light on interiors for a half-century, having hit British shelves 50 years ago on Tuesday.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Call them relics of the 1960s or hippy home accessories, lava lamps have been casting their dim but groovy light on interiors for a half-century, having hit British shelves 50 years ago on Tuesday.", "title": "Lava lamps: 50 years old and still groovy", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/sep/2/lava-lamps-50-years-old-and-still-groovy/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/09/02/britain-lava-lamps_lea.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/09/02/britain-lava-lamps_lea.jpg", "description": "Call them relics of the 1960s or hippy home accessories, lava lamps have been casting their dim but groovy light on interiors for a half-century, having hit British shelves 50 years ago on Tuesday.", "card": "summary", "title": "Lava lamps: 50 years old and still groovy"}, "Author": "James Brooks", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Edward Craven Walker, Christine Baehr"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fceb39\"", "article_summary": "Lava lamps are based on two liquids of slightly different density that will not mix.\nLONDON (AP) \u2014 Call them relics of the 1960s or hippy home accessories, lava lamps have been casting their dim but groovy light on interiors for a half-century, having hit British shelves 50 years ago on Tuesday.\nA British company began marketing their original creation as an \u201cexotic conversation piece\u201d in 1963.\nThe heavier liquid sinks to the bottom, but when heated by the lamp light, its density decreases and it floats to the top.\nMs. Baehr recalls a memorable moment when they were told that Beatles drummer Ringo Starr had bought one of their lamps."}
