Described by Russian officials as the most powerful tank in the world, it is the first overhaul of Russian tank design since the 1960s, and integrates multiple new technologies that arguably make it a match for any other tank currently in service.\n\nRelated: Putin and Kim Jong-un\u2019s \u2018Special Friendship\u2019 on the Rocks\n\nThe turret of the weapon, where a gunner historically sat somewhat exposed to direct fire, is controlled remotely by a crewmember inside a protected pod in the front of the vehicle. The 32 rounds it carries for the smoothbore main gun are loaded automatically by a robotic system, while advanced armor technologies protect the crew.\n\nSome defense experts have suggested that the T-14 represents one of last manned tank designs, with the future belonging to remote-controlled or robotic weapons systems. Its Armata platform will also be the basis for a number of other new Russian combat vehicles expected to be officially unveiled on Saturday.\n\nThe word \u201cofficially\u201d is used here advisedly. The T-14 has not been developed in absolute secrecy, and people who pay attention to things like this, such as Jane\u2019s Defense Weekly, have a pretty good sense of what the T-14 will be able to do.\n\nThat hasn\u2019t stopped Russia\u2019s state-friendly media from treating the unveiling of the T-14 as something akin to the birth of a new British royal.\n\nRelated: Did Putin Snag U.S. Uranium and Sell It to Iran?\n\nWithout any obvious sense of irony, the Kremlin-run Sputnik News has been breathlessly reporting \u201csightings\u201d of the new tank in Moscow. On Wednesday, it posted a link to a YouTube video showing the tank moving through the streets as rehearsals for the Victory Day parade were conducted.\n\nThe Russian government has set a target of 2,300 T-14s in service by 2020, but given the state of the Russian economy, which is likely in recession, it\u2019s not clear how possible that is -- recently as last year, the Kremlin was publicly complaining about the cost of the new system. More telling, the likelihood of waves of T-14 being deployed on Russia\u2019s borders appears low.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Described by Russian officials as the most powerful tank in the world, the T-14 is the first complete overhaul of Russian tank design since the 1960s, and integrates multiple new technologies that arguably make it a match for any other tank currently in service.", "title": "Putin\u2019s Got a Cool New Tank: How Many Can He Afford?", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/05/07/Putin-s-Got-Cool-New-Tank-How-Many-Can-He-Afford", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/T-14.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/05/07/Putin-s-Got-Cool-New-Tank-How-Many-Can-He-Afford", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/T-14.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@rrgarver"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Described by Russian officials as the most powerful tank in the world, the T-14 is the first complete overhaul of Russian tank design since the 1960s, and integrates multiple new technologies that arguably make it a match for any other tank currently in service.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The new tank, the T-14, or Armata Main Battle Tank, is indeed an impressive piece of weaponry.\nDescribed by Russian officials as the most powerful tank in the world, it is the first overhaul of Russian tank design since the 1960s, and integrates multiple new technologies that arguably make it a match for any other tank currently in service.\nWithout any obvious sense of irony, the Kremlin-run Sputnik News has been breathlessly reporting \u201csightings\u201d of the new tank in Moscow.\nSome defense experts have suggested that the T-14 represents one of last manned tank designs, with the future belonging to remote-controlled or robotic weapons systems.\nOn Wednesday, it posted a link to a YouTube video showing the tank moving through the streets as rehearsals for the Victory Day parade were conducted."}
