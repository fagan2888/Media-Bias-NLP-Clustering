DES MOINES, Iowa — A Des Moines airport worker found a torn apart ATM on the grounds Wednesday.

Police now say it is the machine that was stolen from Veterans Memorial in September.

That’s when the suspect was caught on security video breaking into the building. The video showed him pulling the ATM off the wall and pushing it down stairs and into another glass door — breaking it.

The suspect had a truck capable of lifting heavy machinery and took off with the ATM.

Though the machine has been found, police say the suspect remains on the loose.
