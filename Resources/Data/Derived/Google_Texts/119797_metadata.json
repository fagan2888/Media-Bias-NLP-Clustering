Candidates and their supporters start lobbing accusations of \u201cRINO\u201d and try to score cheap political points on a regular basis. It can get pretty tiresome when the insults are just insults, but some of the criticisms are valid. Mitt Romney was rightly blasted in 2012 for passing Romneycare, while Rick Perry took heat for the HPV vaccine mandate. Newt Gingrich was smacked upside the head for being a consultant for Freddie Mac and supporting the individual mandate. Rick Santorum and Mike Huckabee have been hit pretty hard for being too socially conservative and Jon Huntsman was called too moderate. It\u2019s the nature of politics to go after candidates and it certainly hasn\u2019t stopped in this election cycle.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with this because candidates should be held accountable for holding positions which aren\u2019t necessarily \u201cconservative.\u201d Carly Fiorina is getting heat for promoting an individual mandate while on CNN in 2013.\n\n\u201cI actually do agree with those two provisions. And I think Obamacare remains an abomination, and let me tell you why. First of all, I think no one should be denied health care because of pre-existing conditions. And I think there are many more efficient ways we could have dealt with this other than Obamacare.\u201d\n\nShe has every right to be criticized for it, as does the Heritage Foundation for putting it in a 1989 book. There really shouldn\u2019t be a governmental mandate for anything, even if it\u2019s for something most conservatives would support (i.e. the Kennesaw and Nelson, Georgia gun ownership mandates). Those who espouse freedom and liberty should be in favor of individuals being able to make their own decisions, even if it\u2019s wrong. Fiorina also deserves criticism for her promises to grow the military and speaking nebulously about \u201creforming the Department of Defense\u201d in the second debate. Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz also deserve their share of blame for promoting an expansion of military without subsequent cuts. The U.S. should have a military to protect itself, but when a country is over $18T in debt, the only way to grow the military is to either cut from other places or raise taxes. The latter isn\u2019t something conservatives tend to support, nor should they. The former is something conservatives in government don\u2019t do enough.\n\nThere are plenty of criticisms for Jeb Bush, including his support of \u201cfree\u201d community college and his comments about wanting universities to pay back part of a student loan to people who don\u2019t graduate in four years. He\u2019s still got to answer for his support of Common Core or high standards or whatever he\u2019s calling it. Bush\u2019s comments about the Second Amendment and kinda making it sound like the 10th Amendment trumps it, forced him to \u201cclarify\u201d his position to The Daily Caller. Ben Carson had to do his own clarification on the right to own guns, something he called due to his political inexperience.\u201d But he also suggested an extra tax on luxury items to Forbes.\n\n\u201cAdditionally, I would propose a luxury tax on very expensive items which provides an opportunity for the wealthy to pay down the national debt, since all money collected for luxury items would be directed to that purpose.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not exactly a conservative position to take and it\u2019s important to point these things out. Candidates should also be given the right to change their minds, but there\u2019s nothing wrong with questioning why the position change was made. It\u2019s then up to the candidate to try to convince the electorate about why they switched sides and up to the electorate to decide if the candidate is being honest. John Kasich\u2019s horrendous answer on why he campaigned in Indiana against Medicaid expansion in 2010, then accepted it anyway is a big black mark on his candidacy, as is his support of Common Core. Chris Christie\u2019s undying support of the Patriot Act and NSA spying are also a stain, as is his decision to raise tolls and push tax credits for alternative energy. This is why looking at a candidate\u2019s past positions versus current positions is important. It\u2019s the only way to figure out if they\u2019re telling the truth or just saying what\u2019s popular to be elected.\n\nThe same goes for Donald Trump. There are plenty of reasons why he\u2019s gotten so much criticism from conservative and libertarian outlets like National Review, Hot Air, The Daily Caller, Town Hall, Reason, and The American Spectator (which has also published pro-Trump pieces). This is a candidate who has had multiple positions on issues, including calling single payer health care something which could have worked \u201cin a different age\u201d during the first debate. He also said, \u201cwe\u2019ve got to take care of everybody, not just the people up here,\u201d when discussing health care in Phoenix. Trump isn\u2019t talking free markets here, he\u2019s talking government run health care. He\u2019s discussed raising taxes on hedge fund manager, something which conservatives tend to be against, and doesn\u2019t want to do anything with Social Security except put more money into it. These aren\u2019t conservative positions and, as unpopular as it is, there\u2019s nothing wrong with pointing this out.\n\nIt\u2019s obvious people complain when bad things get said or written about the candidates they like. But vetting is important because it can point out a candidate\u2019s weaknesses or when he or she have truly unconservative principles. There\u2019s a real fine line between liberty and tyranny and whenever candidates get close to that line, it\u2019s imperative to mention why they\u2019re wrong. Not every candidate is perfect and not every one of my own personal position check marks are going to be filled out. But if the Right is going to just blindly embrace candidates, without considering their faults, what\u2019s the point of having an actual debate on the issues?\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "It\u2019s not purity, it\u2019s holding candidates accountable.", "title": "Why vetting matters in political races", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2015/09/26/why-vetting-matters-in-political-races/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@JazzShaw"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-26T21:01:21+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-27T08:09:55+00:00"}, "keywords": "2016 elections, gop. 2016, presidency, vetting,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe22f4\"", "article_summary": "These aren\u2019t conservative positions and, as unpopular as it is, there\u2019s nothing wrong with pointing this out.\nCandidates and their supporters start lobbing accusations of \u201cRINO\u201d and try to score cheap political points on a regular basis.\nBut vetting is important because it can point out a candidate\u2019s weaknesses or when he or she have truly unconservative principles.\nThis is why looking at a candidate\u2019s past positions versus current positions is important.\nWhy vetting matters in political racesposted at 5:01 pm on September 26, 2015 by Taylor MillardThe GOP presidential primary tends to turn into silly season or a full-on WWE Elimination Chamber match pretty quickly."}
