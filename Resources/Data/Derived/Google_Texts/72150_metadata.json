INDIA \u201980 \u201990 \u201900 \u201910 \u201920 \u201930 \u201940 \u201950\n\nThe regulation, which must go through a public comment period before taking effect, will certainly be challenged in the courts and in Congress, but Mr. Obama has past judicial rulings to cite in his defense and enough votes on Capitol Hill that would allow him to veto any opposing legislation and make it stick.\n\nIf the regulation survives the lobbyists and lawyers intact, the battles will move to state capitals as businesses, environmentalists and lawmakers joust in 50 separate arenas over the scope of the resulting rules.\n\nJust as some states balked at devising ways of carrying out Mr. Obama\u2019s health care program, forcing the federal government to step in in many cases, some governors are signaling that they will resist the new restrictions on power plants. Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, a conservative Republican who has been mentioned as a possible presidential candidate in 2016, said he would oppose the rule while finding \u201ccommon-sense solutions\u201d that protect workers and consumers. Indiana gets about 80 percent of its electricity from coal.\n\n\u201cThese proposed regulations will be devastating for Hoosier workers and families,\u201d Mr. Pence said. \u201cThey will cost us in higher electricity rates, in lost jobs, and in lost business growth due to a lack of affordable, reliable electricity. Indiana will oppose these regulations using every means available.\u201d\n\nA number of states are expected to sue the E.P.A. over the rule. Many Republican governors, in particular, are ideologically opposed to the prospect of enacting cap-and-trade programs. And some may follow the path of Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, who in the past has signaled his state\u2019s opposition to E.P.A. pollution regulations by simply refusing to submit compliance plans.\n\nPhoto\n\nThat could set up a standoff in which the E.P.A. would step in and force states to comply with a plan devised by federal rather than state officials.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhite House officials recognized the possible challenges in a state-by-state plan, but said they had little choice given the language of the law on which the regulation is based, and they expressed optimism that industry would want an orderly process. \u201cWhile I am sure that there will be holdouts amongst the states, most utilities will also want to work with their regulators to ensure successful implementation,\u201d said John D. Podesta, Mr. Obama\u2019s counselor.\n\nIn assigning the cuts, E.P.A. officials said, they took into account state economies and current emission levels and what each could practically achieve without causing economic harm. The rule calls on a coal-dependent state like Kentucky to cut its plant emissions rate by 19 percent and one like West Virginia by 21 percent, according to an analysis by the Georgetown University Climate Center.\n\nBy comparison, the plan calls on Washington State, which has just one coal-fired power plant, and relies on hydroelectric power, to cut its emissions rate 84 percent.\n\n\u201cOtherwise, what would have happened to states like West Virginia and Kentucky would be unacceptable, economically,\u201d said Robert Stavins, director of Harvard University\u2019s Environmental Economics Program.\n\nGov. Jay Inslee of Washington, a liberal who, like Mr. Obama, hopes to make climate policy a signature of his tenure, cheered the rule. He said it would \u201cencourage and empower ongoing state and regional climate action, such as our collaborative efforts to grow the Pacific Coast\u2019s clean energy economy.\u201d",
