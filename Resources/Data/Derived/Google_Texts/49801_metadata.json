Although the company said there have been no reports of illnesses in either human or animals, it decided to take this \u201cprecautionary measure\u201d after the Maryland Department of Agriculture discovered Listeria monocytogenes in a 15-ounce bag of Chewy\u2019s Chicken Freeze-Dried Dinner Patties for Dogs.\n\n\u201cStella & Chewy\u2019s (S&C) is announcing a voluntary recall of some of our dog and cat dinners and treats in the U.S. because they have the potential to be contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes,\u201d the company said on its Facebook page. \u201cThe recall was prompted by a positive test result as reported by the Maryland Department of Agriculture.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, around 1,600 people get sick from Listeria each year in the United States. Currently, it is considered the third leading cause of death from food poisoning. Around 90 percent of people who are infected with Listeria each year are pregnant women, infants, people over the age of 65, or people with weakened immune systems. Flu-like symptoms tied to Listeria include high fever, severe headache, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain, and diarrhea.\n\n\u201cThe health and safety of our customers and their pets is always of the utmost importance to us. We are accountable for everything we make and are highly committed to the quality and integrity of our products. We are working collaboratively with the FDA to further investigate and quickly address the situation.\u201d\n\nIf you believe your pet has been exposed to Listeria, Stella & Chewy recommends scheduling an immediate appointment with your veterinarian and contact its service team at info@stellaandchewys.com or 888-477-8977. The company has provided a full list of all recalled products on its website.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "pet, food, recall, stella, chewys, voluntarily, recalls, products, cats, and, dogs, over", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Stella & Chewy's voluntarily recalls products for dogs and cats over possible Listeria contamination.", "title": "What You Should Know About Stella & Chewy's Pet Product Recall", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/pet-food-recall-stella-chewys-voluntarily-recalls-products-cats-and-dogs-over-341326", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured/public/2015/07/06/stella-chewys.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Stella & Chewy's voluntarily recalls products for dogs and cats over possible Listeria contamination.", "title": "What You Should Know About Stella & Chewy's Pet Product Recall", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/pet-food-recall-stella-chewys-voluntarily-recalls-products-cats-and-dogs-over-341326", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured/public/2015/07/06/stella-chewys.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/07/06/stella-chewys.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-07-06T11:22:30-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-06T11:22:29-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Stella & Chewy's voluntarily recalls products for dogs and cats over possible Listeria contamination."}, "article_summary": "Pet food supplier Stella & Chewy\u2019s has issued a voluntary recall that includes products for dogs and cats over a potential Listeria contamination.\n\u201cStella & Chewy\u2019s (S&C) is announcing a voluntary recall of some of our dog and cat dinners and treats in the U.S. because they have the potential to be contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes,\u201d the company said on its Facebook page.\nWe are accountable for everything we make and are highly committed to the quality and integrity of our products.\nThe company has provided a full list of all recalled products on its website.\nFlu-like symptoms tied to Listeria include high fever, severe headache, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain, and diarrhea."}
