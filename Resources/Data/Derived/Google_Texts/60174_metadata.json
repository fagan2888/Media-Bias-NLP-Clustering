This is problematic because union members are not asked for permission before this money is spent, and it is often difficult to ask for a refund,\u201d labor watchdog Center for Union Facts wrote in the wake of the decision.\n\nThe ATU, which represents nearly 200,000 transit workers, spent more than $1.2 million in 2012 and has spent more than $600,000 in the 2014 interims, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. The national union spent more than $2 million on political activities, according to its Labor Department filings\u2014about 10 percent of all money collected from its local members.\n\nThe ATU\u2019s political spending pales in comparison to its parent organization, the AFL-CIO.\n\nThe union has spent big money on elections with almost all of their money benefitting Democrats. It contributed more than $9 million to liberals, including tens of thousands of dollars for President Barack Obama and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, and spent another $8 million on election efforts, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Only 20 groups in America spent more during the 2012 cycle.\n\nAFL-CIO is nearly as active in the 2014 election cycle that will determine the Senate majority. It is among the top 15 biggest spenders this year with more than $6 million going to Democrats.\n\n\u201cRight now, the political playing field looks like a long, steep hill with working families at the bottom and big business and the wealthy at the top,\u201d Hanley said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t level the playing field, corporations and the uber rich will continue to rule America at the expense of everyone else.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Amalgamated Transit Union spends millions every year on politics", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "A union that spent more than $1 million during the 2012 election is calling on Congress to ban big money donations.
