Politics: Fiorina answers question with job offer By Jason Lesley\n\nCoastal Observer Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina didn\u2019t get to be CEO of computer giant Hewlett-Packard without the ability to recognize potential in people. When Waccamaw High graduate Bobby Walters, 18, asked her how she planned to motivate young people to get involved in politics during a campaign stop in Litchfield this week, Fiorina acted on instinct. \u201cMaybe you\u2019ll help me?\u201d she told Walters in front of a full house at the Tara Theater at Litchfield Beach and Golf Resort. After her 60-minute address, Fiorina offered Walters a job as an intern working at her South Carolina campaign\u2019s headquarters in Columbia. Walters, a freshman at the University of South Carolina, said he\u2019s thinking about taking the part-time internship and promised to let Fiorina\u2019s campaign staff know in a week or so. \u201cI didn\u2019t really know that much about her,\u201d Walters said, \u201cbut I was very impressed. She was saying some things that made a lot of sense.\u201d He said being on a presidential campaign staff would be \u201cgood for the resume, especially if she gets somewhere in the election.\u201d Fiorina told her audience Monday that she began thinking about running for president after hearing a young man say Americans don\u2019t consider this a nation of limitless possibilities any more. \u201cWe are,\u201d she said. \u201cWe always have been, and if we lose that sense of limitless possibilities, we lose the core of who we are.\u201d Fiorina said her personal story, going from a secretary in a real estate office to the CEO of Hewlett-Packard, is only possible in America. Her husband, she said, started as a tow truck driver and become an executive at AT&T. \u201cHere you have the right to seize your possibilities and pursue your own path,\u201d she said. \u201cThose possibilities are being crushed by a government that has become so big, so powerful, so costly, so complicated, so inept and so corrupt.\u201d Fiorina said she agreed with a poll that concluded 75 percent of Americans think the federal government is corrupt. \u201cThe more big and powerful the government gets, who is favored?\u201d she asked. \u201cThe big, the powerful, the wealthy, the well-connected.\u201d She said the country is run by a professional political class, both Democrats and Republicans, that thinks more about power, position and privilege \u2014 and re-election \u2014 than about getting things done. \u201cOver time,\u201d Fiorina said, \u201cpeople become managers and accept the system. They don\u2019t challenge the system. They don\u2019t push against the status quo and as they accept the system, they become over time a part of the system. Leaders challenge the system. They don\u2019t accept it just because it\u2019s been broken for a long time. Leaders know their highest calling is to challenge the status quo.\u201d Fiorina laid out her blueprint to do just that. She said she would simplify the tax code, reducing it from 73,000 pages to three. The Internal Revenue Service, she said, has more personnel than the FBI and CIA combined. She called for \u201czero-based budgeting\u201d of the federal government. Fiorina called the Affordable Care Act an 80,000-page \u201cmonstrosity\u201d that has led to crony capitalism in the health care system and should be repealed. She said she would return education to the states. Fiorina pledged to secure the U.S. border with Mexico and to develop a cooperative effort between the tech sector and the government to thwart terrorism. \u201cIt is delusional and dangerous,\u201d she said, \u201cfor Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama to be talking about gun control and climate change when terrorists are murdering people in San Bernardino and Paris.\u201d Tim Tilley, owner of the Georgetown company EnviroSep, said he was impressed with Fiorina. \u201cI think she\u2019s incredible \u2014 extremely polished,\u201d he said after her speech. Tilley said it\u2019s too early in the campaign to tell who\u2019s going to emerge and if Fiorina has a chance. \u201cIt will be interesting to see what happens with [Donald] Trump after Christmas.\u201d Judy Clarke, president of the Georgetown County Republican Women\u2019s Federation, said Fiorina made a strong case for her candidacy. \u201cI thought she was excellent,\u201d Clarke said, \u201cvery, very strong.\u201d [E-Mail Article To a Friend]", "article_metadata": {}, "article_summary": "After her 60-minute address, Fiorina offered Walters a job as an intern working at her South Carolina campaign\u2019s headquarters in Columbia.\n\u201cMaybe you\u2019ll help me?\u201d she told Walters in front of a full house at the Tara Theater at Litchfield Beach and Golf Resort.\nTilley said it\u2019s too early in the campaign to tell who\u2019s going to emerge and if Fiorina has a chance.\nLeaders know their highest calling is to challenge the status quo.\u201d Fiorina laid out her blueprint to do just that.\nTHIS WEEK\u2019S TOP STORIESBobby Walters, a freshman at the University of South Carolina, asks how the the candidate plans to motivate young people."}
