But how much should you spend on each piece?\n\nIs a cheap and cheerful T-shirt costing a few pounds really a bargain? Are designer jeans on sale for \u00a3400 any better than High Street denims?\n\nWe asked fashion experts to lift the lid on when to save and when to spend . . .\n\nSPLURGE: COAT, \u00a3300\n\nFashion experts agree it\u2019s worth splurging on a classic style or lightweight trench that won\u2019t date.\n\n\u2018A coat that costs around \u00a3300, such as Jaeger\u2019s double-breasted trench coat (\u00a3299), is guaranteed to be made from robust fabric,\u2019 says personal stylist Alicia Kite of Alicia Kay Style.\n\nTo check the quality, grab a handful of the coat\u2019s fabric and squeeze it hard for 20 seconds. If it looks like a crumpled paper bag when you let it go, this is how it\u2019s likely to look after a long journey.\n\n'Jaeger\u2019s double-breasted trench coat (\u00a3299), is guaranteed to be made from robust fabric,\u2019 says personal stylist Alicia Kite\n\nChoose a neutral colour that flatters your skin tone. \u2018Classic beige is a safe bet,\u2019 says Alicia. \u2018But there are many shades, from near white to toffee, which may be more flattering.\n\n\u2018Whatever your shape, the coat should be tailored.\u2019\n\nUse a wooden coat hanger with wide-shaped shoulders. The natural wooden broad jacket hanger (\u00a32.71, thehangerstore.co.uk) is perfect. When you put it in the wardrobe, do up the buttons and check the collar and lapels are sitting flat.\n\nSCRIMP: SHIRT, \u00a320\n\n\u2018A white shirt only looks really good when it\u2019s pristine,\u2019 says fashion stylist and TV presenter Grace Woodward.\n\n\u2018No matter how carefully you wash them, white shirts \u2014 even the most expensive ones \u2014 will start to grey and discolour under the arms fairly quickly, so it\u2019s not worth spending a fortune.\u2019\n\nA mid-quality, tailored shirt from a reliable High Street brand such as M&S or Next can look smart.\n\n\u2018A white shirt only looks really good when it\u2019s pristine,\u2019 says fashion stylist and TV presenter Grace Woodward\n\nThe M&S no peep easy-to-iron Dobby shirt (\u00a318) or Next\u2019s long- sleeve white stretch shirt (\u00a320) are good options.\n\nAnd the fit is all-important if you want it to look as if you\u2019ve spent more than you have,\u2019 says Alicia Kite.\n\n\u2018Women with a large bust look best in a plain tailored shirt. Smaller-busted women suit shirts with detail on the bust, such as pockets, pintucks or embroidery.\n\n\u2018Only wash it with other whites, and iron it with starch as soon as it has dried. Use a plastic hanger and make sure the top button is fastened when you put it in the wardrobe.\u2019\n\nSCRIMP: HEELS, \u00a330\n\n\u2018Think about how often you are going to wear the pair of heels you\u2019re buying before you spend,\u2019 says fashion stylist and businesswear designer Kay Davidson.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s worth investing a bit of money in a good-quality classic court shoe for everyday workwear. The nude Sybila court shoes (\u00a3170) from one of the Duchess of Cambridge\u2019s favourite brands LK Bennett go with everything and will make your legs look longer.\n\nNext\u2019s colour-block double-strap sandals (\u00a328) are affordable but look frivolous too\n\n\u2018But if you need a pair of strappy heels for a special occasion, the cheaper High Street names are perfect. Brands such as New Look, Next and Primark produce fashion heels at budget prices.\n\n\u2018You can afford something that looks frivolous, such as New Look\u2019s orange snakeskin multi-strap shoes (\u00a329.99) or Next\u2019s colour-block double-strap sandals (\u00a328).\n\nSPLURGE: DRESS, \u00a380\n\n\u2018The wrap dress is a classic style and variations of it can look good on almost every figure, but don\u2019t buy cheap,\u2019 says Kay Davidson. \u2018Most are made from a stretchy jersey fabric. Unfortunately, thin, cheap jersey can be unforgiving, revealing lumps and bumps.\n\nA front-tying bow defines the opulent floral print dress by Alice Temperley (\u00a3130, John Lewis)\n\n\u2018Heavyweight fabric and patterns disguise any flaws.\u2019\n\nBoden\u2019s summer wrap dress (\u00a379) comes in a thick material, three fittings (petite, regular and long), nine sizes and flattering colours and prints.\n\nA front-tying bow defines the opulent floral print dress by Alice Temperley (\u00a3130, John Lewis).\n\nSCRIMP: PUMPS, \u00a312\n\nThere\u2019s no need to spend a small fortune on ballet pumps, according to Alicia Kite.\n\n\u2018Most of the High Street stores have lovely on-trend colours and styles.\n\nAsos\u2019s silver lily pad ballet flats (\u00a312) are a great accessory for light coloured spring outfits\n\n\u2018Cheap pumps can look expensive if you make sure they fit and treat them well. Keep them clean, polished and stored carefully.\n\n\u2018Asos\u2019s silver lily pad ballet flats (\u00a312) and Dorothy Perkins\u2019 wide-fit print detailed pumps (\u00a328) will accessorise your spring outfits beautifully.\u2019\n\nSCRIMP: CASHMERE, \u00a350\n\nthe experts say there\u2019s no need to spend too much on cashmere.\n\n\u2018A cashmere V-neck sweater from specialists Brora will set you back \u00a3240,\u2019 says Alicia Kite. \u2018But you can buy similar jumpers at Uniqlo and M&S from \u00a350 to \u00a380.\u2019\n\nM&S has a range of cashmere jumpers on offer in different colours and styles, costing between \u00a350 and \u00a380\n\nThe only drawback with cheaper cashmere can be an increased tendency to bobble.\n\nAlicia suggests using a soft shoebrush to lightly brush the jumper every time you put it on.\n\nAnd Julia Dee, founder of clothes storage and care emporium Total Wardrobe Care, says cashmere can be handwashed in cool water with a mild detergent. Store it on a knitwear hanger.\n\nSPLURGE: JEANS, \u00a3100\n\n\u2018if you like to dress up your denim, it\u2019s well worth investing some money in a top quality pair,\u2019 says Alicia Kite.\n\n\u2018Apply the cost per wear sum \u2014 \u00a3100 might sound like a lot but, if you are wearing your jeans several times a week, it\u2019s a sensible investment.\u2019 But fashion stylist Grace Woodward warns against spending much more than \u00a3100.\n\nLevi\u2019s demi curve straight jeans (\u00a390, John Lewis) are great for a pear-shaped figure\n\n\u2018Some high-end brands cost upwards of \u00a3400, but there\u2019s very little difference with a \u00a3100 pair.\u2019\n\nDry-clean the first time they need cleaning to fix the colour. Then, says Grace Woodward, wash them inside out on a cold wash and hang them out to dry.\n\nLevi\u2019s demi curve straight jeans (\u00a390, John Lewis) are great for a pear-shaped figure.\n\nSlim legs will be elongated in Betty Barclay slim-leg five-pocket jeans (\u00a3100, John Lewis).\n\nSPLURGE: T-SHIRT, \u00a325\n\nUnless you\u2019re a whippet-thin teenager, says Alicia Kite, steer clear of super-cheap T-shirts.\n\n\u2018Most of them are thin and don\u2019t have the structure or shape to flatter a more mature figure.\u2019\n\nShe recommends M&S and Uniqlo for good quality T-shirts between \u00a38 and \u00a310. \u2018And Hobbs T-shirts cost \u00a319 to \u00a325, but are the perfect cut for a larger bust. Jigsaw also produce a great range, starting at \u00a325.\u2019", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "news_keywords": "Scrimp,splurge,spring,classics,really,worth,splashing,on", "original-source": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-3046060/Scrimp-splurge-spring-classics-really-worth-splashing-on.html", "doc-class": "Living Document", "twitter": {"description": "Wrap dresses, trench coats, a cashmere jumper and white shirts are all wardrobe staples.
