He is also a former executive director of the Greater Los Angeles chapter of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and is a member of the Project 21 black leadership network.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Citizen and Immigration Service within the Department of Homeland Security, U.S. law defines a refugee as someone \u201clocated outside the United States,\u201d has \u201cspecial humanitarian concern,\u201d \u201cdemonstrates that they were persecuted or fear prosecution\u201d and \u201cis admissible to the United States.\u201d Hicks said people from Latin America may be in dire straits but don\u2019t meet that criteria, and Obama\u2019s efforts to unilaterally change the criteria \u201cturns the whole notion of refugee on its head.\n\n\u201cPrior to Obama, the notion of a refugee was someone who was fleeing war or some similar kind of circumstance in their home countries. No doubt, there are very bad conditions in Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, as it is in Mexico and in much of central and South America,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut as long as I can remember \u2026 those nations were experiencing poverty and violence, but not from wars,\u201d Hicks noted. \u201cThese are endemic to those nations\u2019 cultures. So to claim that this is some new rationale to allow these immigrants to stay in the country based on a refugee status makes no sense because those nations have always had conditions of poverty and gang activity.\u201d\n\nListen to the WND/Radio America interview with Joe Hicks:\n\nIf Obama were to go through with designating millions of illegal immigrants as refugees, they could well be on the path to citizenship. Hicks argued against blanket amnesty for an an entire nation or region of the world.\n\n\u201cThere is no automatic right to come to this country as a refugee. We have to make the determination. The government and the proper authorities have to look at all of these cases and determine if, or if they do not, measure up to prior standards, which have normally been held almost as international standards of what a refugee is,\u201d said Hicks, who argues the flood of young people illegally crossing the border came prepared to appeal for refugee status.\n\n\u201cThese kids coming across the border (are) virtually reading from a script to border agents because they know the proper language to use. \u2018We\u2019re fleeing poverty and violence.\u2019 Those were the two words they would routinely use,\u201d he explained. \u201cThey\u2019ve been put in detention and in some cases resettled all across the country. So it really does make a mockery out of the process.\u201d\n\nHicks also studies the impact that the cheap labor provided by these illegal immigrants will have on the U.S. economy. He said young and low-skilled black workers are already hardest hit in this economy, and Obama\u2019s plan would make things far worse.\n\n\u201cBlack low-skilled workers and black workers in general continue to be affected by the recession. They suffered longer and deeper under this recession. Their unemployment numbers are still above the norm by a fairly disproportionate level,\u201d said Hicks, arguing that illegals already have a leg up on American citizens on the job front.\n\n\u201cThere are parts of this country where you can go into fast-food restaurants where there is a high percentage of Latino illegal labor available. You simply cannot find a black kid working in a fast-food restaurant,\u201d he said. \u201cGo on a construction site in many parts of this country. You can\u2019t find black workers working at those sites because Latino workers have simply depressed the wages.\u201d\n\nHicks said Obama granting refugee status to millions who shouldn\u2019t qualify for it will only lead to more frustration among black workers.\n\n\u201cYes, they will be harmed,\u201d he said. \u201cProject 21\u2019s view is that will not be something that most black workers welcome if five to 15 million new illegal aliens are made legal by the stroke of the pen by this president.\u201d\n\nOnly 31 percent of Americans approve of Obama\u2019s handling of the immigration issue. Some think he\u2019s going much too far while others are frustrated he\u2019s not moving faster or being aggressive enough. The number is not likely to get any better as Obama delays his executive action.\n\nBut Hicks said the president\u2019s lack of action should not be interpreted as Obama being rudderless on the issue.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s confused,\u201d he said. \u201cI think he knows exactly what he\u2019s trying to do, and he\u2019s doing it for political reasoning. I think a lot of Americans will be outraged that he didn\u2019t simply bring his argument before the people, in this case before Congress, and make his best case to try to get Congress to act. Presidents are not like a child. You don\u2019t always get everything you want.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "President Obama plans to legalize millions of illegal immigrants by granting refugee status to people coming to the U.S. unlawfully from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador even though they shouldn\u2019t qualify, according to a prominent black conservative, who warns that the president\u2019s strategy will have a devastating impact on workers in the black community. \u201cIt\u2019s [\u2026]", "title": "Expert: Obama plans to devastate black workers", "url": "http://www.wnd.com/2014/09/expert-obama-plans-to-devastate-black-workers/", "image": "http://www.wnd.com/files/2014/09/black_worker.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 152299868169938}, "google-site-verification": "5iw1bKISvQcI1qRwIskRfer6GKV4jUf6LImfS9bhaeI", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf937\"", "article_summary": "\u201cBlack low-skilled workers and black workers in general continue to be affected by the recession.\nYou can\u2019t find black workers working at those sites because Latino workers have simply depressed the wages.\u201dHicks said Obama granting refugee status to millions who shouldn\u2019t qualify for it will only lead to more frustration among black workers.\nHe said young and low-skilled black workers are already hardest hit in this economy, and Obama\u2019s plan would make things far worse.\nSome think he\u2019s going much too far while others are frustrated he\u2019s not moving faster or being aggressive enough.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s confused,\u201d he said."}
