Those factors include low income, social isolation, disadvantaged neighborhoods and limited health literacy. The report is the second of five commissioned for the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nFederal officials have announced the plan to move Medicare from a system in which doctors and hospitals are paid based on the volume of services they provide. The goal is a value-based payment system to encourage a better quality of care, better health outcomes and control costs.\n\nUse Our Content This KHN story can be republished for free ( details ).\n\nSome research has found that hospitals serving disadvantaged patients may be more likely to receive poor quality ratings and receive financial penalties, the report said. Yet, an analysis of actual penalties under one of the new quality efforts to reduce the number of Medicare beneficiaries who are readmitted to a hospital within 30 days reported that so-called \u201csafety-net\u201d hospitals drew only slightly higher penalties than non-safety net hospitals, according to the National Academies panel.\n\n\u201cThe drivers of these disparities in both health care quality and health outcomes are poorly understood and differences in interpretation have led to divergent concerns about the potential effect of (value-based payment) on health equity,\u201d the report said.\n\nThe National Academies panel said some common themes emerged from its review of 60 case studies and peer-reviewed research. One was what can be accomplished when doctors and hospitals partner with social service agencies, public health agencies, community organizations and the community itself, the panel said.\n\nA health system in that context may prepare a comprehensive needs assessment, according to the report, but its vision will be different if the assessment is grounded by a commitment to health equity and includes social needs as well as clinical needs.\n\n\u201cThis report does show that socially at-risk populations do not need to experience low-quality care and bad health outcomes,\u201d the report said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new study from the National Academies of Sciences seeks best practices for health providers whose patients are disproportionately disadvantaged.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "Kaiser Health News", "description": "A new study from the National Academies of Sciences seeks best practices for health providers whose patients are disproportionately disadvantaged.", "title": "Study: More Collaboration Aids Health Care For At-Risk Populations", "url": "http://khn.org/news/study-more-collaboration-aids-health-care-for-at-risk-populations/", "image": {"width": 570, "identifier": "https://kaiserhealthnews.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/female-doctor-770.jpg", "height": 380}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://kaiserhealthnews.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/female-doctor-770.jpg?w=640"}, "site": "@khnews", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@khnews"}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "application-name": "Kaiser Health News", "google-site-verification": "El-hccfbhMd9lv-h8wAfp8Qu5KhqI8hjJMi1-CefIoQ", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WordPresscom", "published_time": "2016-04-07T15:00:38+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-08T12:44:04+00:00"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://khn.org/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThis report does show that socially at-risk populations do not need to experience low-quality care and bad health outcomes,\u201d the report said.\nThe goal is a value-based payment system to encourage a better quality of care, better health outcomes and control costs.\n\u201cThe drivers of these disparities in both health care quality and health outcomes are poorly understood and differences in interpretation have led to divergent concerns about the potential effect of (value-based payment) on health equity,\u201d the report said.\nThe report is the second of five commissioned for the Department of Health and Human Services.\nThose factors include low income, social isolation, disadvantaged neighborhoods and limited health literacy."}
