In the past year he starred on Eva Longoria\u2019s short-lived dating television show \u201cReady for Love,\u201d wrote an advice book, \u201cGet the Guy,\u201d that spent a week on the New York Times Bestseller List, and now appears as a regular guest on the \u201cToday Show\u201d for his own spot, called \u201cThe Other View.\u201d\n\nI wanted to know what life was like for a life coach. What does he think about when he\u2019s not onstage? Why is helping other people his core preoccupation? Over a nearly three-hour lunch, Matthew and I talked about his daily life, the value of loneliness, his thoughts on \u201cThe Secret,\u201d and why some people are just so damn stupid.\n\nBelow are excerpts from that conversation.\n\nThe demand in our culture for life coaches, relationship gurus and matchmakers is so high that I can\u2019t help wonder whether the industry inspired our feelings of deficiency in order to fill it, or whether it\u2019s a result of something less calculated, like over-permissive parenting.\n\nPeople aren\u2019t ashamed to ask for help the way they once were. Life coaching, matchmaking, online dating, these aren\u2019t weird or ugly words anymore and that, I think, goes hand-in-hand with the kind of quick-fix culture that we have, which is: You got a problem? We\u2019ll fix it in a day. You want to be rich? We\u2019ll do that in a month. You want a great body? Give me seven days and I\u2019ll give you six-pack abs. We live in a culture populated by experts, leaders and gurus who claim to know the quickest route to getting you very compelling things. A lot of those people talk complete and utter BS. To a large extent, I\u2019m not a fan of those things. I am in it, but I see myself as an outsider, strangely. I don\u2019t associate with it.\n\nFor instance\u2026?\n\nThe whole \u201cSecret\u201d sensation really rubbed me the wrong way; I just don\u2019t believe in it. The grain of truth is that what you focus on you\u2019ll get more of, and that\u2019s got to do with the reticular activating system in your brain, not \u201cThe Secret.\u201d Let\u2019s say tomorrow you decide that you quite fancy buying a red car. Your research mission for the next month will be finding a good red car. Most likely you\u2019ll see red cars everywhere. That\u2019s not because the universe is bringing red cars into your existence. They were always there. You\u2019re just more conscious of them. The people who buy into it are buying into the positive reinforcement. I drove here and got all green lights because I focused on green lights, or, I was parking and I focused on the space that I wanted and it was there! What are you talking about? That doesn\u2019t tell me anything. That tells me you found an available parking space.\n\nYour brain is not sending out waves to the universe that are bringing you green lights and parking spaces. They\u2019ve turned wishing for things into a science and I think, how have you done this? This isn\u2019t science. When did you decide that this was science? I think it\u2019s damaging for people. I really believe it\u2019s damaging because everything that\u2019s come to me in my life has come because I worked fucking hard and tirelessly and I lost sleep and I lost out on girlfriends and I missed a big chunk of my twenties where I should have been being twenty-two and I wasn\u2019t, I was being forty-five, and I sacrificed a lot. It did not just come to me. Not to mention, most of those people never achieved what they\u2019re asking their clients to achieve.\n\nThe other danger is that the success of their brand is predicated on keeping the consumer helpless. By claiming to have the answers, they encourage a cycle of dependence from their supporters.\n\nYou know, it\u2019s not good for my career to talk negatively of \u201cThe Secret.\u201d There are plenty of powerful people close to it who could offer me a lot of opportunities, not to mention an enormous amount of people who do buy into it and will feel at odds with me philosophically because I don\u2019t, so it\u2019s not a popular thing to say, it\u2019s not a good financial move to say it, but I can\u2019t lie. I have strong views, and I can\u2019t imagine not ever being honest about those views. One of the people I most admired was Christopher Hitchens. He was extremely polarizing but extremely honest, to a fault sometimes, but I respected him for that, and I loved his debating style. I loved the way he came across in the media because he didn\u2019t fear anyone in that way and I intend to live out my time in the media, for as long as it lasts, in the same way.\n\nIt\u2019s curious that you admired someone who didn\u2019t care whether everyone, or anyone, loved what he had to say.\n\nWe just released a trailer for our new book on YouTube. In it, kids act like adults talking about their relationship problems, and we got so much positive feedback\u2013but there was another group of people who, from our point of view, completely missed the point.\n\nWhat was the point?\n\nA lot of comments were like, \u201cKids are growing up too fast. They shouldn\u2019t be talking about things like this.\u201d To which we said, it wasn\u2019t made for kids; it was a satire. We thought it\u2019d be funny to have kids saying adult things. When was the last time you watched a horror film and said, it\u2019s disgraceful they put a kid in that horror film, how dare they have a kid who\u2019s a demon? People don\u2019t do that, but they saw our trailer\u2014where a kid says, \u201cSometimes I think it\u2019d be easier if we were all lesbians\u201d\u2014and the 10% of crazies on YouTube said, \u201cHow dare you teach people about lesbians at that age!\u201d And you just go, you are mental, you just are totally mental. And then there were other people who said, \u201cThis is so fake,\u201d and I thought to myself, you are too stupid to live. You shouldn\u2019t be allowed to function in normal society because that is the most stupid thing anyone has ever said.\n\nEven when you have majority appeal, you can\u2019t always appeal to the majority.\n\nI had a terrible moment in a seminar on public speaking, and by the way, for me, what I perceive myself as doing is strategy. You want to look more attractive to the opposite sex? There is a strategy for that. You want to be a better public speaker? There\u2019s a strategy for that. It\u2019s not self-help; it\u2019s not spiritual enlightenment. There are ways to be a better public speaker and I know those ways because I\u2019ve done it myself. Of the many things I am not good at, one thing I am good at is public speaking, so I can teach people that. I got up and gave this seminar and I was swearing in the first five minutes and there was a group of religious women in the fourth row back and one of them shouted at me five minutes in and said, \u201cExcuse me can you please stop swearing?\u201d My immediate response was, You\u2019re in my event! You don\u2019t show up to a comedian\u2019s event and like, tell them what routine to do!\n\nUh yeah, you do. They\u2019re called hecklers and they\u2019re assholes.\n\nWell, yeah, it\u2019s true. But you know it made me angry, and I did something that wasn\u2019t very tactful and I\u2014I didn\u2019t even address this person\u2014I just said, I want everyone to pull out your notebooks and I want you to write this down: \u201cMatt Hussey doesn\u2019t give a fuck.\u201d Now suddenly a guy in that row wants to be a hero and says, \u201cI don\u2019t appreciate you saying that,\u201d and I said, \u201cListen. You\u2019re at my event. I haven\u2019t insulted you or the person you\u2019re with, but the truth is I don\u2019t give a fuck because I\u2019m not here to please you. If you want to leave and get your money back on the way out, you are more than welcome to; there will be someone waiting with cash at the door to give you your money back. I will owe you nothing, but please don\u2019t ruin my event, and with that the whole fourth row got up and walked out, and this was an event on public speaking!!!", "article_metadata": {"description": "Life coach Matthew Hussey on the advice he'd never give, and why he wants to be like Christopher Hitchens", "title": "The life coach who loves Christopher Hitchens and hates \u201cThe Secret\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Life coach Matthew Hussey on the advice he'd never give, and why he wants to be like Christopher Hitchens", "title": "The life coach who loves Christopher Hitchens and hates \u201cThe Secret\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/09/22/the_life_coach_who_loves_christopher_hitchens_and_hates_the_secret/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/09/matthey_hussey.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Life coach Matthew Hussey on the advice he'd never give, and why he wants to be like Christopher Hitchens", "title": "The life coach who loves Christopher Hitchens and hates \u201cThe Secret\u201d", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/09/matthey_hussey.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Amanda Stern", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Books, Christopher Hitchens, Editor's Picks, life coaching, matthew hussey, the secret", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf95c\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Books, Christopher Hitchens, Editor's Picks, life coaching, matthew hussey, the secret, Life NewsLife coaching as a career is so new that at just 27, Matthew Hussey is older than the history of his profession.\nThe whole \u201cSecret\u201d sensation really rubbed me the wrong way; I just don\u2019t believe in it.\nThere are ways to be a better public speaker and I know those ways because I\u2019ve done it myself.\nWe live in a culture populated by experts, leaders and gurus who claim to know the quickest route to getting you very compelling things.\nOver a nearly three-hour lunch, Matthew and I talked about his daily life, the value of loneliness, his thoughts on \u201cThe Secret,\u201d and why some people are just so damn stupid."}
