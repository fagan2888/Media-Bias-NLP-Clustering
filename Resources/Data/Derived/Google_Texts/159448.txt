Indians finish third at FRL meet

Brooke Hansen

THORNTON — On Saturday afternoon at the Veterans Memorial Aquatic Center in Thornton, a demolition was done on the record books.

The 2015 Front Range League girls swimming and diving championships served as a personal showcase for a number of Colorado's premier teams and individuals. On a day when seven of 12 league records were shattered and foes like Fossil Ridge and Fairview flexed their muscles, Loveland had an opportunity to display their abilities, as well.

The Indians delivered.

Senior Brooke Hansen, a University of Texas signee who ranks in the top-10 in 5A in each of the seven individual events she's swam this winter, isn't always accustomed to heated competition during the season. She got it Saturday.

In the 200-yard individual medley, Hansen faced off with Fossil Ridge senior Bailey Nero, a state champion in the 100-yard butterfly a season ago and an Auburn recruit. The race lived up to its billing as a back-and-forth photo finish resulted in both girls crushing the Front Range record of 2:05.30. Hansen (2:03.42) was the runner-up to Nero (2:03.24), a bittersweet result for the Loveland stalwart.

"I wanted to win both of my races," Hansen admitted. "I need to fix a few small things before state next weekend, but overall it was a pretty good time. It was good to have someone push me, because that's what I'll see at state. I won't be winning by like 3 seconds. It was good competition."

The senior also saw good competition in the 100-freestyle from another Fossil swimmer, freshman Zoe Bartel, but Hansen finished first going away with a time of 51.25 seconds. Bartel was well back in 52.15.

"I was really happy with that time," Hansen said. "I wanted to go a 51 low, so a 51.2 was good."

She also swam the third leg of the fifth place 200-yard medley relay (1:52.05) and the opening leg of the 400 freestyle relay (3:38.03). Fossil Ridge won the 400 free in 3:31.63, the second fastest time in 5A after the weekend, but Loveland may have surprised the SaberCats a bit.

"My dad Nick, a coach, wanted us to stack the front so that we would scare Fossil a little bit and they would be a little nervous," Hansen, who, along with Kelly Hatanaka, gave Loveland a lead for a good portion of the race, explained. "We were a second off our school record. We only had one girl that was fully tapered on the relay."

Hansen embraced the competition the league meet presented.

For Loveland teammate Ashlyn Brent, the competition was within. Brent, a junior who excels in cross-country and track for the Indians and who is even a budding triathlete, decided to quit the Loveland Swim Club this past summer to pursue running more.

"It was hard, because I swam club my entire life," Brent said. "This was the one year that I decided to run. I wanted to prove to myself that I don't have to be a club swimmer just to make state."

Loveland coach Sharra Schleiger says the junior has shined on her top relays all season. But, both swimmer and coach were hoping to get Brent to state in an individual event, as well.

"She came to me worried earlier in the season and was like, 'can I make it to state?' I didn't want to give her false reasoning, but I also know who she is and how she trains as a runner," Schleiger said. "I'm not her coach for that, but I know how talented she is and how hard she works. I knew that if she put in the time and effort that she could make it. Honestly, she's a great athlete and she's not afraid to hurt and I think that, in a lot of ways, is what you see in swimming. When someone's not afraid of that pain and not afraid to work through it, you are going to see some success later on."

A day after just missing the state cut in the 500 freestyle prelims with a time of 5:34.02, Brent's hard work came to fruition in the finals as she cruised past the cut of 5:32.50 to a time of 5:31.27, good for seventh place.

Sarah Schweickart, on her birthday, had a joyous swim in the 200 IM as she inched past the qualifying standard of 2:19.50 with a 2:18.99. She also earned her spot at the state championships in her final opportunity.

Fossil Ridge, one of 5A's title favorites, cruised to another conference crown with 914.5 points. Loveland placed third with 473 points, a result coach Schleiger was more than pleased about.
