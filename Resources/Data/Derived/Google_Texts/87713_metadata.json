Barber, Innovation News, Sustainability News, News, Politics News\n\nIn 2013, the Moral Mondays movement in North Carolina caught the nation by surprise, with an escalating series of mass demonstrations and mass arrests in protest against an extreme right-wing legislative agenda.\n\nAlthough Republicans had made sweeping gains across dozens of states in 2010, and further consolidated power through redistricting after that, North Carolina was unique in both the quality and the strength of the resistance movement that emerged there. That fact alone signaled the existence of a profoundly important story that needed to be told: What made North Carolina different? What made the people there respond in a unified, caring, coherent manner that many outsiders immediately recognized as embodying key elements of the civil rights movement in a way that is often invoked in words, but too seldom in deeds?\n\nThe Rev. Dr. William J. Barber II, leader of the North Carolina NAACP, tells that story, as an unfolding of his own personal story, informed by faith, community and history, in his new memoir, \u201cThe Third Reconstruction: Moral Mondays, Fusion Politics, and the Rise of a New Justice Movement.\u201d Salon interviewed him about the book and the story it tells just two weeks before the North Carolina primary again draws national attention to the state.\n\nNationally, most people never heard of you before the Moral Mondays movement burst onto the scene in 2013, and it was seen as something similar to the 2011 response to Scott Walker in Wisconsin, as a spontaneous outpouring of resistance (though of course the strength of Wisconsin\u2019s labor movement was well known).\n\nBut the actual story is dramatically different. In a very real sense, you were actually the initiators, with a coalition formed in 2006/7, drawing inspiration and guidance from the history of the First and Second Reconstructions, specifically in North Carolina history. This helps explain the title of your book, \u201cThe Third Reconstruction,\u201d but most people don\u2019t share a common understanding of what the first two Reconstructions were about.\n\nSo could you start by explaining, first, what people need to know about the First Reconstruction, what it accomplished in North Carolina \u2014 what it showed to be possible \u2014 and the role of \u201cfusion politics.\u201dAnd, second, how it was crushed, and the lessons to be learned from that.\n\nThank you for noticing that we\u2019re looking forward by looking back. Eric Foner, one of our best historians, says that we cannot understand Reconstruction without understanding the Redemption movement that rose up against it. But it\u2019s essential to know that, right here in my home state of North Carolina, a white minister and a black minister worked together in 1868 to write the Constitution whose moral language has guided our 21st-century movement. Their language scared extremists then as much as it does now. Which is why a white supremacy campaign in the 19th century promised to \u201credeem\u201d North Carolina from Negro rule, and extremists today talk about \u201ctaking back\u201d America.\n\nSo, yes, the patterns repeat themselves. And in some ways they\u2019ve taught us to see what\u2019s coming. The Redemption movement fought back by attacking public education, voting rights and equal protection under the law. They attacked the role of government itself, insisting that white people could not pay into a system they had trusted if black people had power. Our coalition built power as they did in the late 19th century\u2014by helping people who are often pitted against each other see that we are stronger together. But we scared the extremists to death when North Carolina helped send Obama to the White House in 2008. We broke the solid South for the first time in a generation. We knew, as before, that they would attack us by any means necessary. And they have. But the amount of money they\u2019ve had to pour into the resistance is evidence to us of our success.\n\nThe Second Reconstruction is remembered primarily in terms of great historical moments of achievement, but you have a much different view\u2013one that\u2019s actually much more in keeping with those who forged it. What are the most important lessons we need to draw from the Second Reconstruction?\n\nWhen we remember the Second Reconstruction as a \u201ccivil rights movement,\u201d we reduce it to the legal victory of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. But we\u2019d already had a civil rights act in 1866\u2014almost a century earlier. In so many ways, the struggle for civil rights was a fight to gain ground we\u2019d lost in the Jim Crow era.\n\nWhat Ella Baker understood and Dr. King articulated after 1964 was that a movement mentality can push us toward a moral revolution of values. And such a revolution is essential if we are to reconstruct democracy in this country. Dr. King said he feared that black people had been integrated into a house that was burning down. Reconstruction is about becoming the country we\u2019ve not yet been, and that is the essential work of our Moral Movement today.\n\nAlthough you\u2019re writing the story of a movement, it\u2019s grounded in very personal terms. The two most important people you cite influencing your life are your father and your grandmama. If you were asked to choose one thing you learned from each, what would that be?\n\nMy father taught me the importance of scholarship, theology and movement building. He was a well-educated man and could have used his degrees to live comfortably in a city. But he brought them back to Washington County and used that knowledge to serve the community. My grandmama taught me the substance of things hoped for and the evidence of things not seen. She was a woman of deep faith, and she gave me the gift of knowing in my bones that if we are on God\u2019s side, even when we don\u2019t know how, God is going to work it out.\n\nAlthough almost all of your story takes place in North Carolina, what you describe as your \u201cfirst fight\u201d took place while you were a preacher in Virginia for three years. I\u2019d like to ask four questions: What was that fight? How did you get drawn into it? What happened? And what did you learn?\n\nA member of my church had worked her whole life for the local textile mill. When she retired, they gave her $90 and a watch. Then she died six months later. The workers at the plant wanted to start a union and they asked me to help. Seeing their struggle as a moral concern, I agreed. But I didn\u2019t realize how savvy the bosses were at dividing the community. They held separate meetings with the white ministers and the black ministers. When the company president met with the black minsters, he reminded us of all he\u2019d done for our churches over the years. Then he got up to leave. I said, \u201cWait a second; I thought we were here to talk about a union.\u201d He said, \u201cWe just did.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The right gerrymandered North Carolina with dark money.
