The owners of two for-profit companies, Hobby Lobby and Conestoga Wood Specialties, are arguing that they should be exempt from providing this type of coverage to their female employees because they have religious objections to birth control.\n\nThe Supreme Court is taking up the highly-anticipated case on March 25, and the dispute largely centers on a few basic facts about birth control that Obamacare opponents are misrepresenting. Here\u2019s what you should keep in mind as this debate heats up over the next several weeks:\n\n1. Emergency contraception is not the same thing as abortion.\n\nAt the heart of the religious objection to contraceptive coverage is the incorrect assertion that Obamacare covers \u201cabortion-inducing drugs.\u201d Abortion opponents believe that life begins at fertilization, and claim that some types of birth control \u2014 specifically, the \u201cmorning after pill,\u201d or emergency contraception \u2014 work by destroying a fertilized egg. But major medical groups actually define life as beginning at implantation, when a fertilized egg attaches to the uterine lining. This is the legal definition of pregnancy that has been accepted for decades. Scientists agree that contraceptive methods prevent pregnancy by interfering with ovulation, fertilization, or implantation.\n\nEven if conservatives still want to quibble about implantation, there\u2019s scientific evidence that emergency contraception doesn\u2019t actually disrupt this process.\n\n2. Birth control has positive health benefits for millions of women.\n\nMany of the briefs filed in support of Hobby Lobby are explicit about the apparent harm that will come to women and their families if they opt to use birth control. Opponents of Obamacare\u2019s birth control provision argue that \u201cpregnancy is not a disease\u201d and birth control coverage isn\u2019t a necessity. But this position ignores the very real positive benefits of modern contraception, and the government\u2019s interest in expanding this service to as many people as possible.\n\nNearly 100 percent of U.S. women have used birth control at some point in their lives. Preventing unintended pregnancies keeps women and their babies healthy, saves the government money, and helps women achieve financial success. Obviously, greater access to birth control also reduces women\u2019s need for abortion services. Nearly 60 percent of women have used contraception for a medical reason other than avoiding a pregnancy, too. Birth control can help prevent painful menstrual cramps, treat ovarian cysts, and lower some women\u2019s risk of certain types of cancer.\n\n3. Free birth control does not lead women to have risky sex.\n\nA common theme emerges among many of the briefs filed against the contraceptive mandate. Many of the arguments are grounded in the claim that contraception harms society by leading to promiscuity and infidelity. This has been a central component of the pushback to Obamacare outside of the courtroom, too. For instance, after Sandra Fluke testified in favor of the law\u2019s birth control coverage, conservatives bashed her for being a \u201cslut\u201d who wanted the government to finance her sex life.\n\nBut there\u2019s absolutely no evidence to support this myth about female sexuality. In fact, a recent study published in the Obstetrics & Gynecology journal tracked the sexual activity of thousands of low-income women who participated in a program that offered no-cost contraception, and found they weren\u2019t any more likely to practice risky sex. The study\u2019s authors confirmed to Media Matters that they wanted to study the supposed \u201clink\u201d between birth control and promiscuity to provide some data for the unsubstantiated claims swirling around this Obamacare provision.\n\n4. Most religious women use birth control.\n\nThe \u201creligious liberty\u201d arguments in the upcoming Supreme Court case actually represent an extremely unorthodox definition of that term. By arguing that for-profit companies should have the right to deny coverage for specific health services from their female employees, these businesses are essentially using religion as a cloak to avoid following the law. \u201cReligious liberty is not about harming others and imposing your religion on them,\u201d Sharon Levin, the director of federal reproductive rights policy for the National Women\u2019s Law Center, told ThinkProgress in a recent interview.\n\nFurthermore, religion is not inherently in conflict with contraception. Most religious Americans use birth control at the same rates as non-religious Americans do, including among the people who frequently attend church services. More than 80 percent of Catholics believe that birth control is \u201cmorally acceptable.\u201d And not all church groups are opposed to this aspect of the health law. \u201cIn real-life America, contraceptive use and strong religious beliefs are highly compatible,\u201d Rachel K. Jones, a researcher with the Guttmacher Institute, points out.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "This month, the Supreme Court is taking up a highly-anticipated case that largely centers on arguments against birth control that aren't based in fact.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "This month, the Supreme Court is taking up a highly-anticipated case that largely centers on arguments against birth control that aren't based in fact.", "title": "4 Basic Facts To Remember Before The Supreme Court Hears A Major Case About Birth Control", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/03/12/3395111/basic-birth-control-facts-supreme-court/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/birthcontrol-e1378403030247.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "This month, the Supreme Court is taking up a highly-anticipated case that largely centers on arguments against birth control that aren't based in fact.", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/birthcontrol-e1378403008311-321x214.jpeg", "title": "4 Basic Facts To Remember Before The Supreme Court Hears A Major Case About Birth Control", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/birthcontrol-e1378403030247.jpeg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/birthcontrol-e1378403030247.jpeg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-03-12T12:16:27+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Opponents of Obamacare\u2019s birth control provision argue that \u201cpregnancy is not a disease\u201d and birth control coverage isn\u2019t a necessity.\nThe Supreme Court is taking up the highly-anticipated case on March 25, and the dispute largely centers on a few basic facts about birth control that Obamacare opponents are misrepresenting.\nHealth 4 Basic Facts To Remember Before The Supreme Court Hears A Major Case About Birth Control CREDIT: ShutterstockLater this month, the highest court in the United States will hear two religious challenges to Obamacare\u2019s contraceptive coverage requirement.\nBirth control can help prevent painful menstrual cramps, treat ovarian cysts, and lower some women\u2019s risk of certain types of cancer.\nMost religious women use birth control."}
