Tom Harkin (D-IA) at his annual Iowa Steak Fry fundraiser on Sunday, just days after Harkin made controversial remarks dismissing the Islamic State (ISIS) terror threat as mere \u201cfear-mongering.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fear-mongering. It\u2019s what happened after 9/11. \u2018Oh my God, they\u2019ve got these planes crashing. Now they\u2019re going to take over America.\u2019 That\u2019s nonsense,\u201d said Harkin to the Huffington Post.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nHarkin added, \u201cWe overreacted to 9/11. Most of the people that did 9/11 were Saudis. Why the hell didn\u2019t we invade Saudi Arabia? There wasn\u2019t one Iraqi involved in 9/11,\u201d said Harkin. \u201cWe just keep jumping from one mistake to another. I have a feeling we\u2019re going to do the same thing with the [Islamic State.]\u201d\n\nHillary Clinton has yet to comment on Harkin\u2019s remarks.\n\nHarkin did not endorse a Hillary presidential candidacy but praised her, telling the crowd she was a \u201crock star\u201d when she landed in the Senate and that she deserves ample credit for paving the way for President Barack Obama\u2019s unpopular health care overhaul, Obamacare.\n\n\u201cHer fingerprints are all over that legislation [Obamacare],\u201d said Harkin.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hillary Clinton Silent on Sen.
