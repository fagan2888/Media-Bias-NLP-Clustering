She said there is not a set date for bargaining, but that Kaiser is \"open to bargain any time they ask us.\"\n\nSIGN UP for the free California Inc. business newsletter >>\n\nThe union represents about 75% of the nurses at the Kaiser hospital. The Kaiser nurses joined the California Nurses Assn. last year and they are seeking their first collective bargaining contract.\n\nAisha Ealey, a registered nurse in the neo-natal intensive care unit at Los Angeles Medical Center and a union member, said the hospital is understaffed and that nurses have to \"float\" to other units where they are not as knowledgeable.\n\nShe said staffing levels are especially critical at Los Angeles Medical Center because it is a \"tertiary hospital\" that treats some of the sickest Kaiser patients with specialized care.\n\n\"We need more staff,\" Ealey said. \"We need qualified nurses.\"\n\nIn a statement, Kaiser said its nursing staff ratios meet or exceed California state guidelines.\n\n\"We do not float any nurse to any other department unless they have been given orientation to that department, and they must always have the clinical skills necessary for that department,\" Clausen said in an interview.\n\nThe union is also calling for a restructured benefits package and higher wages. Smith said there has not been a pay increase since 2011.\n\nKaiser said it has proposed wages for the nurses that would \"keep them among the best paid nurses in Southern California.\"\n\nClausen said Kaiser gave nurses \"a very generous offer\" that would be at par with the rest of the Southern California Kaiser Permanente hospitals. She said the increase would put the nurses 20% higher than the rest of the Southern California market.\n\nDemand for healthcare staff services was expected to grow, on average, about 6.6% each year from 2014 through 2016, according to a 2015 report by investment bank Harris Williams & Co. on the healthcare staffing market.\n\nThe report attributed the increase to the Affordable Care Act, aging Baby Boomers and ongoing nursing and health professional shortages.\n\nFor more business news, follow @smasunaga.\n\nALSO\n\nTravel and tourism added 7.2 million jobs worldwide in 2015\n\nApple\u2019s events are getting as predictable as the company.
