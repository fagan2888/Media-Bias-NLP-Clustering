In the late 19th century, young American heiresses exchanged their wealth for titles, marrying into the European elite. One such heiress was Clara Ward, who was born in Detroit in 1873. She married a Belgian Prince, becoming Princesse de Caraman-Chimay, but Clara\u2019s story is no traditional fairy tale.\n\nJoe Grimm joins Current State to tell us more about Clara\u2019s unconventional life.
