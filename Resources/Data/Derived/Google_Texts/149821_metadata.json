Arrowhead has been providing care for the uninsured.\n\nSAN BERNARDINO >> Doctors don\u2019t make house calls anymore, but for much of San Bernardino County, a rolling clinic regularly visits underserved neighborhood locations from Yucaipa to Ontario.\n\nArrowhead Regional Medical Center, the county hospital, funds and operates a 40-foot Medical Mobile Clinic that features two functional private exam rooms and a health education area.\n\nMost of the patients they see don\u2019t speak English, don\u2019t have health insurance and haven\u2019t seen a doctor for years.\n\nThe program has grown from 360 patients in 2012 to 1,700 last year, said Eda Gemmell, an RN at the clinic since 2012.\n\nThe county budget for the program is about $330,000 this fiscal year, officials said.\n\nAt a recent clinic stop at the Ruben Campos Community Center, 1717 W. Fifth St., in San Bernardino, Angelena Rivas, 66, and Genaro Garcia, 64, were among the patients to be seen.\n\nThe couple does not have medical insurance and does not qualify for programs created by the Affordable Care Act.\n\nSpeaking through an interpreter, Garcia said he is working with the clinic\u2019s medical staff to reduce his high cholesterol levels while Rivas said she has been having significant pain in both knees.\n\nThe couple said they come to the clinic for their primary care previously and would have walked to it, except Rivas\u2019 knee issues made that option impractical.\n\nAnother patient, Juanita Muniz, 27, brought her three young children.\n\nBut she, not the children, would be the patient on that day.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a baby sitter,\u201d she said, adding that she walked to the clinic, which was near her home.\n\nIt had been several years since she had seen a doctor and she thought a check-up would be a good idea.\n\nThe children are covered by health insurance, but she has none.\n\n\u201cIt is refreshing to know an entity affiliated with the county is treating (the poor, disenfranchised) westside (San Bernardino) residents with such courtesy and respect,\u201d said Ericka Flores, a community organizer with the Center for Community Action and Environmental Justice.\n\nThe Riverside County-based CAEJ has an office at the Ruben Campos Community Center and its members are present when the mobile clinic arrives, to provide a familiar face to the patients, who might have anxiety about a medical visit, Flores said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe (mobile clinic) staff is wonderful.\u201d Flores said.\n\n\u201cIt was the residents who learned about the clinic and wanted it to stop at the Ruben Campos center,\u201d she said.\n\nCAEJ and residents talked with ARMC officials to bring the clinic to that location.\n\nSince its inception, seven breast cancer cases and one colon cancer have been diagnosed in early stages by mobile clinic staff, Gemmell said.\n\nOn this day, Dr. Siraj Mowjood was the attending physician overseeing two young doctors in ARMC\u2019s family medicine residency program.\n\nDr. Anushree Gupta, in the second year of the three-year family medicine residency program, said she likes working in the mobile clinic because it has \u201csuch a mix of patients and medical problems.\u201d\n\nPatients can be senior citizens, pregnant women or children, she said.\n\nMowjood said often clinic health professionals detect chronic conditions, such as high blood pressure or diabetes, that have likely been present for years, but unknown to the patient.\n\nResidents get the experience of educating their patients and working with them to manage their newly discovered conditions, he said.\n\nOn days when the residents are not there, a nurse practitioner heads up the medical side of the program. Gemmell said.\n\nThe clinic works mostly by appointment, although it does accept walk-ins, she said.\n\nPrimary care services offered by the rolling clinic include cholesterol screenings and other lab tests. diabetic care and treatment of acute and chronic illnesses, immunizations, mammograms and other womens\u2019 medical services, and well child checks.\n\nTo find out more information about the mobile clinic or schedule and appointment call 909-520-1207.", "article_metadata": {"description": "SAN BERNARDINO >> Doctors don\u2019t make house calls anymore, but for much of San Bernardino County, a rolling clinic regularly visits underserved neighborhood locations from Yucaipa to Ontario.Arrowhead Regional Medical Center, the co", "title": "San Bernardino County mobile clinic provides medicine to the uninsured", "og": {"url": "http://www.sbsun.com/article/LG/20140519/NEWS/140519372", "image": {"width": "1500px", "identifier": "http://www.sbsun.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/LG/20140519/NEWS/140519372/AR/0/AR-140519372.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "1106px"}, "type": "article", "title": "San Bernardino County mobile clinic provides medicine to the uninsured"}, "twitter": {"domain": "sbsun.com", "description": "SAN BERNARDINO >> Doctors don\u2019t make house calls anymore, but for much of San Bernardino County, a rolling clinic regularly visits underserved neighborhood locations from Yucaipa to Ontario.Arrowhead Regional Medical Center, the co", "title": "San Bernardino County mobile clinic provides medicine to the uninsured", "url": "http://www.sbsun.com/article/LG/20140519/NEWS/140519372", "image": {"src": "http://www.sbsun.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/LG/20140519/NEWS/140519372/AR/0/AR-140519372.jpg?Maxh=900&Maxw=900"}, "site": "@sbsun", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id563372734", "iphone": "id503662617", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.sanbernardinosun"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "keywords": "Arrowhead Regional Medical Center,Colton Joint Unified School District,San Bernardino, Public health", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Arrowhead Regional Medical Center,Colton Joint Unified School District,San Bernardino, Public health"}, "article_summary": "Arrowhead Regional Medical Center, the county hospital, funds and operates a 40-foot Medical Mobile Clinic that features two functional private exam rooms and a health education area.\nTo find out more information about the mobile clinic or schedule and appointment call 909-520-1207.\nSince its inception, seven breast cancer cases and one colon cancer have been diagnosed in early stages by mobile clinic staff, Gemmell said.\nSAN BERNARDINO >> Doctors don\u2019t make house calls anymore, but for much of San Bernardino County, a rolling clinic regularly visits underserved neighborhood locations from Yucaipa to Ontario.\nAdvertisement\u201cThe (mobile clinic) staff is wonderful.\u201d Flores said."}
