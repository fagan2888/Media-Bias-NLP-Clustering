Today, some people label him a fascist.\n\nThere was a point in time when Trump apparently fully supported abortion rights, universal healthcare and a ban on assault weapons; he even proposed legalizing all drugs.\n\nNow, he says he\u2019s vehemently pro-life and anti-Obamacare, and he says the Second Amendment will be \u201ctotally protected\u201d if he becomes president.\n\nIndeed, Trump flip-flopped numerous times over the past several decades in multiple respects.\n\nHe was a registered Republican from 1987 to 1999, then registered as an Independent and, in August 2001, registered as a Democrat. In 2009, he registered as a Republican again, then an Independent in 2011 and back to a Republican in 2012.\n\nThere\u2019s also the matter of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Over the summer, Trump said Clinton was the \u201cworst secretary of state in the history of the United States\u201d and would make a \u201cterrible president.\u201d\n\nThis stands in stark contrast with his opinion of her in the past. Not long ago, Trump frequently praised Hillary Clinton.\n\nAs BuzzFeed reports, back in 2008 \u2014 less than a decade ago \u2014 he blogged Hillary would make a \u201cgreat president.\u201d\n\nRead a segment of the blog post below where Trump wrote, \u201cI know Hillary and I think she\u2019d make a great president or vice president.\u201d Click here for the full post.\n\nEither Trump changed his mind about Clinton, or he\u2019s not being totally honest.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, as Politico highlights, state and federal disclosure records show Trump and his son donated to Clinton on several occasions: 2002, 2005, 2006 and 2007. He also reportedly donated around $100,000 to the Clinton Foundation.\n\nIn Trump\u2019s defense, Hillary Clinton also has a history of flip-flopping on issues. Most politicians, in some way or another, are opportunists. They say what they think people want to hear, rather than what they truly feel or believe.\n\nBut not all politicians propose things like banning all Muslim immigration to the US as Trump did.\n\nEven if Trump is just a demagogue, his rhetoric is arguably dangerous.\n\nSubscribe to Elite Daily's official newsletter, The Edge, for more stories you don\u2019t want to miss.", "article_metadata": {"description": "He used to be quite liberal on many issues.", "og": {"site_name": "Elite Daily", "description": "He used to be quite liberal on many issues.", "title": "Donald Trump Used To Think Hillary Clinton Would Be A 'Great President'", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn29.elitedaily.com/content/uploads/2015/12/29124638/elite-daily-donald-trump-.jpg", "url": "http://elitedaily.com/news/politics/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-great-president/1331405/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Elite Daily", "description": "He used to be quite liberal on many issues.", "title": "Donald Trump Used To Think Hillary Clinton Would Be A \u2018Great President\u2019", "image": {"src": "http://cdn29.elitedaily.com/content/uploads/2015/12/29124638/elite-daily-donald-trump-.jpg"}, "creator": "@jchaltiwanger", "site": "@EliteDaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"web": {"url": "http://elitedaily.com/news/politics/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-great-president/1331405/"}, "ios": {"url": "http://elitedaily.com/news/politics/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-great-president/1331405/", "app_store_id": 1032458504, "app_name": "Elite Daily"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 378366428966386}, "keywords": "donald trump,", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/EliteDaily", "section": "News", "tag": "2016 presidential election,donald trump,hillary clinton", "published_time": "2015-12-29T14:14:31+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/john.couch.haltiwanger"}, "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://www.elitestatic.com/content/themes/strangelove/images/apple_favicon.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "donald trump,"}, "article_summary": "In Trump\u2019s defense, Hillary Clinton also has a history of flip-flopping on issues.\nHe was a registered Republican from 1987 to 1999, then registered as an Independent and, in August 2001, registered as a Democrat.\nNot long ago, Trump frequently praised Hillary Clinton.\nRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump is a very fickle man.\nThere\u2019s also the matter of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton."}
