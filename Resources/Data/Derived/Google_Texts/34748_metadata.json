(Photo by Walt Mancini/Pasadena Star-News)\n\nTwo of Southern California\u2019s leading child welfare agencies are planning to merge their operations.\n\nThe boards of directors for Hillsides and Bienvenidos signed a memorandum of understanding last week that will allow them to consolidate their resources and offer expanded services to at-risk children and their families.\n\nPasadena-based Hillsides serves more than 6,240 children and families throughout Los Angeles County via its 26 locations which include school-based mental health offices in Pasadena, Los Angeles and Baldwin Park unified school districts.\n\nBienvenidos, headquartered in Los Angeles, serves 7,000 children and families, operating its programs out of nine locations in East Los Angeles and San Gabriel Valley. That includes licensed foster homes that serve Los Angeles, Orange, San Bernardino and Riverside counties.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been looking at doing this since October,\u201d said Joseph M. Costa, Hillsides\u2019 chief executive officer. \u201cWe both have very similar missions. When you look at our leadership at the board level and our executives management folks, we all came into this work with the same kind of sentiment \u2014 to improve the lives of kids and their families who are vulnerable.\u201d\n\nHillsides and Bienvenidos will retain their individual names with Bienvenidos becoming an affiliate of Hillsides.\n\nThe merger is being driven by the Continuum of Care Reform legislation (AB 403), the Affordable Care Act, the integration of Los Angeles County\u2019s health and behavioral health services and the creation of a Nonprofit Sustainability Initiative by Los Angeles area foundations to encourage increased collaboration.\n\n\u201cThe greatest benefit will be in terms of infrastructure,\u201d Costa said. \u201cThis will allow us to have a relatively robust and expanded infrastructure while not spending any more dollars on administrative services. The county sees us as principle partners with them in child and family care.\u201d\n\nHillsides provides parenting classes, mental health support and additional resources for vulnerable children and families. The agency also offers residential treatment for children who suffered trauma or have severe emotional or behavioral challenges, and individualized education for students with emotional, learning and/or behavior challenges.\n\nHillsides also runs a Youth Moving On program that provides former foster youth with affordable housing and other support services so they can become self-sufficient.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCosta noted that Bienvenidos offers a foster family and adoption program, which Hillsides doesn\u2019t have. But AB 403 calls for the establishment of \u201cresource\u201d families that would function much like foster families, although the goal would be to stabilize the child and the child\u2019s family so they could be reunited in a healthier environment.\n\n\u201cThis is a real innovation,\u201d he said.\n\nBienvenidos President and CEO Ritchie L. Geisel said the agencies\u2019 combined resources and workforce of 600 will increase their impact in L.A. County and surrounding counties.\n\n\u201cOur clients\u2019 resilience and resolve to improve their lives inspire us every day to further our collective mission,\u201d Geisel said.\n\nWith an annual operating budget of $32 million, more than 90 percent Hillsides\u2019 funding comes from contracts with the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services, the county Department of Mental Health and area school districts that have contracts with the agency. The remaining 10 percent comes from private foundations, individual donors and special fund-raising events.\n\nBienvenidos draws its funding from many of the same public sources and has an annual budget of $16 million.\n\nCosta said the merger should be finalized by the end of the year.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a process we have to go through that has to do with the assignment of contracts to Hillsides by various public entities that have agreements with Bienvenidos,\u201d he said. \u201cThat will take several months and we have to meet with staff and do planning. And at some point we need to come together as one board. It should be completed by the end of the calendar year.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Two of Southern California\u2019s leading child welfare agencies are planning to merge their operations.The boards of directors for Hillsides and Bienvenidos signed", "title": "Why 2 San Gabriel Valley child welfare agencies plan to merge", "og": {"url": "http://www.pasadenastarnews.com/social-affairs/20160418/why-2-san-gabriel-valley-child-welfare-agencies-plan-to-merge", "image": {"width": "1500px", "identifier": "http://www.pasadenastarnews.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/LD/20160418/NEWS/160419451/AR/0/AR-160419451.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "975px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Why 2 San Gabriel Valley child welfare agencies plan to merge"}, "twitter": {"domain": "pasadenastarnews.com", "description": "Two of Southern California\u2019s leading child welfare agencies are planning to merge their operations.The boards of directors for Hillsides and Bienvenidos signed", "title": "Why 2 San Gabriel Valley child welfare agencies plan to merge", "url": "http://www.pasadenastarnews.com/social-affairs/20160418/why-2-san-gabriel-valley-child-welfare-agencies-plan-to-merge", "image": {"src": "http://www.pasadenastarnews.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/LD/20160418/NEWS/160419451/AR/0/AR-160419451.jpg?Maxh=900&Maxw=900"}, "site": "@PasStarNews", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id563965297", "iphone": "id503656700", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.pasadenastarnews"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "keywords": "Hillsides,merger,Pasadena,welfare agencies, Child welfare", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Hillsides,merger,Pasadena,welfare agencies, Child welfare"}, "article_summary": "Bienvenidos, headquartered in Los Angeles, serves 7,000 children and families, operating its programs out of nine locations in East Los Angeles and San Gabriel Valley.\nThat includes licensed foster homes that serve Los Angeles, Orange, San Bernardino and Riverside counties.\n(Photo by Walt Mancini/Pasadena Star-News)Two of Southern California\u2019s leading child welfare agencies are planning to merge their operations.\nPasadena-based Hillsides serves more than 6,240 children and families throughout Los Angeles County via its 26 locations which include school-based mental health offices in Pasadena, Los Angeles and Baldwin Park unified school districts.\nBut AB 403 calls for the establishment of \u201cresource\u201d families that would function much like foster families, although the goal would be to stabilize the child and the child\u2019s family so they could be reunited in a healthier environment."}
