Did you ever see a migration like that? They\u2019re all men. And they\u2019re all strong looking guys,\u201d said Trump, who wondered why the refugees weren\u2019t staying and fighting for their county.\n\n\u201cThis could be one of the great tactical ploys of all time. A 200,000-man army, maybe,\u201d he added. \u201cThat could be possible. I don\u2019t know that it is, but it could be possible.\u201d\n\nEarlier last month Secretary of State John Kerry announced the U.S. would dramatically boost the number of refugees over the next few years, with 85,000 next year and up to 100,000 in 2017.\n\nRelated: Can the U.S. Handle 100,000 Syrian Refugees?\n\nThe plan faces significant resistance on Capitol Hill, where top GOP lawmakers have expressed concerns about the effort. They argue the U.S. doesn\u2019t have the right security procedures in place to adequately vet refugees and determine if they pose a security risk.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Trump didn\u2019t say how he would expel the migrants.\n\n\u201cIf they come, that\u2019s great. If I lose, I guess they\u2019re staying,\u201d he said.\n\nHis remarks quickly became fodder for one of his chief presidential rivals.\n\nRelated: Why Europe\u2019s Migrant Crisis Also Belongs to America\n\n\u201c[W]e have Donald Trump saying that refugees need to be sent back. If he's elected president, he'll just round them all up and send them back. This is not an America that I believe is the one that will create peace and security,\u201d former Florida Governor Jeb Bush said Thursday during an interview with MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you're interested in fighting Islamic terrorism over the long haul, we cannot allow this to stand pat,\u201d he added. \u201cThese refugee camps will be breeding grounds for disillusioned people that are going to end up creating problems for us.\u201d\n\nBush, who has spent weeks trying to regain his frontrunner status from Trump, chided the real estate mogul\u2019s strategy for dealing with crisis as \u201cnot a serious plan.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is typical of Mr. Trump,\u201d said Bush, who expanded his comments to indict Trump\u2019s whole approach to immigration. \u201cHe's going to take all the Syrian refugees back whenever they come. He's going to, in two years\u2019 time, remove 12 million people from our country. That's a half a million people a year. The cost of that, the lack of civil liberties, the disruptive nature of that is just not realistic and ultimately, people are going to begin to see these things.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Immigrants from Mexico are not the only people who would be deported under a Donald Trump administration: migrants fleeing the violence in Iraq and Syria would get the boot, too.", "title": "Trump: Syrian Refugees Could Be an ISIS Ploy, Should Be Sent Back", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/01/Trump-Syrian-Refugees-Could-Be-ISIS-Ploy-Should-Be-Sent-Back", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/trump_syria_refugee_split.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/01/Trump-Syrian-Refugees-Could-Be-ISIS-Ploy-Should-Be-Sent-Back", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/trump_syria_refugee_split.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Immigrants from Mexico are not the only people who would be deported under a Donald Trump administration: migrants fleeing the violence in Iraq and Syria would get the boot, too.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "\u201cIf I win, they're going back.\u201dRelated: Kerry Wants to Accept More Syrian Refugees, but Will Congress Allow It?\n\u201cHe's going to take all the Syrian refugees back whenever they come.\nHandle 100,000 Syrian Refugees?\nRelated: Why Europe\u2019s Migrant Crisis Also Belongs to America\u201c[W]e have Donald Trump saying that refugees need to be sent back.\nAnd they\u2019re all strong looking guys,\u201d said Trump, who wondered why the refugees weren\u2019t staying and fighting for their county."}
