I am a Christian, a Republican, I am pro-life and pro-traditional marriage. I used to be able to discuss those things without fear of reprisals. But traditional beliefs are now considered ’hate speech’ in many places, and those who espouse them are labeled anti-freedom of choice, homophobes, bigots and dangerous extremists.

I do not hate anyone. In fact, my Christian faith demands that I make a concentrated effort to love everyone, because all people are precious to God. I have had, and still have, gay friends and acquaintances. Of course, gay couples should have all the protections and benefits that heterosexual couples have. But changing the definition of marriage, which has been universally recognized for thousands of years, is a bad idea that will have unintended consequences.

I do not want to force anyone to think as I do, but I will defend my right to have my opinions and religious beliefs without being persecuted for them. We used to be a country in which the free flow of ideas was welcome. We could agree to disagree and still discuss our differences. But now, all discussion is shut down by name-calling and personal attacks. With regard to abortion and gay marriage, we are told, ’It’s the law of the land, get over it!’

Get over what? Must we abandon our religious beliefs because something is ’the law of the land?’ Slavery was once ’the law of the land.’ Not all Supreme Court decisions are good.

I am not an activist. I would just like to live my life as a Christian and be able to share my faith without being labeled a fanatical extremist. Is that too much to ask?

Raising state's standards

Ron Moers, in his letter to the editor, admonished Gov. Brian Sandoval for signing legislation that increases the tax burden of businesses in Nevada ("Sandoval fails prevailing wage math," July 9 Review-Journal). Nevada has been at the bottom of every good list and at the top of every bad one, so it's obvious Mr. Moers is not a big fan of bringing the state out of the dark ages.

The educational needs of this state have not been adequately addressed since the 1960s. We need to give Republicans in the 2015 Legislature credit for their efforts, because unlike the Democrats who held the Assembly majority since 1985, Republicans jumped in and did the right thing.

Mr. Moers also complained about Gov. Sandoval signing a bill that allowed prevailing wage measures to stand. The prevailing wage is something Mr. Moers and a great many Republicans don’t seem to understand. Prevailing wage laws are all about setting standards that regulate what workers are paid, hours of work, safety issues and benefits. Prevailing wage laws are also about setting a bar that says we as a people are not about racing to the bottom, that we want contractors from our state who hire our citizens to do the work.

By hiring Nevada-based contractors, we put our neighbors, friends and family members to work on jobs their taxes paid for in the first place, keeping that tax revenue in the community.

Trumps tells truth

Finally, we have a candidate who speaks the truth. Donald Trump tells it like it is. Our borders are like a sieve. Anyone can walk across, regardless of whether they have a criminal record, are drug dealers, terrorists, have contagious diseases or are just hoping for a better life here in the U.S.

We have no way to tell who crosses the border, because the federal government does nothing to stop the flood of people entering our country. Mr. Trump mentioned that most of these people are from Mexico or come through Mexico from other countries. Mexico does nothing to help this situation. Mexican officials don't seem to care, as long as the problem is ours and not theirs. This is the truth.

Mr. Trump did not say all Hispanics were bad people; in fact, he said he loved the Mexican people. What he did say is that we need to control the influx of people coming into this country by building a wall, and that Mexico should pay for it. Right now, Mexico pays for nothing.

I think Mr. Trump is the kind of man we need as president — someone with a backbone who will put the country back on its feet with jobs, and someone other countries will respect. We need a Donald Trump.

Obamacare? Americare

On the 50th anniversary of Medicare this month, we should correct a health care misnomer. Let's stop referring to the Affordable Care Act as Obamacare. We don't call Social Security "Roosevelt Security." We don't call Medicare "Johnsoncare." So let's call the ACA what it is: Americare!
