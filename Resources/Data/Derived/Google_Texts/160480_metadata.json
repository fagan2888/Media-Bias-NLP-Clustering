If those pesky religious types would just go away, the left could get on with building a heaven on earth, where \u201cenlightened\u201d ruling elites manage the masses.\n\nBut resistance continues. Cases in point are the Catholic and Protestant defiance of the Obamacare abortifacient mandate, and this past week\u2019s promise of civil disobedience by dozens of conservative religious leaders against any Supreme Court ruling \u201cwhich will force us to violate a clear biblical understanding of marriage solely as the union of one man and one woman.\u201d\n\nAs the signers of the Open Letter to the Supreme Court remind the justices, who will shortly rule in Obergefell v. Hodges, \u201cAny judicial opinion which purports to redefine marriage will constitute an unjust law, as Martin Luther King, Jr. described such laws in his letter from the Birmingham Jail.\u201d\n\nBut where did the idea of \u201cunjust\u201d laws, liberty and limitations on the state arise?\n\nThe popular view taught in public schools by an aggressively secular media, and even by liberal churchmen, has been that human freedom arrived with the Renaissance, after the Roman Empire collapsed in the fifth century A.D. and after another thousand dark years of Christendom.\n\nIn fact, Medieval times in Europe were dubbed \u201cthe Dark Ages,\u201d as if no civilizing light was permitted to shine. It\u2019s been a massive libel against an entire age.\n\nIt was in the so-called Dark Ages that the torch of liberty was lit, and it burned into the conflagration that forced King John to sign the Magna Carta at Runnymede, England. The Magna Carta is the grandfather to America\u2019s Constitution and every other government-limiting compact, and it\u2019s based on Christian-informed Medieval concepts of \u201cDeity, nature, man and government,\u201d as noted by the late M. Stanton Evans in his remarkable book, \u201cThe Theme Is Freedom.\u201d\n\nThe eight-centuries-old document did a number of things beyond freeing the feudal lords from the king\u2019s claim to absolute power.\n\n\u201cMagna Carta is a lengthy catalogue of safeguards against the abuse of power, guarantees of religious liberties, legal rights, taxation by consent, and so on,\u201d Evans writes. \u201cThese form the basis of much of what was embodied in the Common Law, by which the liberties of Englishmen (and Americans) were tenaciously defended.\u201d\n\nFar from being a secular product, the Magna Carta was inspired largely by Archbishop Stephen Langton, who subscribed to Jesus\u2019 famous \u201crender unto Caesar\u201d limitation on state power and took a dim view of Lex Regis \u2014 absolute rule by the king.\n\nWe\u2019re often reminded that democracy originated in Greece \u2014 a pagan society pre-dating Jesus. The Greeks certainly contributed to the Western concept of self-government, but, \u201ccontrary to the standard history the pagan world was not even close to understanding our approach to freedom,\u201d Evans writes. \u201cThe era in which these notions were assembled into the edifice of freedom was, precisely, the Middle Ages,\u201d whose \u201cforemost political concept\u201d was \u201cconstitutionalism \u2014 establishing limits on the power of kings, and on the scope of government in general.\u201d\n\nKing George III, like other royals during and just after the Renaissance, had violated the American colonists\u2019 rights as Englishmen as established by the Magna Carta and expanded through the Common Law\u2019s constitutionalism.\n\nAmerica\u2019s revolution, as explained by Thomas Jefferson in the Declaration of Independence, was an effort to re-establish \u201cthe laws of Nature and Nature\u2019s God\u201d against the whims of an absolute ruler.\n\nBy contrast, the French Revolution, the fountainhead of socialism, communism and state primacy, was founded on atheism. It ended with guillotines and blood in the streets as the revolution eventually ate even its own.\n\nToday\u2019s cultural conceit is that we\u2019re somehow past all this, and that arguments over Obamacare, executive power and \u201cgay marriage\u201d are just speed bumps on the way to an evolving society of equality, led by our cultural betters. If religion gets in the way, well, something\u2019s got to give.\n\nLong before the Rev. King wrote his famous jail epistle, the great British jurist William Blackstone plainly outlined the two kingdoms in conflict \u2014 and which should prevail: \u201cThis law of nature dictated by God himself, is of course superior in obligation to any other. It is binding over all the globe, in all countries, and at all times: No human laws are of any validity, if contrary to this.\u201d\n\nThe Supreme Court justices would do well to ponder this, as expressed in a more contemporary fashion by Clint Eastwood\u2019s \u201cDirty Harry\u201d: \u201cA man\u2019s got to know his limitations.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Robert Knight is a senior fellow for the American Civil Rights Union and a Washington Times contributor.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Exactly 800 years after the signing of the Magna Carta on June 15, 1215, the church-state question is still very much front-page news.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Exactly 800 years after the signing of the Magna Carta on June 15, 1215, the church-state question is still very much front-page news.", "title": "ROBERT KNIGHT: The Magna Carta\u2019s message to the Supreme Court", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jun/14/robert-knight-the-magna-cartas-message-to-the-supr/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/03/04/a822b22523fdc20a6f0f6a7067002baa.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/03/04/a822b22523fdc20a6f0f6a7067002baa.jpg", "description": "Exactly 800 years after the signing of the Magna Carta on June 15, 1215, the church-state question is still very much front-page news.", "card": "summary", "title": "ROBERT KNIGHT: The Magna Carta\u2019s message to the Supreme Court"}, "Author": "Robert Knight", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Religion Belief, Supreme Court, Martin Luther King   Jr, M Stanton Evans"}, "article_summary": "ANALYSIS/OPINION:Exactly 800 years after the signing of the Magna Carta on June 15, 1215, the church-state question is still very much front-page news.\nThat\u2019s because the left\u2019s ongoing hostility toward religious freedom and its pursuit of a radically secular agenda keeps bumping up against principled opposition.\nIt was in the so-called Dark Ages that the torch of liberty was lit, and it burned into the conflagration that forced King John to sign the Magna Carta at Runnymede, England.\n\u201cMagna Carta is a lengthy catalogue of safeguards against the abuse of power, guarantees of religious liberties, legal rights, taxation by consent, and so on,\u201d Evans writes.\nIn fact, Medieval times in Europe were dubbed \u201cthe Dark Ages,\u201d as if no civilizing light was permitted to shine."}
