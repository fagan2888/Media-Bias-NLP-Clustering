As described in a previous post, what\u2019s known today as PTSD has been observed in people who experienced traumatic events for centuries if not millennia. One relatively common event that can cause PTSD is a serious injury, like from a car accident or a gunshot wound. There are a lot of those. A study of 2,707 surgical trauma patients from across the United States several years ago found that more than a fifth had PTSD one year after their injury.\n\nSo why isn\u2019t PTSD screening and referral to treatment the standard of care in trauma centers? Lois Beckett and colleagues have set out to answer just that question. In a group of articles for ProPublica, the nonprofit investigative journalism site, they examine why trauma centers, of which there are quite a few locally, don\u2019t sufficiently address the mental health consequences of traumatic injuries and the burden of PTSD among civilian populations \u2013 with a detailed look at the issue in Philadelphia (deep into the piece).\n\nTheir work, which is part of a larger series on guns, includes a survey of personnel at 21 trauma centers across the country that asks what, if anything, they do to address PTSD among their patients. The responses \u2013 Temple University Hospital said it is developing a program \u2013 are posted.\n\nBeckett spent time talking to folks at Healing Hurt People, a program I work for at Drexel University's Center for Nonviolence and Social Justice. It provides trauma-focused services to violently injured patients treated at Hahnemann University Hospital and St. Christopher\u2019s Hospital for Children. (Our own research found that 75% of program participants had PTSD four to six weeks after their injury).\n\nWhat we see there is reflected in ProPublica's illuminating articles.\n\nRead more about The Public's Health.", "article_metadata": {"pubdate": 20160527, "editdate": "20140306T03:30:00", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/public_health/What-common-trauma-injury-isnt-treated-at-trauma-centers-PTSD.html", "image": "http://media.philly.com/images/20081116_inq_jtrauma16z-b.JPG", "site": "@phillydotcom", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "What common trauma injury isn't treated at trauma centers?
