( Dan Barker / Fort Morgan Times )\n\nJustin Veeman shows his pig handling skills, which will be part of the judging when he enters it in the Morgan County Fair. (Dan Barker / Fort Morgan Times)\n\nJustin, 13, and Jessica Veeman, 16, have plenty on their hands raising multiple animals for the Morgan County Fair this year.\n\nJustin is planning to show a steer he named \"Buddy,\" three pigs named \"Sugar,\" \"Stitch\" and \"Hermes,\" and a dairy heifer named \"Mimi.\"\n\nJessica will show four pigs, \"Lilo,\" \"Charlotte,\" \"Wilbur\" and \"Zorro,\" plus two steers named \"Panda\" and \"Neo,\" a dairy heifer named \"Demi\" and a lamb named \"Jeris.\"\n\nThey've had some good success over the years with their animals. Jessica won grand champion for a dairy cow two years ago, and won reserve grand champion with a pig at the Colorado State Fair, among other honors.\n\nJustin has won first place in class a couple of times with dairy cows.\n\nJessica Veeman takes her lamb for a walk at her home near the Veeman Dairy. This is the first year she will show a lamb, but this is her seventh year in 4-H. (Dan Barker/ Fort Morgan Times)\n\nAnd they frequently make the livestock sale, which is where the big money comes in.\n\n\"We're both like animal people,\" Jessica said.\n\nGrowing up next to a dairy, showing dairy cows came naturally, but when she saw all the different kinds of animals at the county fair, she just had to try raising them, too, she said.\n\n\"I love 'em all,\" Jessica said.\n\nThis is her first year raising a lamb, and that has been a lot of fun, she said.\n\nThis is Justin's first year showing a steer, and it was not as much of a challenge as he expected, since he is used to handling big dairy cows, he said.\n\nIt's exciting to anticipate showing \"Buddy,\" though, Justin said, and he really bonded with the animal.\n\nBoth Jessica and Justin advised kids new to raising livestock to spend plenty of time with the animals, so they will bond. That means spending some serious time with them.\n\n\"The hard work really does pay off in the end,\" Jessica noted.\n\nOne tip is to spend time frequently, not just all at once. For example, it is better to spend 10 minutes every day with an animal than to spend two hours all at once just once a week, she explained.\n\nJustin said to make sure that the essentials are taken care of by providing plenty of clean water and food, and making sure the animals' habitat is clean.\n\nHe stressed making sure animals get fresh water at least twice a day when it is really hot.\n\nLearning to raise animals through 4-H has some real benefits, Jessica said.\n\nIt has taught a lot about responsibility, and the determination to keep going, she said.\n\nDealing with the issues of animals teaches kids not to give up, Jessica said.\n\nAnother responsibility is keeping records of the animals, which is a benefit that can be used in the rest of life, Justin noted.\n\nRecord keeping teaches a person what they will need to know for a business, Jessica said.\n\nWhen 4-H kids are younger, it is mostly about having fun with the animals, but as they grow the stress is increasingly on the business side, she said.\n\nContact Times News Editor Dan Barker at business@fmtimes.com or follow twitter.com/DanBarkerFMTime", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.fortmorgantimes.com/fort-morgan-local-news/ci_26216393/veeman-kids-have-many-animals", "sailthru.author": "By Dan Barker \n \n  Times News Editor", "ag": {"canon": "FortMorganTimes:article:26216393:view"}, "startDate": "2014-08-02T01:00:00-0600", "twitter": {"domain": "fortmorgantimes.com", "description": "Justin, 13, and Jessica Veeman, 16, have plenty on their hands raising multiple animals for the Morgan County Fair this year.", "title": "Veeman kids have many animals", "url": "http://www.fortmorgantimes.com/fort-morgan-local-news/ci_26216393/veeman-kids-have-many-animals", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site32/2014/0725/20140725__30ftFairVeeman~1.jpg", "site": "@fortmorgantimes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Local News", "modificationDate": "2014-07-30T19:43:28-0600", "endDate": "2024-07-25T12:19:28-0600", "news_keywords": "Local News, Local News news, Fort Morgan Colorado Local News news, Fort Morgan Colorado news, Local News Fort Morgan news, Local News Colorado news, US Local News news, world Local News news.", "byline": "By Dan BarkerTimes", "pubDate": "2014-07-25T12:19:15-0600", "sailthru.date": "2014-08-02T01:00:00-0600", "sailthru.title": "Veeman kids have many animals", "verify-v1": "LR4Od6pVdw+l77OvOjnTMA990zoSdsdx5+1eNeWXVCw=", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site32/2014/0725/20140725__30ftFairVeeman~2_300.jpg", "description": "Justin, 13, and Jessica Veeman, 16, have plenty on their hands raising multiple animals for the Morgan County Fair this year.", "sailthru.site": "fortmorgantimes.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"url": "http://www.fortmorgantimes.com/fort-morgan-local-news/ci_26216393/veeman-kids-have-many-animals", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site32/2014/0725/20140725__30ftFairVeeman~1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Justin, 13, and Jessica Veeman, 16, have plenty on their hands raising multiple animals for the Morgan County Fair this year.", "title": "Veeman kids have many animals"}, "google-site-verification": "eft02te25vH0XbQ44RHik-QVdSWBMa6FaMX67tqgeec", "y_key": "87220ae8e8f6d27d", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site32/2014/0725/20140725__30ftFairVeeman~2.jpg"}, "article_summary": "Jessica Veeman takes her lamb for a walk at her home near the Veeman Dairy.\n(Dan Barker / Fort Morgan Times)Justin, 13, and Jessica Veeman, 16, have plenty on their hands raising multiple animals for the Morgan County Fair this year.\nBoth Jessica and Justin advised kids new to raising livestock to spend plenty of time with the animals, so they will bond.\nTips for raising stockJustin, 13, left, and Jessica Veeman, 16, both of Wiggins will show their steers at the Morgan County Fair this year.\nDealing with the issues of animals teaches kids not to give up, Jessica said."}
