Consider this piece my version of that, and let me put what I do understand about it in a nutshell: based on developments in our post-9/11 world, we could be watching the birth of a new American political system and way of governing for which, as yet, we have no name.\n\nAnd here\u2019s what I find strange: the evidence of this, however inchoate, is all around us and yet it\u2019s as if we can\u2019t bear to take it in or make sense of it or even say that it might be so.\n\nLet me make my case, however minimally, based on five areas in which at least the faint outlines of that new system seem to be emerging: political campaigns and elections; the privatization of Washington through the marriage of the corporation and the state; the de-legitimization of our traditional system of governance; the empowerment of the national security state as an untouchable fourth branch of government; and the demobilization of \u201cwe the people.\u201d\n\nWhatever this may add up to, it seems to be based, at least in part, on the increasing concentration of wealth and power in a new plutocratic class and in that ever-expanding national security state. Certainly, something out of the ordinary is underway, and yet its birth pangs, while widely reported, are generally categorized as aspects of an exceedingly familiar American system somewhat in disarray.\n\n1. 1% Elections\n\nCheck out the news about the 2016 presidential election and you\u2019ll quickly feel a sense of been-there, done-that. As a start, the two names most associated with it, Bush and Clinton, couldn\u2019t be more familiar, highlighting as they do the curiously dynastic quality of recent presidential contests. (If a Bush or Clinton should win in 2016 and again in 2020, a member of one of those families will have controlled the presidency for 28 of the last 36 years.)\n\nTake, for instance, \u201cWhy 2016 Is Likely to Become a Close Race,\u201d a recent piece Nate Cohn wrote for my hometown paper. A noted election statistician, Cohn points out that, despite Hillary Clinton\u2019s historically staggering lead in Democratic primary polls (and lack of serious challengers), she could lose the general election. He bases this on what we know about her polling popularity from the Monica Lewinsky moment of the 1990s to the present. Cohn assures readers that Hillary will not \u201cbe a Democratic Eisenhower, a popular, senior statesperson who cruises to an easy victory.\u201d It\u2019s the sort of comparison that offers a certain implicit reassurance about the near future. (No, Virginia, we haven\u2019t left the world of politics in which former general and president Dwight D. Eisenhower can still be a touchstone.)\n\nCohn may be right when it comes to Hillary\u2019s electability, but this is not Dwight D. Eisenhower\u2019s or even Al Gore\u2019s America. If you want a measure of that, consider this year\u2019s primaries. I mean, of course, the 2015 ones. Once upon a time, the campaign season started with candidates flocking to Iowa and New Hampshire early in the election year to establish their bona fides among party voters. These days, however, those are already late primaries.\n\nThe early primaries, the ones that count, take place among a small group of millionaires andbillionaires, a new caste flush with cash who will personally, or through complex networks of funders, pour multi-millions of dollars into the campaigns of candidates of their choice. So the early primaries \u2014 this year mainly a Republican affair \u2014 are taking place in resort spots like Las Vegas, Rancho Mirage, California, and Sea Island, Georgia, as has been widely reported. These \u201ccontests\u201d involve groveling politicians appearing at the beck and call of the rich and powerful, and so reflect our new 1% electoral system. (The main pro-Hillary super PAC, for instance, is aiming for a kitty of $500 million heading into 2016, while the Koch brothers network has already promised to drop almost $1 billion into the coming campaign season, doubling their efforts in the last presidential election year.)\n\nEver since the Supreme Court opened up the ultimate floodgates with its 2010 Citizens United decision, each subsequent election has seen record-breaking amounts of money donated and spent. The 2012 presidential campaign was the first $2 billion election; campaign 2016 is expected to hit the $5 billion mark without breaking a sweat. By comparison, according to Burton Abrams and Russell Settle in their study, \u201cThe Effect of Broadcasting on Political Campaign Spending,\u201d Republicans and Democrats spent just under $13 million combined in 1956 when Eisenhower won his second term.\n\nIn the meantime, it\u2019s still true that the 2016 primaries will involve actual voters, as will the election that follows. The previous election season, the midterms of 2014, cost almost $4 billion, a record despite the number of small donors continuing to drop. It also represented the lowest midterm voter turnout since World War II. (See: demobilization of the public, below \u2014 and add in the demobilization of the Democrats as a real party, the breaking of organized labor, the fragmenting of the Republican Party, and the return of voter suppression laws visibly meant to limit the franchise.) It hardly matters just what the flood of new money does in such elections, when you can feel the weight of inequality bearing down on the whole process in a way that is pushing us somewhere new.\n\n2. The Privatization of the State (or the U.S. as a Prospective Third-World Nation)\n\nIn the recent coverage of the Hillary Clinton email flap, you can find endless references to the Clintons of yore in wink-wink, you-know-how-they-are-style reporting; and yes, she did delete a lot of emails; and yes, it\u2019s an election year coming and, as everyone points out, the Republicans are going to do their best to keep the email issue alive until hell freezes over, etc., etc. Again, the coverage, while eyeball gluing, is in a you\u2019ve-seen-it-all-before, you\u2019ll-see-it-all-again-mode.\n\nHowever, you haven\u2019t seen it all before. The most striking aspect of this little brouhaha lies in what\u2019s most obvious but least highlighted. An American secretary of state chose to set up her own private, safeguarded email system for doing government work; that is, she chose to privatize her communications. If this were Cairo, it might not warrant a second thought. But it didn\u2019t happen in some third-world state. It was the act of a key official of the planet\u2019s reigning (or thrashing) superpower, which \u2014 even if it wasn\u2019t the first time such a thing had ever occurred \u2014 should be taken as a tiny symptom of something that couldn\u2019t be larger or, in the long stretch of history, newer: the ongoing privatization of the American state, or at least the national security part of it.\n\nThough the marriage of the state and the corporation has a pre-history, the full-scale arrival of the warrior corporation only occurred after 9/11. Someday, that will undoubtedly be seen as a seminal moment in the formation of whatever may be coming in this country. Only 13 years later, there is no part of the war state that has not experienced major forms of privatization. The U.S. military could no longer go to war without its crony corporationsdoing KP and guard duty, delivering the mail, building the bases, and being involved in just about all of its activities, including training the militaries of foreign allies and even fighting. Such warrior corporations are now involved in every aspect of the national security state, including torture, drone strikes, and \u2014 to the tune of hundreds of thousands of contract employees like Edward Snowden \u2014 intelligence gathering and spying. You name it and, in these years, it\u2019s been at least partly privatized.\n\nAll you have to do is read reporter James Risen\u2019s recent book, Pay Any Price, on how the global war on terror was fought in Washington, and you know that privatization has brought something else with it: corruption, scams, and the gaming of the system for profits of a sort that might normally be associated with a typical third-world kleptocracy. And all of this, a new world being born, was reflected in a tiny way in Hillary Clinton\u2019s very personal decision about her emails.\n\nThough it\u2019s a subject I know so much less about, this kind of privatization (and the corruption that goes with it) is undoubtedly underway in the non-war-making, non-security-projecting part of the American state as well.\n\n3. The De-legitimization of Congress and the Presidency\n\n\n\nOn a third front, American \u201cconfidence\u201d in the three classic check-and-balance branches of government, as measured by polling outfits, continues to fall. In 2014, Americans expressing a \u201cgreat deal of confidence\u201d in the Supreme Court hit a new low of 23%; in the presidency, it was 11%, and in Congress a bottom-scraping 5%. (The military, on the other hand, registers at 50%.) The figures for \u201chardly any confidence at all\u201d are respectively 20%, 44%, and more than 50%. All are in or near record-breaking territory for the last four decades.\n\nIt seems fair to say that in recent years Congress has been engaged in a process of delegitimizing itself. Where that body once had the genuine power to declare war, for example, it is now \u201cdebating\u201d in a desultory fashion an \u201cauthorization\u201d for a war against the Islamic State in Syria, Iraq, and possibly elsewhere that has already been underway for eight months and whose course, it seems, will be essentially unaltered, whether Congress authorizes it or not.\n\nWhat would President Harry Truman, who once famously ran a presidential campaign against a \u201cdo-nothing\u201d Congress, have to say about a body that truly can do just about nothing? Or rather, to give the Republican war hawks in that new Congress their due, not quite nothing. They are proving capable of acting effectively to delegitimize the presidency as well. House Majority Leader John Boehner\u2019s invitation to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to undercut the president\u2019s Iranian nuclear negotiations and the lettersigned by 47 Republican senators and directed to the Iranian ayatollahs are striking examples of this. They are visibly meant to tear down an \u201cimperial presidency\u201d that Republicans gloried in not so long ago.", "article_metadata": {"description": "One-percent elections.
