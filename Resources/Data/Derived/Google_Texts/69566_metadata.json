In 2011, the latest year Oklahoma deer crash statistics are available, there were 467 crashes involving deer. Two people died and 184 people were injured.\n\n\u201cMore or less, I got lucky, just cuts, scrapes, bruises and nightmares,\u201d Gransberg said.\n\nGransberg said it could have been worse, considering he was supposed to have a partner riding with him that day in the front seat.\n\nLuckily, those plans changed.\n\nAccording to State Farm, there is a 7.5 percent higher chance Oklahoma drivers will hit a deer in the next 12 months than in 2014, possibly due to more deer because of a milder, wetter year.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "The chances of Oklahoma drivers colliding with a deer go up from this time until the end of the year.", "author": "Lacie Lowry", "og": {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/30653841/oklahoma-law-enforcement-officer-recalls-extreme-deer-vs-car-collision", "image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/9377763_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The chances of Oklahoma drivers colliding with a deer go up from this time until the end of the year.", "title": "Oklahoma Law Enforcement Officer Recalls Extreme Deer Vs.
