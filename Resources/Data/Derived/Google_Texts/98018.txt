Healing America

Guardian verdict: The implication then was that these challenges, though time-consuming, would eventually be met during his presidency. Instead, in previewing his final State of the Union in 2016, Obama acknowledged much remains: “I want to focus on … what we all need to do together in the years to come: the big things … that’s what’s on my mind”.

Healing Washington

Guardian verdict: It is easy to forget that Obama campaigned as a unifier; someone who would heal partisan differences. People will argue over which party is to blame, but few would dispute he has failed in this.

Gay rights

Guardian verdict: It took longer than hoped for to arrive, but Obama has now presided over one of the longest periods of uninterrupted job growth – 56 months – in US history; it is wages that have failed to keep up – a sore point that rather undermines his wider economic achievements.
