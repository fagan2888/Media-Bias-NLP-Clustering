Against the struggling Cowboys (1-9, 1-4), Stevens was only 11-for-15 for 120 yards, and the offensive story was the ground game, with running backs Dalyn Dawkins (140 yards on 25 carries) and Izzy Matthews (55 yards in 16 carries) benefitting from the work of the banged-up CSU offensive line up front.\n\nOn defense, the Rams limited Wyoming\u2019s Brian Hill, who came in averaging 6.2 yards per carry, to 65 yards on 21 carries.\n\n\u201cThe defense played outstanding,\u201d said CSU coach Mike Bobo. \u201cThey did a great job of setting the edges and gang-tackling Mr. Hill.\u201d\n\nThe Rams scored on their first four possessions, on Matthews runs of 2 and 9 yards, a 33-yard Wyatt Bryan field goal and a 1-yard Stevens sneak, taking a 23-0 lead midway through the second quarter. The Rams added Bryan\u2019s 31-yarder with 26 seconds left in the third and then, with CSU\u2019s second defense in, Wyoming avoided the shutout on Hill\u2019s 4-yard run with 2:25 remaining. It would have been CSU\u2019s first shutout since 1997.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always great when you\u2019re able to get the running game going, because if you do need to come out and throw it, you can,\u201d said Stevens. \u201cWe still threw a little bit and did OK in the passing game, but I think we\u2019re all satisfied with the running game.\u201d\n\nCSU\u2019s leading ground gainer, injured senior Jasen Oden Jr., didn\u2019t suit up and watched from the sideline against the Cowboys, and Matthews, a true freshman from Redding, Calif., and Dawkins, a sophomore transfer from Purdue, shared the running back duties.\n\n\u201cJasen had an injury from the last game (a 41-17 loss to San Diego State) and we tried to get him ready,\u201d Bobo said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to talk specifics of the injury. He practiced a little bit Thursday, but he was just a no-go from the trainers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been saying it all year, Dalyn Dawkins is the toughest football player on this team. He runs like it. This is probably the first time he\u2019s been healthy since \u2026 Colorado, when he had a little hamstring.\u201d Bobo added, \u201cHe\u2019s got his confidence back, and he\u2019s one tough individual. I told him yesterday, \u2018Be ready for 30 carries.\u2019 How many did he up with, 25 carries, and he responded and did a nice job.\u201d\n\nSaid Dawkins: \u201cJust about every play, there was at least one crease I could hit, and that\u2019s all I ask for. Credit to the O-line.\u201d\n\nDawkins, the nephew of former Broncos safety Brain Dawkins, conceded, \u201cThe hamstring kind of held me back throughout the year.\u201d\n\nHe also has lost a couple of fumbles this season, tempering Bobo\u2019s enthusiasm for the work of the diminutive runner. Dawkins held on to the ball Saturday, and CSU\u2019s only turnover was Andrew Wingard\u2019s end zone interception of Stevens late in the first half.\n\n\u201cAll my life, that\u2019s never been a real big issue with me,\u201d Dawkins said. \u201cI think that stuff happened because I got hurt. That was just some added stress.\u201d\n\nCenter Jake Bennett said of the offensive line play: \u201cI think it was just scheme, we had a good scheme going that got us in the right spots and we were able to get some pretty good creases out there. \u2026 This is definitely a good momentum swing. We\u2019ve been grinding and haven\u2019t been getting results, so this is definitely a good feeling.\u201d\n\nLinebacker Kevin Davis, the junior and former high school hockey star from Fountain, was the Rams\u2019 leading tackler with eight total, six solo and two unassisted.\n\n\u201cIt was awesome to beat Wyoming at Wyoming and be able to keep the boot another year,\u201d Davis said. \u201cWe played downhill and aggressive, we played assignment football and we played as a family on defense. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve been harping on all week.\u201d\n\nCSU now needs to win two of its last three \u2014 against UNLV, New Mexico and Fresno State \u2014 to become bowl-eligible in Bobo\u2019s first season.\n\nThe Rams\u2019 win came in what had to be among the most ideal football weather conditions ever in November in Laramie. The skies were cloudless, winds negligible and temperatures in the 40s. Other than that, it was another ugly day for the Cowboys, who have beaten only Nevada in their second season under former North Dakota State coach Craig Bohl.\n\nTerry Frei: tfrei@denverpost.com or @TFrei\n\nGame balls\n\nDalyn Dawkins, RB, CSU:\n\nRushed for 140 yards on 25 carries.\n\nJake Bennett, C, CSU:\n\nAs the anchor, represents the Rams line that dominated up front.\n\nTrent Matthews, S, CSU:\n\nHad two fumble recoveries and an interception.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Bronze Boot remains CSU\u2019s after Rams\u2019 26-7 win over Wyoming", "title": "Bronze Boot remains CSU\u2019s after Rams\u2019 26-7 win over Wyoming", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/11/07/bronze-boot-remains-csus-after-rams-26-7-win-over-wyoming/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151107_043940_csu-wyoming-football.jpg", "height": 422}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151107_043940_csu-wyoming-football.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-07T16:20:18+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-20T02:57:17+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Colorado State University"}, "article_summary": "\u201cIt was awesome to beat Wyoming at Wyoming and be able to keep the boot another year,\u201d Davis said.\nOn defense, the Rams limited Wyoming\u2019s Brian Hill, who came in averaging 6.2 yards per carry, to 65 yards on 21 carries.\n\u201cIt\u2019s always great when you\u2019re able to get the running game going, because if you do need to come out and throw it, you can,\u201d said Stevens.\nThe Rams\u2019 win came in what had to be among the most ideal football weather conditions ever in November in Laramie.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big ol\u2019 boot.\u201dYes, Stevens was holding the Bronze Boot, the traveling trophy reward for the Rams\u2019 surprisingly easy \u2014 easier than the score would hint \u2014 26-7 win over Wyoming in the Border War at War Memorial Stadium."}
