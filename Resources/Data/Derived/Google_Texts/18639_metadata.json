That\u2019s where he met his wife, Roseann. After serving four years in the Navy, the Philadelphia native completed medical school at the University of Pennsylvania, and then internal medicine training at the University of Wisconsin.\n\nBentley began practicing medicine at St. John\u2019s, now Mercy Hospital Springfield, in the late 1960s. And he served there for 35 years, including a role as chief of staff.\n\n\u201cIn the beginning of course I was in a private clinic, it was known as the Glen Turner Clinic of Internal Medicine with offices in the Professional Building. We all owned our own practices then,\u201d Bentley said.\n\nThe medical practice began to change in the 1980s, Bentley said, as big hospitals began to buy practices. As he puts it, medicine became more of a corporation effort, rather than a private enterprise effort. It\u2019s one of the reasons he became involved in volunteer work.\n\n\u201cDuring that time then I got interested in the Kitchen Clinic and served as medical director of the Kitchen Clinic for probably 10-15 years, and then we started the Jordan Valley Community Health Center.\u201d\n\nIt was at the clinic that Bentley met Sister Lorraine, founder of the Missouri Hotel, who Bentley calls his mentor and heroine.\n\nThe patient capacity was sparse, at first, serving only 5-10 each day. Bentley said he and Lorraine realized they had to expand to really serve the underserved.\n\n\u201cThe opportunity then came along to apply for a grant from the federal government to get some startup money to start was is still known as the community healthcare center.\u201d\n\nWhen Jordan Valley Community Health Center was founded in 2002, Bentley said he wasn\u2019t sure how large the operation would become.\n\n\u201cWe started with seven employees in a littler storefront clinic out on East Division Street. We now have over 300 and some employees and we\u2019re in the great big building downtown by the viaduct. No, we had no idea we were gonna do this.\u201d\n\nJordan Valley treats uninsured patients, those with Medicaid and individuals with regular insurance. Bentley calls this 3-teired model by community health centers \u201cthe future of reimbursement in medicine.\u201d\n\nBentley supports the Affordable Care Act, and challenges the law\u2019s critics to visit the clinic to see how \u201cintegrated medicine at a reasonable cost is a good thing.\u201d\n\nHe acknowledges that tweaks to the law are needed.\n\nBentley said, \u201cI think there has to be a better definition of who can acquire the insurance. There has to be some better payment technique for the insurance, and medicine itself has to learn how to take care of people without spending four or five times as much as they need to to take care of something that\u2019s minor.\u201d\n\nHe said it\u2019s a common practice at Jordan Valley to ask the patients up front if they can afford a certain procedure or type of medicine.\n\nDr. John Bentley was honored as the 2015 Springfieldian by the Springfield Area Chamber of Commerce on January 30. He\u2019s no stranger to accomplishments, however.\n\nThe Chamber says Bentley is one of only a handful of individuals to be recognized with the Humanitarian Award, Missourian Award and the Springfieldian Award, which he received in 2002, 2010, and 2015, respectively. He also earned the Springfield Area Chamber of Commerce Salute to Healthcare Award in 1999, the Gift of Time Volunteer of the Year Award in 2000, and the Citizenship and Community Service Award in 2003 from the Missouri State Medical Association.\n\nView the video naming Dr. Bentley the 2015 Springfieldian.\n\nSpringfieldian of the Year 2015 Main Vid-HD from Springfield Chamber of Commerce on Vimeo.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health", "description": "It\u2019s safe to say that Dr. John Bentley has found a home in Springfield and a place in the area\u2019s medical history archives.
