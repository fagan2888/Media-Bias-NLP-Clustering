Early this month it rolled out a \u201cmultimillion dollar ad effort\u201d targeting Senators Kay Hagan (D-N.C.), Mary Landrieu (D-L.A.) and Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.). Two ads released Tuesday exposed Michigan Rep.Gary Peters and Iowa Rep. Bruce Braley.\n\nNo more than 30-odd seconds are needed for AFP to pack the punch:\n\nAFP President Tim Phillips is open about the intent \u2014 a full Obamacare repeal:\n\nWe\u2019re putting pressure on senators who repeated [Obama's] lie and doubled down on ObamaCare even as it became obvious that the law was hurting millions of Americans. The story of ObamaCare is one of less choice, rising premiums, and broken promises. AFP is committed to a long-term effort to stop this law.\n\nThe heat placed on Democrat lawmakers could also help the Republicans poised to pick up an additional six seats and take control of the Senate this year. The New York Times noted Wednesday:\n\nCampaign experts said they believe that the early advertising blitz has driven down the support for Senate incumbents in highly competitive states such as Louisiana and North Carolina that are critical to the Democratic Party\u2019s push to hold its majority. Some House Democrats in competitive districts find themselves under steady assault with little ability to respond unless they want to dip into money they will need later in the campaign.\n\nMoney isn't the only thing these lawmakers need to get them out of hot water. While the AFP may indeed have the funding of the billionaire Koch brothers, they also have the truth. Obamacare is a failing piece of legislation \u2014 poorly planned, executed and riddled with disastrous effects. Leaders backing the legislation should be held accountable.\n\nThe New York Times provided this helpful graphic of the lawmakers AFP brought to national attention:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Lawmakers who supported Obamacare and spread the president\u2019s ?false statement \u201cif you like your health care plan you can keep your health care plan,\u201d are taking the heat from recent ads launched by Americans For Prosperity. .05/24/2016 3:07:28AM EST.", "author": "Sarah Jean Seman", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Lawmakers who supported Obamacare and spread the president\u2019s ?false statement \u201cif you like your health care plan you can keep your health care plan,\u201d are taking the heat from recent ads launched by Americans For Prosperity.", "title": "Sarah Jean Seman - Money and Truth: AFP Unloads Anti-Obamacare Ads", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/sarahjeanseman/2014/01/15/money-and-truth-afp-unloads-antiobamacare-ads-n1779464", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2014/1/15/7.png", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Lawmakers who supported Obamacare and spread the president\u2019s ?false statement \u201cif you like your health care plan you can keep your health care plan,\u201d are taking the heat from recent ads launched by Americans For Prosperity.", "title": "Sarah Jean Seman - Money and Truth: AFP Unloads Anti-Obamacare Ads", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/sarahjeanseman/2014/01/15/money-and-truth-afp-unloads-antiobamacare-ads-n1779464", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2014/1/15/7.png", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Money and Truth: AFP Unloads Anti-Obamacare Ads , Sarah Jean Seman, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd950e\"", "article_summary": "The New York Times provided this helpful graphic of the lawmakers AFP brought to national attention:\nMoney isn't the only thing these lawmakers need to get them out of hot water.\nWhile the AFP may indeed have the funding of the billionaire Koch brothers, they also have the truth.\nEarly this month it rolled out a \u201cmultimillion dollar ad effort\u201d targeting Senators Kay Hagan (D-N.C.), Mary Landrieu (D-L.A.) and Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.).\nTwo ads released Tuesday exposed Michigan Rep.Gary Peters and Iowa Rep.
