These are the key findings of a new PPIC report, Expanding Health Coverage in California: County Jails as Enrollment Sites.\n\nCoauthor Shannon McConville presented the report to a Sacramento audience last week. She noted that the 4 million state residents who are still uninsured will probably be the toughest to reach. The legislature has allocated money to target these Californians and increase enrollment in health coverage under the Affordable Care Act (ACA).\n\nAt the same time, counties\u2014which have gained new responsibilities for low-level criminal offenders\u2014have new incentives to help inmates successfully transition back into the community and avoid further contact with the criminal justice system.\n\n\u201cHealth coverage, newly available under the ACA, could be part of a more comprehensive reentry strategy,\u201d McConville said.\n\nManaged care plans are also increasingly focused on better integrating physical health and behavioral health, providing more mental health and substance abuse treatment\u2014services needed by the jail population.\n\nThese policy changes add up to an opportunity to leverage federal and state Medi-Cal resources to improve both public health and safety. Enrolling inmates could improve health care in the jail system, lower county corrections costs, and reduce recidivism.\n\nMcConville said the work to achieve these goals is just beginning. Counties are still adjusting to their new responsibilities. As a first step, they will need to identify effective enrollment strategies that improve reentry and reduce recidivism.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"app_id": 1374972679394361}, "description": "Originally posted at the Public Policy Institute of CA.
