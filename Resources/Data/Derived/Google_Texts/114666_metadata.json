Richard Pan (D-Sacramento) talks to reporters after the Senate approved a bill he co-authored. It would require virtually all children to be vaccinated. ( Pauline Bartolone/Capital Public Radio )\n\nThe state Senate has passed a bill that would require virtually all California schoolchildren to be vaccinated.\n\nSB277 would end the \u201cpersonal belief exemption\u201d that allows parents to opt out of vaccines on behalf of their children and send their kids to school with some vaccinations or none at all. The Senate voted 25-10, mostly on partisan lines, after a long debate Thursday morning.\n\nThe bill\u2019s co-author, Sen. Richard Pan (D-Sacramento), introduced the bill in the wake of a measles outbreak earlier this year that started at Disneyland.\n\nWhile statewide vaccination rates are high \u2014 over 90 percent \u2014 some communities have high rates of children with a personal belief exemption on file with their school districts. In some schools, the rate of personal belief exemptions can be 50 percent or much higher.\n\n\u201cWhen you have pockets of low vaccination,\u201d Pan said, \u201cwe need to do more to protect our communities. \u2026 This is a matter of public safety.\u201d\n\nSeveral sets of amendments to the bill \u2014 including a religious exemption and a requirement to disclose vaccine ingredients \u2014 were introduced and then tabled after votes by the full Senate.\n\n\u201cGetting a religious exemption is not unreasonable,\u201d said Sen. Joel Anderson, R-San Diego. \u201cDon\u2019t get caught up with zeal. \u2026 You can gain more with honey than you can with vinegar.\u201d\n\nBut Pan said that he had not received any letters from mainstream religious organizations opposing the bill. He and SB277 co-author Ben Allen (D-Santa Monica) have \u201chad our own conversations with religious leaders, including the Catholic Church, and they do not oppose vaccination or this bill,\u201d he said.\n\nA religious exemption could become an issue with Gov. Jerry Brown, who added a religious exemption in 2012 when he signed into law another Pan vaccine bill \u2014 AB2109, which required those wanting a personal belief exemption to first meet with a health care provider.\n\nPan said he was open to talking with the governor about a religious exemption, but said he had not heard from Brown\u2019s office.\n\nIf Pan\u2019s bill becomes law, California would become only the third state without both a religious and personal exemption to vaccines. It would mean that children not fully vaccinated against 10 specified diseases could only be home-schooled. The bill applies to all students in public, private and parochial schools.\n\nChildren who cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons would be able to obtain an exemption. This includes children being treated for cancer or those with a compromised immune system.\n\nThe bill heads next to the Assembly.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The bill would require virtually all California schoolchildren to be vaccinated against 10 diseases.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"California Senate Approves Bill That Would End Vaccine Opt-Out\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2015\\/05\\/14\\/california-senate-approves-bill-that-would-end-vaccine-opt-out\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-05-14 11:46:29\",\"mod_date\":\"2015-06-03 15:49:25\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":27292,\"author_id\":\"240\",\"author_name\":\"Lisa Aliferis\",\"author_display_name\":\"Lisa Aliferis\",\"tags\":[\"personal belief exemption\",\"Science\",\"Vaccine\",\"Vaccines\"],\"categories\":[\"Community Health\",\"Policy\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2015\\/05\\/Pan-e1431647084619.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "The bill would require virtually all California schoolchildren to be vaccinated against 10 diseases.", "title": "California Senate Approves Bill That Would End Vaccine Opt-Out", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2015/05/14/california-senate-approves-bill-that-would-end-vaccine-opt-out/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2015/05/Pan-1440x941.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "personal belief exemption,science,vaccine,vaccines", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc05d\"", "article_summary": "If Pan\u2019s bill becomes law, California would become only the third state without both a religious and personal exemption to vaccines.\n( Pauline Bartolone/Capital Public Radio )The state Senate has passed a bill that would require virtually all California schoolchildren to be vaccinated.\n\u201cWhen you have pockets of low vaccination,\u201d Pan said, \u201cwe need to do more to protect our communities.\nIn some schools, the rate of personal belief exemptions can be 50 percent or much higher.\n\u201cGetting a religious exemption is not unreasonable,\u201d said Sen.
