After the Redskins ran the ball three times, they went for it on fourth-and-2. McCoy faked the handoff, rolled to the right and dumped an easy pass to Crowder, who caught it for a 10-yard gain to finish with five catches for 109 yards. Running back Pierre Thomas ran the ball three more times to pick up another first down to set up the victory formation.\n\n\u201cI tried to give him a nice easy one he wouldn\u2019t drop,\u201d said McCoy, who replaced starter Kirk Cousins second quarter. \u201cI knew there was a chance I\u2019d come in and play this game, so I talked to Jamison \u2026 just do what you do I\u2019m going to get warmed up and we\u2019ll figure this thing out.\u201d\n\nCrowder finished the regular season with 59 catches, 604 yards and two touchdowns. His receptions are the most by a rookie in team history, passing Art Monk, who had 58 in 1980. It is also the second-most by a member of the Redskins in his first NFL season: Gary Clark, who played two seasons in the USFL, had 72 receptions in 1985.\n\nOn the Redskins\u2018 second drive of the game, Crowder took a screen pass 44 yards on the first play to the Cowboys\u2018 five-yard line. Washington scored on the next play, when Cousins connected with Ryan Grant. On the ensuing possession, Crowder scored on a three-yard reception.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been outstanding,\u201d McCoy said. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to cover him man-to-man. The good thing about our offense is he\u2019s created such a dynamic for us because who do you play one-on-one? When they take away other guys, Jamison always wins.\u201d\n\nRobinson returns to defensive role\n\nThe Redskins\u2018 starters began to trickle out of the game during the third quarter, including inside linebacker Will Compton, which presented Keenan Robinson the opportunity to gauge the strength of his injured right shoulder.\n\nRobinson played throughout the second half, marking the most snaps he has seen since returning from the injury four games ago. He had played a combined 13 snaps on defense in the last two games and said it felt good to be back out there for an extended period on Sunday. Robinson had missed four games before returning against the Chicago Bears on Dec. 13.\n\n\u201cI was surprised to see where I was at,\u201d Robinson said. \u201cIt\u2019s like being away for a long time, having to get back into the groove of things. It was different being back out there, but overall, I thought I did good when I was out there.\u201d\n\nWith Perry Riley also out with a foot injury, Compton and Mason Foster have since secured starting roles. However, having Robinson, and possibly Riley, both healthy for the playoffs should help boost the depth at the position.\n\n\u201cWe get Perry Riley hopefully back next week and we\u2019ll make a decision then, but we feel good about all those linebackers,\u201d Gruden said.\n\nPhillips, Jarrett exit with injuries\n\nCornerback Dashaun Phillips sustained a cervical stinger and was carted off the field during the second quarter. According to a team spokesman, Phillips was transported to a local hospital, but was able to move his extremities.\n\nPhillips, who was injured when he collided head-first with Cowboys running back Darren McFadden, underwent testing at the hospital and his results were negative, according to Gruden.\n\n\u201c\u2018His test came back OK, so that\u2019s good news on him,\u201d Gruden said.\n\nDefensive back Kyshoen Jarrett was injured in the first quarter on a similar play when he also collided with McFadden. He was being evaluated for a concussion during the game and underwent an MRI examination on his neck once it was over.\n\nRedskins take chance to rest starters\n\nThe Redskins also used Sunday\u2019s game to rest some of the starters, as left tackle Trent Williams and defensive end Jason Hatcher were both inactive. The other inactives were Riley (foot), free safety Dashon Goldson (broken rib/shoulder), cornerback Quinton Dunbar (quad), running back Matt Jones (hip) and quarterback Robert Griffin III. \u2026 Washington set records with a 69.5 team completion percentage, surpassing the mark of 66.5 percent set last year. Its 386 completions were also a team record. \u2026 Wide receiver Pierre Garcon\u2019s 39-yard touchdown reception in the first quarter was his sixth of the season, tying a career high set while playing for the Indianapolis Colts in 2010 and 2011. \u2026 Wide receiver Rashad Ross caught the first touchdown pass of his career in the fourth quarter on a 71-yard completion from McCoy. \u2026 Compton\u2019s interception of Cowboys quarterback Kellen Moore in the first quarter was the first of his career. \u2026 Nose tackle Chris Baker finished the regular season with a career-high six sacks and tied him with Stephen Bowen in 2011 for the most by a defensive lineman since the team adopted a 3-4 defensive scheme in 2010.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Crowder finished with five catches for 109 yards and a touchdown in the Redskins' 34-23 victory, putting the cap on a season in which he had the most receptions by a rookie in team history.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Crowder finished with five catches for 109 yards and a touchdown in the Redskins\u2019 34-23 victory, putting the cap on a season in which he had the most receptions by a rookie in team history.", "title": "Jamison Crowder finishes productive rookie season in Redskins\u2019 win at Cowboys", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/jan/3/jamison-crowder-productive-rookie-redskins/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/01/03/AP_224804519352.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/01/03/AP_224804519352.jpg", "description": "Crowder finished with five catches for 109 yards and a touchdown in the Redskins' 34-23 victory, putting the cap on a season in which he had the most receptions by a rookie in team history.", "card": "summary", "title": "Jamison Crowder finishes productive rookie season in Redskins\u2019 w"}, "Author": "Anthony Gulizia", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Dallas Cowboys, Washington Redskins, Colt Mccoy"}, "article_summary": "On the Redskins\u2018 second drive of the game, Crowder took a screen pass 44 yards on the first play to the Cowboys\u2018 five-yard line.\nARLINGTON, Texas \u2014 Jamison Crowder normally doesn\u2019t pay attention to his stats during a game, but this time they were hard to miss.\nCrowder had four catches for 99 yards \u2014 so close to breaking the 100-yard mark for the first time in his career.\nHis receptions are the most by a rookie in team history, passing Art Monk, who had 58 in 1980.\n\u2026 Compton\u2019s interception of Cowboys quarterback Kellen Moore in the first quarter was the first of his career."}
