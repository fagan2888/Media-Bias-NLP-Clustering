Senator Ted Cruz is called a lot of things: Smart and explosive, to name a few. CNBC's John Harwood sits down with the polarizing Ivy League Republican in Houston, Texas.

Avocado makes Sen. Ted Cruz sick.

The Texas Republican liked playing a bad guy in high school theater, hearing audiences cheer when he got killed.



He passed on thoughts of both military service and a Hollywood acting career; now he says he regrets the former but not the latter.

And he won't say whether fellow Texan Lyndon B. Johnson was right in creating Medicare or his political hero Ronald Reagan was right in his vain attempt to stop it.

That's some of what emerged from a wide-ranging interview with the hard-right candidate for president, who for much of the country remains a two-dimensional figure who read Dr. Seuss on the Senate floor during extended remarks aimed at stopping Obamacare. The effort failed and left fellow Republicans angry at Cruz as a subsequent government shutdown backfired politically.

Cruz explained he was merely keeping faith with the Texans who sent him to Washington, and blamed the media for distorting his public image.

"Historically the media's had two caricatures for Republicansâ€”that we are either stupid or evil," he explained over a Tex-Mex lunch in Houston. "They've to some extent invented a third caricature for me, which is crazy. I get portrayed in a lot of outlets as a wild-eyed lunatic with dynamite around my chest."

"You know, at the end of the day, that doesn't bother me because it's fundamentally false," he concluded. "I've got real confidence that the American people make their own judgment."
