Burkholder had six points and two steals in that stretch.\n\nGonzaga didn\u2019t score for almost five minutes as James Madison took the lead.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t even really know what happened,\u201d Gonzaga\u2019s Sunny Greinacher said of that stretch. \u201cThey were so strong in that period of time. They really got us on our heels.\u201d\n\nThe Bulldogs cut the lead to six points with 1:39 left, but Burkholder made a pair of free throws to extend the lead and James Madison held on for the win.\n\nGonzaga (29-5) was led by Greinacher, who had 17 points and Haiden Palmer added 14.\n\nIt was James Madison\u2019s first trip to the tournament since 2011 and the sixth straight for Gonzaga, which had the highest seed in school history. Now the Dukes will have to beat host Texas A&M; to make it to the Sweet 16.\n\nBurkholder led the league with 106 3-pointers. But she had a tough time shooting on Sunday, going 4 for 17. But she didn\u2019t have any problems with her free throws and 17 of 18.\n\nWhen she capped James Madison\u2019s big run with a 3-pointer, the band went wild and held up a sign reading \u201cYou got Kirby\u2018d,\u201d their signature chant when she hits a 3.\n\n\u201cTaking over the game in a variety ways - that\u2019s what she does,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cThat\u2019s the way we recruited her. We didn\u2019t recruit her as a shooter. We recruited her as a basketball player and we made her into a shooter. So when things aren\u2019t going well for her from the 3-point line she resorts back to her old ways of being just a basketball player and that\u2019s what you saw tonight.\u201d\n\nToia Giggetts added 15 points and Precious Hall had 11 points for James Madison.\n\n\u201cWe got the shots we wanted,\u201d Gonzaga coach Kelly Graves said. \u201cWe just didn\u2019t make them. The bottom line is you\u2019ve got to make baskets.\u201d\n\nGonzaga used a 6-0 run to take a 48-44 lead with about nine minutes left. That run was started by a 3-point play by Palmer where she made an off-balanced shot before crashing to the court.\n\nBurkholder pushed James Madison\u2019s lead to five points with three free throws to start the second half before Gonzaga scored five straight points to tie it at 36-all with about 18 minutes left.\n\nSunny Greinacher\u2019s second 3-point play of the half put Gonzaga up 39-38 - its first lead since early in the first half - with just under 15 minutes remaining.\n\nJames Madison trailed by 3 early in the first half before using a 13-4 run to take a 17-11 lead about 12 minutes before halftime. James Madison got points from five different players during that stretch and Gonzaga missed four 3-pointers as they fell behind.\n\nLindsay Sherbert finally ended Gonzaga\u2019s 3-point drought when she made one a few seconds later before the team added a free throw to cut the lead to 2 points.\n\nJames Madison started another run after that, outscoring Gonzaga 10-4 over the next 4 1/2 minutes to extend the lead to 27-19.\n\nThe Dukes didn\u2019t have a turnover until a shot clock violation with 4:33 remaining in the first half. The next time they had the ball, they missed three shots but grabbed the rebound after each miss before Lauren Okafor finally finished the possession with a layup that made it 31-23.\n\nGonzaga used an 8-2 run, with six points from Palmer, to close out the first half and cut the lead to 33-31 at halftime.", "article_metadata": {"description": "James Madison coach Kenny Brooks was enjoying breakfast on Sunday morning when he got a text from the team's trainer that put an immediate damper on his big day.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "James Madison coach Kenny Brooks was enjoying breakfast on Sunday morning when he got a text from the team\u2019s trainer that put an immediate damper on his big day.", "title": "Burkholder leads James Madison over Gonzaga 72-63", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/mar/23/burkholder-leads-james-madison-over-gonzaga-72-63/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/03/23/6c6211bf90d54e0b4f0f6a7067005290.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/03/23/6c6211bf90d54e0b4f0f6a7067005290.jpg", "description": "James Madison coach Kenny Brooks was enjoying breakfast on Sunday morning when he got a text from the team's trainer that put an immediate damper on his big day.", "card": "summary", "title": "Burkholder leads James Madison over Gonzaga 72-63"}, "Author": "KRISTIE RIEKEN", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Kirby Burkholder, James Madison, Gonzaga, Kenny Brooks"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd143b\"", "article_summary": "11 seed James Madison to a 72-63 win over sixth-seed Gonzaga the first round of the NCAA tournament for its first tournament win since 1991.\nGonzaga didn\u2019t score for almost five minutes as James Madison took the lead.\nJames Madison got points from five different players during that stretch and Gonzaga missed four 3-pointers as they fell behind.\nJames Madison started another run after that, outscoring Gonzaga 10-4 over the next 4 1/2 minutes to extend the lead to 27-19.\nCOLLEGE STATION, Texas (AP) - James Madison coach Kenny Brooks was enjoying breakfast on Sunday morning when he got a text from the team\u2019s trainer that put an immediate damper on his big day."}
