Chandrashekar Rao was quoted in a statement sent from his office. \u201cFamilies should be happy. They should lead healthy lives. If cheap liquor is available at lower prices, I am confident people will not drink Gudumba,\u201d Rao said.\n\nThe Telangana government\u2019s move is in contrast to other southern states such as Kerala, which is in the process of closing down booze shops in a phased manner. Political parties in Tamil Nadu have been pushing for a ban on liquor shops in the state. United Andhra Pradesh (before Telangana was bifurcated in June last year) had also seen spells of prohibition, when sale of liquor was banned.\n\nCheap liquor will be manufactured under the government\u2019s supervision and distributed through its channels. Chief minister Rao\u2019s office took care to point out that providing liquor at subsidized rates will mean a loss to the exchequer.\n\n\u201cSales of cheap liquor will lead to lower revenues for the government. Yet, it is fine,\u201d said Rao.\n\nIn the same tone, KCR, as Rao is popularly called, has declared a war against the Gudumba makers.\n\nAt a meeting with top officials to review the new excise policy, he identified a strong network that exists from villages, where Gudumba is manufactured, to sale points across the state. Illicitly brewed liquor is consumed at what are called belt shops.\n\n\u201cWe have to crush the network,\u201d KCR told officials. \u201cIf necessary, we should enforce PD (Preventive Detention) Act on those who make Gudumba,\u201d the chief minister said, asking the police and excise departments to collaborate to end the menace. The government will also reward informants.\n\nTelangana\u2019s new excise policy will take effect from 1 October.", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "1.0.4255054", "eomportal-id": 497591, "Last-Modified-Time": "11.43PM IST", "description": "The move is part of the govt\u2019s strategy to curb the consumption of Gudumba, a cheap, spurious liquor made in large parts of the state", "eomportal-instanceid": "S160.31", "Last-Modified-Date": "Sun, Aug 09, 2015", "og": {"site_name": "http://www.livemint.com/", "description": "The move is part of the govt\u2019s strategy to curb the consumption of Gudumba, a cheap, spurious liquor made in large parts of the state", "title": "Why KCR govt is offering subsidized cheap liquor in Telangana", "url": "http://www.livemint.com/Politics/3qOrfNMFhQJzHA75rUdLjN/Why-KCR-govt-is-offering-subsidized-cheap-liquor-in-Telangan.html", "image": "http://www.livemint.com/rf/Image-621x414/LiveMint/Period1/2015/08/10/Photos/chandrasekharrao-kvSG--621x414@LiveMint.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "livemint.com", "description": "The move is part of the govt\u2019s strategy to curb the consumption of Gudumba, a cheap, spurious liquor made in large parts of the state", "title": "Why KCR govt is offering subsidized cheap liquor in Telangana", "url": "http://www.livemint.com/Politics/3qOrfNMFhQJzHA75rUdLjN/Why-KCR-govt-is-offering-subsidized-cheap-liquor-in-Telangan.html", "image": {"src": "http://www.livemint.com/rf/Image-621x414/LiveMint/Period1/2015/08/10/Photos/chandrasekharrao-kvSG--621x414@LiveMint.jpg"}, "site": "@livemint", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Yogendra Kalavalapalli", "msvalidate.01": "F146C6DA8734CA14341A01D125A1F554", "robots": "index, follow, noodp, noydir", "eomportal-lastUpdate": "Fri May 27 17:35:37 IST 2016", "Last-Modified": "Sunday, 09 August, 2015 11:43:00PM", "fb": {"admins": 100006440206928, "app_id": 145745172237147, "pages": 170844986298918}, "tweetmeme-title": "Why KCR govt is offering subsidized cheap liquor in Telangana", "keywords": "Telangana, liqour, subsidy, K.
