Prince Charles and his wife Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, will pay Canada a visit in May, Governor General David Johnston has announced.

“Their Royal Highnesses The Prince of Wales and The Duchess of Cornwall have accepted the invitation of the Government of Canada to undertake a Royal Tour in May 2014, which will include stops in Manitoba, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island,” Johnston said in a statement. “The Royal Tour will be coordinated by the Canadian Secretary to The Queen, Mr. Kevin MacLeod, C.V.O., C.D., with a detailed programme to be released at a later date.”

The visit, Prime Minister Stephen Harper pointed out, comes at the start of five years of commemorations leading up to the 150th anniversary of the country’s formation in 2017. The outbreak of WWI 100 years ago kicks off the time period.

“I am pleased that Their Royal Highnesses will be joining us in a few months time as Canada enters a five-year period of significant national celebrations, beginning with the centennial of the outbreak of the Great War and the 150th anniversary of the Charlottetown and Québec City Conferences, which led to the creation of the Dominion of Canada,” Harper said in a statement. “Canadians look forward to having Their Royal Highnesses with us for these and other important moments in the history of our country.”

First Nations leaders met with Prince Charles in 2012 to seek an audience with Queen Elizabeth II for a reaffirmation of the treaties.
