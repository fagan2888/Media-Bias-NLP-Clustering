It looks as though he might have called a successful audible after being the 22nd overall pick in the NFL draft last month.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens with his football career,\u201d Padres closer Huston Street said. \u201cHe\u2019s potentially got a baseball one.\u201d\n\nHere are a few quarterbacks who turned down the baseball diamond for the football gridiron:\n\n___\n\nJOHN ELWAY\n\nA two-sport star in high school in California, Elway was drafted by the Kansas City Royals in the 18th round in 1979. He chose to go to Stanford, where he continued to play baseball and football. The Yankees drafted the slugging outfielder, who was also a hard-throwing pitcher, in the second round in 1981 \u2014 52nd overall, six spots ahead of Tony Gwynn \u2014 and he played for their short-season affiliate in Oneonta. Elway was selected No. 1 overall in the NFL draft by Baltimore in 1983, but unhappy with the team, he threatened the Colts that he would turn to baseball if they didn\u2019t trade him. Baltimore gave in and dealt him to Denver, where Elway forged a Hall of Fame career and won two Super Bowl rings.\n\n___\n\nDAN MARINO\n\nMarino was a right-handed pitcher and quarterback at Central Catholic High School in Pittsburgh, and drew interest for his skills in both sports. The Royals drafted him in the fourth round of the 1979 draft \u2014 yes, they took Elway and Marino in the same draft \u2014 but Marino opted to play football at the University of Pittsburgh. Good play call. Marino became one of the game\u2019s greatest quarterbacks, going in the first round to the Miami Dolphins in 1983, setting dozens of passing records and being inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2005.\n\n___\n\nTOM BRADY\n\nYep, the three-time Super Bowl champion and two-time MVP was a pretty good baseball player, too. So good, that he was drafted out of high school in the 18th round by the Montreal Expos in 1995 \u2014 as a catcher. He ended up not signing with the Expos and headed to the University of Michigan, where he worked his way up the depth chart from seventh to starter. He wasn\u2019t particularly highly touted coming out of college, going to New England in the sixth round. But, we all know what happened next.\n\n___\n\nMICHAEL VICK\n\nHe was such an amazing athlete that the Colorado Rockies drafted him as an outfielder out of Virginia Tech in the 30th round of the 2000 baseball draft \u2014 even though he hadn\u2019t played the sport since the eighth grade. Vick was the No. 1 overall pick in the 2001 NFL draft and became one of the game\u2019s most dynamic players with the Atlanta Falcons. After rejuvenating his career following a nearly two-year jail term for his role in a dogfighting ring, the soon-to-be 34-year-old Vick is with the New York Jets and competing with Geno Smith for the starting job.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Manziel joins list of QBs drafted by MLB teams", "author": "DENNIS WASZAK Jr.", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Manziel joins list of QBs drafted by MLB teams", "title": "Manziel joins list of QBs drafted by MLB teams", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/08/manziel_joins_list_of_qbs_drafted_by_mlb_teams/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/baseball-draft-mlb-qbs.jpeg1-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Manziel joins list of QBs drafted by MLB teams", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/baseball-draft-mlb-qbs.jpeg1-1280x960.jpg", "title": "Manziel joins list of QBs drafted by MLB teams", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Manziel joins list of QBs drafted by MLB teams", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd04dd\"", "article_summary": "He chose to go to Stanford, where he continued to play baseball and football.\nManziel likely won\u2019t ever play an inning of professional baseball, but he\u2019s not the first NFL quarterback who heard their name called during the MLB draft.\nSo good, that he was drafted out of high school in the 18th round by the Montreal Expos in 1995 \u2014 as a catcher.\n1 overall pick in the 2001 NFL draft and became one of the game\u2019s most dynamic players with the Atlanta Falcons.\nSure, Manziel was a terrific baseball player at Tivy High School in Kerrville, Texas, but he hasn\u2019t played the sport since so he could focus on football."}
