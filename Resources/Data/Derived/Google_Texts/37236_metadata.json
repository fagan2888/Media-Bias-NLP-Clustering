Once caught, he displayed to officers a supposed counter-terrorism shield and identification card, a local CBS News affiliate reported. No passengers were on board.\n\nPolice said they were able to catch the serial transit thief by honing in on the GPS signal broadcast by the bus, giving way to what the Guardian reported as being McCollum\u2019s 30th arrest in 34 years.\n\nMr. McCollum as a teenager hijacked a subway car in 1981 and since then has been arrested more than two dozen times for similar crimes involving trains and buses. In 2010, he stole a private bus from terminal in Hoboken, New Jersey, and drove it to John F. Kennedy International Airport.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m stealing a plane next,\u201d he allegedly told a detective after being caught this week, The New York Times reported.\n\nMr. McCollum was scheduled to be arraigned Thursday on charges of grand larceny and criminal impersonation of a police officer, but his attorney told reporters he shouldn\u2019t serve any more time, but should work with authorities instead to help identify weaknesses within the city\u2019s transportation system, CBS reported.\n\n\u201cHe walked with them through the system, showing them where things were vulnerable. And obviously, he still knows them,\u201d the attorney, Sally Butler, told the New York Post. \u201cIf anyone can walk up in Port Authority and steal a bus, do you think we need some assistance?\n\n\u201cThe city should be embarrassed if these allegations are true. Shame on them,\u201d the attorney added. \u201cWhat if they acknowledge what skill he has and utilize it? Here\u2019s a guy that obviously they need some help from, and instead, he\u2019s going to be sitting in Rikers Island for a couple years wasting everyone\u2019s money.\u201d\n\nBut according to one veteran bus driver, compromising the transit system\u2019s security measures isn\u2019t all that difficult.\n\n\u201cIf he looks legit, and has an identification, and shows them some kind of fake ID, it\u2019s pretty much easy to get in. If the driver is not securing his bus it\u2019s pretty easy to get into a bus and start it,\u201d the driver told CBS on condition of anonymity.\n\nIn a statement, Greyhound said it is \u201cfully cooperating with local authorities on their investigation and conducting an internal investigation of our own to obtain additional details regarding this incident.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Greyhound bus was stolen Wednesday from the Port Authority terminal in Manhattan by Darius McCollum, a 50-year-old New York resident who has been arrested dozens of times since the 1980s for crimes targeting mass transit, police said.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A Greyhound bus was stolen Wednesday from the Port Authority terminal in Manhattan by Darius McCollum, a 50-year-old New York resident who has been arrested dozens of times since the 1980s for crimes targeting mass transit, police said.", "title": "Darius McCollum, serial bus thief, takes Greyhound for NYC joyride", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/nov/13/darius-mccollum-serial-bus-thief-takes-greyhound-n/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/10/22/3ea343be7eab972f850f6a706700952c.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/10/22/3ea343be7eab972f850f6a706700952c.jpg", "description": "A Greyhound bus was stolen Wednesday from the Port Authority terminal in Manhattan by Darius McCollum, a 50-year-old New York resident who has been arrested dozens of times since the 1980s for crimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Darius McCollum, serial bus thief, takes Greyhound for NYC joyride"}, "Author": "Andrew Blake", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Law Crime, Darius Mccollum, Port Authority"}, "article_summary": "If the driver is not securing his bus it\u2019s pretty easy to get into a bus and start it,\u201d the driver told CBS on condition of anonymity.\n\u201cI\u2019m stealing a plane next,\u201d he allegedly told a detective after being caught this week, The New York Times reported.\nMr. McCollum took the bus from the midtown depot Wednesday afternoon and was behind the wheel for about two hours before being apprehended in Brooklyn, authorities said.\nOnce caught, he displayed to officers a supposed counter-terrorism shield and identification card, a local CBS News affiliate reported.\n\u201cIf anyone can walk up in Port Authority and steal a bus, do you think we need some assistance?"}
