The officer asked him what was in his hand, but he didn't respond. Police say the man held up his hand and pointed the object at the officer. That's when officer drew and fired his gun multiple times.\n\n\"The way this guy was acting, he felt his life was in danger. That's why he drew his gun and fired,\" Sioux Falls Police Public Information Officer Sam Clemens said.\n\nThe man ran off into the trees. Police aren't sure if the man actually shot at the officer, or if any of the officer's shots hit him.\n\nHomeowners living near Tuthill Park remain on edge after the officer-involved shooting Thursday.\n\n\"We are not exempt from anything but this is a quiet neighborhood,\" Mike Flyger said.\n\n\"We wouldn't have thought there would be someone armed in our backyard,\" Nicole Hempel said.\n\nAs the search continues for a man police believe pointed a gun at an officer, Tuthill Park neighbors are keeping a close eye on their homes.\n\n\"We definitely heard five to six shots, rapid fire, and then nothing after that,\" Hempel said.\n\nHempel heard the shots Thursday night. Friday, she's keeping her young son inside their home, which backs up to the park.\n\nFlyger also checked his property for any suspicious activity.\n\n\"You know, we are concerned for the safety of others and the safety of the person who allegedly did what he did,\" Flyger said.\n\nPolice aren't sure where the suspect ran or whether he's a danger to the public. In the meantime, neighbors here remain uneasy.\n\n\"Yeah, I'm concerned that there was someone armed in my backyard. That is a very scary feeling. I do have utmost confidence in our police department so I'm quite certain they will find this person. But until then, yeah, I will feel worried about having something in our backyard,\" Hempel said.\n\nSome of the neighbors who heard the gunfire called police to help in the investigation.\n\nPolice say they are asking for any tips that would help them find the suspect.\n\nNews\n\nCrime {{Title}} Remove Change News General Courts Web Only Crime Outdoors Events Center Non-Homepage Boredom Busters Pipeline Positively KELOLAND Technology Hunger Affordable Care Act Shops Flooding Remembering 9/11 Drought JazzFest Spring Storm Honor Flight Spencer Anniversary\n\nDoApp Health News Business News Sports\n\nAgriculture Markets Livestock Crops Politics\n\nHealthBeat Cancer Children's Health Heart Health Wellness & Nutrition General Health Beat Women's Health RX Resources What's Going Around OTC Diabetes Recalls Dental Health Men's Health\n\nPolitics South Dakota Legislature Budget Congress Taxes General Local Campaign President US Senate New Laws US House Iowa Ballot Issues Local Races Minnesota Gubernatorial\n\nEducation Funding College Elementary High School Pre K School Supplies Middle School\n\nSports Professional College High School Sports Zone Headlines Summit League Tournament Olympics\n\nBusiness Industry Your Money Matters Development Gas & Energy Legislation Economy/Stocks Employment General Health Care Technology Education Funding Tourism Banking/Finance Housing Transportation Insurance Meetings & Events Retail & Restaurants All Industries On The Move Shops Agriculture\n\nFeatured Stories Eye on KELOLAND Inside KELOLAND\n\nWeather Snow Forecast Records Rain Flooding Drought WX Corner General\n\nWorld News\n\nInvestigates GEAR UP\n\nSponsored Done\n\n\u00a9 2016 KELOLAND TV.
