GREELEY — Chris Bonner threw three touchdown passes for Colorado State-Pueblo, helping the powerhouse Division II team leave Nottingham Field with a 41-36 victory over Northern Colorado on Saturday in the ThunderWolves’ first game against an FCS team.

Bonner finished 20-of-36 passing for 267 yards. The 6-foot-7, 225-pound junior quarterback from San Diego threw all of his TD passes in the second quarter, lifting the ThunderWolves to a 28-23 lead at halftime in their season opener.

Sophomore running back Cameron McDondle, a Columbine High School graduate, ran 2 yards for a CSU-Pueblo touchdown in the middle of the fourth quarter.

UNC running back Tromaine Dennis scored twice in the second half and finished with a game-high 102 yards rushing. In the third quarter, defensive back LaRon Tarkington scored on a 66-yard interception return that put CSU-Pueblo in front to stay with a 34-29 lead.

Senior quarterback Seth Lobato completed 29-of-45 passes for 390 yards and three touchdowns for the Bears, who gained 25 first downs and 497 total yards but fell to 1-1.

“We never thought we couldn’t do it,” said CSU-Pueblo coach John Wristen. “We were able to get some things going and get some momentum, and there was a snowball effect. It’s just a heck of a victory for us.”
