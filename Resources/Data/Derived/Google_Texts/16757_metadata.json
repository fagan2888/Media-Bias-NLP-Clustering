Correspondent for LifeSiteNews and a former blogger with Tea Party Patriots, the nation\u2019s largest Tea Party organization. He is co-author of the forthcoming book \u201cBankrupt Legacy: The Future of the Debt-Paying Generation,\u201d which examines the implications of high national debt for young Americans. His work has been published by Roll Call, Huffington Post, National Review Online, and many other publications. The opinions expressed are his own.\n\nEric Holder is at it again.\n\nNot satisfied with his role in the disastrous and illegal Fast & Furious, Attorney General Holder has compounded his errors in that scandal by choosing what laws to defend (or break) throughout his time as the nation\u2019s top legal person.\n\nNow, Huffington Post reports Holder is telling state Attorney Generals to follow in his illegal footsteps and ignore state laws on same-sex \u201cmarriage.\u201d He also compared defending the Defense of Marriage Act to defending segregation laws in the 1950s.\n\nFortunately, at least two state Attorney Generals are standing firm:\n\n\u201dWhen legal arguments exist to defend a law, it is the duty of the Office of the Attorney General under North Carolina law to make those arguments in court regardless of whether I agree with the law,\u201d said North Carolina Attorney General Roy Cooper (D), who personally supports same-sex marriage. \u201cIt really isn\u2019t [Holder's] job to give us advice on defending our constitutions any more than it\u2019s our role to give him advice on how to do his job,\u201d Wisconsin Attorney General J.B. Van Hollen (R) told the Times. \u201cWe are the ultimate defenders of our state constitutions.\u201d\n\nArkansas\u2019 Democratic Attorney General has said in the past that he will defend his state\u2019s marriage laws, even though he personally disagrees with them. This principled stand for the rule of law is in direct contrast to the many state Democratic Attorney Generals who are choosing personal preference over the law, including Virginia\u2019s brand-new Attorney General, Mark Herring.\n\nRepublicans in Congress must do whatever they can to impeach Holder and otherwise hold him accountable. Not only is the nation\u2019s top legal voice choosing what laws to break, uphold, and/or invent, he is now advising others to violate their oaths of office to uphold state constitutions and laws.\n\nAre all laws just? Absolutely not. But regardless of whether Holder or any other Attorney General supports same-sex \u201cmarriage,\u201d it is definitely not their job to pick and choose what laws to defend. Otherwise, the rule of law means nothing, and anarchy will fill the gap.\n\nFurthermore, it sets a terrible precedent among the political parties. After all, what is to stop the next Republican Attorney General from not upholding parts of the Affordable Care Act, or any abortion laws? Democrats would, of course, oppose any Attorney General who did this.\n\nHolder had already said he will leave his office this year. It looks like he\u2019s intent on doing as much damage to the nation as possible before he bows out. Republicans should make sure he feels the consequences of that damage in order to protect the nation from this lawbreaking hypocrite.\n\n\u2013\n\nTheBlaze contributor channel supports an open discourse on a range of views.
