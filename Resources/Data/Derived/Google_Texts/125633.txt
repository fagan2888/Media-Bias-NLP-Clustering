How it works Benefitfocus offers its clients a cloud-based subscription service to help them manage and streamline their benefits plans, and in so doing, has become one of the largest benefits software companies in the United States. It offers two basic products — one for employers (among the company's clients are Under Armour, New Balance, Dannon, Triumph Foods and Brooks Brothers) and one for carriers (it works with Prudential, MetLife, UnitedHealth and more than 30 BlueCross partners, among others).

Frankly, technology is a long time coming for the benefits industry, Jenkins says. “In other industries, we’ve certainly seen technology come through — whether it's the music industry or the travel industry,” Jenkins says. “But the benefits industry is much bigger than the music industry or air travel — so it's taking longer. But it's vital. You need to be on the right side of the technology equation.”
