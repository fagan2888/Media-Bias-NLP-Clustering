Kay Hagan.\n\nAmericans for Prosperity, a group co-founded by the conservative billionaires, has already dropped $8.2 million on TV, radio and digital ads in an effort to defeat the North Carolina Democrat. According to sources tracking media buys, the group has so far spent more in North Carolina than all Democratic outside groups in every Senate race in the country \u2014 combined.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nAnd while AFP won\u2019t predict the amount it will ultimately spend in North Carolina, if the conservative group keeps the same pace, it\u2019ll spend more than $27 million by Election Day in the Tar Heel State. That\u2019s more than twice what any outside group has spent in the past dozen years in North Carolina congressional races.\n\nThe staggering figures make North Carolina ground zero in the unprecedented TV war expected to define the 2014 midterm elections. Powerful outside groups like AFP can now raise and spend unlimited money, empowering big donors to single-handedly reshape a race and even determine which party controls the Senate for the final two years of Barack Obama\u2019s presidency.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: AFP drops $1.4M on Hagan ad buy)\n\n\u201cIt concerns me; it ought to concern anybody,\u201d said Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee in Washington. \u201cIt\u2019s just not fair to have two folks in the country potentially determine the outcomes of these Senate races in states where they don\u2019t even live.\u201d\n\nWith Republicans eyeing at least six seats to take back the Senate, North Carolina has emerged as one of their best shots, with Hagan vulnerable from the onslaught of televised attacks over her support for Obamacare and with the state showing big swings in public opinion since Obama won the state six years ago.\n\nWith Republican candidates and its main party committee still behind many of their Democratic counterparts in the money chase, AFP is filling a critical void nine months out from Election Day.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Koch World 2014)\n\nThe Koch-backed group, a nonprofit that does not have to disclose its donors, has no plans to let up. Through last week, AFP had spent more than $12 million in the country\u2019s six closest Senate races, amounting to two-thirds of total money spent by GOP groups nationally, according to media trackers. The Koch group\u2019s spending exceeds the $7.6 million-plus spent by all Senate Democratic groups combined in the competitive races, including less than $4 million that Democrats have so far spent in North Carolina media markets \u2014 some of the country\u2019s most expensive.\n\nHagan and her campaign now are trying to tie the Kochs\u2019 conservative agenda to one of her potential opponents \u2014 state House Speaker Thom Tillis, arguing he championed through the Legislature the group\u2019s controversial far-right agenda on issues ranging from slashing unemployment benefits to cutting teacher tenure.\n\n\u201cThe people of North Carolina need to know what their agenda is,\u201d Hagan said in an interview of David and Charles Koch, the owners of the multinational manufacturing firm Koch Industries. \u201cThey want to have tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy and, at the same time, put that burden on the middle class and the poor. They want to cut Medicare, Social Security. All of these issues are so, so important to the middle class.\u201d\n\nBut in an interview, AFP President Tim Phillips said the group\u2019s agenda rests strictly on one thing: Repealing Obamacare. And already this election season, it has spent $28 million blasting both Democratic Senate and House candidates since last August for their support of the controversial law.\n\n( Also on POLITICO Magazine: I punk'd Scott Walker)\n\nA top priority of the group for years, North Carolina was one of the first states where it set up local chapters, helping build what Phillips says is one of its \u201cdeepest state infrastructures,\u201d with more than 130,000 activists that helped defeat a Medicaid expansion in the state Legislature last year and now is singularly focused on defeating Hagan.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been engaged in the state for a decade,\u201d Phillips said. \u201cThat preceded Sen. Hagan coming into office, and I suspect Americans for Prosperity will be healthy and vibrant in North Carolina long after she is no longer in the U.S. Senate.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "North Carolina has become a focal point in efforts to define the midterm elections.", "og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "North Carolina has become a focal point in efforts to define the midterm elections.", "title": "Koch brothers bombard Senate Dem", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/02/koch-brothers-kay-hagan-103406.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/02/11/charles_koch_hagan_david_koch_ap_328.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "keywords": "Elections,Kay Hagan,David Koch,2014 Elections,Koch Brothers,Charles Koch,Americans For Prosperity", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/Annapalmerpolitico/"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9352\"", "article_summary": "| AP Photos Koch brothers bombard Senate DemThe Koch brothers have a seemingly bottomless pot of cash this election year \u2014 and no one knows it better than Sen.
