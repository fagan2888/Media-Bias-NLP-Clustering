Jeanne Shaheen doesn\u2019t seem to like them very much.\n\nThe Republican opponent Scott Brown\u2019s campaign recently sent a memo to reporters contrasting his candidate\u2019s \u201copen and accessible style of campaigning\u201d with Shaheen\u2019s, pointing out that the Democrat has yet to hold a town hall meeting with voters this election cycle.\n\nOn its website, the New Hampshire Republican Party launched a countdown clock noting the last time Shaheen held a town hall (714 days, 21 hours, 29 minutes, 54 seconds at the time this was written Wednesday).\n\nAnd now, the New Hampshire GOP is sending a staffer dressed in a chicken suit to a Shaheen event holding the sign: \u201cJeanne Shaheen Too Chicken For Town Halls.\u201d\n\nIronically, while Shaheen isn\u2019t holding town halls of her own, her supporters are attempting to crash Brown\u2019s voter gatherings to ask the Republican questions about his campaign.\n\nThe Daily Caller obtained an email sent this week by Joanne St. John, a member of the Nashua Democratic City Committee, asking fellow Democrats to show up to Brown\u2019s \u201cObamacare Isn\u2019t Working\u201d town hall and pepper him with questions about the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cThe Scott Brown Townhall in Nashua tomorrow night has just been posted online,\u201d St. John wrote. \u201cWe need to get as many people there that are prepared to ask questions.\u201d\n\n\u201cIdeally, we would like to have as many people as possible that have benefited from ACA show up and tell him why he is wrong about ACA,\u201d St. John added.\n\nA Shaheen campaign spokeswoman did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\nBrown campaign manager Colin Reed told The Daily Caller, \u201cWe welcome people of all political stripes at our town hall meetings.\u201d\n\n\u201cSince Senator Shaheen refuses to hold town halls this election cycle, the people of New Hampshire have no choice but to come to our events to ask questions about Obamacare, illegal immigration and how the Obama/Shaheen agenda has weakened America at home and around the world,\u201d he said.\n\nBrown\u2019s campaign says he plans to continue doing town halls, including a joint event next week with Arizona Sen. John McCain on foreign policy.\n\nFollow Alex on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Alex Pappas", "description": "No state knows town hall meetings like New Hampshire", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "No state knows town hall meetings like New Hampshire.
