(REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst)\n\n4304723\n\nVice President Joe Biden railed against corporations in a combative Labor Day Parade speech in Detroit with union bosses and their members in attendance \u2013 speaking with such passion that even when he made up the name of a fictional historical American president the crowd applauded.\n\nBiden delivered his speech at the site of the demolished Tiger Stadium ballpark, standing onstage with local Democrats including embattled anti-Obamacare Teamsters boss Jimmy Hoffa Jr., who handed the vice president water and got first-name references in what basically amounted to a Biden stump speech.\n\nWATCH:\n\n\u201cWhy do CEO\u2019s now make 333 times more money than the line worker when back when [WAGER?] was president, they made 25 times what the line worker,\u201d Biden said (10:40). \u201cWhat happened? What happened?\u201d\n\nPresident who? Wager? President Way-gur? Did the vice president start saying \u201cReagan\u201d and then realize halfway through that he shouldn\u2019t? Or did he just make the name up?\n\n\u201cAs long as I\u2019m around, as long as the guys behind me are around, we\u2019re going to fight with every breath in us to make sure we re-establish the bargain,\u201d Biden said (20:40).\n\nBut the guy behind you hates your bargain, Joe. In fact, it was Jimmy Hoffa Jr. who wrote to Congress in 2013 complaining that Obamacare \u201cwill destroy the foundation of the 40 hour work week that is the backbone of the American middle class.\u201d Republican Sen. Ted Cruz even cited Hoffa\u2019s letter in his quasi-filibuster against Obamacare before the government shutdown. (RELATED: Hoffa Tries To Squash His Own Employees\u2019 Union)\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been chipped away at, constantly, just like unions have,\u201d Biden railed. \u201cIt\u2019s time to take back America. It\u2019s time to change the tax code. It\u2019s time to make sure you get an equal share. Because if we don\u2019t, America\u2019s in trouble.\u201d\n\nBiden offered generous praise to the union leaders, including Hoffa.\n\n\u201cHad the Teamsters, and AFSCME and the Building trade, and every single union here not taken to the streets when they had to, generation after generation, to pressure for the expanse of the rights of workers, we wouldn\u2019t have, as Jimmy pointed out, the forty-hour week,\u201d Biden said. \u201cIt\u2019s not hyperbole. Unions did in fact build the middle class. And here\u2019s what that did. That built the United States of America as we know it.\u201d\n\n\u201cGod bless you. Don\u2019t give up. Keep dreaming. We\u2019re going to come back,\u201d Biden concluded after noting that people in Washington call him \u201cMiddle Class Joe\u201d and that the moniker is not meant as a compliment there.\n\nWhether starring in the Obama campaign\u2019s auto-bailout action movie for the 2012 Democratic National Convention or convening a post-Newtown gun control Q + A to encouraged people to scorn semi-automatics and instead get themselves double-barreled shotguns, Biden has been the administration\u2019s reliable mascot for outreach to the old union-led Democratic establishment.\n\nBut Biden\u2019s speech Monday, with its numerous criticisms of contemporary life, suggest the rumblings of a presidential campaign.\n\nJust like President Wager.\n\nFollow Patrick on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Patrick Howley", "description": "Jimmy Hoffa Jr. gets love from the Veep", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Vice President Joe Biden railed against corporations in a combative Labor Day Parade speech in Detroit with union bosses and their members in attendance - speaking with such passion that even when he", "title": "Joe Biden Cites Fictional President In Speech With Union Bosses [VIDEO]", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/09/01/joe-biden-cites-fictional-president-in-speech-with-union-bosses-video/", "image": {"width": 794, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/2014-08-05T151029Z_1_LYNXMPEA740NM_RTROPTP_4_AFRICA-SUMMIT-e1407958887212.jpg", "height": 340}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Jimmy Hoffa Jr. gets love from the Veep", "title": "Joe Biden Cites Fictional President In Speech With Union Bosses [VIDEO] Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/09/01/joe-biden-cites-fictional-president-in-speech-with-union-bosses-video/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/2014-08-05T151029Z_1_LYNXMPEA740NM_RTROPTP_4_AFRICA-SUMMIT-e1407958887212.jpg"}, "creator": "@patrickhowleydc", "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-09-01 18:21:31", "sailthru.title": "Joe Biden Cites Fictional President In Speech With Union Bosses [VIDEO]", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "sailthru.tags": "joe-biden,patrick-howley", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "keywords": "jimmy hoffa jr.,joe biden,teamsters", "sailthru.description": "Vice President Joe Biden railed against corporations in a combative Labor Day Parade speech in Detroit with union bosses and their members in attendance - speaking with such passion that even when he", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/2014-08-05T151029Z_1_LYNXMPEA740NM_RTROPTP_4_AFRICA-SUMMIT-e1407958887212.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Vice President Joe Biden talks about rooting out corruption as he addresses a civil society forum during the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit in Washington Aug. 4, 2014.\nDid the vice president start saying \u201cReagan\u201d and then realize halfway through that he shouldn\u2019t?\n(REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst)4304723Vice President Joe Biden railed against corporations in a combative Labor Day Parade speech in Detroit with union bosses and their members in attendance \u2013 speaking with such passion that even when he made up the name of a fictional historical American president the crowd applauded.\nWe\u2019re going to come back,\u201d Biden concluded after noting that people in Washington call him \u201cMiddle Class Joe\u201d and that the moniker is not meant as a compliment there.\nBiden delivered his speech at the site of the demolished Tiger Stadium ballpark, standing onstage with local Democrats including embattled anti-Obamacare Teamsters boss Jimmy Hoffa Jr., who handed the vice president water and got first-name references in what basically amounted to a Biden stump speech."}
