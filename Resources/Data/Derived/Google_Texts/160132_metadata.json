Richard M. Burr is paying close attention.\n\nThe Trump effect \u2014 which includes the success of Dr. Ben Carson and probably Carly Fiorina as well \u2014 is something for members to ignore at their own peril, with 24 Republican senators up for re-election in 2016 and congressional disapproval in the 60s , \u201cWhen you look at what they\u2019ve tapped into, they\u2019ve tapped into a frustration of the American people at the lack of solutions that come out of Washington \u2014 that government\u2019s not working on their behalf,\u201d the North Carolina senator said. \u201cIt\u2019s been done quite effectively on the part of Trump.\u201d\n\nTrump, Burr said, embodies a large swath of voter frustration over issues seemingly overlooked in Washington, with the billionaire candidate stepping into an opening that he, so far, has been able to capitalize on with little more than broad policy strokes.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s how he can successfully paint the picture for folks without the specificity for what his solution is,\u201d Burr said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have to do that yet. And there\u2019s an incredible lesson there for candidates in the future.\u201d\n\nIf Washington is the problem, then being an outsider candidate is the solution \u2014 no easy feat for those who have served in Washington for years. Burr routinely tells voters in speeches and interviews that he shares their frustration, having spent years in the private sector selling outdoor power equipment and consumer electronics.\n\n\u201cI can relate to it because I came out of business and the political approach to everything is a very frustrating and foreign thing to me that I don\u2019t think I have adopted in the 21 years that I\u2019ve been there,\u201d Burr said. \u201cAnd I try to make sure that I don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nThroughout the GOP presidential primary, baffled candidates have tried to duplicate the outsiders\u2019 success. From seemingly absurd policy suggestions , to constitutionally dubious arguments (see: birthright citizenship and the Fourteenth Amendment), to plain ol\u2019 picking fights , others have tried and thus far failed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not something that comes natural to a lot of my colleagues,\u201d Burr said. \u201cSome of them, who are in the presidential race, try to emulate what he\u2019s doing and have not successfully done that \u2014 and it\u2019s quite a list of them.\u201d\n\nBut whether Trump's and the outsiders\u2019 success will last remains to be seen.\n\n\u201cI think the only question is not whether he\u2019s hitting on something that really does penetrate these folks \u2014 he\u2019s hitting real issues, he\u2019s hitting real emotions,\u201d Burr said. \u201cIs the emotion that he\u2019s hitting sustainable throughout the length of the (campaign)? And at what point will [voters] require a level of detail, if at all, that gives them a comfort level?\u201d\n\nBurr points to the 2008 election as proof that the Trump effect has been building for a while, and not just among Republicans, where it was largely frustration with Washington and not policy details that delivered Obama both the Democratic nomination and the White House.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t beat Hillary Clinton because of detail,\u201d Burr said. \u201c[He won] because the majority of Democrats and some Republicans and independents saw him as a champion of their concerns, of their frustrations, of their interests.\u201d\n\nBut even outsiders who want to fix Washington will have to work within the current system. The Constitution and its separation of powers still governs the land. Ever since promising an extra hour at recess and better food in the cafeteria, candidates have had a tendency to say things on the trail that may sound good but aren\u2019t supported by the process.\n\n\u201cThere are some things all the candidates say on the campaign trail that sound nice, but they\u2019re just not true,\u201d Burr said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the frustrating thing also being on the inside. You\u2019d like to go out and say \u2018Well once you\u2019re here you\u2019ll realize why you can\u2019t do that structurally, procedurally, whatever.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can say [birthright citizenship is] constitutionally questioned, yeah, but it would still probably take legislation to clarify that,\u201d Burr added. \u201cIf it got to the Supreme Court, I\u2019m not sure that they would rule that you could do something. So, I have to live within the framework of laws that they don\u2019t have to to make their comments.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s actually an argument that plays out within Congress all the time. Republican leadership, which controls both chambers, often points to a 60-vote threshold in the Senate and a Democratic president as reasons why certain things can\u2019t get done right now, such as blocking federal funding to Planned Parenthood or a total repeal of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nRank-and-file Republicans often criticize leadership for not doing enough. A prime example, which hit close to home for Burr, played out just before recess in the House as North Carolina Rep. Mark Meadows introduced a bill to remove Burr\u2019s close friend, John A. Boehner of Ohio, as speaker of the House.\n\nBurr recalled when his current Senate colleague, but former House colleague, Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., made a similar move against then-Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, R-Ga. Defending Meadows, Burr noted that Graham would hardly be considered a trouble maker now, at least not as someone would try to overthrow leadership.\n\n\u201c[Meadows] was trying to do what either he thought he needed to do or what the institution needed,\u201d Burr said. \u201cI didn\u2019t have any problem with it.\n\nUltimately, Burr would like to see federal spending reined in, the government shrunk and more power handed to the people, acknowledging that getting from \u201chere to there is a pretty lengthy thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut America\u2019s going to figure it out because you can\u2019t afford this course and you can\u2019t get by too much longer with failure,\u201d Burr said. \u201cAnd I sort of go back to where Trump is. That just summed up in one sentence what his whole campaign\u2019s about and that\u2019s why I\u2019m not surprised that it\u2019s having the impact that it is.\u201d\n\nRelated: DSCC Talking to Potential Burr Challengers", "article_metadata": {"description": "RALEIGH, N.C. \u2014\u00a0As the GOP establishment, the media and just about everyone else tries to wrap their minds around the success and seeming invincibility of Donald Trump, Sen.
