Last year Colorado enacted the nation\u2019s first rules to cut methane pollution, but climate change and air pollution don\u2019t stop at state borders, they said.\n\n\u201cAs a mom, I care deeply about my the health of my children and what the world will be like when they grow up,\u201d said Annie Ekblad, a Windsor resident. \u201cThat\u2019s why I am demanding the EPA take action to regulate methane.\u201d\n\nMoms Clean Air Force says on its website that it is a \u201ccommunity of hundreds of thousands of moms \u2014 and dads! \u2014 working together to combat air pollution, including the urgent crisis of our changing climate.\u201d The group held its news conference on May 29.\n\nTwo days earlier in Denver, Gov. John Hickenlooper, a Democrat, and U.S. Sen. Cory Gardner, a Republican, discussed Colorado\u2019s energy future at a breakfast.
