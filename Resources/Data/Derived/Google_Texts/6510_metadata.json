(See the complete scorecard here.)\n\nBackers of the campaign -- which they are calling a \"buycott\" -- ask that devotees of the Bible shift their shopping habits toward companies that score well on their scale.\n\n\"Just in time for the busy Christmas shopping season\u2014we launched our ground-breaking new scoring system rating major brands on their relative faith-compatibility,\" states the campaign. \"As a rapidly emerging and economically powerful movement with a legitimate voice in the public square, Faith Driven Consumers comprise 17 percent of the population \u2013 41 million Americans \u2013 and spend $2 trillion annually.\"\n\nOrganizers point out that not one company earned so much as a 65 on the scale.\n\n\"The FEI establishes a benchmark\u2014a starting point\u2014that brands can improve upon,\" states the campaign.\n\nPoliticos will note that executives at the highest scoring companies have made headlines for opposing same sex marriage (Chick-fil-A) and Obamacare contraceptive distribution (Hobby Lobby), among other polarizing causes. At the other end of the scale, Apple and others were dinged for not specifically reaching out to religious consumers.\n\nThe campaign is operating on social media under the hashtag #AddUsIn, referencing the desire for corporations to include Christians as a \"protected class\" of American citizens.\n\n\"It's important for everyone to understand what we are asking Corporate America to do\u2014acknowledge us on equal footing with the other groups they embrace and celebrate,\" writes the campaign.\n\nThe highest and lowest scoring corporations are listed in the slideshow above to do with as you will.\n\nThe complete ratings are broken out by industry here.\n\nSo, if you identify as a Christian it may be time to mentally prepare to find a car battery or hunk of cheese under your Christmas tree.", "article_metadata": {"SKYPE_TOOLBAR": "SKYPE_TOOLBAR_PARSER_COMPATIBLE", "sailthru.author": "Bill Disbrow", "vf": {"section": "business", "unique_id": "sfgate-article-6611161"}, "og": {"site_name": "SFGate", "description": "A Christian group wants you to shop based on your beliefs this holiday season, and they've created a guide to make it simple.", "title": "Here's where Christians are and are not supposed to shop this holiday season", "url": "http://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Here-s-where-Christians-are-and-are-not-supposed-6611161.php", "image": "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/31/62/07/6758898/5/rawImage.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@SFGate", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@bdisbrow"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-11-08 4:00:00 -0800", "sailthru.title": "Here's where Christians are and are not supposed to shop this holiday season", "msvalidate.01": "9451CA04ABC9D1D5C6419C73B4C4F7B7", "fb": {"admins": 100006394927810, "app_id": 1609422252616351}, "format-detection": "telephone=no", "sailthru.tags": "section-business,pubname-san-francisco-chronicle", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "T-Mobile: Score - 19 Photo: Amy Sussman, Associated Press Image 18 of 18 Here's where Christians are and are not supposed to shop this holiday season 1 / 18 Back to GalleryA Christian group wants you to shop based on your beliefs this holiday season, and they've created a guide to make it simple.\nHere's where Christians are and are not supposed to shop this holiday seasonPhoto: Chuck Beckley, Associated Press Image 1 of / 18 Caption Close Image 1 of 18 Here are the most 'faith friendly' corporations, according to Faith Driven Consumer - 1.\nNationwide: Score - 16 Photo: 2015 NASCAR Image 13 of 18 6T Pfizer: Score - 16 6T Pfizer: Score - 16 Photo: Elise Amendola, Associated Press Image 14 of 18 7T.\nBank of America - score 11 Photo: Mark Lennihan, Associated Press Image 10 of 18 3.\nTyson Foods: score 60 Photo: April L Brown, Associated Press Image 5 of 18 5."}
