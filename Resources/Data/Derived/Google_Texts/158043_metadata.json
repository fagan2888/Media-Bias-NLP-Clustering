Biden Jr.\n\nThe economist Alan Blinder and I were recently discussing whether technology was making a serious dent in job growth. Technically, we were considering whether the pace at which labor-saving technology is entering the workforce has accelerated \u2014 that is, whether the likelihood of \u201ctechnological unemployment\u201d had grown \u2014 when he suggested this thought experiment:\n\nToday's Economist Perspectives from expert contributors.\n\nSay you were Thomas Jefferson\u2019s chief economist and you\u2019d just somehow seen a report from the year 2013 showing that 1.5 percent of the workforce was in agriculture, as opposed to the 90 percent in your day. You ran to the president with news of this crisis, telling him we\u2019ve got to start preparing for mass unemployment.\n\nAlas, like most similar warnings throughout history, yours would have been wrong. While productivity in farming has grown tremendously, displacing millions of workers, they\u2019ve mostly found work elsewhere. That\u2019s not at all meant to dismiss the disruption caused by technological progress on the lives of those displaced. It is simply to state that the predictions of the type we\u2019re hearing more and more of \u2014 these days, about how robotics and digitized intelligence are finally going to cast us into unemployment in large numbers \u2014 have been wrong for centuries.\n\nOf course, that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re wrong now. And in fact, a few years ago I plotted some data points that surprised me and many others. The plot simply compared the growth of productivity to that of employment (using \u201cfull-time equivalents\u201d for the latter, so that two half-time jobs are counted as one full-time job).\n\nPhoto\n\nThe standard view, the one that dismisses Jefferson\u2019s shocked economist, derives from the fact that the two lines track each other for decades. I\u2019ll explain why that\u2019s been true in a moment, but what\u2019s surprising here is the fact that this decades-long relationship appears to have broken down in recent years. A natural question is whether that gap toward the end of the chart is the work of robots or other labor-displacing technologies of the type discussed by Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee in their compelling new book on this question, \u201cThe Second Machine Age.\u201d\n\nBefore we get to the split in the lines, let\u2019s discuss the decades of uniform growth (and longer historical charts show the same thing). A tiny bit of math from a recent analysis by the economist Lawrence Mishel, a critic of the robots-are-coming hypothesis, turns out to be elucidating.\n\nFirst, Y = (Y/L)*L where Y is output, or gross domestic product, and L is hours worked, which you can think of as jobs. Now, with a bit more algebra, including taking natural logs, you quickly end up with:\n\nJob Growth = Output Growth \u2014 Productivity Growth\n\nWith constant output growth, more efficient production (faster productivity growth) means fewer jobs, which is pretty much common sense: If we can produce the same output in fewer hours, we need less work to hold steady. But of course output has been anything but constant. The intervening variable, which has always glued those two lines together, is greater demand for the additional goods and services we can produce by dint of our increasing productivity. The fact that more efficient production typically lowers prices is a key part of the demand boost.\n\nTherefore, the first thing your average macroeconomist would think when looking toward the end of the figure above is not \u201crobots!\u201d It\u2019s \u201cweak growth!\u201d And that, in fact, is what Mr. Mishel finds. Here are his annualized growth numbers to fill into the little formula above for the last two business cycles: 1989-2000 and 2000-2007 (of course, since 2007, both growth and jobs have been cyclically depressed). Remember, it\u2019s job growth equals G.D.P. growth minus productivity growth.\n\nThe 1990s: 1.5% = 3.3% \u2014 1.8%\n\nThe 2000s: 0.3% = 2.4% \u2014 2.1%\n\nLooking to the right of the equal sign, what really changed in the 2000s was output growth, which fell almost a point (to 2.4 percent from 3.3 percent) over the period where the lines above diverge. Yes, productivity accelerated a bit, but had growth remained constant at 3.3 percent, we would have added jobs at a rate of 1.2 percent per year (3.3 percent minus 2.1 percent) instead of a measly 0.3 percent. That fourfold difference would have amounted to seven million more full-time jobs.\n\nSo weak growth and demand is the culprit. But \u201cweak demand\u201d is itself a pretty amorphous explanation. Perhaps that maps onto the tech story, with capital equipment replacing workers faster than normal, so that there\u2019s more unemployment, less consumer spending, and weaker output growth.\n\nMaybe, but that, too, is hard to see in the numbers, and it also has some tough competitors. That is, there are other explanations for the especially weak demand growth in the 2000s. Capital investment \u2014 spending on business equipment, including software and robotics \u2014 slowed in the 2000s relative to the 1990s, and while productivity accelerated slightly, it too has since slowed. On the other hand, Moore\u2019s Law means that as time progresses, businesses can buy a lot more computing power for a lot less.\n\nStill, this line of reasoning hardly makes sense. If technological advances lead to both fewer jobs and less growth for the length of a whole business cycle, why undertake them?\n\nIn fact, the 2000s were characterized by particularly large trade deficits that sapped domestic demand, along with a large and destructive increase in financial \u201cinnovation\u201d that fueled a housing bubble from which we\u2019re still recovering. True, the bubble spun off a construction boom and \u201cwealth effect\u201d that created some jobs in those years, but not enough to offset the slowdown in underlying demand. And again, exploding synthetic derivatives and a housing glut are not what the technologists have in mind when they analyze how robotics and artificial intelligence are improving the economy. Since that bubble burst, joblessness has been driven by cyclical forces and austere public policy.\n\nNone of this is dispositive evidence against either President Jefferson\u2019s economist or Mr. Brynjolfsson and Mr. McAfee, who present a lot of anecdotal indicators of labor-saving advances that could conceivably increase the rate of technological unemployment going forward. But for now, I see nothing in either the data or the anecdotes that leads me to conclude that labor-saving technology is preventing us from getting back to full employment. To explain that, I\u2019d invoke a far more evident culprit: the damaging policy set that has brought us bubbles and busts coupled with political resistance to the necessary policies to help get things back on track.\n\nMy argument regarding the question posed above is simple: Before we can assess the state of technological unemployment, we have to get rid of bad policy-induced unemployment. At that point, perhaps we can get a better handle on what the robots are really up to.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20140217000116, "BN": "economix", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "businessday/economix", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/economix/post", "per": "Brynjolfsson, Erik;McAfee, Andrew P;Mishel, Lawrence", "keywords": "Brynjolfsson Erik,McAfee Andrew P,Mishel Lawrence,Gross Domestic Product,Labor and Jobs,Productivity,Robots and Robotics,United States Economy,Today's Economist", "ad_sensitivity": "noxxl", "GBLC": "Today's Economist", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/economix/Before Blaming the Robots, Let's Get the Policy Right  ( 20140217 )", "PT": "Blogs", "author": "Jared Bernstein", "SCG": "Economy", "sourceApp": "blogs", "CLMST": "Jared Bernstein", "byl": "Jared Bernstein", "twitter": {"description": "Job growth has ceased to track productivity growth in recent years, but whether and how technology has been a factor is hard to discern because of other damage to the economy, an economist writes.", "title": "Before Blaming the Robots, Let's Get the Policy Right", "url": "http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/17/before-blaming-the-robots-lets-get-the-policy-right/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "site": "@nyteconomix", "card": "summary"}, "blogpostid": 100000002715984, "description": "Job growth has ceased to track productivity growth in recent years, but whether and how technology has been a factor is hard to discern because of other damage to the economy, an economist writes.", "CG": "Business Day", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "February 17, 2014", "article": {"section": "Business Day", "tag": "Today's Economist", "published_time": 1392613276, "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/business/index.jsonp", "modified_time": "2014-02-17T15:35:55-05:00"}, "utime": 20140217153555, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20140217, "pdate": 20140217, "des": "Gross Domestic Product;Labor and Jobs;Productivity;Robots and Robotics;United States Economy", "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "Economix Blog", "description": "Job growth has ceased to track productivity growth in recent years, but whether and how technology has been a factor is hard to discern because of other damage to the economy, an economist writes.", "title": "Before Blaming the Robots, Let's Get the Policy Right", "url": "http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/17/before-blaming-the-robots-lets-get-the-policy-right/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/17/before-blaming-the-robots-lets-get-the-policy-right/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "Before Blaming the Robots, Let's Get the Policy Right", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post", "DISPLAYDATE": "February 17, 2014"}, "article_summary": "growth minus productivity growth.\nMy argument regarding the question posed above is simple: Before we can assess the state of technological unemployment, we have to get rid of bad policy-induced unemployment.\nThat is, there are other explanations for the especially weak demand growth in the 2000s.\nPerhaps that maps onto the tech story, with capital equipment replacing workers faster than normal, so that there\u2019s more unemployment, less consumer spending, and weaker output growth.\nAt that point, perhaps we can get a better handle on what the robots are really up to."}
