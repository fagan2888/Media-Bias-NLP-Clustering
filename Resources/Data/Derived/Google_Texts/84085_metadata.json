The forward will have surgery soon and sit out a minimum of three weeks.\n\nIt is another blow to Gallinari, who has had a tough time staying on the court this season. It is his first action back after missing 19 months because of a torn left ACL, which required two surgeries. The most recent injury is not related to the previous one, on the other knee, in any way, the team said.\n\nGallinari played his most effective game this season Saturday night, scoring a team-high 19 points in the Nuggets\u2019 76-73 win over Indiana. The point total was a season high for Gallinari and was the third consecutive game in which he scored in double figures.\n\nAnd in that game, he looked as strong and confident as he had all season, driving repeatedly to the basket to finish shots and draw fouls.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I try to work on,\u201d Gallinari said. \u201cI try to get back to my game, not just being a 3-point shooter, but doing things like going to the basket, getting fouled, going to the free-throw line. And then the 3-pointer is another option. I was able to do it. I was glad I was able to do it, and now I\u2019ve got to do it every game.\u201d\n\nGallinari leaves the Nuggets on a hot streak, averaging 15.0 points per game in his last three. In that stretch, he shot 52 percent from the field, 46.6 percent from the 3-point line and 85.7 percent from the free-throw line. Things were really coming together for him in his new role off the bench.\n\n\u201cAs he starts stringing these games together, it will build his confidence,\u201d Nuggets coach Brian Shaw said after Saturday\u2019s game. \u201cAnd then we\u2019ll see the Gallo that we\u2019ve been accustomed to seeing in the past, and we\u2019ll start winning some of these games that we\u2019re losing and start playing better on a consistent basis.\u201d\n\nBut now, there is a setback.\n\nInjuries have lingered with Gallinari much of this season. His right knee had been bothering him for some time, and it forced him to take some time off a little more than week ago. He pledged to play through the pain and returned to the team Wednesday against Houston to start this run of good games.\n\nIf the Nuggets don\u2019t get Darrell Arthur \u2014 who can play some small forward \u2014 back from a lower left leg injury (and he is questionable for the game), then expect to see more of Alonzo Gee in the rotation.\n\nThe Nuggets are also without center JaVale McGee (leg strain) and shooting guard Randy Foye (quadriceps).\n\nChristopher Dempsey: cdempsey@denverpost.com or twitter.com/dempseypost\n\nDENVER AT CHARLOTTE\n\n5 p.m. Monday, ALT; 950 AM\n\nSpotlight on Kemba Walker: Of late, few point guards in the NBA have been as hot as Kemba Walker to start the season. And because he has doing it for the struggling Hornets, he\u2019s toiling in relative obscurity. In his last seven games, he has averaged 22.6 points, 5.9 assists and 1.7 steals. The former UConn star is shooting 47.6 percent from the field, including a sizzling 48.5 percent from 3-point range.\n\nNOTEBOOK\n\nNuggets: They were swept by Charlotte last season, losing both games, one at home and one on the road. \u201cIt\u2019s still fresh in my mind, even if our guys haven\u2019t remembered that,\u201d said coach Brian Shaw. Added guard Arron Afflalo, \u201cBefore Christmas, we have a decent road trip against some teams that are still trying to compete. Hopefully we take care of those.\u201d\n\nHornets: Lance Stephenson won\u2019t play Monday because of a pelvic sprain. He has already missed two games with the injury. \u2026 No team takes better care of the ball than the Hornets, who average an NBA-low 10.9 turnovers per game this season. They have given up the ball seven or fewer times in nine of their past 16 games.\n\n\n\nChristopher Dempsey, The Denver Post", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Nuggets\u2019 Danilo Gallinari to miss three weeks after knee surgery", "title": "Nuggets\u2019 Danilo Gallinari to miss three weeks after knee surgery", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/12/21/nuggets-danilo-gallinari-to-miss-three-weeks-after-knee-surgery/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141221__2932f8fbfe71d531680f6a706700982cp1.jpg", "height": 479}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141221__2932f8fbfe71d531680f6a706700982cp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-21T11:56:23+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T09:41:02+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Gallinari played his most effective game this season Saturday night, scoring a team-high 19 points in the Nuggets\u2019 76-73 win over Indiana.\nThe point total was a season high for Gallinari and was the third consecutive game in which he scored in double figures.\nIt is another blow to Gallinari, who has had a tough time staying on the court this season.\nThe most recent injury is not related to the previous one, on the other knee, in any way, the team said.\n\u201cAs he starts stringing these games together, it will build his confidence,\u201d Nuggets coach Brian Shaw said after Saturday\u2019s game."}
