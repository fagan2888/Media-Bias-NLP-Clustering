Hardy returns to Miller Park for the first time since he was traded by the Brewers to the Minnesota Twins in exchange for Carlos Gomez in the 2009 offseason. Credit: Reuters\n\nBrewers Blog The Journal Sentinel sports staff brings fans the latest news and inside information on the Brewers SHARE\n\nBy of the\n\nThe Milwaukee Brewers return from their longest road trip of the season \u2013 10 games \u2013 to open a three-game interleague series on this Memorial Day afternoon against the Baltimore Orioles at Miller Park.\n\nThis is Baltimore's first trip to Milwaukee since 2008, and there are some familiar faces on both sides. Orioles shortstop J.J. Hardy returns to Miller Park for the first time since he was traded by the Brewers to the Minnesota Twins in exchange for Carlos Gomez in the 2009 offseason.\n\nBrewers third baseman Mark Reynolds and closer Francisco Rodriguez also played for the Orioles, while Baltimore outfielder Nelson Cruz had a cup of coffee with Milwaukee in 2005.\n\nKyle Lohse takes the mound for Milwaukee, while Chris Tillman goes for Baltimore.\n\nIn addition to the game blog, you can also follow along with a live box score and our Twitter feed.\n\nFIRST INNING\n\n\n\nOrioles \u2013 Adam Jones singles with two outs, but that's it.\n\nBrewers \u2013 Jean Segura continues to flourish in the leadoff spot, rifling a triple into the corner in right. Then on the next pitch, Ryan Braun doubles to right to drive him in for the early 1-0 lead. Braun moves to third on a fly ball to center by Jonathan Lucroy and Carlos Gomez walks, but Mark Reynolds strikes out and Scooter Gennett flies out to center.\n\nSECOND INNING\n\n\n\nOrioles \u2013 J.J. Hardy is welcomed warmly, and he responds with a one-out double into the gap in left-center. Lohse recovers to record the next two outs, though, and keeps Baltimore off the board.\n\nBrewers \u2013 Khris Davis stays hot with a double to right-center. He moves to third on a flyout to right by Lyle Overbay but Lohse strikes out and Jones tracks down a Segura drive into the gap in right-center and the score remains 1-0.\n\nTHIRD INNING\n\n\n\nOrioles \u2013 After striking out Tillman, Lohse is hit hard. Two singles are turned into a pair of runs when Adam Jones triples into the gap in right-center, then a hustle double by Nelson Cruz drives in Jones. Hardy also singles, but it's in between a pair of weird 6-5 putouts as Lohse finally gets out of it trailing, 3-1.\n\nBrewers \u2013 Lucroy draws a one-out walk, moves to third on a Gomez single and scores on a flyout to deep center by Reynolds, who just missed a homer there. Gomez is then thrown out trying to steal second, and the Brewers settle for a 3-2 deficit.\n\nFOURTH INNING\n\n\n\nOrioles \u2013 Jonathan Schoop singles to lead off, but Tillman strikes out and Nick Markakis grounds into a 6-3 double play.\n\nBrewers \u2013 In between Gennett and Lohse strikeouts, Davis and Overbay walk. Segura then drives them both in with a double into the corner in left to put Milwaukee in front once again, 4-3.\n\nFIFTH INNING\n\nOrioles \u2013 Baltimore goes down in order...\n\nBrewers \u2013 ...and so does Milwaukee.\n\nSIXTH INNING\n\n\n\nOrioles \u2013 Lohse records his second straight 1-2-3 inning.\n\nBrewers \u2013 After Gennett leads off with a lineout, Davis smashes a long homer to right-center. Overbay follows up with one of his own into the second deck in right. Lohse strikes out. Ryan Webb replaces Tillman, and Segura flies out to left. Milwaukee now has a 6-3 cushion.\n\nSEVENTH INNING\n\n\n\nOrioles \u2013 Schoop homers to left. Pinch-hitter Steve Clevenger grounds out and Markakis flies out. Lohse is done and Brandon Kintzler comes in and gets Machado to ground out to Segura to end it.\n\nBrewers \u2013 Brad Brach now pitching for Baltimore. Braun taps out to him, Lucroy grounds out and Gomez flies out to left.\n\nEIGHTH INNING\n\n\n\nOrioles \u2013 Kintzler retires the side, thanks to a 5-4-3 double play that ends the frame. Reynolds is having himself a day over at third.\n\nBrewers \u2013 Gennett doubles, Davis singles to reach base for the fourth time and Overbay walks, but Rickie Weeks strikes out as a pinch-hitter and Segura grounds out 6-4 to end the threat.\n\nNINTH INNING\n\n\n\nOrioles \u2013 Francisco Rodriguez now on. He gets the first two outs before Schoop homers to left to pull Baltimore to within 6-5. Pinch-hitter Delmon Young singles to left on the first pitch he sees to bring up Markakis. Machado walks, then Jones flies out to deep center. The Brewers rallied in a similar situation two weeks ago against the Yankees. Let's see if they can do it again.\n\nBrewers \u2013 Darren O'Day now on. Braun lines out to center. Lucroy bloops a single into left to breathe some life into things. Gomez drops down a bunt in front of the plate and Hundley fields it only to throw the ball into right field. The runners move into scoring position, and manager Ron Roenicke replaces Lucroy at third with Elian Herrera. The very next pitch, Reynolds hits a soft liner to shortstop and Herrera is caught about halfway down the line. Easy double play, and the air is out of the balloon here.\n\n10TH INNING\n\n\n\nOrioles \u2013 Rob Wooten comes on and gets the first two outs before J.J. Hardy doubles to left. The ball was in Davis' glove but popped out. Hundley then atones for his earlier miscue by blooping a single to left to score Hardy. Orioles take the lead at 7-6.\n\nBrewers \u2013 Zach Britton now on. With one out, Davis singles to center. Overbay walks. Pinch-hitter Irving Falu, fresh up from Class AAA Nashville, grounds into a 4-3 double play to end it. A deflating loss, to say the least.", "article_metadata": {"title": "Game Blog: Brewers drop a tough one, 7-6, to the Orioles", "og": {"url": "http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/sports/260672271.html", "image": {"width": 2048, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/37372847-reuters_2014-05-22t031808z_36560122_nocid_rtrmadp_3_mlb-bal.jpg", "height": 1351}, "type": "article", "description": "The Milwaukee Brewers return from their longest road trip of the season to open a three-game interleague series on this Memorial Day afternoon against the Baltimore Orioles at Miller Park.", "title": "Game Blog: Brewers drop a tough one, 7-6, to the Orioles"}, "twitter": {"site": "@journalsentinel", "image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/37372847-reuters_2014-05-22t031808z_36560122_nocid_rtrmadp_3_mlb-bal.jpg", "description": "The Milwaukee Brewers return from their longest road trip of the season to open a three-game interleague series on this Memorial Day afternoon against the Baltimore Orioles at Miller Park.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Game Blog: Brewers drop a tough one, 7-6, to the Orioles"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"admins": "journal.sentinel.1", "app_id": 227386193957280}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-mjs-144-icon.png", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcb0a\"", "article_summary": "In addition to the game blog, you can also follow along with a live box score and our Twitter feed.\nWith one out, Davis singles to center.\nSIXTH INNINGOrioles \u2013 Lohse records his second straight 1-2-3 inning.\nSECOND INNINGOrioles \u2013 J.J.
