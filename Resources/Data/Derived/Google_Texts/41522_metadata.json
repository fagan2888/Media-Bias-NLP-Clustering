Regulations on incentives, not yet tested in the courts, went into effect in August 2013.\n\nJason Koski/University Photography\n\nMore than 60 percent of employers have implemented wellness initiatives. But, less than 20 percent of eligible workers participate in wellness interventions like smoking cessation programs. Some employees, particularly those represented by collective bargaining agreements, have begun to push back against intrusive wellness program questions.\n\n\u201cMay I be penalized because I can\u2019t lose weight?\u201d asked Esta Bigler \u201970, director of ILR\u2019s Labor and Employment Law Program, which organized the event. \u201cCan my employer ask me about my plans to have a child in the next year?\u201d\n\nMark E. Brossman \u201975, a partner with Schulte, Roth & Zabel, moderated the discussion. Brossman pointed out that the United States leads industrial world in health care spending at about $2 trillion annually, or 16 percent of the nation\u2019s gross domestic product. \u201cWe are just way off the charts at how much we spend on health care. We don\u2019t spend health care money efficiently,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nWellness initiatives with the highest participation rates include flu shot programs, health fairs, health risk assessments and health screenings.\n\nSome of the ACA-approved rewards for participation include gift cards, reduced health insurance premiums or fitness center discounts. Rewards cannot exceed than 30 percent of the total cost of employee insurance coverage.\n\nSeveral audience members raised concerns about privacy issues and inconsistent application of the penalties levied against those not meeting wellness goals. But panelist Joan Smyth, a partner with Mercer Health & Benefits, said employers receive health risk details as aggregate totals, not on an individualized basis.\n\nFor example, by entering a smoking cessation program or weight loss program, employees can get their insurance premiums lowered. Employers can grant waivers to those with physician\u2019s notes due to a disability, pregnancy or serious illness.\n\nOne audience member asked why mental health or substance abuse isn\u2019t part of such wellness programs if they, too, can increase absenteeism. \u201cWellness programs are targeting risks,\u2019\u2019 Smyth responded. \u201cThe wellness program is about risks.\u201d\n\n\u201cA lot of people in the disability community are opposed to calling it a \u2018wellness program,\u2019 since they are not well,\u201d said panelist Elizabeth Grossman, director of protection and advocacy with Disability Rights New York, and a former regional attorney for the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. \u201cEmployers should have clear defined standards for waiving it,\u201d she said.\n\nTom Kennedy, a partner with Kennedy, Jennik & Murray, said wellness programs are a mandatory subject for collective bargaining. Kennedy said that he doubts a union would object to voluntary blood pressure or cholesterol tests. But, if the tests became a long-term monitoring program and offered a significant monetary reward for participating, \u201ca union may want to be involved in bargaining the terms of the program.\u201d\n\nIf an employer demanded that employees go to the gym twice a month or twice a year, the question becomes on whose time. \u201cVery likely, the union will demand bargaining on that issue,\u201d he said.\n\nKennedy differed with the other panel members on whether some incentives could be labeled \u201ccarrots\u201d and others, like an insurance penalty for smoking, as \u201csticks.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe bargain for carrots,\u2019\u2019 Kennedy said. \u201cWe bargain against sticks. They are not the same thing.\u201d\n\nFor example, an arbitrator upheld a union grievance against the Hershey Co., which charged employees who smoked $25 more per month for health insurance premiums. A federal court agreed that the extra charge was a penalty, not an incentive, so ordered that workers receive a retroactive credit.\n\nJon Craig \u201980 is a journalist based in Westchester County, N.Y.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Cornell Chronicle: Daily news from Cornell University", "viewport": "width=device-width", "description": "Cornell Chronicle: Daily news from Cornell University", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe143d\"", "article_summary": "Wellness programs: well-intentioned or intrusive?\nA panel discussion about the impact of employer-sponsored wellness programs generated lively debate Feb. 28 at the ILR Conference Center in Manhattan.\nWellness initiatives with the highest participation rates include flu shot programs, health fairs, health risk assessments and health screenings.\nSome employees, particularly those represented by collective bargaining agreements, have begun to push back against intrusive wellness program questions.\nTom Kennedy, a partner with Kennedy, Jennik & Murray, said wellness programs are a mandatory subject for collective bargaining."}
