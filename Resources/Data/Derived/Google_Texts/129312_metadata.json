Nathan Deal in March 2013, lost the Republican primary runoff election July 22 to William \u201cBill\u201d Finch.\n\nNo Democrats chose to run for the post in the Nov. 4 General Election, so Finch will begin a four-year term in January.\n\nThe first part of the issue Thursday concerned Gopaul using county postage and stationery for an election for which she had a \u201cmonetary interest.\u201d\n\nThe three-member panel of out-of-county attorneys determined that this was not uncommon for any incumbent, and hadn\u2019t cost Forsyth any additional money as it accompanied the note.\n\nThe second part referred to language on the pamphlet stating that Gopaul was \u201ccertified in and has taught various police officer training classes.\u201d\n\nThe complainant cited a Georgia State Bar rule that prohibits attorneys from using the term specialist unless the source of the title is duly noted.\n\nThe panel determined that part was out of its jurisdiction, since it concerned the state bar, although the members saw no wrongdoing. They also noted that Gopaul couldn\u2019t have taught the classes without the proper training.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.forsythnews.com/archives/25564/", "image": "http://media.morristechnology.com/webmedia/upload/forsythnews/article/2014/09/05/gopaul.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "FORSYTH COUNTY \u2014 The Forsyth County Ethics Board voted 3-0 on Thursday to dismiss a complaint against outgoing Solicitor General Donna Gopaul.", "title": "Ethics complaint against solicitor general dismissed"}, "robots": "noarchive", "title": "Ethics complaint against solicitor general dismissed"}, "article_summary": "FORSYTH COUNTY \u2014 The Forsyth County Ethics Board voted 3-0 on Thursday to dismiss a complaint against outgoing Solicitor General Donna Gopaul.\nThe two-part complaint, filed by William Evelyn Jr., centered on a brochure sent with a thank-you note to the county\u2019s jury pool.\nNo Democrats chose to run for the post in the Nov. 4 General Election, so Finch will begin a four-year term in January.\nThe solicitor general\u2019s office prosecutes misdemeanor criminal cases \u2014 including driving under the influence, simple drug possession and domestic violence \u2014 in the county\u2019s State Court.\nThey also noted that Gopaul couldn\u2019t have taught the classes without the proper training."}
