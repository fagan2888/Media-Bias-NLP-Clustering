People all over the world were trying and are trying to solve still this mystery. \u2026 When we titled [the episode], we said we weren\u2019t going to play games; that we\u2019d give it a title that\u2019s a pretty good clue and we had people going, \u2018You\u2019re going to kill Krusty?!'\u201d\n\nTonight\u2019s episode is called \u201cClown In The Dumps,\u201d leading many to speculate that it would be the beloved Krusty the Clown who would die. Turns out, it was Krusty\u2019s father, Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky, voiced by Jackie Mason.\n\nAlthough Jean claimed he did not want to create a year of hype by providing tantalizing clues, his note about the Emmy win was a serious trip-up for those trying to figure out the identity of the character. Dan Castellaneta voices both Homer and Krusty, and has been honored by the Emmy folks. Those trying to figure out the mystery apparently did not consider guest stars, such as Mason, who have won Emmys for their work on the show.\n\nWhile most were probably thrown off-track by the Emmy clue, Rabbi Krustofsky made Global Grind\u2019s list of plausible theories of who might pass away.\n\nIn an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Jean was asked whether the death would be a disappointment to fans. He was clear he had used the word \u201cbeloved\u201d to describe the character, and not \u201ciconic,\u201d which is what had been repeated.\n\n\u201cHe is beloved. Jackie Mason is wonderful. And he\u2019s still with us. Secondly, we\u2019re not the kind of show that does these really horrific things to its characters. Everybody loves these characters, and I would never kill Krusty. I thought I was never even implying that. But people misinterpreted \u2018Clown in the Dumps,\u2019 and then once I was tied into this craziness, I said, \u2018Okay, I guess we should go with it.\u2019 But the third thing is I think it just works as a sweet show, which is most important. It was something that would be a good exploration of the characters. I thought it\u2019d be good to say, \u2018This is what people think of heaven but it\u2019s not exactly what you\u2019re going to get\u2014it\u2019s more what you do on Earth that matters.\u2019\u2026. If you look back at the clues we gave, everything adds up, so I would find that satisfying. I wouldn\u2019t feel like I was misled.\u2019\n\nIn the Hollywood Reporter conversation, Jean said he has a vision for the series finale, if and when it comes. He hopes to have the Simpsons family getting ready for the Christmas pageant that was the featured event in the series\u2019 first episode, so it is a continuous loop.\n\n\u201cBut I hope I never have to use it!\u201d Jean told THR.\n\nThe Simpsons airs Sunday nights on Fox.\n\n[Image: FOX]", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Simpsons executive producer Al Jean told The Hollywood Reporter that the build-up toward the death of a major character was \"a little over-hyped.\" Jean said", "og": {"site_name": "The Inquisitr News", "description": "The Simpsons executive producer Al Jean told The Hollywood Reporter that the build-up toward the death of a major character was \u201ca little over-hyped.\u201d Jean said", "title": "\u2018The Simpsons\u2019 Spoilers: Executive Producer Explains Character\u2019s Death In Season 26 Premiere", "url": "http://www.inquisitr.com/1506182/the-simpsons-spoilers-executive-producer-explains-characters-death-in-season-26-premiere/", "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/simpsons670409.jpg", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-28T21:57:28+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-28T22:44:35+00:00"}, "type": "article"}, "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/simpsons670409.jpg", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "datePublished": "2014-09-28T21:57:28+00:00", "fb": {"app_id": 164157850314499, "pages": 71179904752}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/0cec37/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "keywords": "clown in the dumps,krusty the clown,krusty the clown father,simpsons character death,simpsons premiere,simpsons producer al jean,simpsons season 26 premiere,tv", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/simpsons670409.jpg", "height": 409, "width": 670}, "site": "@theinquisitr", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The Simpsons executive producer Al Jean told The Hollywood Reporter that the build-up toward the death of a major character was \u201ca little over-hyped.\u201d Jean said"}, "viewport": "width=980"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb1ce\"", "article_summary": "People all over the world were trying and are trying to solve still this mystery.\nIn an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Jean was asked whether the death would be a disappointment to fans.\n'\u201dTonight\u2019s episode is called \u201cClown In The Dumps,\u201d leading many to speculate that it would be the beloved Krusty the Clown who would die.\nDan Castellaneta voices both Homer and Krusty, and has been honored by the Emmy folks.\nSecondly, we\u2019re not the kind of show that does these really horrific things to its characters."}
