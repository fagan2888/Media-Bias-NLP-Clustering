Wichita State and Kansas are going dancing. Both will play in the NCAA tournament's South region.

No. 11 Wichita State vs. No. 11 Vanderbilt, 8:10 p.m. March 15 on TruTV.

After over a week of waiting for answers, the Shockers know their fate: a play-in game Tuesday night vs. Vandy in Dayton, Ohio.

Should the Shockers win, they will travel on to Providence, Rhode Island and No. 6 seed Arizona in the first round Thursday.

No. 1 Kansas vs. No. 16 seed Austin Peay, approx. 3 p.m. March 17 on TNT

As expected, the Kansas Jayhawks are the No. 1 overall seed in the big dance. They are also in the South region but will start their journey in Des Moines, Iowa against No. 16 seed Austin Peay out of the Ohio Valley Conference. Kansas would then face the winner of No. 9 seed UConn/ No. 8 seed Colorado in the second round on Saturday.
