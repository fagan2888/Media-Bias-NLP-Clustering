With multiple balance sheets, hospitals also need to be aware of market exposures within each investment pool, and how investments affect income statements or generate income.\n\nMore efficient construction of investment pools to support an organization's goals \u201cis an important \u2014 often neglected \u2014 part of the asset allocation process,\u201d author Mary Beth Lato, senior asset allocation strategist, wrote in the report.\n\n\u201cYou have to get all the silos of the organization to communicate. It's time consuming, but those who have done it say it is really worthwhile,\u201d said Heather Myers, New York-based managing director for non-profits at Russell Investments, in an interview.\n\nPart of the pressure to pay closer attention to their portfolios is coming from significantly larger regulatory demands, notably the Affordable Care Act. The non-profit health-care sector also is changing, through mergers, takeovers and other competitive strategies.\n\n\u201cMany of those people are feeling more challenges today relative to their peers,\u201d said Ms. Myers.\n\n\u201cHospitals and health-care systems have so many pressures on them in so many ways that the investment pools are often secondary. Many have not had the time to re-evaluate\u201d their portfolios to make sure they are adequately diversified across strategies, she said.\n\nThe full paper is available on Russell's website.", "article_metadata": {"taxonomy": 338, "twitter": {"description": "On top of all the other demands that non-profit hospital and health system executives juggle, enterprise risk management is an important but often overlooked part of constructing investment portfolios that should be added to the list, a research paper from Russell Investments says.", "title": "Enterprise risk management needed in health care, Russell argues", "url": "http://www.pionline.com/article/20150827/ONLINE/150829901/enterprise-risk-management-needed-in-health-care-russell-argues", "image": "http://www.pionline.com/storyimage/CO/20150827/ONLINE/150829901/AR/0/AR-150829901.jpg", "site": "@pensionsnews", "card": "summary"}, "published_at": "2015-08-27T10:42:42-04:00", "guid": "329530F0-A7B5-4096-B62C-E9562108B45F", "short_publish_date": 20150827, "category": "Article", "modified_date": "2016-01-19T16:21:00-05:00", "co_category": "ONLINE", "article-access-level": "metered", "content_title": "Enterprise risk management needed in health care, Russell argues", "author": "Hazel Bradford", "co_currcategory": "ONLINE", "access_level": "metered", "theme": "INVESTING+PORTFOLIO STRATEGIES", "co_current_request": "/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20150827/ONLINE/150829901/enterprise-risk-management-needed-in-health-care-russell-argues", "article-theme": "Investing/portfolio Strategies", "image": "http://www.pionline.com/storyimage/CO/20150827/ONLINE/150829901/AR/0/AR-150829901.jpg&imageversion=thumbnail", "description": "On top of all the other demands that non-profit hospital and health system executives juggle, enterprise risk management is an important but often overlooked part of constructing investment portfolios that should be added to the list, a research paper from Russell Investments says.", "related_links": "manual", "article": {"section": "Investing/portfolio Strategies", "published_time": "2015-08-27T10:42:42-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-19T16:21:00-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=1024", "og": {"site_name": "Pensions & Investments", "description": "On top of all the other demands that non-profit hospital and health system executives juggle, enterprise risk management is an important but often overlooked part of constructing investment portfolios that should be added to the list, a research paper from Russell Investments says.", "title": "Enterprise risk management needed in health care, Russell argues", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.pionline.com/storyimage/CO/20150827/ONLINE/150829901/AR/0/AR-150829901.jpg", "url": "http://www.pionline.com/article/20150827/ONLINE/150829901/enterprise-risk-management-needed-in-health-care-russell-argues", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=666127269, app-argument=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/p-i-news/id666127269?mt=8", "title": "Enterprise risk management needed in health care, Russell argues", "summary": "On top of all the other demands that non-profit hospital and health system executives juggle, enterprise risk management is an important but often overlooked part of constructing investment portfolios that should be added to the list, a research paper from Russell Investments says.", "co_current_request_unmodified": "/article/20150827/ONLINE/150829901/enterprise-risk-management-needed-in-health-care-russell-argues", "url": "http://www.pionline.com/article/20150827/ONLINE/150829901/enterprise-risk-management-needed-in-health-care-russell-argues", "publish_date": "2015-08-27T10:42:42-04:00"}, "article_summary": "The paper offers a framework for evaluating asset allocation decisions across three key considerations: investment portfolio risk tolerance, portfolio construction and portfolio implementation.\n\u201cHospitals and health-care systems have so many pressures on them in so many ways that the investment pools are often secondary.\nPaying closer attention to goals and exposures throughout an organization can lead to a more effective asset allocation for its multiple asset pools, the paper argued.\nMore efficient construction of investment pools to support an organization's goals \u201cis an important \u2014 often neglected \u2014 part of the asset allocation process,\u201d author Mary Beth Lato, senior asset allocation strategist, wrote in the report.\nRussell defines enterprise as all aspects of an organization, including operations, governance and finance, plus external factors such as capital projects or acquisitions."}
