Last spring, the University of North Carolina Wilmington’s Department of Theatre took on the 19th-century French writer Alfred Jarry’s absurdist play “Ubu Roi.”

This weekend and next, the theater department will go even further back in the history of French comedies with 17th century writer Molière’s satirical farce “The Doctor in Spite of Himself,” which opens Sept. 25 As with “Ubu Roi,” which was directed by Ed Wagenseller, “Doctor,” which is to be directed by Dr. Anne Berkeley, will use a translation of the play that’s geared toward a modern audience.

On the surface, there seems to be plenty in “The Doctor in Spite of Himself,” which satirizes the medical profession, that remains relevant in today’s world of Obamacare and HMOs.

In the play, Sgnarelle (Bruno Rose) is tricked by his wife, Martinne (Arianna Tysinger), into impersonating a doctor, even though, as a common woodcutter, he knows nothing about medicine. Sgnarelle is a character that Molière, who was also an actor, played in various plays that he wrote, and the stock character of the deceived, buffoonish husband is one that comes from the Italian comic style of commedia d’ell arte, which was heavily influential on Molière’s work.

According to a press release, Dr. Berkeley’s “Doctor” will focus largely on the physical comedy and bawdiness that commedia d’ell arte is known for. The theater department’s new chair, Thomas Salzman, will serve as lighting designer for “The Doctor in Spite of Himself.”
