Eliot Engel (N.Y.), the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee.\n\nEngle's comments were meant to argue that the last best way to halt Iran\u2019s nuclear progress is through an agreement.\n\n\u201cAt this point we all know the refrain: no deal is better than a bad deal,\u201d he said during a House hearing on the still-in-the-works deal. \u201cThe alternative to a deal would surely mean some kind of military strikes on Iran\u2019s nuclear plant.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just accepting the deal or nothing,\u201d he added. \u201cThere are things we\u2019re going to have to come to grips with, and I believe one of them is bombing the nuclear reactor.\u201d\n\nThe comments from Engel \u2014 who has cautiously viewed the Obama administration\u2019s plans for a deal \u2014 increase the stakes for U.S. negotiators, who appear to be closing in on the final terms of a deal. They also speak volumes about the few choices facing congressional lawmakers, who will have the opportunity to weigh in on the deal if one is reached in coming days.\n\nDuring a separate hearing on Capitol Hill on Thursday, President Obama\u2019s choice to be the next chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Joseph Dunford, told lawmakers that the U.S. would have the ability to destroy Iran\u2019s nuclear program, if it so chose.\n\nBut that would only be temporarily, Engel maintained.\n\n\u201cIf we are able to sustain the sanctions regime and have a bombing of their plant that sets them back two years or three years, is that really a viable alternative?\u201d he asked.\n\nLawmakers in Congress will be able to block the terms of the deal, assuming one is reached. But widespread skepticism in both parties could pose a hurdle to the Obama administration, which is negotiating the deal along with five other nations and Iran.\n\nSecretary of State John Kerry is expected to give an update on the talks from Vienna later on Thursday.\n\nIn the wake of diplomatic breakthroughs, the U.S. has previously taken action to destroy Iranian nuclear infrastructure, with the hopes of forestalling its ability to create a bomb.\n\nThe Stuxnet computer worm was reportedly developed by U.S. and Israeli officials, and managed to destroy roughly one-fifth of Iran\u2019s nuclear centrifuges by the time it was discovered five years ago.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "\u201cThe alternative to a deal would surely mean some kind of military strikes on Iran\u2019s nuclear plant.\u201d", "description": "\u201cThe alternative to a deal would surely mean some kind of military strikes on Iran\u2019s nuclear plant.\u201d", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Julian Hattem", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "\u201cThe alternative to a deal would surely mean some kind of military strikes on Iran\u2019s nuclear plant.\u201d", "title": "Top Dem: Only alternative to Iran deal is bombing campaign", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/247367-key-dem-only-alternative-to-iran-deal-is-bombing-campaign", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/iranmilitaryparade04202015getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-07-09T13:08:31-04:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2015-07-09T13:08-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/247367-key-dem-only-alternative-to-iran-deal-is-bombing-campaign", "dcterms.date": "2015-07-09T11:38-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Julian Hattem", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Iran, Nuclear program of Iran,Eliot Engel,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-09T11:38:02-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-09T13:08:31-04:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/247367-key-dem-only-alternative-to-iran-deal-is-bombing-campaign", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "\u201cThe alternative to a deal would surely mean some kind of military strikes on Iran\u2019s nuclear plant.\u201d", "card": "summary", "title": "Top Dem: Only alternative to Iran deal is bombing campaign"}, "dcterms.title": "Top Dem: Only alternative to Iran deal is bombing campaign"}, "article_summary": "Engle's comments were meant to argue that the last best way to halt Iran\u2019s nuclear progress is through an agreement.\n\u201cThe alternative to a deal would surely mean some kind of military strikes on Iran\u2019s nuclear plant.\u201dADVERTISEMENT\u201cIt\u2019s not just accepting the deal or nothing,\u201d he added.\n\u201cAt this point we all know the refrain: no deal is better than a bad deal,\u201d he said during a House hearing on the still-in-the-works deal.\nThe only real alternative to ongoing negotiations to limit Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions is to bomb its facilities, according to a top House Democrat.\nLawmakers in Congress will be able to block the terms of the deal, assuming one is reached."}
