Despite this, Olympus issued no safety alerts or guidance to hospitals and physicians in the United States until February 2015 \u2013 almost three years after first realizing the problem in April 2012.\"\n\nThe \"superbug\" kills almost half of those infected, Murray said.\n\n\"Although we do not agree with all of the report's conclusions, we are closely reviewing the recommendations in the report as part of Olympus' ongoing efforts to increase patient safety associated with use of Olympus duodenoscopes,\" said Mark A. Miller, vice president of Corporate and Medical Communications for Olympus Corporation of the Americas.\n\nOlympus cooperated with the committee, and the report demonstrates a shared responsibility with duodenoscope manufacturers, hospitals, manufacturers of automated endoscope reprocessors, and the Food and Drug Administration, he said.\n\nThe report found that an estimated 20 U.S. hospitals traced antibiotic-resistant infections directly to the devices, but did not proactively communicate information to federal agencies.\n\nThe hospitals reporting the greatest number of incidents include New York-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center in New York City, with 15 patients infected; UMass Memorial Medical Center in Worcester, Mass., with 20 patients infected; Advocate Lutheran General Hospital in Park Ridge, Illinois, with 32 patients infected; Virginia Mason Hospital and Medical Center in Seattle, Washington, with 32 patients infected; and Carolinas Medical Center in Charlotte, North Carolina, with 18 patients infected.\n\n\"Overall, hospitals' slow approach left the FDA with an inaccurate picture of the frequency and severity of these events,\" the report states. \"\u2026 Hospitals as a whole appear to have believed they had an obligation to report only what they could demonstrate beyond any doubt. Such narrow reasoning reveals a misunderstanding about hospital reporting requirements, which are triggered by information that reasonably suggests a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury.\"\n\nThe FDA was also not spared in the report, which said the agency failed to recognize the prevalence of duodenoscope-linked infections and to respond quickly.\n\nThe report's recommendations included: having Congress require and promote that unique device identifiers be included in insurance claims, electronic health records and device registries; that the FDA should evaluate whether modifications to the design of the closed-channel duodenoscopes are necessary; and that the FDA should move faster to provide information to healthcare providers.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/olympus-recalls-scopes-after-senate-report-says-company-knew-infection-dangers", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/VirginiaMason.jpg", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "Two days after a Senate committee released a report stating the manufacturer of 85 percent of endoscopes used in the United States knew the hard-to-clean reusable devices caused superbug infections, scope-maker Olympus issued a recall of the medical equipment.", "title": "Olympus recalls scopes after Senate report says company knew of infection dangers"}, "twitter": {"site": "@HC_Finance", "image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/VirginiaMason.jpg"}, "description": "Two days after a Senate committee released a report stating the manufacturer of 85 percent of endoscopes used in the United States knew the hard-to-clean reusable devices caused superbug infections, scope-maker Olympus issued a recall of the medical equipment.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Olympus recalls scopes after Senate report says company knew of infection dangers"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Two days after a Senate committee released a report stating the manufacturer of 85 percent of endoscopes used in the United States knew the hard-to-clean reusable devices caused superbug infections, scope-maker Olympus issued a recall of the medical equipment.&#13; The duodenoscopes made by Olympus, Pentax and Fujifilm Medical Systems were linked to at least 25 incidents of antibiotic-resistant infections that sickened an estimated 250 patients worldwide, according to the Jan. 13 report by the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions.", "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "The Senate report found that Olympus knew by May 2012 that the duodenoscope model used at Virginia Mason could harbor and spread bacteria even after proper cleaning.\nThe report found that an estimated 20 U.S. hospitals traced antibiotic-resistant infections directly to the devices, but did not proactively communicate information to federal agencies.\nThe FDA was also not spared in the report, which said the agency failed to recognize the prevalence of duodenoscope-linked infections and to respond quickly.\nPhoto by Virginia Mason HospitalTwo days after a Senate committee released a report stating the manufacturer of 85 percent of endoscopes used in the United States knew the hard-to-clean reusable devices caused superbug infections, scope-maker Olympus issued a recall of the medical equipment.\n\"\u2026 Hospitals as a whole appear to have believed they had an obligation to report only what they could demonstrate beyond any doubt."}
