It is a central website, healthcare.gov, where Americans can shop for private health insurance and qualify for federal subsidies based on income.\n\nIf another insurer does not join the marketplace, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas will be the only option for Kansans, though they will be able to choose from multiple Blue Cross plans.\n\nUnitedHealthcare announced last week it will withdraw from most of the 34 states where it sells marketplace health insurance after losing $475 million last year. This was the first year the company has insured Kansans through the marketplace.\n\n\u201cThey announced they wish they had waited a little bit longer before getting in,\u201d Shultz says. \u201cI think they got into a lot of markets and sustained some fairly heavy losses and then regretted getting in, so they just decided to change their course.\u201d\n\nCoventry pulled out of the Kansas marketplace last year.\n\nSheldon Weisgrau is the director of an ACA consumer education program at the Kansas Association for the Medically Underserved. He says it\u2019s difficult to know at this point the effect of UnitedHealthcare\u2019s withdrawal.\n\nWeisgrau says Blue Cross already dominates the Kansas marketplace, insuring about 80 percent of the 101,555 Kansans who purchased plans during 2016 open enrollment.\n\nThe 20 percent of those Kansans insured by UnitedHealthcare won\u2019t be able to auto-renew their marketplace policies next year and will have to go back to the website and shop again. But Weisgrau says all Kansans who buy health insurance on the marketplace should do that anyway to get the best deal.\n\nInsurers still are trying to feel out the costs and benefits of selling on the marketplace, he says. As that process becomes more precise, and the pent-up medical needs of previously uninsured customers trends down, the \u201ccaptive audience\u201d of healthcare.gov shoppers will become more enticing.\n\n\u201cIn the end, it\u2019s probably better for consumers to have more choices of more insurers, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s at all a failure of the marketplace if there\u2019s only one insurance company that\u2019s offering plans (next year),\u201d Weisgrau says. \u201cIt\u2019s still very early in the game, and this is going to shake out over several years.\u201d\n\nWeisgrau says it\u2019s too soon to tell if having only one insurer in the marketplace would increase premiums.\n\nShultz says he did not foresee that happening because Blue Cross has \u201cbeen a very good player\u201d that is \u201cvery interested in insuring Kansans.\u201d\n\n\u201cTheir rates for 2017 are going to be based on what has happened in the past for them,\u201d Shultz says. \u201cIn other words, I don\u2019t see that, \u2018Well, we\u2019re the only player, so now we can hike our rates.\u2019 I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll do that.\u201d\n\nShultz says if two or three additional insurance companies join the marketplace, they might bring with them lower premium options, especially after the Legislature passed a bill allowing insurers to sell plans that only reimburse for in-network care.\n\nSelzer is working to create those kinds of options, he says.\n\n\u201cThe commissioner, when he ran for office in 2014, it was on a plank of getting other companies to sell products within the state \u2014 not only health, but auto and life policies as well,\u201d Shultz says. \u201cThis has been a continuous project for Commissioner Selzer. Obviously when you have a company pull out, that makes it a little more pressing. But from day one, that\u2019s what he\u2019s been about.\u201d\n\nAndy Marso is a reporter for KHI News Service in Topeka, a partner in the Heartland Health Monitor team.
