A number of recent studies have shown that environmental knowledge embedded in indigenous names, oral traditions and taxonomies is often lost when a community shifts to another language.\u201d\n\nAlong with these inherent values, another reason for starting the program was to try and stop the loss of these languages, including the native languages of the western hemisphere. UNESCO estimated that without intervention, half of 6,000 plus languages that exist today would disappear by the end of the century.\n\nIn the United States, according to UNESCO\u2019s Atlas of the World\u2019s Languages in Danger, there are 191 indigenous languages that face this problem.
