A bicyclist died after he was struck by a driver who was trying to avoid a collision with a truck pulling a boat in Fort Collins on Saturday.

Police do not believe the driver, Earl Ong, 18, was drunk or distracted, but are investigating the possibility that he fell asleep at the wheel, according to a Fort Collins police release.

The cyclist, who hasnâ€™t been identified, died at the Medical Center of the Rockies.

The accident happened at about 2:54 p.m. Ong, of Fort Collins, was driving a 2001 Dodge Durango north on Lemay Avenue when he realized he was about to collide with a truck pulling a boat that was in front of him.

He swerved to the right to avoid the boat trailer and hit the cyclist who was riding north in the bike lane.

Charges are pending in the case.

Anyone with information about the collision can contact Officer Drew Jurkofsky at 970-416-2224.
