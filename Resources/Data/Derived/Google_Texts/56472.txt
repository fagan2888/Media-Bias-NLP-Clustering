An initiative run by the American College Health Association, Healthy Campus 2020 — which promotes health on college campuses — recently unveiled a new wellness initiative at Oakwood University in Alabama, a historically black college affiliated with the Seventh Day Adventist Church.

Oakwood students will now be evaluated on a number of traditional biomedical indices, such as blood pressure and hemoglobin, as well as their "spiritual health," "mental/emotional health" and the amount of rest they are getting. The results of these evaluations will be available to them on a transcript they can track throughout their college career.
