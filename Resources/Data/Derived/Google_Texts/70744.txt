Technically Incorrect offers a slightly twisted take on the tech that's taken over our lives.

Blue Origin

Is the Earth a big enough place for some as huge as Donald Trump?

Might there be planets up above, or at least out there, that will fully appreciate his joie de vivre and embrace of all peoples?

This thought first invaded me some time ago. Now, though, it's been sharpened by the words of Jeff Bezos.

The Amazon CEO wasn't one to tweet before a couple of weeks ago. But he offered a particularly pointed blast on Monday.

It read: "Finally trashed by @realDonaldTrump. Will still reserve him a seat on the Blue Origin rocket." This was accompanied by the hashtag #sendDonaldtospace.

Blue Origin is Bezos' company that just successfully launched and returned to earth a reusable rocket.

You might wonder, though, what had suddenly moved Bezos to this generous, but perhaps barbed, offer. I fancy it was Trump himself.

Earlier on Monday Big Don sent out several tweets deriding Bezos and his company. Sample: "If @amazon ever had to pay fair taxes, its stock would crash and it would crumble like a paper bag. The @washingtonpost scam is saving it!"

Sadly, there was no hashtag #amascam. I fear Trump missed out there.

In turn, because I can feel you spinning, you'll wonder what Trump has suddenly got against Bezos.

It might have been this somewhat mocking piece published by the Washington Post, which Bezos bought in 2013. This suggested that, on the subject of Trump predicting Osama Bin Laden's impact on the world, Trump and facts were somewhat estranged.

Neither Amazon nor Trump's campaign immediately responded to requests for comment.

I worry too, though, about Trump's grasp of certain facts. In one of his raging tweets, he declared that Amazon was a "no profit company." This is a touch strange, given that in July it insisted it made $92 million.

Perhaps, though, for a billionaire of Trump's well, enormity, $92 million is indeed nothing.
