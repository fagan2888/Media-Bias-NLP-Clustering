The measure also would require extensive reporting on IRS spending.\n\n\u201cIn addition, our bill reduces funding for agencies that we believe can produce results with fewer dollars,\" said Ander Crenshaw (R-Fla.), chairman of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Financial Services.\n\n\"And, where there is a history of inappropriate behavior, such as the Internal Revenue Service, cutbacks and reforms are recommended to hold them accountable,\u201d Crenshaw said.\n\nFor other agencies, the measure provides $1.5 billion for the SEC, which is $50 million below the fiscal year 2016 enacted level and $226 million below the president\u2019s request.\n\nThe measure would shift funding for Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to the annual congressional appropriations process instead of receiving direct funding from the Federal Reserve, a move congressional Republicans have pushed for since the agency was created.\n\nThe measure also calls for the CFPB to create a five-member commission to take the place of the single director, another issue that Republicans have pushed in recent years.\n\nThe bill also would:\n\n\u2022 Provide $200 million for construction of a new Federal Bureau of Investigation headquarters.\n\n\u2022 Provide $7 billion for the federal courts, an increase of $177 million above the fiscal year 2016 enacted level.\n\n\u2022 The bill contains $883 million for the Small Business Administration.\n\n\u2022 The legislation provides funding above the president\u2019s request for Small Business Development Centers ($125 million), State Trade and Export Promotion ($20 million) and Women\u2019s Business Centers ($19 million).\n\n\u2022 The General Services Administration (GSA) gets $9.2 billion out of the Federal Buildings Fund, a reduction of $951 million below the fiscal year 2016 enacted level.\n\n\u2022 The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) would receive $315 million, a cut of $69 million below last year's level. The legislation prohibits the FCC from implementing the net neutrality order until certain court cases are resolved.\n\n\u2022 The bill contains a $725 million federal payment to the District of Columbia, which is $4.6 million below the fiscal 2016 enacted level and $38 million below the request. The measure includes $45 million for the Scholarships for Opportunity and Results Act (SOAR), which provides scholarships to low-income students in DC to attend private schools and reauthorizes the program through 2021.\n\nIn addition, the legislation keeps provisions prohibiting federal and local funds from being used for abortion or to further marijuana legalization and it maintains a prohibition on federal funds from being used for needle exchanges.\n\n\u2022 The measure provides one-time funding increases for the presidential transition for the Executive Office of the President ($7.6 million), General Services Administration ($9.5 million), National Archives and Records Administration ($4.9 million) and federal payment for Emergency Planning and Security in the District of Columbia ($25 million).\n\nUpdated at 6:15 p.m.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The fnancial services measure provides $10.9 billion for the IRS, a cut of $236 million below last year's level.", "description": "The fnancial services measure provides $10.9 billion for the IRS, a cut of $236 million below last year's level.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Vicki Needham", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The fnancial services measure provides $10.9 billion for the IRS, a cut of $236 million below last year's level.", "title": "House bill cuts IRS funding", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/finance/appropriations/281052-house-bill-cuts-irs-funding", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/irs_080515getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-05-24T18:19:08-04:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-05-24T18:19-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/finance/appropriations/281052-house-bill-cuts-irs-funding", "dcterms.date": "2016-05-24T12:36-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Vicki Needham", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Internal Revenue Service, IRS targeting controversy, Hal Rogers, Ander Crenshaw, Sander Levin,Jack Lew,", "article": {"published_time": "2016-05-24T12:36:18-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-24T18:19:08-04:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/finance/appropriations/281052-house-bill-cuts-irs-funding", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The fnancial services measure provides $10.9 billion for the IRS, a cut of $236 million below last year's level.", "card": "summary", "title": "House bill cuts IRS funding"}, "dcterms.title": "House bill cuts IRS funding"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd77ed\"", "article_summary": "The House Appropriations Committee on Tuesday released legislation that cuts overall funding to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) while maintaining spending levels aimed at improving the agency's customer service.\nThe bill provides annual funding for the Treasury Department, the Judiciary, the Small Business Administration, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and other related agencies.\n\u201cIn addition, our bill reduces funding for agencies that we believe can produce results with fewer dollars,\" said Ander Crenshaw (R-Fla.), chairman of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Financial Services.\n\u201cWe should restore the IRS\u2019s funding, not continue to cut it.\u201dFor the IRS, the bill would prohibit bonuses, production of inappropriate videos and conferences and funds for the White House to order the IRS to determine the tax-exempt status of an organization.\n\u2022 The legislation provides funding above the president\u2019s request for Small Business Development Centers ($125 million), State Trade and Export Promotion ($20 million) and Women\u2019s Business Centers ($19 million)."}
