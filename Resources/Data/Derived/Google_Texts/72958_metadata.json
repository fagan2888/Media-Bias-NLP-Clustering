This new standard would upend the wildly successful franchise system that has allowed millions of Americans\u2014especially minorities\u2014to pursue the American Dream.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nAs Job Creators Network has explained in the past, joint employer means that franchisors such as McDonald\u2019s, Burger King and Papa John\u2019s could be liable for labor violations at local franchises\u2014even though they are separate, individually-owned businesses. Franchisees pay for the right to run their small business as they choose, decide who to hire, how much to pay, and what benefits to offer employees. Franchisors have virtually no role in franchisees\u2019 daily operations. Yet the NLRB is trying to define them as joint employers.\n\nThe franchise model has worked for decades. Franchisees get the freedom and independence to run their own business where and how they want; franchisors get to see their brand and business model expand around the country. The numbers tell the story: Franchising has created about 770,000 small businesses, supported 18 million jobs, and has added more than $2 trillion to the American economy.\n\nBut the NLRB\u2019s new joint employer rule would blur the lines between big and small business. The joint employer standard provides a clear incentive for franchisors to scale back on franchisees as a way of avoiding commercial headaches and legal migraines. And the franchisee, who essentially works for the franchisor under the new standard, may think twice before signing any franchising deal.\n\nThis is especially harmful for America\u2019s minority neighborhoods. Minorities make up 20 percent of all franchise ownership, who often locate in minority communities and employ those who live nearby. Many minority job-seekers rely on franchisees for entry-level work \u2013 a lifeline in communities facing double-digit unemployment. But joint employer status makes it more difficult for minority franchisees, some of whom spend their life savings on a chance at entrepreneurship, to set up shop and become a job creator.\n\nWhy \u201cfix\u201d what isn\u2019t broken? The NLRB\u2019s regulatory impulse encroaches on working America for no perceivable benefit.\n\nJob creators had hoped the omnibus bill would address the NLRB\u2019s overreach in redefining the definition of joint employer and bring relief to job creators. But by the look of things, Congress has become a willing accomplice.\n\nAlfredo Ortiz is CEO and President of Job Creators Network.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The omnibus bill missed a chance to help job creators.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "The omnibus bill missed a chance to help job creators.", "title": "Omnibus Spending Bill Fails Job Creators - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/06/McDonalds-US-flag-ap.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/12/19/omnibus-spending-bill-fails-job-creators/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The omnibus bill missed a chance to help job creators.", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/06/McDonalds-US-flag-ap.jpg", "title": "Omnibus Spending Bill Fails Job Creators - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": ",Big Government,omnibus", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "published_time": "2015-12-19T06:08:14-07:00", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf318\"", "article_summary": "Job creators had hoped the omnibus bill would address the NLRB\u2019s overreach in redefining the definition of joint employer and bring relief to job creators.\nAlfredo Ortiz is CEO and President of Job Creators Network.\nBut the NLRB\u2019s new joint employer rule would blur the lines between big and small business.\nThe joint employer standard provides a clear incentive for franchisors to scale back on franchisees as a way of avoiding commercial headaches and legal migraines.\nFranchisees pay for the right to run their small business as they choose, decide who to hire, how much to pay, and what benefits to offer employees."}
