We have not found a single model that fits D2C.\u201d\n\nHe sees telemedicine as a promising area, particularly Doctor on Demand \u2014 a business co-founded by Phil McGraw, aka. Doctor Phil. It charges $40 for a virtual visit. He also flagged up Oscar, a health insurance startup with the ambitious goal of making the industry more efficient.\n\nBut, as Mittendorff pointed out, there\u2019s plenty of low-hanging fruit \u2013 like knowing which of their members is alive or dead. That is something payers have struggled with.\n\nOn the subject of concierge care, particularly on-demand house calls,\n\nMittendorff was not so enthusiastic.\n\n\u201cThe economics of urgent care on demand are very hard to work, but the big problem is filling the time of providers which, by the way, are not used to driving to patients\u2019 houses.\u201d\n\nHe pointed to big box drugstore chains \u2013 Walmart,Walgreens and CVS \u2013 as areas to watch. another hot area. He reminded the audience of Walmart\u2019s aspirations to be the biggest primary care provider in the U.S. The idea is they will charge $4-$8 for employees and $40 for non employees.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m interested in what\u2019s happening with Apple and Google coming into digital health. It\u2019s a fascinating moment in consumer capture right now,\u201d Papanek said. \u201cThe consumer has already chosen the engagement channel \u2014mobile phones, but [the challenges is] figuring out the best moment to capture the consumer. Is it when they get hit with a big doctor\u2019s bill? When they want to lose weight? But they have to get smarter about search and profiling.\u201d\n\nStill, Papanek added that she has seen several companies providing an Uber-style prescription medicine home delivery service. Each of them has under $2 million in revenue. \u201cI have no idea how to pick a winner in that race.\u201d\n\nOne area that has seen a lot of activity is with lowering healthcare costs for self-insured employers with the idea of improving employees health. Fleshman said he was \u201ca bit leery\u201d of this area because it\u2019s tough to get leverage. \u201cInsurers are an easier sell.\u201d\n\nBut maybe it just depends on the kind of self-insured employer. Papanek said, \u201cWhat\u2019s interesting is a self-insured employer that is also a provider. There\u2019s a lot of early stage adoption by health systems hoping to learn and they\u2019re actually doing this with their own lives under management.\u201d\n\nFleshman observed that if they were having this panel discussion five years earlier, \u201cwe would be talking about quantified self.\u201d But with the adoption of the Affordable Care Act and the HITECH Act, \u201cwe\u2019re talking about companies connecting to the healthcare ecosystem.\u201d Digital therapeutics with the potential to change behavior \u2014 such as diet, sleep and exercise in conjunction with other therapies are pervasive.\n\nThe IPOs for digital health companies this year have been few and very different from each other. The panelists agreed that you can\u2019t compare a big wearables company with a huge number of consumer customers to Evolent Health, a high-priced software companies that only has a handful of accounts \u2014 albeit sizeable ones.\n\nTeladoc has some growing to do, said Fleshman. Although telemedicine by phone and email has been around for years, the most recent stage of its evolution is still taking shape.", "article_metadata": {"description": "But don't get too excited about on-demand house calls.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "MedCity News", "description": "But don't get too excited about on-demand house calls.", "title": "Digital health investment is thriving but business models still evolving", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://medcitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/vc-panel-stanford-medx.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-09-28T12:08:10-04:00", "url": "http://medcitynews.com/2015/09/digital-health-investment-is-thriving-but-business-models-still-evolving/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://medcitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/vc-panel-stanford-medx.jpg", "description": "But don't get too excited about on-demand house calls.", "card": "summary", "title": "Digital health investment is thriving but business models still evolving - MedCity News"}, "fb": {"app_id": 148725768475669}, "google-site-verification": "xudQg7nxVR9ifmMTY4Tf-0wVtX9b6rWLQd0utCweGOc", "keywords": "weight loss, obesity, overweight,diabetes,massachusetts,medical devices,obesity,startups,healthcare innovation, medcity news,medcity news,san francisco, startups, life sciences,accelerator,rock health,startup advice,startup funding,patient monitoring system, motion sensors ,dc,healthcare it,washington,foodborne pathogens, diagnostics company, diagnostic platforms,minimally invasive surgery, laser surgery,cambridge,dealflow,hospitals,wellpoint, healthways, health and wellness, employee wellness programs,investing,wellness,medtronic, shanghai innovation center, china, r&d,china,mdt,minneapolis,minnesota,publics,twin cities,ulcerative colitis, abbott labs, humira,abbott labs,doctors,pharmaceuticals,skin disorders, pharmaceuticals, md anderson cancer center,cancer,texas,renal denervation, st. jude medical,st. jude medical,stj,emr, ehr, electronic health records, electronic medical records, certified emr,certified emr,ehr,electronic health records,electronic medical records,advanced cellular technology,amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,embryonic stem cells,geron corporation,lou gehrig\\'s disease,macular degeneration,regenerative medicine,spinal cord damage,value-based healthcare system, obamacare, fee-for-service model,california,cleveland,health insurance,insurance,ohio,pennsylvania,politics,cancer treatment options library, aetna, aet, healthcare it,aet,aetna,health it,phi,philadelphia,Asset Management Ventures, California, canaan partners, events, Medx, Norwest Partners, Silicon Valley, , MedCity News", "article": {"section": "Convergence", "tag": "Silicon Valley", "published_time": "2015-09-28T11:57:27-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-28T12:08:10-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,width=device-width,user-scalable=no,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd05fa\"", "article_summary": "Fitbit\u2019s monster IPO has fueled interest in digital health investment, and speculation over which business models will succeed in a market that continues to evolve.\nThe IPOs for digital health companies this year have been few and very different from each other.\n\u201cI\u2019m interested in what\u2019s happening with Apple and Google coming into digital health.\nAdvertisementMittendorff said that although direct to consumer is a huge part of the equation, it comes with a very different set of incentives than the business to business models that dominate the digital health sector.\nHe also flagged up Oscar, a health insurance startup with the ambitious goal of making the industry more efficient."}
