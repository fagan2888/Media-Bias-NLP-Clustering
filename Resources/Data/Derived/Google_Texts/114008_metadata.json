One minute he was sleeping peacefully in a bedroom. Fifteen minutes later he was nowhere to be found.\n\nThough it happened during a period of time when many people are normally scrambling to get to work or to run errands, no one at the Lakewood apartment complex near West Sixth Avenue and West Wadsworth Boulevard would report seeing the tyke wandering around unaccompanied by an adult.\n\nThe 18-year-old mother of two awoke around 8:30 a.m. that Monday morning, June 12, 1989. Jessica had been sleeping on the floor in the apartment\u2019s living room.\n\nShe walked into a bedroom where her 23-month-old son Anthony had been put to bed the night before.\n\nAnthony was still sleeping.\n\nJessica said she went back to sleep in the front room for another 15 minutes, woke and discovered the boy was gone.\n\nThe apartment door was open.\n\n\u201cI got scared,\u201d Moya later said. \u201cI looked all over \u2013 in the cupboards, in the closets and under the bed. I looked everywhere.\u201d\n\nShe ran outside and looked in the apartment pool.\n\nShe ran around the grounds of the apartment complex.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "9/11,Anthony Moya,Bancroft Fire Department,Capt.
