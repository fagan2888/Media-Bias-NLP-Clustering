Police arrested a nightclub manager Saturday night after discovering the club had more than doubled its maximum capacity.

Police were called to the Candy Nightclub located at 323 E. Sheridan Avenue in Bricktown's Entertainment District on Saturday, January 11 to check the capacity. According to a police report, several clubs in the Bricktown area have had overcrowding issues. This was the third time in less than a month that police say Candy Nightclub more than maxed its capacity.

When officers arrived at the club around 1:50 a.m. Sunday, they couldn't even make it past the entryway due to the number of people inside, the report states. Officers said it was shoulder to shoulder inside the club. The employee working the door told officers there were 212 people inside the club at the time.

However, police conducted their own count. With one officer monitoring the back door, officers use an "accusplit" counter to count each person as they left the club. The officer determined there had actually been 663 club patrons inside. The maximum capacity for Candy Nightclub is 280.

Police arrested the club's manager, Corey Ellen Travis, 30, for failure to prevent overcrowding. Travis signed a citatation and was released at the scene.
