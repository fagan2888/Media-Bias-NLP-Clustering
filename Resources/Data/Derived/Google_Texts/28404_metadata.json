Ram\u00edrez, who was ousted as editor of El Mundo, the conservative newspaper he founded 25 years ago.\n\nBut rather than blaming his dismissal on the newspaper\u2019s financial losses, Mr. Ram\u00edrez accused Spain\u2019s government of engineering retribution for El Mundo\u2019s recent reporting on a series of corruption cases, one of which involved Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy.\n\n\u201cThis is a show of force by a government that wants to send a message, not just to El Mundo, but to the whole media sector, that whoever acts in a way that the government sees as inconvenient will pay the consequences,\u201d Mr. Ram\u00edrez said in a phone interview Saturday. \u201cWhat is happening under Rajoy is particularly serious because it\u2019s about using a time of clear economic weakness to force the media to be docile, servile and practice self-censorship.\u201d\n\nMr. Ram\u00edrez was ousted Thursday after a board meeting of Unidad Editorial, El Mundo\u2019s parent company, which is owned by RCS MediaGroup, an Italian company.\n\nMr. Rajoy has not commented on Mr. Ram\u00edrez\u2019s removal. But Luis de Guindos, the economy minister, told the radio station Cope that \u201cthe government has a lot of other things to do\u201d besides trying to influence a newspaper\u2019s management.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSeveral governments of late have come under criticism by free press advocates. The top editor at Ming Pao, a newspaper in Hong Kong, was removed last month from his post by its owners, leading to complaints that his departure represented the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s efforts to subdue the territory\u2019s independent media. Last week, prosecutors in Egypt filed criminal charges accusing 20 journalists for Al Jazeera television of conspiring with the Muslim Brotherhood.\n\nIn Spain, Mr. Rajoy in August had addressed lawmakers and accused El Mundo in Parliament of manipulating information. Mr. Rajoy denounced \u201ca circle of libel\u201d against his governing Popular Party, based on accusations made by Luis B\u00e1rcenas, the Popular Party\u2019s former treasurer, who is in prison awaiting trial on charges of tax evasion and masterminding a slush fund to pay kickbacks to Mr. Rajoy and other senior conservative politicians.\n\nEl Mundo had backed Mr. Rajoy in three successive general election campaigns, the third of which \u2014 in November 2011 \u2014 allowed Mr. Rajoy and his Popular Party to return to power with an absolute majority in Parliament. Mr. Ram\u00edrez said he \u201chad a good relationship with Rajoy until he came to power.\u201d\n\nMr. Ramirez, who is commonly known in Spain as Pedro Jota (Spanish for his middle initial), started in journalism in the 1970s, just as Spain was returning to democracy and rebuilding a free press after Franco\u2019s lengthy dictatorship. In 1980, then only 28 years old, he took charge of the newspaper Diario 16, but was eventually forced out over a journalism dispute. In 1989, he started El Mundo, rapidly establishing its reputation for investigative reporting by unearthing information relating to the GAL, a secret paramilitary force sponsored by the Socialist administration to help fight ETA, the Basque separatist movement.\n\nAdvertisers in Spanish newspapers spent about 600 million euros last year, or about $808 million, less than a third of the total in 2007, just before the financial crisis. Like other Spanish newspapers, El Mundo has also struggled to switch to an online pay model; the paper\u2019s has yet to yield significant revenue. In November, RCS, the Italian group, was forced to inject \u20ac400 million of capital in Unidad Editorial, El Mundo\u2019s parent company, to keep it afloat.\n\nJuan Antonio Giner, president of Innovation, a media consultancy based in London, said Mr. Ram\u00edrez\u2019s removal could be the prelude to RCS\u2019s selling off assets or breaking up its Spanish operations.\n\n\u201cTo eliminate a strong founding editor such as Pedro J. Ram\u00edrez was a key prerequisite for potential partners in the Spanish newspaper arena to consider mergers and acquisitions changes,\u201d he said.\n\nIn fact, Mr. Ram\u00edrez\u2019s personality has generated controversy beyond the newsroom. In 1997, he became the talk of the town as a participant in a sex video. The scandal resulted in a criminal case that established the video was specifically circulated to damage El Mundo. Among those convicted was the personal assistant of Felipe Gonz\u00e1lez, Spain\u2019s former prime minister.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOn Saturday, commenting on his dismissal, Mr. Ram\u00edrez said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to present myself as a martyr or a victim, but I do think that what is happening in El Mundo is a symptom of how the quality of democracy is falling back under Rajoy.\u201d\n\nMr. Ram\u00edrez was replaced by El Mundo\u2019s deputy director, Casimiro Garc\u00eda-Abadillo, who has been with the newspaper since its 1989 creation. Asked about reports of a multimillion-dollar severance package, Mr. Ram\u00edrez demurred.\n\n\u201cI would have been happy to die as director of El Mundo without ever receiving any such indemnity money,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140202033238, "twitter": {"description": "Rather than blame his dismissal on El Mundo\u2019s financial losses, Pedro J.
