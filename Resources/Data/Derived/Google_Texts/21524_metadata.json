We especially appreciate the commitment of Kaiser\u2019s leadership to address our concerns, including working through the complicated problems associated with the changes in health care delivery, some of them related to the Affordable Care Act, and the attention it has paid in this contract to the health and safety of its registered nurses as well as its patients.\u201d\n\nIn a statement today Gregory A. Adams, regional president of Kaiser Foundation Hospitals and Health Plan, Inc., said:\n\n\u201cThis agreement is aligned with our commitment to improve our quality and affordability and to be a national model for the delivery of health care. The agreement demonstrates that Kaiser Permanente and our nurses have a shared commitment to affordability for our members. Although we have had our disagreements at times with CNA, as this agreement reflects, we have been able to work through those disagreements, and ultimately agree on common goals that are in the best interests of our members, employees and our entire organization.\u201d\n\nThe tentative agreement impacts registered nurses and nurse practitioners at 86 Kaiser facilities from Santa Rosa to Fresno, according to CNA officials.\n\nCNA membership meetings are scheduled for next week starting on Wednesday and the nurses are expected to vote to ratify the contract in the next month, Kaiser and CNA officials said.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "SFBay", "description": "Kaiser Permanente reached a tentative agreement late Friday night with the California Nurses Association/National Nurses United, averting a strike that was scheduled for next week, officials from b\u2026", "title": "Nurses union strike averted with Kaiser agreement", "url": "https://sfbay.ca/2015/01/17/nurses-union-strike-averted-with-kaiser-agreement/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "https://sfbay.ca/2015/01/17/nurses-union-strike-averted-with-kaiser-agreement/", "description": "Kaiser Permanente reached a tentative agreement late Friday night with the California Nurses Association/National \u2026", "site": "@sfbay", "card": "summary", "title": "Nurses union strike averted with Kaiser agreement"}, "fb": {"app_id": 251361551580681}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-17T22:27:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-18T02:41:40+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8dbf\"", "article_summary": "Kaiser Permanente reached a tentative agreement late Friday night with the California Nurses Association/National Nurses United, averting a strike that was scheduled for next week, officials from both sides announced today.\nThe agreement demonstrates that Kaiser Permanente and our nurses have a shared commitment to affordability for our members.\nThe three-year tentative contract impacts about 18,000 registered nurses at Kaiser Permanente hospitals and clinics in northern and central regions of the state, CNA officials said.\nThey also claimed that Kaiser provided them with insufficient resources, equipment and training that put nurses and patients at risk, CNA officials said.\nCNA membership meetings are scheduled for next week starting on Wednesday and the nurses are expected to vote to ratify the contract in the next month, Kaiser and CNA officials said."}
