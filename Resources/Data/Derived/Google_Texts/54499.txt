SANDRA SMITH (CO-HOST): So, Kennedy, can you kind of lay out the differences that we're looking at here? Little Sisters of the Poor doesn't want to be responsible for covering any birth control in line with Catholic doctrine. Other groups don't want to cover types of birth control that constitute as abortion which there are a couple of.

LISA KENNEDY MONTGOMERY (CO-HOST): I mean, what happened to liberty in this country? Not just religious liberty which is, a critical tenet of this case but liberty in general? Economic liberty. You touched on that. I side for the free market and for the nuns. The government shouldn't be forcing them at gun point, and that’s essentially what coercion is. That’s essentially what this healthcare law does. It forces you to make decisions you are morally opposed to where the government shouldn't be intruding, but my question to you is who has greater cause for celebration because of this?
