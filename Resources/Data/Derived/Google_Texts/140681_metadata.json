His minions share that opinion, as if it were flattering. Just after the big speech, The Los Angeles Times op-ed proclaimed, \u201cAbraham Lincoln\u2019s Emancipation Proclamation provides the foundational precedent for President Obama\u2019s executive order on immigrants in the country illegally.\u201d\n\nIt is a clever choice of words, using \u201cfoundational precedent\u201d as a surrogate for \u201clegal precedent,\u201d which of course neither proclamation had.\n\nThe Emancipation Proclamation was a purely political instrument, with no legal force and no constitutional authority behind it. The Times piece correctly mentions that Lincoln\u2019s Emancipation Proclamation actually freed no slaves, and it didn\u2019t even apply in the four slave states loyal to the rump United States, but only to the Confederate States of America, which was a different country. (Lincoln\u2019s proclamation had no effect on slaves held in the Union states.)\n\nObama might do as well to make his proclamation to cover citizens in France.\n\nThere are those, including Lincoln, who maintained that the South had not seceded, thereby making his Emancipation more than a political gimmick. That argument is false in many ways. If the southern states had not seceded, why then were they required to reapply for statehood? Lincoln maintained that states could not secede, yet West Virginia\u2019s secession from Virginia was encouraged by him. And if the slaves had actually been freed by Lincoln\u2019s proclamation, why was the Constitution\u2019s 13th Amendment necessary?\n\nBoth Lincoln and Obama cited principle earlier in their careers. Obama, in July of 2011, said, as he apologized for our nation\u2019s immigration laws, \u201cWith respect to the notion that I can just suspend deportations through executive order, that\u2019s just not the case, because there are laws on the books that Congress has passed\u2026 The executive branch\u2019s job is to enforce and implement those laws\u2026 There are enough laws on the books by Congress that are very clear in terms of how we have to enforce our immigration system that for me to simply, through Executive Order, ignore those congressional mandates would not conform with my appropriate role as President.\u201d Unless, of course, ignoring those laws becomes useful in a political struggle.\n\nLincoln was no better. In 1838 (at the idealistic age of 29), he said,\n\nExcept that, in becoming president and in maintaining his office, and especially in pursuit of his war, he changed course, and when the moment was politically strongest (right after the Union victory at Antietam), he broke entirely from those principle\n\nThere is a solution to unpopular law, but it isn\u2019t in despotism, which is no law at all. George Washington offered a lawful and rational solution:\n\n\u201cIf, in the opinion of the people [note: not the President], the distribution or modification of the constitutional powers be in any particular wrong, let it be corrected by an amendment in the way which the Constitution designates. But let there be no change by usurpation; for though this, in one instance, may be the instrument of good, it is the customary weapon by which free governments are destroyed. The precedent must always greatly overbalance in permanent evil any partial or transient benefit, which the use can at any time yield.\u201d\n\nThe precedents Democrats proffer, to the degree they are valid, do nothing less than reinforce the proof of the illegality of President Obama\u2019s actions.\n\nBut the Obama of March, 2011, still afloat (courtesy Harry Reid and Eric Holder) after his policies\u2019 2010 election \u201cshellacking\u201d and realizing he had to stand for re-election in 2012, knew he couldn\u2019t yet move to take over completely.\n\nIn July of 2011, he said,\n\n\u201cI know some people want me to bypass Congress and change the laws on my own. Believe me, the idea of doing things on my own is very tempting, I promise you. Not just on immigration reform. But that\u2019s not how our system works. That\u2019s not how our democracy functions. That\u2019s not how our Constitution is written.\u201d\n\nHe soon started changing all sorts of important parts of his own Affordable Care Act, and was re-elected partly because of this cunning\u2026\n\nAs usual, George Washington understood it best, as he warned against the avarice and hunger for power so often found among those who seek office:\n\n\u201cIt is important\u2026that the habits of thinking in a free country should inspire caution in those entrusted with its administration, to confine themselves within their respective constitutional spheres, avoiding in the exercise of the powers of one department to encroach upon another. The spirit of encroachment tends to consolidate the powers of all the departments in one, and thus to create, whatever the form of government, a real despotism.\u201d\n\nWashington knew well what had to be done about despotism; he spent years driving a despotic government from our shores and more years crafting the Republic he bequeathed us.\n\nWashington died of natural causes, immersed in the warmth of the grateful nation he helped found. Lincoln, in contrast, was killed by a rebel jihadist. What will happen to Obama?\n\nWill the American people be heard in D.C., and return the nation to limited, constitutional government? If not, I repeat: what will happen to Obama?", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Obama, like candidate Obama and Senator Obama before him, has often made the case that he is like President Abraham Lincoln.", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "author": "Tim Kern", "og": {"site_name": "Communities Digital News", "description": "President Obama, like candidate Obama and Senator Obama before him, has often made the case that he is like President Abraham Lincoln.", "title": "Obama is to Obamacare as Lincoln is to the Emancipation Proclamation", "url": "http://www.commdiginews.com/politics-2/commentary/obama-is-to-obamacare-as-lincoln-is-to-the-emancipation-proclamation-30882/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://www.commdiginews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/lincoln.jpg", "height": 425}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "President Obama, like candidate Obama and Senator Obama before him, has often made the case that he is like President Abraham Lincoln.", "title": "Obama is to Obamacare as Lincoln is to the Emancipation Proclamation", "image": "http://www.commdiginews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/lincoln-435x375.jpg", "creator": "@commdiginews", "site": "@commdiginews", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "obama,obamacare,lincoln,emancipation proclamation", "propeller": "a20eada6e38f74d5c5bf31354ee9760c", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-03T15:01:41+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-03T15:01:41+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Emancipation Proclamation, Lincoln, obama, obamacare"}, "article_summary": "INDIANAPOLIS, December 3, 2014 \u2013 President Obama, like candidate Obama and Senator Obama before him, has often made the case that he is like President Abraham Lincoln.\nAnd if the slaves had actually been freed by Lincoln\u2019s proclamation, why was the Constitution\u2019s 13th Amendment necessary?\n(Lincoln\u2019s proclamation had no effect on slaves held in the Union states.)\nThe Emancipation Proclamation was a purely political instrument, with no legal force and no constitutional authority behind it.\nThere are those, including Lincoln, who maintained that the South had not seceded, thereby making his Emancipation more than a political gimmick."}
