The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas has ruled in favor of the universities - essentially blocking school employees from accessing free post-fertilization contraception under the schools' health plans.  The case is the latest in a series court challenges to a Health and Human Services regulation, promulgated in conjunction with the Affordable Care Act, requiring employers to provide health coverage for 20 methods of contraception approved by the Food and Drug Administration.  The Health and Human Services policies, Rassbach said in the filing that set the case in motion, violate the universities' rights under the 1993 U.S. Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which provides that the government shall not \"substantially burden\" an individual's exercise of religion.  In issuing its order to provide health insurance covering contraception, Health and Human Services exempted churches and their auxiliaries, religious orders and companies employing fewer than 50 people.  Rassbach charged in his initial brief that the regulations were \"promulgated by government officials and promoted by non-governmental organizations who strongly oppose religious teachings and beliefs regarding marriage and family.\"  Kathleen Sebelius, who was HHS secretary at the time, \"has long been a staunch supporter of abortion rights and a vocal critic of religious teachings and beliefs regarding abortion and contraception,\" he wrote.", "vf": {"section": "local", "unique_id": "premiumchron-article-6180438"}, "author.name": "By Allan Turner", "og": {"site_name": "Houston Chronicle", "description": "The New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals this week will take up a Texas case centering on how - or if - employees of religious colleges and nonprofits will be given free access to \"morning after\" pills and related forms of birth control as mandated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
