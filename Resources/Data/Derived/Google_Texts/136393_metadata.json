There have been at least 18 known cases of burl poaching from redwoods in the past year, forcing the closing of one California state highway at night, with more to follow.\n\nRELATED: Desperate Poachers Hack Burls From Iconic Redwoods for Cash\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just a property crime,\u201d said Brett Silver, supervising ranger for Redwood National and State Parks in California, to The New York Times. \u201cIt\u2019s a legacy, like hacking up a church.\u201d\n\nThis the Yurok certainly feel, regarding redwoods as \u201csacred living beings\u201d that \u201cstand as guardians over our sacred places,\u201d the tribe says on its website.\n\nBurls range in size from small enough to be crafted into salt and pepper shakers, as The New York Times points out, to large enough to weigh hundreds of pounds and be fashioned into furniture. The slabs of raw wood that are used to make furniture can sell for hundreds or even thousands of dollars each, The New York Times said.\n\nIn March, the National Park Service announced it would close the Newton B. Drury Scenic Parkway at night to try and hamper the operations, which tend to be conducted under cover of darkness. While the poaching of wood in general is not new, a slow economy combined with an increase in methamphetamine use have made poachers bolder, the newspaper said.\n\n\u201cThey have been targeting ever-bigger burls and using increasingly brazen tactics,\u201d The New York Times reported. \u201cLast year, a redwood estimated to be 400 years old was felled by thieves who wanted access to a 500-pound burl 60 feet up.\u201d\n\nBurls are essential to a redwood\u2019s reproduction, the National Park Service said.\n\n\u201cBurl is a woody material full of un-sprouted bud tissue,\u201d the NPS said in a leaflet about the trees. \u201cIt serves as a storage compartment for the genetic code of the parent tree. If the redwood falls or is damaged, the burl may sprout another redwood tree known as a clone.\u201d\n\nRead Poachers Attack Beloved Elders of California, Its Redwoods in The New York Times.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The New York Times is raising the alarm on redwood poaching.The New York Times has raised the alarm on redwood poaching with an article on April 8, 2014", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "theresa", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/04/10/new-york-times-raises-alarm-redwood-poaching-154393", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/scarred_redwood-national_park_svce.jpeg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "New York Times Raises the Alarm on Redwood Poaching"}, "dcterms.date": "2014-04-10T15:30-04:00", "dc": {"title": "New York Times Raises the Alarm on Redwood Poaching"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/04/10/new-york-times-raises-alarm-redwood-poaching-154393", "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Redwood Forest, National Park Service, California, Poaching", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 1}, "dcterms.title": "New York Times Raises the Alarm on Redwood Poaching"}, "article_summary": "The New York Times is raising the alarm on redwood poaching.\nIf the redwood falls or is damaged, the burl may sprout another redwood tree known as a clone.\u201dRead Poachers Attack Beloved Elders of California, Its Redwoods in The New York Times.\n\u201cThey have been targeting ever-bigger burls and using increasingly brazen tactics,\u201d The New York Times reported.\nThe slabs of raw wood that are used to make furniture can sell for hundreds or even thousands of dollars each, The New York Times said.\nRELATED: Desperate Poachers Hack Burls From Iconic Redwoods for Cash\u201cIt\u2019s not just a property crime,\u201d said Brett Silver, supervising ranger for Redwood National and State Parks in California, to The New York Times."}
