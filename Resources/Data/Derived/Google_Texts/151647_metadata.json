Jay Nixon\u2019s veto, and a \u201cbroad-based coalition\u201d of hundreds of supporting businesses and individuals.\n\nBut 98 percent of the group\u2019s funding comes from just one source, Carpenters Help In the Political Process, or CHIPP.\n\nCHIPP is a political action committee run by the Carpenters\u2019 District Council of St. Louis & Vicinity. Like Protect MO Families, CHIPP operates out of the union\u2019s St. Louis headquarters. Martin Walter, a business agent for the union, is the treasurer for both CHIPP and Protect MO Families.\n\nProtect MO Families was created by the Carpenters\u2019 District Council of St. Louis & Vicinity in 2013, according to a disclosure filed with the Missouri Ethics Commission.\n\nSince its creation, Protect MO Families has received campaign contributions totaling more than $1.3 million. In the past year, Protect MO Families has received $740,000 from CHIPP and just $1,015 from all other donors combined.\n\nMost of the non-CHIPP donations to Protect MO Families have come from Carpenters\u2019 District Council employees and from other labor unions.\n\nWhy did Carpenters\u2019 District Council of St. Louis & Vicinity create a separate PAC to fight right-to-work, when the union already had CHIPP?\n\nUnlike \u201cCarpenters Help In the Political Process,\u201d the name \u201cProtect MO Families\u201d doesn\u2019t suggest any connection to the Carpenters or any other labor union.\n\nAnyone who knows that right-to-work laws allow workers to opt out of paying union dues would expect unions to be against it \u2014 so unions fight right-to-work from behind \u201cbroad-based coalitions\u201d with harmless names.\n\nRELATED: Here\u2019s why unions hate right-to-work\n\nNo disclaimer or explanation on the Protect MO Families website, Facebook page or Twitter timeline acknowledges the PAC is funded by the Carpenters\u2019 union and operates from Carpenters\u2019 union headquarters.\n\nThe Carpenters\u2019 District Council and other unions are using Protect MO Families to keep the Republican supermajority in the Legislature from overriding the Democrat governor\u2019s veto of right-to-work.\n\nAccording to Protect MO Families, right-to-work is part of a \u201cwar on the middle class\u201d being waged by \u201ccorporate extremists and self-interested politicians.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s intentionally misleading, Americans for Prosperity deputy state director Rachel Payton told Watchdog.org. AFP-Missouri staff and volunteers have encouraged lawmakers to support right-to-work.\n\n\u201cWe have 72,000 activists in Missouri,\u201d Payton said. \u201cThese are hard-working Missourians that are worried about making our state a better state. I think protecting Missouri families is about actually protecting and growing our economy, so Missourians can stay in Missouri and follow their dreams in Missouri, instead of chasing their dreams elsewhere.\u201d\n\nPayton said it\u2019s her group that actually protects Missouri families. She said she has lived in Missouri since she was 12 years old, and doesn\u2019t want to see her children leave the state to find work.\n\nProtect MO Families and Carpenters\u2019 District Council of St. Louis & Vicinity failed to respond to questions from Watchdog.org about the campaign.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A \"broad-based coalition\" fighting right-to-work in Missouri has a donor base so narrow, it's limited almost exclusively to one labor union.", "og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "A \"broad-based coalition\" fighting right-to-work in Missouri has a donor base so narrow, it's limited almost exclusively to one labor union.", "title": "Missouri group fighting right-to-work is a Carpenters union front - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/08/protectmofamilies-facebook-2015-08-06.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-08-26T08:24:12+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/234842/protect-missouri-carpenters-union/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "A \"broad-based coalition\" fighting right-to-work in Missouri has a donor base so narrow, it's limited almost exclusively to one labor union.", "title": "Missouri group fighting right-to-work is a Carpenters union front - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/08/protectmofamilies-facebook-2015-08-06.jpg"}, "creator": "@jasonahart", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Labor", "published_time": "2015-08-26T04:00:16+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-26T08:24:12+00:00"}, "news_keywords": "protectmo, protect missouri families, protect mo families, carpenters union, rachel payton, martin walter, chipp, carpenters help in the political process, carpenters district council of st louis"}, "article_summary": "I think protecting Missouri families is about actually protecting and growing our economy, so Missourians can stay in Missouri and follow their dreams in Missouri, instead of chasing their dreams elsewhere.\u201dPayton said it\u2019s her group that actually protects Missouri families.\nWhy did Carpenters\u2019 District Council of St. Louis & Vicinity create a separate PAC to fight right-to-work, when the union already had CHIPP?\nCHIPP is a political action committee run by the Carpenters\u2019 District Council of St. Louis & Vicinity.\nProtect MO Families and Carpenters\u2019 District Council of St. Louis & Vicinity failed to respond to questions from Watchdog.org about the campaign.\nUnlike \u201cCarpenters Help In the Political Process,\u201d the name \u201cProtect MO Families\u201d doesn\u2019t suggest any connection to the Carpenters or any other labor union."}
