Rand Paul (R-KY), a contender for the 2016 GOP nomination, flexed his potential presidential campaign muscles during a trip here this weekend\u2014showing off his pull with grassroots voters and his ability to win over donors.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nAfter arriving late Friday night after a speech in Montgomery, Alabama\u2014Paul was the keynote before the Alabama GOP\u2019s annual winter dinner\u2014Paul on Saturday morning kicked off his day by holding a roundtable discussion with local doctors about healthcare policy.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s very helpful to have someone familiar with healthcare here both inside the beltway and outside the beltway,\u201d Dr. W.G. Eshbaugh, a reconstructive and cosmetic plastic surgeon from the Naples area said. \u201cHe\u2019s had a private practice and is able to articulate many of the challenges we face. It was a real pleasure to have that discussion with him.\u201d\n\nEshbaugh was a year behind Paul at Duke Medical School\u2014where Paul studied to become an ophthalmologist. Paul and his wife Kelly then moved to Bowling Green, Kentucky, where Paul practiced for more than a decade before he scored a surprising Senate primary win against the Mitch McConnell-backed Trey Grayson in 2010. As a U.S. Senator, he\u2019s now one of the leading Republicans\u2014along with Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush\u2014potentially vying for the GOP nomination in 2016.\n\nSergio Gor, Paul\u2019s energetic communications director, explained to Breitbart News that Paul plans to highlight the fact he is a doctor on the campaign trail, and Paul has frequently held such roundtable type meetings with doctors nationwide on many occasions.\n\n\u201cPart of Sen. Paul\u2019s appeal both inside of politics and outside of politics is he was a doctor and surgeon for so many years,\u201d Gor told Breitbart News as Paul wrapped up the meeting.\n\nSo you\u2019re able to get a lot of doctors and surgeons from all over the country who are interested whether it\u2019s their first time [meeting with a politician] or they\u2019re regularly politically involved. You get a lot of doctors upset about Obamacare, about new regulations from Washington. While everyone can be against Obamacare, doctors understand the exact intricacies and the small details that someone like Dr. Paul would understand. When they\u2019re involved in day-to-day practice, they\u2019re able to relate to what he\u2019s saying. He knows it in and out. One of the things we do is almost everywhere the senator travels we\u2019ll invite a group of physicians and they\u2019ll invite some of their other physicians and this happens all across the United States.\n\nOn Paul\u2019s trip, both Cato Institute president John Allison and Rep. Curt Clawson (R-FL) hinted that they believe Paul may very well win. Clawson said that while he\u2019ll back whoever wins the GOP primary in the general, he plans on backing Paul in the primary. And Allison predicted that given the current political environment, Paul will become the next president of the United States of America.\n\nThat\u2019s what Paul is projecting himself as: The conservative Republican who can go the distance, battle former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush in the primary then defeat Hillary Clinton\u2014or whomever else Democrats may nominate should they decide against coronating the former Secretary of State\u2014and get elected to the White House.\n\nPaul is doing that by painting himself as the perennial outsider, the man of the people\u2014and a grassroots champion for liberty and the values of ordinary Americans. Paul has, in recent weeks, amassed an impressive array of campaign operatives. He outmaneuvered potential rivals Cruz and former Texas Gov. Rick Perry to get Texas state GOP chairman Steve Munisteri to join his campaign-in-waiting and picked up Chip Englander\u2014a young data-and-ground-game-savvy GOP operative who led newly elected Republican Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner\u2019s campaign in 2014\u2014to run his presidential effort should he run.\n\nWhile in Naples on Saturday, Paul also held a meeting with grassroots activists where he spoke then took questions\u2014a meeting that occurred across the hall from the doctor roundtable. It was there that Clawson\u2014a businessman before his election to Congress\u2014introduced Paul, and Paul praised outsiders like Clawson while railing against the political class in Washington, D.C.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good to have people like Curt in Congress\u2014we have very few people who have any business sense at all,\u201d Paul said.\n\nWe\u2019ve got a few community organizers. Maybe one too many. But nobody has any sense about it. People say why is government so messed up? Why do we make so many bad decisions in government? It\u2019s because government is not like business at all. If I asked you to give me $10,000 today and we\u2019re going to collect it all and form a business, my guess is you\u2019re going to want to know my business plan before you give me any money. My guess is you\u2019re going to think about it and ask well, my gosh, is this a good investment and could I lose $10,000? What kind of work did it take me to get that $10,000? But if you ask a politician to spend $10,000 or $10 million or $10 billion, do you think it bothers them? Do you think they lay awake at night saying \u201coh gosh, I lost $10 billion on that one because that one didn\u2019t work out so well?\u201d\n\nPaul\u2019s decision to focus on this corner of Florida is telling. With Bush and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) both likely also in the race, one of those two\u2014or one of the other more liberal Republicans\u2014is likely to win Florida\u2019s GOP primary in 2016. Paul may have a shot there, but this event seemed more focused on the general election.\n\n\u201cWe have had, in 2012, we turned out 88.7 percent of the Republican voters in the county\u2014the highest in the state,\u201d Collier County Republican Party chairman Mike Lyster told Breitbart News in a brief interview before Paul spoke at the grassroots event Saturday morning.\n\nIn 2014, which nationally was an off-year election, we turned out almost 72 percent which again was the highest in the state for any county that has 100,000 voters. Our grassroots folks really work the grassroots and get the vote out. We just saw that as an opportunity to start reaching out to the candidates and bringing them in and giving them an opportunity to talk to our grassroots folks.\n\nLyster added that he tells everyone he knows in Republican politics that \u201cCollier County is the county that offset some of those east coast counties that vote Democrat.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery vote counts,\u201d he said, detailing the county\u2019s sophisticated GOP operation that will help whoever wins the nomination in 2016 in the general election. \u201cWe have a number of people who are today motivated to\u2014I get demands probably once a week by people saying they want a list of every voter in their neighborhood so they can start finding out who they are and start engaging and interacting with them. We couldn\u2019t do it without all those volunteers that step up and carry the load.\u201d\n\nJan Glassman, another grassroots activist who sits on the executive committee of the Collier County Republican Party\u2014and splits her time between Florida and New Hampshire, another early primary state\u2014spoke highly of Paul as well and noted similar things about the GOP influence Collier County has in the general election in the all-important state of Florida.\n\n\u201cNumber one, I think candidates come here to raise money,\u201d Glassman told Breitbart News. \u201cBut number two, Collier County turns out the greatest percentage of Republican votes in the state\u2014a very, very Republican county. It can make all the difference. George Bush won by 537 votes I think it was? Something like that\u2014very, very small.\u201d\n\nGlassman spoke highly of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and Paul. About Paul, she noted she met him when he endorsed former Sen. Scott Brown\u2019s campaign against Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) at the University of New Hampshire last cycle.\n\n\u201cI saw him at UNH last summer,\u201d Glassman said. \u201cHe\u2019s a great guy. He resonates. His dad always resonated with young people.\u201d\n\nPaul showed off his fundraising appeal later in the day, attending a finance meeting with several high-level donors from the area but the most interesting thing is he seems to be able to walk in both worlds: Appeal to the donors, and appeal to the grassroots.\n\nIn fact, during that finance meeting as Paul was speaking to the donors on the outdoor balcony of a function room at the spacious Ritz Carlton that day, a young man walking by on the pathway down below from one area of the resort to another overheard him and stopped to listen to his full speech. Matt DeBernardo, the young man who supported Paul\u2019s father before was just on vacation from Connecticut down in Naples staying at the resort, told Breitbart News he stopped to listen to Paul speak to the donors because he loved what he heard.\n\n\u201cIt was an awesome experience\u2014it was so unexpected,\u201d DeBernardo said. \u201cEverywhere you go you try to find people who like you or have the same beliefs, so it\u2019s funny that in passing you meet someone who you follow and whose father you support.\u201d\n\nPerhaps even more importantly than being able to appeal to broad sects of the GOP, many in the grassroots seem to agree with Paul\u2019s positions on when America should go to war and aren\u2019t being influence by mainstream media and Washington-based foreign policy establishment community efforts to paint him as an isolationist.\n\n\u201cSen. Paul, I\u2019m a veteran. We have never won a war in my lifetime. And I\u2019m talking about in Vietnam, we lost 15,272 troops. I\u2019m sick and tired of us going into somebody else\u2019s empire and trying to build our own. I think we should bring those soldiers home and put them on the southern border and do something to protect our country. That\u2019s what I\u2019m in favor of. How do you feel,\u201d Jon Larsen Shudlick, a veteran who served as a Provost Marshal Investigator for the U.S. Army based in Korea during the Vietnam era, asked of Paul to kick off the question-and-answer session of the grassroots meeting.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t agree more,\u201d Paul responded.\n\nWhen we do have to be involved, we do it to defend ourselves and American interests and we vote on it in Congress. The one thing about the Constitution is it didn\u2019t give this power to the president. It isn\u2019t a unilateral power of the president. We have a debate in our country, an open debate, and we decide how to defend our country and what we have to do to defend ourselves. The only reason I say we have to do something now is because I think our embassy in Baghdad and our consulate in Erbil need to be defended. I\u2019ve criticized Hillary Clinton nonstop for not defending Benghazi and I think we do have to defend ourselves. But I have said I\u2019m not sending one American GI to take Mosul if the Iraqis are not willing to fight for it. They need to fight. There are going to need to be boots on the ground. But the boots on the ground need to be Arab boots on the ground. Frankly, I\u2019d like to see 10,000 Saudi Arabians leading every march into battle.\n\nThe entire room rose in applause for Paul, one of his many standing ovations he got throughout that morning event.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rand Paul Flexes 2016 Muscles On Florida Trip, Campaigns Against DC Political Class", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Rand Paul Flexes 2016 Muscles On Florida Trip, Campaigns Against DC Political Class", "title": "Rand Paul Flexes 2016 Muscles On Florida Trip, Campaigns Against DC Political Class - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/rand-paul-jacket-afp.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/02/25/rand-paul-flexes-2016-muscles-on-florida-trip-campaigns-against-dc-political-class/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Rand Paul Flexes 2016 Muscles On Florida Trip, Campaigns Against DC Political Class", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/rand-paul-jacket-afp.jpg", "title": "Rand Paul Flexes 2016 Muscles On Florida Trip, Campaigns Against DC Political Class - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "2016, Chris Christie, Florida, Jeb Bush, Rand Paul, Rick Perry, Scott Walker, Ted Cruz,2016 Presidential Race, Big Government,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "Ted Cruz", "published_time": "2015-02-25T04:54:22-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "\u201cBut number two, Collier County turns out the greatest percentage of Republican votes in the state\u2014a very, very Republican county.\nClawson said that while he\u2019ll back whoever wins the GOP primary in the general, he plans on backing Paul in the primary.\nThat\u2019s what Paul is projecting himself as: The conservative Republican who can go the distance, battle former Florida Gov.\nAnd Allison predicted that given the current political environment, Paul will become the next president of the United States of America.\nOn Paul\u2019s trip, both Cato Institute president John Allison and Rep.
