But, with five years into the job and with Obama pledging that he could turn things around, it is now his record that must be examined.\n\nIn 2008 when Barack Obama was running for office he had all the answers for all that ailed us. Sadly as president, none of his efforts have had the positive impact on the economy that was anticipated or realized. If Obama in 2008 had told us what the economy would look like, as it exists today \u2014 he would not have been elected. He felt the need to exaggerate and overpromise to get elected.\n\nThe American people have given Obama every benefit to succeed. However, the president has never risen to the occasion.\n\nThere is no doubt that Obama inherited a bad economy but he made it worse by turning his attention to the creation of Obamacare instead of fixing that which needed immediate attention and action and that is job creation, budget discipline, debt reduction, and tax reform.\n\nA clear an unbiased look at the economic metrics clearly sets forth the across-the-board failures of the Obama administration to improve the national economy to date:\n\nThe president is in the midterm of his full tenure as president. He can improve his final grade on the economy \u2014 only if he dramatically changes course and turns his attention to working across the aisle to find common ground and compromise on economic solutions to our pressing challenges.\n\nThe key to the next three years will be the results of the 2014 midterm elections. Either way the president of the United States gets the credit or the blame for the economic welfare of America.\n\nMr. President, your legacy will be the economy and Obamacare. Those issues will determine your final grade.\n\nBradley A. Blakeman served as deputy assistant to President George W. Bush from 2001-04.
