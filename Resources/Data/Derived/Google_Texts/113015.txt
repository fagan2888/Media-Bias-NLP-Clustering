The bodies of a husband and wife were found in a home near 54th Avenue and Camelback Road Sunday afternoon. Police are calling the incident a murder-suicide.

Police say the male victim, 43-year-old Adan Chavez, and the female victim, 33-year-old Jessica Rubacalba, both lived in the home where the pair was found.

Homicide detectives have determined that Chavez first shot Rubalcava and then turned the gun on himself.

A weapon was found at the scene.

The bodies were discovered when family members went to the home earlier in the day, apparently to make a welfare check on the couple. They had apparently been trying to contact the couple since 1 a.m. When no one at the home responded, the relatives kicked in the door.

Rubacalba's cousin, Natalie Casillas says the family is devastated. "The family is all grieving. It's just so terrible," Natalie said.

The family didn't want to talk about what might have led up to the shooting but do say their focus is now on taking care of the couple's three young children.

"I am going to love her kids for her, they are what's important right now," Natalie said.

The three children weren't home at the time of the murder. The investigation is ongoing.
