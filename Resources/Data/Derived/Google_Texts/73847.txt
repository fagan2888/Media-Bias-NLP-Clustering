Commentary: The Affordable Care Act reporting deadlines are rapidly approaching, presenting a major administrative burden for employers who face penalties for failing to report in a timely and accurate manner. While there has been significant discussion of employer roles and responsibilities, employees have been largely left out of the equation. However, many employees will soon be receiving new forms that are critical to their ability to file their tax returns and to their employersâ€™ ability to accurately fulfill their own reporting requirements. Among these are Forms 1095-A, 1095-B and 1095-C.

With this in mind, it is important for employers to educate individual taxpayers on what they are required to do and when and how to complete these requirements in the easiest and most efficient manner.
