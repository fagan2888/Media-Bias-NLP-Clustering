PARKER, Ariz. (AP) — A Phoenix couple has claimed responsibility for putting two fake skeletons sitting in lawn chairs in the Colorado River in far west Arizona.

The Today’s News-Herald reports (http://bit.ly/1zNKrAl) the husband and wife approached the La Paz County Sheriff’s Office earlier this week and brought a photo as proof they were behind the prank in Parker.

Lt. Curt Bagby says there are no plans to press charges and considers the incident harmless.

Bagby says the couple and another diver placed the plastic skeletons on lawn chairs last year, tying them to underwater rocks.

The group thought it would make for a humorous landmark.

He says all three have gone back to the site several times since.

Bagby says that unless federal agencies have any issues, the skeletons will remain in place.
