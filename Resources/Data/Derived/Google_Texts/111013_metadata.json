He added:\n\nWe have those who have tried to make [capitalism] sound like a bad word. It\u2019s not a bad word\u2014it is the highest standard of liberty that anybody has ever accomplished.\n\nAlluding to socialism, Carson said policies that force individuals into government dependency are the opposite of compassion.\n\n\u201cThe government doesn\u2019t understand what compassion means,\u201d he said. \u201cThey think [it means] patting somebody on the head and saying, \u2018There, there you poor little thing, I\u2019m going to take care of all of your needs.\u2019\u201d\n\nAmericans have to focus on creating a path for individuals who are dependent on government programs to have the opportunity to join the \u201cstrength and fabric\u201d of the nation, Carson said:\n\nThat\u2019s how we become strong as a nation. The fewer people we have to pull along and the more people who become part of the productive side of America, the better off it will be for everybody.\n\nThe acclaimed neurosurgeon encouraged individuals from all along the political spectrum to set aside anger and concentrate on having conversations to discuss differences and find solutions.\n\nSome Americans are angry, he said, but they need to \u201ccalm down and use the amazing intellect that God has given us,\u201d so that fear doesn\u2019t affect judgment.
