Democrats called Friday for the congressional inquiry into the Benghazi attacks to be dissolved, pointing to Hillary Rodham Clinton's marathon testimony the day before that they say left no doubt it was simply a "taxpayer-funded fishing expedition."

But they backed off a previous threat to quit the committee altogether.

The five House Democrats on the panel consulted with Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) on Friday, after which they demanded that Speaker John A. Boehner "immediately shut down this abusive, wasteful and obviously partisan effort."

But barring that unlikely decision, the Democrats said in a statement that they would continue to serve on it "to make sure that the facts are known and conspiracy theories are debunked."

The five members – including Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Burbank) and Linda Sanchez (D-Whittier) – also called on the panel's chairman, Rep. Trey Gowdy of South Carolina, to release the transcripts of all witness interviews.

Before Thursday's hearing, Schiff was among those suggesting that by continuing to participate in the probe, Democrats were granting it legitimacy it did not deserve. He pointed to the Republicans' move to form a similar committee to investigate Planned Parenthood as an example of why Democrats should be concerned with what they increasingly see as a partisan investigation.

But if they were to leave the committee, they would lose the ability to access its work, of concern in the event of selective leaks from the other side.

At a Democratic National Committee event earlier Friday, Pelosi praised the five Democratic members of the committee for the role they played at the Clinton hearing and cited the comment from a Clinton rival during last week's Democratic debate that the panel's ongoing probe into her emails is overblown.

"As Bernie Sanders said, and as we all know, enough is enough," Pelosi said.
