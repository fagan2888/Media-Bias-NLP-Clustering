Dallas-Fort Worth has had more freezes this winter than any other in the last 30 years, the National Weather Service said Friday.

The report said the 51 freezes at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport this year ranks the seventh-most on record, tying it with 1983-84 and 1976-77.

The record for most freezes is 62, set in 1977-78.

This meteorological winter, which runs from December to February, was the 20th-coldest on record, with nights particularly brutal. The average low temperature was the 11th-coldest.

Dan Huckaby, a National Weather Service meteorologist, said the area has had its share of wintry weather events the past decade, but arctic air masses have come more frequently this year. Arctic air tends to be dry, he said, allowing heat to escape at night without cloud cover.

“It’s really one of those things that happens with the weather,” Huckaby said. “Occasionally we get some arctic intrusions that come into Texas and give us some cold weather.”

But the “heat island” in Dallas-Fort Worth makes it hard to break record low temperatures set before the area urbanized, Huckaby said. Outlying areas to the south and northwest, he said, have seen even more freezes.

We’re not done with the cold just yet. A frigid front is expected to hit Dallas-Fort Worth sometime Sunday morning, with a winter weather advisory in effect from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m. Forecasts call for a fast dip in temperatures to the freezing mark, with a chance for freezing rain and sleet.

Next up on the freeze-record chart is 1911-12 at No. 6 with 53.

But hey, at least we’re not in Chicago, where up to six inches of snow could fall Saturday. The meteorological winter, according to the Chicago Tribune, was the third snowiest and third coldest for Chicagoans since 1871.
