In the first couple of sips, the predominant taste is the sparkling wine that has drifted to the top, for Ms. Stravelli\u2019s bright, rippling voice exudes a natural effervescence. Before long, it darkens, and the heady liquor underneath kicks in.\n\nThe first two songs \u2014 \u201cWhile We\u2019re Young\u201d and \u201cHappy Talk\u201d \u2014 at Thursday\u2019s opening night show at the Metropolitan Room conveyed an undiluted joy. The upbeat mood continued in a more romantic vein, with a \u201cdream\u201d medley (\u201cDream Dancing,\u201d \u201cI Had the Craziest Dream,\u201d \u201cI Can Dream, Can\u2019t I?\u201d) that evoked the dark ages of modesty, longing and sublimation in the dating arena.\n\nThen the texture changed, as Ms. Stravelli, accompanied by an excellent trio \u2014 Joshua Richman on piano, Pat O\u2019Leary on bass and Eric Halvorson on drums \u2014 unfurled new layers of her remarkable voice. As she dipped and swooped, twirling notes and phrases with a confidence and playfulness that recalled Ella Fitzgerald in her prime, Mr. Stravelli began interpreting lyrics with a ferocity that her vocal pyrotechnics accentuated, and the show\u2019s theme emerged.\n\nThe character Ms. Stravelli created was a woman who chooses the wrong men, because the intoxicating charms of a sexy cad are too powerful to resist. Instead of masochistic self-pity, her attitude toward her preference was a smirking complicity, as if to say, \u201cYou and I both know that some pleasures are worth the pain.\u201d Her amusing defense for her crowingly vindictive rendition of \u201cGoody Goody\u201d was her Sicilian temperament.\n\nMs. Stravelli moved confidently into classic soul music with the great Aretha Franklin tribute to sexual healing, \u201cDo Right Woman, Do Right Man.\u201d In the riveting summary number, \u201cRunnin\u2019 Back for More,\u201d written by Ms. Stravelli with Mr. O\u2019Leary and Jason Robinson, she tells her lying, cheating, stealing boyfriend, \u201cI\u2019m getting a bad education, and you\u2019re my professor.\u201d\n\nThe show, directed by the singer Marilyn Maye, received the kind of tumultuous ovation I haven\u2019t seen at the Metropolitan Room since Ms. Maye\u2019s initial appearances there more than five years ago.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "feature", "ptime":
