(AP) \u2014 The suspected killer of a state trooper, who has eluded a massive dragnet for nearly two weeks, might be treating the manhunt in the Pennsylvania woods as a game against law enforcement, according to police.\n\nEric Frein, 31, appears to have purposely made himself visible at times, staying just far enough away to make it unlikely he\u2019d be caught in the rough terrain, said state police Lt. Col George Bivens.\n\n\u201cI almost think that some of this is a game to him,\u201d Bivens said Wednesday.\n\nUpwards of 1,000 law enforcement officials have been involved in the search for Frein, who is charged with gunning down Cpl. Bryon Dickson and wounding Trooper Alex Douglass in a Sept. 12 ambush outside their barracks in Blooming Grove. Since then, Wednesday was the first time authorities have reported possibly laying eyes on the suspect, describing him as wearing black clothing and sometimes a hood.\n\nPolice found Frein\u2019s Jeep submerged in a swamp a few miles from the barracks, and believe he walked 15 or 20 miles south to hide in the wilderness surrounding his hometown of Canadensis. He is considered armed and dangerous, and police have authority to kill him if he doesn\u2019t surrender.\n\nIn an indication of just how wild the landscape is, tactical teams have \u201ckicked out quite a few bears\u201d as they searched for Frein in caves, Bivens said. Police have also obtained search warrants to search vacant homes, using locksmiths to gain access.\n\nOfficers have found items they say Frein either stashed or left behind, including an assault rifle, ammunition, empty packs of Serbian-branded cigarettes and soiled diapers. Frein, described as a self-taught survivalist, might be using the diapers to remain stationary for long periods of time, Bivens said. Police are testing the diapers to confirm Frein wore them.\n\nThe developments come as the American Civil Liberties Union and other lawyers have questioned law enforcement tactics that have given some local residents only sporadic access to their homes.\n\n\u201cI almost think that some of this is a game to him.\u201d Share:\n\nAttorney Joshua Prince of Bechtelsville told The Associated Press on Wednesday that one resident told him he was kept away from his house for days, and returned home Tuesday night to find his dogs had defecated all over the property.\n\n\u201cThere is no general blanket allowance for setting the Constitution aside because the Pennsylvania State Police and the FBI are doing an investigation or manhunt,\u201d Prince said.\n\nBivens said troopers are \u201cdoing their best to balance safety concerns with the needs for residents to be able to travel freely to and from their homes.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "CANADENSIS, Pa.
