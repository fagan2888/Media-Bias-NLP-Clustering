With employers holding the line on firings as the economy improves, this could be a hopeful sign for labor market growth.\n\nLast month there were 31,434 anticipated job cuts announced; that\u2019s 20 percent lower than the same month a year ago, and much lower than May\u2019s 52,961 cuts, according to a report Thursday from Chicago-based outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, Inc.\n\n\n\nCourtesy of Challenger, Gray & Christmas\n\nThe top job-cutting sector in June was entertainment and leisure activity, due mostly to the closure of two casinos in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Through the first half of the year, the most layoffs occurred in the computer industry, where companies announced their intent to cut 30,002 jobs. With 26,863 planned job cuts through June, retailers also experienced heavy downsizing.\n\n\u201cThe holidays were not kind to several retailers who answered with heavy layoffs in the first quarter,\u201d said John Challenger, CEO of Challenger, Gray & Christmas. \u201cWe saw large scale job cut announcements from Macy\u2019s, Best Buy, J.C. Penney and Sears to start out the year. Meanwhile, one of the largest job cuts of the year so far resulted from the bankruptcy of Coldwater Creek, which resulted in 5,500 layoffs.\u201d\n\nChallenger pointed out that the retail industry does continue to grow, though, and employment is vulnerable to changes in technology and consumer demand. He also noted that change in the technology sector occurs rapidly and \u201csome of the larger, less nimble companies are sometimes forced to alter their course and that can be painful.\u201d\n\nFor example, he said, in the first part of the year, Hewlett-Packard and Intel both announced large layoffs.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "employment", "title": "Planned Job Cuts Reach Lowest Level of 2014", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "U.S. businesses in June announced 41 percent fewer layoffs than in May, a report Thursday showed.", "title": "Planned Job Cuts Reach Lowest Level of 2014", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/07/03/planned-job-cuts-reach-lowest-level-of-2014", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/c6/dd/daa83ed44e3c9d35a06de3b56f3a/140702-jobs-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Planned Job Cuts Reach Lowest Level of 2014", "description": "U.S. businesses in June announced 41 percent fewer layoffs than in May, a report Thursday showed.", "card": "summary", "site": "@USNews"}, "site": "news", "date_published": "July 3, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Katherine Peralta,Pulse,employment", "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "U.S. businesses in June announced 41 percent fewer layoffs than in May, a report Thursday showed."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde67e\"", "article_summary": "Planned job cuts announced by U.S.-based businesses in June were at their lowest level yet of 2014, dropping 41 percent last month after reaching a 15-month high in May.\nWith 26,863 planned job cuts through June, retailers also experienced heavy downsizing.\nLast month there were 31,434 anticipated job cuts announced; that\u2019s 20 percent lower than the same month a year ago, and much lower than May\u2019s 52,961 cuts, according to a report Thursday from Chicago-based outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, Inc.\n\u201cThe holidays were not kind to several retailers who answered with heavy layoffs in the first quarter,\u201d said John Challenger, CEO of Challenger, Gray & Christmas.\n\u201cWe saw large scale job cut announcements from Macy\u2019s, Best Buy, J.C.
