I believe that this is a key reason that many Americans are opposed, wrongly in my opinion, to the Affordable Care Act.\n\nVietnam turned a whole generation sour on government. My brother went over a Goldwater conservative and returned as an anarchist war protester. But we did not learn. The Iraq war was totally unnecessary and cost thousands of American lives and will eventually cost trillions of dollars. It\u2019s not hard to understand why Americans are skeptical of unilateral intervention in Syria.\n\nOther more recent government actions have bred public mistrust. For example, very little was done by Congress to control Wall Street after the economic collapse in 2008. Many called for charges to be brought against financial criminals and stricter banking laws to prevent a future meltdown. What they got was a watered down, ineffective Dodd-Frank Act.\n\nPhoto\n\nI could cite many other examples, including Watergate and the current Congressional impasse that led to a government shutdown. The point is that Americans are generally fed up with what they see as government incompetence and lying.\n\nIn my view, this is why Americans do not believe that the Affordable Care Act is being enacted to help them. They have been told time and time again that government actions are in their interests, only to find out that they are not.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nUnfortunately, this time the program in question addresses a real problem, lack of insurance. But the public will not listen.\n\nJACK BERNARD\n\nMonticello, Ga., Oct. 1, 2013\n\nThe writer is a retired health care executive and former Republican Party chairman of Jasper County.\n\nEditors\u2019 Note: We invite readers to respond briefly by Thursday for the Sunday Dialogue.
