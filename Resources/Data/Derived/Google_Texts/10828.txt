Re: “Denver Museum of Nature & Science balances tradition, technology,” June 25 business news story.

I loved the photo of the young visitor to the Denver Museum of Nature & Science, which caught him in midair, totally enchanted with the digital projection game on the floor of the Bear and Sea Mammals Hall.

However, the two ignored bears in the old diorama behind the child seem melancholy — no doubt wondering if they are doomed to extinction by the museum in the not-so-distant future.

I canceled my museum membership after realizing that the sanctuary of learning, which four generations of my family had come to love, had evolved into an indoor amusement arcade, designed for noisy fun. Many out-of-state visitors come to Denver specifically to see some of the best wildlife dioramas in the nation.

Though I appreciate computer games and technological advances in the museum world, I believe that history is important, and this includes the continued preservation of the actual animal specimens that Denver is so fortunate to possess.
