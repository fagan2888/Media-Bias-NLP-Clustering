Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal. Lyndon B. Johnson severed that bond when he committed his noblest deed in signing the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964. \u201cI think we\u2019ve just delivered the South to the Republican Party for the rest of my life and yours,\u201d Johnson told his aide Bill Moyers.\n\nJacob Weisberg Jacob Weisberg is chairman and editor-in-chief of The Slate Group and author of The Bush Tragedy. Follow him on Twitter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nGeorge Wallace, the segregationist governor of Alabama, began fulfilling Johnson\u2019s prophecy when he led Southern whites out of the Democratic Party. Wallace formed the American Independent Party, which took five Southern states and helped deliver the White House to Richard Nixon in 1968\u2014incidentally, the last time a third party carried any state in a U.S. presidential election. Wallace\u2019s Southern voters and their Northern brethren increasingly supported Republicans thereafter, becoming a pillar of the Reagan coalition in the 1980s.\n\nNow a version of that old split has emerged on the right. The Reagan Democrats have become the Trump Republicans, and signs point once again to a breach with the party they have reflexively supported for decades. At one level, the cause is the same as in 1964: reaction against social change that has eroded the value of white privilege. But at another level, this is a revolt by Republican voters who no longer believe that their party supports their basic economic interests. While the leader of this rebellion is one of the rankest opportunists ever to appear on the American political scene, the white working class\u2019s feeling that it has been seduced and abandoned by the GOP is perfectly justified.\n\nThe revolt of the Republican masses bears out the thesis of Thomas Frank\u2019s 2004 book What\u2019s the Matter with Kansas? Non-college\u2013educated whites have been suffering from an epidemic of false consciousness that took hold during the Reagan Era. While their self-interest aligned with Democratic policies designed to help insulate the vulnerable from economic transition, Republicans managed to persuade working-class voters to support the very policies that were doing them harm. They accomplished this by diverting the attention of less-educated whites with coded racial appeals, emphasizing cultural issues like abortion and gay rights, and stirring resentment against liberal \u201celites.\u201d (It should be noted that not everyone buys this thesis.)\n\nPeople who agree on next to nothing can\u2019t go on cohabiting indefinitely.\n\nWorking-class Republicans are waking up to the reality that their new party doesn\u2019t represent them any more than the Democrats did. On issue after issue, Trump\u2019s supporters are at odds with GOP dogma. They don\u2019t support free trade and globalization. They don\u2019t favor tax cuts for the wealthy, or bailouts for banks, or financial deregulation, or the rollback of consumer protections. They\u2019re against privatizing Social Security, paring back Medicare, and eliminating other government programs that aid the middle class. While they\u2019ve been encouraged to regard Barack Obama as an extraterrestrial, they\u2019re not demanding the repeal of the Affordable Care Act. Though nationalistic, their families are the ones that paid the human cost for the neoconservative fantasy of bringing democracy to Iraq.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nWith his real estate developer\u2019s nose for opportunity, Donald Trump has bought up the swampy property between Republican leaders and the Republican led. His most effective line of attack is against sensible immigration reform, which the party\u2019s donor class supports and its constituent base rejects. Trump\u2019s voters couldn\u2019t care less about bringing Latinos into the GOP. But his rallying cry of \u201cbuild the wall and make them pay for it\u201d isn\u2019t just about nativism. It expresses a broader distress over the consequences of globalization, free trade, deindustrialization, and deunionization. Like William F. Buckley in the 1950s, Trump\u2019s supporters stand athwart economic change yelling, \u201cStop!\u201d\n\nIn this context, the rise of the Tea Party, circa 2009, now appears as red herring. Rank-and-file Republicans weren\u2019t in fact dismayed by George W. Bush\u2019s failure to shrink their entitlement benefits. It was the party\u2019s wealthy elite\u2014the Koch brothers and their beneficiaries at libertarian think tanks\u2014who were frustrated about that. Working-class Republicans were enraged because they saw the federal government bailing out Wall Street banks instead of ordinary citizens. The Tea Party quickly dissipated into irrelevancy because it didn\u2019t represent the people it claimed to represent.\n\nGranted the nomination, Trump will drive away the Republican elite in this year\u2019s election. Denied the nomination, he may lead the white working class out of the party for good, or clear the path for its slow-motion removal. But people who agree on next to nothing can\u2019t go on cohabiting indefinitely. It\u2019s impossible to say what form a Republican schism will end up taking. It could be an actual rupture at the Republican Convention in Cleveland, like South Carolina Gov. Strom Thurmond\u2019s Dixiecrat walkout from the 1948 Democratic Convention, with immigration as the new segregation. Or, if Republicans lose in November, we could see the emergence of a Trumpian third party. Or a populist faction could try to seize control of the GOP from within.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.subheadline": "The Tea Party was a red herring.
