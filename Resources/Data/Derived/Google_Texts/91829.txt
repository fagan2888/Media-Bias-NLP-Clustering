NEW YORK (AP) — LeBron James doesn’t take a single moment for granted. There’s no time to waste. Every game, every gesture is special.

The day approaches when he’ll no longer be considered the planet’s best player.

And as he prepared to play in his 12th NBA All-Star game — this one in Madison Square Garden, a place he holds dear — James reflected on his life and legacy during an interview Saturday with The Associated Press. Sitting in a classroom following the dedication of a basketball court at a Boys and Girls Club in Harlem refurbished by his family foundation, James said he’s in a good place.

Now 30, with slight traces of gray coursing through his beard, James is awed by the passing of time.

“It’s 12 years for me in the league now,” he said, shaking his head. “I remember like it was yesterday when I was headed to New York for draft night,” he said.
