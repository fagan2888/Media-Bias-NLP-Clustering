Those qualified organizations will also be allowed to provide or sell claims data to providers.\n\nThe rule also outlines strict privacy and security requirements for any entity receiving Medicare analysis or data. Additionally, there will be new annual reporting requirements.\n\n\"Increasing access to analyses and data that include Medicare data will make it easier for stakeholders throughout the healthcare system to make smarter and more informed healthcare decisions,\" said CMS Acting Administrator Andy Slavitt.\n\nThe qualified entity program, authorized by the Affordable Care Act, allows qualified organizations access to patient-protected Medicare data to produce public reports. Such entities must combine the Medicare data with other claims data, such as private payer data; this enables them to produce quality reports representative of how providers and suppliers are performing across multiple payers (Medicare or Medicaid, for example, or various commercial payers).\n\n[Like Healthcare IT News on Facebook]\n\nTo date, 13 organizations have applied for, and received, approval to be a qualified entity. Of these, two have completed public reporting. The other 11 are preparing for that.\n\nThe new rules, said CMS, aim to bolster the current qualified entity program, allowing for more innovating uses of Medicare data for non-public uses, while at the same time ensuring the privacy and security of beneficiary information.\n\nTwitter: @JELagasse", "article_metadata": {"description": "New rules are anticipated to allow organizations -- those approved as qualified entities -- to confidentially share or sell analyses of the data.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Healthcare IT News", "description": "New rules are anticipated to allow organizations -- those approved as qualified entities -- to confidentially share or sell analyses of the data.", "title": "CMS to share claims data with providers, employers to improve care", "url": "http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/cms-share-claims-data-providers-employers-improve-care", "image": "http://www.healthcareitnews.com/sites/default/files/HHS.png", "updated_time": "2016-02-01T10:36:19-05:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/cms-share-claims-data-providers-employers-improve-care", "image": {"src": "http://www.healthcareitnews.com/sites/default/files/HHS.png"}, "description": "New rules are anticipated to allow organizations -- those approved as qualified entities -- to confidentially share or sell analyses of the data.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "CMS to share claims data with providers, employers to improve care"}, "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-01T10:36:19-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-01T10:36:19-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The qualified entity program, authorized by the Affordable Care Act, allows qualified organizations access to patient-protected Medicare data to produce public reports.\nThose qualified organizations will also be allowed to provide or sell claims data to providers.\nSuch entities must combine the Medicare data with other claims data, such as private payer data; this enables them to produce quality reports representative of how providers and suppliers are performing across multiple payers (Medicare or Medicaid, for example, or various commercial payers).\nAs required by the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act, the new rules are anticipated to allow organizations -- those approved as qualified entities -- to confidentially share or sell analyses of Medicare and private sector claims data to providers, employers, and anyone else who can use that data to improve care.\n[Like Healthcare IT News on Facebook]To date, 13 organizations have applied for, and received, approval to be a qualified entity."}
