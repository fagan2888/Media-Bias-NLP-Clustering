U.S. signees included the American Civil Liberties Union and the Consumer Federation of America.\n\nThe so-called Privacy Shield agreement \u2014 which has yet to be approved by the EU\u2019s privacy regulators \u2014 replaces a 2000 pact that allowed over 4,000 U.S. companies to legally handle European citizens\u2019 data.\n\nIt was struck down by the European high court in October over privacy concerns, prompting a scramble from the U.S. and the European Commission to avoid a shutdown of transatlantic data transfers.\n\nThe text of the new deal was almost immediately attacked by privacy advocates for failing to satisfy the standards of the high court\u2019s ruling. Critics argue that the new draft is not viable because it still permits U.S. intelligence agencies to conduct \u201cmass surveillance\u201d of European citizens.\n\nThe new agreement \u201cmanifestly fails\u201d to meet a privacy standard that will satisfy regulators or the original ruling, the groups say, arguing that the U.S. government \u201ccontinues to deny the relevance and application of the internationally-accepted standards of necessity and proportionality in its surveillance operations.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn order for the Privacy Shield to survive, the U.S. must formally commit to substantial reforms to respect human rights and international law in order to meet the standards set forth by the [high court],\u201d Tuesday\u2019s letter reads.\n\nAs part of the agreement, the U.S. agreed to provide \u201cwritten assurances\u201d at the Cabinet level that place limits on the government\u2019s access to personal data for national security purposes.\n\nA multi-page letter from Robert Litt, the general counsel of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, said that the U.S. intelligence community \u201cdoes not engage in indiscriminate surveillance of anyone, including ordinary European citizens.\u201d\n\nThe European Commission has repeatedly backed up that assessment in its defense of the deal.\n\nBut in his letter, Litt described a carve-out in U.S. law that allows signals intelligence collected in bulk to be used for six national security purposes, including \u201cdetecting certain activities of foreign powers\u201d and counterterrorism efforts.\n\nThe privacy advocate who brought down the original agreement has already indicated that even if the new deal is approved, it will likely face legal challenges.\n\n\u201cThey tried to put ten layers of lipstick on a pig, but I doubt the Court and the [data protection authority regulators] now suddenly want to cuddle with it,\u201d Max Schrems of Austria said in a statement.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Signees came from both sides of the Atlantic.", "description": "Signees came from both sides of the Atlantic.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Katie Bo Williams", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Signees came from both sides of the Atlantic.", "title": "Privacy groups urge renegotiation of US-EU data agreement", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/273235-privacy-groups-urge-renegotiation-of-us-eu-data-agreement", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/eueuropeanunionflag_102715getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-03-16T12:47:55-04:00", "type": "article"}, "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-03-16T12:47-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/273235-privacy-groups-urge-renegotiation-of-us-eu-data-agreement", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2016-03-16T12:40-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Katie Bo Williams", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-16T12:40:44-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-16T12:47:55-04:00"}, "keywords": ",,", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/273235-privacy-groups-urge-renegotiation-of-us-eu-data-agreement", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Signees came from both sides of the Atlantic.", "card": "summary", "title": "Privacy groups urge renegotiation of US-EU data agreement"}, "dcterms.title": "Privacy groups urge renegotiation of US-EU data agreement"}, "article_summary": "The so-called Privacy Shield agreement \u2014 which has yet to be approved by the EU\u2019s privacy regulators \u2014 replaces a 2000 pact that allowed over 4,000 U.S. companies to legally handle European citizens\u2019 data.\nA group of privacy advocates and civil liberties organizations are urging European Union officials to reopen negotiations over a transatlantic data flow agreement struck last month.\nThe privacy advocate who brought down the original agreement has already indicated that even if the new deal is approved, it will likely face legal challenges.\nCritics argue that the new draft is not viable because it still permits U.S. intelligence agencies to conduct \u201cmass surveillance\u201d of European citizens.\nThe text of the new deal was almost immediately attacked by privacy advocates for failing to satisfy the standards of the high court\u2019s ruling."}
