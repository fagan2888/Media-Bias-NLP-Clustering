Early Voting in the state ended over the weekend. But, before it wrapped up, WUWF News caught up with a sampling of voters in Santa Rosa County.\n\n\u201cI voted for Donald Trump,\u201d said Pea Ridge resident Daniel Womack, who voted early at the Santa Supervisor of Elections Office on Saturday. He says \u2018beyond all the rhetoric and antics\u2019 he thinks Trump\u2019s message reflects what a lot of Americans are feeling.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important we get back to being a strong nation and we get back to being important world-wide. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re look at in the world as being respected anymore.\u201d\n\nWomack says he doesn\u2019t agree with Trump on every point, but does believe that the billionaire businessman has some good ideas regarding trade and immigration.\n\nMilton area residents Kathy and Larry Westendorf had similar thoughts, and also cast their votes for Trump.\n\n\u201cI think this country needs a change and he\u2019s a man that can get in there and get some things taken care of for us,\u201d said Kathy Westendorf. \u201cI think we need to become united as a nation. I think that our military needs support and I think he\u2019s gonna take care of that for us.\u201d\n\nRecent polls give Donald Trump a huge lead in Florida. A CBS News poll released over the weekend shows Trump with 44 percent of the vote, Cruz with 24 percent, and it drops Florida Senator Marco Rubio to third here in his home state, projecting 21% of the vote for him.\n\nRubio is struggling to stay in the race, and needs more people like Santa Rosa resident Gary White, in his corner.\n\n\u201cI voted for Marco Rubio,\u201d said White. \u201cI feel like he\u2019s probably got the calmer head of all the three remaining candidates. Cruz is a little bit too hyped up and I\u2019m not sure about Trump at all. The lesser of the evils I guess.\u201d\n\nWhite\u2019s omission of former Ohio Gov. John Kasich reflects the fact that Kasich is getting little traction among Republicans in Florida, where all 99 delegates will go to the winner.\n\nOn the Democratic side, Florida has 246 delegates that will be awarded on a proportional basis.\n\nIn the Sunshine State, Hillary Clinton is expected to win big. And, in Santa Rosa, she got the early votes of hair stylist Susie Crenshaw and construction worker Patrick Ellis.\n\n\u201cI like what she\u2019s talking about,\u201d Crenshaw said. \u201cI love the fact that she\u2019s a woman running for president and would be the first one. So, that would make history as well.\u201d\n\nAccording to Ellis, \u201cshe got secretary of state and got a lot of experience and I like that.\u201d Ellis adds that he always supported the Clintons and likes that Mrs. Clinton backs President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act.\n\nAnother Democrat casting an early vote in Santa Rosa was 70 year old Norma Sledge of Milton, who is a retired Department of Defense worker. The Mississippi native declined to say who she voted for, adding that her vote as an African American Democrat should NOT be taken for granted.\n\n\u201cIt seems like Sen. Clinton wants to take every Black vote for a given, a gift; I don\u2019t like that,\u201d said Sledge, referring to the fact that Clinton is speaking out on issues, such as racial injustice, that she did not talk about 20 years ago.\n\nSledge also expressed concern that the nation\u2019s growing political discourse will create the kind of racially divisive atmosphere that existed in the 1960\u2019s. And, she says some of what the Republicans are saying just doesn\u2019t add up.\n\n\u201cI have a problem with Cruz. Cruz says he\u2019s a Christian. Yet and still, he wants to kill every ISIS person;\n\nwomen, children, boy, girl dog and everything else. I have a problem with that.\u201d\n\nRev. Jimmy Blank, a Republican who cast his vote last week at the Pace Community Center, has a different view.\n\n\u201cI voted for Sen. Ted Cruz,\u201d said Blank, who is a non-denominational pastor of Family of Faith Fellowship Ministries international and a former postal worker.\n\n\u201cI found it important to cast my vote today for the candidate I think best represents my values as a follow of Jesus Christ and who also will help to maintain Godly accountability as a president and a leader.\u201d\n\nBlank is a native of Hackensack, New Jersey, and originally supported Chris Christy. He now thinks Christy would make a great vice president.\n\nAnd, while Cruz got his primary vote, he like most others who spoke to WUWF, plans to support whoever wins his party\u2019s nomination in the General Election in November.\n\n\u201cI do not want to see the Democratic candidates again in the White House. I think we\u2019ve had enough now,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the case of Navy Lt. Cmdr Daniel Marcus, who also voted at the Pace Community Center, he could not talk specifics. But, given his travels as an active duty serviceman, he highlighted the importance of just taking part in the election process.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019re countries that I\u2019ve been deployed to and they don\u2019t have that right, and they\u2019re hungry for that right and fighting for it,\u201d said Marcus, adding that just voicing your opinion in those countries could get a person killed or put their families in harm\u2019s way. \u201cEverybody needs to vote.\u201d\n\nIf you haven\u2019t yet voted, there\u2019s one last chance. The polls will be open on this Election Day from 7am to 7pm.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Local Politics", "description": "The last round of voting in Florida\u2019s Presidential Preference Primary is set for this Tuesday, Mar. 15.
