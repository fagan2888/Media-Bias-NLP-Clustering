But they also go a long way toward explaining the fundamental divide between Republicans and Democrats today \u2014 and the contours of the election campaign to come.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFirst, and most obvious, is the demographic divide.\n\nIf there is one thing missing from Clinton\u2019s announcement video, it\u2019s white men. Of course, I\u2019m exaggerating. The video, after all, does show two white men . . . holding hands and talking about their impending marriage.\n\nThere\u2019s also a young Asian female college graduate, a single mom, two Hispanic entrepreneurs (speaking Spanish, no less), an African-American couple excitedly awaiting a first child, a lesbian couple, an interracial couple, and lots and lots of women. Thirty years ago, Jesse Jackson talked about a Rainbow Coalition; today, that coalition is powerful enough to be worthy of naked political pandering.\n\nThen again, pandering is really just another word for a pragmatic understanding of the changing American electorate. In 2012, Barack Obama lost white voters by 20 points to Mitt Romney. Yet he still won the election by a fairly comfortable 4-point margin.\n\nHe did so by winning 93 percent of the African-American vote, 71 percent of the Hispanic vote, and a majority of female voters. That coalition amounted to nearly a quarter of the electorate. By 2016, it will likely be even larger. Obama dominated among voters in their teens and 20s, female voters, and voters making less than $50,000. These are the sources of Democratic strength on the presidential level. It\u2019s why Clinton\u2019s campaign video looked like a Benetton ad \u2014 and why its most discernible message was that she would be a \u201cchampion\u201d for \u201ceveryday Americans.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat leads to the other clear dividing line \u2014 the choice of populist bogeyman. In Clinton\u2019s vernacular, \u201cthe deck is still stacked in favor of those at the top,\u201d which is a rather obvious reference to Wall Street and the proverbial 1 percent.\n\nFor Ted Cruz, \u201cthe real divide\u201d in America is between Washington and the rest of us. For Rand Paul, it\u2019s the people versus the \u201ccareer politicians,\u201d failed \u201cliberal policies,\u201d and \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d that emanates from Washington.\n\nWe already saw these battle lines in 2012, but if the first few weeks of campaign 2016 are any indication, this election is going to be all about antigovernment populism versus old-fashioned economic populism.\n\nNowhere is this division more starkly drawn than in the issues Clinton, Paul, and Cruz chose to highlight. Clinton\u2019s video is heavy on symbolism, but clearly hints at social issues like gay marriage and immigration. It references early childhood education and the challenges faced by working parents, retirees, recent college grads, and budding entrepreneurs. What\u2019s even more interesting is what goes unmentioned: The former secretary of state has nothing to say about foreign policy.\n\nThe Republicans touch on world affairs, but in ways clearly targeted at conservative voters; there\u2019s a brief shot of Cruz shaking hands with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. What they don\u2019t present is a positive agenda for governing, outside the vaguest of platitudes. \u201cI believe we can stand up and restore our promise,\u201d Cruz says.\n\nPaul talks about imposing term limits on Congress and forcing members to \u201cread every bill.\u201d He throws out some conservative economic chestnuts, such as balancing the budget and creating a \u201csimple, fair\u201d tax system.\n\nCruz\u2019s focus is equally guaranteed to set Republican hearts aflutter. He dwells on his \u201chistoric battle\u201d to defund Obamacare, his efforts to take on the IRS, and his fight against both a debt limit increase and President Obama\u2019s \u201cillegal and unconstitutional amnesty.\u201d\n\nThirty years ago, Jesse Jackson talked about a Rainbow Coalition; today, that coalition is powerful enough to be worthy of naked political pandering.\n\nThat creates the final irony of the 2016 race so far. Clinton, the former member of the Obama administration, would seem likely to be the politician most caught in the president\u2019s shadow.\n\nBut if anything, it\u2019s the Republicans who are still fighting the same old fights.\n\nMichael A.
