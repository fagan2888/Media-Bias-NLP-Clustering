We\u2019ve got to make sure as taxpayers we spend our dollars well,\u201d Scott says. \u201cSo, in my budget this year we have a proposal \u2014 the way LIP funding will go \u2014 will go to the hospitals that need the money most \u2014 our safety net hospitals, our teaching hospitals.\u201d\n\nScott\u2019s also calling for doing away with automatic Medicaid payments to hospitals to cut costs, but isn't diverting any state funds to make LIP whole. In an emailed statement, Florida Hospital Association President Bruce Rueben instead says the governor should focus on expanding Medicaid coverage.\n\n\u201cLow Income Pool funding reductions only underscore the need for a long-term solution to address the high number of uninsured individuals in Florida,\u201d Rueben wrote.\n\nAlthough he\u2019s a former HCA executive himself, for-profit hospitals have been on the receiving end of criticism from Governor Scott, who\u2019s accused big hospital chains of price gouging patients.\n\nScott\u2019s now asking the Legislature for $5 million to establish an All Payer Claims Database. Scott says the website would allow patients, caregivers and insurance companies to keep track of hospital expenses, costs and coverage.\n\n\u201cEvery hospital will post their prices through our Agency for Health Care Administration so we won\u2019t see the price gouging,\u201d Scott says. \u201cPeople will know exactly what they\u2019re being charged before they make the decision to get any health care services.\u201d\n\nEarlier in November some Jacksonville patients met with the governor to tell him about how they\u2019d been taken advantage of by for-profit hospitals. Scott said he wanted lawmakers to implement recommendations from his Commission on Health Care.\n\nAt the time, the Hospital Association\u2019s Bruce Rueben said Scott\u2019s proposal amounted to \u201cprice capping.\" Scott said if a procedure exceeds the hospital's average price on the database, the state would level penalties. Instead, Rueben called on Scott to implement an All Payer Claims Database like Virginia and Colorado have, which are largely for information purposes only.\n\n\u201cWe have long-supported the creation of an All Payer Claims Database (APCD),\u201d Rueben wrote. \u201cIt will help individuals, businesses and policymakers better understand what is driving Florida\u2019s health care costs.\u201d\n\nBut it appears Scott beat Florida hospitals to the punch. If the governor has his way, hospitals would be penalized by the state if their prices exceed the average posted to the database.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "Florida Governor Rick Scott is asking the Legislature to pass a $79.3 billion state budget next year.
