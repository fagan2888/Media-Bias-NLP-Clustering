Iran is the world\u2019s leading state sponsor of terrorism. That means billions of dollars will go to Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis.\u201d\n\nThe deal between Iran and the Obama administration has come under a barrage of criticism on various fronts. Lawmakers are especially critical when it comes to the provision of lifting the economic sanctions against Iran. \u201cWe will be allowing American dollars to go to jihadists who will use our money to murder Americans, to murder Israelis, to murder Europeans,\u201d Cruz says.\n\nCongress is set to weigh in on the deal in the next two months, but already the Obama administration has taken the deal\u2019s framework to the United Nations for approval, infuriating lawmakers on both sides of the aisle.\n\nCruz believes that the deal has the word \u201ccatastrophe\u201d written all over it, and America could very well pay the price.\n\n\u201cThis deal, if it goes through, will accelerate Iran acquiring nuclear weapons. It allows them to keep all 19,000 centrifuges, keep many of them spinning, keep much of the enriched uranium, keep developing ICBMs, and the ICBMs, the sole purpose of them is to carry a nuclear warhead to the United States of America. You don\u2019t need a warhead to get to Israel. The only purpose of an ICBM is to cross the Atlantic and get to America.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ted Cruz says if the nuclear weapons deal with Iran goes through, the White House will become directly responsible for supporting terrorism.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Ted Cruz says if the nuclear weapons deal with Iran goes through, the White House will become directly responsible for supporting terrorism.", "title": "Cruz: Under Iran Deal, Jihadists Will 'Murder Americans'", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/TedCruz_Screenshot.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-07-22T23:51:44+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1LDFZY4"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Ted Cruz says if the nuclear weapons deal with Iran goes through, the White House will become directly responsible for supporting terrorism.", "title": "Cruz: Under Iran Deal, Jihadists Will 'Murder Americans'", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/TedCruz_Screenshot.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Security", "tag": "iran", "published_time": "2015-07-22T15:21:24+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-22T23:51:44+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Ted Cruz, Iran, nuclear deal, 2016, terrorism"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWe will be allowing American dollars to go to jihadists who will use our money to murder Americans, to murder Israelis, to murder Europeans,\u201d Cruz says.\n\u201cThe Obama administration will become the world\u2019s leading financier of radical Islamic terrorism,\u201d Cruz tells The Daily Signal.\nThat means billions of dollars will go to Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis.\u201dThe deal between Iran and the Obama administration has come under a barrage of criticism on various fronts.\nGOP presidential candidate Ted Cruz says if the nuclear weapons deal with Iran goes through, the White House will become directly responsible for supporting terrorism around the globe.\n\u201cThis deal, if it goes through, will accelerate Iran acquiring nuclear weapons."}
