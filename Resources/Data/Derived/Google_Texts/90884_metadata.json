And the field of Republican candidates who are testing waters, to various degrees, stands in the double digits.\n\nHow to choose wisely?\n\nAs tempting as an \u201canybody but Obama\u201d mentality might seem, the better rationale \u2013 the one that could very well prove the solution to this nation\u2019s political ills \u2013 is to consider first and foremost: God.\n\nThat\u2019s an odious idea to many, and not just atheists. Plenty of believers still don\u2019t think religion and politics mix; plenty would argue that religion belongs in church and politicians have no business bringing, say, the Bible into their public offices.\n\nBut we\u2019re not talking Bible-thumping here. It\u2019s not about preaching the word of God \u2013 it\u2019s about living it. It\u2019s about abiding age-old moral precepts and values that don\u2019t change with the times \u2013 that have been set in stone by a higher authority \u2013 and that teach generation upon generation such ideals as thou shalt not steal, thou shalt not commit false witness; thou shalt not covet.\n\nOr, how about the godly teachings of remaining humble, and putting service to others above service to self?\n\nThose are qualities and traits that are in dire need on Capitol Hill. Just look at the current White House makeup: Would a president who abided by the biblical teaching against lying tell an American public that Obamacare wouldn\u2019t change their doctor?\n\nWould a president who actually put service to constituents above the quest for legacy even have shoved Obamacare into law \u2014 or continued to shove it despite the many start-up fails \u2013 and dismissed all the poor poll showings and numerous legislative attempts at repeal?\n\nFirst and foremost, the next president needs to hold himself \u2013 or herself \u2013 accountable to a higher authority. Why? Because we certainly can\u2019t rein in a runaway president; just look at Barack Obama and his many executive abuses. We need a leader who has the moral maturity and humility of spirit to self-monitor and re-direct as prayerfully prompted.\n\nThis is not a new notion for U.S. politicians. One of America\u2019s most iconic images is of George Washington, on bended knee at Valley Forge, in an act of humble prayer.\n\nThe idea of a higher authority guiding our nation\u2019s government has been rooted in our system from the start. As most Founding Fathers agreed: The fate of the nation\u2019s freedom rested in the morality of the people.\n\nJohn Adams: \u201cOur Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other.\u201d\n\nFisher Ames: \u201cOur liberty depends on our education, our law, and habits \u2026 it is founded on morals and religion.\u201d\n\nPatrick Henry: \u201cBad men cannot make good citizens. It is when a people forget God that tyrants forge their chains. A vitiated state of morals, a corrupted public conscience, is incompatible with freedom. No free government, or the blessings of liberty, can be preserved to any people but by a firm adherence to justice, moderation, temperance, frugality, and virtue.\u201d\n\nGood morals, virtuous beliefs, as defined by God \u2013 these are the traits we need to look for first in our nation\u2019s presidents. Secondary are their public policy platforms. For a quick cheat-sheet at the polls, just remember this: \u201cBad men cannot make good citizens,\u201d and sub in the word \u201cleaders\u201d for \u201ccitizens.\u201d\n\nPoliticians who don\u2019t live by a higher moral code and hold themselves accountable to an omnipresent authority \u2013 whether Democrat or Republican \u2013 are a dime a dozen already. Why should we elect more?\n\nCheryl K.
