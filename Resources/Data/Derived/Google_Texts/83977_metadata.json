The president accepted, sparking a rather fierce outcry from Obama\u2019s conservative Catholic critics \u2013 including 83 U.S. Catholic bishops who publicly denounced the president\u2019s appearance, largely because of his support for reproductive rights.\n\nObama hadn\u2019t intended to discuss abortion right during his address, but in light of the uproar, he decided to \u201cdevote most of his address to bridging the chasm over abortion and other moral issues.\u201d By some accounts , the president was \u201cenergized by the controversy\u201d and addressed the debate over abortion \u201cwith relish.\u201d\n\nSeven years later, Vice President Biden may have a related opportunity. The Dallas Morning News reported this week that Vice President Biden will receive the 2016 Laetare Medal, described by Notre Dame as \u201cthe oldest and most prestigious honor accorded to American Catholics.\u201d\n\nMany conservative Catholics are up in arms because the University of Notre Dame is presenting its highest award to Vice President Joe Biden, a supporter of abortion rights. [\u2026] \u201cNotre Dame has once again chosen to betray the church and its Catholic mission,\u201d seethed an online commentary from the Cardinal Newman Society, a conservative Catholic group. By honoring Biden, \u201ca Catholic who unrepentantly and publicly opposes Catholic moral teaching.\u201d Notre Dame is creating \u201ca toxic religious environment on \u2026 campus and in the broader public,\u201d the society said.\n\nApparently, it\u2019s not just reproductive rights \u2013 the complaint also mentioned Biden\u2019s support for marriage equality and other \u201cintrinsic evils.\u201d\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, Biden will receive the honor at the same time as former House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), whose occasional disagreements with his church appear to be the basis for no controversy whatsoever.\n\nAlso from the God Machine this week:\n\n* The New York Times reported this week on some Americans joining health care sharing ministries, which require members \u201cto help cover one another\u2019s major medical costs as they come up.\u201d The article explained , \u201cWhile such nonprofit ministries have been around for decades, interest in them has grown since the Affordable Care Act passed in 2010, largely because the law exempts members from the requirement to have health insurance or pay a yearly fine.\u201d\n\n* A controversy worth watching: \u201cThe mayor of Virginia\u2019s capital city stands accused of diverting city resources toward the church he heads, and he seems to think he can violate the First Amendment while simultaneously claiming that the Constitution shields him from punishment.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "In 2009, President Obama's appearance at Notre Dame sparked a controversy among his conservative Catholic critics.
