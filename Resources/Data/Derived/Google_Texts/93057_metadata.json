Variety reported on its surprisingly successfully opening weekend:\n\n\u2018Divergent\u2019 Dominates With $22.8 Million Friday, \u2018God\u2019s Not Dead\u2019 Surprises at No. 3 \u201cDespite \u201cDivergent\u201ds box office domination, the surprise winner this weekend is \u201cGod\u2019s Not Dead.\u201d The low-budget faith-based film earned $2.8 million on Friday at 780 locations, putting it on track for an $8.5 million weekend. With a per-screen average of $3,590, the pic, which includes cameos from \u201cDuck Dynasty\u2019s\u201d Willie and Korie Robertson, clearly appeals to underserved faith-based audiences.\u201d\n\n\u201cGod\u2019s Not Dead\u201d delivered an answer for Christian audiences who were seeking some quality and family-friendly entertainment in the theater. The film followed a young Christian student who challenged his atheist teacher to examine his lack of faith \u2013 a raw and emotional story that really translated with viewers. Now, Pure Flix Entertainment is currently wrapping up production for the Little Film That Could\u2019s sequel.\n\nLike its predecessor, \u201cGod\u2019s Not Dead 2: He\u2019s Surely Alive\u201d exposes academic hostility to Christianity. It\u2019s a spotlight today\u2019s media is hesitant to shine, yet this film is not afraid to take on such a controversial issue. From the press release:\n\nGod\u2019s Not Dead 2 will have audiences standing unashamedly and firmly in their faith during a time when it seems increasingly unfavorable and divisive to do so in the public square\u2026 In a story that could easily be pulled from today\u2019s headlines, it\u2019s good to remember some things will always remain the same: \"God IS Surely Alive!\"\n\nThis time around, instead of just fighting for God in school, the main character is forced to defend her faith in court. Melissa Joan Hart (\u201cSabrina the Teenage Witch\u201d) stars as Grace Wesley, a teacher who is sued for daring to talk about Jesus in her classroom. After the school principal learns about Grace's religious dialogue with her students, she and a civil liberties group drag the Christian teacher to court.\n\nRounding out the cast are Jesse Metcalfe (\u201cDallas,\u201d \u201cDesperate Housewives\u201d) as Grace\u2019s lawyer, Fred Thompson (\u201cLaw & Order\u201d), Hayley Orrantia (\u201cThe Goldbergs\u201d), Robin Givens (\u201cHead of the Class\u201d) and even \u201cDuck Dynasty\u2019s\u201d Sadie Robertson.\n\nProducer David A. R. White, who helped produce both \u201cGod\u2019s Not Dead\u201d and \u201cGod\u2019s Not Dead 2,\u201d recurs his role as Reverend Dave in the sequel. He spoke with Townhall about his character\u2019s unique placement in the film.\n\n\u201cHe never feels he\u2019s being used by God,\u201d White said. \u201cHe feels like he\u2019s been put on a shelf. He is called for jury duty and ends up being a juror on the case. He\u2019s perfectly placed by God for a specific reason.\u201d\n\nWhite also shared how the story is relevant in today\u2019s culture, which is all too hostile to the Christian faith. For one example, he referenced the unnerving situation in Houston last year in which pastors' sermons were subpoenaed for their supposedly discriminatory messages.\n\n\u201cGod in schools is a very big thing today,\" White said. \"We\u2019re seeing it all over; it\u2019s being brought to the public light. I think these freedoms are. We want to bring some of these cases out. Even what happened in Houston, pastors having their sermons looked at by the court.\u201d\n\nIt is this kind of war on faith that the film will highlight. \u201cGod\u2019s Not Dead 2\u201d opens Easter 2016 and will be screened in over 2,000 theaters.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The sequel to the surprise faith-based box office success..05/25/2016 23:55:11PM EST.", "author": "Cortney O'Brien", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "The sequel to the surprise faith-based box office success.", "title": "Cortney O'Brien - Star-Studded \u2018God\u2019s Not Dead 2\u2019 Wrapping up Production, Will Expose an Academic War on Faith", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2015/07/08/starstudded-gods-not-dead-2-will-follow-a-teachers-battle-for-religious-liberty-n2022342", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2015/7/7/11.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "The sequel to the surprise faith-based box office success.", "title": "Cortney O'Brien - Star-Studded \u2018God\u2019s Not Dead 2\u2019 Wrapping up Production, Will Expose an Academic War on Faith", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2015/07/08/starstudded-gods-not-dead-2-will-follow-a-teachers-battle-for-religious-liberty-n2022342", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2015/7/7/11.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Star-Studded \u2018God\u2019s Not Dead 2\u2019 Wrapping up Production, Will Expose an Academic War on Faith , Cortney O'Brien, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf671\"", "article_summary": "Producer David A.
