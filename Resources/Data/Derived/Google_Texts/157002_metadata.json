Just as she had done with her first child, Eileen, who was then 39, opted out.\n\nBut when Eileen held Sadie in her arms for the first time after giving birth, she noticed something slightly different about her child when looking into her eyes. Sadie\u2019s eyes were puffy, and in her head, Eileen told herself that her newborn had Down Syndrome.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not to say that it wasn\u2019t emotional\u2014it was emotional at times. But we just adapted pretty well, I think,\u201d Eileen told The Daily Signal.\n\nWhen Sadie was an infant, Eileen stumbled upon a statistic that said 90 percent of babies with Down Syndrome are aborted.\n\nThat moved her to action.\n\nShe and another mother of a child with Down Syndrome, Leticia Velasquez, started the group Keeping Infants with Down Syndrome in 2008 to raise awareness about the abortion rate of babies with the disorder. They come to Washington, D.C., every year to participate in the March for Life.\n\n>>> 24 Signs Spotted at the March for Life\n\n\u201cWe really felt there needed to be a presence in the march for families who have children with special needs, and in our case Down Syndrome,\u201d Eileen said.\n\nAnd this year was no different.\n\nMore than 15 parents and their children traveled to Washington, D.C., this week to March with KIDS and the hundreds of thousands of other attendees.\n\nThough they, too, came from across the country, the families bonded with one another over their experiences with Down Syndrome. At the March, blue and yellow balloons traveled with the group as a symbol of their efforts to raise awareness about the disorder.\n\nMarch for Life attendees gathered yesterday in the shadow of the U.S. Capitol for the annual event. The gathering began as an answer to the U.S. Supreme Court case Roe v. Wade, and this year\u2019s event marked the 42nd time demonstrators made the 1.5-mile walk.\n\n\u201cPrenatal tests can tell you a lot. But it cannot tell you the love and the joy that child can bring to the community. There\u2019s just no test for that,\u201d says Eileen Haupt.\n\nStudents, teachers, nuns, priests and families from all corners of the country came together to march from the National Mall to the Supreme Court, calling for an end to abortion. Millennials donned signs proclaiming themselves the \u201cpro-life generation\u201d and mothers pushing strollers held others calling for an end to the procedure.\n\nFor parents struggling with whether to keep their baby after prenatal testing, Eileen has one piece of advice.\n\n\u201cPrenatal tests can tell you a lot,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it cannot tell you the love and the joy that child can bring to the community. There\u2019s just no test for that.\u201d\n\n>>> What Life Is Like at 20 Weeks in the Womb", "article_metadata": {"description": "For Eileen and Sadie Haupt, this year\u2019s March for Life, centered around the theme \u201cEvery Life is a Gift,\u201d held special meaning.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "For Eileen and Sadie Haupt, this year\u2019s March for Life, centered around the theme \u201cEvery Life is a Gift,\u201d held special meaning.", "title": "Why She Marched: A Mom\u2019s Story of Raising Her Daughter with Down Syndrome", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2015-01-23-at-12.27.54-PM.png", "updated_time": "2015-01-23T14:38:39+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1JhVItB"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "For Eileen and Sadie Haupt, this year\u2019s March for Life, centered around the theme \u201cEvery Life is a Gift,\u201d held special meaning.", "title": "Why She Marched: A Mom\u2019s Story of Raising Her Daughter with Down Syndrome", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2015-01-23-at-12.27.54-PM.png"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "Protecting Life", "published_time": "2015-01-23T12:45:27+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-23T14:38:39+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "March for Life, Eileen Haupt, Sadie Haupt, Keeping Infants with Down Syndrome, James Lankford"}, "article_summary": "Just as she had done with her first child, Eileen, who was then 39, opted out.\nBut when Eileen held Sadie in her arms for the first time after giving birth, she noticed something slightly different about her child when looking into her eyes.\nWhen Sadie was an infant, Eileen stumbled upon a statistic that said 90 percent of babies with Down Syndrome are aborted.\nSadie\u2019s eyes were puffy, and in her head, Eileen told herself that her newborn had Down Syndrome.\nThough they, too, came from across the country, the families bonded with one another over their experiences with Down Syndrome."}
