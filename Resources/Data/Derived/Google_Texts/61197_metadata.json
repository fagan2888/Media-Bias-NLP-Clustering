In 2006, he defeated Republican opponent and fellow council member Chris Merdon to succeed departing Democratic executive Jim Robey. In 2010, he coasted to easy re-election, defeating challenger Trent Kittleman with 62 percent of the vote.\n\nIn his final state of the county speech earlier this year, Ulman, who is term-limited, reflected that running for county executive as a one-term, 32-year-old councilman was a move that some must have considered audacious.\n\nBut looking back on his eight years in Howard's top job, his self-assessment was that he leaves the county a better place.\n\n\"The state of Howard County is accelerating and strong, forward-focused and vibrant, healthy and nimble, and poised for future success,\" he said.\n\nUlman's two terms as executive have been marked by progress on development in downtown Columbia as well as progressive policies that have sometimes attracted national attention.\n\nUlman's initiatives include Healthy Howard, a nonprofit partially funded by the county to provide access to health services for Howard's uninsured population before the Affordable Care Act was implemented; and, more recently, the Roving Radish, a food truck that is set to start delivering meal ingredients sourced from local farms to participants this July.\n\nHe also has played a leading role in coordinating the Inter-County Broadband Network, a project linking government buildings, schools and some businesses in the state to secure Internet access.\n\nWhen the county was thrust into the national spotlight after a double murder-suicide at the Mall in Columbia this January, Ulman was often filmed alongside Howard Police Chief William McMahon. His budget proposal in March included expanded funding for mental health resources and a task force to examine where the county can do better in its treatment of mental health issues.\n\nAs lieutenant governor, Ulman's role would not be well-defined. The state's Constitution says that the lieutenant governor, who is next in line to succeed the governor, \"shall have only the duties delegated to him by the Governor.\"\n\nPaul Herrnson, director of the Roper Center for Public Opinion Research at the University of Connecticut, said, 'The lieutenant governor generally plays a role a key adviser to the governor.\"\n\nHerrnson, a former University of Maryland professor who had Ulman in his class, described him in his student years as a \"very bright, hardworking person with a good ear for policy and politics.\" He said Ulman \"brings executive experience [to Annapolis] which Brown, as a state legislator, hasn't had.\"\n\nHerrnson also aid Brown and Ulman's success \u2014 and the fact that all the major Democratic candidates for governor this election cycle hailed from outside of Baltimore City \u2014 highlights the power of the Baltimore/Washington suburban electorate.\n\n\"I think the major point is the suburbs are now increasing in importance and Baltimore City is decreasing,\" Herrnson said.\n\nGuy Guzzone, a delegate from District 13 who sat on the council with Ulman in 2002, lauded the county executive for \"incredible talent for managing people and running government.\"\n\nAs lieutenant governor, Guzzone said, he can picture Ulman focusing on technological innovation, economic development and higher education to \"build infrastructure for the future in Maryland.\"", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Ulman clears first hurdle to State House", "Description": "Primary win is next step in 'audacious' career", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Unknown", "author": "Unknown", "og": {"site_name": "baltimoresun.com", "description": "Howard County Executive Ken Ulman cleared the first hurdle to the State House on Tuesday night, June 24, as he and gubernatorial running mate Anthony Brown clinched the Democratic nomination with about 50 percent of the vote, according to unofficial results.", "title": "Ulman clears first hurdle to State House", "url": "http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/howard/columbia/ph-ho-cf-ulman-primary-0626-20140625-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-53aa562b/turbine/ph-ho-cf-ulman-primary-0626-20140625", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp08.15", "twitter": {"site": "@baltimoresun", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index,follow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=496681035, app-argument=http://www.baltimoresun.com/deeplinkid/80627237", "fb": {"page_id": 9299179711, "app_id": 310302989040998}, "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2014-06-25", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "googlebot": "index"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcf55\"", "article_summary": "After just one term on the council, Ulman set his sights on the county executive post.\n\"The state of Howard County is accelerating and strong, forward-focused and vibrant, healthy and nimble, and poised for future success,\" he said.\nHoward County Executive Ken Ulman cleared the first hurdle to the State House on Tuesday night, June 24, as he and gubernatorial running mate Anthony Brown clinched the Democratic nomination with about 50 percent of the vote, according to unofficial results.\nIn 2006, he defeated Republican opponent and fellow council member Chris Merdon to succeed departing Democratic executive Jim Robey.\nAs lieutenant governor, Guzzone said, he can picture Ulman focusing on technological innovation, economic development and higher education to \"build infrastructure for the future in Maryland.\""}
