Hacktivists Anonymous are now targeting the two-party system in the US by casting more attention on Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein this week.

A new video from the collective states that, while they “support no political entity” and “can never be said to endorse a political candidate,” it “supports an informed public”.

The narrator in the video stresses the need for people to remember that there are more than just two parties and that it is important for voters to educate themselves on their options, name checking Jill Stein.

The video describes Stein as being “censored and ignored by the mainstream media, by Google, and by Twitter” and so the collective launched an online campaign to educate people about Stein.

“In the interest of avoiding mainstream media’s bias against third party candidates, we endorse the suggestion for a #OpJillStein,” the electronically-altered voice says.

The video also mentions an incident in 2012 which saw Stein arrested, handcuffed, and kept in a blacksite for eight hours when trying to enter a presidential debate at New York’s Hofstra University - something she alluded to during the 2016 campaign.

Why do #Greens routinely get arrested when we get anywhere near a debate? Because we're a real threat to the establishment. #LetJillDebate — Dr. Jill Stein (@DrJillStein) April 1, 2016

Stein and her running mate Cheri Honkala, as stated on Stein’s website, were “arrested and held incommunicado for eight hours in an undisclosed location, where we were handcuffed to metal chairs.”

Stein’s tweet was also a reference to this week’s arrest of Green Party US Senate candidate Dr Margaret Flowers in Maryland after she was refused a spot on stage.

Flowers, a single-payer healthcare advocate, has been an outspoken opponent of Obamacare from day one because of its failure to cover everyone.
