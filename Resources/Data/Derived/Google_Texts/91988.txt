Two people suspected in an armored vehicle heist in Amarillo, Texas, were arrested Wednesday night at a Colorado Springs hotel, police said.

Trent Michael Cook, the 24-year-old driver of the armored vehicle, was arrested along with an unnamed alleged accomplice on a warrant issued by the Amarillo Police Department, Colorado Springs police said in a release.

The $200,000 stolen in the robbery was recovered, the Amarillo Globe-News reported.

A SWAT team was used to apprehend Cook in his hotel room on the 2800 block of South Circle Drive because Texas officials believed he might be heavily armed and uncooperative.

Amarillo police contacted Colorado Springs police Tuesday seeking assistance in tracking down Cook. The armored car was found abandoned and running at about 8 a.m. Monday in Amarillo.

Colorado Springs police robbery detectives followed up on “rapidly developing leads” and located Cook and an alleged accomplice at the hotel, the release said. The accomplice was taken into custody before the SWAT team apprehended Cook.
