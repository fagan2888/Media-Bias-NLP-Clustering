Handout Jon Ralston (Photo: Handout)\n\nConsistency is the hobgoblin of lesser senators.\n\nThat appears to be the motto of Nevada\u2019s own Dean Heller, whose career of oscillation began as a moderate assemblyman, mutated to a maverick secretary of state, transformed to a sudden conservative (to beat Sharron Angle for Congress) and then, after prattling on about \u201canchor babies\u201d to win a seat in the Club of 100, shifted back to being a \u201cNo Labels\u201d kind of senator.\n\nSure, most politicians \u2013 heck, most humans \u2013 change over time, display inconsistencies, even hypocrisies. Heller has been more protean than most, though, with his most dramatic and convenient \u201cevolution\u201d in 2012 after his U.S. Senate victory. After months of sounding almost Trumpian in his immigration rhetoric, suddenly Heller was talking about being a bridge on reform, presaging his vote for the comprehensive bill in 2013.\n\nAll of this comes to mind after I obtained a recording of Heller\u2019s speech at the Atlantis last month to the Republican Women of Northern Nevada, which revealed not only just how, ahem, flexible he is but how he forgot one of the basic laws of modern politics: If you are speaking somewhere, someone probably is taping you (in this case, a Democratic tracker).\n\nIn pandering to this group, Heller not only rewrote history and distorted reality but distanced himself from measures, especially immigration reform, that he had previously supported. It was nothing short of a masterful con job that Trump couldn\u2019t have matched.\n\nLet me count the deceptions:\n\n\u2022Immigration reform: Heller went on a bizarre riff on the word \u201ccomprehensive,\u201d which made it sound as if someone spiked his lunch ice tea.\n\n\u201cEverything is comprehensive,\u201d Heller said. \u201cComprehensive tax reform. Comprehensive immigration reform. Comprehensive that, omnibus, CR, if you go down and it\u2019s huge and it is frustrating. Frankly, as a bunch of Republicans, we shouldn\u2019t like comprehensive. That isn\u2019t the way we work, or the way we think.\u201d\n\nExcept that was the way he thought three years ago, after getting his mind right on immigration reform or perhaps seeing that he lost Nevada\u2019s growing Hispanic cohort by a huge margin in 2012. He voted for the comprehensive bill, declaring at the time: \u201cI am pleased that both Democrats and Republicans were able to find ways to work together and pass legislation that this great nation deserves.\u201d\n\nShhh. Don\u2019t tell those GOP women who were at The Atlantis.\n\n\u2022Harry Reid and the Democrats: Heller also tried to take a swipe at Senate Minority Leader Reid, saying, \u201cAnd that\u2019s why Harry had such a big problem when he was in leadership. Every one of his bills started with the name \u2018comprehensive.\u2019 We knew if it said comprehensive, it was just a big government bill. We\u2019re not going to support a big government bill. So they try to get a 60-vote threshold, couldn\u2019t get it, \u2019cause every Republican would vote against anything that said \u2018comprehensive\u2019. Because that\u2019s just another word for big government.\u201d\n\nIt is? Heller was one of 68 senators to vote for immigration reform, the comprehensive one, the big government one, the one he said \u201cevery Republican would vote against.\u201d Hope none of those GOP ladies are reading this.\n\n\u2022Budget: Heller boasted to the group that the GOP Congress passed the first balanced budget since 2001 with many cuts.\n\n\u201cSo we finally passed a budget, and frankly to me, that\u2019s the most important thing Washington does,\u201d Heller told the women.\n\nIt is? Passing a non-binding outline of spending is the most important thing Congress does? I certainly hope not.\n\n\u2022The Culinary and the Obamacare excise tax: In September, Heller stood up at a news conference and proudly read a letter from Culinary Union leader D. Taylor about repealing a key part of the Affordable Health Care Act. He would soon absorb lots of praise from the Culinary.\n\nBut last month, he told the GOP women: \u201cIt was the first time I think I\u2019ve ever been on the same side as the Culinary Union, first time in 25 years of politics, we were actually out on the same side. Didn\u2019t feel good, just so you know. It didn\u2019t feel good.\u201d\n\nStrange, he didn\u2019t seem to be suffering at the time as he genuflected to the heavily Hispanic union.\n\n\u2022Taxes: Heller made a thoughtful statement on tax increases and cuts to the group, saying, \u201cIn 10 years in Washington, D.C., I\u2019ve never voted for a tax increase. If I get an opportunity to reduce your taxes, I don\u2019t care what\u2019s on the other side of it\u2026.\u201d\n\nThat makes sense. Oh, it\u2019s also not true. One obvious example: That bill to avoid the so-called fiscal cliff he voted for in 2013: That raised taxes.\n\n\u2022Ted Cruz: Heller, as is his specialty, was all over the map on Cruz. The senator told the group he votes with Cruz \u201c90 percent of the time. So we\u2019re pretty close.\u201d He also mentioned Cruz had called him for an endorsement, repeated how philosophically in tune they are but said he wouldn\u2019t embrace him because of his \u201cterrible track record\u201d on endorsements. (Can\u2019t argue there: Jeb Bush, then Marco Rubio.)\n\nThen, as the coup de grace, Heller also told the group Cruz had made the \u201cWashington cartel\u201d worse for his \u201cown personal gain ... just one example of many as to why he has very few friends.\u201d Any of you ladies supporting Cruz?\n\n\u200bI sought an explanation from Heller\u2019s press secretary, Neal Patel, and his chief of staff, Mac Abrams. As Phil Collins might say: No reply at all.\n\nThen again, what could they say?\n\nHeller also said during his speech that he is champing at the bit to take over for Reid as senior senator so he can pick federal judges.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you, I want nothing more than to be the senior senator from Nevada,\u201d Heller said.\n\nNothing more? If we believe him \u2013 and you can see that is a risky proposition \u2013 that means he doesn\u2019t want to come home in 2018, as some have speculated, and run for governor. Then again, maybe he\u2019ll change his mind.\n\nAgain.\n\nJon Ralston has been covering Nevada politics for more than a quarter-century.
