I was about 90 percent sure it was a melanoma and probably advanced. I instructed her to apply for the Affordable Care Act and do whatever it took to get insurance. I knew she would need surgery and possibly several operations and chemotherapy.\u201d\n\nThough it was past the open enrollment period in Nevada for the government- sponsored program, there was a good chance Rachel Palmer would still be able to get insurance under the act. Her move, which is considered \u201ca qualifying event,\u201d means there can be an exception to the normal protocol.\n\nShe visited Nevada Health Link\u2019s website and applied. A couple of days later, a staffer phoned her to give her a phone number to call to learn how she could get insurance.\n\nShe and her mother called the number at least 20 times with no success, generally getting a busy signal. When they did get through, they only could leave voice mails.\n\n\u201cI said I had melanoma,\u201d Rachel Palmer said, \u201cbut no one called me back.\u201d\n\nI called the number given the Palmers and also got busy signals. When I called Mary Woods, a spokeswoman for the Nevada Department of Health and Human Services, she acknowledged that Nevada Health Link, which has suffered many well-publicized problems, was having phone \u201cissues\u201d but said they should be cleared up by the end of the month.\n\n\u201cRachel and her mother tried for a week to get insurance through ACA,\u201d Petersen said. \u201cI could not let her wait.\u201d\n\nRachel Palmer was fortunate \u2014 incredibly fortunate that her mother made her an appointment with Petersen.\n\nIt turned out that the physician, who began Helping Hands Surgical Care, a nonprofit organization that has another half-dozen doctors performing surgeries at no cost to the uninsured, and the group had enough money left from fundraising in its coffers to cover facility and lab costs for an unexpected procedure.\n\nAs positive as that was, even more positive were the results from the operation Petersen performed. It appears, he said, that removal of the melanoma through a \u201cwide excision\u201d rid Palmer of her cancer and no further treatment is needed.\n\nThat good news, however, is tempered by Petersen.\n\n\u201cI consider this to be a nightmare scenario,\u201d he said. \u201cOther patients wouldn\u2019t be so lucky to have gone to someone who just happened to have a connection to a nonprofit organization. If her treatment was delayed \u2026 her cancer would have progressed to an incurable stage and she would have died within another year. How can this happen in America?\u201d\n\nIt repeatedly happens, said Dr. Dale Carrison, head of emergency and chief of staff at University Medical Center, because people, for one reason or another, don\u2019t know the best way to access the health care system.\n\nJust as Elizabeth Trujillo didn\u2019t last year. She was out of work and without insurance when she discovered small lumps in one of her breasts. Her contacts with people convinced her she had to have insurance before she could get help. By the time she got a job and her insurance kicked in, she was stage 4. The mother of three is now inoperable and praying for a miracle.\n\n\u201cEven though it wasn\u2019t technically an emergency, if she had come to the UMC emergency room she would have been referred to the surgical clinic and she would have gotten treatment,\u201d Carrison said, pointing out hospitals that help the uninsured have an incentive to defray costs by finding an appropriate assistance program for a patient.\n\nThe American Cancer Society also says it will help people find the resources for treatment.\n\n\u201cToo often, we see people in the emergency room when it\u2019s too late and then it costs even more,\u201d Carrison said.\n\nCarrison said it is also too often assumed that all people know how to use a computer in dealing with the health care system, and that people had one to sign up for the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cOne of the biggest problems we have in this community is helping people navigate the system,\u201d Carrison said.\n\nDr. Mitchell Forman, president of the Nevada State Medical Association, said the difficulty with navigating the health care system is not limited to Las Vegas. All across the country, he said, people have the same problem.\n\nTheoretically, he noted, the Affordable Care Act was supposed to do much to remedy the problem. But problems with the program\u2019s rollout, coupled with 25 states not opting into the program, have left millions without insurance.\n\n\u201cI promise I\u2019ll get some of the best minds together and see if we can\u2019t come up with a good way to help people navigate the system in Las Vegas,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have many good programs to help people who need it. They just need to know how.\u201d\n\nContact reporter Paul Harasim at pharasim@reviewjournal.com or 702-387-2908.", "article_metadata": {"parsely-link": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/columns-blogs/your-health/fortunate-moment-peril-persists", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "PAUL HARASIM LAS VEGAS REVIEW-JOURNAL", "parsely-title": "Fortunate moment, but peril persists", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/columns-blogs/your-health/fortunate-moment-peril-persists", "title": "Fortunate moment, but peril persists", "description": "It continues to happen.", "card": "summary", "creator": {"identifier": "@reviewjournal", "id": 15358759}}, "description": "It continues to happen.", "vf": {"unique_id": "reviewjournal-nid-1888591"}, "al": {"web": {"should_fallback": "true"}, "android": {"url": "review-journal://?eid=1510384", "app_name": "review-journal", "package": "com.LVRJ"}, "ios": {"url": "review-journal://?eid=1510384", "app_store_id": 540820524, "app_name": "review-journal"}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=540820524", "fb": {"admins": 630759385, "app_id": 195491203833571}, "google-play-app": "app-id=com.LVRJ", "og": {"site_name": "Las Vegas Review-Journal", "description": "It continues to happen.", "title": "Fortunate moment, but peril persists", "url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/columns-blogs/your-health/fortunate-moment-peril-persists", "image": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/defaultimage.jpg", "type": "article"}, "parsely-author": "PAUL HARASIM LAS VEGAS REVIEW-JOURNAL", "parsely-type": "post", "keywords": "Paul Harasim,Health, Life,", "parsely-section": "Blog_Paul Harasim", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-22T15:34:13-07:00"}, "parsely-tags": "Blog_Paul Harasim,Health,Life", "parsely-image-url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/defaultimage.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=0.9", "parsely-pub-date": "2014-06-22T22:34:13Z"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbf5b\"", "article_summary": "Theoretically, he noted, the Affordable Care Act was supposed to do much to remedy the problem.\n\u201cI could not let her wait.\u201dRachel Palmer was fortunate \u2014 incredibly fortunate that her mother made her an appointment with Petersen.\nI instructed her to apply for the Affordable Care Act and do whatever it took to get insurance.\nShe visited Nevada Health Link\u2019s website and applied.\nDr. Mitchell Forman, president of the Nevada State Medical Association, said the difficulty with navigating the health care system is not limited to Las Vegas."}
