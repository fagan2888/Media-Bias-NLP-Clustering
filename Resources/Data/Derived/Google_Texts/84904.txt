Bishop Lawrence Persico has received word that the Supreme Court case involving the Affordable Care Act and mandated contraception is moving back to circuit court where a resolution will be made.

"I'm very pleased" said Bishop Lawrence Persico "I think it is moving in the right direction for us and I am very optimistic about its outcome."

The Supreme Court was not able to come to a decision, which was made even more difficult with the passing of Justice Scalia.

In turn, the case has been passed down to the lower courts for settlement.

"They were very very fearful that it would end up in a 4 4 ruling" said Attorney Gery Nietupski "which wouldn't do anyone any good and that is after Justice Scalia passing."

The Diocese challenging the requirement that all organizations provide contraception coverage to employees.

The government allowing an exception for churches however, that does not include catholic work places.

"The Diocese of Erie and the Catholic Church is not opposed to universal health care" said Bishop Persico "but we want to make sure our religious freedoms are protected."

It is now in the hands of the lower courts to work out a deal and settle the case.

"The high court is hoping both sides will meet and reach some accord" said Nietupski "and not force them into some other judgment so, I think women will be protected and the church won't be affected in a negative way which i think is a win for both sides."
