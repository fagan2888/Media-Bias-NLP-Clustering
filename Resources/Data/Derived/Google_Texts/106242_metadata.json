Circuit. Pillard is an abortion backer whose nomination will likely face opposition from conservative Republicans in the Senate.\n\nPillard was nominated this summer to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and the Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing to question Pillard on the many controversial positions she holds on matters of constitutional interpretation. One believe she holds is that there is supposedly a right to an abortion in the Constitution.\n\nPillard argues that abortion is necessary to help \u201cfree women from historically routine conscription into maternity.\u201d\n\nShe has written, \u201cAntiabortion laws and other restraints on reproductive freedom not only enforce women\u2019s incubation of unwanted pregnancies, but also prescribe a \u201cvision of the woman\u2019s role\u201d as mother and caretaker of children in a way that is at odds with equal protection. Renewed attacks on abortion have turned attention to how the Equal Protection Clause, and the right to sex equality more generally, might advance reproductive self-determination.\u201d\n\nThe Obama judicial nominee also criticizes anyone opposed to the HHS abortion mandate in Obamacare as \u201creinforce[ing] broader patterns of discrimination against women as a class of presumptive breeders.\u201d\n\nTony Perkins of the Family Research Council responded to her pro-abortion views:\n\nA mother of two, Nina wrote a 2011 paper, \u201cAgainst the New Maternalism,\u201d which argues that by celebrating motherhood, society is creating a \u201cself-fulfilling cycle of discrimination.\u201d Those ideas bleed into Pillard\u2019s extreme pro-abortion views, which suggest that technology is somehow manipulating Americans to consider the personhood of the unborn. In one of her most jaw-dropping statements, the President\u2019s nominee even criticizes the ultrasound. She believes it manufactures \u201cdeceptive images of fetus-as-autonomous-being that the anti-choice movement has popularized since the advent of amniocentesis.\u201d As crazy and outrageous as her other comments are, this one is a denial of basic biology! She actually rejects modern science on human development because it conflicts with her hard-core ideology. If that doesn\u2019t disqualify someone from the second most prestigious court in America, I\u2019m not sure what does.\n\nPillard also thinks abstinence education is unconstitutional.\n\nPillard\u2019s visceral opposition to abstinence education, coupled with her copious misinformation on the subject, calls into question her fitness for the position. Under the banner of \u201csex equality\u201d she attempts to make a constitutional argument that abstinence education denies equal protection to female students.\n\nAccording to Pillard, abstinence education rises to the level of constitutional violation due to the fact that it is \u201cdesigned not only to expose students to ideas, but also to shape student behavior.\u201d*\n\n\u201cThe abstinence-only approach is permeated with stereotyped messages and sex-based double standards about acceptable male and female sexual behavior and appropriate social roles. Public school teaching of gender stereotypes violates the constitutional bar against sex stereotyping and is vulnerable to equal protection challenge,\u201d she has written.\n\nCLICK LIKE IF YOU\u2019RE PRO-LIFE!\n\nValerie Huber of the National Abstinence Education Association says it is difficult to exaggerate the extremist views of Cornelia Pillard and her group is calling on the Senate to reject the nominee.\n\nHuber tells LifeNews that Pillard blatantly distorts the manner in which abstinence programs share information and empower health behaviors and mischaracterizes the approach in her writings.\n\n\u201cHer spurious charge ignores the fact that abstinence education programs seek optimal heath outcomes for all students \u2013 male and female. She maligns an approach that explicitly advocates a single sexual standard, prides itself in empowering young men and women, and that promotes health and well being of the individual and society in general,\u201d Huber said. \u201cNAEA urges Congress and common-sense citizens to vigorously oppose a nominee who voices a total disregard for the facts about abstinence education and shows a frightening desire to aggressively use the Constitution to promote her radical ideological views.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Obama Pushes Pro-Abortion Nominee Nina Pillard for Second Most Powerful Court", "og": {"site_name": "LifeNews.com", "description": "President Barack Obama is pushing the nomination of Nina Pillard to the second most powerful court in the nation, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the D.C.", "title": "Obama Pushes Pro-Abortion Nominee Nina Pillard for Second Most Powerful Court", "url": "http://www.lifenews.com/2013/09/11/obama-pushes-pro-abortion-nominee-nina-pillard-for-second-most-powerful-court/", "image": "http://www.lifenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/pillard.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 204509779594999}, "OBKey": "avejq02j7xRr+0owuq+Pcw==", "keywords": "obama,abortion,nominee,nina pillard,court,pro-life,abstinence", "google-site-verification": "PPPx-GD0i7nWjUFAYnFdOYorAAJLuNyKOl23JCeXyrQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0b8e\"", "article_summary": "President Barack Obama is pushing the nomination of Nina Pillard to the second most powerful court in the nation, the U.S.\n\u201cHer spurious charge ignores the fact that abstinence education programs seek optimal heath outcomes for all students \u2013 male and female.\nPillard\u2019s visceral opposition to abstinence education, coupled with her copious misinformation on the subject, calls into question her fitness for the position.\nUnder the banner of \u201csex equality\u201d she attempts to make a constitutional argument that abstinence education denies equal protection to female students.\nPillard also thinks abstinence education is unconstitutional."}
