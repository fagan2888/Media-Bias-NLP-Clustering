I know for myself that when I get sick, I find it hard enough to read my favorite newspaper, much less haul myself in to work.\n\nThose of us who get annoyed at a sick worker\u2019s determination to come into work are not \u201cwhining\u201d; we are justifiably angry and concerned that the colleague\u2019s act is selfish and doesn\u2019t take other people into consideration.\n\nThere is a reason that doctors say to get plenty of bed rest when one is sick; that is the way to get better, not \u201cbeing a hero\u201d and insisting that you are well enough, despite your hacking, to work today.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn short, coming in sick to work displays a remarkable lack of responsibility.\n\nTRACEY BRAVERMAN\n\nBrooklyn, Dec. 30, 2014\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nJust when it seemed to me that workers were developing some notion that they should not expose others when they are sick, I was disappointed to see someone debunking office-worker \u201cquarantine\u201d as a public health measure. As an employer, I can attest that when a worker shows up coughing and sneezing, the entire office is sick within a few days as well.\n\nAnd those sick days that employers give? Well, generally the employees view them as additional personal days and hoard them for more rewarding activities.\n\nSURA JESELSOHN\n\nBronx, Dec. 30, 2014", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20150104185032, "twitter": {"description": "Two readers object to an Op-Ed column suggesting that fear of germs in the workplace is overhyped.", "title": "Coughing and Sneezing?
