The White House did confirm the breach earlier this month, saying it took place last year and that it did not affect classified information.\n\nThe Times notes that the president's email account itself and his encrypted Blackberry were apparently not hacked.\n\nOfficials did not disclose the number of Obama's emails that were read by the hackers.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#185f7c", "sailthru.author": "Reuters", "application-name": "Business Insider", "twitter": {"description": "The Russians learned some things about the commander in chief.", "title": "The most troubling thing about Russian hackers reading Obama's unclassified emails", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/r-russian-hackers-read-obamas-unclassified-emails-last-year-nyt-2015-4", "image": "http://static5.businessinsider.com/image/553cf38decad04ea68702274-506-253/the-most-troubling-thing-about-russian-hackers-reading-obamas-unclassified-emails.jpg", "creator": "MichaelBKelley", "site": "bi_contributors", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.verticals": "defense-contributor,main-contributor,defense,sai,politics,Reuters Internet", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "sailthru.tags": "Reuters Top News, Reuters Internet, Reuters US, Michael B Kelley, Reuters", "news_keywords": "Reuters Top News, Reuters Internet, Reuters US, Michael B Kelley, Reuters", "author": "Michael B Kelley and Reuters", "sailthru.date": "2015-04-26", "sailthru.title": "The most troubling thing about Russian hackers reading Obama's unclassified emails", "theme-color": "#185f7c", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/image/553cfc3becad041b0d702274-50-50/the-most-troubling-thing-about-russian-hackers-reading-obamas-unclassified-emails.jpg", "description": "The Russians learned some things about the commander in chief.", "tbi-image": "http://static2.businessinsider.com/image/553cfc3becad041b0d702274/the-most-troubling-thing-about-russian-hackers-reading-obamas-unclassified-emails.jpg", "fb": {"app_id": 155043519637}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/assets/images/us/favicons/mstile-144x144.png?v=BI-US-2016-03-31", "date": "2015-04-26", "article": {"publisher": "businessinsider", "author": "http://www.businessinsider.com/author/reuters"}, "sailthru.description": "The Russians learned some things about the commander in chief.", "viewport": "width=1024", "og": {"site_name": "Business Insider", "description": "The Russians learned some things about the commander in chief.", "title": "The most troubling thing about Russian hackers reading Obama's unclassified emails", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/r-russian-hackers-read-obamas-unclassified-emails-last-year-nyt-2015-4", "image": "http://static4.businessinsider.com/image/553cf38decad04ea68702274-1190-625/the-most-troubling-thing-about-russian-hackers-reading-obamas-unclassified-emails.jpg", "type": "article"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Business Insider", "title": "The most troubling thing about Russian hackers reading Obama's unclassified emails", "sailthru.image.full": "http://static2.businessinsider.com/image/553cfc3becad041b0d702274/the-most-troubling-thing-about-russian-hackers-reading-obamas-unclassified-emails.jpg", "tbi-vertical": "defense-contributor"}, "article_summary": "Russian hackers who penetrated sensitive parts of the White House computer system last year read President Barack Obama's unclassified emails, the New York Times reported on Saturday, quoting US officials.\nThe New York Times said the breach had been \"far more intrusive and worrisome than has been publicly acknowledged.\"\nOfficials did not disclose the number of Obama's emails that were read by the hackers.\nA White House spokeswoman declined to comment on the report.\nThe White House did confirm the breach earlier this month, saying it took place last year and that it did not affect classified information."}
