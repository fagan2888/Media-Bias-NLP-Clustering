BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) - A 33-year-old Bismarck man has been sentenced to 15 years in prison on a child pornography charge.

Preston Bushard is charged with receipt of materials involving the sexual exploitation of minors. He pleaded guilty on Feb. 3.

Authorities say Bushard downloaded child pornography from the Internet to his computer between January 2012 and August 2012.

Bushard has a previous conviction for possession of materials involving the sexual exploitation of minors.

U.S. District Judge Daniel Hovland says Bushard must serve 10 years of supervised release when he gets out of prison.
