ST. LOUIS (KMOX) – U.S. Sen. Claire McCaskill had two messages to share Thursday morning – one about her health after a recent breast cancer diagnosis, and the other regarding access to affordable healthcare.

The senator posted to her Facebook page, thanking followers for their outpouring of support.

“It’s easy to forget in the throes of a tough election year that, first and foremost, we have to look out for each other,” she writes. “So for you ladies: Please, please, please don’t forget to get your annual mammogram.”

She also speaks out against “petty and hateful bullying that’s dominating this election cycle.”

“Let’s keep standing up together against the loud voices calling to defund Planned Parenthood and repeal the Affordable Care Act. We need to be making it easier, not harder, for people to access truly lifesaving care.”

She ends her post by saying: “I’m ready to ‪#‎fightlikeagirl‬.”

McCaskill is in St. Louis receiving treatment. She says her prognosis is good and she expects a full recovery.
