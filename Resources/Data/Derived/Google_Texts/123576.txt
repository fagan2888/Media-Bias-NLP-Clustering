Ed Sheeran and Macklemore have previously combined to perform Macklemore & Ryan Lewis' gay-rights anthem "Same Love" live, and the pair did it again during Sheeran's iHeartRadio Music Festival set on Saturday night (Sept. 20). Watch the duet below:







Midway through Sheeran's five-song set, which featured the U.K. singer-songwriter and his guitar alone onstage, Macklemore bounced onstage in a leather jacket and began rapping the Top 20 hit from Macklemore & Ryan Lewis' The Heist. "Let me hear you, Vegas!" Macklemore called while Sheeran handled Mary Lambert's hook.

Along with "Same Love," Sheeran performed a mash-up of Chris Brown's "Loyal," Blackstreet's "No Diggity" and "Don't," the second single from his sophomore album, x. Sheeran also led the audience at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas in sing-alongs of "Thinking Out Loud," "The A Team" and Top 20 hit "Sing."



On Saturday afternoon, Macklemore made a surprise appearance during Fences' performance at the iHeartRadio Village to play their new collaboration, "Arrows." Earlier this year, Macklemore & Ryan Lewis defeated Sheeran for the best new artist trophy at the Grammy awards.
