The conference will be held July 10-14 in conjunction with the White House Tribal Youth Gathering on July 9.\n\nIn celebration of UNITY\u2019s 40th birthday next year, Nike N7 athletes and UNITY youth leaders will kick off a year-long fitness campaign. During the conference, nearly 1,500 youth and their chaperones will participate in various fitness activities while in Washington, D.C.\n\n\u201cN7 is our commitment to bring sport and all of its benefits to Native American and Aboriginal communities in the United States and Canada, with a focus on youth,\u201d said Sam McCracken, Nike N7 general manager, in a press release. \u201cBeyond promoting healthy and physically active lifestyle, sport helps build self-confidence and enables youth to be a force for positive change in their community. We believe that through activity, competition and play, Native American and Aboriginal youth can unleash the power of their generation and inspire the next.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are working with Nike N7 to create another memorable and special event to encourage Native youth to move and stay healthy not just at the conference, but all year long,\" said Mary Kim Titla, executive director of UNITY, Inc. \u201cIn 2011, UNITY promoted First Lady Michelle Obama\u2019s Let's Move in Indian Country initiative and this year UNITY was an early acceptor of President Barack Obama\u2019s Generation Indigenous Challenge, which Nike N7 also supports, so it makes sense to team up to promote fitness as our Native youth converge on our nation\u2019s capitol.\u201d\n\nRELATED: The White House Aims for Change With Gen-I Native Youth Challenge\n\nThe National UNITY Conference will be held July 10-14 at the Renaissance Washington, D.C.
