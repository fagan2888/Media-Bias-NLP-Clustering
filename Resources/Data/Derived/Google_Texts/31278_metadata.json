Orrin G. Hatch, the Utah Republican who is poised to become chairman of the Senate Committee on Finance next year. \u201cAmerican families have been doing more with less for far too long now, and it is time the IRS [does] the same.\u201d\n\nIRS bonuses have been contentious ever since the May 2013 revelation that the agency improperly targeted conservative groups\u2019 nonprofit status applications, including long delays and intrusive questions. Some groups are still awaiting approval nearly five years after they applied for nonprofit status.\n\nBut Mr. Koskinen said in an email to employees that the bonuses were an appropriate way for taxpayers to reward the agency that polices them.\n\nSEE ALSO: Federal judge tosses tea party suit seeking permanent protection from IRS targeting\n\n\u201cI believe that rewarding our high-performing employees is a vital investment for our nation\u2019s tax system,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Koskinen, who took over at the agency\u2019s helm to clean up after the tea party scandal erupted, said the agency has shed 13,000 staff positions since 2010 but has more duties than ever. One of those is administering Obamacare\u2019s tax penalty, which will show up in many tax filings early next year.\n\n\u201cPerformance awards are a good investment that pays off \u2014 and they reflect the hard work you and your colleagues do for the nation,\u201d he said.\n\nThe bonuses, which were first reported this week by The Hill, a newspaper that covers Congress, amount to about 1 percent of their salary for most employees. Several years ago employees got bonuses of 1.75 percent, but Mr. Koskinen said belt-tightening has hit hard.\n\nMr. Koskinen said he would take additional steps by denying bonuses for employees deemed to have violated the federal law\u2019s code of conduct for the IRS. That means workers who abuse taxpayers, falsify documents, engage in extortion, refuse to file their tax forms or are caught intentionally understating their taxes won\u2019t get bonuses. The law calls for them to be fired.\n\nHowever, hundreds of employees who are behind in their taxes but aren\u2019t deemed to have intentionally defrauded the government could still get bonuses, the agency confirmed to The Washington Times.\n\n\u201cIRS leadership determined that in cases of willful tax non-compliance, performance awards will not be paid to otherwise eligible employees. However, the law specifically excludes unintentional tax errors made due to a \u2018reasonable cause,\u2019 not to penalize employees for legitimate, unintended errors,\u201d the agency said in a statement. \u201cThe IRS monitors 100 percent of IRS employee tax accounts to identify acts of potential non-compliance and works with employees to ensure prompt payment.\u201d\n\nThe agency said more than 99 percent of its employees file and pay their taxes on time.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to remember that not everyone at the IRS is a tax expert \u2014 some work in non-tax-specific areas in occupations ranging from IT programmers, administrative professionals to human capital specialists. Where employees have been found to have made unintentional tax mistakes, they would still be eligible to receive performance awards they have earned,\u201d the agency said.\n\nThe IRS\u2019s inspector general reported in April that the agency paid out more than $1 million in bonuses earlier this decade to 1,146 employees who investigators said had \u201ctax compliance problems.\u201d Those employees were also awarded more than 10,000 hours of paid vacation, valued at $256,000.\n\nInspector General J. Russell George said the bonus payments are legal, but pointedly noted that the law calls for IRS employees found guilty of serious misconduct to be fired.\n\nIn his email to employees, Mr. Koskinen apologized for the bonuses\u2019 timing, saying he\u2019d wished they would have gone out by the end of this year. But he said bonuses they paid in April \u201ccomplicated the situation.\u201d He said the agreement reached with the National Treasury Employees Union, which represents many IRS workers, calls for the next round of bonuses to be paid at the end of 2015.\n\nNTEU didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment Wednesday on the bonuses.", "article_metadata": {"description": "IRS employees who made \"unintentional\" mistakes on their taxes are still eligible to get bonuses this fiscal year, the agency confirmed this week.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "IRS employees who made \u201cunintentional\u201d mistakes on their taxes are still eligible to get bonuses this fiscal year, the agency confirmed this week.", "title": "IRS paying millions in bonuses to employees who are tax scofflaws", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/nov/26/irs-awards-millions-in-bonuses-to-tax-delinquent-e/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/06/23/irs-investigationjpeg-0dd4f.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/06/23/irs-investigationjpeg-0dd4f.jpg", "description": "IRS employees who made \"unintentional\" mistakes on their taxes are still eligible to get bonuses this fiscal year, the agency confirmed this week.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "IRS paying millions in bonuses to employees who are tax scofflaws"}, "Author": "Stephen Dinan", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Business Finance, Labor, Internal Revenue Service, John Koskinen"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda2be\"", "article_summary": "IRS employees who made \u201cunintentional\u201d mistakes on their taxes are still eligible to get bonuses this fiscal year, the agency confirmed this week.\nInspector General J.
