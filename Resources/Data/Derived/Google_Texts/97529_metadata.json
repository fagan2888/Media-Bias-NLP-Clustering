Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, told a gathering of conservative lawmakers and policy wonks, and in 2016, conservatives must develop one that allows the U.S. military to engage the terrorist army \u201cno matter where they are.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis administration has been so intent on containing it, on degrading ISIS capabilities, but we can\u2019t just do that,\u201d Ernst said Wednesday at Heritage Action\u2019s Conservative Policy Summit in Washington, D.C. \u201cThat\u2019s not working. ISIS continues to spread.\u201d\n\nTo address the growing threat, Ernst said, she is working with fellow members of the Senate Armed Forces Committee to draft a new Authorization for Use of Military Force that would allow U.S. troops to engage the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, in Africa or Afghanistan or wherever the terrorists are discovered.\n\n\u201cWe have to defeat it,\u201d the Iowa Republican said, \u201cbut we know the U.S. can\u2019t do this on our own.\u201d\n\nThe strongest American ally Ernst pointed to in the fight against ISIS is the Kurdish Peshmerga. Ernst, who served in the region with the Iowa Army National Guard, said:\n\nThey are in Iraq and they are proven fighters. They also provide a safe haven in Kurdistan for 2 million refugees. If more countries would do that throughout the Middle East, we would see less of a refugee crisis coming westward.\n\nFor that reason, Ernst\u2014the first female combat veteran to serve in the U.S. Senate\u2014said she is working on a bill \u201cthat would directly arm the Kurdish Peshmerga.\u201d\n\nThe problem right now, she said, is that weapons are not making their way directly into the hands of Kurdish Peshmerga soldiers.\n\nIn addition to bolstering the fight against ISIS, Ernst said conservatives also must address the issue of \u201cdebt and waste\u201d in the Department of Defense.\n\n\u201cI am very, very passionate about our military and making sure that we are well funded \u2026 but we have to look inward too at the waste that we have throughout the department,\u201d Ernst said.\n\nTo demonstrate the scale of the waste, Ernst shared a personal story about her time serving in Kuwait. At one point, she said, the tents in which troops slept began to leak. To solve the problem, Ernst said, she and her colleagues went out in the local community and purchased blue tarps for $100 each.\n\nWhen her commander found out, \u201c[he] said you can\u2019t do that because that is covered by a contract,\u201d Ernst said.\n\n\u201cIn comes the contractor with all their hired people and they put the exact brand of blue tarps on our tents. The cost to the U.S. government was $1,000 per tarp.\u201d\n\nErnst said her story, which clearly rattled members in the audience, is only a small example of the \u201cmillions\u201d in waste that occurs each year. \u201cWe find these examples time and time again,\u201d the freshman senator said.\n\nAnother priority, Ernst said, should be ensuring the U.S. military isn\u2019t too \u201ctop heavy,\u201d and that lower-ranking service members are provided \u201cevery advantage possible.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the military, we have to remember we have to care for that man on our left and that man on our right,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are all part of a team.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Iowa Republican tells conservatives that Congress must allow the U.S. military to hunt down ISIS \"no matter where they are.\"", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The Iowa Republican tells conservatives that Congress must allow the U.S. military to hunt down ISIS \"no matter where they are.\"", "title": "Ernst Calls for Strategy to Fight ISIS No Matter Where They Are", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/zumaglobal605748_Ernst_HAFA.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-03T21:38:01+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1Pi6Ec7"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The Iowa Republican tells conservatives that Congress must allow the U.S. military to hunt down ISIS \"no matter where they are.\"", "title": "Ernst Calls for Strategy to Fight ISIS No Matter Where They Are", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/zumaglobal605748_Ernst_HAFA.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Security", "tag": "military,terrorism", "published_time": "2016-02-03T15:34:36+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-03T21:38:01+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "isis, joni ernst, military, terrorism,  Sen.
