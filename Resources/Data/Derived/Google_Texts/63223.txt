A Wichita police officer shot an aggressive dog Friday evening after the dog jumped a fence and attacked neighbors.

It happened around 5:15 p.m. in the 2000 block of South Bonn Street, near Pawnee and Meridian. A woman told police the dog, a pit bull-Labrador mix jumped a six-foot fence and was attacking her and her children.

When an officer arrived on scene, the dog began attacking the patrol car, and the officer was unable to get out. Sgt. Roger Runft said the officer used pepper spray to no avail.

When the dog turned its aggression toward another neighbor, the officer exited his vehicle and again used pepper spray, which had no effect. Sgt. Runft said the officer then shot the dog.

After being shot, the dog ran and jumped the fence back into its yard.

Animal control arrived on scene and took the dog. Sgt. Runft said he wasn't sure whether the dog was taken to a veterinarian or back to the shelter.

No one was hurt in the attack. Sgt. Runft said its too early in the investigation to know whether the dog will be euthanized.

Sgt. Runft said the dog's owner was on scene and was made aware of the situation.
