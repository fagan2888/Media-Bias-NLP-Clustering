The so-called “deflate-gate” scandal has seized far more than its fair share of media attention this week, as sports writers, commentators, politicians, scientists and jokesters of all walks make easy hay of the latest instance of alleged cheating leveled at the Super Bowl-bound New England Patriots.

I, however, suspect that a decidedly more prominent factor carried the Patriots to a 44-7 romp that day: They caught an inferior team on a bad day.
