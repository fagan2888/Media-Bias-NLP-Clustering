The IMF\u2019s World Economic Outlook, released Monday night, forecast global growth of 3.5 percent this year, down from 3.8 percent in October\u2019s report. The estimate for 2016 was lowered from 4 percent to 3.7 percent.\n\nThose revisions represent the biggest cuts to the IMF\u2019s forecast in three years, an indication of just how much economic conditions in Europe and elsewhere have deteriorated despite the consumer benefits of falling oil prices. Yet even as the outlook for many regions has worsened, the U.S. remains reasonably well insulated from those percolating economic troubles, the report suggests. Growth prospects for the U.S were actually raised slightly to 3.6 percent. At the same time, the IMF makes clear that the U.S. will eventually feel the effects if the global economy fails to turn around.\n\nRelated: How Obama\u2019s Tax Hikes Actually Hurt the Middle Class\n\n\u201cAt the country level, the cross currents make for a complicated picture,\u201d Olivier Blanchard, IMF Economic Counselor and Director of Research said in a release. \u201cIt means good news for oil importers, bad news for oil exporters. Good news for commodity importers, bad news for exporters. Continuing struggles for the countries which show scars of the crisis, and not so for others. Good news for countries more linked to the euro and the yen, bad news for those more linked to the dollar.\u201d\n\nWHY THIS MATTERS\n\n\n\nThe global fallout from the 2008 financial crisis isn\u2019t over yet, but the IMF report suggests the U.S. economy should be able to withstand continued weakness in Europe and other regions, helped by lower oil prices. A worldwide slowdown could still undercut some of the recent economic gains at home.\n\nIn the near term, at least, U.S. workers and consumers should be able to look forward to relatively steady growth, in large part because compared to most other countries, the U.S. economy is largely self-contained.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. is not that much of an export-oriented economy,\u201d said economist David Dollar, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a 20-year veteran of the World Bank. \u201cA special feature of the United States is that it seems to be the only big economy that can grow based on domestic demand.\u201d\n\nOthers agreed that, at least in the near term, falling exports will have a minimal impact on growth in the U.S.\n\nRelated: The Bond Market Is Warning of Huge Trouble Ahead\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty light drag,\u201d said Josh Bivens, director of research and policy at the Economic Policy Institute. \u201cWe are still a pretty closed economy as compared to others.\u201d\n\nTo be clear, by \u201cclosed,\u201d Bivens and others are talking about the relative percentage of the economy that is dependent on imports and exports.\n\n\u201cAs a policy matter, we\u2019re pretty open,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t stop imports. But we are a really, really big economy. We just end up doing lots of buying and selling among ourselves. Big economies tend to be slightly more closed. A big, rich economy like ours has less need for specialization.\u201d\n\nNone of this is to say that the global slowdown will have no effect on the U.S. The Brookings Institution\u2019s Dollar estimates that the effect, currently, is marginal. \u201cA soft world economy takes away a couple of tenths of a percentage point of growth; a robust world economy adds a couple of tenths of a percentage point.\u201d\n\nRelated: The Economic State of the Union in 7 Charts\n\nWhat could start causing some difficulty, though, is if international capital flows, already sending more cash to the U.S., continue to increase.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t view the U.S. as in need of a lot of capital,\u201d said Dollar. \u201cSoftness around the world means capital flow into the U.S. but that\u2019s not necessarily a good thing. The immediate effect is to strengthen the U.S. dollar, which has a muting effect on exports.\u201d\n\nWhile they may not account for a large amount of U.S. growth, a blow to exports not just related to a weaker global economy but to U.S. goods being priced out of many markets, could have a more negative impact over time.\n\n\u201cMost of the things that could hurt the U.S. would be related to a stronger dollar running through weaker exports,\u201d said Bivens. \u201cIt could be a drag on growth.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Economists at the International Monetary Fund just took a hacksaw to their global grow", "title": "As Global Economic Outlook Worsens, U.S. Bucks the Trend \u2026 for Now", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/01/21/Global-Economic-Outlook-Worsens-US-Bucks-Trend-Now", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02282013_Split_Globe_Cash_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/01/21/Global-Economic-Outlook-Worsens-US-Bucks-Trend-Now", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02282013_Split_Globe_Cash_article.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Economists at the International Monetary Fund just took a hacksaw to their global grow", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "The IMF\u2019s World Economic Outlook, released Monday night, forecast global growth of 3.5 percent this year, down from 3.8 percent in October\u2019s report.\nAt the same time, the IMF makes clear that the U.S. will eventually feel the effects if the global economy fails to turn around.\nEconomists at the International Monetary Fund just took a hacksaw to their global growth forecasts, slicing 0.3 percentage points off their previous projection for the world economy in 2015.\nYet even as the outlook for many regions has worsened, the U.S. remains reasonably well insulated from those percolating economic troubles, the report suggests.\n\u201cIt means good news for oil importers, bad news for oil exporters."}
