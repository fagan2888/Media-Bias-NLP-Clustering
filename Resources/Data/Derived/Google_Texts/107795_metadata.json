The worker with the best predictions usually receives something of value\u2014the \"pot,\" if money is involved. That type of pool arrangement appears to violate the Texas penal code on gambling, according to Campiti.\n\nIt's also likely to violate the gambling laws of nearly every other state, though some have thought about legalizing March Madness pools.

March Madness pools have become part of office culture, like picking the Oscar winners every year\u2014which in theory falls under the same laws as March Madness pools.\n\nOne law professor wrote that it's best to avoid serving as the pool administrator, the person collecting and handing out prize money.\n\nMeanwhile, Thompson & Knight's Campiti said that as long as employees don't have to pay an entry fee to participate, the contests shouldn't involve illegal \"betting,\" at least under Texas law and that \"a safer course is not to require anything of value to participate, even though distributing a prize to the winners would be OK.\"\n\nIn other words, play at your own risk. But it's unlikely the police will be raiding the office.\n\nBetter yet, focus on trying to win the $1 billion pot from business guru Warren Buffett for the perfect bracket That is billion with a \"b\"!\n\nThis article originally appeared in CBNC.\n\nRead more from CNBC:\n\nHate the long winter?
