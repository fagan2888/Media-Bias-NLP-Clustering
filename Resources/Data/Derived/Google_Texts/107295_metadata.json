Another 16 percent said they would leave it, and 26 percent said they did not know what they would do with their registration. The online poll of 468 Republican Trump supporters has a credibility interval of 5.3 percentage points.\n\n(Click here for the poll results: http://tmsnrt.rs/25PRLZe\n\nTrump has topped the national polls throughout most of the race for the Republican nomination, and has won more delegates than any other Republican so far. A Reuters/Ipsos online poll from April 4-8 showed that 42 percent of Republicans support Trump, compared with 32 percent for U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and 20 percent for Ohio Governor John Kasich. [L2N17B1J0]\n\nCruz and Kasich have both said their paths to victory rely on winning at least enough votes to block an outright win for Trump and force a decision at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland.\n\n'I'LL BE FED UP'\n\nBut Trump, whose supporters have remained loyal even as he rankled women, Hispanics, Muslims, veterans and others with his fiery rhetoric on the campaign trail, predicted last month there would be riots outside the convention if he was blocked.\n\n\"If they broker him out, I\u2019ll be fed up with the Republicans,\u201d said Chuck Thompson, 66, a Trump supporter from Concord, North Carolina, who took the poll.\n\nThompson, a lifelong Republican, said he admires Trump\u2019s independence from big campaign donors and takes that as a sign that the front-runner will be able to think for himself if he were to become president.\n\nIf Trump loses the nomination, Thompson said he would quit the party. \u201cThe people want Donald Trump. If they (Republicans) can\u2019t deal with that, I don\u2019t need them,\u201d he said.\n\nGreen said the departure of even a small number of Republicans would make it tough for the party to prevent the Democrats from winning the White House, especially if the election is again decided by razor-thin margins in a handful of battleground states.\n\nIn 2012, President Barack Obama won Florida by less than 1 percentage point and Ohio and Virginia by less than 4 percentage points. \u201cThe Republicans don\u2019t really have any margin of error,\u201d Green said.\n\nTrump and Cruz both trail Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton among likely general election voters in a hypothetical general election matchup, but not by much, according to the latest Reuters/Ipsos polls.\n\nGenerally, a convention battle is a bad sign for the health of a political party, said Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and author of the book, \u201cPrimary Politics: How Presidential Candidates Have Shaped the Modern Nominating System.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen a party gets to a point when it has a contested convention, it almost always hurts them,\u201d Kamarck said. \u201cIt\u2019s a confirmation of some really deep fissures within the party that were unable to be dealt with during the primary season.\u201d\n\nTrump supporter Elizabeth Oerther, 40, of Louisville, Kentucky, said she would switch parties and vote for the Democratic nominee if the Republicans denied Trump the nomination.\n\n\"If you don\u2019t give it to him, I\u2019m going to vote against them,\" said Oerther, who took the poll. \u201cThey want to take away the choice of the people. That\u2019s wrong.\u201d\n\n(Reporting by Chris Kahn; Editing by Bill Trott)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "(Reuters) - A third of Republican voters who support Donald Trump could turn their bac", "title": "Exclusive: Blocking Trump could hurt Republicans in election - Reuters/Ipsos poll", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/09/Exclusive-Blocking-Trump-could-hurt-Republicans-election-ReutersIpsos-poll", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-election-trump_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/09/Exclusive-Blocking-Trump-could-hurt-Republicans-election-ReutersIpsos-poll", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-election-trump_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "(Reuters) - A third of Republican voters who support Donald Trump could turn their bac", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe11b8\"", "article_summary": "A Reuters/Ipsos online poll from April 4-8 showed that 42 percent of Republicans support Trump, compared with 32 percent for U.S.\nThe online poll of 468 Republican Trump supporters has a credibility interval of 5.3 percentage points.\n\"If it\u2019s a close election, this is devastating news\" for the Republicans, said Donald Green, an expert on election turnout at Columbia University.\nMeanwhile, 58 percent said they would remain with the Republican Party.\n(Reuters) - A third of Republican voters who support Donald Trump could turn their backs on their party in November's presidential election if he is denied the nomination in a contested convention, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll."}
