A senior aide to U.S. Rep. Steve Stivers has resigned after Politico.com reported that a porn actress he dated had posted a photo of his penis on the congressman’s Twitter account.

Adam Kuhn, who has been chief of staff to the Republican congressman from the Columbus, stepped down today, according to Courtney Whetstone, a Stivers’ spokeswoman. Stivers’ congressional district includes Clinton, Madison, Fayette, and several other counties.

“The office is not commenting on his personal life,” she said.

Kuhn, who has been chief of staff to Stivers since last year, issued a statement to Politico – a web site and newspaper that covers Congress and Capitol Hill – saying that he “was the victim of an attack on Twitter from a woman I had a relationship with in my personal life.”

“I realize and apologize (that) I had used poor judgment in my personal life regarding this relationship,” Kuhn said in the statement. “The woman who posted this has reached out to me to apologize.”

Kuhn, who is single, dated Jennifer Roubenes Allbaugh, who calls herself Ruby according to her Facebook page. Politico reported she posted the photo after Kuhn broke up with her.
