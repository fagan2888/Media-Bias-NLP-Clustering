In their lawsuit, Democrats argued that the House\u2019s unilateral decision to adjourn Tuesday afternoon violated a part of the Florida Constitution that reads: \u201cNeither house shall adjourn for more than seventy-two consecutive hours except pursuant to concurrent resolution.\u201d\n\nBut in a concurring opinion joined by four other members of the court, Justice Barbara Pariente rejected House Republicans\u2019 argument that the 72-hour provision does not apply to adjourning \u201csine die\u201d \u2014 from the Latin phrase for \u201cwithout day\u201d \u2014 which marks the end of a legislative session.\n\n\u201cThat constitutional provision clearly does not permit one house to adjourn in any fashion for more than seventy-two consecutive hours without the consent of the other house,\u201d Pariente wrote.\n\nThe problem, Pariente said, was that with the session required to end on Friday, just one day after Senate Democrats filed the challenge, \u201cthere is simply no way to mandate that the entire Florida House of Representatives return to Tallahassee to continue conducting its legislative responsibilities.\u201d\n\nJoining in the opinion were the other four members of the court\u2019s more-liberal majority: Chief Justice Jorge Labarga and justices R. Fred Lewis, James E.C. Perry and Peggy Quince.\n\nJustice Charles Canady filed a brief opinion saying Senate Democrats \u201chave failed to establish a clear legal right to compel the presence of the House of Representatives until midnight on May 1, 2015.\u201d Justice Ricky Polston, who often joins Canady in the minority, also signed onto that opinion.\n\nToo late to countermand the House\u2019s illegal action, but not too late to make a point.\n\n\n\nSenate Democrats used Pariente\u2019s opinion to declare victory.\n\n\u201cWe fought to establish a lasting precedent today that both chambers are equal under the law,\u201d Sen. Darren Soto, D-Orlando, said in a statement issued after the ruling. \u201cI am proud that the Supreme Court agreed with us, and that this is now the law of the land for future Florida legislatures.\u201d\n\nSenate President Andy Gardiner, an Orlando Republican who had also questioned the constitutionality of the House\u2019s decision, said the decision \u201cprovides important guidance to future presiding officers.\u201d\n\nHouse Minority Leader Mark Pafford, D-West Palm Beach, blasted the GOP leadership of his chamber.\n\n\u201cHouse Republican leadership unconstitutionally stole three days of productive work from the people of Florida,\u201d he said.\n\nHouse Speaker Steve Crisafulli, R-Merritt Island, used the court ruling to get in a shot at the Senate. House leaders have pointed out that both chambers have often adjourned for more than 72 hours without a formal agreement.\n\n\u201cIn fact, according to the new interpretation of the Florida Supreme Court, the Senate violated their constitutional duty throughout this session when they adjourned for more than 72 hours without the House\u2019s consent in the form of a concurrent resolution,\u201d Crisafulli said. \u201cI did not take the Florida Senate to court at the time because I did not believe that they were violating their constitutional duty, but rather conducting themselves according to the sovereignty to which they are entitled.\u201d\n\nCrisafulli\u2019s decision to end the session Tuesday came amid a bitterly divisive battle between House and Senate leaders over health-care funding. The Senate wants to use $2.8 billion in Medicaid expansion money to help low-income Floridians purchase private health insurance, in the hopes that the move will encourage federal officials to extend an additional $2.2 billion pool of money for hospitals and other medical care providers. House leaders have consistently refused to go along with the Medicaid-funded expansion.\n\nDespite Friday\u2019s ruling by the Supreme Court, lawmakers will have to return to Tallahassee to wrap up work on a budget. No date has been set for that special session.\n\n\u201cWith the lawsuits over and a little time to reflect, I trust that we can return with a new level of civility on both sides,\u201d Crisafulli said. \u201cWe will make up for these three days, and then some.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, State Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fort Walton Beach, apologized Friday for a Twitter post that drew criticism about possible racial overtones. The controversy started Thursday when Gaetz tweeted about Senate Democrats\u2019 lawsuit.\n\n\u201cThis lawsuit reads like it was researched and drafted by Sen Joyner \u2026 and spell checked by Sen Bullard,\u201d Gaetz wrote, referring to Senate Minority Leader Arthenia Joyner, D-Tampa, and Sen. Dwight Bullard, D-Miami. Joyner and Bullard are African-Americans, and the tweet caused an uproar that even led House Speaker Steve Crisafulli, R-Merritt Island, to say he didn\u2019t condone Gaetz\u2019s post. \u201cHe is an agitator, yes, but not a racist,\u201d Crisafulli tweeted. \u201cPlease accept my apology to those offended.\u201d\n\nBut Joyner issued a lengthy statement Friday morning that described Gaetz\u2019s tweet as racist. At the time, Gaetz had yet to apologize. \u201cThere were some additional tweets, one attacking liberals and Obamacare, but the silence addressing his disparaging remarks has been deafening,\u201d Joyner said. \u201cIn fact, I believe they underscored what myself and others have long suspected, namely that this fierce battle launched by the House Republicans against the Senate\u2019s good healthcare expansion bill had nothing to do with taking federal money.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd so while the speaker may try his best to walk back the motive of his member, he cannot walk back the 140 characters of Rep. Gaetz\u2019s racist barb,\u201d Joyner said in the statement. \u201cHis words are the kind I have fought against my entire life, the relic of days through which I lived and hope never to live through again.\u201d In the apology Friday, Gaetz indicated his tweet was related to opposition to a health-coverage expansion under the Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare.\n\n\u201cMy criticisms of ObamaCare Expansion and it\u2019s [sic.] supporters are based solely on the facts,\u201d Gaetz tweeted Friday. \u201cDeeply sorry if anyone read more into it than that.\u201d\n\nBeyond the clashes, there was no hanky drop to mark \u201csine die\u201d on Friday.\n\nThe House and Senate sergeants at arms didn\u2019t carry out the tradition of meeting in the fourth-floor rotunda, between the two chambers, to hold a brief ceremonial handkerchief drop to signal the end of the annual legislative session. Also absent were the cheering lawmakers, staff members and lobbyists \u2014 and the red plastic cups of adult beverages that seem to find their way into the rotunda.\n\nThe lights of the Senate chamber were quickly turned off at 5:08 p.m. Friday, as there was no lawmaking on either end of the Capitol on the final scheduled day of the 60-day session.\n\n\u201cMy colleagues and I look forward to returning to Tallahassee in short order to complete the work we were elected to do,\u201d Senate President Andy Gardiner, R-Orlando, said in a release just before 5 p.m.\n\nGardiner\u2019s statement came shortly after a majority of the Florida Supreme Court said an abrupt adjournment Tuesday by the House was unconstitutional, but that there wouldn\u2019t be an accompanying order for lawmakers to return to Tallahassee, as Senate Democrats had hoped.\n\nThe House adjournment came amid a bitter impasse with the Senate about budget and health-care issues. Lawmakers will have to return to the Capitol in May or June for a special session to negotiate and pass a budget.\n\nIn all, the most-untypical regular session included the House and Senate passing 232 bills from among a total of 1,752 that were filed. The number of bills approved by both chambers was the lowest in the past 15 years.\n\nThroughout the Capitol complex, few doors were open Friday. Students on end-of-year school outings to the Capitol replaced the well-dressed lobbyists who typically would have congregated outside the House and Senate chambers in the final hours of the session.\n\nEarlier in the day, Senate pages, with little work to perform for lawmakers, took the chamber floor to briefly hold their own mock session.\n\nAnd with few customers, the 10th floor snack bar reverted to its non-session 1 p.m. Friday closing time.\n\n\u2013News Service of Florida and FlaglerLive", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Florida Supreme Court ruling concluded it was too late to reconvene the session, essentially ending it, and the lawsuit that prompted the ruling.
