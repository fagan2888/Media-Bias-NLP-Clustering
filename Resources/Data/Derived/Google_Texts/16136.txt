NOTABLE

WRESTLER OF THE WEEK: Tepra Wright, Wisconsin Lutheran. Wright (13-0), ranked No. 2 in Division 2 at 132 pounds, is poised to take over the No. 1 ranking at 126 after his performance at the Badger State Invitational last weekend in Madison. Wright, the returning 126-pound D2 state champion, defeated then-No. 1 Sparta senior John Roddick (14-2) by a 10-2 major decision to win the 126 title at the 25-team event.

TEAM OF THE WEEK:Whitnall/Greendale. No team had a bigger week than the new co-op as it knocked off Pewaukee, 31-23, to take control of the Woodland Conference dual-meet race. Pewaukee is the defending league champion. Whitnall/Greendale followed that with a second-place finish at the Ed Stech Invite at West Allis Central. It was Whitnall's highest finish at the tournament in 21 years.

SMITHS BATTLE: Two of the top wrestlers in the area — Mukwonago junior Nathan Smith (16-1) and Port Washington senior Zach Smith (10-1) — collided in the 126 final at the Marty Loy Invitational in Fond du Lac. No. 3-ranked Nathan Smith held on for an 8-6 victory over No. 1 Zach Smith. In the third-place match, No. 7 Oak Creek junior Andrew McIntosh (13-2) defeated No. 4 Sauk Prairie sophomore Drew Fjoser (15-2) by a 6-2 decision.

BIRD FALLS: No. 1 Burlington junior Josh Bird (10-1) — a two-time state finalist and state champion two years ago — lost his first match of the season at the Marty Loy Invite. Bird lost, 8-6, in the 132 final. Acosta, ranked No. 4 at 132, improved to 18-0.
