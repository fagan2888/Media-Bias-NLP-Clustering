The fee is being phased in over three years, beginning in 2014.\n\nFor people who go uninsured in 2016, the fee will be the greater of two amounts, the website states:\n\nFlat fee of $695 per adult and $347.50 per child (up from $325 per adult and $162.50 per child for people who went uninsured this year). The maximum size of this penalty is $2,085.\n\n2.5 percent of household income (up from 2 percent for people who went uninsured this year). The maximum size of this penalty is an amount equivalent to the yearly premium for the national average price of a Bronze plan, the cheapest/lowest plan available through the federal health insurance exchange.\n\nPeople who are eligible for financial assistance face a smaller average household fee of $738 for going uninsured next year, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation analysis. People who are ineligible for subsidies to help pay the cost of insurance \u2014 and who tend to have higher incomes \u2014 face a larger average household fee of $1,450.\n\nBecause ACA fees are paid upon the filing of federal tax returns, people who go uninsured in 2016 might not learn exactly how much their 2016 fee will amount to until April 2017.\n\nThe open enrollment period for 2016 insurance plans is underway and will end Jan. 31. However, you must purchase a plan by Dec. 15 to guarantee coverage by Jan. 1.\n\nIf you have not yet enrolled in a plan for the new year and wish to avoid the fee, check out \u201cObamacare Open Enrollment Is Coming: 5 Things You Need to Know.\u201d\n\nHave you obtained health insurance for 2016 yet, or do you plan not to purchase it?
