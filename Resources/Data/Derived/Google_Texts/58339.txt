Rachael Ray, the daytime cook known best for drumming up homestyle meals in just a few minutes, is now making waves in the political world for her emotional thank-you to Vice President Joseph R. Biden for helping to bring to fruition the Obamacare that treated her brother.

She nearly came to tears during her most recent episode, which coincided with the last day of Obamacare enrollment, Breitbart.com reported.

Ms. Ray — with a huge video screen of Mr. Biden nearby — told how her brother, whose condition she doesn’t specify, and others she knows were able to obtain insurance and get their necessary medical treatment, even though their conditions were pre-existing. And it’s all due to Obamacare, she said, nearly choking up as she thanked Mr. Biden, Breitbart reported.

Ms. Ray also told how important it was for youth to obtain Obamacare, because the time will come when they’ll be happy to have medical coverage.

Mr. Biden, for his part, repeated to television watchers that if they don’t have Obamacare, they need to “get in the queue, get in the queue.”
