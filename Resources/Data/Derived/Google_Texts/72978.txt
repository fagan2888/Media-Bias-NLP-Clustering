Last night I did a not-very-serious post about this cartoon by my favorite cartoonist, Michael Ramirez. I liked the cartoon, I said, and the three turkeys pictured bore an obvious resemblance, but I felt like I was missing something:

Lots of readers weighed in with their interpretations. But now we have the definitive word from Michael Ramirez himself, who took note of my puzzlement and wrote to explain:

Hey John, Sorry for the confusion. It was the rare cartoon with no deep penetrating message or profound thought but merely a reflection of my view of the President’s recent performance on the world stage and the disastrous results of his destructive and dangerous policies. Looking at the President’s failed policies and feckless performance, President Obama is merely a member of the flock, leading from behind a tree, trying to survive. I hope this explains the cartoon. I thought of putting the caption, “Turkeys” under the ‘toon but a friend and a colleague told me it was so obvious that it was unnecessary. They’re fired… Just kidding. I’m a huge fan of PL. Keep up the great (and necessary) work I hope you have a wonderful Thanksgiving. Best wishes,

-m p.s. Tell them to buy my new book, Give Me Liberty or Give Me Obamacare. It is filled with cartoons that are far less ambiguous and makes a great gift for conservatives and a much needed guide for progressives.

Thanks and Happy Thanksgiving to you, Michael, and to our readers: buy this book!
