Workers install windows at Mercy Hospital Joplin (via Mercy Hospital)

More than 3 years after a tornado destroyed much of Joplin, Missouri, officials have set an opening date for a new hospital to replace the one destroyed by the storm.

The Mercy Hospital Joplin will open on March 22, the healthcare provider said on Friday, ending a $465 million project to build the new facility. McCarthy Building Companies, architectural firms HKS and Archimages, and engineers MEP Engineer Heideman & Associates all played a role.

“Speed of delivery was of the utmost importance,” John Farnen, executive director of strategic projects for Mercy, said in a statement. “It took a truly collaborative effort to design and construct this hospital so quickly.”

The 890,000-square-foot facility replaces the St. John’s Mercy Regional Medical Center, which was devastated by the 2011 tornado. The new Mercy hospital was built to withstand the most powerful storms, featuring a 450-foot underground tunnel linked to a 30,000-square-foot central utility plant housing mechanical, electrical and plumbing systems and windows that can withstand 250-mile-per-hour winds.

The generator system can also power the hospital for 96 hours on its own.

“This replacement hospital is opening just 46 months after the tornado hit Joplin, which is approximately half the time you would normally anticipate to plan, design and construct a similarly sized hospital,” said Ryan Felton, McCarthy project director, the the statement.

“This project was meaningful on many levels. It wasn’t only about a facility, it was about people – a community suffering from loss and devastation,” said said Norman Morgan, HKS principal-in-charge. “Our job was to give them hope – give them back their hospital. This rebuilding effort became part of the healing process for the community.”
