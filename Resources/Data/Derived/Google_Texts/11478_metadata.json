Diane Black (R., Tenn.) put it after the oral arguments , \u201cOnly Obamacare could create a system that carries 18 times the fine for providing insurance coverage to employees than for not providing any coverage at all.\u201d\n\nIf your employer offers you insurance that doesn\u2019t provide free ella, or anything else on the list of \u201cpreventive services\u201d\u2014as defined by Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius and ultimately by Obama\u2014then it\u2019s subject to a fine of $36,500 a year. But if your employer doesn\u2019t offer you insurance at all, it\u2019s subject to a fine of $2,000 a year. Actually, for now your employer\u2019s choice is between a fine of $36,500 or $0, as Obama has extralegally decreed that fines for not providing insurance (but not fines for providing insurance that doesn\u2019t cover all \u201cpreventive services\u201d) will be waived until after we get to the other side of the midterm elections.\n\nWould President Obama prefer that you have health insurance of which he doesn\u2019t approve, or no health insurance at all? Well, based on the penalties in play under his signature legislation, it would appear that he prefers for you to have no insurance at all than to have the \u201cwrong\u201d insurance (as defined, of course, by his administration).\n\nWould President Obama prefer that you have health insurance of which he doesn\u2019t approve, or no health insurance at all?
