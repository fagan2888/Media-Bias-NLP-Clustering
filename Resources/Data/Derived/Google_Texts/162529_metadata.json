On Monday afternoon Obama will meet with President Xi Jinping of China, Russia\u2019s neighbor and sometime rival.\n\nPutin has forced the United States and Europe to refocus on the origins of the modern transatlantic alliance -- the 1949 NATO defense partnership designed to prevent a Russian invasion of Western Europe.\n\n\u201cWe live in a different world than we did less than a month ago,\u201d NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen told an audience in Washington last week. Russia's aggression is \u201ca wake-up call for the Euro-Atlantic community, for NATO, and for all those committed to a Europe whole, free, and at peace.\u201d\n\nRussian brute force is a jarring diversion from Obama\u2019s second-term agenda of combatting climate change, increasing the minimum wage, and his \u201chealth care bracketology\u201d\u2014 a headline used on the White House website to spur people to sign up for coverage under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nSo far Obama\u2019s response to the Ukraine crisis has been cautious. After he announced another set of targeted asset freezes on individuals close to Putin, a senior Obama administration official said the United States will \u201ccalibrate our pressure on the Russians.\u201d\n\nSo far, the carefully calibrated steps by Obama and European governments haven\u2019t matched the drama of Putin\u2019s audacious military moves.\n\nJosef Joffe, the publisher and editor of the German weekly Die Zeit, said Putin \u201cknows an opportunity when he sees one. And it was hard to resist this opportunity\u201d in seizing Crimea since it involved \u201cminimal force, maximum gain and, even better, the man has gained what we call \u2018street cred.\u2019\u201d\n\nJoffe explained, \u201cOnce you\u2019ve established the reputation for the willingness and the ability to use force and to be ruthless about it, you don\u2019t have to use force and conquer next time \u2013 you\u2019ve established the reputation as a nasty bastard.\u201d\n\nThe crisis comes as Europe is still stuck with feeble or no economic growth and with painfully high unemployment rates -- 12 percent throughout the euro area \u2013 and youth unemployment rates of as high as 55 percent in Spain.\n\nAn escalation of economic sanctions against Russia \u201cis where the rubber is going to meet the road for Europe because it will produce immediate economic pain in a fragile situation. (Europeans) will try to do everything not to go down that path,\u201d said Heather Conley, the director of the Europe Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank.\n\nAnd there\u2019s some distrust between Obama and the Europeans as they try to join forces against Putin.\n\nPrevious American presidents had occasional quarrels with European leaders, \u201cbut never were we faced with a kind of indifference that Obama seems to exude,\u201d Joffe said. \u201cThat indifference, of course, became more concrete in these shibboleths like \u2018rebalancing\u2019 and \u2018pivot\u2019 and \u2018we have to play the next power game in Asia.\u2019\u201d\n\nConley said an immediate agenda item for Obama and his European counterparts this week is \u201cWhat does NATO need to do to provide stability and security to our eastern NATO members who are right now feeling extremely anxious?\u201d She said this will mean moving some military assets to the NATO member nations close to the Ukraine action: Poland, Romania, and the Baltic states.\n\nObama said Thursday that \u201cAmerica\u2019s support for our NATO allies is unwavering. We\u2019re bound together by our profound Article 5 commitment (under the 1949 NATO treaty) to defend one another.\u201d\n\nBut Ukraine isn\u2019t a NATO member \u2013 and therefore not sheltered by the Article 5 defense shield. And it\u2019s not clear how far Obama and European leaders are willing to go to build Ukraine\u2019s forces so they can defend their country and deter a Russian attack.\n\n\u201cWe are going to have to think very hard in Europe and in the United States about how we are going to respond to the Ukrainian government\u2019s legitimate requests to have the wherewithal to defend itself,\u201d said Francois Heisbourg, a former French Foreign Ministry official who is now chairman of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a think tank in London and Washington.\n\nIn a conference call with reporters Thursday, an Obama administration official sounded quite non-committal on arming the Ukrainians.\n\n\u201cWe don't want to take steps to add to a momentum of further militarizing the situation,\u201d the official said. The official would say only that \u201cwe will consider on an ongoing basis these requests from the Ukrainian military.\u201d But equipping the Ukrainians to engage in a conflict with Russia is \u201cjust simply not the preferred outcome here.\u201d\n\nIn the longer term, the geostrategic balance between Europe and Russia hinges on energy. The European Union depends on Russia for about 30 percent of its natural gas.\n\nHeisbourg said, \u201cYou have on the table in the United States the issue of: Are you going to export hydrocarbons or not? And the Europeans have on their table: are we going to stop our silliness about shutting down existing sources of production of energy \u2013 nuclear energy in Germany -- and preventing ourselves from exploring new sources of energy like unconventional (shale) gas. This, I understand, will be a significant element of the EU-US summit\u201d in Brussels this week which will follow The Hague meetings.\n\n\u201cThis is truly of the essence if, over the next two years, we want to un-build the strategic dependency of Europe on Russian gas,\u201d Heisbourg said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Putin has forced the United States and Europe to refocus on the origins of the modern transatlantic alliance -- the 1949 NATO defense partnership designed to prevent a Russian invasion of Western Europe.", "og": {"url": "http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/ukraine-crisis/obama-flies-europe-shaken-putins-bold-strategy-n59851", "type": "article", "image": "http://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2014_12/273831/140323-barack-obama-jms-1610_5e5e8cb9003129370ee55a5cafe343d0.nbcnews-fp-1200-800.jpg", "site_name": "NBC News", "description": "Putin has forced the United States and Europe to refocus on the origins of the modern transatlantic alliance -- the 1949 NATO defense partnership designed to prevent a Russian invasion of Western Europe."}, "twitter": {"domain": "NBCNews.com", "description": "Putin has forced the United States and Europe to refocus on the origins of the modern transatlantic alliance -- the 1949 NATO defense partnership designed to prevent a Russian invasion of Western Europe.", "creator": "NBCNews", "image": {"src": "http://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2014_12/273831/140323-barack-obama-jms-1610_5e5e8cb9003129370ee55a5cafe343d0.nbcnews-fp-1200-800.jpg"}, "title": "Obama Flies to a Europe Shaken by Putin's Bold Strategy - NBC News", "site": "NBCNews", "card": "summary"}, "blitz": "mu-e1e842c9-946002e6-ea8f0454-41b29546", "DC.date.issued": "2014-03-23", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=319740707, app-argument=http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/ukraine-crisis/obama-flies-europe-shaken-putins-bold-strategy-n59851", "fb": {"app_id": 10150138890205613}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/NBCNews"}, "google-site-verification": "K8bowvEbzWfPQ76x6f9SCxMVwicVXrhiClRg80ak8ZA", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Politics,Politics News"}, "article_summary": "President Barack Obama flies Sunday to a Europe shaken by Vladimir Putin\u2019s seizure of Crimea and his threats against eastern parts of Ukraine.\nPutin has forced the United States and Europe to refocus on the origins of the modern transatlantic alliance -- the 1949 NATO defense partnership designed to prevent a Russian invasion of Western Europe.\nHeisbourg said, \u201cYou have on the table in the United States the issue of: Are you going to export hydrocarbons or not?\nIn a conference call with reporters Thursday, an Obama administration official sounded quite non-committal on arming the Ukrainians.\nOn Monday afternoon Obama will meet with President Xi Jinping of China, Russia\u2019s neighbor and sometime rival."}
