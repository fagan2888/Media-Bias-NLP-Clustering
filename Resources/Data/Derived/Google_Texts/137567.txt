Re: “Give kids a reason to do well on standardized tests,” April 19 letter to the editor; and “Many students are opting out of testing by not trying,” April 11 letter to the editor.

Letter-writers D.R. Miklich and Mark Newton contend that students have “no reason” to put themselves out on standardized exams and suggest that there should be some motivation (such as driver’s licenses) for the students to do well.

Are kids so spoiled these days that the mere idea of doing their best means nothing to them? I recall always wanting to do do my best on any exam, regardless of the impact it had on my grades.
