The Community Living Assistance Services and Supports Act (CLASS Act) was enacted as part of the Affordable Care Act. CLASS would have created a voluntary and public LTCi option for employees, but it was repealed in 2013 after the Obama administration declared it was unworkable.\n\nGreene pointed out a number of advantages that NAHU\u2019s proposal would provide to Americans who are in the workforce. Offering LTCi as a group benefit to employees would enable people to buy coverage at a better rate than they might be able to obtain it on their own, and the coverage would be portable, meaning that workers could keep the coverage even if they change jobs, provided that they continue to pay the premiums. \u201cWe want to get people into long-term care coverage before they leave the workplace,\u201d Greene said.\n\nBy allowing workers to purchase LTCi with their 401(k) or 403(b) funds, employees would be protecting and preserving their retirement nest egg with pretax dollars, he added.\n\nIn addition, making changes to Medicaid requirements would help to preserve public funds, Greene said. \u201cMuch as you saw the Social Security disability system going broke after the last recession, now with long-term care, it\u2019s going to be d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu all over again with Medicaid,\u201d he said.\n\nGreene said that he hopes to schedule a meeting with the Senate Special Committee on Aging to discuss the proposal. He said that NAHU may wait until the new Congress is seated before moving further on the plan.\n\nThe LTCi scene has experienced some upheaval in recent years, with many carriers abandoning the market and consumers who bought policies years ago finding themselves facing double-digit premium increases today.\n\n\u201cBy expanding the LTCi market, you would get more people enrolled, the price would settle down and carriers would come back to the market,\u201d Greene predicted.\n\n\u201cWe either do something to save this industry or we\u2019re all going to be paying a lot more in taxes to fund care.\u201d\n\nExpanding the market for LTCi is another way that NAHU members can diversify their practices, Greene noted. The ACA has slammed health insurance agents in the wallet as commissions on individual health policies have been slashed.\n\n\u201cThe days of selling health insurance across the kitchen table are gone,\u201d Greene said. \u201c(NAHU) has always encouraged our members to diversify. Our members have been branching out into small group health, dental and vision, and Medicare Advantage. This is one more way they can provide a service to the public.\u201d\n\nSusan Rupe is managing editor for InsuranceNewsNet.
