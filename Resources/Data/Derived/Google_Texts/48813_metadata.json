They were accused of doing more than $5,000 worth of damage to a property they once owned in Santa Barbara.\n\nBut they announced they were seeking asylum in Canada because they feared \"Hollywood star whackers\" were after them.\n\nThey described the purported murderers as accountants, lawyers and \"embezzlers\" who they claimed were responsible for the death of actor Heath Ledger, whom Randy Quaid appeared with in \"Brokeback Mountain.\" Ledger died in New York in 2008 from an accidental overdose of prescription drugs, according to authorities.\n\nFailed bid to stay in Canada\n\nRandy Quaid's efforts to remain in Canada for the long term didn't go smoothly, however.\n\nThe couple were granted permission to stay in 2011, and Evi Quaid was granted Canadian citizenship because her father was born in Canada. But Randy Quaid's request for permanent residency was denied in 2013.\n\nHe was expected to be deported to the United States on October 14, according to CTV, a CNN partner.\n\nRather than wait for authorities to send him back, Quaid and his wife appear to have taken matters into their own hands by attempting to cross into Vermont.\n\n$500,000 bail each\n\nBut they were identified as fugitives by U.S. Customs officials at the Highgate Port Of Entry, Vermont State Police said in a statement.\n\nThey are now being held at separate correctional facilities after a judge set bail at $500,000 for each of them, the statement said.\n\nAuthorities in Vermont have determined that the couple meet the requirements to be extradited to California on the warrants issued for them in Santa Barbara.\n\nRandy Quaid's other well known films include the \"National Lampoon\" movies and \"Independence Day.\" He was nominated for an Academy Award for his supporting role in 1973's \"The Last Detail.\" His younger brother is actor Dennis Quaid.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Five years after fleeing to Canada, actor Randy Quaid is back in the United States and in custody.", "language": "english", "author": "CNN", "og": {"url": "http://www.kake.com/entertainment/headlines/Randy-Quaid-arrested-in-Vermont-after-trying-to-cross-border-from-Canada-331923841.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/559*315/randy+quaid.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Five years after fleeing to Canada, actor Randy Quaid is back in the United States and in custody.", "title": "Randy Quaid arrested in Vermont after trying to cross border from Canada"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "Five years after fleeing to Canada, actor Randy Quaid is back in the United States and in custody.", "title": "Randy Quaid arrested in Vermont after trying to cross border from Canada", "url": "http://www.kake.com/entertainment/headlines/Randy-Quaid-arrested-in-Vermont-after-trying-to-cross-border-from-Canada-331923841.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/randy+quaid.jpg", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "keywords": "Randy Quaid arrested in Vermont after trying to cross border from Canada", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Randy Quaid arrested in Vermont, after trying to cross border"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd3cb\"", "article_summary": "Five years after fleeing to Canada, actor Randy Quaid is back in the United States and in custody.\nHe was expected to be deported to the United States on October 14, according to CTV, a CNN partner.\nRandy Quaid's other well known films include the \"National Lampoon\" movies and \"Independence Day.\"\nBut Randy Quaid's request for permanent residency was denied in 2013.\nThey described the purported murderers as accountants, lawyers and \"embezzlers\" who they claimed were responsible for the death of actor Heath Ledger, whom Randy Quaid appeared with in \"Brokeback Mountain.\""}
