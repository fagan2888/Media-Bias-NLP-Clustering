Fox Business\u2019 Neil Cavuto, however, saw the move as brilliant and encouraged his partymates to expand their comfort zone into the world of comedy. \u201cMaybe Republicans dismissing these type of venues is very dangerous,\u201d he said. \u201cI say, Republicans, ignore these venues at your own peril. Laugh all you want about Michelle Obama hawking fitness with Jimmy Fallon. Or her husband yucking it up with that guy before Fallon. A lot of people who don\u2019t watch news shows watch these shows. So why are you dismissing these shows?\u201d\n\nFor once, Cavuto had a point. Despite several attempts to launch conservative comedy as a thing (a new attempt is beginning as I type), comedy has remained the province of liberals, and they have expertly deployed its subversive and disarming effects to counter the awful effects of Fox News and conservative media. Look no further than Russell Brand, a comedian-turned-actor-turned political prankster who has used his YouTube series \u201cThe Trews\u201d to wage a one-man war on Fox News, bedeviling much of its staff in the process.\n\nBrand has become a sort of freelance ombudsman of Bill O\u2019Reilly and Sean Hannity, smacking them down on everything from Beyonce to immigration to ISIS to Ferguson. The videos, which gather millions of views, aren\u2019t just partisan hectoring. In fact, Brand openly says he likes O\u2019Reilly. Instead Brand uses comedy to deflate the pugnacious hosts before asking them to widen their worldviews.\n\nJust this week Brand took to his show to issue a line-by-line rebuttal of Sean Hannity\u2019s woeful interview with a witness to the McKinney pool party incident. Brand turned the tables on Hannity, saying, \u201cSean Hannity is laughable, Fox News is ridiculous, but the problems upon which they\u2019re reporting are serious.\u201d Needless to say, Fox does not care about Brand\u2019s brand of dissent. After months of back and forth, Brand actually secured a guest spot on Hannity\u2019s show, only to have the nighttime host cancel. When Brand showed up in front of 1211 Avenue of the Americas to film a bit for \u201cThe Trews,\u201d the security guards were having none of it, booting the actor from the premises. \u201cWe\u2019ll run this building one day,\u201d Brand promised them. \u201cAnd then, you know, we\u2019ll share it.\u201d (Brand\u2019s invitation for Hannity to appear on \u201cThe Trews\u201d has thus far gone unaccepted.)\n\nBrand isn\u2019t the only comedian to get booted from Fox headquarters. Comedian Lee Camp inaugurated the tradition in 2008 when he concluded a segment on \u201cFox & Friends Weekend\u201d with a dressing down of the entire network. Camp had been asked on to quip about the 2008 Democratic primary, and used his humor as a cover before sabotaging the segment.\n\n\u201cCould I just ask a question? What is Fox News?\u201d Camp asked host Clayton Morris. \u201cIt\u2019s just a parade of propaganda, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s just a festival of ignorance. A million people are dead in Iraq. Come on. This is ridiculous. What\u2019s the point of this?\u201d\n\n\u201cUm,\u201d said Morris.\n\nCamp turned to the camera and addressed the audience. \u201cThis is insane,\u201d he said. \u201cGo out! Leave your home. Go outside! Go hug your children! Love your family, you know? Do something with your life.\u201d\n\nThe sardonic comedian Sarah Silverman uses her foul-mouthed comedic aesthetic, disarmingly couched in a baby voice, to tell uncomfortable truths about conservatives\u2019 attempts to destroy female autonomy. Silverman also uses YouTube to battle right-wing rhetoric. Where Brand\u2019s videos resemble Jon Stewart\u2019s in their call and response with conservative rhetoric, Silverman\u2019s might be seen as precursors to John Oliver\u2019s lengthier discursions, in which a single issue is simultaneously satirized and dissected.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert aren't the only comedians who know how to stick it to Roger Ailes & company", "title": "Fox News can\u2019t take a joke: The best comedy takedowns of blowhard conservatives", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert aren't the only comedians who know how to stick it to Roger Ailes & company", "title": "Fox News can\u2019t take a joke: The best comedy takedowns of blowhard conservatives", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/06/21/fox_news_cant_take_a_joke_the_best_comedy_takedowns_of_blowhard_conservatives_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/11/sarah_silverman2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert aren't the only comedians who know how to stick it to Roger Ailes & company", "title": "Fox News can\u2019t take a joke: The best comedy takedowns of blowhard conservatives", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/11/sarah_silverman2.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Evan McMurry", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, AlterNet, Barack Obama, Fox News, Neil Cavuto, Russell Brand, Sarah Silverman", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Instead Brand uses comedy to deflate the pugnacious hosts before asking them to widen their worldviews.\nDo something with your life.\u201dThe sardonic comedian Sarah Silverman uses her foul-mouthed comedic aesthetic, disarmingly couched in a baby voice, to tell uncomfortable truths about conservatives\u2019 attempts to destroy female autonomy.\nFox Business\u2019 Neil Cavuto, however, saw the move as brilliant and encouraged his partymates to expand their comfort zone into the world of comedy.\nBrand has become a sort of freelance ombudsman of Bill O\u2019Reilly and Sean Hannity, smacking them down on everything from Beyonce to immigration to ISIS to Ferguson.\nBrand turned the tables on Hannity, saying, \u201cSean Hannity is laughable, Fox News is ridiculous, but the problems upon which they\u2019re reporting are serious.\u201d Needless to say, Fox does not care about Brand\u2019s brand of dissent."}
