The all-new 18-footer sits about three-quarters the size of the nameplate\u2019s largest offering. Yet the 186 packs plenty in its small frame. Equipped with an also-new Yamaha F-115 engine, it seats seven, showcases a perk-loaded instrument cluster and boasts a 20-gallon live well.\n\n\u201cThis is a great summer boat, family boat, fishing boat,\u201d said Shane Logsdon, sales associate. \u201cThis package is as much boat (that) you can get in the low $30,000s\u201d including motor and trailer. \u201cThat\u2019s the No. 1 selling feature.\u201d\n\nAs much design and engineering time went into developing the novel 186 Commander as Sea Fox\u2019s veteran 226 and 246 models, which are 22- and 24-footers respectively, he said. The 18-footer commands points for its overall safety; extra freeboard \u2014 the height of a ship\u2019s deck above the water level; wave shearing bow flare; and its smooth and dry ride.\n\n\u201cThis is the smallest model in the Commander series,\u201d Logsdon said. \u201cThere\u2019s a 199 (that was) redesigned into this boat.\u201d Sea Fox wanted to recraft the roughly 20-footer, he said, because \u201ccustomers were asking for an 18-foot boat\u201d and its shape didn\u2019t fit with the other Commanders. The 186 is the \u201csame Naval design and look as the 226 and 246,\u201d he said. \u201cThe 199 looks out of place.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, the 186 Commander\u2019s four-stroke, 115 horsepower F series engine from respected manufacturer Yamaha stands out \u201cbetter than the original,\u201d Logsdon said. Carrying a \u201cgreat weight ratio,\u201d the motor reaches 30 mph cruising speed at 4,400 revolutions per minute and top speed of 41 mph at 6,000 rpms. The 18-foot watercraft picks up pace rapidly. \u201cThe boat just flies out of the hole,\u201d he said. Yet the 186 Commander, which holds a 150 gallon tank, is fairly fuel efficient. \u201cOn any average day of boating, it only burns 10 gallons of gas.\u201d\n\nAccording to Logsdon, \u201cThis boat is definitely inshore. But it\u2019s capable of cruising in the ocean safely on nice days.\u201d The 186 Sea Fox performs \u201cperfect for Lowcountry water, rivers and harbor.\u201d\n\nLogsdon said the 18-foot Commander comes with an oversized center console capable of storing loads of safety gear while alternately providing space for a \u201cport-o-potty.\u201d The large access door contains a clever innovation, a magnetic strip to keep it stationary when opened.\n\nOne of the boat\u2019s top attractions is its comfortable seating configurations. Double cushioned chairs with recessed backs are built into the bow. A small bench can be folded down for fishing and flipped up to sit on for cruising. A number of drink holders encircle the deck. Another spiff unlike the competition: high \u201cgunnels,\u201d the upper edges of the boat\u2019s side, he said. \u201cFor children, it\u2019s nice and safe,\u201d he said. The raised sides also protect riders from spray splashing over the bow. \u201cLook how high we are off the water in an 18 foot boat,\u201d Logsdon said while manning the helm on a drive in Charleston Harbor. \u201cIt rides like a 21 (footer),\u201d he said.\n\nThe boat houses two live wells, including the 20-gallon tub, to keep catches. \u201cMost boats this size only have one.\u201d\n\nDuring a 15-minute excursion manning the helm, the new Sea Fox Commander 186 held its own alongside both larger ships and similar-sized craft. Sliding the throttle all the way forward gets the 115-hp Yamaha up to cruising speed with alacrity. It\u2019s almost as smooth generating extra power to reach top speed.\n\nMoving around the boat is rather easy, even though it\u2019s more contained than its lineup mates. The seating features are standout, notably the quite comfy reclining seats at the bow. The center console instrument layout proved easy to decipher, and a built-in Infinity radio with four speakers can blast out tunes.\n\nAmong other highlights, the 18-foot Sea Fox incorporates a foldable ladder, teak wood in the console\u2019s standing area and foldable aft jump seats that give fishermen plenty of room if they need it .\n\nIf there\u2019s any places to look for improvement, the boat could add a built-in cooler under the captain\u2019s bench rather than leaving space for a portable cooler. The steering was a little stiffer than in larger boats, even with a handy grab knob. And the boat would get jostled slightly in wakes and larger waves.\n\nYet the 186 Commander\u2019s shortcomings, if any, are small. Sea Fox looks to be on the right track toward marketing a popular, safety-conscious boat that would attract the complete novice as well as the old hand on deck.\n\nFor more information and photos, visit www.postandcourier.com/automotive.\n\nReach Jim Parker at 937-5542 or jparker@postandcourier.com.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Bang for your buck: Flexible seating, ample power at alluring price helps brand-new 18-foot Sea Fox duel larger rivals, \r\nAutomotive,", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "By JIM PARKER", "title": "Bang for your buck: Flexible seating, ample power at alluring price helps brand-new 18-foot Sea Fox duel larger rivals", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20150523/150529697/bang-for-your-buck-flexible-seating-ample-power-at-alluring-price-helps-brand-new-18-foot-sea-fox-duel-larger-rivals", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150523/PC2107/150529697/AR/0/AR-150529697.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150523/PC2107/150529697/AR/0/AR-150529697.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "By JIM PARKER", "title": "Bang for your buck: Flexible seating, ample power at alluring price helps brand-new 18-foot Sea Fox duel larger rivals", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@postandcourier", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150523/PC2107/150529697/AR/0/AR-150529697.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 150529697}}, "keywords": "Bang for your buck: Flexible seating, ample power at alluring price helps brand-new 18-foot Sea Fox duel larger rivals , \r\nAutomotive", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-23T00:01:00Z", "modified_time": "2015-05-22T18:17:00Z"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "By JIM PARKER"}, "article_summary": "This year Sea Fox introduced its 186 Commander, a 2016 edition now available at Palmetto Boat Sales in West Ashley.\n\u201cThis is a great summer boat, family boat, fishing boat,\u201d said Shane Logsdon, sales associate.\n\u201cMost boats this size only have one.\u201dDuring a 15-minute excursion manning the helm, the new Sea Fox Commander 186 held its own alongside both larger ships and similar-sized craft.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a 199 (that was) redesigned into this boat.\u201d Sea Fox wanted to recraft the roughly 20-footer, he said, because \u201ccustomers were asking for an 18-foot boat\u201d and its shape didn\u2019t fit with the other Commanders.\n\u201cLook how high we are off the water in an 18 foot boat,\u201d Logsdon said while manning the helm on a drive in Charleston Harbor."}
