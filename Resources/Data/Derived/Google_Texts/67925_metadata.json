But just in case, the administration floated a trial balloon in Politico this week, detailing how he could work around congressional opposition to help Islamic Republic:\n\nObama has broad powers to act alone \u2014 even against the will of Congress \u2014 say experts and former administration officials familiar with internal deliberations. Using his executive branch authority, Obama could effectively halt many U.S. sanctions on Iran, they say, in a bid to persuade Tehran to meet its end of the bargain.\n\nWhat does Politico mean by \u201ceven against the will of Congress?\u201d This isn\u2019t some unique wrinkle to this deal; it\u2019s how Washington works these days.\n\nObama has almost exclusively functioned \u201cagainst the will of Congress.\u201d It\u2019s somewhat ironic that the eponymous \u201cObamacare\u201d is essentially the sole achievement of this presidency secured with the help of legislators. Nothing, neither immigration nor climate change policy nor housing policy nor this Iranian deal, will have been crafted or approved by the legislative representatives of the American people with the proper checks and balances they deserve. And the framework for passage of the Iran deal, thanks to Republicans like Bob Corker, features a threshold higher than the filibuster which Democrats were constantly griping about when they held the majority.\n\nIt should be noted, that to some extent, the damage is already done. No matter what happens, the immediate downside is that international sanctions would be lifted, and Iran would be free to pursue its belligerent policies\u2014which is to say, it would simply do what Obama and United Nations have already agreed to allow the Iranian regime to do in the first place.\n\nBut does all this handwringing and bogus opposition to the Iran nuclear deal really matter if Barack Obama can do whatever he likes even if the Senate miraculously finds the votes to override his veto? It\u2019s not difficult to imagine Obama making the case that he needs to institute broad powers because so many of these #warmongering politicians have defected and forced his hand. But even as comfortable and skilled as Obama might be in exercising unilateral power, it seems implausible he could pull it off.\n\nFirst, a patchwork of actions could easily be undone should a Republican somehow win the presidency. (Yes, this necessitates that we imagine the GOP keeping its promises and winning elections.) Without an Iran-U.S. agreement, even a Democrat could far more easily reinstate sanctions once the Islamic Republic breaks any of the provisions in its deals UN. Domestic support for the deal is predicated on partisanship and the idea the very vague idea that diplomacy is always more productive than war. If neither of these factors are involved anymore, public support for boosting Iranian interests would complete crater.\n\nSecond, Obama would not only be forced to argue that he has wide discretion over existing legislation \u2014 as he always does\u2014but that he has the power to ignore the law and that he was ignoring that law based solely on a pinky swear Iran made to the United Nations. I doubt even he could get away with that,\n\nAs Politico points out, Obama would grant relief to Iranian banks and businesses by \u201cde-listing\u201d them as targets of the congressional law. Obama has argued that he can treat provisions punishing foreign institutions for doing business with Iran as \u201cnon-binding.\u201d (This is basically the president\u2019s position on all laws he dislikes.) But this strategy would likely open the deal up to an array of Constitutional lawsuits\u2014and even one loss would probably crater the entire strategy.\n\nThen, there is public opinion. Although Obama no longer has to concern himself with public support, the Democratic Party does have elections to contend with. And, as deal supporter Ruth Marcus wrote today, an embittered Obama isn\u2019t making a compelling argument. She\u2019s being kind. Obama\u2019s pitch is a hodgepodge of ad hominem attacks and ugly insinuations meant to intimidate those still on the fence. Polling since the agreement was announced shows that support for the deal has steadily eroded. The more specific the questions, the less support it enjoys. A recent poll of New York City voters by Quinnipiac University found that the agreement is opposed by 43 percent and supported by only 36 percent. If support for pro-Iranian policies continues to drop, even in liberal cities, and the Senate can override a veto, it would not only be a devastating defeat for Obama, but an unprecedented defeat for any president on foreign policy.", "article_metadata": {"item-publish-date": "Thu, 13 Aug 2015 08:23:22 EDT", "og": {"site_name": "The Federalist", "description": "Executing an Iran deal without Congress will make a big problem even bigger for Democrats.", "title": "No, Obama Can't Salvage The Iran Deal Without The Senate", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/John-Kerry-Iran-1024x716.jpg", "url": "http://thefederalist.com/2015/08/13/no-obama-cant-salvage-the-iran-deal-without-the-senate/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Federalist", "description": "Executing an Iran deal without Congress will make a big problem even bigger for Democrats.", "title": "No, Obama Can't Salvage The Iran Deal Without The Senate", "image": {"src": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/John-Kerry-Iran-1024x716.jpg"}, "creator": "@davidharsanyi", "site": "@FDRLST", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article": {"section": "World Affairs", "tag": "Barack Obama,Democratic Party,Democrats,Iran,Nuclear Deal,POlitico,Quinnipiac University", "published_time": "2015-08-13T08:23:22+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Executing an Iran deal without Congress will make a big problem even bigger for Democrats."}, "article_summary": "Executing an Iran deal without Congress will make a big problem even bigger for Democrats.\nAlthough Obama no longer has to concern himself with public support, the Democratic Party does have elections to contend with.\nAnd the framework for passage of the Iran deal, thanks to Republicans like Bob Corker, features a threshold higher than the filibuster which Democrats were constantly griping about when they held the majority.\nIt seems unlikely that Congress will deep-six Obama\u2019s nuclear deal with Iran.\nIf neither of these factors are involved anymore, public support for boosting Iranian interests would complete crater."}
