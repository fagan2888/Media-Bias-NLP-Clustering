Kevin Lundberg, R-Berthoud, and Tim Neville, R-Littleton, spoke out against the idea, saying it would have a \u201cdeleterious\u201d impact on their own rates.\n\n\u201cRepresenting Larimer County, I know what this bill will do if this is actually implemented and we do create a single region, and that is the medical premium costs for the people in Larimer County will go up,\u201d Lundberg said. \u201cThere\u2019s no question (premiums) are too high, but to simply take those costs and shift them around the state isn\u2019t going to fix the problem.\u201d\n\nLike Neville, Lundberg said the real problem is government involvement in health care, primarily through the federal Affordable Care Act.\n\nProponents of the measure, which was introduced by three Western Slope lawmakers, said the bill does nothing but study the issue. Why would anyone be opposed to getting information, they asked.\n\n\u201cI guess I\u2019m not sure why we have a problem getting information before we make further decisions that definitely impact my constituents on a daily basis,\u201d said Sen. Ellen Roberts, R-Durango. \u201cIt\u2019s a little confounding as to why you would not care about how life is for 80 percent of the state that is on the other side of the divide trying to make ends meet. Asking for a study on this is entirely appropriate.\u201d\n\nAccording to the sponsors of the bill, Sen. Kerry Donovan, D-Vail, and Reps. Millie Hamner, D-Frisco, and Bob Rankin, R-Carbondale, health premium costs for the mountainous parts of the state saw a 26 percent increase this year compared to an average of 9.8 percent statewide.\n\n\u201cThe reason we want a study to be conducted is because over the past handful of years we have been trying to figure out what is driving health care costs,\u201d Donovan said. \u201cIt has been like shouting these questions into a black box. We have not been able to get answers from anyone who is involved in this field as to why we might be seeing these costs and what possible solutions we might have.\u201d\n\nNeville said the reason is clear. The federal health care act has taken the free market out of the picture.\n\n\u201cI happen to be in the insurance business,\u201d Neville said. \u201cCan you imagine a bill that said all insurance companies must rate according to the state of Colorado on your auto insurance? It doesn\u2019t matter where you live. You live in a high-crime area, you live in a high-traffic area, you\u2019re going to pay the same amount on your auto insurance as somebody who lives in an area that has hardly any accidents, hardly any problems. This is a cost-shifting bill.\u201d\n\nThe measure, which requires the study to be completed by Aug. 1, needs a final Senate vote before it can head to the governor. It cleared the House on a 54-11 vote, with only Front Range Republicans opposing it.", "article_metadata": {"geo.region": "US-CO", "DC.identifier": "http://www.gjsentinel.com/news/articles/health-cost-study-stirs-little-interest/", "geo.placename": "Grand Junction", "description": "Grand Junction - Some Front Range Republicans don\u2019t like the idea of doing a study to see why some parts of the state have higher health care premiums", "geo.position": "39.0500,-108.5500", "DC.description": "Grand Junction - Some Front Range Republicans don\u2019t like the idea of doing a study to see why some parts of the state have higher health care premiums", "DC.format": "text/html", "DC.type": "Text", "robots": "index,follow,archive", "DC.publisher": "GJSentinel.com/The Grand Junction Daily Sentinel", "DC.date.valid": "2016-06-02T12:10:33-0600", "DC.creator": "Charles Ashby", "keywords": "Grand Junction Colorado breaking news photography business events sports high school real estate", "DC.date.created": "2016-04-19T18:48:28-0600", "DC.subject": "Grand Junction Colorado breaking news photography business events sports high school real estate", "DC.title": "Health cost study stirs little interest  |  GJSentinel.com", "DC.date.modified": "2016-04-20T14:31:29-0600", "DC.rights": "The Grand Junction Daily Sentinel"}, "article_summary": "Health cost study stirs little interestGOP legislators don't want spike in their premiumsSome Front Range Republicans don\u2019t like the idea of doing a study to see why some parts of the state have higher health care premiums than others.\nThe federal health care act has taken the free market out of the picture.\n\u201cThe reason we want a study to be conducted is because over the past handful of years we have been trying to figure out what is driving health care costs,\u201d Donovan said.\nProponents of the measure, which was introduced by three Western Slope lawmakers, said the bill does nothing but study the issue.\n\u201cCan you imagine a bill that said all insurance companies must rate according to the state of Colorado on your auto insurance?"}
