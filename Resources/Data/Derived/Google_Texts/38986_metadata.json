His friends are\n\nfurious at him, which breaks his heart.\n\nPhotograph by Nigel Parry\n\nJust after noon on June 18, Laurence H. Tribe, the nation\u2019s foremost scholar of constitutional law, fired off an angry and anguished self-defense. \u201cI just finished my roughly half-hour interview on WNYC with Brian Lehrer,\u201d he wrote in an email to the publishers of his most recent book about the Supreme Court, Uncertain Justice. \u201cI suppose I did well enough, but the interview was a complete disaster. Please let the Brian Lehrer Show know that I felt totally sandbagged.\u201d\n\nRelated Stories Why Is a Liberal Professor Helping Mitch McConnell Fight for Coal Companies?\n\nThe appearance had begun innocuously, with a discussion of the most recent Supreme Court decisions \u2014 what the Harvard Law professor later called June\u2019s \u201cseries of thunderclaps.\u201d Tribe\u2019s credentials as a liberal legal activist are the stuff of legend \u2014 counsel in Bush v. Gore, slayer of archconservative Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork \u2014 and he is as informed about the Court\u2019s opaque inner workings as any outsider can be. He taught Elena Kagan and John Roberts at Harvard and played an unusually involved role in Barack Obama\u2019s education in the law; for a brief time during Obama\u2019s first term, he served at the Justice Department. At 73, Tribe is accustomed to his preeminence. So he bristled when Lehrer courteously but insistently turned the conversation to his other role, as a highly compensated litigator for a coal company fighting Obama\u2019s climate-change initiative.\n\n\u201cCan a scholar take a client like that and maintain an appearance of independence?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ve been doing this kind of thing for decades,\u201d Tribe replied, the ice creeping into his voice. \u201cAnd I\u2019m just not for sale.\u201d He had the urge to hang up the phone then and there. But he fought it off and handled another 90 seconds of questioning with superficial aplomb. \u201cI have had a career that I\u2019m proud of. I\u2019ve represented causes that I believe in,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd whether I believe in the cause or not is not a function of whether the client is corporate or noncorporate.\u201d Inside, though, Tribe was churning. \u201cIt was an inexcusable ambush,\u201d he wrote immediately afterward, an \u201cawful caricature.\u201d He was flummoxed that people involved with a friendly NPR show would prove to be \u201csuch venomous snakes.\u201d\n\nTribe\u2019s emotions might seem extreme in light of the tenor of the conversation and the fact that he should have known the questions were inevitable. But the controversy over his role in the climate case had upended his place in the world, setting friends and colleagues against him and shaking two pillars of his reputation: his liberal idealism and his legal brilliance. The reversal dates to last year, when Tribe got involved in a constitutional challenge to Obama\u2019s plan to curtail power-plant carbon emissions. His client, Peabody Energy, is the world\u2019s largest private-sector coal company. The bare facts of the case concern dueling interpretations of an arcane passage of the Clean Air Act, but the political ramifications are monumental. Enemies of the climate initiative, which aims to cut emissions from the power sector by 30 percent from 2005 levels, see it as a naked abuse of executive power intended to put companies like Peabody out of business. Proponents say the new regulations fall well within the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s authority, and that the coal industry is destroying the planet.\n\n\u201cFor most environmental-law scholars, climate change is the challenge of our lifetime, it is an existential threat to life as we know it,\u201d says the UCLA law professor Ann Carlson, who has written that Tribe is \u201cdestroying his reputation\u201d as a constitutional theorist. \u201cI think the question is, how can Larry Tribe be attacking the president\u2019s climate-change policy in this way?\u201d Both sides of the carbon-regulation battle recognize that Tribe\u2019s name has currency. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has taken to citing the \u201ciconic left-leaning law professor.\u201d A pair of Harvard environmental-law experts, Jody Freeman and Richard Lazarus, singled out Tribe in a blog post on the university\u2019s own website, attacking his \u201csweeping assertions of unconstitutionality\u201d as \u201cridiculous.\u201d\n\n\u201cWere Professor Tribe\u2019s name not attached to them,\u201d they wrote, \u201cno one would take them seriously.\u201d The spectacle of a Harvard-faculty feud, along with reports of \u201cparticularly fierce\u201d anger emanating from the administration of Tribe\u2019s former student, served to escalate a dry dispute into political drama. Tribe has been fielding a deluge of emails from old friends and former students. \u201cThe ones that really hurt,\u201d Tribe told me, \u201care from people who, for whatever reason, took me as something of a role model, who are saying: \u2018What a disappointment. Why are you selling out to the coal industry? Don\u2019t you care about your grandchildren\u2019s future? You\u2019re helping to ruin the planet, and I\u2019m losing faith in you.\u2019 \u201d He has poured his lawyerly vehemence into long justifications sometimes punctuated by hopeful emoji: .\n\nIn early July, Tribe traveled to the Chautauqua Institution, a lakeside retreat in western New York that hosts a summer cultural festival, to give a lecture on the Supreme Court. \u201cThe Constitution is a great teacher,\u201d Tribe told the audience. \u201cIt expands our field of vision.\u201d He was especially invigorated by the recent Obergefell v. Hodges decision, which enshrined a constitutional right to marriage. Tribe defended gay rights before the cause was popular and took justifiable pride in the victory. \u201cAs I sat at home watching these events unfold,\u201d he said in his speech, \u201cI took out my small copy of the U.S. Constitution. Its words hadn\u2019t changed, but somehow it looked bigger.\u201d\n\nThen one audience member asked Tribe to defend his representation of \u201ccorporations in opposing provisions of the Clean Air Act.\u201d Another brought up the Koch brothers. (They are tangentially connected to another Tribe client, an organization fighting a wind-power plant.) \u201cIs there any constitutional basis,\u201d Tribe was asked, \u201cfor protecting our democracy and our environment from that kind of corruption?\u201d Tribe dutifully ticked off his defenses. He claims he only makes legal arguments he believes in, that more than half his cases are pro bono, that his quarrels with Obama are limited to this one policy, which he says is an unconstitutional power grab.\n\nFinally, sounding exasperated, he reprised an incendiary line: \u201cAs I\u2019ve said \u2014 some people said I was being a little melodramatic \u2014 I don\u2019t think burning the Constitution instead of coal will really be a way of saving the environment.\u201d\n\nTribe in the Oval Office, 2010. Photo: Courtesy of Laurence Tribe\n\nA few months before, on a steamy spring afternoon in Washington, I met Tribe at the Georgetown Ritz-Carlton. That morning, he had argued Peabody\u2019s case before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. He had just awoken from a nap, refreshed after his morning in court and a customary post-argument martini, which he\u2019d consumed over a lunchtime debriefing session with his clients at the Capital Grille. Now, amid a swirl of bankers and dignitaries in town for a global IMF summit, he told me that he bore Obama no ill will and even sympathized with his desire to act as his time in office ran short. \u201cPresidents have very limited power, even as commander-in-chief, and they all realize that, and therefore they champ at the bit,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m sure this climate initiative, at least as much as health care, is part of immortality for him. This is what he can do that can make a huge difference for generations. And I wish him well. I just wish he could find a constitutional way to do it.\u201d\n\nTribe has spent his career divining the entrails of the Supreme Court\u2019s opinions, parsing the signals it sends via asides and footnotes, and developing an understanding of each justice\u2019s view of the Constitution. He knows all of them personally, apart from Samuel Alito. That deep knowledge, in turn, has made him a fortune as an appellate attorney. Tribe sees no conflict between these roles, only a lucrative symbiosis. Like many liberal constitutional-law scholars, he is intellectually skeptical of the ways in which Obama \u2014 himself a liberal constitutional-law scholar \u2014 has sought to expand executive power. Some of his peers are dismayed by the president\u2019s assertion of the authority to summarily execute American-born terrorists with drones, his sweeping up of phone data, and his continued detention of prisoners at Guant\u00e1namo. Tribe has picked a much more unpopular place to make a stand, but he says that the truth, however unpleasant, is that the Constitution contains rights for coal companies, too.\n\nTribe has argued 35 cases before the Supreme Court, winning well over half of them, and is frequently hired to handle appeals in lower courts. Once a champion collegiate debater, he relishes the rush of oral arguments. He doesn\u2019t like rehearsing \u2014 he eschewed moot courts for years, thinking they would dull his edge of anxiety. Before a case, he often lies awake at night, testing out inventive lines of argument in his head. \u201cHis recall and understanding of the relationship between things in constitutional law is almost beyond comprehension,\u201d says Tom Goldstein, publisher of SCOTUSblog, who collaborated on appellate cases with Tribe for years.\n\nSometimes connections come to him in a flash. One night, shortly before he was to appear before the appeals court on Peabody\u2019s behalf, he thought up an answer to the government\u2019s strongest argument, the contention that it was not yet possible to judge the EPA\u2019s rule because it was not finalized. Sure enough, at the hearing, it took less than a minute for Judge Thomas Griffith to pose the question: \u201cDo you know of any case in which we have halted a proposed rulemaking?\u201d When it came time for Tribe to offer his answer, he reached back four decades to cite U.S. v. Jackson, a decision about guilty pleas and the death penalty, which he had helped to craft as clerk to Justice Potter Stewart.\n\n\u201cOne needn\u2019t wait to see if the guillotine drops,\u201d Tribe said.\n\nThe metaphor might seem histrionic, but Tribe argues that the mere threat of regulation poses catastrophic risks to the coal industry. The U.S. energy market\u2019s reliance on coal-fired power plants has been shrinking because of cheap natural gas from fracking and pressure from environmental groups. Peabody\u2019s stock price has plunged by 97 percent over the past four years, and many smaller coal companies have gone bankrupt. The industry argues that the new carbon-emissions standards will cause more plants to close, raising rates for consumers and disproportionately harming the more coal-dependent states. In filings on behalf of Peabody, Tribe argues that the EPA\u2019s action is \u201caimed squarely at stamping out coal.\u201d Environmental advocates say he\u2019s exactly right.\n\nFor this reason, the courtroom was packed with energy and environmental lobbyists. Lazarus and Freeman sat side by side in a reserved row, scribbling notes. Everyone involved recognized that this particular lawsuit was a long shot. (Ultimately, the court would end up rejecting it on the narrow grounds of its being premature.) But the antagonists were treating the argument like the first round in a prizefight \u2014 a chance to throw a few jabs, probe weaknesses, and test lines of attack. The dispute will almost certainly end up before the Supreme Court, soon. The panel of three Republican-appointed judges sounded unsympathetic to the EPA. They were constrained, however, by a key precedent, derived from Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council, which holds that agencies are entitled to deference when it comes to interpreting laws.\n\n\u201cIf I saw two absolutely conflicting positions,\u201d Griffith said, \u201cthen it is Chevron, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cI would try to look at that decision and read it more narrowly,\u201d Tribe replied, \u201cin order to avoid accusing the Supreme Court of not knowing how to read the Constitution.\u201d\n\nTribe has made some sweeping constitutional claims, accusing the EPA of violating the Fifth and Tenth Amendments by bullying private businesses and state regulators. But much of the argument in court focused on an esoteric issue involving the wording of the Clean Air Act as it was amended during the first Bush administration. In a situation reminiscent of the most recent Obamacare fight, King v. Burwell, the 1990 amendments had never been properly reconciled by Congress and thus contained two versions of Section 111(d). The bizarre mistake had taken on importance only decades later, when the EPA decided to use the provision to regulate carbon from power plants. Tribe argued that Congress never intended to slip a massive expansion of federal regulation into what might be viewed as the legislative equivalent of a typo.\n\nEven defenders of the EPA recognized that the wording presented a problem: Though the version they preferred appeared to give the agency clear authority, the other was more ambiguous. The Clean Air Act is a clunky device for regulating carbon \u2014 that\u2019s the reason Obama had first pressed for his cap-and-trade plan, which would have established a market-based system through congressional legislation. Still, a 2007 Supreme Court decision expressly allowed the EPA to treat carbon as a pollutant, and Tribe\u2019s opponents couldn\u2019t fathom how he had managed to escalate a statutory quibble into a crisis on a par with notorious abuses of executive power, like Harry Truman\u2019s seizure of the steel mills.\n\nFreeman says she felt \u201cawkward\u201d criticizing a colleague she otherwise respects but that she was obliged to speak out against what she sees as misleading rhetoric. \u201cThe worst of it is no one will stop and ask about the quality of his arguments,\u201d Freeman says. \u201cThey just hear Larry Tribe say that the Constitution is \u2018burning,\u2019 and they take it on faith. It\u2019s like Yoda has spoken. I\u2019m not saying the EPA\u2019s power-plant rule is perfect \u2014 it\u2019s not. But ask anyone with any real expertise in this area, and they will tell you that the constitutional claims are fictions of the coal industry\u2019s imagination.\u201d\n\nIn 1977, when he was 36 years old, Tribe took on the gargantuan project that established his reputation: a treatise that sought to synthesize everything there was to know about the Constitution. He wrote in a manic frenzy of productivity, an eight-month flurry of all-nighters. Harvard set up a bank of 11 typewriters for him, because he couldn\u2019t manage to change a ribbon. Tribe was a Ph.D. student in mathematics before he turned to the law, and his method in analyzing the law was Newtonian, reducing its workings to seven \u201cmodels.\u201d In his scholarship, he often seeks to apply abstruse principles from physics. His 2008 book The Invisible Constitution explores the unstated principles that \u201canimate and undergird\u201d the written text like \u201cdark matter.\u201d In the 1980s, he wrote an article called \u201cThe Curvature of Constitutional Space\u201d with assistance from Barack Obama, seeking to investigate what the law\u2019s \u201ccontours mean for those who might be trapped or excluded by them.\u201d\n\nTribe has devoted his studies to probing what he has called \u201cconstitutional silences,\u201d in part through an expansive reading of the Ninth Amendment, which says that the rights provided by the Constitution are not limited to the ones it specifically enumerates. In 1987, he faced down his ideological opposite in the figure of Robert Bork, who likened the Ninth Amendment to a mere \u201cinkblot.\u201d Tribe had been laying the groundwork for opposition to Ronald Reagan\u2019s Supreme Court nominees \u2014 before Bork was selected, he published a book arguing that judicial selection was \u201ctoo important a task to be left to any president\u201d \u2014 and he played a starring role at Bork\u2019s confirmation hearings, offering damning testimony. At the time, Tribe was widely seen as destined for the Supreme Court one day himself, and the conventional wisdom, perhaps oversimplified, is that in helping to foil Bork, he sacrificed his own chances of ever being nominated.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the reason why he\u2019s an iconic figure,\u201d says Bob Shrum, Tribe\u2019s friend and a political consultant to Senator Ted Kennedy, who helped to rally Senate opposition to Bork. \u201cI said to him, look, you have to make this decision yourself, but if you do this, you have to be aware that a lot of Republicans who don\u2019t agree with you, but kind of respect you, will never, ever, agree to put you on the Supreme Court.\u201d Tribe\u2019s admirers wonder how history might have unfolded if he had heeded his friend\u2019s warning.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very counterfactual,\u201d Tribe told me. \u201cBecause had I not testified against Bork, I might not have been as fervently embraced by liberals as I came to be. Until recently.\u201d\n\nInstead of serving on the Court, Tribe continued to serve as its interpreter from his lofty perch in Cambridge. He is one of two dozen Harvard faculty members who hold the title \u201cuniversity professor.\u201d Generations of students have competed for precious slots in Tribe\u2019s classes and the beneficence of his attention. \u201cI think I have thousands of children,\u201d Tribe says. (His two biological children are both artists.) He told me he sees that patrimonial influence as one of the two most important components of his legacy. The other is his advocacy for expanded rights.\n\nTribe\u2019s most historically meaningful argument may be one he lost. In 1986, in the case Bowers v. Hardwick, he represented an Atlanta bartender named Michael Hardwick before the Court. Hardwick had been charged with sodomy after police came to serve him with an unrelated warrant and discovered him in his bedroom with another man. Tribe hoped to convince the swing vote, Justice Lewis Powell, that the sodomy law violated the unenumerated right to privacy. After some vacillation, though, Powell sided against him, writing in an internal memo that the assertion that there was no difference between gay and heterosexual relationships was typical of \u201cProfessor Tribe, with his usual overblown rhetoric.\u201d\n\nThe next year, Powell announced his retirement, and Reagan picked Bork to replace him. After Bork\u2019s rejection, Reagan appointed Anthony Kennedy instead; Tribe testified in favor. Kennedy wrote this year\u2019s gay-marriage opinion, as well as the 2013 opinion that paved the way for it and the 2003 opinion that declared sodomy laws unconstitutional. He also wrote the 1996 opinion in a pivotal case that struck down an anti-gay Colorado initiative, holding that a state cannot \u201cdeem a class of persons a stranger to its laws.\u201d The opinion\u2019s wording closely resembled that of an amicus brief written by Tribe. Today, Tribe calls Kennedy one of the Court\u2019s greatest justices \u2014 an assessment not entirely free of self-identification.\n\nAll along, though, Tribe also took highly lucrative cases representing corporate clients. \u201cI did decide that I would never do something just for the money, and I would turn down lots of offers,\u201d Tribe says. Tobacco companies, for instance. \u201cI mean, if I had all the money from all the cases that I turned down, I\u2019d have ten times as much as I have now.\u201d As the Columbia University law professor Tim Wu recounted in a recent New Yorker blog post, Tribe has made the case against net neutrality on behalf of his client Time Warner and has challenged aspects of hazardous-waste-cleanup laws on behalf of General Electric. He has represented Nike in a case related to overseas sweatshops. In the 1980s, he represented criminal defendants like Michael Milken and the Reverend Sun Myung Moon. Tribe says that he took these cases because, to him, each raised important legal issues, such as a corporation\u2019s right to a fair hearing in the case of G.E., or prosecutorial abuses in the case of Milken.\n\nIn 1994, an American Lawyer article titled \u201cThe Croesus of Cambridge\u201d described how Tribe had built an informal but thriving law practice, charging as much as $1,200 an hour. One Supreme Court argument alone, in the 1987 case Pennzoil v. Texaco \u2014 involving what was then the largest civil judgment in history \u2014 earned him a reported fee of $3 million. \u201cIn general, it was like, \u2018Hey, we love practicing the law, that\u2019s what we do, and they pay us for that, handsomely,\u2019 \u201d says Brian Koukoutchos, who was a research assistant to Tribe and continued to work with him as a lawyer after he graduated. \u201cHaving paying clients,\u201d he says, \u201callows you the luxury of being able to take on clients that can\u2019t pay.\u201d Today, Tribe works mainly with another former research assistant, Jonathan Massey, who has a boutique appellate-law firm in Washington, which touts Tribe\u2019s corporate work on its website. Massey is co-counsel with Tribe on the Peabody case.\n\nThe largeness of Tribe\u2019s reputation, and fortune, made him an equally large target when he came out in opposition to Obama\u2019s climate plan. \u201cThere\u2019s an enormous amount of jealousy in the Harvard faculty,\u201d says his longtime colleague Alan Dershowitz, who helped to rally a group of legal luminaries to write in Tribe\u2019s defense in the Boston Globe. \u201cHe\u2019s a university professor, he\u2019s made a lot of money, he\u2019s very well known.\u201d In 2005, the law school\u2019s Drama Society put on a satirical musical skit, \u201cI\u2019m Larry Tribe,\u201d set to the tune of \u201cI Will Survive.\u201d An actress playing Elena Kagan, then the school\u2019s dean, sang:\n\nHe\u2019s ten feet tall!\n\nHe learned to fly!\n\nAnd though he\u2019ll never be a Justice\n\nHe\u2019s never gonna die\n\nHe is the sultan of Sudan\n\nHe is the closer for the Sox\n\nAnd the legal fees he charges\n\nMake him richer than Fort Knox!\n\nThe affection between Tribe and Kagan is real and long-standing. For a time after her graduation, she lived in the finished basement of his family\u2019s 19th-century frame house off Brattle Street. But Tribe has said that among all his students, none was finer than Barack Obama. It is a measure of Obama\u2019s easygoing ambition that soon after he arrived at Harvard Law, he sought out its most prominent faculty member. Tribe marked the day of their first meeting on his calendar with an exclamation point. Obama helped him to write the physics article and a book about abortion. They would talk through case law while taking long walks along the Charles River.\n\nTribe remained in touch with Obama after he graduated and was one of his early political champions. He introduced his \u201cinspiring\u201d former student to the people of Iowa in a 2007 campaign ad. On the night of the 2008 election, Tribe emotionally embraced Obama in Grant Park. \u201cAs a nation,\u201d he wrote in a blog post the next morning, \u201cwe have come of age.\u201d In anticipation of an influential role in the new administration, Tribe prepared to move to Washington. When he got there, however, he discovered that Obama hadn\u2019t changed politics. \u201cIt\u2019s not just all the terrible things that people say behind each other\u2019s backs,\u201d Tribe says. \u201cIt\u2019s how jealous people are of their turf, even when you are part of the same administration.\u201d\n\nTribe was offered assurances of a high-level job. In 2009, he wrote a private letter to Obama suggesting a \u201cnewly created DOJ position dealing with the rule of law.\u201d He seemed like an ideal candidate to sort out dilemmas like Guant\u00e1namo. \u201cI thought that for me to be giving broader advice on constitutional issues would make sense,\u201d Tribe says. \u201cBut it was clear that was stepping on people\u2019s toes.\u201d He instead took a nebulous Justice Department job, \u201csenior counselor for access to justice,\u201d and did grassroots work like aiding homeowners facing foreclosure. Still, some colleagues remained resentful of his relationship with the president. Obama occasionally summoned him to the Oval Office to talk about abstract issues of law, but even those rare interactions created friction.\n\n\u201cRahm Emanuel pulled me aside at a party at the W Hotel,\u201d Tribe recalls. \u201cHe said, \u2018I heard you went to the Big Guy behind my back.\u2019 \u201d\n\nTribe was dealing with health problems, complications from an earlier surgery to treat a benign brain tumor, as well as the emotion and expense of what he described in the Washington Post as \u201ca very contentious divorce\u201d from his wife of four decades. (He told the Post that Kagan was one of his few confidantes.) But the low point came in the form of a leak. A blog obtained that 2009 letter to the president in which Tribe had mainly addressed the subject of future Supreme Court appointments, offering praise for Kagan and an uncharacteristically harsh assessment of another leading candidate, Sonia Sotomayor. \u201cBluntly put, she\u2019s not nearly as smart as she seems to think she is,\u201d he wrote, \u201cand her reputation for being something of a bully could well make her liberal impulses backfire.\u201d\n\n\u201cI could hardly have been more wrong, and it was foolish of me,\u201d Tribe told me. (In Uncertain Justice, he is conspicuously complimentary of Sotomayor, calling her a \u201cjudge\u2019s judge\u201d and comparing her to Earl Warren.) Kagan and Sotomayor were both on the Court by the time the letter emerged in late 2010, so it only served to damage its author. Citing his health, Tribe soon resigned. \u201cI assume someone in the administration leaked it to injure Larry,\u201d Tom Goldstein says. He believes the letter had to be understood in the context of Tribe\u2019s relationship to Kagan. \u201cIt\u2019s just Larry being unbelievably loyal, and somewhat tone-deaf to the prospect that someone could use it to hurt him later on,\u201d he says. \u201cHe is a thinker, not a maneuverer, and that means he can very easily be outmaneuvered.\u201d\n\nTribe told me he hasn\u2019t spoken to the president in almost four years and hasn\u2019t had any direct communication with the White House about the EPA case. \u201cIt\u2019s all mean anonymous quotes,\u201d he says. But he would very much like to know how Obama regards him today. \u201cDo you really think that Barack or people close to him are pissed at me?\u201d Tribe recalls asking his former research assistant Ron Klain, who was Vice-President Biden\u2019s chief of staff. \u201cHe said, \u2018No, I think they realize that your credibility when you\u2019re on their side is enhanced by the fact that you\u2019re not always on their side.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s assuming a largeness of spirit,\u201d he says, \u201cthat may or may not be there.\u201d\n\nWhile representing the coal industry had caused Tribe personal pain, it has been good for his personal business. Lately, he\u2019s been getting many calls about regulation cases. One new client is a New York real-estate investor who wants to challenge the city\u2019s plan to rezone part of midtown, arguing it would devalue his air rights. Another is the American Clinical Laboratory Association, which is fighting a Food and Drug Administration effort to expand its regulatory power over certain types of medical tests.\n\n\u201cSome of my best friends have severe, metastatic cancer, and they\u2019re depending on rapidly evolving lab tests, and they\u2019re going to be killed by what the FDA wants to do,\u201d Tribe told me over lunch one day in Washington, where he was to speak to the laboratory association\u2019s annual convention. He later shared the dais with Paul Clement, probably the foremost conservative Supreme Court advocate. \u201cIf Larry and I agree,\u201d Clement told the audience, \u201cthat right there ought to give you some comfort.\u201d Tribe called the FDA\u2019s case for regulation a \u201cfairy tale\u201d and issued a dire warning about its import. \u201cWhat I fear down the line, if the FDA succeeds in getting the camel\u2019s nose under the tent here, is a federalization of the practice of medicine.\u201d\n\nThere has always been an anti-regulatory component to Tribe\u2019s thinking. As far back as the 1980s, he was decrying the \u201ctrend toward granting bureaucrats and professionals ever-increasing power over our lives and liberties.\u201d For decades, this strand of consistency has allowed Tribe to balance the roles of liberal and litigator without internal conflicts or much public criticism. And though Harvard is one of the country\u2019s highest-paying universities, Tribe has always felt the need to supplement his income. \u201cI wasn\u2019t in a position to turn down money when I believed in the case,\u201d he told me. Like many people who grew up without money, he has always worried about it.\n\nTribe entered Harvard at 16 as a scholarship student, worked in the kitchens, and was tormented by his older roommates, who had gone to schools like Andover and Exeter. His father, born George Israel Tribuch, never made more than $15,000 a year as a car salesman. The family immigrated to San Francisco, when Tribe was 5. They came from Shanghai, which had a beleaguered little community of Jews who had moved east to escape pogroms and, later, Hitler. Tribe claims that he has a vivid memory of a day when he was about 2 and his father was taken away to an internment camp by the occupying Japanese. \u201cThat imprinted the feeling,\u201d he says, \u201cthat there must be something wrong when people can be hurt for no reason.\u201d\n\nAs Tribe would be the first to say, though, originalism has its explanatory limits. Why, of all the injustices in the world, would he expend his own valuable energy fighting rules on carbon emissions? Even many of Tribe\u2019s friends have trouble answering that question. \u201cMaybe some people are willing to embrace the idea that the end justifies the means in constitutional law,\u201d Tribe said one morning over breakfast in Chautauqua. But he says he thinks in terms of rights, not outcomes. When he wrote about environmental protection early in his career, he proposed creating \u201crights for natural objects.\u201d He has argued that laboratory chimpanzees should have the right to sue for habeas corpus. He has come to the conclusion, reluctantly, that the Second Amendment protects the rights of individual gun owners, within reason. He does not discount the idea that corporations have a right to political speech and takes a measured view of the Citizens United decision.\n\n\u201cLarry believes in a big Constitution,\u201d Goldstein says. \u201cA big Constitution can protect a lot of little guys, and it can protect a lot of big companies.\u201d\n\nTribe\u2019s relationship to the Constitution can seem sentimental \u2014 even empathic. He once wrote that before his first Supreme Court argument, shortly after his father\u2019s sudden death, he saw a shooting star, which he took to be his father\u2019s spirit, and he began to associate the apparition with the Constitution\u2019s \u201caffirmation of rights unwritten and unseen.\u201d In March, when Tribe testified against the EPA plan at a House subcommittee hearing, he staked out his position in romantic terms. \u201cA lot of my friends tell me, \u2018Look, don\u2019t be an idealist, don\u2019t be utopian,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201c \u2018Congress isn\u2019t going to do anything, so why are you so hot about the EPA violating the law and the Constitution?\u2019 Well, it is just, I guess, the way I was brought up. I think the law and the Constitution matter.\u201d\n\nThe Republicans on the subcommittee fawned over the esteemed Professor Tribe. Environmental advocates suggest that he really has no case, that the coal industry is trying to stall, spreading doubt that might cast a pall over an important round of international climate negotiations this fall. Over the horizon looms the possibility of a Republican president. \u201cThe constitutional arguments that Tribe is making are not serious arguments,\u201d says Richard Revesz, a New York University professor who sparred with Tribe at the hearing, pointing out that the EPA has been regulating air quality for 45 years. \u201cThey are weak arguments, and they are not being made to win this case. They\u2019re basically being made to mislead the public and weaken the president.\u201d C. Boyden Gray, who helped to draw up the 1990 Clean Air Act amendments as counsel to the first President Bush, and now represents many energy-industry clients as an attorney in private practice, told me in June, after the initial case was dismissed, that there were many legal arguments to be made against the EPA carbon regulations \u2014 but he wasn\u2019t convinced by Tribe\u2019s. \u201cYou look at Revesz,\u201d he says, \u201cand you say, \u2018My God, that is pretty persuasive.\u201d (On behalf of a client, however, Gray has since filed a federal appeals court brief endorsing Tribe\u2019s position.)\n\nWhy would someone as acclaimed and intelligent as Tribe advance a case that even some serious Republicans have treated skeptically? One possibility is that he is doing it for the money alone, but those who have worked with him say that\u2019s not how he operates. \u201cLarry doesn\u2019t take cases out of a sense that they are fashionable,\u201d says Kathleen Sullivan, a former student who collaborated with him on the Bowers case as a Harvard professor and went on to become dean of Stanford\u2019s law school. \u201cHe takes them because he profoundly believes in the essence of the argument.\u201d Some critics suggest that Tribe\u2019s problems emanate from this stubborn insistence on sincerity. Why could he not just admit what seems obvious to them: that, after all, he is just a lawyer? \u201cThey would like that, because they think that would reduce the academic patina,\u201d Tribe says. \u201cBut it would also be false.\u201d\n\nAnother potential explanation was set forth by Tim Wu, who was willing to accept that Tribe genuinely held his opinions but articulated \u201cthe suspicion that Tribe might well hold different, if equally sincere, beliefs had he not been loyally representing so many corporate defendants for so long.\u201d The problem, Wu suggested, was not that Tribe didn\u2019t believe his arguments but that he really did. From Tribe\u2019s perspective, this accusation is the most infuriating \u2014 he can\u2019t refute the claim that his own mind is captured.\n\nThere\u2019s also the possibility that Tribe simply understands the Constitution better than his adversaries. In the end, he only has to win over one audience, and he thinks the Supreme Court is ready to listen to his opinion. Roberts, who has called bureaucracy \u201cthe headless fourth branch of government,\u201d seems eager to mount an offensive against the regulatory state. Though Roberts voted against the plaintiffs in King v. Burwell, his opinion included a sharp rejection of the Chevron deference principle \u2014 a seed of reasoning that could eventually blossom into anti-regulatory doctrine. \u201cThere are strategic justices who play four-dimensional chess,\u201d Tribe says. \u201cRoberts is clearly like that.\u201d\n\nThough Tribe calls Roberts \u201ccanny,\u201d he has been sharply critical of his Court\u2019s conservative direction on many issues. He says that some of the chief justice\u2019s colleagues complain about his style. (\u201cThey all loved Rehnquist, and they don\u2019t all love Roberts.\u201d) He sometimes jokes that, in contrast to other students, Roberts seems not to have absorbed all of his class material. So it is a bit ironic that Tribe is now pinning his hopes for vindication on the Court\u2019s right wing. But life, like the Constitution, is always evolving in interesting new directions, and Tribe thinks that the wind of the Court\u2019s opinion is at his back.\n\nIn June, after the Obamacare decision, I forwarded Tribe the link to an article in the publication Greenwire that raised the possibility that the same reasoning that benefited Obama on health care might serve to foil his climate policy. He replied:\n\n*This article appears in the July 27, 2015 issue of New York Magazine.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#000", "description": "Laurence Tribe is fighting the White House on behalf of Big Coal.
