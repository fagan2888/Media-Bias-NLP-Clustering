Don't transfuse red blood cells in hemodynamically stable, non-bleeding critically ill patients with a hemoglobin concentration greater than 7 mg/dL. Avoid parenteral nutrition in adequately nourished critically ill patients within the first seven days of a stay in an intensive care unit. Don't deeply sedate mechanically ventilated patients without a specific indication, and without daily attempts to lighten sedation. Offer patients at high risk for death or severely impaired functional recovery and their families the alternative of care focused entirely on comfort before continuing life support.\n\nA 10-member team with representatives from internal medicine, surgery, anesthesiology, emergency medicine and critical care nursing disciplines compiled the list, according to the announcement. The recommendations add to the log of more than 220 tests and procedures that the teams identified as possibly unnecessary and harmful.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here's the announcement\n\n- read the recommendations (.pdf)\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n10 ways to eliminate wasteful medical tests and procedures\n\nMedical groups call out 90 more over-used, unnecessary treatments\n\nDoc groups pinpoint top sources of unnecessary care\n\n'Shaming' docs to reduce inappropriate imaging?
