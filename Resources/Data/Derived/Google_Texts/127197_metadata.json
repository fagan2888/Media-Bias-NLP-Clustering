They are all evacuees of the Valley Fire. ( April Dembosky/KQED )\n\nKay Ashley is celebrating her 47th birthday at the Valley Fire evacuation site on the Napa County Fairgrounds. She and a group of her friends, all musicians, set up some amps and microphones in the bleachers at the Calistoga Speedway.\n\nThey let Ashley take a few solos first, and she plays one of her songs, \u201cLong Tall Man.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy heart is trembling. My heart is trembling,\u201d she sings in a low alto.\n\nOn this birthday, gifts aren\u2019t on her mind. Rather, a list of things she\u2019s lost.\n\n\u201cI lost several guitars. A mandolin that my father built,\u201d she says. \u201cA tamboura from India. Ukulele, piano.\u201d\n\nHer friend rescued her cat. But Ashley\u2019s pretty sure everything else is gone. She says playing music out here is helping her keep her sanity.\n\n\u201cPlaying the guitar, strumming the strings, feeling the vibration. It\u2019s like, working it out. Moving the energy.\u201d\n\nThese musicians know each other from Harbin Hot Springs, the New Age resort that was mostly destroyed in the fire. Together, they\u2019re mourning the loss of a place they considered spiritual and sacred.\n\n\u201cLocking in with music is like locking in with the fabric of everything, and it\u2019s a way to stay present,\u201d Ashley says. \u201cIt\u2019s a way to not panic about what has happened or what\u2019s going to happen. It\u2019s grounding.\u201d\n\nAshley knows this emotional landscape. In 2001, she lived in New York City and worked at the World Trade Center. She wasn\u2019t at work on Sept. 11; but many people she knew were and were killed. Ten years later, she moved to Harbin Hot Springs.\n\n\u201cThe years I remained in New York I didn\u2019t heal. I was just numb,\u201d she says. \u201cI was shut down in fundamental ways for a very long time. And my healing really started when I got away from New York.\u201d\n\nNow she\u2019s trying to wrap her head around a double anniversary. The Valley Fire broke out on Sept. 12.\n\n\u201cThe day after the anniversary. This place I came to heal and grow, Harbin Hot Springs, is ash,\u201d she says. \u201cJust like Lower Manhattan was.\u201d\n\nAshley says, at the evacuation center, music has been healing for her, and for others.\n\nA guy has been walking around the tent city singing and letting people play his guitar. There have been spontaneous drum circles and Beatles sing-a-longs. Also, a lot of renditions of the Janis Joplin classic, Me and Bobby McGee \u2014 especially the refrain, \u201cFreedom\u2019s just another word for nothing left to lose.\u201d\n\nAshley\u2019s taking the cue.\n\n\u201cI feel strangely relieved and free,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s so shocking to have everything go so quickly. And now, I\u2019m free.\u201d\n\nShe had rented her house and didn\u2019t have insurance. While others are vowing to rebuild, she\u2019s thinking about moving on.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m feeling like wow, if I can get a minivan, I\u2019m just going to hit the road and just play music all the time, you know, why not?\u201d she says.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"It\u2019s a way to not panic about what has happened or what\u2019s going to happen.
