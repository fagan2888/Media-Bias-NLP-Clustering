The 17-track Silverback Gorilla 2 is a fresh take on Sheek\u2019s beast mode theme presented in previous works such as 2008\u2019s Silverback Gorilla, 2010\u2019s Donnie G: Don Gorilla, and the 2015 SBG2 precursor Gorillaween mixtape.\n\nThis time the New York native wanted to provide listeners with a different approach on street-centered Hip Hop by offering both soul sounding beats and head bangers. Longtime fans should not be too concerned about the East Coast spitter abandoning the lyrical focus established on cuts as a member of The Lox and Wu Block. As Sheek puts it, he\u2019s still \u201csaying some sh*t.\u201d\n\nDonnie G is not the only high level emcee bringing the bars on Silverback Gorilla 2. His Lox brethren Jadakiss and Styles P make appearances as well as his Wu Block partner Ghostface Killah. In addition, Sheek drafts Swizz Beatz, Pusha T, Fabolous, A$AP Ferg, Joell Ortiz, Raheem DeVaughn, and others for contributions to the LP.\n\nAllHipHop.com caught up with Sheek Louch to get some insight into his new album. Besides speaking on SBG2, the D-Block Records representative touches on working with Ghostface and the lack of respect for rap music pioneers. He also confirms a reunited Puff Daddy & The Family will be hitting the road together in early 2016.\n\n[ALSO READ: Dame Grease & DJ King Assassin Ft. Sheek Louch, Pusha T & Freeway \u2013 \u201cMy Style\u201d]\n\nYou decided to name this project Silverback Gorilla 2. Do you consider the first one your best body of work and that\u2019s why you wanted to do a sequel?\n\nNot at all. I called it that, because I wanted to get back into beast mode. I wanted to get back into that gritty sound. When I\u2019m on my gorilla sh*t, I\u2019m not trying to be the Black Panthers. My frame of thought is I\u2019m in that beast mode in this jungle out here.\n\nYou have The Lox on the album. You have Fab, Pusha T, and a bunch of other artists. You also have A$AP Ferg. He\u2019s part of the new breed of New York rappers. What was it about Ferg that made you want to work with him?\n\nShout out to the whole A$AP Mob. They are the new breed. It\u2019s [Ferg\u2019s] energy he brings on all of his songs. Being on tour together and seeing him tear that stage down, I could just hear him on it. I was like, \u201cThis song right here. This is sick.\u201d I was in the studio with Kiss, and he said, \u201cI got to get on that record. Call Ferg now.\u201d Ferg just delivered. He was bringing that youth to it.\n\nYou also have Ghostface on the album. You guys have worked together a lot. What is it like working with him?\n\nThat\u2019s my brother. All we do is tour the world together. We just got back from Mexico City. We\u2019re like the same kind of guys \u2013 big dudes, same energy. First of all, I\u2019m a fan of everybody on my album, but definitely the Wu-Tang Clan. Ghost delivers by painting that picture. He\u2019s just so vivid with the sh*t. You got to love him when he spits that sh*t. He delivers. I love it.\n\nI can\u2019t even imagine that vibe in the studio. That has to be crazy.\n\nIt\u2019s crazy. I\u2019m a fan, because when you hear Ghost and Chef [Raekwon] talk, they sound like the skits from the old albums. They still talk like that. It sounds like you\u2019re listening to those old albums when you\u2019re sitting there talking about regular sh*t. It could be, \u201cWhat food are we gonna order?\u201d And it\u2019s like, \u201cYo, yo, son. I\u2019m thinking about the\u2026\u201d I\u2019m thinking, \u201cThese n*ggas are crazy.\u201d [laughs] But the energy in there is crazy.\n\nThat makes me think of that video Ghostface put up that had the internet going crazy. It was like he was serious, but he was joking at the same time.\n\nAgainst Action [Bronson]? You see what I\u2019m talking about? That\u2019s kind of what I\u2019m saying. He\u2019s serious, but his whole sh*t is \u201cI\u2019ll send them shooters.\u201d It\u2019s like, \u201cThis guy is a nut.\u201d [laughs] That\u2019s my brother!\n\nYou released the track \u201cMemory Lane\u201d earlier this year. We posted that on the site, and the feedback was crazy. There was one part that stood out for me. That was when you were talking about new school rappers rapping over 90\u2019s beats. Do you feel like that has become clich\u00e9 now?\n\nThank you for holding me down with all those freestyles I\u2019ve been dropping. But yeah, it felt like it became a thing to do at the time. But they had no knowledge that was KRS-One\u2019s track or whose joint it was.\n\nThey were just grabbing these joints. They\u2019re probably just looking at the date on the back to see what year it was made, not knowing what the f*ck it is. That\u2019s why I said what I said.\n\nSalute to all the young motherf*ckers that what to grab those kind of tracks. At least know that\u2019s the old \u201cRock The Bells\u201d by LL Cool J when you do it, so you can reference and salute him in the song.\n\nIf you look at other genres like Rock & Roll and Country, they have real reverence for the people that came before them. You don\u2019t always get that in Hip Hop.\n\nFor one, we\u2019re the only culture/industry that puts on an age limit. They don\u2019t put that sh*t on Rock or Country. The reason why they put an age limit on [Hip Hop] is because they wanted that sh*t to be over.\n\nWhen Hip Hop first came, they thought it was going to be some overnight sh*t. Then they made it to where you have to be a young boy to be doing it. But you see U2 and those other motherf*ckers are still on tour.\n\nThen you got these young boys out here. People ain\u2019t schooling them on what\u2019s what and making them learn that sh*t. The labels are basically saying, \u201cGive me a quick hook and come up with a dance for it.\u201d That\u2019s it.\n\nYou\u2019re over a decade in the game. What drives you to keep making music?\n\nMe and my brothers listening and paying attention to what\u2019s going on out there, but not becoming these guys. Artists like J. Cole and Kendrick Lamar \u2013 that\u2019s inspiration right there. I keep my ear to the street. And after [the music is] done, the feedback. Hearing people say, \u201cDamn, they\u2019re still killing sh*t.\u201d Our shows are still sold out. The energy the fans give us makes me want to keep going, 100%.\n\nSpeaking of shows, The Lox went out with Ma$e, 112, Total, and others for the \u201cReunion Tour Experience 2.\u201d What was it like going back out together?\n\nIt was crazy seeing all the people. I just saw Faith at Kiss\u2019 album release party. We\u2019re actually leaving on tour with Puff. I think [it starts] the end of February for two months. It\u2019s going to be dope. He\u2019s putting it together. I think he\u2019s making the announcement soon \u2013 the \u201cNo Way Out Tour.\u201d I saw Puff at Kiss\u2019 party. It\u2019s all love. We\u2019re grown now. Everybody\u2019s in a better space in our lives right now.\n\nWas there a particular reason why you weren\u2019t on Puffy\u2019s MMM?\n\nWe talked about that. Puff said, \u201cI called you first.\u201d Every time he called, he said, \u201cLouch, I need you to come out here and get on this album.\u201d I said, \u201cDamn Puff, I leave for Canada for two months tomorrow morning.\u201d\n\nHe called me again. I said, \u201cDamn, I\u2019ll be in Australia, then New Zealand, then Hong Kong.\u201d I\u2019ve been touring like crazy. But he damn sure called me several times. Salute to Puff. I wish I could have been part of that joint.\n\nWhat else do you have planned for the rest of the year?\n\nI\u2019m dropping that Silverback Gorilla 2 on December 4. I leave for Europe in December. I come back to Philly. I really need to sit my ass down and start working on The Lox joint. I\u2019m always running around, touring, and coming back for that paper.\n\n[ALSO READ: The Lox Discuss How The Internet Has Led To More Fabrication In Hip Hop (VIDEO)]\n\nSheek Louch\u2019s Silverback Gorilla 2 is scheduled for release on December 4 via Tommy Boy Entertainment.
