Since that day that darkened the lives of so many, not only have residents been picking up the pieces, but the city as a whole has slowly been working toward recovering and rebuilding.\n\n\"I'm reminded quite often from those who are disconnected that come in and tell us how quickly we are moving,\" Louisville Mayor Will Hill said. \"It's encouraging and it really helps keep us going. The support has been there.\"\n\nAccording to Mayor Hill, Louisville has always been one to lend a helping hand to others, and when the tables turned, the support was still there - whether it be a friend, a family member, or a neighbor.\n\n\"On that day it became where neighbor helped neighbor,\" Mayor Hill said. \"First responders they couldn't have done a better job, it was everyone. Everyone reacted, those that were trained and those that weren't\"\n\nWhile a lot of rebuilding is still many months, if not years, away, the main question revolves around the hospital and where it goes from here.\n\n\"The hospital is a never-ending question,\" Mayor Hill said. \"Healthcare is alive and well in Louisville Mississippi. However, it is not in the facility in which we know that we need for long term. We're thankful for the temporary facility that we have, it's a federal asset with the leadership of our governor and MEMA helping us get that implemented quick. Within 19 days we had a hospital with an emergency room.\"\n\nHill says the temporary hospital will continue to operate, until future plans for the hospital damaged in the tornado come to light. For now, Hill believes it requires taking one day at a time and that the opportunity before them is great.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "The recovery of Louisville after a devastating tornado, is slowly but surely becoming a reality.", "language": "english", "author": "Aaron Morrison", "og": {"description": "The recovery of Louisville after a devastating tornado, is slowly but surely becoming a reality.", "title": "Louisville Mayor Talks Tornado Recovery and Rebuilding", "url": "http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/Louisville-Mayor-Talks-Tornado-Recovery-and-Rebuilding-278957091.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/C8B/EEE/C8BEEEA477984ACFAA90BE52778052D4", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/FC6/30D/FC630D288FE0460C97299F8BA1B148AB.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.wtok.com", "description": "The recovery of Louisville after a devastating tornado, is slowly but surely becoming a reality.", "title": "Louisville Mayor Talks Tornado Recovery and Rebuilding", "url": "http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/Louisville-Mayor-Talks-Tornado-Recovery-and-Rebuilding-278957091.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/Louisville+Recovery+September+2014.jpg", "creator": "@newscenter11", "site": "@newscenter11", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Louisville Mayor Talks Tornado Recovery and Rebuilding", "google-site-verification": "M1YwZ85zoJ2ZNboZjzjADGJ9L53qqzbNOi6FLrtDw9U", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Louisville Mayor Talks Tornado Recovery"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdaba0\"", "article_summary": "\"I'm reminded quite often from those who are disconnected that come in and tell us how quickly we are moving,\" Louisville Mayor Will Hill said.\n\"On that day it became where neighbor helped neighbor,\" Mayor Hill said.\nHill says the temporary hospital will continue to operate, until future plans for the hospital damaged in the tornado come to light.\n\"The hospital is a never-ending question,\" Mayor Hill said.\nIt's been nearly 6 months since the devastating EF-4 tornado struck the city of Louisville, leaving countless without their homes and claiming the lives of multiple people."}
