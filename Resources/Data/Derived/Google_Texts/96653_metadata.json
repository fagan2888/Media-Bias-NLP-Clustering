When you want to run for governor, it comes with the territory \u2014 and Northam, despite his mild manner and humble bearing, is getting used to the ceremonial shtick.\n\nWitness Monday, Nov. 16, when he was asked to stand in for Gov. Terry McAuliffe, Virginia\u2019s hyperbolic cheerleader-in-chief, at the Virginia Tourism Summit in Richmond. McAuliffe was on an economic development trip to India and the Middle East.\n\nNortham, 56, did not try to do an impression of the governor. Rather, in his trademark understated and dry delivery, he imagined out-of-state travelers enjoying a glass of Virginia wine, or pint of craft beer, or a spirit distilled in the commonwealth, followed by a selection of freshly shucked Virginia oysters.\n\nPut all those together, he said, \u201cand good things are going to happen.\u201d\n\nThe audience of tourism professionals erupted in laughter and later gave Northam a standing ovation when he left the stage.\n\nKeeping his day job as a physician\n\nThe election for governor is two years away, but both parties and their presumptive front-running candidates already are laying the groundwork for their campaigns.\n\nEd Gillespie, who came close to knocking off U.S. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., last year, has announced his intention to seek the GOP nomination and actively campaigned for Republican legislative candidates this year.\n\nAnd after Attorney General Mark Herring\u2019s decision to seek re-election rather than the Democratic nomination for governor, Northam has marshaled his resources into building a coalition of support, hiring staff and raising money for a general election run.\n\nDespite the shift into a more prominent and public political role, Northam \u2014 an Eastern Shore native, Virginia Military Institute graduate and U.S. Army veteran \u2014 still is firmly rooted in his day job as a physician.\n\nAs a pediatric neurologist, Northam spends his week seeing patients in Norfolk at the Children\u2019s Hospital of The King\u2019s Daughters. Providing care is what drew him to Warsaw last weekend for a 13-hour day seeing patients among the more than 600 people who turned up for free medical care that they otherwise could not afford.\n\nAnd it\u2019s what drives his support for finding a political solution that would allow the state to tap into taxpayer dollars Virginians already have paid to the federal government in order to expand Medicaid coverage to about 400,000 uninsured Virginians.\n\n\u201cThe idea of the RAM (Remote Area Medical) clinics is great ... but it\u2019s not the optimal way of taking care of someone with health care issues,\u201d Northam said in an interview.\n\nNortham, whose mother was a nurse and whose son is a new physician doing resident training in North Carolina, said he has spoken with other physicians in the legislature, but they do not want any part of the issue.\n\n\u201cA third of our hospitals are in the red; we are trying to build our economy,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir response was that 2016 is a presidential election \u2014 anything that has to do with the Affordable Care Act is going to be a non-starter.\n\n\u201cThey said they are going to support the free clinics in Virginia,\u201d Northam continued. \u201cThat\u2019s not a good option, in my opinion.\u201d\n\nHard to raise profilein faceless role\n\nNortham said economic development and job creation will be at the top of his list once the political spotlight turns his way after the November 2016 presidential elections. But not far behind will be the priorities that speak to his life experience \u2014 help for veterans and workforce development \u2014 and his job as a doctor.\n\nIf he were elected, Northam would be the first physician governor in modern Virginia history. (John Floyd, namesake of Floyd County, was a surgeon, a state delegate and a member of the U.S. House of Representatives before he served as Virginia\u2019s 25th governor from 1830 to 1834.)Northam\u2019s prescription for success will, at the very least, require him to hang out a very big shingle.\n\nA recent survey by the University of Mary Washington showed Gillespie leading in a hypothetical 2017 matchup with Northam, 40 percent to 33 percent. But more telling was the fact that 82 percent of voters surveyed said they did not know enough about Northam, a former state senator, to form an opinion.\n\nGillespie did not fare much better, with 77 percent saying they do not know enough about him, despite his close run for U.S. Senate against Warner last year.\n\n\u201cThe biggest challenge that you face is that the office of lieutenant governor is, for the most part, a very innocuous office,\u201d former Lt. Gov. Bill Bolling said.\n\nBolling served eight years in the post before deciding not to seek a third term and opting not to seek the GOP nomination for governor in the 2013 party convention.\n\nHe was among the more visible and consequential lieutenant governors in recent years, by taking on the additional role of chief jobs creation officer handed him by then-Gov. Bob McDonnell.\n\nStill, Bolling said, \u201cNobody knew who I was.\u201d\n\n\u201cRalph is a great guy,\u201d Bolling said. \u201cI like him a lot, but he\u2019s a very laid-back personality, and he\u2019s serving with a governor who sucks all the oxygen out of the room. Those are the challenges he\u2019s going to face.\n\n\u201cHis biggest plus is that he\u2019s a genuinely nice guy, a good and decent person. On the other hand, he has not been particularly visible and, therefore, he\u2019s going to have to spend a lot of time introducing himself to voters.\u201d\n\nIn making that introduction, Northam should be himself, said Larry Sabato, director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve generally found it to be unhelpful \u2014 and sometimes deadly \u2014 when a candidate decides to be someone he or she is not,\u201d he said. \u201cNortham is what he is, and he should run that way.\u201d\n\nSabato said a candidate can have a low-key approach and still emphasize issues that matter to the base. The key is how organized and energetic that base becomes in driving voter turnout in an off-year election, and how the electorate feels about the party in power \u2014 in Washington and in Richmond.\n\n\u201cRalph Northam is in many ways a generic Democratic candidate, and party label is going to have more impact on the results than the fact he\u2019s low-key, or a doctor, or from Tidewater, just to mention three other factors,\u201d Sabato said.\n\n\u201cI believe Ed Gillespie is pretty much the same \u2014 he is fundamentally a generic Republican and, in the end, his party label \u2014 and where Virginians are with respect to both parties \u2014 will matter more than anything else.\u201d\n\nNew suit of clothes, same low-key style\n\nNortham\u2019s approach as a senator managed to win bipartisan compromises on legislation to restrict smoking in Virginia restaurants and to set rules in schools protecting student-athletes from concussions.\n\nDespite his demeanor, Northam is not afraid to mix it up on issues that are important to him.\n\nAs a senator, he once angrily stormed out of a Senate Education and Health Committee meeting when the Republican-controlled panel was stifling debate on legislation affecting abortion clinics.\n\nAnd fresh off his visit to the RAM clinic, Northam issued a challenge, albeit civilly, to lawmakers opposed to tapping federal dollars for Medicaid expansion.\n\n\u201cI would tell them to come to the RAM clinic and bring their families and ask, \u2018Is this where I would choose to have my family go when they\u2019re sick, once a year?\u2019 \u201c he said.\n\n\u201cIf we would sit down at the table and put our political differences aside and say, \u2018How can we take care of these individuals?\u2019 ... We can do better in Virginia.\u201d\n\nSometime after the presidential election, Northam said he will take a sabbatical from his medical practice to concentrate full time on his campaign for governor.\n\nThat will mean more opportunities to raise his profile by doing what lieutenant governors do when they are not presiding over the Virginia Senate \u2014 more rubber-chicken dinner fundraisers, more photo ops with Smokey Bear.\n\nPicking up on a snarky observation about his sartorial style in a recent story, Northam went out and got a new suit, which he wore to the tourism summit.\n\n\u201cThe suit fits, but the shirt sleeves are too long,\u201d he said, making fun of his efforts. But few doubt Northam will change on the inside in his quest to pay a house call to the Executive Mansion.\n\nChief of Staff Clark Mercer recalled Northam\u2019s opportunity to address the crowd at Richmond International Raceway. Rather than deliver a political pitch, the racing fan dropped a line from the Will Farrell NASCAR movie comedy \u201cTalladega Nights.\u201d\n\n\u201cShake and bake!\u201d he said.\n\nJudging from the response, it seemed just what the doctor ordered.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "www.roanoke.com", "description": "RICHMOND \u2014 Being lieutenant governor means that every once in a while, you get to stand in for the governor and take on important jobs, such as commemorating the birthday of Smokey Bear.", "title": "The doctor is in: Ralph Northam speaks softly, carries big Democratic hopes for 2017", "url": "http://www.roanoke.com/news/politics/the-doctor-is-in-ralph-northam-speaks-softly-carries-big/article_16091ce3-b5a6-5217-93c7-cdca9fc56035.html", "image": {"width": 919, "identifier": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/roanoke.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/e/40/e406ccdf-619f-5176-b3b5-0948030ee036/5654939bc6ff9.image.jpg?resize=919%2C630", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@roanoketimes", "card": "summary"}, "description": "RICHMOND \u2014 Being lieutenant governor means that every once in a while, you get to stand in for the governor and take on important jobs, such as commemorating the birthday of Smokey Bear.", "fb": {"app_id": 251357365028982}, "keywords": "governor,northam,lt governor,politics,general_assembly,virginia", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/roanoketimes"}, "news_keywords": "governor,northam,lt governor,politics,general_assembly,virginia"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThey said they are going to support the free clinics in Virginia,\u201d Northam continued.\nThose are the challenges he\u2019s going to face.\nAs a pediatric neurologist, Northam spends his week seeing patients in Norfolk at the Children\u2019s Hospital of The King\u2019s Daughters.\nBut few doubt Northam will change on the inside in his quest to pay a house call to the Executive Mansion.\nRalph Northam, who occupies the part-time, second-fiddle state government post, doesn\u2019t mind."}
