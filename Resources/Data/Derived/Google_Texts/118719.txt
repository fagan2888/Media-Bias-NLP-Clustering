RICHMOND, Va. (AP) â€” Virginia is marking the ninth anniversary of the shooting at Virginia Tech.

The Richmond Times Dispatch reports (http://bit.ly/23FipoY ) that the victims of the 2007 shooting were honored Saturday during a small gathering in Richmond. Capitol Police Officer Mathias Varga pulled the rope of the Capitol Square Bell Tower 32 times for each of the victims.

Greg Gwaltney's son Matt was among those killed when a student went on the shooting rampage at the Blacksburg school. Gwaltney says "it doesn't get any easier." He says Christmas is extremely difficult and when the birds sing in the Spring, "it's like just after it happened."

Virginia Tech alumni in Richmond also organized a blood drive Friday to commemorate the victims by helping others.
