Notably, despite the lack of such a law, nobody can point to any Indiana businesses that were discriminating against gays.\n\nThe father in the clip understandably raised hackles by stating his opinion that people \"choose\" homosexuality, but the key sentence comes at the very end of the report: \"The O'Connell family tells me that if a gay couple, or a couple belonging to another religion, stepped into their restaurant to eat, they would never deny them service. They only say they would just not cater their wedding.\" Is this the sort of \"hatred\" over which these people (who did not seek the spotlight, by the way) ought to be abused and boycotted? Is this the sort of country we want to live in?\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Intolerance..05/26/2016 18:45:46PM EST.", "author": "Guy Benson", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Intolerance.", "title": "Guy Benson - MSNBC 'Debate' on Indiana Law: 'Cut His Mic Off!'", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/guybenson/2015/04/01/cut-his-mic-n1979459", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2013/73/5f0250c5-6c2e-4924-8692-b8159b795d04.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Intolerance.", "title": "Guy Benson - MSNBC 'Debate' on Indiana Law: 'Cut His Mic Off!'", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/guybenson/2015/04/01/cut-his-mic-n1979459", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2013/73/5f0250c5-6c2e-4924-8692-b8159b795d04.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "MSNBC 'Debate' on Indiana Law: 'Cut His Mic Off!' , Guy Benson, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "Indiana does not have a public accommodation law that protects against anti-gay discrimination, meaning there\u2019s no state law in Indiana preventing anti-gay discrimination in businesses even before the state RFRA was enacted.\nNotably, despite the lack of such a law, nobody can point to any Indiana businesses that were discriminating against gays.\nIs this the sort of \"hatred\" over which these people (who did not seek the spotlight, by the way) ought to be abused and boycotted?\nIs this the sort of country we want to live in?\nThey only say they would just not cater their wedding.\""}
