Mark Pryor\u2019s re-election campaign released an ad Wednesday that touts a part of Obamacare \u2014 a rarity among Democrats hoping to stave off attacks derived from the law\u2019s negative headlines and poor polling numbers.\n\nThe 30-second spot, which doesn\u2019t mention the 2010 law by name, features Mr. Pryor\u2019s father, former Sen. David Pryor, sitting at the table and discussing the younger Pryor\u2019s battle with cancer.\n\n\u201cMark\u2019s insurance company didn\u2019t want to pay for the treatment that ultimately saved his life,\u201d David Pryor says.\n\nMr. Pryor, who is hoping to stave off Republican Rep. Tom Cotton this fall, then highlights consumer protections in the Affordable Care Act of 2010.\n\n\u201cNo one should be fighting an insurance company while you\u2019re fighting for your life,\u201d Mr. Pryor said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I helped passed a law that prevents insurance companies from canceling your policy if you get sick, or deny coverage for preexisting conditions.\u201d\n\nRepublicans are hoping to parlay Obamacare\u2019s poor ratings into a net gain of six Senate seats and control of the chamber after November\u2019s mid-term contests.\n\nAs a result, vulnerable Democrats in red-leaning states have been reluctant to tout President Obama\u2019s signature health reforms, even though Arkansas and Kentucky have been praised as southern innovators that implemented the law relatively well.\n\nInstead, they\u2019ve focused on their opponents\u2019 approaches to Medicare or the so-called \u201cwar on women.\u201d\n\nThe Pryor ad comes two weeks after Gallup reported that the two states are leading the nation in cutting down their ranks of uninsured residents.\n\nThe Cotton campaign said it admires Mr. Pryor\u2019s courage in fighting cancer, but \u201cwe didn\u2019t need Obamacare to change insurance regulations.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe all agree that nobody should be denied coverage due to a preexisting condition,\u201d campaign spokesman David Ray said. \u201cObamacare raises taxes on the middle class, has caused millions of Americans to lose insurance plans they were promised they could keep, has doubled or even tripled premiums on families who can\u2019t afford it, has caused lost wages and hours at work, and is preventing many small businesses from growing and hiring more people.\u201d\n\nHe said the nation needs to start over with reform \u201cthat makes health care more affordable and keeps health care decisions between patients and doctors.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sen.
