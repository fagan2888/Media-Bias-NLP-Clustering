MSNBC’s Ed Schultz is a bit of a firebrand. Or, as the Media Research Center’s Barbara Boland put it, he is “absolutely unhinged.”

The MRC compiled Ed’s finest moments into a hilarious video chronicling his adventures in denying that Obamacare has any problems, calling Laura Ingraham a “right-wing slut,” and general expletive-laden ranting.

“The best?” Boland said. “He admits he has no evidence for what he says, but just take his word for it.”
