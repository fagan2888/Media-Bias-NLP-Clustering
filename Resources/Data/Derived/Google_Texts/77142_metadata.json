This CBS News investigation into the Hines, Illinois facility adds a new twist \u2014 performance bonuses. Germaine Clarno alleges that this facility had multiple, fraudulent wait lists intended to make the facility\u2019s performance look better, and also intended to qualify its leaders for extra cash from the VA:\n\nGermaine Clarno is a VA social worker and employee representative in Chicago. She alleges there are multiple secret waiting lists of veterans kept at the Hines VA Medical Center. Asked which divisions of the hospital kept the secret waiting lists, Clarno says, \u201cEmployees are coming to me from all over the hospital, from outpatient, inpatient, surgery, radiology.\u201d Clarno says veterans were put on secret waiting lists when they called for appointments, but they wouldn\u2019t formally get an appointment booked in the computer until one came up within the VA\u2019s goal of 14 days. The purpose of the lists, she says, was to hide how often veterans were not being seen on time. Clarno says the purpose of the lists was \u201cto make numbers look better for their own recognition and for bonuses.\u201d The VA grants bonuses to executives and doctors, partly based on short wait times. Whistleblowers \u2014 including Dr. Sam Foote, who revealed the scandal in Phoenix, where up to 40 veterans may have died \u2014 believe bonuses give an incentive to conceal delays in care.\n\nJust how long has the VA known about the problem of wait-list fraud? Well over a year, NBC reported yesterday:\n\nThe VA is auditing all of its medical facilities after whistleblowers claimed employees were manipulating patient schedules to hide long wait times which may have contributed to patient deaths. \u201cI think every American should be outraged about how our veterans are being treated American Legion National Commander, Daniel Dellinger. An internal memo from March 2013 obtained by NBC shows top VA officials learned of the problem well before the current allegations, and had been quietly trying to fix it. \u2026 \u201cThe question to the Secretary is, did he know? And if not \u2013 if he did not know what was in a GAO report or Inspector General\u2019s report, why not?\u201d asked Senator Jerry Moran, (R) Kansas.\n\nThey have known about the problem for 15 months \u2014 and only now are getting around to doing audits? Sounds like a typical VA wait time, eh?\n\nShinseki is scheduled to appear tomorrow at a Congressional hearing that looks more and more like a distinctly unpleasant experience for all involved. Whether or not he knew, Shinseki\u2019s team apparently did, and Shinseki is responsible for their work. Shinseki needs to go, as part of a larger housecleaning at the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "VA knew in March 2013?", "title": "New wait-list fraud alleged in Illinois VA", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2014/05/14/new-wait-list-fraud-alleged-in-illinois-va/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "keywords": "Department of Veteran Affairs, Eric Shinseki, fraud, scandal, waiting list,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-05-14T13:21:35+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-05-14T13:16:47+00:00"}, "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9e70\"", "article_summary": "She alleges there are multiple secret waiting lists of veterans kept at the Hines VA Medical Center.\nNew wait-list fraud alleged in Illinois VAposted at 9:21 am on May 14, 2014 by Ed MorrisseyThat would put the list to seven facilities now where whistleblowers and/or media probes have discovered allegations and evidence of wait-list fraud at VA facilities.\nSounds like a typical VA wait time, eh?\nJust how long has the VA known about the problem of wait-list fraud?\nThe purpose of the lists, she says, was to hide how often veterans were not being seen on time."}
