The Medical Society of the State of New York has filed a federal lawsuit asking the Eastern District court to intervene to prevent United Healthcare from dropping nearly 2,000 of the society’s doctors from its Medicare plans on Jan. 1, court documents show.

In a complaint filed Dec. 23, the Medical Society alleges the insurer terminated doctors’ contracts as Medicare providers in order to offset “reduced federal payments under the Affordable Care Act.”

The Society has 22,000 member physicians in New York State.

The termination of provider contracts would confuse Medicare beneficiaries, “who must now either find new physicians ... or incur significant additional out of pocket costs to continue treatment with an ‘out of network provider,” the complaint argues.

A spokesperson for United Healthcare could not immediately be reached and the Medical Society’s attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The complaint alleges “thousands of medicare beneficiaries” currently enrolling in the program “may soon find that their trusted medical provider is no longer a participating provider.”

Two other medical associations, based in Connecticut’s Hartford and Fairfield Counties, also filed similar complaints against United, the filing shows.

The complaint is not the first time the MSSNY has expressed general concern over the Affordable Care Act. In a December 2nd letter to New York state health exchange director Donna Frescatore, medical society president Sam Unterricht said the society worried the federal health law was being laid out in a way that allows “health insurers to essentially run roughshod over the patients and the physicians who will be delivering their medical care.”
