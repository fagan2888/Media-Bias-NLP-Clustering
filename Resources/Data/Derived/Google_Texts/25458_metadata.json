Baggage fees. Cancellation fees.\n\nWhat used to feel like airport incidentals now seem like a routine part of air travel. And if any of these fees have you feeling fed up, well, you\u2019re not alone.\n\nThe Forbidding Airlines from Imposing Ridiculous Fees Act \u2014 yes, that\u2019s really what it\u2019s called \u2014 aims to keep those in check.\n\n\u201cAirlines fees are as high as the planes passengers are traveling on, and it\u2019s time to stop their rapid ascent.\u201d\n\nThe bill, introduced this week by Sen. Edward Markey (D-Mass.) and Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), calls out the fees airlines can charge for checked baggage, ticket changes and cancellations.\n\n\u201cAirlines fees are as high as the planes passengers are traveling on, and it\u2019s time to stop their rapid ascent,\u201d Markey said. \u201cAirlines should not be allowed to overcharge captive passengers just because they need to change their flight or have to check a couple of bags.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis measure will ground the soaring, gouging fees that contribute to airlines\u2019 record profits and passengers\u2019 rising pain,\u201d Blumenthal said. According to government statistics, airlines including United, Delta, American and Southwest netted more than $5 billion in the first three quarters of last year, in extra fees on checked bags, flight changes and cancellations. \u201cThat\u2019s a large amount of money that goes directly to the bottom line,\u201dBloomberg travel reporter Justin Bachman said in an interview. \u201cSo fees have become a very critical aspect of airline profitability these days.\u201d Congress hasn\u2019t been involved in airline pricing since it deregulated the industry in 1978 under the Airline Deregulation Act, which intended to remove government control over fares, routes and market entry from commercial aviation.\n\nIn response to the new legislation, airline industry advocates belittled the bill as an effort to re-regulate air travel by disposing of the fees that they say give travelers more flexibility.\n\n\u201cCustomers have choices today,\u201d Melanie Hinton, the communications director for Airlines for America, told PBS NewsHour in a statement. \u201cThey can purchase nonrefundable fares that are highly affordable.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese fare structures help to reduce passenger \u2018no-shows\u2019 and the need for airlines to overbook,\u201d Hinton said. \u201cIf they would like the flexibility to change their ticket at the last minute, they can do so as well.\u201d\n\nBachman said chances of the bill passing in its current form appear to be slim, but the fact it is being discussed at the congressional level does signal that lawmakers are listening to \u201cthe growing chorus from the public who\u2019s sitting at the back of the airplane that things are getting a little tight and a little bit uncomfortable.\u201d\n\nStill, \u201cit\u2019s a long shot,\u201d he said.\n\nWhat do you think?
