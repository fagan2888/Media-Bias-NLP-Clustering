Bob Casey pushed for the passage of legislation to delay flood insurance hikes during a visit to Exeter on Friday morning.\n\nMore than 30,000 Pennsylvanians could be impacted by the rate increases, including more than 1,500 residents in Luzerne and Lackawanna counties, Casey said.\n\n\"For a lot of people in this county, in this region and across our state, flooding has been part of their lives,\" he said during a press conference in the Exeter Borough Building. \"Many people have lived through this not just once, but over and over again.\"\n\nCasey is pushing for the Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act which, he said, has support in both houses of Congress and would protect Pennsylvanians.\n\nIn the meantime, some are already feeling the first impacts of the flood insurance hikes.\n\nAccording to numbers Casey provided, of the 34,477 subsidized insurance policies in the state, 9,345 were immediately impacted by rate increases, about 27 percent. Another 21,423 could see increases if their property is sold or if there is a lapse in their policies.\n\nOf the 1,159 subsidized policies in Luzerne County, 254 (or 22 percent) have already been impacted by rate increases and 668 will be affected if their property is sold or there is a lapse in their policies. Lackawannna County has 759 subsidized policies, 146 of which were already impacted.\n\nMore policies will be impacted under the full implementation of the act, which Casey said he is trying to amend.\n\nCasey said the Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act would delay rate increases for all homes and businesses which are currently \"grandfathered\" as well as all properties that purchased a new policy after July 6, 2012, before they were legally required to purchase insurance, and all properties sold after July 6, 2012.\n\n\"A delay of a rate increase is a measure of help that they wouldn't have had otherwise,\" he said.\n\nCasey said the legislation also would seek assurances of the Federal Emergency Management Agency's ability to accurately determine flood risk, establish a flood insurance advocate within the agency and allow the agency to use the National Flood Insurance Fund to reimburse policy holders who successfully appeal a map determination.\n\nExeter Mayor Cassandra Coleman-Corcoran and West Pittston Mayor Tony Denisco expressed support for the legislation.\n\nSome residents pay $4,000 for flood insurance, Denisco said. Recalling the devastation from the September 2011 flooding, he said 853 homes in West Pittston were affected.\n\n\"Some of those people are still struggling to get back on their feet. There are quite a few homes that are not occupied in West Pittston,\" Denisco said. \"For some of the people in West Pittston, if this increase goes in, it's going to cripple them.\"\n\ndallabaugh@citizensvoice.com, 570-821-2115", "article_metadata": {"author": "By Denise Allabaugh\n (Staff Writer)", "title": "Casey: Delay flood insurance hikes", "robots": "ACAP allow-index", "DC.creator": "By Denise Allabaugh\n (Staff Writer)", "tout": {"article": {"id": "1.1618721"}}, "keywords": "Local", "DC.subject": "Local", "DC.title": "Casey: Delay flood insurance hikes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc6fb\"", "article_summary": "EXETER - U.S. Sen.
