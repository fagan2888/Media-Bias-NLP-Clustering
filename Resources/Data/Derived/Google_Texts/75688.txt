First lady Michelle Obama has sported bangs with style, and now she’s adopting a new trend: stickers.

The first lady donned the silly look Monday with help from a little girl at a pre-Easter arts and crafts event for military families in Maryland. The blondie toddler sitting in her mother’s lap started handing stickers to Obama.

Obama placed the first one on her foreheard, and the little girl started placing the rest on the first lady’s face.

“I love it,” she said, while family members chuckled at the sight.

The Obama family dogs, Sunny and Bo, were along for the adventure to meet and greet the children, and the first lady passed out special “Sunny and Bo” cookies to the kids.

Obama offered invitations to next week’s White House Easter Egg Roll to all the families, too. The event will be wellness-focused again this year, with a ”Hop into Healthy, Swing into Shape” theme. This year’s featured guest will be Cam Anthony, a 12-year-old singer who’s become a YouTube sensation

Obama has been a regular visistor to Fisher House over the years, an organization that provides homes for military families while their loved ones receive treatment at Washington-area Walter Reed Medical Center or another military hospital.



“This is the best part of my day,” she said during the event. “With so many great families, you guys, but more importantly I get to shine a light on you all, our military families.”

The first lady has supported Fisher House with visits in the past, and the Obama family donated more than $8,000 to the Fisher House Foundation charity in 2013, according tax return documents released last week, the most generous of all the donations they made to more than two dozen charities in 2013.
