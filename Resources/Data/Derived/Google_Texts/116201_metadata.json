The department asked six insurers that requested increases of more than 25 percent to phase in the increases over several years, according to a news release from the department.\n\n\"We are working to guarantee that Pennsylvanians can continue to shop for their best coverage options in a competitive insurance marketplace while still paying reasonable prices,\" Gov. Tom Wolf said in the release.\n\nHighmark Inc., the state's largest insurer, had requested increases of 23 to 39 percent, saying the costs of treatment for new policyholders far exceeded what the company collected in premiums, a result of sicker-than-expected enrollees.\n\nOnly two plans \u2014 HM Health Insurance Co. and Keystone Health Plan West \u2014 will increase premiums by more than 25 percent next year, Pennsylvania Insurance Department spokesman Ronald Ruman said.\n\nOf the 19 companies selling individual health insurance plans on the state's Affordable Care Act marketplace next year, seven are increasing premiums by more than 10 percent, according to the release. All 23 companies that sell plans to businesses with fewer than 50 employees are increasing premiums by less than 10 percent, according to the release.\n\nFor 2015, the average monthly premium is $222 for Pennsylvania's lowest-cost \"silver\" plan, one of the most popular plans sold on the marketplace. Plans are classified as bronze, silver, gold and platinum according to the level of benefits they offer; bronze plans are the cheapest and platinum the most expensive.\n\nOpen enrollment runs from Nov. 1 to Jan. 31.
