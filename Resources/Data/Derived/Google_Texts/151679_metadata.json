Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany both spoke with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. Mr. Cameron\u2019s office relayed that Mr. Putin \u201csaid that Russia did want to find a diplomatic solution to the crisis\u201d and \u201cagreed that it is in all our interests to have a stable Ukraine.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nBy the British account, Mr. Putin said he would discuss proposals for a contact group, which the West envisages involving direct talks between Moscow and Kiev.\n\nThe German government said Ms. Merkel made it clear that any Crimean referendum was illegal and that it would not be recognized internationally. On Thursday, the chancellor said that if a contact group was not formed soon and no progress was made in negotiations with Russia, the European Union could impose sanctions on Russia, including travel restrictions and the freezing of assets.\n\nAccording to the Kremlin\u2019s account of the call, however, Mr. Putin \u201cunderlined in particular that the steps taken by Crimea\u2019s legitimate authorities are based on international law and aimed at guaranteeing the legitimate interests of the peninsula\u2019s population\u201d and that Kiev was not acting \u201cto limit the rampant behavior of ultranationalists and radical forces in the capital and in many regions.\u201d\n\nVideo\n\nThe Kremlin statement continued: \u201cDespite the differences in the assessments of what is happening,\u201d the three leaders \u201cexpressed a common interest in de-escalation of the tensions and normalization of the situation as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe new Ukrainian government and its supporters, the United States and the European Union, reject the legitimacy of the Crimea referendum, scheduled for March 16, and deny that any ethnic Russians or Russian speakers have been threatened or harmed in Ukraine.\n\nVladimir Konstantinov, the speaker of the Crimean parliament, had said on Friday that Ukrainian troops remaining there should \u201cquietly and peacefully\u201d leave the territory unless they were willing to renounce their loyalty to Kiev and serve the region\u2019s new administration.\n\nPhoto\n\nLate Sunday, Mr. Konstantinov told reporters that the Ukrainian military installations \u201cin large part have come under control \u2014 they are blocked, and their weapons are under joint control.\u201d That was only partially true, since Russian forces were still demanding that Ukrainian forces disarm and surrender.\n\nHe said the Ukrainian forces\u2019 final status will be determined after the referendum. \u201cIf they want to serve the people of Crimea, they need to inform us of that,\u201d he said. \u201cThose who do not want to, we will secure their safe exit from the territory of Crimea, and they can leave the peninsula.\u201d\n\nPavel Dorokhin, deputy chair of the State Duma\u2019s committee on industry, said while on a visit to Simferopol that Russia has set aside 40 billion rubles, or about $1.1 billion, to rebuild Crimea\u2019s industrial infrastructure. He said that after the referendum, Crimea may take on one of three statuses within Russia \u2014 that of a region, a territory or an autonomous republic.\n\nIn the United States, President Obama\u2019s deputy national security adviser, Antony J. Blinken, rejected the notion that Crimea was now effectively Russian. \u201cIt\u2019s not a done deal,\u201d he said on the CNN program \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201cI think the door is clearly open to resolving this diplomatically.\u201d\n\nHe noted that Mr. Obama and European leaders continued to engage with Mr. Putin.\n\n\u201cRussia\u2019s paying a price for this,\u201d he said. \u201cThe question now is whether they will take the off ramp that the president and our partners around Europe have proposed. There is a way out of this that can take into account Russia\u2019s interests and concerns, but restores Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty. That\u2019s what we\u2019re working on.\u201d\n\nRobert M. Gates, a former defense secretary, was less optimistic, telling \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d: \u201cI do not believe that Crimea will slip out of Russia\u2019s hands.\u201d He said of Mr. Putin: \u201cI don\u2019t think that he will stop in Ukraine until there is a government in Ukraine, in Kiev, that is essentially pro-Russian.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAlthough President Obama has made it clear that the United States does not want to escalate the Crimean crisis, the Pentagon has increased training operations in Poland and sent fighter jets to patrol the skies over Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, three former Soviet republics with sizable populations of ethnic Russians.\n\nIn Kiev, the rally on Sunday was also addressed by an emotional Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the Russian oil oligarch who spent years in prison after he challenged Mr. Putin. Mr. Khodorkovsky was released in December.\n\n\u201cI want you to know that there is another Russia,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are people who despite the arrests, despite the long years they have spent in prison, go to antiwar demonstrations in Moscow\u201d and support \u201cfriendship between the Russian and Ukrainian people.\u201d He said he saw no more \u201cfascists or neo-Nazis\u201d in Kiev than \u201con the streets of Moscow and St. Petersburg.\u201d\n\nMr. Khodorkovsky added, \u201cI believe that Russia and Ukraine have a united, common European future.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140309105643, "twitter": {"description": "In Sevastopol, a pro-Ukraine rally of hundreds was attacked by pro-Russia supporters, who had their own rally there, while Ukraine celebrated the birth of its greatest poet in the Crimean capital.", "title": "Clashes in Ukraine as Rallies Take a Turn", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/10/world/europe/developments-in-Ukraine.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002758541"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/10/world/10ukraine1/10ukraine1-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/10/world/europe/developments-in-Ukraine.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002758541", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/10/world/europe/developments-in-Ukraine.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "world/europe", "hdl_p": "Clashes in Ukraine as Rallies Take a Turn", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/world/europe/index.jsonp", "video": {"playerId": 2640832222001, "publisherReadToken": "cE97ArV7TzqBzkmeRVVhJ8O6GWME2iG_bRvjBTlNb4o.", "publisherId": 1749339200, "noShareToolsPlayerId": 3692909326001}, "DISPLAYDATE": "March 9, 2014", "edt": "NewYork", "keywords": "Ukraine,Russia,Crimea (Ukraine),Konstantinov  Vladimir,Putin  Vladimir V,Demonstrations  Protests  and Riots", "news_keywords": "Ukraine,Russia", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Steven Erlanger and Ellen Barry", "SCG": "europe", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Putin, Vladimir V", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By STEVEN ERLANGER and ELLEN BARRY", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "In Sevastopol, a pro-Ukraine rally of hundreds was attacked by pro-Russia supporters, who had their own rally there, while Ukraine celebrated the birth of its greatest poet in the Crimean capital.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/10/world/10ukraine1/10ukraine1-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "In Sevastopol, a pro-Ukraine rally of hundreds was attacked by pro-Russia supporters, who had their own rally there, while Ukraine celebrated the birth of its greatest poet in the Crimean capital.", "CG": "world", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "March 9, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/topics/reference/timestopics/people/b/ellen_barry/index.html", "section": "Europe", "modified": "2014-03-10", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/world/europe/index.jsonp", "tag": "Demonstrations, Protests, and Riots", "published": "2014-03-09", "section-taxonomy-id": "9A43D8FC-F4CF-44D9-9B34-138D30468F8F"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "geo": "Crimea (Ukraine)", "slug": "10ukraine", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20140310135812, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/10/world/europe/developments-in-Ukraine.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/10/world/10ukraine1/10ukraine1-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "In Sevastopol, a pro-Ukraine rally of hundreds was attacked by pro-Russia supporters, who had their own rally there, while Ukraine celebrated the birth of its greatest poet in the Crimean capital.", "title": "Clashes in Ukraine as Rallies Take a Turn"}, "pdate": 20140309, "des": "Demonstrations, Protests, and Riots", "articleid": 100000002758541, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Clashes in Ukraine as Rallies Take a Turn", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/10/world/10ukraine1/10ukraine1-thumbLarge.jpg", "PST": "News"}, "article_summary": "Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany both spoke with President Vladimir V.
