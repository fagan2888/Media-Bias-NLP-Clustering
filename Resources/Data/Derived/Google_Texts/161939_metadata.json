The success of the Organization for Security and Europe monitoring mission would lessen the chances that heavy fighting will resume in conflict that has already left more than 6,000 dead in a year.\n\nEvidence is emerging, however, that the warring sides are leading monitors on a time-wasting game of hide-and-seek.\n\nDistrust between foes remains intense and anxiety lingers that a new flare-up could be just around the corner.\n\nOn Friday, an Associated Press journalist saw two tanks and two 120 mm caliber guns being taken toward the front in rebel territory, near the separatist-held city of Donetsk. Two days earlier, Ukrainian troops were seen transporting a tank and a large-caliber gun in the town of Avdiivka, which also lies right on the front line.\n\nNone of the weapons should have been there.\n\nUnder a peace deal laboriously negotiated between the leaders of Ukraine, Russia, Germany and France, anything with a caliber of 100 mm or above should be pulled back 50-to-140 kilometers (30-to-90 miles) from the front.\n\nThe weapons withdrawal began the last week of February and both sides claim to have completed the process. But the OSCE says to make sure the pullbacks happened, it must know how many weapons each side has and where they are being stored.\n\n\u201cSome information has been provided from both sides, but we still need substantial information,\u201d said Michael Bociurkiw, the OSCE mission spokesman.\n\nOn Friday, a group of inspectors in rebel territory traveled from Donetsk to Novoamvrosiivske, a village near the Russian border where AP journalists on Feb. 26 followed four trucks carrying Grad launchers to a cement factory.\n\nIn that same cement factory, monitors scrutinized dozens of tanks, rocket launchers and howitzers, eyeing serial plates, taking photos and writing down notes. Where serial numbers were scratched away, a photo was taken of that missing information.\n\nIn separatist areas, OSCE teams have to ask in advance for permission to visit sites they wish to see and they travel under the supervision of rebel fighters.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Confidence in Ukraine\u2019s cease-fire hurt by arms violations", "title": "Confidence in Ukraine\u2019s cease-fire hurt by arms violations", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Confidence in Ukraine\u2019s cease-fire hurt by arms violations", "title": "Confidence in Ukraine\u2019s cease-fire hurt by arms violations", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/03/21/confidence_in_ukraines_cease_fire_hurt_by_arms_violations/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/ukraine.jpeg3-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Confidence in Ukraine\u2019s cease-fire hurt by arms violations", "title": "Confidence in Ukraine\u2019s cease-fire hurt by arms violations", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/ukraine.jpeg3-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "MSTYSLAV CHERNOV and Peter Leonard", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "In separatist areas, OSCE teams have to ask in advance for permission to visit sites they wish to see and they travel under the supervision of rebel fighters.\nTheir task is to verify whether government troops and Russian-backed rebel forces are removing heavy weapons from the front line in accordance with a February cease-fire deal.\nOn Friday, an Associated Press journalist saw two tanks and two 120 mm caliber guns being taken toward the front in rebel territory, near the separatist-held city of Donetsk.\nIn that same cement factory, monitors scrutinized dozens of tanks, rocket launchers and howitzers, eyeing serial plates, taking photos and writing down notes.\n\u201cSome information has been provided from both sides, but we still need substantial information,\u201d said Michael Bociurkiw, the OSCE mission spokesman."}
