This weekend is the company\u2019s first appearance at a Topeka event.\n\nWendell Turner said the business is a fun venture he began from scratch after he created a steel palm tree sculpture as an anniversary gift to his wife, Helen, who grew up in Florida.\n\nNow he and his sons fill orders as far away as Hawaii and Dubai, an emirate in the United Arab Emirates federation. Turner said warm-climate people transplanted to colder locales are drawn to his work.\n\n\u201cThey just get sick and tired of looking at the cold weather,\u201d he said.\n\nTurner and his wife did their first show 12 years ago and now his sons visit events in larger cities as the company grows. The average height and weight of the trees they construct are about 300 pounds and between 7 and 14 feet tall. They build them as high as 25 feet. Each one averages about 40 to 50 hours to make.\n\nLights and speakers also are affixed into some of them. Sculpted monkeys were spotted among the leaves.\n\nThe palm tree is a symbol of success and relaxation, Turner said, and a wonderful way to accent patios, pools and parking lots or landscaping in general.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something to pretty them up,\u201d he said.\n\nAnother few thousand people were anticipated for the Garden Show\u2019s final day, which runs from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Sunday with tickets at $6 apiece.\n\nJamie Hancock, a horticulture agent in Shawnee County and an organizer of the Garden Show, said the turnout has been great. She said people particularly enjoy the landscape booths and \u201ca taste of spring\u201d they experience while snow remains outside.\n\nThere even was a show of national pride with a large display of the Olympic Rings comprised of plants and flowers.\n\nAddysen Welker, 6, with a koala bear and Powercat logo painted on her cheeks, was creating spin art. She was helped by spin art guru David Cain as her grandmother, Mary Welker, stood nearby.\n\nThe elder Welker said \u201cwe\u2019re remodeling everything\u201d inside and outside, and that she had collected ideas perusing the show.\n\n\u201cEverything is so nice out here,\u201d she said.\n\nCain, who with his wife takes up a post at numerous Expocentre events with their face painting and spin art booth, leaned forward in his chair as he emphasized how \u201cvery busy\u201d the two had been Saturday.\n\nThe couple enjoy providing youngsters with fun activities to break up the monotony of walking around booths and displays with adults.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just something the kids love to do,\u201d Cain said.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "News, Local, Corey Jones", "og": {"site_name": "CJOnline.com", "description": "With piles of plowed snow lingering in the Kansas Expocentre's parking lot, thousands of people were greeted inside the building Saturday by a welcome springtime flair and an impressive tropical display at the entrance of the annual Garden Show.", "title": "Garden Show provides spring, tropical flair amid snow", "url": "http://cjonline.com/news/2014-02-15/garden-show-provides-spring-tropical-flair-amid-snow", "image": "http://cjonline.com/sites/default/files/13090710.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "With piles of plowed snow lingering in the Kansas Expocentre\u2019s parking lot, thousands of people were greeted inside the building Saturday by a welcome springtime flair and an impressive tropical display at the entrance of the annual Garden Show.The event sold about 3,000 tickets Friday, and organizers on Saturday expected 5,000-plus would be purchased that day."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddc77\"", "article_summary": "Greatly accentuating the omnipresent feeling of warmer months ahead was Designer Palms Inc., a family-owned small business based in Andover that constructs steel palm trees.\nAddysen Welker, 6, with a koala bear and Powercat logo painted on her cheeks, was creating spin art.\nShe was helped by spin art guru David Cain as her grandmother, Mary Welker, stood nearby.\nShe said people particularly enjoy the landscape booths and \u201ca taste of spring\u201d they experience while snow remains outside.\nThe palm tree is a symbol of success and relaxation, Turner said, and a wonderful way to accent patios, pools and parking lots or landscaping in general."}
