If a parent wants their child to opt out of a vaccination, they must file a religious or medical objection, the only exemptions districts are allowed to consider.\n\nCouple all of that with the fact that the state gives districts the option to move up health-check deadlines if they choose \u2014 the state's due date is Oct. 15, later than Champaign (Sept. 1) and Urbana and Danville (first day of class) \u2014 and those students with limited access to health care are often the ones held out of school when their medical checklist isn't complete.\n\nTo address this, school districts across the area have teamed up with medical facilities to provide a little extra help for parents.\n\nFor the past four years, Unit 4 has worked in partnership with the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District and the Carle health system to offer free physicals and easy access to immunizations throughout the summer. Typically, the health department holds two to four free clinic days during the summer and early fall for Champaign students, according to Unit 4 Head Nurse Margee Poole.\n\nDistrict nurses also work with families to help students get enrolled in \"Kid Care,\" child health care through the Affordable Care Act.\n\nCommunities pitch in\n\nApril Jones, head nurse at Rantoul Township High, works with Rantoul City schools to help bring health-care providers to town that offer free clinics. Last year, that included free dental services offered at the high school.\n\nWhen such arrangements can't be worked out, high school Principal Todd Wilson said, Jones works individually with families to help set them up with services in Champaign-Urbana.\n\n\"Sometimes, the resources are available and we are able to provide opportunities locally. Unfortunately, there are other times when the resources are not available in our part of the county,\" Wilson said. \"It is during those times that we try to steer all our families in the right direction. The physical and immunization requirement is a state mandate that the parents are responsible for. We assist the families in the capacity that we are able to, dependent on the resources available to us.\"\n\nThe situation is similar in districts like Danville and Westville, where schools elicit community support to make sure kids get the services they need before the start of the year.\n\n\"We reach out to churches, social agencies, local physicians and other community-related resources to advocate on our families' behalf. We have many community-based groups that work to support all of our families,\" said Brenda Yoho, Danville's director of educational support programs.\n\nIn Westville, the district often relies on the services at the Vermilion County Health Department, where families without health care access can learn how to apply for insurance or Medicaid, Judith Giacoma Elementary Principal Pam Dalenberg said. Screenings for vision and hearing are conducted in-house by Westville school nurses. Plus, the local Lions Club pitches in to help families in need.\n\nUrbana: On-the-spot help\n\nUnlike other area districts, Urbana has revolutionized its role in student health.\n\nFunded via an Illinois Department of Public Health grant, the Urbana School Health Center is attached to the high school, operates year-round and is available to anyone under the age of 19.\n\n\"We don't deny any patient,\" Program Coordinator Teresa Turner said.\n\nEven if a student can't afford the $20 co-pay, they still get help, she said.\n\nThe center has been around since 2004, offering students on-the-spot treatment for acute medical issues as well as immunizations, mental health counseling and free physicals.\n\n\"We take people with insurance, medical cards, no insurance, international students with international insurance, you name it, we take it,\" Turner said.\n\nThe center has a nurse practitioner on staff, as well as a main primary medical director and a doctor who comes in two or three times a month. Turner said international, new and low-income students take advantage of the services most often. Care is available through appointments and walk-ins.\n\n\"The unique part is we're able to keep the kids in school,\" she said. \"They can come over for an appointment and go right back. If a student doesn't have their physical or immunization complete by the due date, they can come right in and we can send them right back to school. There's no wait.\"\n\nBack to school\n\nThe first day of school will be here before you know it. A glance at what's happening in the meantime:\n\nTUESDAY\n\nSuperintendent DON OWEN briefs Urbana school board members on the process for choosing someone to replace ELAINE GEHRMANN, who resigned after five-plus years representing west central Urbana.

Westview Elementary will serve breakfast from 7:45-8:15 a.m. and lunch from 11:15-11:45 a.m. Urbana's program ended in mid-July.\n\nFRIDAY\n\nIn a 4 p.m. ceremony, Champaign's Booker T.
