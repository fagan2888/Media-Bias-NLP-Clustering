Donald Trump’s kids say they know better than to poke fun at their dad’s oft-talked-about hairstyle.

“I like not to,” Donald Trump Jr., 37, tells Barbara Walters, “because you never know what happens genetically.”

The veteran journalist sat down with the four eldest of Trump’s five children for a joint interview airing Friday on ABC’s “20/20.” The network says Trump's youngest son, 9-year-old Barron, didn't attend the interview because he was in school.

“It’s funny,” says 34-year-old Ivanka Trump, “because it’s the only hair we’ve ever known. But people seem fascinated.”

The GOP presidential front-runner’s dramatic hairdo has long attracted both headlines and critical observation.

“My dad says, ‘I’m really happy you got your mom’s hair, not my hair,'” 22-year-old Tiffany Trump, whose mother is Trump’s ex-wife, Marla Maples, tells Walters.

Eric Trump, 31, praises his real estate mogul dad in the preview clip, saying his humor "is really one of his best qualities. "People don’t see that — it doesn't come across on the news when he's talking about serious issues.”

Trump’s son adds of his dad, “But he’s incredibly funny, an incredibly practical person.”
