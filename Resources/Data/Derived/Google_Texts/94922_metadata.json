Among them was the elimination or limitation of a procedural motion that would make it tougher for members to unseat the speaker \u2013 a demand the most conservative House members called a \u201cnon-starter.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut Ryan caved, agreeing to delay consideration of the change until some point in the future.\n\n\n\nIt was a major victory for members of the House Freedom Caucus, who will continue to push for decentralization of power and more amendments on bills while hoping to prevent changes on the motion to vacate the chair.\n\n\n\nShould they prevail, Ryan\u2019s honeymoon period \u2013 if he gets one at all \u2013 will be short indeed.\n\nClinton Triumphs in Benghazi Testimony\n\nClinton Triumphs in Benghazi Testimony Jacquelyn Martin/AP What Happened:\n\n\n\nOver the course of 11 hours Thursday, House Republicans faced off against Hillary Clinton over her role regarding the 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya, that left four Americans dead.\n\n\n\nMembers of the chamber's special committee pressed Clinton on her involvement as secretary of state in the security preparations for the Benghazi compound. In doing so, they attempted to paint her as neglectful or uncaring in the face of repeated requests from Ambassador Chris Stevens for help in the months before the attacks, and as more concerned with her public image and claiming credit for successes in Libya than in monitoring a deteriorating situation.\n\n\n\nClinton deftly parried much of what the committee\u2019s Republicans threw at her, defending her decisions leading up to the Sept. 11 violence and in the days and weeks following. She repeatedly batted away insinuations she should have handled Stevens\u2019 requests for more security herself, insisting that allowing security experts to field such requests helps ensure that those best equipped to respond to them can do so.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, questions over her use of a private email server \u2013 the committee's only major discovery thus far \u2013 took up relatively little time.\n\n\n\nWhy It Matters:\n\n\n\nEven in conservative circles, the hearing was roundly viewed as a loss for Republicans, who have struggled to fend off accusations that the committee's purpose is to damage Clinton's presidential prospects.\n\n\n\nDemocrats have long been calling the panel's activities blatantly partisan, but their narrative took off last month when House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California linked the committee\u2019s work with Clinton\u2019s sinking poll numbers. And on Thursday, in both the optics and substance of the hearing, Republicans compared poorly to Clinton, appearing to lecture her.\n\n\n\nDuring one particularly tense moment, Clinton wasn't even the focus of GOP ire. Chairman Trey Gowdy of South Carolina, who has fruitlessly tried to rescue the committee\u2019s reputation, got into a shouting match with the panel's top Democrat, Elijah Cummings of Maryland, regarding the release of testimony provided to the committee by Clinton confidant Sidney Blumenthal.\n\n\n\nAfter the hearing, Gowdy seemed to acknowledge the marathon session had accomplished little.\n\n\n\n\"I don't know that she testified that much differently today than she has the previous time she testified,\" he told reporters.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Clinton, who simply needed to avoid a major stumble, did just that. And moments in which she grew emotional while discussing Stevens and the three other Benghazi victims \u2013 Sean Smith, Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty \u2013 could soften her perception among voters who have viewed her unfavorably.\n\nObama Vetoes Defense Authorization Bill\n\nObama Vetoes Defense Authorization Bill Susan Walsh/AP What Happened:\n\n\n\nPresident Barack Obama on Thursday followed through on a threat to veto legislation authorizing military spending, the latest salvo in the battles over government funding that have plagued Capitol Hill all year.\n\n\n\nThe annual National Defense Authorization Act, which passed Congress with bipartisan support, fell victim to the debate centered on the sequester spending caps initially mandated by the Budget Control Act of 2011.\n\n\n\nDemocrats and Obama have insisted upon raising the caps for both defense and domestic spending. Republicans, however, have only been interested in raising defense funding and sought to get around the cap on it by calling for an additional $38 billion in the NDAA for an emergency wartime fund.\n\n\n\nCritics have equated using the Overseas Contingency Operations account in such a way with turning it into a slush fund for the military. And Democrats have argued that employing the method without raising domestic discretionary spending leaves the country more vulnerable, since agencies on the domestic ledger \u2013 including the Department of Homeland Security, the Coast Guard and the Transportation Security Administration \u2013 would still be hamstrung by the spending caps.\n\n\n\nWhy It Matters:\n\n\n\nIt wasn\u2019t clear until this week whether Obama would follow through on the veto threat, which the White House made earlier this year.\n\n\n\n\"It\u2019s a bad bill [in] that it shortchanges the men and women who serve in the armed forces because it employs an irresponsible spending gimmick to fund them that's unreliable,\" White House deputy press secretary Eric Schultz said Thursday.\n\n\n\nNow, the president's move ratchets the pressure up on budget negotiations, which were already stumbling. As a price for keeping the government open, Republicans have been demanding major cuts to entitlement programs, which Democrats say are off the table.\n\n\n\nTwo years ago, a budget-related government shutdown was avoided through the work of Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., and Rep. Paul Ryan, then the chairman of the House Budget Committee.\n\n\n\nWith Ryan soon taking up the speaker\u2019s gavel, all eyes will be on him to see if he can help lead his fractious caucus to a similar compromise before the Dec. 11 deadline.\n\nGOP Own Worst Enemy on Obamacare\n\nGOP Own Worst Enemy on Obamacare Carlos Osorio/AP What Happened:\n\n\n\nThe House on Friday passed a bill that would gut portions of the Affordable Care Act. And unlike other times they\u2019ve passed measures to unravel Obamacare, this one had been expected to make it through the Senate.\n\n\n\nUsing a tool called reconciliation \u2013 a process that exempts a budget-related bill from a Democratic filibuster in the upper chamber \u2013 the legislation would eliminate the health care law's individual and employer mandates, the so-called Cadillac tax and the medical device tax. It also includes a provision to block federal funding to Planned Parenthood.\n\n\n\nHowever, despite needing just 51 of the 54 members of the Republican majority to pass, the bill is no longer a sure thing in the Senate. In narrowing the scope of the reconciliation bill in hopes of getting it through the upper chamber, House Republicans instead exposed it to conservative ire, with Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Marco Rubio of Florida \u2013 both candidates for the GOP presidential nomination \u2013 among those who don't think the bill goes far enough.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf this bill cannot be amended so that it fully repeals Obamacare pursuant to Senate rules, we cannot support this bill,\u201d Cruz, Rubio and Sen. Mike Lee of Utah said in a joint statement Thursday. If they persuade one more Republican to join them, the measure will fail.\n\n\n\nWhy It Matters:\n\n\n\nFailing to pass their own reconciliation bill would be a major embarrassment for Republicans who have touted the process as a chance to land a punch on the president, who would be forced to veto the measure.\n\n\n\nConservatives have made repealing the Affordable Care Act one of their top priorities since its passage, and doing so has been a centerpiece of many campaigns \u2013 both for Congress in the past several elections and in the current presidential race. The stance drove much of the party's success in 2014, when Republicans swept into a two-chamber majority in Congress, and members are expected to lean on the law's continuing unpopularity among the GOP base this year.\n\n\n\nBut now, they risk undermining their own message. If even this symbolic version of an anti-Obamacare bill fails to clear the lowest bar \u2013 simple majorities in both chambers \u2013 Republicans' reputation for disarray within their own ranks will only grow.\n\nConservative Debt Ceiling Proposal Stumbles", "article_metadata": {"zone": "slideshows", "keyword": "Politics [News]", "title": "5 Things to Know About Congress This Week: 10/23/2015", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "U.S. News breaks down what happened on Capitol Hill.", "title": "5 Things to Know About Congress This Week", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/slideshows/5-things-to-know-about-congress-this-week-10-23-2015", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/ca/7bd90d36201c6498638e901f61830b/media:79e051d8546a467da58e6bd9aacbbb51APTOPIXHouseRepublicans.JPEG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@USNews", "description": "U.S. News breaks down what happened on Capitol Hill.", "card": "summary", "title": "5 Things to Know About Congress This Week: 10/23/2015"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "news", "date_published": "Oct. 23, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "slideshow", "keywords": "Gabrielle Levy,Pulse,picks,politics,Congress,Clinton, Hillary,Ryan, Paul,Affordable Care Act,deficit and national debt,Politics [News]", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "U.S. News breaks down what happened on Capitol Hill."}, "article_summary": "In narrowing the scope of the reconciliation bill in hopes of getting it through the upper chamber, House Republicans instead exposed it to conservative ire, with Sens.\n\"I don't know that she testified that much differently today than she has the previous time she testified,\" he told reporters.\nMembers of the chamber's special committee pressed Clinton on her involvement as secretary of state in the security preparations for the Benghazi compound.\nAnd on Thursday, in both the optics and substance of the hearing, Republicans compared poorly to Clinton, appearing to lecture her.\nWhy It Matters:It wasn\u2019t clear until this week whether Obama would follow through on the veto threat, which the White House made earlier this year."}
