Varlamov will participate in the morning skate at the Pepsi Center along with backups Reto Berra and Calvin Pickard.\n\n\u201cWe just wanted to give it an extra day (of rest) and see how it goes (Thursday) morning, and we\u2019ll make a decision,\u201d Roy said of Varlamov after Wednesday\u2019s high-tempo practice.\n\nPickard started against the Kings, but was replaced by Berra late in the first period. Pickard stopped five of eight shots, and Berra 20-of-22. For the season, Pickard has a .932 save percentage in 895 minutes. Berra is at .890 over 456.\n\nBoth goalies are eager to start Thursday if Varlamov can\u2019t.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure what\u2019s going to happen, but I\u2019ll be ready to go in there when they call me on,\u201d said Pickard, 22. \u201cI\u2019ve had a chance to string together a few games at a few different times. I\u2019m used to it. I\u2019m comfortable playing at this level. (Tuesday), obviously, was not what I wanted, but some nights you don\u2019t get the bounces. But looking ahead, I feel like I\u2019m here to stay. I feel comfortable playing at this level, for sure.\u201d\n\nPickard is in the final year of his three-year, entry-level contract and is a pending restricted free agent. Berra, 28, is under contract for the next two seasons, with cap hits of $1.45 million and $1.5 million.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m probably getting another opportunity, and I want to be ready,\u201d Berra said.\n\nDuring Varlamov\u2019s three previous injury stints with groin issues, Berra has mostly been passed over for Pickard, the No. 1 goalie for the Lake Erie Monsters of the American Hockey League. Berra was admittedly frustrated with the unusual depth chart that allowed Pickard to play so many games at Lake Erie under his AHL contract. Berra gets paid his NHL contract wherever he plays.\n\n\u201cAt the beginning, it was tough to understand, but you have to learn to deal with it, especially for a young guy new in the NHL,\u201d the Swiss goalie said. \u201cI\u2019ve found a way, and I came back and just worked hard. Hockey is not always up. You have to go on these downs.\u201d\n\nRoy said Varlamov\u2019s groin injury is not as serious as it was earlier in the season and that the team is \u201cabsolutely not\u201d thinking about shutting him down for the season and watching Berra and Pickard audition for next season\u2019s backup job.\n\nThe Avs are seven points out of the playoffs with only 15 games remaining.\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t want to go into detail \u2014 and it\u2019s not like I want to keep it for us \u2014 but I\u2019m not a doctor,\u201d Roy said of Varlamov\u2019s injury. \u201cI can\u2019t give you the exact term and exactly how it is, but, no, it\u2019s not as severe as the first times.\u201d\n\nMike Chambers: mchambers@denverpost.com or twitter.com/mikechambers\n\nNEW JERSEY AT COLORADO\n\n\n\n7 p.m. Thursday, ALT; 950 AM\n\nSpotlight on Mike Cammalleri: The 5-foot-9 Devils forward is an undersized goal-scoring machine, which is why New Jersey signed him in free agency last summer at $25 million over five seasons. He has a team-high 24 goals, two shy of what he produced last season for Calgary, and also leads the team with 122 shots. Cammalleri, 32, is a Canadian who played three years at the University of Michigan.\n\nNOTEBOOK\n\nDevils: They lost 6-2 at Minnesota on Tuesday to begin a three-game road trip that ends Saturday at Arizona. \u2026 New Jersey is 10th in power-play percentage (19.6), but 21st in penalty killing (80.6). \u2026 The Devils are 29th in shots per game (24.3). \u2026 Goalie Cory Schneider is a workhorse in net, having started 57 of the Devils\u2019 67 games. Schneider leads the NHL in shots against (1,673) and saves (1,549) and is fourth in save percentage (.926).\n\nAvalanche: Rookie forward Joey Hishon skated on his own before practice Wednesday, but is doubtful with neck and elbow injuries. The Avs will again have no extra bodies and will use their 20 available players. Center John Mitchell was banished to the fourth line Tuesday. \u201cI\u2019ve been minus-8 my last seven games. I can\u2019t find a plus. Every time I\u2019m on the ice, it seems like the puck\u2019s in the back of our net,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s the right move right now. I have to earn (the coach\u2019s) trust back. This is an important time of year, and I want to be a strong player at this time, not someone that he doesn\u2019t want playing.\u201d\n\nMike Chambers, The Denver Post", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Avalanche still aims for playoff spot, wants Semyon Varlamov in net", "title": "Avalanche still aims for playoff spot, wants Semyon Varlamov in net", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/03/11/avalanche-still-aims-for-playoff-spot-wants-semyon-varlamov-in-net/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150311__varlyp1.jpg", "height": 447}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150311__varlyp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-11T16:42:34+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T20:32:51+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "For the season, Pickard has a .932 save percentage in 895 minutes.\nVarlamov will participate in the morning skate at the Pepsi Center along with backups Reto Berra and Calvin Pickard.\nEvery time I\u2019m on the ice, it seems like the puck\u2019s in the back of our net,\u201d he said.\nDuring Varlamov\u2019s three previous injury stints with groin issues, Berra has mostly been passed over for Pickard, the No.\n\u201cI just don\u2019t want to go into detail \u2014 and it\u2019s not like I want to keep it for us \u2014 but I\u2019m not a doctor,\u201d Roy said of Varlamov\u2019s injury."}
