One way to answer that is via a line of ancient poetry.\n\nThe fox knows many things, the Greek poet Archilochus once wrote, but the hedgehog knows one big thing. In other words, is it better to be a cunning player of many games, or a highly focused one-trick pony?\n\nMcDonald\u2019s, the fox in this scenario, has been firing multiple shots in all directions to stay on top in the fast food wars. In the last year alone it launched chicken wings, fish nuggets, bacon habanero ranch burgers and a line of wraps, among many other things. Wendy\u2019s on the other hand, went full hedgehog \u2014 but instead of curling up into a spiky protective ball, it doubled down on its core burger lineup and introduced a very successful twist: the pretzel bun.\n\nThe resulting share price action over the last year speaks for itself (McDonald\u2019s in yellow, the S&P 500 in red, Wendy\u2019s in blue):\n\nvia Google Finance\n\nMcDonald\u2019s has made plenty of admissions that its much more elaborate menu isn\u2019t working as planned: It dropped the premium-priced Angus Third Pounder burger, acknowledged its line of salads aren\u2019t selling like literal or figurative hotcakes, and said its customer service has suffered because it introduced too many new menu items too quickly.\n\nIn discussing results yesterday, McDonald\u2019s chairman Don Thompson said the company needs to \u201cre-establish the trust of customers\u201d if it wants to overcome flat sales and profits. \u201cThat means basic execution at a restaurant level, marketing engagement at a much stronger level and also to make sure that our menu is relevant.\u201d\n\nAs the WSJ\u2019s Julie Jargon reported, that process will include adding more employees at busy times and changing the layout of kitchens to give employees more space to prepare food. But will it be able to make a hit new product that takes off in the market like the pretzel burgers at Wendy\u2019s, or Taco Bell\u2019s Doritos Locos Tacos? As the WSJ reported last year, it\u2019s been a long time since the company struck gold with a new menu item:\n\nThe fast-food company hasn\u2019t had a new product become a bona fide blockbuster\u2014a unique new product that stays on the menu and meaningfully affects business\u2014since the 2003 introduction of the pancake sandwiches it calls McGriddles, according to analysts.\n\nIts next hit might not even be food. The company has big hopes to take more share of the drink market, especially coffee, where it says it is underperforming. Here\u2019s CEO Donald Thompson on an analyst call last November:\n\nThe way that we look at this opportunity is based upon what we view as a McDonald\u2019s fair share based upon our overall share within the marketplace, which basically tells you that we are less than that fair share now and feel like we have some room to go to catch up relative to our opportunities within beverages. Having said that, it\u2019s also a growing category. So as beverages continue to grow, we also want to participate in the growth. [The competition is] any place that you can buy a beverage. So when you stop off \u2014 anyone that stops off to get a cup of coffee anywhere, that\u2019s a competitor. That\u2019s an opportunity potentially for us. Now we\u2019re not chasing every single competitor, we\u2019re looking at what the larger buckets of opportunities are. So what\u2019s coffee on the go, what \u2014 where are we strongest in that coffee arena? We\u2019re pretty strong in drip coffee, but we can be stronger. There\u2019s more players entering this space, but we can be stronger in terms of our coffee execution.\n\nWhatever it\u2019s next big hit will be, McDonald\u2019s better hurry, because Wendy\u2019s is about to introduce the ciabatta bun.\n\nSee also:\n\nMcDonald\u2019s Says Its Restaurants Got Too Complicated \u2013 WSJ\n\nAt McDonald\u2019s, Salads Just Don\u2019t Sell \u2013 WSJ", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "One way to explain the differing fortunes of two historic names in the American burger business over the last year is via a line of ancient Greek poetry.", "title": "McDonald\u2019s and Wendy\u2019s: A Modern-Day Fox vs Hedgehog", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2014/01/24/mcdonalds-and-wendys/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/MI-CA850_EARNIN_P_20140120202203.jpg"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Business", "article.headline": "McDonald\u2019s and Wendy\u2019s: A Modern-Day Fox vs Hedgehog", "description": "One way to explain the differing fortunes of two historic names in the American burger business over the last year is via a line of ancient Greek poetry.", "article_section": "Business", "author": "Tom Gara", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Corporate Intelligence Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Corporate Intelligence", "article.summary": "One way to explain the differing fortunes of two historic names in the American burger business over the last year is via a line of ancient Greek poetry.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-01-24T22:53:05-05:00", "dj.asn": "10-210", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2014/01/24/mcdonalds-and-wendys/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-234B-3565", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Business", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "One way to explain the differing fortunes of two historic names in the American burger business over the last year is via a line of ancient Greek poetry.", "title": "McDonald\u2019s and Wendy\u2019s: A Modern-Day Fox vs Hedgehog", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2014/01/24/mcdonalds-and-wendys/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/MI-CA850_EARNIN_P_20140120202203.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Corporate Intelligence", "article.id": "BL-234B-3565", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-01-24T23:26:53-05:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0d24\"", "article_summary": "BloombergWhat has been the big difference between McDonald's and Wendy's, two historic names in the American burger business, over the last year?\nWhatever it\u2019s next big hit will be, McDonald\u2019s better hurry, because Wendy\u2019s is about to introduce the ciabatta bun.\nThe fox knows many things, the Greek poet Archilochus once wrote, but the hedgehog knows one big thing.\nMcDonald\u2019s, the fox in this scenario, has been firing multiple shots in all directions to stay on top in the fast food wars.\nThe company has big hopes to take more share of the drink market, especially coffee, where it says it is underperforming."}
