We manufacture much more today than we did in the 1950s, and we grow a lot more cotton, too \u2014 and both enterprises require fewer workers today than they did back then. When one worker can produce what ten workers used to produce, or a hundred, wages go up, which is why you can make $100,000 a year harvesting cotton today.... Nor is it the case, as Theroux writes, that \u201cglobalization is the search for a new plantation, and cheaper labor.\u201d There is in fact relatively little foreign direct investment in low-wage countries. The top destination for globe-trotting capital is . . . the United States, which takes in almost twice as much as the second-place finisher, the not remarkably impoverished United Kingdom. Other than China (No. 5), you won\u2019t find a relatively low-wage country anywhere near the top of the list. Instead, you find: Germany, Belgium, France, Canada, Switzerland, Spain, Ireland, Singapore, Brazil, Australia, the Netherlands. . . . And even China isn\u2019t really a low-income country anymore; it\u2019s been classified as upper-middle-income by the World Bank for years, and investment in China has grown as wages have grown. They still aren\u2019t making BMWs in Rwanda. Some race to the bottom.\n\nAnd Theroux thinks he can blame heartless international capitalism on the fact that some cities in the deep South are quite poor in relation to the rest of the U.S?\n\nThe South was an extraordinarily poor and backwards place until the day before yesterday. In the 1950s, about half of the households in the South didn\u2019t have indoor plumbing. The economic transformation of the South in the past 50 years has been astounding, a success story for the ages.\n\nNor has the system of international trade that allows businesses to move from the deep South failed to help the rest of the world:\n\nJust as the gentlemen of the Times were putting the headline on Theroux\u2019s daft little tantrum, the World Bank published its estimate that this year \u2014 this year, not at some point in the happy-happy future \u2014 the number of people living in extreme poverty on this planet will dip below 10 percent for the first time in the history of the human species. Change will always inconvenience somebody, it is true, and those great jobs sewing underwear in Southern factories for $100 a week no longer exist. Famine no longer exists and several million formerly poor people get to eat, and the terrible tradeoff is what? A fellow who used to work in a sneaker factory has to go hustle real estate or become a restaurant proprietor? Meanwhile, the poor people of Mississippi, still our poorest state, on average have to get by on a mere 118 percent of the median income in France. Cheap moralizing of the sort that Theroux engages in, or the cheap sentimentalism that informs the Trump-Buchanan-Sanders view of globalization \u2014 \u201cglobalization\u201d being another way of saying \u201chuman cooperation\u201d \u2014 helps exactly no one...\n\nIt's a shame that rising to the defense of free(ish) trade, even if it results in a situation that can make the sensitive sad if looked at utterly out of historical or world context, is still a necessary tonic in public policy.
