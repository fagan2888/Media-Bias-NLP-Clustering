Police are praising a "alert citizen" for helping officers arrest a kidnapping suspect.

The citizen called 911 after witnessing a girl being forced into a silver SUV near the Broadmoor Hotel just after 12:30 Saturday morning. Police say the citizen followed the SUV eastbound on Lake Avenue, staying at a safe distance and giving location updates to the 911 operator.

Thanks to the citizen, officers were able to stop the SUV at the intersection of Cheyenne Meadows Road and Highway 115.

Police say the victim and suspect were dating, and had been involved in some sort of domestic altercation prior to the incident the witness had seen. The victim was badly injured and required hospitalization. Police say the suspect will be facing felony charges.

The suspect has been identified as 19-year-old Nicholas Hughes.
