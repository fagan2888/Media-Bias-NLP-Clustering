The court also ordered the tech company to disable the function that delays time between successive attempts to access an iPhone.\n\nThe government also is demanding that Apple create new software that would undermine encryption.\n\nIf Apple complies, Comey said, the FBI could break into the iPhone 5c used by Syed Rizwan Farook, one of the terrorists who killed 14 people in San Bernardino, Calif., last year.\n\nComey said it would currently take the FBI up to 10 years to unlock the phone using brute force\u2014where tech experts test every possible password combination\u2014even if the auto erase function were disabled. The requested software alterations would reduce that time to 26 minutes.\n\nApple is challenging the court order, contending the FBI\u2019s demand that it create a \u201cbackdoor\u201d reversing encryption would expose protected data to hackers, including terrorists.\n\nBut Comey rejected that claim. Instead, he said, the government is asking Apple to \u201ctake the vicious guard dog away\u201d from a door that already exists on the iPhone 5c and to allow federal agents to \u201cpick the lock.\u201d\n\nThe FBI director warned of the consequences of allowing technology to become warrant-proof, noting that until the creation of encryption, there was no space in the U.S. that could not be accessed through a court-ordered search warrant.\n\n\u201cThe problem we face here is, all of our lives are on these devices, which is why it\u2019s so important that they remain private,\u201d Comey said. \u201cThat also means that all of criminals\u2019, and pedophiles\u2019, and terrorists\u2019 lives are on these devices, and if they\u2019re warrant-proof, if even a judge can\u2019t order access to a device, that is a big problem.\u201d\n\nApple filed a motion Thursday opposing the FBI\u2019s demand, charging that it is an unconstitutional breach of power. Tech companies, including Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and Twitter, are uniting to back Apple.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re being asked to do is to write a brand new computer code, write a new operating system,\u201d Sewell testified. \u201cThe law with respect to the applicability of computer code to speech is well established. This is a compelled speech by the government.\u201d\n\nHe further said the order would violate the Fifth Amendment\u2019s protection against conscription, because the government effectively would be forcing labor.\n\nThe hearing by the House Judiciary Committee arrived a day after a federal magistrate in New York dealt a blow to the FBI, ruling in a separate case that the government could not compel Apple to mine data from an iPhone used in a drug crime.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u201cWe see ourselves as being in an arms race\u2014in an arms race with criminals, cyber terrorists, hackers,\u201d says Apple's attorney.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\u201cWe see ourselves as being in an arms race\u2014in an arms race with criminals, cyber terrorists, hackers,\u201d says Apple's attorney.", "title": "Apple iPhone Decryption Could Set Precedent, FBI Admits", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/120301_FBIApple_Johnson.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-03-02T22:08:42+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1ONxZ4v"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\u201cWe see ourselves as being in an arms race\u2014in an arms race with criminals, cyber terrorists, hackers,\u201d says Apple's attorney.", "title": "Apple iPhone Decryption Could Set Precedent, FBI Admits", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/120301_FBIApple_Johnson.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Security", "tag": "cyber", "published_time": "2016-03-02T11:41:58+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-02T22:08:42+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "James Comey, FBI, Apple, encryption, Bruce Sewell, House Judiciary Committee, San Bernardino, cybersecurity, Justice Department"}, "article_summary": "FBI Director James Comey conceded Tuesday that the government\u2019s demand that Apple decrypt an iPhone used by a San Bernardino terrorist could set a precedent for succeeding cases.\nApple has rooted its resistance to the FBI in the notion that any of its iPhone users could be susceptible to privacy vulnerabilities if the government succeeds in forcing the company to create decryption software.\nIf Apple complies, Comey said, the FBI could break into the iPhone 5c used by Syed Rizwan Farook, one of the terrorists who killed 14 people in San Bernardino, Calif., last year.\nThe court also ordered the tech company to disable the function that delays time between successive attempts to access an iPhone.\nA federal court ordered Apple two weeks ago to deactivate an iPhone feature that automatically wipes data after an individual enters an incorrect password 10 times."}
