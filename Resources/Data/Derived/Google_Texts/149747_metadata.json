Seventy percent make the promise of health benefits in retirement to current active employees, and 57% plan to offer these benefits to employees hired after 2014.\n\nNearly nine out of 10 employers (89%) say retirement medical benefit security is somewhat to extremely important to their retirees. While they want to maintain the promise to employees, a number of forces are influencing employers to change their approach, including the accounting liability on their balance sheets (92%), the ongoing administration and expense (90%), Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) fiduciary and disclosure obligations (84%) and the absence of an efficient funding vehicle (54%).\n\nMost sponsors (93%) of medical plans for Medicare-eligible retirees expect to continue sponsorship or provide a subsidy for at least the next three years, and they continue that promise to active employees (90%) and even new hires (86%). However, 60% say their 2015 plan costs already exceed the cap they have on their costs.\n\nConcerned about costs, 34% are altering plan design, with 30% changing employer subsidies and formulas for cost sharing with employees. They are also actively considering alternatives: 78% are using or considering using the services of a Medicare exchange to assist retirees in electing individual coverage, and 41% are funding or considering funding retiree medical benefits through a voluntary employee beneficiary association (VEBA) or a 401(h) to reduce their risk profile.\n\nTop factors influencing employers\u2019 medical strategy and design in the next two to three years include coverage cost and medical inflation, the 2018 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) excise tax, availability of exchanges and administrative burden.\n\nTowers Watson surveyed 144 companies representing 2.1 million employees and nearly a million retirees in September 2014 for its Survey on Retiree Health Care Strategies.
