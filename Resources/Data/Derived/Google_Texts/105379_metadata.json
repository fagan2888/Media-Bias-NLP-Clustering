Malcolm is a former assistant U.S. attorney, a former deputy assistant attorney general in the Department of Justice\u2019s Criminal Division, and the current chairman of the Criminal Law Practice Group of the Federalist Society.\n\nFirst, a little background. The Affordable Care Act threw members and staff out of the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, and basically says they can only get health benefits through one of the law\u2019s new exchanges. Under pressure from Congress and the president himself, the federal Office of Personnel Management (which administers benefits for federal workers, including Congress) decided the House and Senate would participate in the District of Columbia\u2019s \u201cSmall Business Health Options Program,\u201d or \u201cSHOP\u201d Exchange, rather than the exchanges that exist for individuals. The reason is that federal law would not allow members and staff to keep receiving a taxpayer contribution of up to $12,000 toward their premiums if they enrolled in individual-market exchanges. Yet putting Congress in a small-business exchange isn\u2019t exactly legal, either. Both federal and D.C. law expressly prohibited any employer with more than 50 employees from participating D.C.\u2019s SHOP Exchange. The House and Senate each employ thousands upon thousands of people.\n\nOkay, now here\u2019s an excerpt from our new op-ed:\n\n\u201cDocuments obtained under the Freedom of Information Act show that unnamed officials who administer benefits for Congress made clearly false statements when they originally applied to have the House and Senate participate in D.C.\u2019s \u201cSHOP\u201d Exchange for 2014. Notably, they claimed the 435-member House had only 45 members and 45 staffers, while the 100-member Senate had only 45 employees total\u2026\n\n\u201cMaking a materially false or fraudulent statement as part of a claim against the U.S. Treasury is a separate federal crime, as is wire fraud. Ordinary citizens who violate these laws face fines of up to three times the amount drawn from the Treasury and/or up to 20 years in prison. They might also face prosecution for health care fraud (10 years), violating the Sarbanes-Oxley ban on falsifying documents (20 years), conspiracy to commit such offenses (5 years), and other crimes under federal and D.C. law.\n\n\u201cNewly unearthed documents suggest these officials knew they were violating the law.\u201d\n\nThose new documents include admissions by officials in Congress and D.C.\u2019s small-business exchange that the House and Senate are in fact not small businesses.\n\nJust as I am once again highlighting how the Obama administration is trying to save this ill-conceived and unworkable law by spending money it has no authority to spend, University of Michigan law professor Nicholas Bagley is once again defending the administration. Bagley agrees with a large part of my account when he writes:\n\n\u201cThe exchange website in Washington, DC includes a field for the number of employees. If you enter a figure above 50, the website won\u2019t accept the application. That\u2019s because large employers are ineligible to use the SHOP exchange.\u201d\n\nActually, the web site doesn\u2019t include that field any more, which is part of why Bagley is wrong. But I\u2019ll save that for another day.\n\nBagley\u2019s argument is that since OPM determined Congress may participate in D.C.\u2019s SHOP Exchange, those false statements were not \u201cmaterial to the approval of their applications,\u201d and therefore do not satisfy the elements of one of the federal crimes we mentioned.\n\nIf OPM\u2019s interpretation of the statute is lawful, Bagley may be right. But if OPM\u2019s decision is not lawful, the these false statements are what Malcolm and I allege: a material part of a fraudulent scheme \u201cto facilitate illegal, taxpayer-funded gifts to members of Congress.\u201d So a lot is riding on whether OPM\u2019s determination is lawful.\n\nBagley claims OPM\u2019s determination is lawful because the ACA exempts Congress from the rules requiring SHOP Exchanges to reject employers with more than 50 employees. If he has evidence that such an exemption exists, he should cite it. He doesn\u2019t cite it, however, because it doesn\u2019t exist. If it did, OPM no doubt would have cited it when the agency announced this curious decision in the first place. Instead, the agency just pretended that such an exemption existed, and pretended the statutory requirement it was vitiating, and D.C.\u2019s corresponding statutory requirement, do not. All Bagley offers in support of this claim is a link to a three-year-old post of his that addresses a different issue (about which Bagley is also wrong; but again, we\u2019ll save that another day). Curiouser and curiouser.\n\nIn sum, if Bagley can substantiate his claim that \u201cthe ACA singles out [Congress] as a special case\u201d where the rules requiring SHOP Exchanges to reject large employers do not apply, he should do so. If not, what does that tell us?\n\nMichael F.
