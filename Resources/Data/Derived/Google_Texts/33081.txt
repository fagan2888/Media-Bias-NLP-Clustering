Here’s a window into the state of Catholic universities today: A priest who directed campus ministries at New Jersey’s Seton Hall University said he was fired for — get this — a Facebook post supporting LGBT rights.

NJ.com has the story:

Rev. Warren Hall posted on Twitter Friday afternoon that he was “fired from SHU for posting a pic on FB supporting LGBT ‘NO H8.’ I’m sorry it was met with this response. I’ll miss my work here.”

“Seton Hall University does not comment on personnel matters,” spokeswoman Laurie Pine said in a statement. “The Archbishop of Newark appoints the Director of Campus Ministry, who serves at his discretion.”
