Live Action observes that Planned Parenthood received over $540 million in taxpayer funds in its last reported fiscal year. Additionally, the abortion industry giant gets tax funding to be a \u201cnavigator\u201d for ObamaCare, and at least a portion of the additional $75 million per year ObamaCare appropriates for \u201csex counseling\u201d through the Personal Responsibility Education Program (PREP) will also go to Planned Parenthood.\n\nAccording to PREP\u2019s website, the program is \u201cthe first federal funding stream for programs that teach about abstinence and contraception for the prevention of pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections (STIs).\u201d\n\nThe program\u2019s website states, \u201cPREP offers a brand new opportunity \u2013 federal funding for science-based sex education that includes information on abstinence and contraception. Until this year, the only dedicated federal funding for sex education was for abstinence-only-until-marriage programs.\u201d\n\nRegarding abstinence sex ed programs, PREP states, \u201cThese programs censor vital information from young people, who have the right to complete, accurate information that will allow them to make informed decisions about their sexual health.\u201d\n\nAccording to Live Action, Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains and Planned Parenthood Columbia Willamette, two regional affiliates exposed in previous Live Action SexEd releases, have received PREP grants.\n\nThe Minnesota Planned Parenthood counselor states that \u201cthere are lots of things that happen in Fifty Shades of Grey [an explicitly pornographic popular book series] that border on \u2013 um, I wouldn\u2019t say \u2018abuse,\u2019 because it\u2019s consensual, but definitely extreme.\u201d She repeats that \u201cif it\u2019s consensual, again, completely normal\u201d and talks about how her \u201cpatients sometimes come in with rope burns or \u2026 markings on their breasts from, like, clamps.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat else could an underage girl agree to that Planned Parenthood would call \u2018completely normal\u2019?\u201d Rose asked. \u201cCuts? Broken bones? Is child sexual abuse \u2018completely normal\u2019 if the girl thinks she wants it?\u201d\n\n\u201cPlanned Parenthood has covered up the statutory rape of minors for years as well, not taking child sexual abuse seriously. Apparently it\u2019s \u2018yes\u2019 to everything \u2013 to depraved and dangerous behavior \u2013 as long as there\u2019s \u2018consent,'\u201d Rose added.\n\nLive Action continues to demand that legislators defund Planned Parenthood of taxpayer money and that superintendents nationwide expel Planned Parenthood from their schools.\n\n\u201cIt seems that the thing Planned Parenthood is most terrified of telling anyone is \u2018don\u2019t\u2019 \u2013 even if it\u2019s a commonsense warning against the extreme physical, emotional, and mental harm these practices can cause to minors,'\u201d Rose concluded. \u201cThat\u2019s a great way to bring about more teen sexual activity, more teen pregnancy, and more sexual abuse.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Planned Parenthood Counselor to Teen: 'Anything' Sexual Is Normal 'As Long as It's Consensual'", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Planned Parenthood Counselor to Teen: 'Anything' Sexual Is Normal 'As Long as It's Consensual'", "title": "Planned Parenthood Counselor to Teen: 'Anything' Sexual Is Normal 'As Long as It's Consensual' - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2014/Social-and-Family/bondage-legs-AFP.jpg", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2014/08/13/planned-parenthood-minnesota-counselor-to-teen-anything-in-the-sexual-world-is-normal-as-long-as-its-consensual/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Planned Parenthood Counselor to Teen: 'Anything' Sexual Is Normal 'As Long as It's Consensual'", "title": "Planned Parenthood Counselor to Teen: 'Anything' Sexual Is Normal 'As Long as It's Consensual' - Breitbart", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2014/Social-and-Family/bondage-legs-AFP.jpg", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": ",Big Government,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "published_time": "2014-08-13T07:04:00-07:00", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0f57\"", "article_summary": "Live Action continues to demand that legislators defund Planned Parenthood of taxpayer money and that superintendents nationwide expel Planned Parenthood from their schools.\nLive Action observes that Planned Parenthood received over $540 million in taxpayer funds in its last reported fiscal year.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a great way to bring about more teen sexual activity, more teen pregnancy, and more sexual abuse.\u201d\nIs child sexual abuse \u2018completely normal\u2019 if the girl thinks she wants it?\u201d\u201cPlanned Parenthood has covered up the statutory rape of minors for years as well, not taking child sexual abuse seriously.\n\u201cIt seems that the thing Planned Parenthood is most terrified of telling anyone is \u2018don\u2019t\u2019 \u2013 even if it\u2019s a commonsense warning against the extreme physical, emotional, and mental harm these practices can cause to minors,'\u201d Rose concluded."}
