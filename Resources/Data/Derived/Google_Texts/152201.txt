A tip for time travelers. If you need a hotel, see if you can check into a hospital room at Chicago’s Presbyterian Hospital around the turn of the last century.

There you’d find a fireplace, carpets, homey art on the wall, a clock on the mantle, fresh fruit and even a fish bowl, as Rush University Medical Center posts on its Facebook page.

Of course, the accompanying photo of a modern room at Rush is a more familiar environment, and check out that view! If your health network has any historic photos we can feature, please share them with Throwback Thursday and its readers. Send us an email at: bsantamour@healthforum.com.
