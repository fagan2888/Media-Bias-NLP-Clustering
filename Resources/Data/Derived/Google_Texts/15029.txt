The largest health insurer in North Carolina is working to fix glitches that have left some customers worried if they have coverage for the month of January.

The News & Observer of Raleigh reports the North Carolina Department of Justice has sent Blue Cross and Blue Shield a letter asking it to explain what went wrong and how many customers were affected.

The problems have to do with customers - most of them through the Affordable Care Act - not receiving insurance cards on time, unable to verify coverage or able to submit payments.

The insurer says while about 25,000 customers were affected, 94 percent of its individual customers were enrolled on time and accurately. Blue Cross CEO Brad Wilson says the company is working to fix the problems.
