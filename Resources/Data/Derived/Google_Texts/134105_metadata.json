An extensive investigation confirmed that much of the peeled shrimp that makes its way into the American, European and Asian markets is being processed in horrendous conditions by people who have essentially become modern-day slaves.\n\nHere\u2019s what to think about when buying shrimp:\n\nKnow which brands and retailers are tainted by supply chains linked to labor abuses. Shrimp brands and companies found to be compromised include Chicken of the Sea; Darden (owner of Olive Garden and Longhorn Steakhouse); Winn-Dixie; Publix; Red Lobster; Wal-Mart. Supermarkets chosen at random include Publix; Target; Wal-Mart; Whole Foods; Winn-Dixie.\n\nAsk questions: Has it been caught where fishing is allowed while abiding by regulations regarding amounts and protected species? Is it fished or farmed in a way with minimal environmental impact? (See: Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch.) Are workers being treated properly?\n\nRead labels. We know that shrimp from Thailand stands a good chance of being tainted by labor abuses. According to the AP, 90 percent of shrimp in the United States is imported. But look in the right places, and you can find shrimp from Alaska, Texas, Louisiana, Florida and North Carolina for sale.\n\n\u2014 Becky Krystal, The Washington Post", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2014/04/hfnutricolbx22.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "article_summary": "Shrimp brands and companies found to be compromised include Chicken of the Sea; Darden (owner of Olive Garden and Longhorn Steakhouse); Winn-Dixie; Publix; Red Lobster; Wal-Mart.\nQ: How can I be sure I\u2019m eating shrimp that wasn\u2019t peeled by slave labor?\nSupermarkets chosen at random include Publix; Target; Wal-Mart; Whole Foods; Winn-Dixie.\nWe know that shrimp from Thailand stands a good chance of being tainted by labor abuses.\nBut look in the right places, and you can find shrimp from Alaska, Texas, Louisiana, Florida and North Carolina for sale."}
