It tells me that there are more than 44,000 people talking about HealthCare.gov on Facebook. I wonder what they’re saying.

A mass of health care consumers annoyed, confused and stymied by the technical Titanic that is HealthCare.gov have taken to the portal’s associated social media pages to ask questions, log complaints — even just vent about the program in general.

It’s a highly negative and telling visual of the program’s systemic failure in handling customers out of the gate, no matter the circumstances that the administration has cited to date.

“How is it that Facebook, which is a non-essential social networking web site, can reliably handle BILLIONS of electronic interactions per second, but the Healthcare.gov site, which is literally the very heart of the Obamacare program, wasn’t ready for the obvious millions of visitors that you had to know it would be receiving?” one Facebook user asked.

This goes without mentioning the stream of tweets directed at the @HealthCareGov handle, many of which complained about the website’s lacking functionality.

In the words of a friend, HealthCare.gov is ‘having a day’ — or about week’s worth of them now.
