Respondents were asked how well the following words described young people, ages 18-29:\n\nNearly two-thirds (65%) say the term \u201centitled\u201d describes millennials very or somewhat well, but 30 percent said it did not describe the generation well. Seven in 10 say the term \u201cselfish\u201d also describes millennials very or somewhat well, while only 27 percent disagree.\n\nNot all perceptions of millennials are negative. Sixty percent say the term \u201ctolerant\u201d does a good job describing young people, while 38 percent says it does not.\n\nAlthough a majority, decidedly fewer say young people have a strong work ethic. Fifty-five percent say millennials are \u201chard working\u201d and \u201cresponsible\u201d while 43 percent disagree.\n\nSignificant differences between age cohorts emerge on young people\u2019s work ethic and personal responsibility:\n\nFully 77 percent of 18-29 year olds say their cohort is \u201cresponsible\u201d while only 49 percent of Americans over 30 agree. Instead, 48 percent of Americans over 30 says \u201cresponsible\u201d does not describe millennials.\n\nThree-fourths (74%) of 18-29 year olds say their cohort is \u201chard working,\u201d but only 49 percent of people over 30 shares this view. Rather, 47 percent of older Americans say millennials are not hardworking.\n\nThere is generally more agreement among the cohorts on whether young people are entitled or tolerant. Young people are 9 points more likely to say they are tolerant (67% to 58%) and 9 points less likely to say they are entitled (58% to 67%).\n\nInterestingly, Americans under 30 are as likely as those over 30 to say 18-29 year olds are selfish (71%).\n\nRepublicans are considerably less likely to have a favorable view of young people\u2019s work ethic these days. While 64 percent of Democrats say \u201chard working\u201d describes millennials only 45 percent of Republicans agree. Instead a majority (52%) of Republicans say \u201chard working\u201d does not do a good job describing young adults. The same numbers are true for the term \u201cresponsible.\u201d Democrats believe young people are responsible, while most Republicans do not.\n\nRepublicans are also considerably less likely to view millennials as \u201ctolerant.\u201d While 68 percent of Democrats think the term \u201ctolerant\u2019 accurately describes millennials, only 51 percent of Republicans agree.\n\nThe Reason-Rupe national telephone poll, executed by Princeton Survey Research Associates International, conducted live interviews with 1000 adults on cell phones (500) and landlines (500) August 6-10, 2014. The poll\u2019s margin of error is +/-3.7%.
