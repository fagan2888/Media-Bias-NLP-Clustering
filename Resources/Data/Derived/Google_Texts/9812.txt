A ribbon cutting was held for Callawayâ€™s newest business Dynamic Insurance Services on March 11. Longtime friends Lori Pandorf and Liana Hrupek started the business approximately 3 weeks ago.

Pandorf said they worked together for approximately 4 years in the Life Insurance industry but had to do a lot of travelling and wanted to be home with their young families so decided to start their own business.

Hrupek said she previously worked in the medical field and has a good understanding of health insurance. Hrupek said with the Affordable Care Act going in to effect they believe that they can help people walk through the process.

Pandorf and Hrupek both have their Health Insurance License and they represent over 30 companies around the state with products such as Life, Health, Annuities, and Long Term Care.

You will find Dynamic Insurance Services at 115 E. Kimball in Callaway and you can reach them by calling 308-836-2201.
