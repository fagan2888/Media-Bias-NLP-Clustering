A recent Tampa Bay Times/Bay News 9/UF Bob Graham Center poll shows more than half of likely voters either want some changes or a complete repeal of the law.\n\nModerator and Bay News 9 anchor Al Ruechel asked Libertarian Bill Wohlsifer, Democrat George Sheldon and incumbent Republican Pam Bondi about the role of the attorney general when it comes to the Affordable Care Act in Florida.\n\nBILL WOHLSIFER: I have the unique opportunity to sit with two sides of that topic. The Attorney General has led the fight against the Affordable Care Act for the first two years of her term, unsuccessfully for reasons beyond this short discussion, whereas Mr. Sheldon was with the [U.S.] Department of [Health and] Human Services, who participated in the rollout of HealthCare.gov that also had its failures. And also Mr. Sheldon mentioned about the Medicaid doughnut hole we have, the lack of expansion. I think that we have to face the fact that the Affordable Care Act is the law \u2026 it is the law, the attorney general has to implement the law and we also have to reach out to that gap of the poor people who are working and falling between coverage.\n\nAL RUECHEL: Ms. Bondi?\n\nPAM BONDI: I do agree that we have to implement the law, now that it is law. But one point that we did win on, and I\u2019m very proud of challenging that, is that the federal government cannot force us to purchase a product simply by being alive, and that\u2019s a huge win on a much broader level. You cannot force someone to purchase a product. The [rollout] was a disaster. My opponent ran, basically his announcement was saying he was running because I challenged Obamacare, and he helped draft it. This was sold to the American people on the basis of lies \u2013 I\u2019m not saying you lied \u2013 but the law was sold on the basis of a lie, and even the Tampa Bay Times called it the \u201cLie of the Year.\u201d People\u2019s premiums have doubled, people are losing insurance, businesses are hurting, people\u2019s hours are being cut back at work, and this is a tremendous disaster for our state, but I will follow the law.\n\nRUECHEL: Mr. Sheldon, did you help draft it?\n\nGEORGE SHELDON: Well, I appreciate that she\u2019s giving me credit for drafting the Affordable Care Act. It was actually drafted two years before I got there. It passed then. There\u2019s no question that we need to make some adjustments in the Affordable Care Act. I think everybody recognizes that. We did that with Medicare Part D that passed under Ronald Reagan. Democrats opposed it, but they knew it needed some changes. As you talk to people, they don\u2019t want to go back to the days when preexisting conditions were not covered. They don\u2019t want to go back to the days when there were lifetime limits. They don\u2019t want to go back to the days when health insurance didn\u2019t cover basic screenings like mammograms and others. They don\u2019t want to return to those days. Medicaid expansion, one of the things that they fought so hard against, to say we\u2019re not covering 1.1 million people in this state, that\u2019s fundamentally wrong, with 100 percent federal money and the point I would also point out, it\u2019s not federal money. It\u2019s Florida\u2019s money. And where did it go? It went to states like California and New York.\n\nHear more highlights from the debate this week on Florida Matters on Tuesday, Oct. 21 at 6:30 p.m. and Sunday, Oct. 26 at 7:30 a.m. on WUSF 89.7 FM.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Florida Matters", "description": "Florida's candidates for Attorney General met for their first and only debate earlier this month in the studios of Bay News 9.
