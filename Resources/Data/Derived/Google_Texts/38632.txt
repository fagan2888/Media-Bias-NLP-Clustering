CAIRO (AP) â€” Egyptian movie star Omar Sharif has been buried in Cairo following a quiet funeral attended by family and several actors.

The Egyptian-born actor soared to international stardom in two epics, "Lawrence of Arabia" and "Doctor Zhivago," the former of which earned him a supporting-actor Oscar nomination.

Sharif died of a heart attack in a Cairo hospital on Friday at the age of 83.

Mourners gathered for funeral prayers at the Hussein Tantawi Mosque in south Cairo and buried the star at the El Shafie Cemetery later Sunday.

Sharif's son, Tarek, revealed in May that his father had Alzheimer's disease.

Sharif also appeared in the films "Funny Girl," ''Che!" and "The Pink Panther Strikes Again."
