officials in New York and around the U.S. struggled to deal with a flood of Web traffic by people seeking information.\n\nNew York\u2019s new online insurance marketplace \u2014 NYStateof Health.ny.gov \u2014 has attracted more than 30 million visits since it opened Tuesday, Executive Director Donna Frescatore said.\n\nBut visitors to the site Wednesday faced a second day of frustrating log-in problems and processing delays.\n\n\u201cThere is no question that the volume of Web visits that we\u2019ve had over the course of the last two days exceed any projection that we might have made,\u201d Frescatore said.\n\nOfficials were working to boost the website\u2019s ability to handle more traffic, she said.\n\nThe health insurance marketplaces operated by New York, other states and the federal government are a cornerstone of President Barack Obama\u2019s health care reform.\n\nThe marketplaces outside New York also struggled Wednesday to boost capacity.\n\nThe Obama administration hopes to sign up 7 million people for insurance during the first year of the program.\n\nFrescatore said figures on how many people had enrolled in New York since Tuesday morning were
