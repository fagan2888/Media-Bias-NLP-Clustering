Unemployment is down to 5 percent. Yes, everyone wants more money, but we are not in recession. And contrary to the prediction of one of the all-is-dire pitchmen, a massive recession does not loom. The auto industry just had its best year ever. The economy is growing.\n\nAnother old shibboleth is that Americans are miserable on the job. Not so. Americans are workers and most Americans like their jobs and get satisfaction from them. Wages are (too slowly) rising but they are going up. The average gap in economic satisfaction between the upper and lower thirds in income is lower than it was during the Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Clinton or George W. Bush years, according to the respected Index of Consumer Satisfaction.\n\nThe world of work is changing, however, as are the tools needed for the jobs of tomorrow. Change is hard, but Americans are some of the best adapters on Earth. Perhaps no people have exploited opportunity as much as those of this nation. And nothing has dimmed Americans\u2019 desire to innovate and make technology work for them.\n\nSetting record straight\n\nThere have been many flat-out statements that the nation\u2019s new Affordable Care Act would give employers a push to drop health insurance coverage. That has not happened. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, employers are even more determined to provide health benefits than before the law took effect. The percentage of adults under 65 with employer-based insurance held firm for the last five years after steadily declining since 1999. And more than 16 million previously uninsured people now have health insurance.\n\nThe ranks of the Islamic State are filled with badasses who want to kill us and destroy our way of life. And we\u2019ve made enormous mistakes fighting terrorists. But it\u2019s not true the United States is doing little to stop terrorism.\n\nThe U.S. has been destroying the Islamic State\u2019s finances and access to cash. Some units of Islamic State fighters have been unpaid for months. More than 10,000 drone strikes have killed experienced leaders of the Islamic State, reducing its territory and destroying its oil reserves. This is not a war won overnight, but also not one without significant victories.\n\nNuclear weapons could obliterate the planet. But they have not been used for evil, and many are working hard to prevent that.\n\nAt the recent Nuclear Security Summit in Washington, 50 top international leaders revealed their progress. They have removed or secured all the highly enriched uranium and plutonium from more than 50 facilities in 30 countries \u2014 enough to create 150 nuclear weapons, and it\u2019s no longer available to terrorists. Fourteen nations have rid themselves entirely of highly enriched uranium and plutonium. Ukraine, a war zone, no longer has enriched uranium.\n\nIn addition, the U.S. alone got rid of 138 tons of its surplus of highly enriched uranium, enough for 5,500 nuclear weapons. Despite poor relations with Russia, the U.S. is working with it to eliminate enough Russian highly enriched uranium for about 20,000 nuclear weapons, which is being converted to electricity in the U.S.\n\nThe next time you hear someone insist this country is in really bad shape, take it with a grain of salt. And, incidentally, a little bit of daily salt is good for you, according to a study of 100,000 people reported in the New England Journal of Medicine.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Ready for some good news?", "application-name": "", "og": {"site_name": "The Columbian", "description": "Ready for some good news?", "title": "McFeatters: U.S. not on brink of catastrophe", "url": "http://www.columbian.com/news/2016/apr/17/mcfeatters-u-s-not-on-brink-of-catastrophe/", "image": "http://16749-presscdn-0-94.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/themes/columbian/static/img/columbian_c_200x200.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "columbian.com", "site": "@thecolumbian", "card": "summary", "title": "McFeatters: U.S. not on brink of catastrophe"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#3A5B7C", "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"admins": 1256005586, "app_id": 122928857737763}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://16749-presscdn-0-94.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/themes/columbian/static/img/windows-tiles/square-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thecolumbian", "section": "Columns,Opinion", "published_time": "2016-04-17 06:00:48"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "In addition, the U.S. alone got rid of 138 tons of its surplus of highly enriched uranium, enough for 5,500 nuclear weapons.\nThe ranks of the Islamic State are filled with badasses who want to kill us and destroy our way of life.\nMore than 10,000 drone strikes have killed experienced leaders of the Islamic State, reducing its territory and destroying its oil reserves.\nFourteen nations have rid themselves entirely of highly enriched uranium and plutonium.\nSome units of Islamic State fighters have been unpaid for months."}
