People dedicated to preserving Western heritage and promoting the sport of rodeo can help Rhianna Russell of Pine travel across the state and represent Colorado across the country by attending an event Saturday night.

The Miss Rodeo 2014 Colorado Coronation Fundraiser and Appreciation Dinner begins with a cocktail hour and silent auction at 6 p.m. at Denver’s National Western Complex,

4655 Humboldt St.

Dinner starts at 7 p.m. with Colorado beef as the featured dish, followed by a live auction at 8.

The fundraiser will help Russell represent the state at more than 100 rodeos, parades, business openings and the Miss Rodeo America Pageant in December in Las Vegas.

Russell was crowned at the Miss Rodeo Colorado Pageant at the Greeley Stampede in July. She began her reign during the National Western Stock Show last month.

Russell has been competing in rodeo pageants since she was 15, inspired by the leadership and grace of the older girls who wore the crowns before her, she said.

“It’s really an honor to carry on their legacy,” said Russell, 24, a 2008 graduate of Mullen High School.

Russell is studying business and biotechnology at Colorado State University and hopes to work in equine science research.

She is the daughter of Jim and Kimberly Russell.

Russell said she looks forward to representing Western values embodied by rodeo in Colorado — leadership, a love of horses and appreciation for Western heritage.

“I enjoy working with the youth the most because that’s important to carrying our Western culture into the future,” she said.
