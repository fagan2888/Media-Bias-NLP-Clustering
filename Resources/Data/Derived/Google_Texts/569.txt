More than 100 firefighters are suing the city of New Haven in federal court over lost wages.

The New Haven Register reports 174 current and former firefighters claim that the fire department failed to accurately calculate their regular rates for overtime compensation, which they said violates the Fair Labor Standards Act.

Union President James Kottage said the alleged miscalculations have been a problem during the former and current Mayors' administrations.

The firefighters are seeking back pay compensations, liquidated damages equal to each firefighter's unpaid compensation, and other fees.

Kottage said he believes that amount will add up to seven figures.

The city's counsel has declined to comment on the lawsuit.
