Said Lincecum:\n\n\u201cHe made things feel like they weren\u2019t so bad.\u201d\n\nRemembering some of Williams\u2019 early manic groundbreaking appearances on television and movies, the statement rang true, as did the chilling irony in its description of a man who seemingly had everything but clearly thought that things were that bad, after all.\n\nThe suicide rate for white men increased almost 40 percent between 1999 and 2011.\n\nConsidering his suicide, it\u2019s not surprising that Williams\u2019 publicist said Monday that the comedian suffered from severe depression. Williams also struggled with substance abuse issues for decades. Since his death, a national conversation has ensued on the insidious effects of depression, and how it can prove fatal even in those who, to the outside world, seemingly have everything to live for.\n\nAround the country, media organizations have been interviewing mental health experts on the subject. The Chronicle talked to some who worried about the impact of Williams\u2019 suicide on those struggling with depression. \u201cI get concerned about people wondering if people as promising as him with all these resources available can\u2019t make it, what are the chances for them?\u201d Patricia Arean, a UCSF clinical psychologist and psychiatry professor, told the paper.\n\nShe said many people who are depressed often can\u2019t find their way to the appropriate treatment if what they\u2019re currently doing to address their condition isn\u2019t working.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, what happens is that people don\u2019t know enough about their own illness to know if they\u2019re not getting better,\u201d Arean said.\n\nDr. Winston Chung, medical director of inpatient psychiatry at California Pacific Medical Center, said there is still a stigma on those with mental health conditions. Discovering physical traces of mental illness, such as genetic traits and biological markers, could help reduce that stigma, he said.\n\n\u201cWith cancer, you can see the cells under the microscope. In depression, you can\u2019t see it,\u201d Chung told the Chronicle. \u201cThere\u2019s no broken bone, no radiological finding. We need to have concrete evidence, not unlike the cancer cell. Something we can see and reliably associate with mental health issues.\u201d\n\nA Risk: Aging White Men\n\nThe Washington Post writes that Williams belonged to a demographic with an especially high risk of suicide: older white men. \u2026\n\nIf you tried to create a profile of someone at high risk of committing suicide, one likely example would look like this: A middle-aged or older white male toward the end of a successful career, who suffers from a serious medical problem as well as chronic depression and substance abuse, who recently completed treatment for either or both of those psychological conditions and who is going through a difficult period, personally or professionally.\n\nLast year,the federal government reported the suicide rate for white men increased almost 40 percent between 1999 and 2011. And. because white men use more lethal methods, such as shooting themselves, they account for 80 percent of fatalities despite making up just 20 percent of attempts.\n\nAnother factor in the high suicide rate among older men: They are less likely to seek help, Older men may also be prone to reflecting negatively on what they have done with their lives, with an accompanying loss of self-esteem.\n\n\u201cHas the career been worth it, or did I sacrifice my family . . . I think that is part of what happens for people,\u201d Nadine Kaslow, a psychology professor at the Emory University School of Medicine, told the Post.\n\nChristopher Kilmartin, a psychology professor at the University of Mary Washington, said he often refers to aging males as \u201cdevelopmentally unsuccessful, because they\u2019re not equipped to handle the challenges of getting older if they are so tied into their masculinity . . . and making a lot of money.\u201d\n\nSaid Dost Ongur, associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School: \u201cThings aren\u2019t the way they used to be. The power you knew, the control you knew, aren\u2019t the same.\u201d\n\nIn 2010, Williams told fellow comedian Marc Maron, on Maron\u2019s WTF podcast, that he had contemplated suicide in the past. When discussing what caused him to start drinking again in 2005, Williams told Maron, according to the L.A. Times, \u201cIt\u2019s trying to fill the hole, and it\u2019s fear. You\u2019re going, \u2018What am I doing in my career?\u2019 You bottom out. \u2026 People say, \u2018You have an Academy Award.\u2019 The Academy Award lasted about a week, and then one week later people are going, \u2018Hey, Mork!'\u201d\n\nComics Prone to Depression\n\nComics are so prone to depression that the Laugh Factory, a comedy club in Los Angeles, started in-house therapy sessions in 2011. Owner Jamie Masada told the L.A .Times at the time, \u201cThis is serious. This is something we have to do. From Richard Jeni putting a gun in his mouth and blowing himself up [in 2007] to Greg Giraldo taking drugs and overdosing [in 2010], I just can\u2019t stand to watch all of my family, one by one [self-destruct].\n\n\u201cFrom Sam Kinison to Rodney Dangerfield to Paul Rodriguez, Dom Irrera \u2014 every comic, they have a little demon in them.\u201d\n\nClinical psychologist Ildiko L. Tabori told the Times that research indicated a \u201chigher degree of depression and bipolar disorder in comedians.\u201d\n\n\u201cLaughter is a defensive mechanism,\u201d she said.\u201d It\u2019s one of the more mature defense mechanisms, but it still masks whatever it is that\u2019s going on inside.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Post took a look at other comedians who have suffered from depression. Cited is a 2013 TEDxYouth Talk by comedian Kevin Breel called \u201cConfessions of a Depressed Comic.\u201d\n\nBreel is just 20, but he\u2019s already had to battle suicidal urges. Outwardly, he said, he hardly seemed like the type you would suspect would be depressed \u2014 he was a model student and athlete. \u201cDepression isn\u2019t chicken pox,\u201d Breel said. \u201cYou don\u2019t beat it once and then it\u2019s gone forever. It\u2019s something you live with. It\u2019s something you live in. It\u2019s the roommate you can\u2019t kick out. It\u2019s the voice you can\u2019t ignore and the feelings you can\u2019t seem to escape, and the scariest part is, the scariest part is that after awhile, you become numb to it.\u201d\n\nThe Chronicle compiled this list of resources in the Bay Area for those who are undergoing a mental health crisis:\n\n\u2014 Suicide prevention/crisis line: (800) 273-TALK (8255)\n\n\u2014 San Francisco General Hospital Psychiatric Emergency Services: (415) 206-8125\n\n\u2014 For any mental health emergency, call the San Francisco Suicide Prevention\u2019s 24-hour hotline at (415) 781-0500 or go to www.sfsuicide.org.\n\n\u2014 To find mental health help or other social services in Bay Area counties, dial 211 or go to http://211bayarea.org.\n\n\u2014 San Francisco\u2019s Institute on Aging runs The Friendship Line, a hotline specifically for older adults, 1-800-971-0016", "article_metadata": {"description": "Robin Williams' death has prompted a national discussion on depression and those prone to suicide.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"As Aging White Man, Robin Williams Was Particularly at Risk for Suicide\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2014\\/08\\/13\\/as-aging-white-man-and-comic-robin-williams-was-particularly-at-risk-for-suicide\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-08-13 14:39:51\",\"mod_date\":\"2014-08-19 10:59:53\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":20712,\"author_id\":\"80\",\"author_name\":\"Jon Brooks\",\"author_display_name\":\"Jon Brooks\",\"tags\":[\"Mental Health\",\"suicide\"],\"categories\":[\"Living Healthy\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2014\\/08\\/robinwilliams.png\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "Robin Williams' death has prompted a national discussion on depression and those prone to suicide.", "title": "As Aging White Man, Robin Williams Was Particularly at Risk for Suicide", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2014/08/13/as-aging-white-man-and-comic-robin-williams-was-particularly-at-risk-for-suicide/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2014/08/robinwilliams.png", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "mental health,suicide", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Something we can see and reliably associate with mental health issues.\u201dA Risk: Aging White MenThe Washington Post writes that Williams belonged to a demographic with an especially high risk of suicide: older white men.\nThe Chronicle talked to some who worried about the impact of Williams\u2019 suicide on those struggling with depression.\nLast year,the federal government reported the suicide rate for white men increased almost 40 percent between 1999 and 2011.\n\u2014 To find mental health help or other social services in Bay Area counties, dial 211 or go to http://211bayarea.org.\nThe suicide rate for white men increased almost 40 percent between 1999 and 2011."}
