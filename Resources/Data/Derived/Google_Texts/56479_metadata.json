Johnson changed her mind after the Obama administration clarified the immigrants\u2019 legal presence in the country. Civil liberties and immigrants\u2019 rights groups also had sued.\n\nMEDICAID, OTHER STATE SERVICES\n\nImmigrants can apply for assistance such as welfare and Medicaid in Michigan if they have held a Green Card for at least five years. The federally issued card reflects legal permanent status, and holders can eventually apply to become U.S. citizens.\n\nMichigan hasn\u2019t enacted laws to allow or prohibit in-state tuition rates for immigrants living illegally in the U.S. But some of the state\u2019s 15 public universities, including the University of Michigan, have been able to allow such immigrants to pay in-state tuition. The schools are independent under the Michigan Constitution.\n\nWHO IS AFFECTED\n\nMichigan is home to an estimated 75,000 to 150,000 immigrants living in the U.S. illegally, a tiny population compared to states like Texas and California, according to the Migration Policy Institute and other groups that study the issue. Obama\u2019s latest executive order could affect about 35,000 such immigrants in Michigan.\n\nMichigan\u2019s largest population of such immigrants are people from Mexico, followed by immigrants from India, in addition to large populations from Iraq and China.\n\nWHAT\u2019S NEXT\n\nGov. Rick Snyder has said he strongly supports legal immigration and stresses the importance of bipartisan efforts to improve the nation\u2019s immigration policy. The federal government has approved Snyder\u2019s request for Michigan to host only the second center in the U.S. aimed at attracting foreign investors to create jobs and live in the U.S. He also has asked the Obama administration to designate tens of thousands of work visas for Detroit to attract highly skilled, entrepreneurial immigrants.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer David Eggert in Lansing contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Barack Obama's executive action on immigration may protect millions of people illegally living in the U.S. from deportation, but it doesn't mean the states where they live will provide driver's licenses, in-state college tuition or other state services and benefits.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/nov/28/things-to-know-about-immigration-in-michigan/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "President Barack Obama\u2019s executive action on immigration may protect millions of people illegally living in the U.S. from deportation, but it doesn\u2019t mean the states where they live will provide driver\u2019s licenses, in-state college tuition or other state services and benefits.", "title": "Things to know about immigration in Michigan"}, "twitter": {"description": "President Barack Obama's executive action on immigration may protect millions of people illegally living in the U.S. from deportation, but it doesn't mean the states where they live will provide drive", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Things to know about immigration in Michigan"}, "Author": "JEFF KAROUB", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc841\"", "article_summary": "Rick Snyder has said he strongly supports legal immigration and stresses the importance of bipartisan efforts to improve the nation\u2019s immigration policy.\nMichigan hasn\u2019t enacted laws to allow or prohibit in-state tuition rates for immigrants living illegally in the U.S.\nObama\u2019s latest executive order could affect about 35,000 such immigrants in Michigan.\nBut some of the state\u2019s 15 public universities, including the University of Michigan, have been able to allow such immigrants to pay in-state tuition.\nHere\u2019s a look at where immigration policies stand in Michigan:DRIVER\u2019S LICENSESMichigan only provides driver\u2019s licenses to people who can prove they are legally living or working in the U.S."}
