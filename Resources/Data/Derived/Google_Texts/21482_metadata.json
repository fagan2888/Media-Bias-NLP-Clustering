The figure includes $0.5 billion of capital already spent this year and last year.\n\nThe mine, which sits on one of the world\u2019s largest copper and gold deposits, began commercial production last summer and could represent a third of landlocked Mongolia\u2019s economy.\n\nThe latest study, whose publication has been delayed several times, will need to be approved by all the mine\u2019s shareholders and stakeholders before the project can proceed. Oyu Tolgoi is operated by Rio Tinto and 66% owned by Turquoise Hill with the remaining 34% held by the Mongolian government.\n\nDevelopment of the underground mine project was put on hold last summer following a protracted dispute with the Mongolian government over a series of issues, including timing of the revenue stream to be incurred by the government from the project, terms of financing burden, and claims of unpaid taxes, penalties and disallowed entitlements connected with the initial development of Oyu Tolgoi, which cost $6.2 billion to develop.\n\nTurquoise Hill said on Monday that the Mongolian tax authority reduced the initial tax-related charges to about $30 million from $127 million. While Turquoise Hill welcomed the new ruling, it said it would seek further clarity about the latest findings.\n\nWrite to Alex MacDonald at alex.macdonald@wsj.com.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Costs for expanding a massive Mongolian copper mine in which Rio Tinto owns an interest are on the rise, the mine's operator says.", "title": "Rio Tinto Raises Cost Of Oyu Tolgoi Underground Mine Expansion", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/frontiers/2014/09/22/rio-tinto-raises-cost-of-oyu-tolgoi-underground-mine-expansion/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/img/WSJ_profile_lg.gif"}, "site": "frontiermarkets", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Markets", "article.headline": "Rio Tinto Raises Cost Of Oyu Tolgoi Underground Mine Expansion", "description": "Costs for expanding a massive Mongolian copper mine in which Rio Tinto owns an interest are on the rise, the mine's operator says.", "article_section": "Markets", "author": "Alex MacDonald", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Frontier Markets Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Frontier Markets", "article.summary": "Costs for expanding a massive Mongolian copper mine in which Rio Tinto owns an interest are on the rise, the mine's operator says.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-09-22T16:37:46-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-161", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/frontiers/2014/09/22/rio-tinto-raises-cost-of-oyu-tolgoi-underground-mine-expansion/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-265B-1190", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Markets", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Costs for expanding a massive Mongolian copper mine in which Rio Tinto owns an interest are on the rise, the mine's operator says.", "title": "Rio Tinto Raises Cost Of Oyu Tolgoi Underground Mine Expansion", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/frontiers/2014/09/22/rio-tinto-raises-cost-of-oyu-tolgoi-underground-mine-expansion/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/blogs/img/WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Frontier Markets", "article.id": "BL-265B-1190", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-09-22T16:38:07-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd93f5\"", "article_summary": "Oyu Tolgoi is operated by Rio Tinto and 66% owned by Turquoise Hill with the remaining 34% held by the Mongolian government.\nCanada-listed Turquoise Hill Resources, which is 50.8% owned by Rio, said it would cost $5.4 billion to expand the Oyu Tolgoi mine underground, compared with a previous estimate of $5.1 billion.\nEmployees at the Oyu Tolgoi mine in Mongolia.\nWhile Turquoise Hill welcomed the new ruling, it said it would seek further clarity about the latest findings.\nTurquoise Hill said on Monday that the Mongolian tax authority reduced the initial tax-related charges to about $30 million from $127 million."}
