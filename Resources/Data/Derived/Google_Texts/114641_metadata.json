The other 14 states run their own exchanges.\n\nNaff said there are 1.3 million people in Florida who are uninsured and ineligible for subsidies in the federal marketplace.\n\nFlorida has about 3.8 million uninsured people, or about 20 percent of its population, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nFlorida's Governor Rick Scott signed off on state funding of Florida Health Choices while trying to block the Affordable Care Act and rejecting millions of federal dollars to implement it in the state.\n\nFlorida led the legal challenge against Obamacare, but the U.S. Supreme Court in 2012 upheld most provisions of the act. Scott continued to throw roadblocks in the way of Obamacare, banning \"navigators,\" volunteers who help consumers sign up for insurance in the federal marketplace, from operating out of state-funded county health departments.\n\nThe state marketplace was No. 87 in Rubio's 2006 book, \"100 Innovative Ideas for Florida's Future,\" published months before he took over as leader of the Florida House. Rubio made the marketplace a priority and obtained $1.5 million in start-up funding in 2008. Another $900,000 of state funding was awarded in 2013.\n\n\"Florida Health Choices is a program based on principles ObamaCare violated,\" a spokeswoman for Rubio said in a statement on Friday. \"There are no mandates, trillions in new spending, or bureaucratic rules to come between patients and their doctors,\" she added.\n\nGreg Mellowe, policy director at Florida CHAIN, a statewide consumer health advocacy group, said the state's version provided \"an illusion of coverage.\"\n\n\"In some cases, these things are not insurance at all,\" Mellowe added.\n\nNaff said potential Florida Health Choices customers are 525,000 adults who make too much money to qualify for Medicaid. Those same people would qualify for Medicaid coverage if Florida's Republican-dominated legislature would accept $51 billion from the federal government to expand Medicaid's income guidelines, Naff said.\n\nThe legislature, whose leaders fought the Affordable Care Act, declined the money in 2013.\n\nOther potential customers are about 800,000 non-citizens living in the state who are not eligible under the Affordable Care Act, Naff said.\n\n(This version of the story fixes a typo in the headline. It changes \"owns\" to \"own\".)\n\n(Additional reporting by Zachary Fagenson and Caroline Humer.
