(Photo: Ducks Unlimited data ) Story Highlights Jack Miner turned love of hunting into protecting migratory birds.\n\nBanded birds with biblican scripture and fostered a conservation movement.\n\nIlliterate until he was 33, began a successful author and speaker\n\nOn April 10, 1865, the news began spreading about Gen. Robert E. Lee\u2019s surrender at Appomattox Courthouse, Va., the day before. In Dover Center, Ohio, the Miner family was more concerned about their newest and fifth addition, a son, John Thomas.\n\nThough he never received a formal education, and was illiterate until he was 33, Jack Miner launched one of North America\u2019s most comprehensive and successful conservation efforts when he began capturing, banding and releasing wild ducks and geese to track and understand their habits.\n\nMiner\u2019s family moved to Kingsfield, Ontario, in Canada, where they were offered a free homestead; the farming was poor because of the heavy clay soil but the family improvised by farming the clay and starting a tile and brick company.\n\nTo supplement the family income, Jack hunted, trapped and became an expert on the habits of local wildlife.\n\nUnlike many hunters of his era, Miner began to find ways to conserve, manage and enhance the wildlife he hunted. His first conservation efforts focused on the bobwhite quail on the family farm; he built brush shelters to help the small birds survive winters, and planted areas specifically to supplement their feed.\n\nTo take hunting pressure off the \u201cdelicate\u201d bobwhite, Miner began raising Ring-necked pheasant.\n\nThe clay harvesting created several ponds on the farm, which began attracting Canada geese during the spring. Miner had found another bird to capture his attention.\n\nIn 1904, he expanded one of his ponds, and stocked it with seven geese whose wings he had clipped in hopes of attracting more to his land. Within four years, he had an established population.\n\nIn August 1909, Miner built a duck trap; he began banding, affixing a small aluminum band around a bird\u2019s lower leg, with his name, address, a unique number, and a biblical inscription. A hunter in Anderson, S.C., wrote in December than he had recovered the band. It was the first complete record of a migratory bird.\n\nMiner was hooked. He expanded the number of ponds and converted his homestead into a bird sanctuary. The former illiterate began writing about his efforts and making extensive lecture tours to educate hunters and the burgeoning conservation movement.\n\nHe kept working on his duck trap and began successfully trapping and banding geese in 1915.\n\nThe inclusion of scripture on the bands proved to be a catalyst for hunters, poachers and law officers to return tags.\n\nBy 1916, the returned tags began revealing the migration patterns of ducks and geese, both north to the nesting grounds, along the eastern shore of James Bay, Hudson Bay, and as far away as Baffin Island; and south to winter homes in North and South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama and the gulf coasts of Florida.\n\nThe information learned from Miner\u2019s tags helped establish the first international treaty governing migratory birds, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918.\n\nHis homestead became the Jack Miner Bird Sanctuary, one the first migratory sanctuaries in North America. It is 10 miles away from the well-known birding destination Point Pelee National Park, which Miner helped to designate as a national park in 1918.\n\nReach Frank Daniels III: 615-881-7039 and on Twitter @fdanielsiii.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://tnne.ws/PTvcjF", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Ducks, geese and other migratory birds are the world\u2019s great travellers, but until John Thomas \u201cJack\u201d Miner began capturing and banding wild ducks and Canada geese little was know about their habits.", "og": {"site_name": "The Tennessean", "description": "Ducks, geese and other migratory birds are the world\u2019s great travellers, but until John Thomas \u201cJack\u201d Miner began capturing and banding wild ducks and Canada geese little was know about their habits.", "title": "Jack Miner established hunter-led conservation", "url": "http://www.tennessean.com/story/opinion/columnists/teachable-moments/2014/04/10/jack-miner-established-hunter-led-conservation/7522193/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/tennessean.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Ducks, geese and other migratory birds are the world\u2019s great travellers, but until John Thomas \u201cJack\u201d Miner began capturing and banding wild ducks and Canada geese little was know about their habits.", "title": "Jack Miner established hunter-led conservation", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/dab2663a516b957dae3f97d539d12a2b5e0000b4/c=2-0-1009-1007&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/04/09/duckbandsources.jpg", "creator": "@tennessean", "site": "@tennessean", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600028886", "fb": {"app_id": 121487414583460}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Geography/North America", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Geography/North America", "title": "Jack Miner established hunter-led conservation", "author": "Frank Daniels III", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "opinion/columnists/teachable-moments", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/67359244e3bf94c767e6867552affef583ea8968/c=128-0-883-1007/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/04/09/duckbandsources.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/76614c3ba67d94b0d3fca0945f13f938efb83d3e/c=2-0-1009-1007/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/04/09/duckbandsources.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2780c253bd2f4bba030161753e1ec2714c98ffb2/c=0-124-1011-882/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/04/09/duckbandsources.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ee138094e222c6d8308a0d2ae727a84df5af1155/c=0-219-1011-788&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/04/09/duckbandsources.jpg", "publishtime": "2014-04-09T23:17:04.267000-05:00", "shorthed": "Miner started hunter-led conservation", "articleid": 7522193, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/dc7805628c9a1761fbcd292c27895f58b3d7c9bc/c=0-219-1011-788/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/04/09/duckbandsources.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/17e6ba24965359bff29a176e27a5b93c06d0b11a/c=222-0-788-1007/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/04/09/duckbandsources.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": ""}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce1a7\"", "article_summary": "In Dover Center, Ohio, the Miner family was more concerned about their newest and fifth addition, a son, John Thomas.\n(Photo: Ducks Unlimited data ) Story Highlights Jack Miner turned love of hunting into protecting migratory birds.\nUnlike many hunters of his era, Miner began to find ways to conserve, manage and enhance the wildlife he hunted.\nDucks, geese and other migratory birds are the world\u2019s great travellers, but until John Thomas \u2018Jack\u2019 Miner began capturing and banding birds little was know about their habits.\nThe information learned from Miner\u2019s tags helped establish the first international treaty governing migratory birds, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918."}
