Rubio on policy. @TeamMarco\u2014 Avik Roy (@Avik) October 12, 2015\n\n\n\n\n\nRubio, who currently sits fourth in the Washington Examiner's latest power rankings, returned the favor with a tweet welcoming him to the team.\n\n.@Avik Welcome to the team! Glad to have you on board.\u2014 Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) October 12, 2015\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Avik is helping us as a volunteer adviser,\" Rubio communications director Alex Conant told the Examiner on Roy's hire. \"We appreciate his support as Marco lays out his agenda for a new American Century.\"\n\nWhile Roy has jumped on the team, he has not always seen eye to eye with Rubio over the past few months. In a May column, Roy criticized the tax reform plan laid out by Rubio and Sen. Mike Lee, saying it promotes \"social engineering\", as the plan includes a new child tax credit of $2,500 which would be refundable against income and payroll taxes.\n\nRoy argued that there is no evidence that the child tax credit would actually produce more children, and that the plan would eliminate taxes in one way or another for a large part of the population, adding that the U.S. tax code is the most progressive in \"the industrialized world\" and would be made worse by the plan.\n\nRoy joins Rubio's team ahead of the third Republican presidential debate, which will focus on the economy. The 2016 hopeful currently sits third in the latest RealClearPolitics national average with 9.9 percent, with only Donald Trump and Ben Carson leading him.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sen.
