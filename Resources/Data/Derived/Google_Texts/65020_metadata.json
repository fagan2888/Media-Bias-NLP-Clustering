If so, this raises serious questions that could shake up financing models.\n\nIn 2004, Pennsylvania implemented a tax on the income of Medicaid managed care organizations. Five years later, when that type of income tax was prohibited by the federal Deficit Reduction Act, the state started levying a 5.9 percent gross revenue tax on MCOs.\n\nNow, Medicaid\u2019s watchdog, the Department of Health and Human Services Inspector General, is questioning whether that\u2019s actually allowed under federal policy, suspecting that the tax was designed as a way to obtain more federal funding and reduce the state\u2019s share of Medicaid payments.\n\nBetween the 2010 and 2012 fiscal years, Pennsylvania collected gross receipts tax revenues of $1.8 billion from its Medicaid MCOs, directing the funding to its share of Medicaid managed care costs. According to the HHS Inspector General, Pennsylvania also covered most of the tax for MCOs, about $1.6 billion, through supplemental payments in capitated rates.\n\nThat type of arrangement seems to be a \u201chealthcare-related tax that is impermissible for Medicaid funding,\u201d since MCOs are \u201cheld harmless,\u201d or reimbursed for the tax, the OIG wrote in a recent audit.\n\nAccording to Medicaid regulations, \u201crevenues from an impermissible healthcare-related tax may not be used to finance the State's share of Medicaid expenditures,\u201d OIG staff argued.\n\nBetween 2010 and 2012, the feds paid $981 million for the supplemental payments. By using revenues from gross receipt tax, auditors wrote, Pennsylvania effectively \u201clowered its share of MCO capitation payments and increased the federal share.\u201d\n\nThe OIG is recommending that the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services take a hard look at Pennsylvania\u2019s scheme and determine whether it is allowable \u2014 lest other states start getting ideas to garner more federal funding. \u201cA proliferation of such tax programs could have a harmful impact on the Medicaid program,\u201d the OIG wrote.\n\nThe OIG also suggested that CMS consider trying to recoup some the payments made to Pennsylvania, whose Medicaid program covers 2.2 million residents at an annual cost of about $24 billion.\n\nCMS does agree that Pennsylvania's gross receipts tax on Medicaid MCOs \"may be considered a healthcare-related tax\u201d that is is not permitted and that guidance is needed. But the agency doesn\u2019t believe it will offset any extra federal funding by adjusting future payments to the state. If the tax does turn out to be impermissible, the agency says it will work with Pennsylvania to develop a legal tax structure.\n\nUnresolved tax issues\n\nThe issue of taxing Medicaid managed care organizations is a complicated one \u2014 and bound to become even more so under the Affordable Care Act\u2019s insurance fee.\n\nStates are allowed to tax healthcare services and direct the funds to their Medicaid budgets, but only within limits that Pennsylvania\u2019s tax seems to exceed, according to the OIG. The taxes have to be broad-based and uniform, applying to all services within one of 19 classes, and cannot be returned directly or indirectly to the taxpayers, in this case the MCOs.\n\nThere are also two safe harbors for the tax, neither of which Pennsylvania meets, the OIG argues. One is a requirement that the tax be less than 5.5 percent of the organization\u2019s revenue \u2014 Pennsylvania\u2019s is 5.9 percent. The other, if the tax does exceed 5.5 percent of revenue, is that no more than 75 percent of the tax can be refunded \u2014 and Pennsylvania has returned more than 85 percent of the tax to MCOs.\n\nResponding to the OIG, Pennsylvania Medicaid director Leesa Allen challenged the interpretation of the tax as out of compliance with the Deficit Reduction Act\u2019s Medicaid regulations. She maintained that the \u201chold harmless\u201d rules barring refunds of the tax to healthcare organizations do not prohibit reimbursements for expenditures.\n\nAllen also noted that CMS \u201caffirmatively approved Pennsylvania's managed care contracts and payment structure recognizing and reimbursing the (gross receipts tax) as an allowable cost for federal claiming purposes.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/medicaid-managed-care-taxes-scrutinized", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/modules/open_graph/hfn-stacked.jpeg", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "States' taxing of Medicaid managed care organizations to raise revenue for state-share Medicaid payments may be illegal, according to the HHS Inspector General.
