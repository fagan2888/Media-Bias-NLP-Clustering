At almost half of all Catholic colleges, low-income students graduate with more than $20,000 in federal loans. (See our Debt by Degrees interactive, which shows how American colleges compare in how much federal student loan debt students accumulate.)\n\nAt Catholic University of America in Washington D.C., where Pope Francis is scheduled to speak on Wednesday, the school\u2019s poorest students pay over $31,000 a year in tuition, even after discounts from scholarships \u2014 more than any other research university in the nation. Students also graduate with a significant amount of debt: $26,000. And just 12 percent of its students are low-income.\n\nGerald Beyer, a Christian ethics professor from Villanova University said schools should be doing more. \u201cEmpowering the poor is a key part of Catholic social teaching, and education is an essential means of achieving this goal,\u201d he said. \u201cCatholic institutions need to rethink their own policies.\u201d\n\nSeveral schools, including Catholic University, said financial struggles have limited their ability to provide aid. Catholic University recently laid off a handful of staff members. The school also points to its relatively modest endowment: $308 million.\n\n\u201cWe are unfortunately not a school with an endowment that starts with a B,\u201d said Christopher Lydon, vice president for enrollment management and marketing at Catholic University. (Last year, the Hechinger Report also explored the lack of financial aid to poor students at Catholic University and other Catholic schools.)\n\nNotre Dame, Boston College, and Georgetown \u2014 all Catholic schools with endowments worth more than a billion dollars \u2014 offer more generous financial aid to their poorest students.\n\nBut like Catholic University, the schools don\u2019t enroll many of them. The percentage of students who receive Pell grants \u2014 federal grants for students whose families typically earn under $30,000 \u2014 is less than 14 percent at each of the schools. Nonprofit four-year colleges on average have around 40 percent Pell grant recipients.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Colleges are saddling low-income students with massive debt, and those that aren't offer support to a select few", "title": "Pope Francis\u2019 message is completely lost on Catholic universities", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Colleges are saddling low-income students with massive debt, and those that aren't offer support to a select few", "title": "Pope Francis\u2019 message is completely lost on Catholic universities", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/09/26/how_catholic_universities_impede_pope_francis_altruistic_aims_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/09/shutterstock_45867115.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Colleges are saddling low-income students with massive debt, and those that aren't offer support to a select few", "title": "Pope Francis\u2019 message is completely lost on Catholic universities", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/09/shutterstock_45867115.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Annie Waldman", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, catholic universities, Georgetown, Higher education, Notre Dame, ProPublica", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "(Last year, the Hechinger Report also explored the lack of financial aid to poor students at Catholic University and other Catholic schools.)\n\u201cCatholic institutions need to rethink their own policies.\u201dSeveral schools, including Catholic University, said financial struggles have limited their ability to provide aid.\nAt almost half of all Catholic colleges, low-income students graduate with more than $20,000 in federal loans.\nCatholic University recently laid off a handful of staff members.\n\u201cWe are unfortunately not a school with an endowment that starts with a B,\u201d said Christopher Lydon, vice president for enrollment management and marketing at Catholic University."}
