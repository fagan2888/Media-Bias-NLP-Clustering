I\u2019m walking past Rep. Paul Ryan\u2019s district office. Except for some people waiting for a bus, there\u2019s nobody else outside.\n\nI\u2019ve come here from Chicago on a sort of anthropological mission: Over the next four days, I\u2019ll see Paul Ryan\u2019s congressional district in southern Wisconsin, Michele Bachmann\u2019s district in the suburbs of the Twin Cities, and Steve King\u2019s district in western Iowa \u2013 a 1,200 mile drive across the Midwest in search of the region\u2019s secrets. I\u2019m not sure what I expect to find, but I hope visiting these places, and trying to understand them, will shed some light on the political right wing currently waging war on the federal government \u2014 or at least paint a portrait of the culture they were birthed from.\n\nTall order for a road trip, I know.\n\nRyan\u2019s Janesville office is wildly unassuming, considering the breadth of his influence. Elected to the House in 1998, he rose to national prominence in 2011 when he became chairman of the House Budget Committee, and quarterbacked the GOP\u2019s much-loathed 2012 budget proposal \u2014 seeking to slash government programs and repeal the Affordable Care Act, while of course leaving Bush-era tax cuts for the wealthy untouched. Though the Ryan Budget proved unpopular with the American public, it instantly became the right\u2019s economic blueprint, catapulting the representative from Wisconsin\u2019s 1st district to A-list status in the GOP.\n\nRyan became the party\u2019s fastest-rising star since She Who Must Not Be Named \u2013 a young, attractive conservative who was able to translate the right\u2019s addled rage into measured, level-sounding politico-speak. When the party needed someone to give a shot of adrenaline to Mitt Romney\u2019s beige presidential bid, they tapped Ryan. And his home office is right here, on the main drag of a suburban city, just down the block from an Edible Arrangements and a sports bar.\n\nI\u2019m not sure what I was expecting. People casually sporting tri-cornered hats? Mobs burning copies of the Nation and Mother Jones?\n\nI\u2019m from Illinois, which means virtually every vacation I ever took as a kid was to Wisconsin. Janesville, where you still see Bears flags outside some of the houses, isn\u2019t all that different from the area near Chicago I grew up in. It\u2019s mostly white, middle-class and \u2013 in true Midwest fashion \u2013 completely unassuming. The streets are tree-lined, the pavement a mosaic of autumn leaves. The houses are old and still cobwebbed from Halloween. Occasionally, you\u2019ll see a \u201cPROUD UNION HOME\u201d sign in a front-room window or a car with a \u201cROMNEY 2012\u2033 bumper sticker, but that\u2019s about it for overt political gestures.\n\nThe town is hilly and the hills are real climbers. Big parks are verdant even in mid-fall. Bars and restaurants and churches and strip malls; there\u2019s nothing about Janesville that particularly jumps out at you, but that\u2019s sort of the point. Places like this are retreats from metropolitan stimulation, the buzz of the city traded for the halcyon still-frame of suburbia. Janesville is boring, but kind of on purpose.\n\nIt is, above all else, comfortable.\n\n* * *\n\nPeople in the country drive like assholes. City drivers have a reputation for being aggressive, but this is of a different kind entirely. The city\u2019s aggressive drivers squeeze in front of you in bumper-to-bumper traffic, or blaze past the evening commute on the shoulder of a highway. It\u2019s all part of the Busy Professional self-centeredness thing that leads people to talk on their cellphones while ordering at Starbucks, or convert their train seats into mobile offices. In short, it\u2019s all about getting there quicker and filling in the quiet moments of the day with some form of stimulation. The country\u2019s aggressive drivers, on the other hand, all but bully you with their vehicles, which seem bigger and more threatening out here. They ride your tail relentlessly but don\u2019t pass when you slow down. For miles, snarling pickups match my speed, close enough in my rearview to see the creases on the face of each driver.\n\nI\u2019m not actually positive this is the country, though. It\u2019s entirely possible it just seems like the country to my untrained eye. I once worked as a reporter for a newspaper in a small town about 70 miles southwest of Chicago, and told everybody I worked in Central Illinois. People I grew up with from the Chicago area would invariably take this at face value, but people who were actually from Central Illinois \u2014 small towns etched into map-flat fields of corn and soybean \u2014 would invariably laugh me off. That\u2019s not Central Illinois, they\u2019d say. I might as well have been working in the Loop.\n\nAnyway, it feels to me like the middle of nowhere, even though I can\u2019t be more than an hour away from Milwaukee. I pass through towns like Darien (pop: 1,580), which appear like a Bruce Springsteen song: two rows of old storefronts whose main drag terminates into two huge grain elevators. The road twines through expansive farmland; this is dairy country and cows are everywhere. They lay on their stomachs in an almost-feline way, with their front legs tucked underneath them and their back legs sprawled to the side. An old wives\u2019 tale holds that a pasture of supine cows portends a coming rainstorm. Explanations abound, ranging from the semi-anthropomorphic (cows lie down to claim a dry patch of grass) to the dubiously scientific (something about the pores in their legs), but only the most deeply superstitious really give them weight. Still, the cows are lying down as I listen to predictions of heavy rain across the region, so perhaps our bovine meteorologists are onto something.\n\nEvery town I pass through feels more or less the same. Each features a bucolic downtown hub surrounded by strip malls, chain restaurants and big box stores. In one sense, the sameness is sort of depressing: Nothing, you realize, is as unique as you think it is. And yet, another part of me feels an odd comfort in the familiarity \u2014 the sense that, no matter where you go, you\u2019re never too far from a place that feels kind of like home.\n\n* * *\n\nI\u2019m staying with my friend Guillermo in Madison tonight. One of my best friends since high school, he\u2019s getting his master\u2019s at University of Wisconsin \u2014 a full-on Wisconsin resident now \u2014 which still seems surreal to me. By 25, I no longer bat an eye when save-the-dates arrive in the mail, but seeing the out-of-state driver\u2019s licenses of childhood friends still weirds me out. Long-term monogamous relationships, I\u2019m used to. People I grew up with slowly morphing into Seattle Seahawks fans? That I am not.\n\nAs a liberal, I\u2019ve always loved Madison, even if it\u2019s probably coasting to some degree on the lefty bona fides it earned during the \u201960s. In many ways, it\u2019s similar to San Francisco and Greenwich Village \u2014 places that once served as the center of counterculture, then gradually became bubbles for wealthier white liberals to live in. It\u2019s still a progressive city \u2014 still a hub of progressive thought \u2014 but it no longer feels like a place of progressive action. This is an important distinction.\n\nI could be completely wrong, though. In 2011, 100,000 people descended on the Capitol building here to protest Gov. Scott Walker\u2019s anti-union budget plan. It was a losing battle, but they fought it hard. I\u2019m standing outside the Capitol building now. Night\u2019s fallen, and under the ink-black sky, the lit rotunda is indescribably beautiful. It\u2019s the tallest building in Madison \u2014 a city ordinance forbids any structure within a mile from being taller \u2014 and atop its central dome is perched the \u201cGolden Lady\u201d statue, looking down over the city and pointing forward, into the future.\n\n* * *\n\nTuesday, 8 a.m. Two hours on I-90 so far, northwest toward the Minnesota border. It\u2019s cold and sunless and foggy enough that seeing the car immediately ahead becomes somewhat difficult. I\u2019m approaching a billboard for an adult store, which promises to make \u201cit\u201d better. That the pronoun \u201cit\u201d is just understood to mean \u201csex\u201d says a lot about our culture, doesn\u2019t it? The French have la petite mort, which is plenty aggrandizing in its own right, but at least it\u2019s poetic. \u201cIt,\u201d simultaneously concealing the subject and putting it on a pedestal, makes us sound like a country of randy teenagers. Which I suppose isn\u2019t that far off.\n\nAdult stores are advertised with great frequency out on the highway. The road is lonely, and it\u2019s easy to view sex as the ultimate panacea to loneliness. It\u2019s connection with another person. It takes you outside yourself. That\u2019s what makes it a \u201clittle death\u201d \u2014 for its duration, you cease to exist.\n\nObviously, though, adult video emporiums aren\u2019t selling you sex \u2013 they\u2019re selling you the idea of sex. The idea of connection, of getting away from yourself. We\u2019ve put so many constructs in place to stave off loneliness: We check our email on our cellphones, engage constantly on social media. I sometimes wonder if we installed radios in our cars not to eliminate boredom, but to keep the quiet at bay, afraid of what we might find in the solitude.\n\n* * *\n\nDriving gives a person plenty of time to think about what they believe in.\n\nI believe, for one, in compromise. I believe liberals and conservatives agree on more than we realize, and that much of today\u2019s hyper-partisanship stems from our having retreated into the comfort of our own camps, where if we\u2019re liberal we can watch MSNBC or if we\u2019re conservative we can watch Fox, and each listen all day to opinions we already agree with. I believe that, for the most part, people are good and want what\u2019s best for the country we all love, but have different approaches to solving our most complex problems, that we would find common ground through respectful, sober discussion. I believe getting out of our comfort zones, and not just dismissing the other side as evil or crazy, would move the country forward.\n\nBut what if the other side doesn\u2019t want to compromise? What if they\u2019ve actually campaigned on a refusal to compromise? And what if someone\u2019s views aren\u2019t just different than yours, but abhorrent, or just plain silly?\n\nThis is what I decided to call the Bachmann Conundrum.\n\nMichele Bachmann, since her election to Congress in 2006, has been a greatest-hits collection of outrageous right-wing talking points. She doesn\u2019t believe in global warming, arguing that carbon dioxide is a \u201charmless gas.\u201d She also shamelessly traffics in race-tinged paranoia: In 2008, she was concerned then-candidate Barack Obama \u201cmay have anti-American views\u201d; and in 2012, she suggested that the Muslim Brotherhood had begun a \u201cdeep penetration into the halls of our United States government.\u201d And of course, she\u2019s a career homophobe, terming homosexuality \u201cpersonal enslavement\u201d and \u201csexual anarchy.\u201d\n\nWhere do you start coming to a compromise with someone who believes homosexuality is a disorder and opposed anti-bullying legislation on the grounds that there have always been bullies and to legislate against it would force \u201cboys to be girls\u201d?\n\nThat\u2019s the Bachmann Conundrum.\n\n* * *\n\nMinnesota\u2019s 6thCongressional District covers the northern suburbs of the Twin Cities. The district is upwards of 95 percent white and largely middle- to upper-middle class. If you\u2019ve seen a suburb you\u2019ve seen these. Historic downtowns surrounded by a sprawl of car dealerships, office parks, malls. Target, Wal-Mart, K-Mart \u2013 the same stores as Wisconsin and Illinois, and everywhere else for that matter. Stately old houses, ugly cookie-cutter subdivisions. Nothing particularly mesmerizing about them.\n\nBachmann\u2019s district office is in her hometown of Anoka, about half an hour north of Minneapolis. People here, like everywhere I visit during the course of the trip, tend not to volunteer their deepest-held political opinions to random passersby, such as myself, in the middle of their daily routines.\n\nI meet both Republicans and Democrats, and ask general questions about their views on national politics. Sample response: \u201cThey all need to grow up.\u201d\n\nAnd yet, despite disenchantment with politicians as a whole, gentle prodding frequently reveals partisan sentiments lurking below the surface. People all seem to want the same things \u2013 fairness, stability \u2013 but often have different ideas about what those qualities entail, and what sorts of legislation can steer us there. In settings where they feel comfortable talking politics, people occasionally give off the affect of talking points. Still, most of those I encounter \u2014 say, at a gas station in Ham\u2019s Lake, Minn. \u2014 politely inform me:\n\n\u201cI\u2019d prefer not to be interviewed.\u201d\n\nIn Anoka, folks are much more keen to discuss Halloween. The town bills itself as the \u201cHalloween Capital of the World,\u201d and features Halloween iconography on its permanent signage. Houses are still completely decked out nearly a week into November, which is all \u2013 needless to say \u2013 extremely cool.\n\nMichele Bachmann, it turns out, hails from the Halloween Capital of the World.\n\nA coffee shop owner tells me the town earned its distinction by hosting what apparently was America\u2019s first Halloween parade in 1920. As the story goes, some local civic leaders were brainstorming a way to keep the youth of Anoka free of mischief, and decided that a structured celebration would cut down on pranks and vandalism. The strategy worked, and now the yearly celebration has grown to include two parades, a house-decorating contest, and a slew of other events relating to the holiday.\n\n\u201cYou missed out on all the decorations,\u201d a lady who works at the coffee shop tells me as she prepares a sandwich. Above my head, ghoulish figures are still dangling on wires from the ceiling.", "article_metadata": {"description": "One liberal, three GOP strongholds: What a drive through Ryan and Bachmann country says about America right now", "author": "Eric Lutz", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "One liberal, three GOP strongholds: What a drive through Ryan and Bachmann country says about America right now", "title": "Travels with right-wing nuts: My road trip on Route GOP with Paul Ryan and Michele Bachmann", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/12/08/my_road_trip_on_route_gop/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/12/bachmann_ryan_road.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "One liberal, three GOP strongholds: What a drive through Ryan and Bachmann country says about America right now", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/12/bachmann_ryan_road.jpg", "title": "Travels with right-wing nuts: My road trip on Route GOP with Paul Ryan and Michele Bachmann", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Travels with right-wing nuts: My road trip on Route GOP with Paul Ryan and Michele Bachmann", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Editor's Picks, Michele Bachmann, Paul Ryan, Republican Party, roadtrip, Steve King", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1f60\"", "article_summary": "Bachmann\u2019s district office is in her hometown of Anoka, about half an hour north of Minneapolis.\nI\u2019m walking past Rep.
