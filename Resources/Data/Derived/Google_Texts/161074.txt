Though she was referring to Jacqueline Bisset’s bizarre acceptance speech, Mia Farrow could have summed up the entire 2014 Golden Globes when she wrote, “a little too strange even for me” on Twitter. Perhaps it was the abundance of alcohol, or the fact that no one bothers to prepare speeches for these things anymore — but every acceptance speech seemed even weirder than the one before. Here are the five most awkward speeches of the Hipster Golden Globes, as critic Ryan McGee called the show:

Jacqueline Bisset for best supporting actress in a series, miniseries or TV movie, “Dancing on the Edge.”

Jennifer Lawrence for best actress in a supporting role in a movie, “American Hustle.”

Alex Ebert for best original score, “All Is Lost.”

Jon Voight for best supporting actor in a series, miniseries or TV movie, “Ray Donovan.”

And last but not least, Diane Keaton accepting the Cecil B. DeMille Award for Woody Allen.
