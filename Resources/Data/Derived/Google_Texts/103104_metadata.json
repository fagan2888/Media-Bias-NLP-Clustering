Contrary to the popular public-school-kid myth, eight days of presents doesn\u2019t mean the holiday is super-Christmas; it means the presents are junk, a proliferation of crap. Dreidl is a terrible game that requires no strategy and practically no skill. Somehow, the world\u2019s entire gelt supply seems to have been manufactured in 1993, so even if you do win, your reward is stale, filmy-white, sub-par chocolate. Worst of all, Jews are forever manufacturing kitschy alternatives to Christmas customs: What\u2019s with the Hanukkah bear, anyways? Arguably, latkes are one merit of the Festival of Lights, but woe to the holiday that relies upon potatoes as its only defense. The story of Hanukkah doesn\u2019t even appear in the Torah\u2014the books of 1 and 2 Maccabees are in the Catholic Bible, not the Hebrew one. The saga is briefly described in the Talmud\u2014a tale of armed Jewish rebellion against the Hellenistic King Antiochus IV, paired with a parable about miracle oil that kept the eternal flame of the Temple burning for eight nights when it should have only lasted for one. It is both theologically thin and celebratory of violent nationalism. For most of Jewish history, the holiday has been of little consequence. \u201cHanukkah is \u2026 a minor holiday that America has elevated into something much more,\u201d said Josh Plaut, the head rabbi at the Reform Metropolitan Synagogue in New York City. \u201cJews have been part of that magnification of Hanukkah. It suits our purposes.\u201d Related Story Hanukkah With the Jews for Jesus So why, in America, has Hanukkah taken on outsized significance? Because it serves a particular purpose: an opportunity to negotiate the twin, competing pressures of ethnic tension and assimilation. As the Rowan University historian Dianne Ashton writes in her book, Hanukkah in America, \u201cHanukkah\u2019s strongest American advocates seem to have been those who felt the complexities of American Jewish life most acutely.\u201d It\u2019s so simple, so conveniently vague, that it has been used by rabbis, advertisers, Zionists, Hebrew school teachers, and parents to promote everything from ethnic pride and nationalism to engagement in Jewish life and buying stuff. No doubt, Hanukkah is an incredibly important part of the story of Jews in America. Why, then, is this holiday\u2014the most public Jewish celebration in the United States\u2014so silly?\n\n* * * Like much of Jewish American life, Hanukkah\u2019s evolution in the U.S. is a story of immigrants. In the 19th century, the Jewish population in the United States was very small\u2014roughly 250,000 by 1880, Ashton estimates. As different groups of immigrant Jews came to the country from central and Eastern Europe, a debate emerged: \u201cWhat is going to be the form of Judaism that will thrive in the United States?\u201d Ashton said. Many of the institutions of Jewish life, such as schools and synagogues, were in Europe; coming to America was starting over, and in a very new context. \u201cFreedom of religion was a shocking experience,\u201d she said. \u201cJews had not encountered that before.\u201d In the middle of the 19th century, some of the first Jews to promote Hanukkah in America were the rabbis who led the Reform Movement, which was largely based in Cincinnati, Ohio. Their Judaism was intellectual and sermon-heavy\u2014\u201cit really had nothing for the kids,\u201d Ashton said. So \u201cthey came up with this idea of a synagogue festival for kids at Hanukkah as a way to interest kids in the synagogue: candle-lighting, singing songs, teaching the kids little skits, and then treating them to oranges and ice cream.\u201d During this period in American history, Hanukkah wasn\u2019t really celebrated in the home beyond the lighting of the menorah, Ashton said, but it did have certain domestic qualities. \u201cThe rabbis would stand up in the front [of the synagogue] and talk to the kids, but the women organized the kids, and fed the kids, and taught the kids the songs,\u201d she said. This, in itself, was another way of reinforcing synagogue life, creating a role for women in promoting children\u2019s education. This was in keeping with a larger trend in American culture: a sentimental Victorian fascination with domesticity. A number of home-based festivals, such as birthday parties, emerged in the second half of the 19th century, and Hanukkah crept toward the home along similar lines. One of the Cincinnati rabbis, Isaac Mayer Wise, purposefully played into this. Over the course of 39 weeks around 1860, he serialized a romance novel based on the story of the Maccabees, playing into Victorian tropes like \u201creligious virtues, patriotism, and strong gender distinctions,\u201d Ashton writes. This was a way of educating Jews about Hanukkah, but it was also a form of reassurance: Yes, Jews could be part of American culture.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the cheap and dirty way of looking at it\u2014that Hanukkah is penis envy.\u201d Elsewhere in the United States, some Jewish communities were wary of their surrounding culture. \u201cImmigrant Jews had a deep and abiding anxiety about Christmas\u2014this commercialized, merry, fun, sparkly Christmas was altogether new to them,\u201d said Jenna Weissman Joselit, a professor of history at George Washington University. Toward the end of the 19th century, as more and more kids entered public schools, this fear grew. \u201cThe Yiddish press, particularly the Jewish Daily Forward, sought to explain America to these new immigrants,\u201d she said. \u201cThey spent a lot of time trying to defang Christmas and assuage any concerns that pogrom was at their doorstep.\u201d Memories lingered from events like the Warsaw pogrom of 1881, when Jewish businesses were destroyed and their owners attacked for two days around Christmas time. If only by an accident of timing, Hanukkah served as a counter-balance to this fear of Christmas in Jewish communities\u2014its celebration was a way of asserting Jewish identity. There may have been mild elements of competition to it, too. \u201cThat\u2019s the cheap and dirty way of looking at it\u2014that Hanukkah is penis envy, that Jews need to have their own equivalent of Christmas,\u201d Weissman Joselit said. But it also marked all sorts of other things, such as Jews\u2019 economic success, especially in places like New York City. \u201cImmigrants needed reassurance that they were succeeding, that this gamble of coming to the U.S., to this new country an ocean away from everyone they know, was worth [it],\u201d Ashton said. \u201cOne measure of success was being able to buy presents for their children.\u201d And so the Hanukkah industry emerged. Yiddish newspapers made money by running advertisements for gifts\u2014\u201c\u2018presents\u2019 was one of the earliest words that appeared in English in Yiddish newspapers,\u201d Ashton said. Restaurant owners crafted special dishes for the holiday; shopkeepers made toys for parents to buy. This commercialization had the effect of \u201cundermining traditional religious authority, empowering ordinary Jews, and tying religion inextricably to the market,\u201d Ashton wrote.\n\nAs Jews suburbanized in the middle of the century, the holiday suburbanized along with them, Weissman Joselit said. The kid-centered-ness of Hanukkah fit well with broader Leave It To Beaver norms of American culture. \u201cI came across recipes [from] the \u201840s and \u201850s: little Maccabees fashioned out of cottage cheese or tuna fish,\u201d she said. As Hanukkah grew, so did the complexities of American Judaism. The holiday had been connected with Zionism for decades before the 1950s; Theodore Herzl, one of the founders of the movement, \u201cplaced the celebration of Hanukkah in the center of the modern Jew\u2019s capacity to bolster one\u2019s own self-respect while living as a minority,\u201d Ashton writes. But particularly in the \u201960s and \u201970s, American Jews found urgency in the story of the Maccabees because of political affairs in Israel, Weissman Joselit said. Once again, some believed, Jews were an embattled minority in a strange land. Once again, their fate was unsure. Too, many Jews felt like an embattled minority in the United States. \u201cThere was a commitment in American Jewry writ large, based on the European experience, that a mixture of government and religion just never augured well for the Jews,\u201d said Marc Stern, a lawyer at the American Jewish Committee. \u201cThat mix was ideologically repugnant.\u201d \u201cThe religious events that have more significance\u2014you can\u2019t play around with them as easily.\u201d In the 1970s and \u201980s, these feelings contributed to a curious set of legal battles within the Jewish community. In 1973, the Chabad-Lebuvitch Rebbe Menachem M. Schneerson began a campaign: Help Jews across America light the menorah on Hanukkah. Religious law commands Jews to light the menorah on Hanukkah, preferably in public. In addition to distributing tin candleholders, the organization orchestrated and sponsored menorah lightings in American parks, city halls, and village greens\u2014on government-held land, in other words. By 1979, President Jimmy Carter was participating in a lighting ceremony. These public displays made many Jews uncomfortable. The Chabad campaign tested the \u201cbulk of the Jewish community\u2019s repudiation of the separation of church and state,\u201d Stern said. \u201cAs a tactic, it was thought that the best way to avoid Christian symbols\u2014with all their power, because they\u2019re the majority, they\u2019re the norm, and because in many places we weren\u2019t going to match them one-for-one\u2014[was] if we simply gave up on government and did our own thing.\u201d And always, there was that lingering fear of violence against the Jewish community. \u201cThere were still, 25, 30 years ago, Jews who believed: Keep your head down. Don\u2019t call attention to yourself. The menorah campaign was a challenge to that attitude,\u201d he said.\n\nWorking at the time with the American Jewish Congress, Stern was part of the team of litigators who submitted court briefs in opposition to Chabad\u2019s menorahs, including the 1989 Supreme Court case County of Allegheny v. ACLU. The case was a little bizarre. The Court considered two displays, one cr\u00e8che and one 18-foot menorah. Five years earlier, it had ruled in the case Lynch v. Donnelly that nativity scenes and other religious displays on government property were generally okay. In Allegheny, \u201cthe Court somehow ended up with the weirdest of all possible results,\u201d Stern said, \u201cwhich was that the menorah was okay, and this cr\u00e8che was not.\u201d The justices reasoned while the nativity scene displayed language designed primarily to promote religion, the menorah did not. In other words: Chabad won. Today, these giant menorahs are just a part of the American winter landscape. The White House menorah lighting is an annual tradition. No doubt, this public visibility has been one reason why Hanukkah has risen in prominence in American culture. But there\u2019s also an irony here. Chabad exists to help Jews engage with Jewish life, yet the holiday that Chabad most visibly promotes\u2014Hanukkah\u2014is one of the least liturgically important holidays of the year. \u201cChabad can\u2019t be doing things at the White House on Yom Kippur because they\u2019re in shul,\u201d Ashton said. \u201cThe religious events that have more significance and that are under more control by the clergy\u2014you can\u2019t play around with [them] as easily.\u201d As far as the options for Jewish gateway holiday go, Hannukah is a pretty poor choice. Some, like Chabad, explicitly intend for it to be a means of drawing Jews into observance, yet there\u2019s not much theological or ritual complexity to the celebration. For many Jews, it\u2019s fraught time of year, full of identity pissing contests that match plastic yard reindeers against giant light-up menorahs; as Ashton put it, \u201cThere\u2019s a lot about display in December.\u201d This public performance gives the holiday a distinct air of trying too hard: to compete with Christmas, to be colorful and loud, to demonstrate Jewishness, all without having to deal with Jewish theology, law, or morals. It has become a blue and white kaleidoscope of vague Jewishness, one that tacitly enables Christmas-style material excess.\n\n* * * tomertu / BrAt82 / E.J.Johnson Photography / Shutterstock / The Atlantic Any examination of Hanukkah\u2019s role in American Jewish life is inevitably self-parody. What more Jewish question could there be than Is this good for the Jews? But Judaism is a forward-looking religion; all its great dilemmas take place on an infinite Mount Nebo, one generation looking to the Promised Land and wondering what will become of the next. It\u2019s a little much to claim that Hanukkah hinders the continuation of the Jewish people. But this is a holiday that is all about children and their education, especially in America. For some Jews, Hanukkah is the only time of year when they engage with their heritage. Plaut, the congregational rabbi in New York who also wrote the book A Kosher Christmas, spent many years as a campus rabbi at the Hillels of MIT and Trinity College in Connecticut. In his experience, Hanukkah celebrations \u201cusually brought in non-religious students on campus to celebrate Hanukkah. That probably comes from what they experienced as children, growing up,\u201d he said. Where there\u2019s an event that might involve drinking and food, there are young people, and for rabbis, this presents a rare opportunity. \u201cIn the world we live in, you take people when they come to you, and you try and create the need for them constantly. Hanukkah is an easy, non-threatening way to do that,\u201d Plaut said. But what does Hanukkah really teach anyone about being Jewish? That Jews have boring games, cherry sufganiyot are disgusting, and singing bear dolls are obnoxious? Even \u201cthe miracle of the oil is more a legend than a reality,\u201d Plaut said. \u201cThe thinness of the theological basis\u2014in some ways, it makes it easier to reach out to the younger generations who might not want that religious depth initially,\u201d he said. \u201cHanukkah can be an easy way to celebrate one\u2019s Jewish identity without a lot of baggage.\u201d And it\u2019s true: Judaism, like any religion, comes with \u201cbaggage,\u201d whether a Jew grew up Reform, Conservative, Orthodox, or without any observance at all. Jewish identity is complicated even further in interfaith households, which are increasingly common. Doing both Hanukkah and Christmas can seem like a cultural compromise for parents feeling familial pressure, and precisely because of its simplicity, Hanukkah can seem like an easy entr\u00e9e into Judaism for kids.\n\nThat may be true, but unlike many Jewish holidays, Hanukkah doesn\u2019t reveal much of what Jewish life is about. It\u2019s an empty celebration, and in its lack of substance, it has become filled with literal stuff. \u201cNobody\u2019s buying anything for Yom Kippur \u2026 other than break-fast food and some bagels,\u201d said Neal Hoffman, a former Hasbro employee who invented Mensch on a Bench. This, if you haven\u2019t heard, is the Jewish alternative to Elf on a Shelf, first made in 2013 and now sold in places like Target and Bed Bath & Beyond. \u201cWe as Jews have not shown that we want to buy things for other holidays. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessarily bad, that we\u2019re keeping the other holidays a little more pure.\u201d The immaculate conception of Mensch on a Bench is, in many ways, the story of contemporary American Judaism. Hoffman is married to a Catholic; his two sons, Jacob and Alex, are being raised Jewish. Around Christmas time, his boys kept asking for trees and presents and the dreaded Elf on a Shelf. Hoffman would retort, \u201cJesus is the meal, Christmas is the dessert. And you can\u2019t have dessert if you don\u2019t have your dinner.\u201d But he didn\u2019t want to have to play defense against Christmas; he wanted his kids to have pride in their own cultural heritage. Thus, the Mensch\u2014a stuffed incarnation of the mythical, long-ago Jew who sat on a bench in the Temple and made sure the oil didn\u2019t burn down. In three years, Hoffman said, he has sold 120,000 dolls, and his company has started making books even for off-market holidays like Yom Kippur. \u201cThe truth is, we lose money on those,\u201d he said. \u201cWe as Jews have not shown that we want to buy things for other holidays. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessarily bad, that we\u2019re keeping the other holidays a little more pure. We\u2019re keeping Passover about Seder and keeping Yom Kippur about the fast.\u201d The word he used, pure, is telling\u2014even this Hanukkah pusher acknowledges that the Festival of Lights is a lesser holiday, fine to adulterate with endless products. It is a low-stakes, low-consequence celebration, and yet for a lot of American Jews, it has probably become one of the few times they encounter their religious culture during the year.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Cultural critics often blame Christmas for the Festival of Lights\u2019 commercialized kitsch.
