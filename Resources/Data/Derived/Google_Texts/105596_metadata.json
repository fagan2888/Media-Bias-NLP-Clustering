The 57-year-old East Dallas resident was shocked to find out that she had hepatitis C, a virus she had probably been infected with 30 years earlier through a blood transfusion she received during childbirth.\n\nShe\u2019s one of about 400,000 Texans infected with hepatitis C. The virus can lie dormant for years before causing symptoms and is the leading cause of liver cancer and liver transplants in the U.S. Treatment typically includes 48 weeks of injections and twice-daily pills that can cause serious side effects and don\u2019t always work.\n\nBut a new pill, approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration this month, actually cures hepatitis C. Sofosbuvir cured 89 percent of hepatitis C patients in only 12 weeks in clinical trials. Patients suffered fewer side effects than with older treatments and didn\u2019t have to endure weekly injections. But at $84,000 for a 12-week course, or $1,000 a pill, the cure doesn\u2019t come cheap.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a game changer,\u201d said Dr. William L. Lee, a liver disease specialist at UT Southwestern Medical Center. Lee has treated hundreds of patients using the older medications, interferon and ribavirin, and has had varied success.\n\n\u201cFor the past decade, we\u2019ve had patients on treatments that caused side effects like anemia and a low white cell count,\u201d he said. \u201cWe got some patients through it, but not many. Sofosbuvir has very few side effects. It\u2019s very exciting.\u201d\n\nMore than 3 million Americans are infected with hepatitis C. The virus is known as the silent killer because three quarters of those infected don\u2019t suffer symptoms for many years. More than 15,000 Americans die from the disease every year, surpassing the number that die from AIDS.\n\nCities like Dallas are home to higher concentrations of people living with hepatitis C.\n\n\u201cWe see more patients in metropolitan areas,\u201d said Dr. Parvez Mantry, a liver specialist at Methodist Dallas Medical Center. \u201cMost of them are baby boomers, born between 1945 and 1965.\u201d\n\nHepatitis C is spread through infected blood. Sharing needles and tattooing are common risk factors for transmission. But like Cazzaniga, many baby boomers may have become infected through blood transfusions and organ donations, which were not routinely part of hepatitis C screening before 1992.\n\nCazzaniga enrolled in a hepatitis C trial at Lee\u2019s clinic in May. She received one of two new drugs approved to treat the disease but won\u2019t find out which one until early next year. It\u2019s been two months since she finished taking the treatment, and there are no traces of the virus in her bloodstream. If the blood test is negative for hepatitis C next month, she\u2019ll be considered cured.\n\n\u201cI feel so much better,\u201d she said. \u201cEverybody says I look much better than I did. I feel free and very happy.\u201d\n\nMargaret Dudley was cured last month. The 62-year-old San Antonio native was infected with hepatitis C after getting permanent cosmetic tattooing at a spa in 2000. She tested positive in 2011 after feeling tired and depressed for months.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost like having a cheesecloth over your brain,\u201d she said.\n\nDudley enrolled in a clinical trial and was treated with sofosbuvir and another drug, ledipasvir, which hasn\u2019t been approved yet.\n\n\u201cMy viral load went down the first week,\u201d she said. \u201cI could really feel the difference once I was on the medication.\u201d\n\nAbout 20 new medications are in various stages of development. But the cost of the new pills clouds the good news of a long-awaited hepatitis C cure. Olysio, made by Janssen Therapeutics, was approved in November and costs $60,000 per patient.\n\n\u201cCost is a big barrier,\u201d Lee said. The new treatments cost about four times more than the current drugs. Patient assistance programs offered by the pharmaceutical companies provide help to some who need assistance with the cost of medications.\n\nBut Lee worries that many patients will rely on Medicaid and that the state\u2019s Medicaid program won\u2019t fund the treatment.\n\n\u201cWe have plenty of patients in Texas with hepatitis C,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the fact that [Gov.] Rick Perry has turned down Affordable Care Act funding raises red flags about access to these treatments.\u201d\n\nCazzaniga is one of the lucky ones. She doesn\u2019t have health insurance and wouldn\u2019t have had access to this breakthrough if she hadn\u2019t been enrolled in a clinical trial.\n\nThe cost of the drugs may drop as newer hepatitis C medications reach the marketplace, but that will take time, said Dr. Raymond Schinazi, professor of pediatrics at Emory University, who oversaw the development of sofosbuvir. (The drug, whose trade name is Sovaldi, will be manufactured by Gilead Sciences.)\n\nUntil that happens, insurance companies may have to prioritize patients and offer the new treatments to those who have already progressed to severe liver damage.\n\nApproximately 30 percent of people infected with hepatitis C will not suffer serious liver damage. They may not have entertained the idea of weeks of injections, but they might be tempted by the convenience of the new pills \u2014 and the promise of an easier cure. Whether insurance companies will cover the cost of treating this group remains to be seen.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an ethical and moral obligation to treat and cure patients,\u201d Schinazi said.\n\nHe argues that treating everyone with hepatitis C lowers the risk of transmitting the virus and takes us one step closer to eradicating it for good.\n\n\u201cBut until the price comes down, insurance companies may have to treat the people with severe liver damage first,\u201d he said.\n\nDudley believes that no one should have to wait to be cured.\n\n\u201cThe drugs are out there, and I\u2019m proof that they work,\u201d she said. \u201cThe price of the pills shouldn\u2019t stand in the way of anyone\u2019s health.\u201d\n\nDr. Seema Yasmin, who served as a disease detective at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is a fellow in global journalism at the University of Toronto\u2019s Munk School of Global Affairs.
