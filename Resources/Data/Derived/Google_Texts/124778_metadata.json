(AP) - Five weeks ago, an Amtrak inspection train rolled across South Mississippi for the first time since Hurricane Katrina.\n\nOn Wednesday, officials met in Biloxi to move forward plans of restoring passenger rail service across the Gulf Coast, The Sun Herald (http://bit.ly/1Uc0OQn) reported.\n\nOfficials from CSX, U.S. Sen. Roger Wicker\u2019s office, the Federal Railway Administration and the states and cities met to get a report concerning the project to Congress by the Sept. 4 deadline.\n\nMark Murphy, general manager of long distance service for Amtrak, said lawmakers want to see a preferred route, what infrastructure and repairs are needed to operate, the cost of restoring train service and funding sources.\n\nThe group suggested a daily round-trip train from New Orleans through south Mississippi to Mobile, Alabama, and a long-distance train that would connect from New Orleans to Orlando, Florida, through Jacksonville.\n\n\u201cWe have to figure it out. There\u2019s an aggressive timeline to do this,\u201d Murphy said. He said the group will continue to meet every month to put together a plan.\n\nMurphy added that the project has the potential to open the community to a tourist market.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Sun Herald, http://www.sunherald.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Five weeks ago, an Amtrak inspection train rolled across South Mississippi for the first time since Hurricane Katrina.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/24/amtrak-on-track-to-return-to-gulf-coast/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "Five weeks ago, an Amtrak inspection train rolled across South Mississippi for the first time since Hurricane Katrina.", "title": "Amtrak passenger service on track to return to Gulf Coast"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "description": "Five weeks ago, an Amtrak inspection train rolled across South Mississippi for the first time since Hurricane Katrina.", "card": "summary", "title": "Amtrak passenger service on track to return to Gulf Coast"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "(AP) - Five weeks ago, an Amtrak inspection train rolled across South Mississippi for the first time since Hurricane Katrina.\nOn Wednesday, officials met in Biloxi to move forward plans of restoring passenger rail service across the Gulf Coast, The Sun Herald (http://bit.ly/1Uc0OQn) reported.\nMark Murphy, general manager of long distance service for Amtrak, said lawmakers want to see a preferred route, what infrastructure and repairs are needed to operate, the cost of restoring train service and funding sources.\nThe group suggested a daily round-trip train from New Orleans through south Mississippi to Mobile, Alabama, and a long-distance train that would connect from New Orleans to Orlando, Florida, through Jacksonville.\nMurphy added that the project has the potential to open the community to a tourist market."}
