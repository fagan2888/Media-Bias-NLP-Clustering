Off the field, he\u2019s known for his love of others, devout faith, and now, his decision to abstain from sex until marriage.\n\nWilson has been a weekly visitor to the Seattle Children\u2019s Hospital, visiting so frequently that the hospital has designated \u201cBlue Tuesdays\u201d for Wilson\u2019s scheduled appearances. Even when travelling, he manages to drop in and brighten up a few children\u2019s days.\n\nAmazing time at San Diego\u2019s Children\u2019s Hospital @radychildrens today with @bwalt19 & this lovely girl! pic.twitter.com/oMBmq2A9K1 \u2014 Russell Wilson (@DangeRussWilson) July 8, 2015\n\nThe starting quarterback is also a Christian, and continues to be outspoken about his faith.\n\nGrateful for God\u2019s Love! He is simply more than enough! #PeacefulHeart \u2014 Russell Wilson (@DangeRussWilson) July 5, 2015\n\nWilson has gained national attention recently after speaking at a church service and sharing with the congregation that he and his popstar girlfriend, Ciara, are staying abstinent until marriage.\n\n\u201cI knew that God had brought me into her life to bless her and for her to bless me, and to bless so many people with the impact that she has, that I have,\u201d Wilson told the The Rock Church in San Diego. \u201cNobody\u2019s perfect, but He\u2019s anointed us to do something miraculous, something special.\u201d\n\n\u201cI ain\u2019t gonna lie to y\u2019all now,\u201d Wilson continued, \u201cI need y\u2019all to pray for us. \u2018Cause I know y\u2019all seen her on the screen now. If there\u2019s a 10, she\u2019s a 15.\u201d\n\nMany people took to Twitter to show their support, voice their disgust and throw a few football puns in the mix as well. Some fans praised Wilson for not only speaking about his faith, but showing his efforts to practice it as well.\n\nThank you @DangeRussWilson for standing up for purity and the art of respecting God\u2019s design for marriage. \u2014 Jarrid Wilson (@JarridWilson) July 8, 2015\n\nGained a lot more respect for Russell Wilson today. The fact that he stands by his faith in the environment he\u2019s in is pretty awesome. \u2014 Young King (@JoshDMiller_) July 7, 2015\n\nOthers touted Wilson as a much-needed deserving role model in the NFL.\n\nI hope Russell Wilson continues chastity and a successful marriage so teens have another positive role model to look up to. \u2014 Fr Matthew Schneider (@FrMatthewLC) July 7, 2015\n\nRussell Wilson is setting the bar high out here! \u2014 Jonica Booth (@Blu1x) July 7, 2015\n\nA few took the information in a lighthearted manner to taunt Wilson on his infamous picked off pass in last year\u2019s Super Bowl.\n\nAs a #Seahawks fan, after that Super Bowl debacle, I\u2019m pretty sure Russell Wilson should be thinking about scoring MORE, not less. \u2014 Rob Lowe (@RobLowe) July 7, 2015\n\nI hope no one drafts Russell Wilson in fantasy football. Clearly he\u2019s afraid of getting to the end zone. \u2014 Jason (@PeroEsPapiJason) July 6, 2015\n\nA more serious approach was taken by some fans who wanted to comment in light of current events.\n\nNo suprise that same ESPN pundits that celebrated Michael Sam\u2019s \u201ccoming out\u201d are scoffing at Russell Wilson\u2019s statement about abstinence. \u2014 Justin Kirksey (@JustinKirksey) July 8, 2015\n\nSo you guys praise Bruce Jenner but ridicule Russell Wilson ? Because that makes complete sense ???? \u2014 ??arcus Senpai (@sirmarcus__) July 6, 2015\n\nYou know society is twisted when Russell Wilson is getting slandered for building the foundation of his relationship on his belief system \u2014 Arachnid O (@OkeraJ) July 6, 2015\n\nThe debate even permeated ESPN as two of their commentators clashed over social media regarding the issue.\n\n(1 of 2) @bomani_jones on @HQonESPN regarding Russell/Ciara u implied people trying 2 do it Jesus\u2019 way by waiting till marriage r stupid. \u2014 Chris Broussard (@Chris_Broussard) July 7, 2015\n\ni believe the underlying premise is flawed and about controlling women as much as anything else. so yes. https://t.co/DUyjVgmoAm \u2014 Bomani Jones (@bomani_jones) July 7, 2015\n\nWhile Wilson hasn\u2019t commented on the array of responses directly, he did continue to share the message he holds dear.", "article_metadata": {"description": "He's waiting until marriage.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "He's waiting until marriage.", "title": "12 Tweets About Quarterback Russell Wilson's Sex Decision", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150708_RussellWilson.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-07-08T18:30:22+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1LWPD9Q"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "He's waiting until marriage.", "title": "12 Tweets About Quarterback Russell Wilson's Sex Decision", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150708_RussellWilson.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "Marriage & Family", "published_time": "2015-07-08T17:30:29+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-08T18:30:22+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Russell Wilson, Seahawks, Ciara, abstinence, chastity"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc510\"", "article_summary": "pic.twitter.com/oMBmq2A9K1 \u2014 Russell Wilson (@DangeRussWilson) July 8, 2015The starting quarterback is also a Christian, and continues to be outspoken about his faith.\nSeattle Seahawks Quarterback Russell Wilson is known on the field as a short but tenacious player who has already broken multiple NFL records.\nAs a #Seahawks fan, after that Super Bowl debacle, I\u2019m pretty sure Russell Wilson should be thinking about scoring MORE, not less.\n\u2014 Jarrid Wilson (@JarridWilson) July 8, 2015Gained a lot more respect for Russell Wilson today.\n\u2014 Rob Lowe (@RobLowe) July 7, 2015I hope no one drafts Russell Wilson in fantasy football."}
