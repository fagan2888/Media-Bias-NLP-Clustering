BIRMINGHAM, Alabama -- A crowd of a few hundred people by 4 p.m. had gathered at Railroad Park in downtown Birmingham to hear a free jazz concert and enjoy the sunny fall weather.

Magic City Smooth Jazz teamed with Birmingham City Councilor Johnathan Austin's District Five Fun Day at Railroad Park for the concert and festivities running from 4 to 7 p.m.

"I love it," said Stephen Hundley, a 22-year-old drummer from Trussville, waiting to get on stage to perform. "This is an excellent environment here."

Performing at the concert are the RAW Jazz Trio featuring Anita Besong and Down to the Bone.

Many brought lawn chairs to set up on the wide grass area in front of the stage while aromas created by nearby barbecues stirred appetites. Food vendors and entertainment including bounce-houses for children were available.

Various public service agencies set up tables to disseminate information to visitors. Enroll Alabama, an affiliate of AIDS Alabama, attended to help people understand the health insurance marketplace under President Obama's Affordable Care Act.

"We're setting up appointments," said Lauren Banks, director of policy and advocacy for AIDS Alabama. "We will be getting information and setting up appointments to help them. And it's free."

Railroad Park visitors during the festivities can also get the chance to win prizes provided throughout the evening.
