(AP) \u2014 When Smith heard that Florida judges had lifted the state\u2019s ban on same-sex marriage last month, he set out to throw an over the top-wedding officiated by chef Guy Fieri, with a stunning cake from Duff Goldman, and a dance party spun by local star Chi Chi LaRue. He invited the first 101 couples to participate in the free wedding, noting he chose the number after the movie \u201c101 Dalmatians\u201d to shame Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, who has ardently fought to keep same-sex marriage from becoming legal.\n\n\u201cWe have our own Cruella De Vil, Pam Bondi. She was determined that she was going to prevent equality from coming to Florida,\u201d Smith said.\n\n\u201cFor a state known for sunshine, it was living in the darkness when it came to LGBT rights and it was important to acknowledge that.\u201d\n\nSouth Beach is also memorable to Smith who met his partner, Jesus Salgueiro, here 15 years ago while in town with Winfrey. Smith went out to buy some flowers for her home. He returned with the flowers and Salgueiro, whom he married five years ago on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial with a big \u2018ole ceremony where Moby performed.\n\nNicole Griffin, 43, and Stephanie Swanson, 42, had been waiting a few years to say \u2018I do.\u2019 The Tampa couple moved from Indiana shortly before gay marriage became legal there. Friends flew in from California and Indianapolis to see the women, both wearing elegant white gowns, get married Saturday.\n\n\u201c(Pam Bondi) fought so hard. She denied us for so long \u2026 I think our presence today and being able to do this is a defeat of that mentality,\u201d Swanson said.\n\nBondi is appealing the rulings and some county officials in more conservative areas have even stopped performing marriage ceremonies.\n\nSeth Anderson and his partner Michael Ferguson, both 33, flew out from Utah to renew their vows. They were among the first to legally marry there two years ago, but none of their family or friends were able to attend the impromptu ceremony at the courthouse where the couple had nothing to wear but their work clothes.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Chef Art Smith hosts mass gay wedding on Miami Beach", "title": "Chef Art Smith hosts mass gay wedding on Miami Beach", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Chef Art Smith hosts mass gay wedding on Miami Beach", "title": "Chef Art Smith hosts mass gay wedding on Miami Beach", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/02/22/chef_art_smith_hosts_mass_gay_wedding_on_miami_beach/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/02/celebrity-chef-gay-weddings.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Chef Art Smith hosts mass gay wedding on Miami Beach", "title": "Chef Art Smith hosts mass gay wedding on Miami Beach", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/02/celebrity-chef-gay-weddings.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Kelli Kennedy", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb2ed\"", "article_summary": "She was determined that she was going to prevent equality from coming to Florida,\u201d Smith said.\n\u201cWe have our own Cruella De Vil, Pam Bondi.\n\u201c(Pam Bondi) fought so hard.\nBondi is appealing the rulings and some county officials in more conservative areas have even stopped performing marriage ceremonies.\nSeth Anderson and his partner Michael Ferguson, both 33, flew out from Utah to renew their vows."}
