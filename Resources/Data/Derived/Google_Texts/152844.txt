Robert Ascroft Orlando Bloom and Condola Rashad as Romeo and Juliet.

Despite all the buzz about the casting, David Leveaux, director of the latest production of Romeo and Juliet to hit Broadway, says the play’s most radical aspect is its exploration of family dynamics. Pia Catton and WSJ This Morning’s Gordon Deal discuss this new interpretation of Romeo & Juliet.

In her article on the play, Raising ‘Romeo’ Above Its Stars, which appeared in Thursday’s paper, Ms. Catton writes:

The buzz around “Romeo and Juliet,” opening Thursday on Broadway, is all about the casting of its movie-star Romeo, Orlando Bloom, and Condola Rashad, who is African American, as Juliet. The director, David Leveaux, is prepared for the fans of Legolas (the elven hero Mr. Bloom portrayed in “The Lord of the Rings” trilogy), but he thinks they will appreciate what Shakespeare’s play, in his view, is really about: clueless parents. “For people who think of the play as just about this love story, one of the surprising, radical things is what it has to show you about family dynamics,” said Mr. Leveaux. “This is a play in which there is a cavernous gap between parents and their children. The children are almost strangers to their parents.”
