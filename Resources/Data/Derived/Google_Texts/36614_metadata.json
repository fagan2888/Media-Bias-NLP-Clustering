The activity under DeRyckere's alias on the site is what ultimately led to a state investigation.\n\nAccording the case agent, DeRyckere also had accounts on ourteennetwork.com and Kik, an instant messaging app for cell phones.\n\nCourt records show DeRyckere sent messages to users asking, \"Got any pics of young nude girls? Like 10-15? ;).\" He also asked for users to \"Only send them if they're young ;) like idc if they're 10 hehe.\"", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "A 26-year-old Shawnee resident is facing child pornography charges.", "author": "Lisa Monahan", "og": {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/26692840/shawnee-man-arrested-on-child-porn-charges", "image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/4973117_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A 26-year-old Shawnee resident is facing child pornography charges.", "title": "Shawnee Man Arrested On Child Porn Charges"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/4973117_G.jpg", "description": "A 26-year-old Shawnee resident is facing child pornography charges.", "card": "summary", "title": "Shawnee Man Arrested On Child Porn Charges"}, "wnreadableurl": "shawnee-man-arrested-on-child-porn-charges", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "owner": "KWTV", "fb": {"app_id": 538140636230283}, "date": "2014/10/02", "KEYWORDS": "oklahoma city,okc,media, crime, child, pornography, Shane DeRyckere, Shawnee, social media, news 9, news9.com, kwtv", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS05", "verify-v1": "d5ZN+GNiazjgWlnr3WHikwraMvFljdUSLMgex4CGnc8=", "news_keywords": "oklahoma city,okc,media, crime, child, pornography, Shane DeRyckere, Shawnee, social media, news 9, news9.com, kwtv"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc1aa\"", "article_summary": "He also asked for users to \"Only send them if they're young ;) like idc if they're 10 hehe.\"\nCourt records show DeRyckere sent messages to users asking, \"Got any pics of young nude girls?\nAuthorities accuse Shane DeRyckere of using social media to get nude photographs of girls under the age of 16.\nExperts in internet crime said what DeRyckere is believed to have done is common among child predators, using social media sites that are frequented by their targets and often posing as someone they're not.\n\"They will pose as anything in order to get people to send them pictures,\" Tanner said."}
