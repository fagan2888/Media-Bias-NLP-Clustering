LAKE LUZERNE, N.Y. — A teenage river guide was killed when a bus with 34 people aboard overturned en route to an excursion in New York's Adirondack Mountains, police said tonight.

The 15-year-old victim was thrown from the bus and died at the scene in Lake Luzerne, southwest of Lake George, at about 12:30 p.m. today, New York State Police said.

They did not identify or provide further details about the victim. Another person was hospitalized with an ankle injury.

State police say the modified school bus may have had mechanical problems. An investigation is continuing.

No one answered the phone at bus owner Tubby Tubes Rafting Company’s offices. A recording says all of the company's activities are shut down Sunday "due to unforeseen circumstances."
