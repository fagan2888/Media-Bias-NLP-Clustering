Why are you running for the U.S. House of Representatives?\n\nRepresenting a district that is home to the state\u2019s key infrastructure, harbors, airports and military installations on the Honolulu City Council and at the Hawaii state Legislature has prepared me to serve us in Congress. The future of our state\u2019s economy, security, and sustainability are dependent on the modernization of our harbors, airports, and military. I believe leadership is service, and I see government as a way to help people.\n\nWhat Hawaii needs in Congress is someone who has a proven track record of creating jobs and economic opportunities that will sustain our quality of life and move us forward as a state. In the near term, I believe we can achieve this goal\u2026", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Civil Beat News", "description": "Editor\u2019s note:\u00a0For Hawaii\u2019s Aug. 9 primary, Civil Beat asked candidates to answer some questions.
