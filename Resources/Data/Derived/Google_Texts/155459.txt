The Narrative Matters section of Health Affairs is seeking personal essay submissions on the theme of Food and Health.

The journal’s November 2015 issue will present work that explores the relationship between the food we consume and our wellbeing on the individual, societal, and global levels. Articles will address causes and consequences of dietary excess and insufficiency, analyze policies and programs aimed at influencing these, and explore the roles of public policy, industry, and stakeholder groups in the context of dietary behavior.

While the submission deadline for traditional research manuscripts has passed, the Narrative Matters section of the journal is still accepting essay submissions on this topic, with the goal of selecting one for publication in the November issue.

Remember, Narrative Matters features personal stories about experiences with the health care system and the people in it, using the power of literary nonfiction to highlight an important public policy issue. We’re interested in well-written policy narratives, told as first-person stories.

If you have a policy narrative on the topic of food and health that you’d like us to consider for publication in the theme issue, please send them our way. Please review our submission guidelines for more information. Essays must be submitted by August 1 to be considered for the November issue.
