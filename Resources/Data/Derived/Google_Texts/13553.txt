Seeking a power arm for their bullpen, the Rockies signed former Milwaukee Brewers and Cleveland Indians closer John Axford to a minor-league contract. The right-hander will get an invitation to spring training.

Axford’s deal guarantees him a $2.6 million base salary if he makes the major-league roster, and he can make an additional $1.5 million in incentives.

Axford, 31, posted 10 saves for the Indians last season. He began the season as the Indians’ closer, but struggled with command and lost his job to Cody Allen in early May. Axford was traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates after an August waiver claim.

Axford finished the 2014 season 2-4 with a 3.95 ERA. A hard thrower — his fastball averaged 94.7 mph last season, according to FanGraphs — he struck out 10.4 batters per nine innings. But he also had control problems, walking 5.9 batters per nine innings.

Axford saved 46 games for the Brewers in 2011 and 35 in 2012. Axford has a career 3.40 ERA and 116 saves in six big-league seasons with the Brewers, Cardinals, Indians and Pirates.

In signing Axford, the Rockies continue their philosophy of seeking pitchers who can induce groundballs. Axford had a 53.6 percent groundball ratio in 2014.

Last week, the Rockies agreed to contract terms with one-time closer Rafael Betancourt. Betancourt, 39, saved 57 games for the Rockies from 2009-13. He was acquired in a trade in 2009.

In 2013, Betancourt suffered a right elbow injury that required Tommy John surgery. He didn’t pitch in the majors last season, but made 21 appearances in the minors, going 2-0 with a 4.66 ERA after he returned from surgery and built up arm strength.
