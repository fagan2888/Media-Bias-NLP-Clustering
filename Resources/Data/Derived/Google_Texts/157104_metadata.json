In one passage, Lut says, \u201cDo you approach the males from all mankind and leave the wives that your Lord created for you? No, you are a transgressing people\u2026 I am a detester of your deed. Lord, save me and my family from what they do.\u201d God does save them and declares, \u201cWe destroyed the others. And we loosed on them a rain. Wretched is the rain of those forewarned!\u201d (26:165-173).\n\nThe Quran doesn\u2019t address lesbianism except by inference (unlike the Christian New Testament in Romans 1:26). However, an authoritative Hadith collection contains this edict from Muhammad: \u201cA man should not see the private parts of another man, and a woman should not see the private parts of another woman, and a man should not lie with another man under one covering, and a woman should not lie with another woman under one covering\u201d (Sahih Muslim 3:667).\n\n\n\nSmall numbers of U.S. Muslims may openly disagree, but opposition is unanimous in Muslim fiqh (jurisprudence). The consensus is defined in a ruling by the chairman of the Fiqh Council of North America, Muzammil Siddiqi, a Saudi-trained Harvard Ph.D. He deems homosexuality a violation of God\u2019s law that is \u201charam\u201d (forbidden), an \u201cabnormality,\u201d \u201csinful,\u201d \u201cshameful,\u201d \u201cevil,\u201d \u201catrocious,\u201d \u201cobscene\u201d and \u201can assault on the humanity of a person\u201d that causes \u201cdestruction of the family.\u201d\n\nSiddiqi also states that \u201cthose who insist on this lifestyle, consider it legitimate and feel \u2018gay pride,\u2019 we should not associate with them and should not take them as friends. We should certainly avoid these people.\u201d Few Christian or Jewish traditionalists go that far.", "article_metadata": {"description": "America\u2019s two dominant religious blocs, conservative Protestantism and the \r\nCatholic Church, face increasing hostility over their longstanding \r\nopposition to same-sex behavior and marriages, shared with Eastern \r\nOrthodoxy, the Latter-day Saints (\u201cMormons\u201d), Jewish traditionalists, and \r\nother faiths.\r\n\r\nMainstream news media have largely ignored that U.S. Islam agrees.
