(AP) - Research papers can contain quite a bit of complicated and academic language. Danielle Dixson knows that.\n\nBut the assistant professor at the University of Delaware\u2019s Lewes campus wants to have her research be more accessible to the masses.\n\nTo do so, she takes her papers and makes children\u2019s books out of them.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great that we know more information or we found a study or found something interesting,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it needs to be communicated to more than just people who read scientific papers, which is not the majority of people.\u201d\n\nDixson, who joined UD in June, started writing children\u2019s books while she was doing post-doctorate work in Fiji in 2012. It was her way of communicating with locals there about her work, in addition to making videos for adults.\n\nThe books were well received, she said.\n\n\u201cEven though the Fijians are very tied to the ocean, they don\u2019t have a huge (amount of) marine education in their education system,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of the stuff I was doing was trying to help with that and get them more engaged in what I was doing.\u201d\n\nAt her lab, Dixson and her team research marine conservation and how animals act when their sensory systems are affected by changing conditions in the ocean.\n\nIn the spring, she plans on teaching an introduction to biological oceanography course, while developing a marine conservation course and potentially a marine animal behavior course.\n\nIt\u2019s a topic Dixson has researched for eight years and hopes can get more attention.\n\n\u201cAnimal behavior has been not incorporated in a lot of the conservation initiatives as much as it could be or should be,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it\u2019s important that we can get information on how changing conditions will affect behavior and how the behavior may cascade into other areas.\u201d\n\nSubject matter for her seven books include sharks, ocean acidification and the importance of plants being planted along the coastline so fish can find homes. The books are designed for ages 4 to 8.\n\nNot only does she create children\u2019s books for her own papers, Dixson has had her students design books based on their own work.\n\n\u201cThat helps them communicate with the general public and they get a much better understanding of their own research,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have to really understand something to make it at a level a 7-year-old can understand.\u201d\n\nAt UD, she hopes to collaborate with the school\u2019s education and English departments, along with graphic designers, to refine the books and publish them.\n\n\u201cThe more the kids understand about what\u2019s happening, the more they can make changes in their own lives or make it a priority for them,\u201d she said.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Daily Times of Salisbury, Md., http://www.delmarvanow.com/", "article_metadata": {"description": "Research papers can contain quite a bit of complicated and academic language.
