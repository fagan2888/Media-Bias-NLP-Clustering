John Kasich\u2019s first ad in the crucial presidential primary state of New Hampshire opens with the little-known candidate emerging calmly from a cacophony of shrill voices and grainy pictures of his competitors, and then he promises to \u201clook out for other people.\u201d\n\nThe tone, and the $5 million spent at a time when few other candidates are airing ads, proved timely in reaching voters seeking an antidote to the angry and outsized personal politics of Republican front-runner Donald Trump. And it has helped Kasich become a surprising factor in the nation\u2019s first primary in New Hampshire, further complicating efforts by former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush to win a clean sweep of the state's large group of establishment and moderate Republicans.\n\nLike the rest of the field, Kasich has been overshadowed by Trump\u2019s mega-moment. But he is having a moment of his own, solidifying key endorsements and rising to second place behind Trump in the latest poll of New Hampshire Republican primary voters drawn to his blunt style -- which he frequently reminds audiences about.\n\nDuring numerous town hall meetings in New Hampshire, he has employed the language of morality and purpose to describe his political beliefs, recalling the evangelical author and pastor Rick Warren, with echoes of George W. Bush\u2019s \u201ccompassionate conservatism.\u201d\n\n\u201cSomebody told me the other day, \u2018Well, I\u2019m a conservative, but I have a big heart,\u2019\u201d Kasich said during a phone interview this week amid a California fundraising trip. \u201cI said, \u2018Why don\u2019t we change the way you say that?\u2019\u201d\n\nKasich is using one quality he shares with Trump -- a sense of unpredictability -- in an attempt to stand out.\n\nHis main talking point is that he has no talking points, something he said twice in five minutes during a recent exchange with reporters.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re whatever comes into my head, OK?\u201d he said of his comments on the campaign trail.\n\nA minute later, Kasich delivered a winding monologue about the cruelty of extremist group Islamic State and his shock that Americans have tried to join it \u201cbecause some of them have lost meaning in their life and they\u2019re searching for it desperately.\u201d\n\nThe talk of Islamic State and the battle of ideas went on before Kasich interrupted himself to make another point -- about Kasich himself and the fact that his campaign is atypical.\n\n\u201cHaven\u2019t you figured that out?\u201d he said, arguing with no one in particular.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not like stuck anywhere. I don\u2019t have a teleprompter. I don\u2019t have talking points. I mean I study issues. People used to say, \u2018Well, you know, he\u2019s undisciplined.\u2019 Do you think I have been? ... I\u2019m having a ball.\u201d\n\nAnd so it went.\n\nCharles F. Bass, a former New Hampshire congressman who has not endorsed a candidate, said Kasich has surprised him by drawing interest from the type of hard-to-reach voters who do not usually pay close attention at this stage of the race. \u201cThe ads were good,\u201d Bass said. \u201cWhen you have a huge crowd of people in a primary, television advertising is very effective, particularly when no one else is doing it.\u201d\n\nMany political observers believe Bush has the most to lose from Kasich\u2019s rise.\n\n\u201cThey cut similar profiles in terms of record and tone,\u201d said Fergus Cullen, a former state party chairman who has not endorsed anyone. \u201cKasich is a current governor, not a governor from a decade ago, and Kasich has a new last name and not a name that people are already familiar with.\u201d\n\nPeter Taylor, a retired facilities manager who attended a recent town hall with Kasich at an Elks Lodge in Salem, N.H., that drew about 100 people, said he liked Bush. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think Jeb can get elected.\u201d\n\nKasich, he said, \u201cis the one, definitely.\u201d\n\nKasich offers a conservative message that predates the tea party movement: He\u2019d like to shrink government and do away with regulations, including some of the Wall Street rules enacted after the financial crisis. But he does not want to eliminate the federal government altogether. Kasich worked as an executive at Lehman Brothers from 2001 until the 2008 collapse of the firm, an event that helped jump-start the economic crisis. That experience could cause him political problems if he comes closer to winning the nomination.\n\nHis philosophy plays better in New Hampshire than in states with more conservative Republican voting bases. Kasich accepted federal money to expand Medicaid in his state as part of the Affordable Care Act, infuriating the law\u2019s opponents. He supports the Common Core education standards that have become wildly unpopular with many core Republicans. And he has resisted harsh immigration rhetoric, while embracing a plan to provide legal status for people in this country illegally.\n\nKasich bristled in an interview at the moderate label, recounting efforts to cut taxes in his state, deregulate the federal government, and -- during his 18 years in Congress -- to balance the budget during the Clinton administration.\n\n\u201cWhat is it I don\u2019t understand that isn\u2019t conservative about that?\u201d he said. \u201cAs I\u2019m telling people, I want practical solutions based on conservative principles.\u201d\n\nHis long record has made it difficult for him to bend to meet the changing mores of his party. On immigration, for example, he has already changed positions over the years, making another shift politically difficult.\n\nHe once opposed a legal path for immigrants in the country illegally and supported revoking automatic citizenship for children born to them. In recent years he has recanted those positions.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m trying to promote is something that\u2019s realistic and doable,\u201d he said.\n\nOn other issues, including abortion, he is fairly conservative. But it\u2019s his tone and style that sets him apart. In an era of government shutdowns, he is talking about himself as a compromiser. During his town hall meeting at the Elks Club, he mentioned \u201cGary Hart, Democrat, one of the smartest people I ever worked with\u201d in describing his efforts to reorganize the Department of Defense in the 1980s.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "John Kasich might have a little Donald Trump in him, and he's a threat to Jeb Bush", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "Ohio Gov.
