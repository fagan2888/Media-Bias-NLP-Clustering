How many articles has National Review published in which manly man conservative writers pronounce their revulsion at the idea of a pajama-clad and rather slender young man preparing to sip some hot cocoa and discuss Affordable Care Act coverage options with his mom over the holidays? Well here's one from Jonah Goldberg, and another one from Charles Cooke, and yet a third from Michael Walsh.



So you're thinking to yourselfâ€”three? How can they get by with only three takes on this issue?

See the answer is that National Review Editor Rich Lowry saved the definitive National Review conservadude take on Pajama Boy for an opinion piece published in Politico magazine. The need to bring his particular take on it (OK, well, like the other three National Review writers he sees Pajama Boy as an emblem of the failures of the contemporary left) to the broader Politico audience explains the relatively scanty coverage in NR proper.

At any rate, this is why National Review remains the flagship journal of the American right. The Weekly Standard limited itself to only a single article on the subject of Pajama Boy, though it did come up with the novel take that Pajama Boy is at odds with traditional notions of masculinity and this is both terrible and emblematic of the larger failings of the contemporary American left.
