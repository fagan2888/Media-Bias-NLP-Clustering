In the last week alone, in seven separate incidents, border patrols intercepted 121 Cuban refugees.\n\nAll were summarily returned to Cuban authorities, as were the 481 refugees intercepted just in the month of December\u2014a 117 percent increase since last year, according to the Coast Guard.\n\nOn Dec. 17, President Obama announced his administration had reached a deal with the Cuban government, ending a decades-long embargo and renewing diplomatic relations.\n\nSeeking to \u201cextend a hand of friendship,\u201d the president declared that \u201cthe United States of America is changing its relationship with the people of Cuba.\u201d\n\nCoast Guard Rear Adm. Jake Korn said the president\u2019s action does little to change standing immigration policy. Congressional approval is still required, he explained.\n\n\u201cThe administration\u2019s recent announcement regarding Cuba does not affect immigration policies, including wet foot/dry foot or the Cuban Adjustment Act\u2014which only Congress can change,\u201d Korn said.\n\nUntil that happens, Korn said, the Coast Guard will continue to \u201caggressively patrol the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico.\u201d\n\nHistorically, Cuban escape attempts have not been uncommon.\n\nIn 1995, President Bill Clinton amended the 1966 Cuban Adjustment Act. The subsequent \u201cwet foot/dry foot\u201d policy allows Cuban refugees who reach American shores to remain while returning those intercepted at sea.\n\nSince then, thousands of Cubans have attempted to reach the Florida coasts in various homemade vessels including rafts, homemade boats and cars converted into sailing vessels.", "article_metadata": {"description": "As Washington renews diplomatic ties with Havana, hundreds of Cuban refugees continue to flee the Castro regime for America.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "As Washington renews diplomatic ties with Havana, hundreds of Cuban refugees continue to flee the Castro regime for America.", "title": "Coast Guard Sees 117% Increase in Cuban Escape Attempts", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/krtphotos079382.jpg", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1HNZFVY"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "As Washington renews diplomatic ties with Havana, hundreds of Cuban refugees continue to flee the Castro regime for America.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/krtphotos079382.jpg"}, "title": "Coast Guard Sees 117% Increase in Cuban Escape Attempts", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "International", "tag": "latin america", "published_time": "2015-01-07T13:29:42+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Coast Guard, Cuba, Boat People, Obama, Embassy, Wegmann"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd07a0\"", "article_summary": "On Monday the U.S. Coast Guard announced a surge of Cuban immigration attempts.\nUntil that happens, Korn said, the Coast Guard will continue to \u201caggressively patrol the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico.\u201dHistorically, Cuban escape attempts have not been uncommon.\nAll were summarily returned to Cuban authorities, as were the 481 refugees intercepted just in the month of December\u2014a 117 percent increase since last year, according to the Coast Guard.\nIn the last week alone, in seven separate incidents, border patrols intercepted 121 Cuban refugees.\nThe subsequent \u201cwet foot/dry foot\u201d policy allows Cuban refugees who reach American shores to remain while returning those intercepted at sea."}
