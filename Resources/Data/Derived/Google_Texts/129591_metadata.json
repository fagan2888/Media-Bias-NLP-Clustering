It comes from small businesses across the United States,\u201d Cruz said at the Texas Republican Party convention in Dallas-Fort Worth. \u201cWhen you get the boot of government off small businesses, jobs and economic growth take off.\u201d\n\nCruz acknowledge being \u201cdisappointed\u201d about having to suspend his campaign, after Trump\u2019s commanding May 3 primary win in Indiana. However, he appeared unwavering in his beliefs, also calling for the repeal of ObamaCare, as he has done in Congress and did on the campaign trail.\n\nCruz has left open the small possibility that he might return to the race, saying Tuesday morning before the Nebraska primary that he had no path to victory but that his campaign would \u201crespond accordingly\u201d if \u201cthat changes.\u201d\n\nHowever, by late afternoon, upon returning to his Senate office and talking to reporters, Cruz sounded more resigned to making his voice heard on Capitol Hill.\n\nOnce friendly, Cruz and Trump clashed bitterly before Cruz suspended his campaign. He hasn't since endorsed Trump nor called for the party to rally around the billionaire businessman.\n\n2016 Election Headquarters The latest headlines on the 2016 elections from the biggest name in politics.
