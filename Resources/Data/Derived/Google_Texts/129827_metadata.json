It featured action star Jean Claude Van Damme performing an \u201cEpic Split\u201d between two Volvo FM trucks in reverse.

But that\u2019s exactly what Mike Collins does in the video below.\n\nCollins is a Republican candidate for the 10th Congressional district in Georgia and the owner of Collins Trucking. In his version, the trucks are Peterbilt, not Volvo, and they\u2019re not running in reverse, but big kudos to Mike for doing his own stunts.\n\nAs to why Collins performed his own \u201cEpic Split,\u201d the video explains (jokingly, we\u2019d have to assume) it is to \u201cdemonstrate the dangers of Obamacare.\u201d Watch below.\n\n[youtube _rzKp6gYpSU nolink]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Equipment World Magazine - Construction Equipment, News and Information", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Equipment World", "og": {"url": "http://www.equipmentworld.com/video-trucking-company-owner-parodies-van-dammes-epic-split-to-demonstrate-the-dangers-of-obamacare/", "image": "http://www.equipmentworld.com/files/2013/12/Screen-Shot-2013-12-09-at-9.10.28-AM-1024x572.png", "type": "article", "title": "VIDEO: Trucking company owner parodies Van Damme\u2019s \u201cEpic Split\u201d to demonstrate the dangers of Obamacare"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.equipmentworld.com/files/2013/12/Screen-Shot-2013-12-09-at-9.10.28-AM-1024x572.png", "title": "VIDEO: Trucking company owner parodies Van Damme\u2019s \u201cEpic Split\u201d to demonstrate the dangers of Obamacare", "description": "A few weeks ago, an ad by Volvo Trucks took the Internet by storm.
