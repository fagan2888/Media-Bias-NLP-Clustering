The atmosphere was electric. Three months of protests had resulted in deadly clashes between demonstrators and security forces. From Washington to Moscow, the world was waiting to see what would happen next.\n\nA few in the crowd recognized the man. \u201cKlitschko!\u201d they shouted. \u201cThat\u2019s Klitschko!\u201d\n\nUkrainian opposition leader Vitali Klitschko, the 6-foot-7 former world heavyweight boxing champion, responded with characteristic humor.\n\nSEE ALSO: Russia besieges Crimea as U.S. seeks diplomacy; Putin remains undeterred by Obama\u2019s sanctions\n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m his brother,\u201d he said before climbing onto a stage to address 10,000 people.\n\nMr. Klitschko\u2019s younger brother, Wladimir, is the current world heavyweight boxing champion. Until recently, he was the sibling most likely to command vast audiences.\n\nLately, however, the attention has been squarely on the elder Mr. Klitschko, who is a serious contender to lead this Slavic country of nearly 45 million people.\n\nVitali Klitschko, 42, heads the Ukrainian Democratic Alliance for Reform, one of three opposition parties that came to power last month after street protests ousted President Viktor Yanukovych. The party\u2019s acronym, UDAR, spells out \u201cstrike,\u201d or \u201chit,\u201d in Ukrainian.\n\nMr. Klitschko didn\u2019t take a seat in the government he helped create. Instead, he announced soon after Mr. Yanukovych fled Kiev that he would run for president in the newly scheduled May 25 elections.\n\n\u201cThe main fight of my life is going on today,\u201d Mr. Klitschko told The Washington Times. \u201cIn politics, I\u2019ve seen a lot \u2014 games without rules, dirty tricks, cunning. But I\u2019m not used to giving up. I stayed in politics for the sake of my principles, for the goal that I had, and I was rewarded.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen Maidan [Independence Square]. I witnessed the courage and fortitude, braveness and self-sacrifice. This winter, I stood near real heroes \u2014 the people who wrote the new history of Ukraine under bullets.\n\n\u201cOur task today is to save Ukraine, save peace and sovereignty, unity and integrity, to build a new country,\u201d he said. \u201cI have no right to let these people down.\u201d\n\nHumble but cagey\n\nHis presidential announcement set the stage for a confrontation between Mr. Klitschko and the colossus of Ukrainian politics \u2014 the blond-braided Yulia Tymoshenko, the former prime minister and Orange Revolution leader who was imprisoned in 2011 on a widely disputed abuse-of-power conviction. Parliament freed her late last month after the Yanukovych regime collapsed.\n\nMr. Klitschko entered politics eight years ago and won a seat on Kiev\u2019s City Council. He ran twice for mayor unsuccessfully.\n\nBut he also organized UDAR, which two years ago won 14 percent of the vote, enough to become the third-largest party in parliament.\n\nUDAR lawmaker Pavlo Rozenko said Mr. Klitschko is a sincere politician, a rare find in Ukrainian politics. He recalled how Mr. Klitschko reached out to him in the summer of 2012 as he was expanding the party.\n\n\u201cThe meeting wasn\u2019t scheduled in advance, and I was outside Kiev. But Klitschko just said, \u2018OK, I\u2019ll come to you,\u2019 and made a drive. I was pleasantly impressed about how it was OK for the party leader to just jump in a car and come meet a potential member,\u201d said Mr. Rozenko.\n\nThe former heavyweight champion is also humble, the lawmaker said.\n\n\u201cHe is never ashamed to admit that he doesn\u2019t know something and to ask about it,\u201d said Mr. Rozenko. \u201cHe is always willing to learn.\u201d\n\nBut Mr. Klitschko also is a tactician who continually sizes up opponents and friends.\n\n\u201cI think it is a psychological skill he brought from his career in boxing,\u201d Mr. Rozenko said. \u201cIt helps him choosing right people for his team.\u201d\n\nCritics say Mr. Klitschko was too quick to seek an agreement with Mr. Yanukovych after the bloodshed in Kiev, a move that could cost him support with the protesters in Independence Square.\n\n\u2018New faces, new decisions\u2019\n\nEven so, Mr. Klitschko\u2019s role as a moderate voice in a country where politicians often exploit cultural tensions has given UDAR broad appeal.\n\n\u201cHe can unify Ukrainians to some extent because he knows the Russian-speaking Ukrainians. He made a statement on Independence Square, and he was speaking in Russian, directing his message to Russian-speaking Ukrainians,\u201d said Serhiy Solodky, deputy director of the Institute of World Policy in Kiev. \u201cLots of people from different regions of Ukraine voted for him in the last parliamentary elections. We can talk about him as a unifying candidate.\u201d\n\nThat style has given him good standing among Ukrainians who are weary of Ms. Tymoshenko and other longtime politicians.\n\n\u201cUkrainians are tired of the old faces in politics,\u201d said Mr. Solodky. \u201cUkrainians need new faces, new decisions, new ideas. They need a kind of dream politician, and Klitschko was a reflection of this dream. He was a reflection of a success story for Ukrainian citizens. That is why lots of people respected him, trusted him, and want to see him as a president.\u201d\n\nProtester Olena Dubovik, a Kiev student, agreed.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have much admiration for any political leaders, but I think I would vote for Klitschko at presidential elections,\u201d said Ms. Dubovik. \u201cI like that he got rich in a clear legal way, not through some murky schemes like some other top politicians here.\u201d\n\nStill, Mr. Klitschko\u2019s raw, straightforward manner sometimes backfires on him.\n\nWhen he was trying to calm a crowd during a January street protest, he was caught cursing at demonstrators who scuffled with him. He also has been videotaped cursing at reporters who intently challenge and question him.\n\nEven Mr. Klitschko acknowledges he is not polished.\n\n\u201cWhen I started my political career, public speeches were tough for me,\u201d he told a radio interviewer late last year. \u201cThe key thing is to speak from your heart.\u201d\n\nDespite the outbursts, Mr. Klitschko last month was among a group of Ukrainian opposition figures chosen to journey to Berlin with new Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk to ask German Chancellor Angela Merkel for aid from the European Union. He apparently impressed delegates on the mission.\n\n\u201cVictory for Ukraine means a modern European state with stable institutions,\u201d he said, delivering comments in articulate German during a press conference. \u201cIt is in the interests of the European Union that Ukraine is political and economically stable because instability in Ukraine can lead to instability in the whole region.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Luigi Serenelli in Berlin contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Vitali Klitschko heads the Ukrainian Democratic Alliance for Reform, one of three opposition parties that came to power last month after street protests ousted President Viktor Yanukovych.", "Author": "Olga Rudenko \u2014 Special to The Washington Times", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Vitali Klitschko heads the Ukrainian Democratic Alliance for Reform, one of three opposition parties that came to power last month after street protests ousted President Viktor Yanukovych.", "title": "Ex-boxer Klitschko eyes prize in Ukraine politics", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/mar/9/ex-boxer-klitschko-eyes-prize-in-ukraine-politics/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/03/09/3_9_2014_ukraine-2-68201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/03/09/3_9_2014_ukraine-2-68201.jpg", "title": "Ex-boxer Klitschko eyes prize in Ukraine politics", "description": "Vitali Klitschko heads the Ukrainian Democratic Alliance for Reform, one of three opposition parties that came to power last month after street protests ousted President Viktor Yanukovych.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Politics, Vitali Klitschko, Ukraine"}, "article_summary": "UDAR lawmaker Pavlo Rozenko said Mr. Klitschko is a sincere politician, a rare find in Ukrainian politics.\nHe recalled how Mr. Klitschko reached out to him in the summer of 2012 as he was expanding the party.\n\u201cHe is always willing to learn.\u201dBut Mr. Klitschko also is a tactician who continually sizes up opponents and friends.\n\u201cThe main fight of my life is going on today,\u201d Mr. Klitschko told The Washington Times.\nMr. Klitschko entered politics eight years ago and won a seat on Kiev\u2019s City Council."}
