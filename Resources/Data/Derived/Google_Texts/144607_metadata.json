If teenagers and poor women were offered free intrauterine devices and implants that prevent pregnancy for years, state officials asked, would those women choose them?\n\nThey did in a big way, and the results were startling. The birthrate for Colorado teenagers plunged 40 percent from 2009 to 2013, while their rate of abortions fell 42 percent, according to the state\u2019s Department of Public Health and Environment. There was a similar decline in births for another group particularly vulnerable to unplanned pregnancies: unmarried women younger than 25 who have not finished high school.\n\n\u201cOur demographer came into my office with a chart and said, \u2018Greta, look at this, we\u2019ve never seen this before,\u2019 \u201d said Greta Klingler, the department\u2019s family-planning supervisor. \u201cThe numbers were plummeting.\u201d\n\nThe changes were particularly pronounced in the poorest areas of the state, places like Walsenburg, a small city in southern Colorado where jobs are scarce and unplanned births come often to the young.\n\nHope Martinez, a 20-year-old nursing-home receptionist here, recently had a small metal rod implanted under the skin of her upper arm to prevent pregnancy for three years. She has plans \u2014 to marry, to move West, and to become a dental hygienist. \u201cI don\u2019t want any babies for a while,\u201d she said.\n\nMore young women are making that choice. In 2009, half of all first births to women in the poorest areas of the state happened before they turned 21. By 2014, half of first births did not occur until they had turned 24, a difference that advocates say gives young women time to finish their educations and gain a foothold in an increasingly competitive job market.\n\n\u201cIf we want to reduce poverty, one of the simplest, fastest and cheapest things we could do would be to make sure that as few people as possible become parents before they actually want to,\u201d said Isabel Sawhill, an economist at the Brookings Institution.\n\nShe argues in her 2014 book, \u201cGeneration Unbound: Drifting Into Sex and Parenthood Without Marriage,\u201d that single parenthood is a principal driver of inequality and long-acting birth control a powerful tool to prevent it.\n\nTeenage births have been declining nationally, but experts say the timing and magnitude of the reductions in Colorado are a strong indication the state\u2019s program was a major driver.\n\nAbout one-fifth of women ages 18 to 44 in Colorado now use a long-acting method, a substantial increase driven largely by teenagers and poor women.\n\nThe surge in Colorado has far outpaced the growing use of such methods nationwide. About 7 percent of American women ages 15 to 44 used long-acting birth control from 2011 to 2013, the most recent period studied, up from 1.5 percent in 2002. The figures include all women, even those who were pregnant or sterilized. The share of long-acting contraception users among just women using birth control is likely to be higher.\n\nBut Colorado\u2019s experiment is entering an uncertain phase that will test a promise of the Affordable Care Act: free contraception.\n\nThe private grant that funds the state program has started to run out. While many young women are expected to be covered under the health law, some plans require payment or offer only certain methods, problems the Obama administration is trying to correct.\n\nWhat is more, only new plans are required to provide free contraception, so women on plans that predate the law may not qualify. (In 2014, about a quarter of people covered through their employers were on grandfathered plans, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.)\n\nAdvocates also worry that teenagers \u2014 who can get the devices at clinics confidentially \u2014 may be less likely to get the devices through their parents\u2019 insurance. Long-acting devices can cost between $800 and $900.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no lifeboat with the Affordable Care Act,\u201d said Liz Romer, a nurse practitioner who runs the Adolescent Medicine Program at Children\u2019s Hospital Colorado, which went from giving out 30 long-acting devices a year in 2009 to more than 2,000 in 2013.\n\nThe state failed to get additional funding through the Republican-controlled Legislature this spring, a shortfall Klingler said would slow, but not stop, the state\u2019s progress.\n\nWomen\u2019s health advocates contend that long-acting birth control is giving American women more say over when \u2014 and with whom \u2014 they have children.\n\nAbout half the 6.6 million pregnancies a year in the United States are unintended. Teenage births may be down, but unplanned births have simply moved up the age scale, Sawhill said, and having a baby before finishing college can be just as risky to a woman\u2019s future as having one while in high school.\n\nColorado\u2019s program, funded by a private grant from the Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation, named for billionaire Warren Buffett\u2019s late wife, was the real-world version of a research study in St. Louis, (also paid for by the foundation, which does not publicly acknowledge its role) that came to the same conclusion: Women overwhelmingly chose the long-acting methods, and pregnancy and abortion rates plunged.\n\nThe methods are effective because, unlike the pill, a diaphragm or condoms, they do not require a woman to take action to work. And while an early incarnation, the Dalkon Shield introduced in the 1970s, had disastrous results, the modern devices are safe and increasingly promoted by doctors.\n\nLast fall, the American Academy of Pediatrics published guidelines that for the first time singled them out as a \u201cfirst-line\u201d birth control option for adolescents, citing their \u201cefficacy, safety and ease of use.\u201d\n\nIn Walsenburg, studded with boarded-up buildings, advocates have used the Buffett grant to help women get more control.\n\n\u201cIf you get pregnant here, you are stuck,\u201d said Debbie Channel, manager of the Spanish Peaks Regional Health Center\u2019s Outreach and Women\u2019s Clinic, where Martinez, the nursing-home receptionist, got her implant. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to keep them safe and baby free.\u201d\n\nProponents say the program is working. The state health department estimated that every dollar spent on the long-acting birth-control initiative saved $5.85 for the state\u2019s Medicaid program, which covers more than three-quarters of teenage pregnancies and births. Enrollment in the federal nutrition program for women with young children declined nearly a quarter between 2010 and 2013.\n\nMartinez watched girls in her high school get trapped when they became mothers too soon, and she knew she did not want that for herself. She plans to leave town this summer after she marries her fianc\u00e9, now in California in military training. She is excited.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not scared at all,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m just really ready.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Teenage births have been declining nationally, but experts say the timing and magnitude of the reductions in Colorado are a strong indication that the state\u2019s program using a long-acting method of birth control was a major driver.", "og": {"site_name": "The Seattle Times", "description": "Teenage births have been declining nationally, but experts say the timing and magnitude of the reductions in Colorado are a strong indication that the state\u2019s program using a long-acting method of birth control was a major driver.", "title": "Colorado\u2019s push against teen pregnancies proves huge success", "url": "http://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/colorados-push-against-teen-pregnancies-proves-huge-success/", "image": {"width": 1560, "identifier": "http://static.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/ada53022-236e-11e5-a64c-2193f48f60bc-1560x1129.jpg", "height": 1129}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@seattletimes", "description": "Teenage births have been declining nationally, but experts say the timing and magnitude of the reductions in Colorado are a strong indication that the state\u2019s program using a long-acting method of birth control was a major driver.", "card": "http://static.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/ada53022-236e-11e5-a64c-2193f48f60bc-780x564.jpg", "title": "Colorado\u2019s push against teen pregnancies proves huge success"}, "robots": "noarchive", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=329502124", "fb": {"admins": 2737159, "app_id": 1522735777957334, "pages": 38472826214}, "msvalidate.01": "29FBBD36D14799A9FDE7843BF1E1CDD7", "article": {"section": "Nation & World", "published_time": "2015-07-05 17:49:23", "modified_time": "2015-07-05 17:49:23"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Nation & World, Life, Lifestyle, Nation, Wellness"}, "article_summary": "WALSENBURG, Colo. \u2014Over the past six years, Colorado has conducted one of the largest real-life experiments with long-acting birth control.\nWomen\u2019s health advocates contend that long-acting birth control is giving American women more say over when \u2014 and with whom \u2014 they have children.\nThe private grant that funds the state program has started to run out.\nThe share of long-acting contraception users among just women using birth control is likely to be higher.\nShe argues in her 2014 book, \u201cGeneration Unbound: Drifting Into Sex and Parenthood Without Marriage,\u201d that single parenthood is a principal driver of inequality and long-acting birth control a powerful tool to prevent it."}
