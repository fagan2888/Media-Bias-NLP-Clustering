A surgeon has been suspended by a British hospital following news reports that he branded his initials on a patient's liver.

Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham, England confirmed to ABCNews.com that it has suspended a surgeon over misconduct, but declined to describe the misconduct. University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, which runs the hospital, said the surgeon will remain on suspension until an internal investigation can be completed.

The hospital confirmed the suspension following reports that the doctor's initials were found on a patient's liver by a colleague during a subsequent operation.
