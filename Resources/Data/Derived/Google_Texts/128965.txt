The Cape San Blas Lighthouse is preparing for a big move.

Crews will transport the lighthouse and its Fuel and Keepers Houses from the cape to downtown Port St. Joe Tuesday at 8 a.m.

The lighthouse is laying down and ready for the 12 mile ride.

The trip should take six to eight hours, so prepare for delayed traffic along Cape San Blas Road, State Route 30A and Highway 98.

A power company will travel ahead of and behind the convoy to take down power lines along the way.

Its final resting point will be on the bay between Shipyard Cove and George Core Park.

NewChannel 7 will be in Port St. Joe Tuesday to see the lighthouse arrive at the finish line.
