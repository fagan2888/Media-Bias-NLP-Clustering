The two terms also evoked differing reactions from conservatives, who were more likely to describe global warming as a \u201cvery bad thing\u201d over climate change by 8 percentage points.\n\n\n\n[ ALSO: Climate Science Far From 'Settled,' Says Top Chamber Official] The findings have direct political implications: \u201cGlobal warming\u201d correlated with greater willingness among men, Generation Xers, liberals and moderates to join an advocacy campaign, and with higher priority ratings for federal action on climate change, especially among liberals, moderates and women. \"Climate change,\" by comparison \u2013 while generally preferred by scientists because the planet is not warming uniformly \u2013 was more often associated with merely the \"weather,\" as opposed to \"extreme weather.\"", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Politics [News]", "title": "Americans Care About 'Global Warming,' Less About 'Climate Change'", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "People react more strongly to the term 'global warming' than they do to 'climate change,' a new report says.", "title": "Americans Care About 'Global Warming,' Less About 'Climate Change'", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/05/27/americans-care-about-global-warming-less-about-climate-change", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/83/21/77ca86814df482af771b4dd18b89/140512-taxis-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@USNews", "description": "People react more strongly to the term 'global warming' than they do to 'climate change,' a new report says.", "card": "summary", "title": "Americans Care About 'Global Warming,' Less About 'Climate Change'"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "news", "date_published": "May 27, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Alan Neuhauser,global warming,energy policy and climate change,climate change,Pulse,picks,environment,Yale University,George Mason University,politics,campaigns,Politics [News]", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "People react more strongly to the term 'global warming' than they do to 'climate change,' a new report says."}, "article_summary": "Twelve years after GOP political consultant Frank Luntz warned President George W.
