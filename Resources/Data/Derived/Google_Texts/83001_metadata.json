Justin Amash, R-Mich., told reporters today at a panel event on Capitol Hill. \u201cI think this is posturing. I don\u2019t believe these senators who object to it really object to it. They accept the Freedom Act and they\u2019re trying to buy some leverage to make it even worse.\u201d\n\nUnder the USA Freedom Act, the National Security Agency\u2019s bulk data collection program would be terminated, and phone companies would be responsible for retaining customer data.\n\nWith court approval, government officials could then request some of that data for its terrorist investigations.\n\nThe measure easily passed the House last week despite some conservatives voting against it. Those opponents argue the legislation doesn\u2019t go far enough in preventing bulk data collection.\n\n\u201cI voted against the Freedom Act not because it was too strong, but because it wasn\u2019t strong enough,\u201d said Rep. Ra\u00fal Labrador, R-Idaho. \u201cIt didn\u2019t protect the Fourth Amendment like it should.\u201d\n\nMcConnell, R-Ky., opposes the USA Freedom Act for a different reason.\n\nHe argues that ending the program could be dangerous to America\u2019s national security.\n\nInstead, McConnell is fighting for a two-month extension of the Patriot Act, which is set to expire on May 31.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want us to go dark, in effect, and I\u2019m afraid that the House-passed bill will basically be the end of the program and we will not able to have yet another tool that we need to combat this terrorist threat from overseas,\u201d McConnell said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d\n\nMcConnell, along with other Bush-era Republicans, fear that phone companies are not prepared to retain mass amounts of data, which could potentially harm anti-terrorist investigations.\n\nHouse conservatives dismissed that concern, and said there\u2019s \u201cno support\u201d for a clean reauthorization of the Patriot Act.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a waste of time for Mitch McConnell to really even talk about it because it has no chance in the House and I think no chance in the Senate,\u201d Amash said.\n\nRep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., a conservative member of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, echoed Amash\u2019s sentiment.\n\nI believe this is just posturing right now and tactful negotiation to say that we\u2019re going to do a clean reauthorization to hold that over the heads of conservative senators to get them to comply and finally agree with the reserve price, which is the Freedom Act that passed the House.\n\nThe extent of the bulk data collection came to light when former NSA contractor Edward Snowden leaked documents, exposing a secret court order that mandated Verizon hand over its phone records for all of its customers.\n\nLibertarians, conservatives and Democrats alike have rallied against the agency\u2019s data-mining tactics, arguing that it\u2019s a violation of the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Conservatives accuse Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of playing politics with a measure designed to scale back the government\u2019s mining of personal.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Conservatives accuse Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of playing politics with a measure designed to scale back the government\u2019s mining of personal.", "title": "Is McConnell Playing Politics With NSA \u2018Spying\u2019 Program?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/mcconnell_052015.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-05-20T18:17:43+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1Lc3163"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Conservatives accuse Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of playing politics with a measure designed to scale back the government\u2019s mining of personal.", "title": "Is McConnell Playing Politics With NSA \u2018Spying\u2019 Program?", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/mcconnell_052015.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Security", "tag": "cyber", "published_time": "2015-05-20T16:32:36+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-20T18:17:43+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "USA Freedom Act, National Security Agency, Mitch McConnell, nsa, nsa data"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI believe Mitch McConnell supports the USA Freedom Act,\u201d Rep.
