Seventy-four Californians with health coverage under the Department of Health Care Services are estimated to receive the drug this year, and next year, 220 people will benefit, some of whom may be the same patients as this year. That does not include any discounts the state may receive from drug manufacturers.\n\nOrkambi is listed as a \u201cspecialty tier\u201d drug in some private health plans. That category is reserved for high-cost drugs, or, in the federal government\u2019sview, for drugs that cost more than $600 a month and are used by a small proportion of patients.\n\nSpecialty drugs are already proving to be a financial burden on one California agency, the California Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System, which purchases health benefits for active and retired state workers. The state public pension system says that specialty drugs made up less than 1 percent of all prescriptions for its members but 30 percent of the total drugs costs in 2014.\n\nThe health benefits from specialty drugs justify the cost, according to the pharmaceutical industry.\n\n\u201cPatients are gaining access to medicines that are better treating their diseases or frankly even curing them,\u201d said Priscilla VanderVeer, deputy vice president of communications at the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA). \u201cPatients are now healthier. They\u2019re more productive. They\u2019re functioning.\u201d\n\nVanderVeer said companies price drugs not just on the cost of production, but on the value the industry believes the drug brings to the health care system, such as:\n\nEfficacy of the treatment\n\nHow it increases the quality or length of life\n\nThe \u201cunmet need\u201d in the drug market\n\nThe price of the drug also accounts for the cost of developing other drugs and the high risk that a particular drug won\u2019t make it to market, VanderVeer said. Only 12 percent of drugs that go through clinical trials get approved, according to PhRMA.\n\n\u201cBecause of that high rate of failures there would be no innovative incentive for companies to continue to try to invest\u201d if they could not recoup costs and make a profit, VanderVeer said.\n\nFinally, she added, the sticker price doesn\u2019t reflect the final price paid for the drug, which can be heavily discounted through negotiations or because of mandated rebates for Medicaid programs.\n\nDrugmakers are following the money, said Joel Hay, professor of pharmaceutical economics and policy at USC. Companies invest in specialty drugs that target a small population because their high price tags can be spread over a large insurance pool, he said.\n\nEven though specialty drugs are \u201cridiculously expensive per treatment episode,\u201d Hay said, the cost for each member in a health plan is \u201cjust a few cents.\u201d Raising 10 cents on a diabetes drug, for example, would have a bigger budget impact, he said, because more people have diabetes than cystic fibrosis.\n\nHay says manufacturers are now less inclined to invest in drugs that treat millions of people, because there is more pushback on price.\n\n\u201cDrug companies are for-profit companies obligated to make money for their stockholders,\u201d Hay said. \u201cThey\u2019re not virtuous charitable organizations.\u201d\n\nDrugmakers are also investing more in treating uncommon illnesses because there is less competition and therefore more opportunity for profit, said Dr. Helene Lipton, professor of health policy at the School of Pharmacy and Institute for Health Policy Studies at UC San Francisco.\n\nThe high price of the drugs affects patients, she noted, because health plans put controls on the drugs so that they\u2019re used as a last resort.\n\n\u201cThat may mean going through two or more rounds of care with other medications before being able to use the specialty drug,\u201d Lipton said.\n\nIt\u2019s not just specialty drugs that are straining health plans\u2019 budgets, said Steve Miller, chief medical officer at Express Scripts, a pharmaceutical benefits manager that negotiates drug prices for 7.5 million Californians.\n\n\u201cThe price of drugs is just continuing to go up,\u201d said Miller, explaining that the trend is due to both new high-cost drugs coming on the market, and mark-ups of old drugs.\n\nThere\u2019s been an explosion of drugs costing $100,000 a year over the last decade, for things like cystic fibrosis and cancer, Miller said. And there was a 127 percent price increase of branded drugs that had been on the market between 2008 and 2014, he says.\n\nLimiting the cost of pharmaceuticals is the basis of a California ballot initiative scheduled to go before voters this November that would limit the amount the state pays for a drug to no more than the lowest price paid for the same drug by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.\n\nWe\u2019ll be exploring how a specialty drug\u2019s cost affects patient access.
