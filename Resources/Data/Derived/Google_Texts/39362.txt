Gov. Hickenlooper should pardon, or at least commute the sentence of Mr. Samba Kane, a 57-year-old Senegalese immigrant who was wrongfully convicted of murder and unjustly sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole in 1999.

Mr. Kane has since served 17 years in state prison, with a perfect record of good behavior.

Mr. Kane was arrested in Adams County after being forced to defend himself by shooting a Nigerian man who had attacked him after Mr. Kane walked into his own bedroom and caught the Nigerian man having sexual relations with his wife.

His wrongful conviction was the result of poverty, racism and a poor understanding of a confusing foreign system with a different language.

A pardon would allow Mr. Kane, an honest hard-working immigrant whose American dream turned into a Kafkaesque nightmare, to return to his home county of Senegal, Africa.

I urge all Coloradans to call Gov. Hickenlooper at (303) 866-2471 and tell him to pardon Samba Kane.
