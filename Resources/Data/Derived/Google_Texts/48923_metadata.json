Tomaso School\n\nAt the March 2 Warren Township Board of Education meeting, fifth-grade students from Angelo L. Tomaso School gave a presentation about a new proposed club they and other student believe should be started at their school.\n\nLanguage Arts teacher Michelle Jarmicki explained how she tasked the students to identify a problem in ALT School or within the Warren Township community. In small groups, the children worked as a team towards possible solutions that would promote a positive change at school or in town. The group, made up of Luca Cianfano, Nicole Ling, James Palaia, and Aryan Singh, felt that ALT had fewer community service opportunities than they would like, and that it was lacking a specific organization or club to spearhead many service projects. Their solution was to create a structured ALT Service Club to focus on a variety of projects such as community clean-ups, tree planting, food collections, clothing donations, and more.\n\nWhat makes their idea unique is that they not only would be members of the community service club, both organizing and involved, but they would be activists in the process to encourage others to make a difference, including school administrators, faculty and students in all grades. The students invited Superintendent Dr. Tami Crader, Board President Jim Sena, and the other members of the Board of Education to unite as well.\n\nOver the course of five weeks, the students defined, discovered, designed and delivered information; they researched online and organized their findings via Google Slides in Drive, which was then presented on the SmartBoard in class and at the Board meeting. \"My students know they are fortunate to live in Warren and to attend ALT. Although they voiced that it was a challenge to find a problem per say, they recognize how much of a difference they can make through service,\" Jarmicki said.\n\nAngelo L. Tomaso School fifth-grade students, left to right, Nicole Ling, Luca Cianfano, Aryan Singh, and James Palaia, with their teacher, Michelle Jarmicki, presented their idea for a new club at the school in Warren to Board of Education members. (Photo: By K. BOND)\n\nWarren Township Schools/Woodland School\n\nThe Woodland School fourth grade recently completed a unit on the Lenni Lenape of New Jersey. The students in the classes of Brian Kilroy, Colleen Krumm, and Margee Pfeifer were given the task of working in teams to define, discover, design, and deliver information to their peers about the lifestyle and culture of the state's native people. Students used technology to gather their research and to create their presentations. Each team became an expert on a specific aspect of Lenape village life, and the students collaboratively learned from each other all about our state's Native American history.\n\nThe unit culminated with a presentation by Rob Aptaker, of Young Audiences of New Jersey, an expert on all aspects of Lenape history and culture. The students were enthralled by Aptaker's ability to bring ancient village life into Woodland School through music, authentic clothing, language, and artifacts. The presentation was funded by Woodland PTO's Dream It, Fund It program.\n\nRob Aptaker (left) invited Sebastian Nunez to select an item so he could explain in detail what it was, how it was made, and how it was used during a presentation at Woodland School in Warren. Aptaker talked about how the Lenape made their own string from small trees and gave each student a branch so he/she could have a hands-on experience. (Photo: PHOTO COURTESY OF J.
