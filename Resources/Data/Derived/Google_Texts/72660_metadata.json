John Barrow was highlighting a relationship-building experience he said illustrates his strategy to remove the top-down regulations he believes are killing east-central Georgia\u2019s economy.\n\nIf elected Nov. 4, Allen, a 62-year-old construction company owner from Augusta, said he\u2019ll work to repeal the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as \u201cObamacare;\u201d eliminate unnecessary environmental and safety regulations burdening farmers; and allow local banks and small businesses to say what practices are best for them through a system of peer reviews.\n\n\u201cWe have to stop what this administration is trying to do to this country,\u201d Allen said Monday at Sunrise Grill in Martinez before starting a four-day bus tour through the district. \u201cThey\u2019re running wild. All of them need to be reined in.\u201d\n\nAllen believes the economy is ready to grow and said it can under a Democratic president, but only with a Republican-controlled Congress.\n\nFor instance, he argued that under Democratic President Bill Clinton and a Republican majority, a well-balanced budget resulted in a booming economy in the late 1990s and the U.S. having a projected federal surplus for the first time in 30 years.\n\nToday, he said, a $500 billion deficit and added compliance and costs required under the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act have almost paralyzed the district\u2019s small banks, the largest lenders for small businesses, which create 60 percent of the region\u2019s jobs.\n\n\u201cWe have to get the government off the backs of the business community,\u201d said Allen, whose first plan of action is to work with constituents to determine what\u2019s clogging up the economy. \u201cPeople are making more money sitting at home than going to work. The government shouldn\u2019t be doing that. We must give folks an incentive to work, otherwise we will not be competitive globally.\u201d\n\nBorn and raised in Evans, Allen said he has specialized in free enterprise for 27 years through the support of his Christian faith, his wife of 41 years, Robin Allen, and his four now-grown children.\n\nHe has no experience in public service, but nearly qualified to run against Barrow in 2012, losing the Republican nomination to Columbia County farmer and former State Rep. Lee Anderson by 159 votes in a primary runoff.\n\nHe said through a lot of family encouragement he decided to run again and this time, after gaining commitments lost to Anderson in 2012 and studying midterm voting trends for the counties added to the 12th district\u2019s in 2011, he projects a 58-42 win.\n\nAllen said he will not become a career politician like Barrow, who is running for his sixth term. He plans to only stay eight years \u2013 or four terms \u2013 an agreement he made with his wife to return home and spend time with his eight grandchildren, one of whom is on the way.\n\n\u201cHe does not need a job \u2013 we\u2019ve had a job and a career already \u2013 but he really is passionate about this country and the direction it\u2019s heading,\u201d Robin Allen said. \u201cWe hope our children and grandchildren have the same opportunity for the American dream that we had.\u201d\n\nAllen asked voters to help this vision become a reality.\n\n\u201cIf you like the direction this country is headed, vote for the same guy, but if you want real change, send a businessman to Washington and we will fix this,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Augusta, georgia, newspaper, classifieds, augusta chronicle news, news, sports, entertainment, local information, masters, golf, masters tournament, local businesses, shopping, daily deals, north augusta, SRS, south carolina, CSRA, aiken, Elections, Government, Politics, Metro, Latest News, Wesley Brown", "og": {"site_name": "The Augusta Chronicle", "description": "If elected Nov. 4, Allen plans to work to repeal the Affordable Care Act; eliminate unnecessary regulation burdening farmers; and allow local banks and small businesses to say what practices are best for them through a system of peer reviews.", "title": "Republican Rick Allen targets overregulation in congressional campaign", "url": "http://chronicle.augusta.com/news/government/elections/2014-10-23/republican-rick-allen-targets-overregulation-congressional", "image": "http://chronicle.augusta.com/sites/default/files/13816405.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "Augusta Georgia\u2019s source for News, Entertainment, Sports, Weather, Classifieds, Jobs, Autos, Real Estate and Masters information from The Augusta Chronicle, chronicle.augusta.com"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf2b9\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe have to stop what this administration is trying to do to this country,\u201d Allen said Monday at Sunrise Grill in Martinez before starting a four-day bus tour through the district.\nAllen said he will not become a career politician like Barrow, who is running for his sixth term.\nHe attended an afterhours networking event in Dublin, toured Crider Foods manufacturing in Stillmore, and visited Rocker Supply in Millen and Yardmaster in Swainsboro, two family-owned small businesses that sell a variety of home and garden supplies.\nToday, he said, a $500 billion deficit and added compliance and costs required under the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act have almost paralyzed the district\u2019s small banks, the largest lenders for small businesses, which create 60 percent of the region\u2019s jobs.\n\u201cWe hope our children and grandchildren have the same opportunity for the American dream that we had.\u201dAllen asked voters to help this vision become a reality."}
