In June, he wrote a Washington Post op-ed calling for a new third class of worker \u2014 somewhere in between contractor and employee \u2014 to fit the needs of on-demand and marketplace companies. \u201cThis question is too important to leave to the courts alone,\u201d he said in his post.\n\nSo what does he think of Clinton\u2019s recent comments about the lack of worker protection in these new business models?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad that a leading candidate for President is talking about this issue,\u201d Warner told Re/code. \u201cAs the folks running really dive into the details, they\u2019ll learn like I have just how many and how complex the challenges and the opportunities are.\u201d Soon after speaking with us, Warner penned a Medium post defending Clinton from critics who claimed she \u201chates\u201d Uber and Airbnb.\n\nBefore getting into politics, Warner was an investor at a venture firm he started \u2014 Columbia Capital \u2014 and co-founded the company that went on to become wireless service operator Nextel. Although he represents Virginia\u2019s interests, he keeps a close eye on Silicon Valley.\n\nWe spoke with Warner about the current relationship between the tech industry and Washington, what makes Uber\u2019s worker classification issue different from Walmart and whether a third class of worker would be a form of socialism. The interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nRe/code: What is the likelihood a third classification of employee could be created?\n\nMark Warner: I think it\u2019s very possible. This is one of the fastest growing sectors of our economy. The idea that you\u2019ll default this to hundreds of thousands of separate litigations, that doesn\u2019t make sense.\n\n(Editor\u2019s note: Several gig-economy companies such as ride-share services Uber and Lyft and cleaning companies Handy and Homejoy are battling lawsuits about how they classify their workers. There\u2019s hundreds of millions of dollars riding on the outcome.)\n\nWhat would it take for a third class of employees to be created?\n\nPressure from folks in this part of the economy, stories of people not being treated fairly, seeing some of the upsides of this economy.\n\nHow long will it take? One to three years? Five to 10?\n\nOne to three.\n\nThat seems really short.\n\nI\u2019m optimistic because I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an issue on a liberal conservative continuum, I think it\u2019s more of a future-past issue.\n\nWhat does a third classification of employee look like?\n\nI don\u2019t have a prescriptive answer today. I do think there are models, maybe public-private, maybe an hour bank. I want to sit down with entrepreneurs and figure out what works.\n\n(Editor\u2019s note: Public-private partnership occurs when private businesses team up with the government to complete a project or offer benefits. The government provides tax breaks or funding for the private company\u2019s work. The Affordable Care Act is one such example, with the government subsidizing people\u2019s purchase of private health insurance.)\n\nWouldn\u2019t a third classification of employee be a form of socialism? After all, if the employer isn\u2019t paying for the benefits, the government is the only other entity that can.\n\nDoes it have to be the government? Could it be a third private party? The hour bank idea goes back to the 1940s in the building trade union. If you were a carpenter with ten different jobs over the year, [you] didn\u2019t have the government, but [you] had the union which would collect money from the contractor and the employer, money jointly managed by a third party.\n\nI could imagine platforms created that might be tax advantaged that aren\u2019t necessarily run through the government. Characterizing this as an only public model or only private is a 20th century mindset to a 21st century problem.\n\nYou\u2019ve positioned the worker classification issue as a new one tied to the advent of the on-demand industry. But haven\u2019t there been people working multiple part-time jobs for years, the Walmart way?\n\nThere\u2019s different sectors that would roll their eyes at the idea that the gig economy is something new. But there has been something happening the last five or six years, with the Ubers and the Lyfts and the Task Rabbits and the Airbnbs. It\u2019s a very different set of rules.\n\nYou also have some of this brought about by economic dislocation from the recession. Even if you\u2019re doing economically well there is no social safety net. You\u2019re operating on a high wire and all that will catch you is the core government assistant programs.\n\nWhy do you care about this? Few other politicians have bothered to discuss it, aside from the recent Clinton remarks and Senator Elizabeth Warren\u2019s comments at the Code conference.\n\nAs someone who got engaged in the wireless revolution of the \u201980s and then as a venture capitalist, I\u2019ve seen the ability of technology to transform and change people\u2019s lives.\n\nI went into the [venture] business so if I ever went into politics I could be rich enough to lose. Policy issues that are future-past instead of left-right, I see that as the political framework I bring.\n\nHave you raised money from the tech industry?\n\nI\u2019ve always had broad-based support from the tech community. I know you think everything in tech comes from Silicon Valley but in terms of sheer number of tech companies [Virginia] actually rivals the valley. Maybe not in terms of the startup side.\n\n(Editor\u2019s note: Senator Warner took at least $280,000 from individuals who work for or PACs representing Microsoft, Google, Comcast, Verizon, Kleiner Perkins investment firm and other tech and venture outlets from 2009 to 2014, according to OpenSecrets. However, no tech companies cracked his top twenty donors \u2014 those were mostly banks.)\n\nHow would you describe the relationship between the tech industry and Washington D.C. at this point?\n\nWary. The normal sense in Silicon Valley is leave us alone. I get that in terms of \u2018The government doesn\u2019t often respond, it\u2019s still at dial-up speed.\u2019 But recent debates around net neutrality and elsewhere show there\u2019s a recognition that they can\u2019t leave us alone.\n\n[Worker classification] could be an area of collaboration instead of conflict. There\u2019s not a lot of policy makers talking about this. If this transformation is taking place in the workplace it begs bigger questions, like how do you make capitalism work?", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#ed2b23", "description": "\"I went into the venture business so I could be rich enough to lose in politics.\"", "author": "Carmel DeAmicis", "og": {"site_name": "Recode", "description": "\"I went into the venture business so I could be rich enough to lose in politics.\"", "title": "U.S. Senator Mark Warner on Why We Need a New Class of Worker (Q&A)", "url": "http://www.recode.net/2015/7/15/11614744/u-s-senator-mark-warner-on-why-we-need-a-new-class-of-worker-qa", "image": "https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oQGDsP1Qax3UrwHziRGkqJnwnLs=/0x107:2048x1259/1600x900/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/49526315/18462246182_e82a6d3646_k.0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"I went into the venture business so I could be rich enough to lose in politics.\"", "title": "U.S. Senator Mark Warner on Why We Need a New Class of Worker (Q&A)", "url": "http://www.recode.net/2015/7/15/11614744/u-s-senator-mark-warner-on-why-we-need-a-new-class-of-worker-qa", "image": {"src": "https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oQGDsP1Qax3UrwHziRGkqJnwnLs=/0x107:2048x1259/1600x900/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/49526315/18462246182_e82a6d3646_k.0.jpg"}, "site": "Recode", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-07-15", "sailthru.title": "U.S. Senator Mark Warner on Why We Need a New Class of Worker (Q&A)", "fb": {"app_id": 186672874861631}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6397045/recode_favicon-144.0.png", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-15T19:05:29Z"}, "sailthru.tags": "general,recode", "google-site-verification": "hjxK0n4cwDZzIl6phvogE8im4UEcc5HKC14Tl5HI-Jk", "style-tools": "/style/544b8f43cb1469523be0f2c1310c5b15/tools.css", "sailthru.description": "\"I went into the venture business so I could be rich enough to lose in politics.\"", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2430\"", "article_summary": "You\u2019ve positioned the worker classification issue as a new one tied to the advent of the on-demand industry.\n\u201cI\u2019m glad that a leading candidate for President is talking about this issue,\u201d Warner told Re/code.\nWe spoke with Warner about the current relationship between the tech industry and Washington, what makes Uber\u2019s worker classification issue different from Walmart and whether a third class of worker would be a form of socialism.\n[Worker classification] could be an area of collaboration instead of conflict.\nHowever, no tech companies cracked his top twenty donors \u2014 those were mostly banks.)"}
