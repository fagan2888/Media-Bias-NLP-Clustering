Then he howls and grins and prepares to discuss the day\u2019s \u201coutright hypocrisy.\u201d\n\nIt is well entrenched in the McCain mythology that he finished nearly last (894th out of 900) in his class at the Naval Academy and never set out to be a great American hero, let alone a politician. He fell into the role \u2014 out of an airplane. Politics caught him. He ran for the House in 1982 and then the Senate in 1986. Even then, he conveyed a sense that he didn\u2019t need or especially want this job, but over the years he became essential to the scenery: the Sunday shows, the Senate fights, the high-level globe-trotting. The arena suited and needed and defined McCain. He often parks himself in a hallway at the Capitol and waits for reporters to surround him. He is proud to hold the record for most appearances \u2014 69 \u2014 in the 66-year history of \u201cMeet the Press\u201d and also to have more Twitter followers than anyone in the Senate (1.85 million badges of his relevance \u2014 nearly four times as many as the next Republican colleague, Marco Rubio). You can call this vanity, self-celebration, whatever \u2014 if it were a crime, the Capitol would be empty. But in McCain\u2019s case, it\u2019s also proof that he was present and accounted for, which is perhaps no small thing when you spent a good portion of your life expecting to die in a P.O.W. camp. In McCain\u2019s worldview, anonymity equals absence.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI think the biggest fear John has is not being relevant,\u201d Graham told me. \u201cHe worried after he lost the election in 2008. He worried, O.K., I\u2019m done, nobody wants to deal with a loser.\u201d McCain has a favorite line, one of his hundreds, which he attributes to the late Texas senator John Tower: \u201cDon\u2019t let your coattails hit you in the ass,\u201d Tower told him once. \u201cKeep moving.\u201d To McCain, \u201ckeep moving\u201d is both a credo and a coping strategy, a balm of perpetual motion and high demand. He likes to provide unprompted recitations of his packed schedule. I was sitting with him in his office in October, shortly after the government shutdown ended. He was, as he often is, fresh off a regimen of morning TV interviews \u2014 CNN, \u201cSquawk Box.\u201d \u201cI did a bunch last night too,\u201d he volunteered.\n\nEven when sitting still, McCain projects stir-craziness. Lengthy Senate hearings can be a challenge for him. He was recently busted in a photograph playing video poker on his iPhone during a hearing on Syria. (\u201cScandal!\u201d he tweeted. \u201cCaught playing iPhone game at 3+ hour Senate hearing \u2014 worst of all, I lost!\u201d)\n\nSometimes McCain will express his need to \u201ckeep moving\u201d with a more exasperated, even plaintive construction: \u201cCan\u2019t we just move on to something else?\u201d he will say, particularly when people ask him, as they still do, about Sarah Palin\u2019s continued presence on the national stage \u2014 or on Facebook. Friends and colleagues who respect him for his many virtues and heroic r\u00e9sum\u00e9 also acknowledge that his role in the unleashing of Palin is an unfortunate part of his legacy. Surely McCain regrets the association, right? He is a man of seriousness, someone who becomes emotional when talking about the need for a more aggressive United States presence in Syria. And then Palin hops onto Facebook and quips that the U.S. should just stay out of Syria and \u201cLet Allah sort it out.\u201d People close to him say that he bristles at these things and that he wishes Palin had consulted him about some of the endorsements she has made of Republican primary challengers but that he will never go public with any of his regrets. \u201cGood luck trying to get that out of him,\u201d his daughter Meghan McCain told me, laughing.\n\nMcCain has always been unrestrained in his expressions of remorse. He spent much of the 1990s doing extravagant penance for his role in the Keating Five savings-and-loan mess. This led to the reformed campaign-finance crusader incarnation, which led to his first presidential campaign. After dropping out of the Republican primaries in 2000, he returned to South Carolina and grandly apologized for not calling for the removal of the Confederate flag from the Statehouse. \u201cI chose to compromise my principles,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cI broke my promise to always tell the truth.\u201d When it comes to Palin, though, he fidgets slightly in his office chair and meets me with a defiant stare. He reaffirms his allegiance to Palin, saying that she was unfairly attacked in 2008 and that \u201cthe liberal-left feminists\u201d felt threatened by her. \u201cLook, it\u2019s been five years,\u201d McCain says. \u201cCan\u2019t we move on?\u201d\n\nSure, except that Ted Cruz, whose upset win in the Texas Republican primary last year was propelled by the former Alaska governor\u2019s endorsement, has not been shy about announcing to the world that \u201cI would not be in the U.S. Senate today if it were not for Sarah Palin.\u201d\n\nMcCain is sick of talking about Cruz. \u201cWe have a cordial relationship,\u201d he insists, which in the Google translation of political code is something between abject disgust and minimal tolerance. Cruz is an upstart, whose goal seems to be to position himself to run for president in 2016. He appears indifferent to the traditional markers of Senate experience and prestige \u2014 passing bills, leading committees, dutifully winning the respect of colleagues. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s a funny thing about Cruz,\u201d McCain says, and then stops himself. \u201cNo, actually, it\u2019s not funny. It aggravates me more than anything else\u201d \u2014 the way Cruz called his fellow Republicans a bunch of wimps and talks about \u201chow we\u2019ve been around too long.\u201d Cruz is the Senate\u2019s modern-day maverick, it would seem, while McCain has become one of the institution\u2019s fiercest traditionalists.\n\nWhen I read Cruz\u2019s quote about owing his success to Palin, McCain shrugs. Palin has suggested, too, that she might support Tea Party primary challengers to the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, in Kentucky and to Lindsey Graham in South Carolina, whom McCain has likened to a son. \u201cOh, I pray she wouldn\u2019t do that,\u201d he says of Graham. \u201cAnd you know, I find it hard to believe that she would.\u201d He points out that Palin has never said anything critical about him, that she campaigned in Arizona for him in 2010. And then he adds, again: \u201cI\u2019ve moved on. What\u2019s the statute of limitations on this issue?\u201d\n\nMcCain\u2019s cellphone rings, and it\u2019s Joe Lieberman, the former senator from Connecticut who was McCain\u2019s first choice to be his running mate in 2008, until his advisers convinced him that the Republican base would go full wacko bird if he picked a pro-choice Democrat. McCain answers the phone by saying, \u201cI love you, Joey.\u201d He speaks loudly, the way that people tend to on cellphones, or when they might be speaking for the benefit of a third party. \u201cJoey, Joey, where have you been?\u201d After a minute or so, he tells Joey he\u2019s with someone and will call him back.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cFunny story about Lieberman,\u201d he says to me. The Israeli ambassador in Washington honored him after he left the Senate. \u201cEveryone was saying Joe\u2019s the most wonderful guy, the usual crap you hear,\u201d McCain says. \u201cSo I got up, I was the last guy, and I say: \u2018I\u2019m here to announce that I\u2019m converting to Judaism. Because for all these years with Joe, I\u2019ve had to eat that crappy salmon. I had to ride the damn Shabbat elevator. I\u2019ve observed Shabbat to a point where I couldn\u2019t even ride in a goddamn car. I\u2019ve had all of the bull associated with this religion, and I\u2019ve gotten not a single benefit. So I\u2019m converting to Judaism.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLieberman then stood up and announced that before McCain could convert, he must first have a proper bris. In the retelling, McCain pronounces it \u201cbrits\u201d \u2014 which is how he pronounced it when he told me this story a week earlier.\n\nA few days later, I join McCain in Arizona, where he is scheduled to host two town meetings and is expecting hostile incoming from the local Tea Party brigades. After missing my flight to Phoenix, I caught the last plane of the night to the general vicinity (Las Vegas), then drove five hours through the pitch-black desert to meet up with McCain at dawn. Those five hours were filled with the sound of incessant grievance across the radio dial \u2014 about President Obama and about RINOs (Republicans in Name Only) like McCain, who are just as responsible for the socialist, lawless, porous-bordered dystopia our once-great nation has become. Captive exposure to these voices in the dark, over endless miles, makes you wonder how anyone to the left of Ted Cruz has ever been elected to anything. It also brings into relief how grueling it must be to oppose the most fervent sector of his own party. \u201cI\u2019m really not psyched about going back to Arizona to do another Tea Party election,\u201d Meghan McCain told me. \u201cI honestly don\u2019t know how much more of that I can hear.\u201d\n\nYet John McCain seems characteristically energized by the prospect \u2014 as evidenced by his recent barrages against the Tea Partiers. As disastrous as the shutdown was for their party, many Republicans in the Senate greeted the humiliation with glee, and McCain was a particularly ebullient leader of this \u201cI Told You So\u201d caucus. \u201cIt didn\u2019t take a goddamned rocket scientist to see how this was going to turn out,\u201d he said, and then switched metaphors. \u201cWhen the rainstorm came, we were all wearing cardboard shoes.\u201d\n\nHis first stop of the day in Arizona is an early-morning radio interview with a conservative host, Barry Young on KFYI in Phoenix. McCain eats a Sausage McMuffin in the passenger seat of an S.U.V. driven by an aide, Michelle Shipley, who at one point makes a wrong turn and has to spin around in a parking lot. As she gets us headed down the correct street, McCain exhales an exaggerated sigh. \u201cEvery once in a while a blind hog will unearth an acorn,\u201d he says. (Shipley giggles and seems not to mind being likened to a blind hog.)\n\nYoung\u2019s show is focused heavily on the disastrous rollout of Obamacare. He and his sidekick, Michele Larson, joke about calling the Obamacare 800 number and repeatedly play a busy signal over the air. McCain mentions that help with the law is available in 150 languages. \u201cI would like mine in Urdu,\u201d he says, and then he quotes Dana Milbank of The Washington Post, who compared the president\u2019s pitch for Obamacare with late-night ads for the Ginsu knife. \u201cIf you call within the next 20 minutes, you\u2019ll get 50 percent off!\u201d McCain says. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll lose weight!\u201d\n\nHe also has news of his own to make. He mentions to Young that he\u2019s thinking about running for re-election in 2016. This is a different message from the one he sent over the summer, when he said that he didn\u2019t want to be one of those old geezers hanging around the Capitol. He repeats this status update during a commercial to everyone in the studio. \u201cI\u2019m thinking about running again,\u201d he says, and makes eye contact with me to make sure I caught it. \u201cCouldn\u2019t we assume that you were considering this already?\u201d I ask. \u201cAren\u2019t you also thinking about retiring?\u201d McCain shrugs.\n\nBack on the air, Young asks if McCain has just said that he was considering another run for Senate.\n\n\u201cIf some wild-eyed journalist hears this and wants to run with it and says that John McCain has announced on the air that he may run for another term in the Senate \u2014 that would not be wrong?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThat would not be wrong,\u201d McCain says.\n\nI ask McCain if I can tweet the momentous information he has just relayed. He nods.\n\n\u201cJust so I\u2019m clear,\u201d I ask, \u201care you \u2018considering\u2019 running? Or can I say \u2018strongly considering\u2019 it?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am very much considering it,\u201d McCain says.\n\nThat settled, we get back in the car to cover about two hours of Interstate 10 between Phoenix and Tucson. Shipley is again driving \u2014 also texting and emailing, balancing her iPhone against the wheel with her leg at high speeds. This would seem hazardous both from a safety and a public-relations standpoint, but McCain doesn\u2019t seem to care at all. He even tells Shipley to tweet a few things for him while she drives \u2014 about how the town meetings would be \u201cspirited\u201d and so forth. He takes a phone call from Meghan and tells her that Jay Leno wants them to come on his show together in January; it will be a blast. He calls \u201cLindsey, my boy,\u201d and reads him a Wall Street Journal article about Saudi Arabia. Calls Tom Coburn, tells him he did a great job on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d a few days earlier. Calls Senator Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, one of his new favorites. After each call, McCain repeats the name of the person he was just talking to. He likes to advertise his friendships, cataloging the names of colleagues he is close to, whom he has been impressed with and whom \u201cwe take traveling with us\u201d \u2014 a reference to the Senate delegations he and Graham lead around the world. He prizes his role as ringleader and is fiercely selective about who gets to be part of the bipartisan \u201cgangs\u201d he is always organizing.\n\nColleagues approach him \u201cpretty much every day,\u201d he says, about joining the gangs. As with many things in politics, there is an element of middle-school cliquishness about this. I ask what happens if he does not want someone in his group. \u201cSometimes we just get together and don\u2019t tell anybody else,\u201d he says. Or, in the case of an international trip, they won\u2019t publicize it until they land in Ukraine or wherever.\n\nGestures seem to matter more to him than they used to \u2014 things that people say about him, compliments they pay. \u201cFor somebody who seems to be gruff, he\u2019s one of the most sensitive people I\u2019ve ever met,\u201d Graham told me of McCain. \u201cIn a good way and a bad way.\u201d McCain has many Washington friends \u2014 meaning he will promiscuously address people as \u201cmy friend\u201d or colleagues as \u201cmy good friend from Texas\u201d or whatever. (Cruz, naturally, tells me that he is \u201cproud to count John McCain as a friend.\u201d) But for as social an organism as McCain is, he puts up a forbidding barrier. \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as friends,\u201d he told me. \u201cThere\u2019s me and Joe and Lindsey, but it\u2019s rare. I can count on one hand the number of real friends I have, or maybe two hands.\u201d\n\nWhen he\u2019s not on the phone en route to Tucson, McCain keeps reading news headlines (\u201cSebelius calling in sick!\u201d) and emails aloud. He reads an item about a poll, just out, about how only 12 percent of Americans believe that the rollout of Obamacare has gone smoothly. \u201cJust goes to show you,\u201d McCain says, \u201cthat you can probably get 12 percent of Americans to say pigs can fly.\u201d He learns that Liz Cheney, waging a primary challenge in Wyoming against his colleague Mike Enzi, referred to McCain as a \u201cliberal,\u201d which sparks an animated commentary from McCain \u2014 not against Cheney but about Enzi: \u201cHave you seen that Geico ad?\u201d he says. \u201cMike Enzi looks exactly like the guy in that Geico ad. He talks like him too. It\u2019s the damnedest thing!\u201d\n\nWe enter the city limits of Tucson, which McCain notes is the birthplace \u201cof that singer who used to go out with Jerry Brown, \u2018Blue Bayou\u2019 \u201d \u2014 Linda Ronstadt. In the parking lot of the community center where the town meeting will be held, Shipley brushes McCain\u2019s hair and sprays on a ton of hair spray. \u201cWe might very well have some fireworks in here,\u201d McCain says again on the way into the town meeting. He has been priming me for a raucous assembly all morning. But the crowd inside is small and subdued: 47 people in the room \u2014 three of them babies, three cops, 14 staff people and a trickle of media. The questions are pro forma and polite. McCain trots out the paid-staff-and-blood-relatives line. He vows to keep \u201cdoing God\u2019s work in the city of Satan.\u201d He is back on the road in less than an hour and appears slightly deflated by the reception. He assures me things will be rowdier in Phoenix.\n\nTo pass the time on the drive back, I engage McCain in a game of hypothetical-question roulette: If he were a young man living in Arizona today, not a politician, would he register to vote as an Independent? \u201cI would think about it,\u201d he says, but then catches himself and reasserts his faith in \u201cthe party of Lincoln and Ronald Reagan.\u201d Would he consider supporting an Independent presidential candidate if Ted Cruz were the Republican nominee? \u201cNo, because I have to respect the process.\u201d Would he support his friend Hillary Clinton in a head to head against Cruz? \u201cI will support the Republican ticket,\u201d he says, then adds: \u201cWith all due respect, that is a foolish question, my friend.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Phoenix town meeting is also lightly attended \u2014 about 50 people \u2014 but does yield fireworks. One Tea Party guy hits McCain on immigration, and a sizable man who claims to have family in the Jordanian Army becomes volcanic on the subject of U.S. policy in Syria, then engages in a shouting match with a man across the room. He keeps accusing McCain of \u201cinsulting my intelligence,\u201d and McCain asks the man repeatedly, \u201cAre you done?\u201d He calls the man rude, which really sets him off, and a few security jumbos have to escort the guy out of the room. McCain solicits the next question as if nothing happened, but his face remains bright red, and he looks slightly shaken and very much alive.\n\nHe invites me to an actual arena that night: in Glendale, Ariz., where the Calgary Flames of the N.H.L. were in town to play the Phoenix Coyotes. This is not the most fabled rivalry in sports, but McCain says he will watch any sporting event (\u201cI\u2019d pay to see the Bedwetters play the Thumbsuckers\u201d). He is a big fan of the Coyotes. There are supposedly other Phoenix Coyote fans, too, though not many of them come to home games. McCain\u2019s 25-year-old son, Jimmy, drives us to the arena. Cindy McCain is in the front seat, and I\u2019m in back with the senator, who is desperate to hear the pregame show on the radio. Silence makes him nervous. He keeps barking out call numbers to Cindy, but no luck. He checks the Coyotes app to find information about the show (McCain talks incessantly about his new Coyotes app), and Cindy continues to hunt around the radio dial, except when she is bracing herself for a crash, which happens on three separate occasions during Jimmy\u2019s gun-and-slam death ride through the greater Phoenix sprawl. When we arrive, miraculously without incident, the McCains engage in a spirited debate about which parking lot to use. Jimmy takes a few wrong turns; Cindy tells him to slow down and asks why he\u2019s going this way or that way, until finally Jimmy snaps and says, \u201cMom, you make it seem like which parking-lot entrance is the most important thing in the world!\u201d In fact, it\u2019s not, he tells her. \u201cI had a woman almost OD in front of me at a strip club this afternoon. Now that\u2019s something serious.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy were you in a strip club this afternoon?\u201d Cindy asks. Jimmy says he was making a delivery for the family beer distributorship. The woman will be fine, Jimmy reports. His father chuckles in the back.\n\nThe arena is ringed with palm trees popping out of the concrete and named for a company I\u2019ve never heard of. Twenty minutes before face-off, the concourse is as placid as Penn Station on a Sunday morning. The celebrity politician walks a few feet ahead of the rest of us. He carries himself with a full and rightful expectation that people will recognize him, and he greets anyone that meets his glance. \u201cThank you for your service, senator,\u201d many say. He gets this a lot, he says, \u201cusually right before they unload on me.\u201d\n\nIn the elevator, we meet a big, handsome guy in a suit who looks like a hockey player and, sure enough, turns out to be an inactive member of the Flames. McCain asks him where he\u2019s from. Minnesota. \u201cWhere are you from?\u201d he asks McCain. \u201cOh, I\u2019m sort of from all over,\u201d McCain tells him. When the player gets off the elevator and I mention to McCain that the guy had no idea who he was, the senator seems slightly amused and even a bit disoriented. \u201cIt happens sometimes,\u201d he says.\n\nThe seats are about half filled, and the arena is quiet enough during the game to hear the players shouting to each other. Fans are periodically instructed to howl like Coyotes, which McCain does in the same way he greets Wolf Blitzer. The home-team Bedwetters beat the visiting Thumbsuckers 4-2, and McCain heads home happy, except when Cindy can\u2019t find the postgame show on the radio, and Jimmy is nearly killing us again.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve noticed, I never talk about my experiences in prison,\u201d McCain said to me on the Sunday after Thanksgiving. \u201cI\u2019ve known too many professional heroes in my life.\u201d We were speaking by phone after a weekend he spent at his vacation home in Sedona, and he was getting ready to leave on a weeklong tour of Libya and Saudi Arabia. He would be joined by two staff members but no Lindsey, no entourage and no other members of the Senate.\n\nFor as much as McCain\u2019s P.O.W. story has been told, the details never fail to astound: the two badly broken arms, a shattered knee and multiple gashes after parachuting from a shot-down plane into the hands of an enemy mob; how he received no treatment for his wounds for four days, his captors hanging him by his broken limbs and beating him repeatedly; how they offered to release McCain early because of his famous father (who was about to take over as commander of U.S. forces in the Pacific), but he refused to leave, not wanting to give his enemies a propaganda win or risk demoralizing his fellow prisoners.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn his book about five Naval Academy graduates, \u201cThe Nightingale\u2019s Song,\u201d the journalist Robert Timberg described what McCain looked like after two months of imprisonment \u2014 weighing less than 100 pounds, with collapsed cheeks and atrophied limbs. \u201cHis eyes, I\u2019ll never forget,\u201d McCain\u2019s cellmate, Bud Day, told Timberg. \u201cThey were bug-eyed like you see in those pictures from the Jewish concentration camps. His eyes were real popeyed like that.\u201d\n\nDay, a decorated fighter pilot, died in July at age 88. \u201cHe was the bravest man I ever knew,\u201d McCain said after his death. He and Day had notable disagreements over the years: Day was part of the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, who campaigned against John Kerry in the 2004 presidential campaign. McCain condemned the group for their attacks against Kerry. \u201cLike a lot of heroes, everything was black and white with Bud,\u201d he told me. \u201cThat\u2019s how you survive.\u201d\n\nIn captivity, McCain said many of his fellow P.O.W.s would search for omens that their release was imminent. \u201cPeople would say, \u2018Hey, there\u2019s a carrot in my soup, so that must mean we\u2019re going home,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cBud used to say to them: \u2018Right, guys. We\u2019ll be going home one day, but it sure as hell won\u2019t be because we found a carrot in the damn soup.\u2019 \u201d\n\nMcCain says he has learned forgiveness, which is essential to maintaining forward motion. \u201cHe seems to be thinking about his life,\u201d Meghan McCain told me. \u201cHe just said to me, \u2018I watched an interview with myself on CNN and thought, Who is that old man that\u2019s staring back at me on the TV?\u2019 \u201d McCain agrees that he is in a reflective mode. His friends are dying off and longtime colleagues are retiring, and he himself is weighing whether to run again. He fears growing too old in the Senate, as he believes many of his colleagues did \u2014 he mentions Robert Byrd and Strom Thurmond. But he has also spoken about his father and grandfather, decorated Navy men who both died not long after they retired. \u201cMy grandfather actually flew home from the peace-signing on the Missouri and died,\u201d McCain says. \u201cI have seen people age dramatically when they go into retirement.\u201d If he seeks re-election and wins, McCain would be 86 at the end of that term. He is in line to become chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee if Republicans win a majority next November.\n\nLast April, Harry Reid convened the Senate for a special lunch in the Kennedy Caucus Room to commemorate the 40th anniversary of McCain\u2019s release from prison. McCain appreciated the gesture immensely, and nearly every one of his colleagues was present. He spoke through tears at times and without notes. He talked about the kindness he encountered in prison as well as the cruelty. That was striking to the people there, but more so that he spoke about his experience at all. \u201cJohn told a lot of little poignant stories,\u201d Susan Collins of Maine told me. \u201cWhen John was tied up in such a painful position, he talked about the one guard who would loosen the bonds. He told the story of being out in the yard on Easter, and how one of the guards drew a little cross in the sand, just to acknowledge the holiday, and then rubbed it out so no one would get in trouble.\u201d Collins has spent more than a hundred hours on airplane trips with McCain, she says, and has never heard him tell these stories. \u201cThere was not a dry eye in the house,\u201d Ted Cruz told me. \u201cIt was extraordinary for everyone in that room, regardless of party or ideology.\u201d\n\nMcCain points out that he was 31 when he became a prisoner of war. He was a formed human being, he says, as opposed to someone like Bob Dole, who sustained crippling wounds in World War II at age 21. \u201cThat\u2019s obviously going to be a transformational experience,\u201d he said. \u201cFor me, prison was obviously a testing period, but certainly not something that changed me.\u201d He also made a point of reminding me that his \u201cperformance\u201d in prison was lacking. He did sign a confession, McCain noted. It followed sustained torture. \u201cYou think to yourself, If I get into a situation like that, they\u2019ll never get me down,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you know, they did. It took a lot of pain, but they did.\u201d He still feels shame over it, he said.\n\nI had a final meeting with McCain in his office last Wednesday. It was the day after Nelson Mandela\u2019s memorial, which McCain said he was invited to but \u201ccouldn\u2019t justify\u201d attending because there was too much going on in Washington. This could be construed as a slap at Cruz, who was the only senator who did attend. I asked him what he thought about Cruz going \u2014 trying to bait him, yes. (I was a blind hog seeking an acorn.) But McCain wasn\u2019t playing. \u201cWould it help you if I called Cruz a wacko bird again?\u201d he said. As the conversation veered to topics like jail soup, his own mortality and the death of yet another friend, McCain began jiggling his leg. \u201cIf you stay really busy, you don\u2019t get nostalgic,\u201d he told me earlier, and it felt as if that was what was happening now, that he was physically willing the introspection away. An aide was waiting with a bunch of logistical questions for McCain about a trip to Kiev he was scheduled to take in a few days. Across the Hill, John Kerry was about to brief a group of senators about Iran. When I asked McCain one final question about the aftermath of 2008, he said, \u201cYou find out who your friends are after something like that.\u201d He projected no bitterness, only the restlessness of someone who had another place to get to in a hurry. \u201cDo you mind if we walk?\u201d he asked.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "feature", "ptime": 20131218050008, "twitter": {"description": "The \u201cbrave maverick\u201d who became the \u201cbitter old man\u201d is now \u201clearning to let go.\u201d", "creator": "MarkLeibovich", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/22/magazine/john-mccain.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002605388"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "title": "How John McCain Turned His Clich\u00e9s Into Meaning", "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/12/22/magazine/22mccain1-THUMB/22mccain1-thumbLarge-v2.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/22/magazine/john-mccain.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002605388", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/22/magazine/john-mccain.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "magazine", "hdl_p": "How John McCain Turned His Clich\u00e9s Into Meaning", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/magazine/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Dec. 18, 2013", "edt": "NewYork", "keywords": "McCain  John,United States Politics and Government,Presidential Election of 2008,United States,Congress", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Mark Leibovich", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/12/22/magazine/22mccain1-THUMB/22mccain1-thumbLarge-v2.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "McCain, John", "slug": "mag-22mccain-t", "byl": "By MARK LEIBOVICH", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "The \u201cbrave maverick\u201d who became the \u201cbitter old man\u201d is now \u201clearning to let go.\u201d", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/12/22/magazine/22mccain1-THUMB/22mccain1-thumbStandard-v2.jpg", "description": "The \u201cbrave maverick\u201d who became the \u201cbitter old man\u201d is now \u201clearning to let go.\u201d", "CG": "magazine", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Dec. 18, 2013", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/l/mark_leibovich/index.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/magazine/index.html", "section": "Magazine", "modified": "2016-01-01", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/magazine/index.jsonp", "tag": "United States", "published": "2013-12-18", "section-taxonomy-id": "E57A148E-0CB9-4C02-966D-28B119710151"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "geo": "United States", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20160101123013, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/22/magazine/john-mccain.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/12/22/magazine/22mccain1-THUMB/22mccain1-THUMB-videoSixteenByNine600-v3.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The \u201cbrave maverick\u201d who became the \u201cbitter old man\u201d is now \u201clearning to let go.\u201d", "title": "How John McCain Turned His Clich\u00e9s Into Meaning"}, "pdate": 20131218, "des": "Presidential Election of 2008", "articleid": 100000002605388, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "How John McCain Turned His Clich\u00e9s Into Meaning", "PST": "News"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf174\"", "article_summary": "\u201cGood luck trying to get that out of him,\u201d his daughter Meghan McCain told me, laughing.\n\u201cYou know, it\u2019s a funny thing about Cruz,\u201d McCain says, and then stops himself.\n\u201cI honestly don\u2019t know how much more of that I can hear.\u201dYet John McCain seems characteristically energized by the prospect \u2014 as evidenced by his recent barrages against the Tea Partiers.\n\u201cSo I got up, I was the last guy, and I say: \u2018I\u2019m here to announce that I\u2019m converting to Judaism.\n\u201cJohn told a lot of little poignant stories,\u201d Susan Collins of Maine told me."}
