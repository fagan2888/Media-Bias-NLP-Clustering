But the government gave procrastinators until April 30 to get coverage; to qualify, they must attest that they first became aware of the tax penalty for having no coverage when they filed their 2014 taxes.\n\nThe extension applies to plans sold on the state's exchange, Covered California, and to those sold directly by insurance carriers.\n\nNote: Those who get in under the wire will still have to pay a penalty on their 2015 taxes for going without health insurance for part of the year. The amount will be pro-rated, based on the number of months the individual went without coverage.\n\nPolicies bought in the last two weeks of this month take effect on June 1.\n\nFinally, those who opt to go without health insurance for the entire year - and who don\u2019t have a legally valid exemption to do so - will face a tax penalty of either $395 or 2 percent of their income, whichever is greater.\n\nAn earlier version of this story stated the second enrollment period ended in mid-March. It ended in mid-February.", "article_metadata": {"author": "Southern California Public Radio", "og": {"site_name": "Southern California Public Radio", "description": "Those who get in under the extended deadline will still face a pro-rated 2015 tax penalty for only having coverage for part of the year.", "title": "Procrastinators have until April 30 to buy health insurance", "url": "http://www.scpr.org/news/2015/04/27/51264/procrastinators-have-until-april-30-to-buy-health/", "image": {"width": 1024, "identifier": "http://a.scpr.org/i/91e5002517dc07b9d7c0eacc3d83ffb1/81479-full.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 709}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "http://scpr.org", "description": "Member-supported public radio for Southern California.
