Joni Ernst\u2019s (R-IA) Roast and Ride over the weekend, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) was in North Carolina organizing his campaign in the state and meeting with party leaders.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nSen. Rand Paul (R-KY) wasn\u2019t in Iowa either, as he had events in New Hampshire. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush also skipped the Roast and Ride.\n\nAccording to the Raleigh News and Observer, Cruz needled Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio from afar, saying they \u201cdon\u2019t fit naturally into any bracket.\u201d\n\n\u201cEither or both could choose to come compete with me in the conservative bracket,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think that is likely. If you look at their records, look at the teams they have hired, if you look at the decisions they are making real-time in the campaign, I think both have decided to compete in the moderate bracket. Indeed, I think Walker and Rubio will become the chief moderate rivals for Jeb Bush in that bracket.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are couple of consequences of that,\u201d Cruz added. \u201cIt means those guys are going to spend millions of dollars tearing each other apart because first they have to win their own bracket, which is why you have seen those candidates taking shots at each other already.\u201d\n\nThe News and Observer reports Cruz admitted he won\u2019t win the moderate bracket. However, he said his campaign is picking up support from the moderate donors, hinting that electing a moderate Republican in 2016 \u201cis a path to electing Hillary Clinton president.\u201d\n\nCruz\u2019s decision to unload on Walker and Rubio might be the beginning of him opening a new aggressive level of campaigning. He\u2019s largely avoided throwing elbows among his fellow 2016 contenders until this point.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Cruz Fires At Walker and Rubio: They \u2018Don\u2019t Fit Naturally Into Any Bracket\u2019 Especially Conservatives", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Cruz Fires At Walker and Rubio: They \u2018Don\u2019t Fit Naturally Into Any Bracket\u2019 Especially Conservatives", "title": "Cruz Fires At Walker and Rubio: They \u2018Don\u2019t Fit Naturally Into Any Bracket\u2019 Especially Conservatives - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 647, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/06/GettyImages-475876916.jpg", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2015-06-08T12:03:38-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/06/08/cruz-fires-at-walker-and-rubio-they-dont-fit-naturally-into-any-bracket-especially-conservatives/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Cruz Fires At Walker and Rubio: They \u2018Don\u2019t Fit Naturally Into Any Bracket\u2019 Especially Conservatives", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/06/GettyImages-475876916.jpg", "title": "Cruz Fires At Walker and Rubio: They \u2018Don\u2019t Fit Naturally Into Any Bracket\u2019 Especially Conservatives - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Gov.
