ObamaCare exchange to get subsidies for its staffers?\n\nposted at 9:21 pm on May 7, 2015 by Allahpundit\n\nDynamite stuff from Brendan Bordelon at NRO. Remember the Grassley Amendment? That\u2019s the provision that ended up being tacked onto ObamaCare before it passed in 2010 requiring members of Congress and their staffs to sign up for coverage on an exchange. If the public had to live with this crappy law, Grassley and his supporters insisted, then their representatives should have to as well. Problem is, coverage from an exchange meant that members and higher-compensated staffers would no longer be eligible for the insurance subsidies they got under their previous government coverage. That\u2019s a big hit financially for an aide who\u2019s making, say, $95,000 per year but could be making many times that amount as a lobbyist. Fearful of a \u201cbrain drain\u201d on the Hill, Congress set to work trying to find a way to weasel out of Grassley\u2019s amendment and let staffers keep their subsidies. The solution, with White House support, was to have Congress register with the D.C. ObamaCare exchange as \u2026 a small business, which would by law allow the staffer to continue to receive his old subsidies. Problem is, a \u201csmall business\u201d is defined as one with fewer than 50 employees. That ain\u2019t Congress. So how on earth could they qualify?\n\nRead Bordelon\u2019s piece, which must be the first great suspense story ever told about a government insurance application. Here\u2019s a taste of what David Vitter, chairman of the Senate\u2019s Small Business Committee, found when he asked to see Congress\u2019s application to the D.C. exchange.\n\nThe application said Congress employed just 45 people. Names were faked; one employee was listed as \u201cFirst Last,\u201d another simply as \u201cCongress.\u201d To Small Business Committee chairman David Vitter, who has fought for years against the Obamacare exemption, it was clear that someone in Congress had falsified the document in order to make lawmakers and their staff eligible for taxpayer subsidies provided under the exchange for small-business employees. But until Vitter got a green light from the Small Business Committee to subpoena the unredacted application from the District of Columbia health exchange, it would be impossible to determine who in Congress gave it a stamp of approval.\n\nWho ordered the fraudulent health exchange application? The good news is, all it would take to subpoena the document is a majority vote of Vitter\u2019s committee \u2014 a committee controlled by Republicans, of course. The nine Democratic members all voted against the subpoena, naturally, but the 10 GOP members could simply outvote them and issue it. Except \u2026 that\u2019s not what happened. When Vitter asked committee member Rand Paul, scourge of ObamaCare and stalwart supporter of big-government accountability, if he\u2019d be voting for the subpoena, he received a mysterious thumbs down.\n\nSenior committee aides say that Rand Paul\u2019s staff didn\u2019t immediately reply to an e-mail requesting the senator\u2019s consent and, when they did, they refused to provide it. When Vitter attempted to set up a member-to-member meeting, his overtures were ignored or put off. Paul\u2019s policy staff refused to take a meeting. When Vitter tried to confront Paul on the Senate floor, they say, the Kentucky senator skirted the issue\u2026 \u201cThe answers he has given do not make sense,\u201d Cannon says of Paul. \u201cAnd when someone with his principles does something that is so obviously against his principles, and does not give an adequate explanation, you begin to think that politics is afoot. It would have to be someone very powerful that made him a powerful pitch \u2014 or threat \u2014 to keep him from doing this.\u201d\n\nRepublicans on the committee ended up voting 5-5 on the subpoena; combined with the nine Democratic no\u2019s, it was 5-14 against. According to Bordelon\u2019s sources, though, the only reason the GOP vote split evenly was because the Republican leadership wanted to provide Paul with cover in his opposition. So they twisted arms and got Mike Enzi, James Risch, Kelly Ayotte, and Deb Fischer to also vote no, allowing Paul to hide in a (small) crowd. \u201cThe amount of blood that McConnell and Paul spilled to prevent [the subpoena] from happening makes me wonder [if] maybe that isn\u2019t all that there is to it,\u201d one committee staffer told Bordelon. Read the rest, seriously.\n\nObvious question: Why would Paul allow himself to get wrapped up in this? He\u2019s running for president as the antidote to Washington business-as-usual, the sort of libertarian maverick who\u2019d never play slimy anti-transparency games with the establishment to keep taxpayer money flowing fraudulently to government workers \u2014 to pay for ObamaCare, no less. One theory is that it\u2019s his pal Mitch McConnell, not Paul himself, who wants to block the subpoena; McConnell needed votes on the committee so he called in a favor from Rand. But that makes no sense when you realize that the final vote was 5-14. McConnell could have freed Rand to vote yes and the subpoena still would have failed badly, 6-13. Paul voted no because he wanted to vote no. But why? And why would he do it knowing that Marco Rubio, his 2016 rival, is also a member of the committee and voted yes? If this story blows up, Rubio\u2019s going to club Paul relentlessly with it on the trail. I don\u2019t get it.\n\nBetween this and the Corker Iran-deal betrayal, the new Senate majority\u2019s off to a rip-roaring good start on \u201cgood governance,\u201d huh?\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "\u201cWe deserve to know who signed that application, because they are robbing taxpayers.\u201d", "title": "Must read: Is the Senate defrauding the D.C.
