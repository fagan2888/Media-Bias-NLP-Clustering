For the most part, it\u2019s been what I\u2019d expected to see at a massive gathering of conservative activists, politicians and media members \u2014 a lot of khakis; a lot of high heels; a lot of wrinkles; a lot of white hair; and a lot of red, white and blue. I was expecting to see more Rand Paul swag, I suppose, but in terms of visual surprises, that and Uncle Sam in Wonderland is about it.\n\nBut when it comes to the sounds of CPAC, that\u2019s a different story. I expected the soundtrack to be a collection of aged radio-rock classics from the glory years of the baby boomer era (AC/DC seems to be especially popular) and I expected to hear a round of applause whenever anything \u2014 and I mean anything \u2014 negative was said about Obamacare. What I didn\u2019t expect, however, was to hear so much talk about economic inequality. During CPAC\u2019s opening day, in fact, it was referenced, explicitly or implicitly, by one GOP heavyweight after another.\n\nAs someone who agrees with the president that (besides global warming) inequality is the \u201cdefining issue of our time,\u201d this was encouraging. If both parties are taking inequality seriously, maybe some of the less ideologically charged means to combat it, like increasing the earned-income tax credit or lowering the costs of higher education, might one day become law. Unfortunately, what was also revealed by one CPAC speaker after another is that Republican thinking on inequality is muddled, self-contradictory and, above all else, driven by political necessity rather than actual conviction.\n\nOne of the more obvious signs of how unserious Republicans are when it comes to inequality is their seeming inability to decide whether or not it even exists. Rep. Paul Ryan charged that the only reason Democrats were talking about inequality was because \u201cthey\u2019re out of ideas\u201d and \u201ccannot talk about economic growth.\u201d But just a few hours later, Gov. Chris Christie \u2014 who, like Ryan, is considered a possible future presidential candidate \u2014 declared with absolute certainty that \u201cWe don\u2019t have an inequality problem.\u201d The real issue is a lack of \u201copportunity,\u201d said Christie, who had pretended earlier to be speaking directly to President Obama, telling him \u201cno one cares about your opinion on inequality.\u201d\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, for his part, seemed to agree with Ryan. Although the powerful Kentucky Republican never actually said the word \u201cinequality,\u201d he assured CPAC\u2019s assembled conservatives that \u201cthe greatest con game\u201d in politics is the notion that redistribution \u201cis good for the little guy.\u201d Using language one would expect to hear at an Occupy reunion more than a right-wing confab, McConnell said that, because of liberalism, \u201cthe rich have gotten richer, the poor have gotten poorer, and the middle class is being squeezed like never before.\u201d McConnell even went so far as to say that he \u201ccan\u2019t stand\u201d the fact that \u201cnever before has it been so hard for the rich to become poor or for the poor to become rich.\u201d\n\nYet for every example of a conservative acknowledging that something is awry with the distribution of wealth in the U.S. \u2014 like when Sen. Ted Cruz lamented how \u201cWall Street prospers while Main Street suffers\u201d \u2014 there was another example of a conservative implying that the whole idea of inequality was bunk \u2014 like when Sen. Marco Rubio said the Democrat \u201calways tries to divide people\u201d by telling them \u201cthe reason why you\u2019re worse off is because someone else is doing too well.\u201d For every Sen. Mike Lee calling to \u201cend cronyist privilege and corporate welfare \u2026 and put America\u2019s political and corporate elites back to work for the rest of us,\u201d there was a National Review editor Rich Lowry calling the president\u2019s focus on inequality a \u201cnightmare\u201d that ran contrary to the spirit of Abraham Lincoln, the president with whom Obama is, in Lowry\u2019s telling, \u201cobsessed.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "From decrying the problem to praising it to ignoring it, the right is totally lost on how to talk to the 99 percent", "author": "Elias Isquith", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "From decrying the problem to praising it to ignoring it, the right is totally lost on how to talk to the 99 percent", "title": "Wingnuts baffled by inequality: Why they\u2019re totally confused about how to talk about it", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/03/08/wingnuts_baffled_by_inequality_why_theyre_totally_confused_about_how_to_talk_about_it/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/rubio_cruz_christie.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "From decrying the problem to praising it to ignoring it, the right is totally lost on how to talk to the 99 percent", "creator": "@eliasisquith", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/rubio_cruz_christie.jpg", "title": "Wingnuts baffled by inequality: Why they\u2019re totally confused about how to talk about it", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Wingnuts baffled by inequality: Why they\u2019re totally confused about how to talk about it", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Barack Obama, Chris Christie, Conservatives, CPAC, Editor's Picks, Inequality, Marco Rubio, Mitch McConnell, Paul Ryan, Ted Cruz, The Right", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8714\"", "article_summary": "As someone who agrees with the president that (besides global warming) inequality is the \u201cdefining issue of our time,\u201d this was encouraging.\nWhat I didn\u2019t expect, however, was to hear so much talk about economic inequality.\nRep.
