The Affordable Care Act is off to a rocky start. Even setting aside the court challenges and electoral battles, websites have crashed, deadlines have been delayed, and for employers, a key requirement to provide coverage has been pushed back or modified multiple times. Yet the ACA is still law, and regulators, insurers, and employers continue to implement it. While the ACA may not be well, it is certainly alive.

Youre probably focusing on near-term issues for the ACA: ensuring your coverage complies, youre offering it to the right people, and your IT department is ready.
