He came in weighing five pounds and is now a bit over eight pounds. At this point it appears he will make a full recovery but only time will show if that\u2019s possible. He\u2019ll be here for months to not only make sure his throat is clear but to also gain muscle strength in my eagle flight barn.\u201d\n\nIn fact so feisty is the young bird, which has been named Munchie, that Ahalt cautioned against anyone else doing the same.\n\n\u201cI want to thank Preston for caring enough to rescue this magnificent animal but warn everyone that what he did was extremely dangerous,\u201d Ahalt wrote in an e-mail to ICTMN. \u201cMunchie was so weak from starvation that he didn\u2019t cause much trouble but within a week of arriving here, and being fed, he became very aggressive. He is still that way, the most shown by any eagle I\u2019ve treated. I urge anyone who finds an injured or downed raptor, most especially eagles, to use great caution in approaching them.\u201d\n\nOnly touch an eagle if it is \u201cin extreme danger,\u201d she said, warning that once their talon has a grip, they will not let go, especially if you struggle. Even a grown man cannot loosen the bird\u2019s fierce grip, she said.\n\nPreston found the bird in his yard, outside Riverton, on July 31. He and his mother fed the eagle raw chicken and water while waiting for authorities. The bird was suffering from the disease frounce, its throat so clogged with bacteria that it was near death from starvation.\n\nRELATED: Golden Eagle Close to Death Rescued by 11-year-old Boy", "article_metadata": {"description": "The golden eagle rescued by 11-year-old Preston Olson earlier this month is bouncing back from his illness and is well on its way to making a full recovery.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/08/29/golden-eagle-rescued-11-year-old-boy-thriving-set-full-recovery-156648", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/golden_eagle_healing-ironside_bird_rescue-susan_ahalt.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Golden Eagle Rescued by 11-Year-Old Boy Is Thriving, Set for Full Recovery"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dc": {"title": "Golden Eagle Rescued by 11-Year-Old Boy Is Thriving, Set for Full Recovery"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/08/29/golden-eagle-rescued-11-year-old-boy-thriving-set-full-recovery-156648", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.creator": "theresa", "dcterms.date": "2014-08-29T10:30-04:00", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Golden Eagle, Rescue, animal rescue groups, Wyoming, Endangered", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 1}, "dcterms.title": "Golden Eagle Rescued by 11-Year-Old Boy Is Thriving, Set for Full Recovery"}, "article_summary": "The golden eagle rescued by 11-year-old Preston Olson earlier this month is bouncing back from his illness and is well on its way to making a full recovery.\nRELATED: Golden Eagle Close to Death Rescued by 11-year-old Boy\n\u201cHe is able to now swallow his food without help, no more tubing every six hours is necessary,\u201d wrote Susan Ahalt of Ironside Bird Rescue in Cody, Wyoming.\nAt this point it appears he will make a full recovery but only time will show if that\u2019s possible.\nThe bird was suffering from the disease frounce, its throat so clogged with bacteria that it was near death from starvation."}
