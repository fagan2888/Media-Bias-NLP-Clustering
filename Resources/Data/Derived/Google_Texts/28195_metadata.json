They monitor her every day.\u201d\n\nDuring the first weeks of her life, Sophie had surgery on her bowel in addition to undergoing blood transfusions. She also suffered a brain hemorrhage, an event that is common among premature babies with fragile brains.\n\n\u201cThe second day after she was born they actually let me hold her,\u201d Valeria told Fox 8 Cleveland. \u201cThey had to get a lamp to keep her warm and wrap me up and have her against me.\u201d\n\nSophie\u2019s doctor also described a technique used for preemie babies called Kangaroo Care to Fox 8. The method involves skin-to-skin contact with the baby and parent for as many hours as possible every day.\n\n\u201cOne of the biggest problems with having a preemie\u2014especially a hospitalized preemie\u2014is that [the parents] don\u2019t feel like parents; they feel like bystanders to their own child, so we\u2019ve been working incredibly hard to get rid of those walls between parents and babies,\u201d Dr. Edward Shepard told Fox 8.\n\nShepard says the method helps babies get better faster. Indeed, a recent study showed that babies born prematurely have a higher rate of survival than they did 20 years ago.\n\nCommitted to Sophie\u2019s health, Valerie and her husband Shawn have spent every day at the hospital since their daughter\u2019s birth.\n\nAn recent update says that Sophie is up to a weight of three pounds, five ounces.\n\nShe is currently gaining about one ounce per week and is on a ventilator \u201cfighting to stay strong.\u201d\n\n\u201c[The doctors] are working hard to get her weight up to 4 pounds so she can have the second part of surgery to put her bowels back together!\u201d Aunt Trish wrote on another GoFundMe page update. \u201cThey are also checking twice a week on her brain hemorrhage and so far so good!!\u201d\n\nSophie needs to weigh around five pounds before she can go home, according to the Mansfield News Journal.\n\nDoctors expect to release the baby in mid-December, around the time of her original due date.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A size five ring is almost as big as the hand of baby Sophia Reneigh Reynolds.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A size five ring is almost as big as the hand of baby Sophia Reneigh Reynolds.", "title": "Fighter Baby Born Weighing Just 1 Pound Makes Progress", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/feet.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-10-28T19:27:00+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/20aBATD"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A size five ring is almost as big as the hand of baby Sophia Reneigh Reynolds.", "title": "Fighter Baby Born Weighing Just 1 Pound Makes Progress", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/feet.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "Protecting Life", "published_time": "2015-10-28T15:07:29+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-28T19:27:00+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "baby, preemie, premature"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda364\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe second day after she was born they actually let me hold her,\u201d Valeria told Fox 8 Cleveland.\n\u201cNow it is up to the doctors to help baby Sophie grow.\u201dSophia or \u201cSophie,\u201d as her parents call her, was born on August 15, just 23 weeks into Valerie\u2019s pregnancy.\nBorn at one pound, two ounces, Sophia spent the first few months of her life in a hospital in Columbus, Ohio.\n\u201cShe\u2019s a little fighter and has got a long way to go yet,\u201d Gaubatz, who is Valerie Reynolds\u2019 sister, wrote.\nSophie is one of the smallest babies to be treated at Nationwide Children\u2019s Hospital in Columbus, according to Fox 8."}
