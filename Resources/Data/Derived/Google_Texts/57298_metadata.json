APhA has previously noted that this restriction has limited pharmacists\u2019 opportunities for participation in Part D MTM.\n\nThe agency will launch testing in five Part D regions beginning in 2017.\n\n\u2018Finding creative solutions\u2019\n\nCMS released a detailed report for all stand-alone individual market basic PDPs interested in participating in the demonstration. The report includes preliminary information about the model.\n\nKey elements that CMS outlined in the announcement are in line with strategies APhA has advocated for in order to provide greater value to MTM.\n\n\u201cFinding creative solutions to make Medicare Part D MTM more robust and more effective has been one of APhA's core goals in recent years. CMS\u2019s announcement promotes many of the strategies APhA has long advocated for, including better integrating MTM into patients\u2019 overall health care. CMS\u2019s initiative also aligns with the movement to value-based health care design,\u201d APhA Executive Vice President and CEO Thomas E. Menighan, BSPharm, MBA, ScD (Hon), FAPhA, said in a statement.\n\nCMS noted that a key element will be a \u201cprospective payment for more extensive MTM interventions that will be \u2018outside\u2019 of a plan\u2019s annual Part D bid, something APhA has long supported as well.\n\nCurrently, CMS requires Medicare Part D plan sponsors to account for MTM services as an administrative cost, which is included in the plan bid.\n\nThe model design will include individualized MTM strategies that could enhance the pharmacist\u2019s role. These include, but are not limited to, team-based care delivery models, greater reliance on local pharmacists to identify at-risk beneficiaries and compensate the pharmacist for providing targeted counseling and other MTM services, reliance on prescribers and beneficiaries (or their caregivers) to identify at-risk individuals and refer them for MTM services, and allowing prescribers to order medication histories or comprehensive medication reviews in advance of appointments.\n\nAligning incentives\n\nThe Medicare Modernization Act (MMA) of 2003, which created the Part D program, requires that every Part D plan offer an MTM program in its benefit structure as a quality improvement feature. But CMS recognizes that MTM programs in Part D have not been fully realized, and additional payment incentives and MTM regulatory flexibilities might better achieve the key goals of MTM.\n\nIn an analysis of the demonstration on the blog of the journal Health Affairs, Lawrence Kocot, JD, LLM, MPA, National Leader of the Center for Healthcare Regulatory Insight at KPMG, LLP, wrote that: \u201cProactive approaches to improve care for Part D beneficiaries are neither incentivized nor rewarded by the current MTM program; rather, the emphasis is on procedural processes tied to CMRs and TMRs in order to meet uniform compliance standards for all patients.\u201d\n\nCMS said better aligned financial incentives and flexibility for basic, standalone PDPs to test interventions could include increased reliance upon the pharmacist as a trusted community resource to ensure that targeted beneficiaries are taking their medications accurately and appropriately.\n\n\u201cCMS believes that pharmacists serve a vital role in ensuring that Medicare beneficiaries receive and properly use the prescription drugs upon which they rely,\u201d said CMS\u2019s spokesperson.\n\nCMS said that if the model is successful, plans that implement effective MTM programs will lower overall Medicare expenditures as well as improve patient outcomes. The agency said they expect applicants to propose multipronged MTM programs that target populations at high risk of medication-related issues with specific interventions and engagement strategies that are sensitive to different clinical, cultural, and socioeconomic characteristics of beneficiaries.\n\nAPhA is currently analyzing the announcement and plans to submit comments to CMS by the October 16 deadline.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "American Pharmacists Association", "description": "CMS wants to unlock the potential of medication therapy management (MTM) through a new demonstration project that the CMS Center for Medicare & Medicaid Innovation (CMMI)", "title": "CMS unveils model to improve MTM in Medicare Part D", "url": "http://www.pharmacist.com/cms-unveils-model-improve-mtm-medicare-part-d", "image": "/sites/default/files/images/APhA-footer-logo.png", "updated_time": "2015-10-21T09:16:15-04:00", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-06T10:02:36-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-21T09:16:15-04:00"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "CMS wants to unlock the potential of medication therapy management (MTM) through a new demonstration project that the CMS Center for Medicare & Medicaid Innovation (CMMI)", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce028\"", "article_summary": "CMS said that if the model is successful, plans that implement effective MTM programs will lower overall Medicare expenditures as well as improve patient outcomes.\n\u201cBy removing disincentives to invest in their MTM programs, CMS is encouraging plans to \u2018right-size\u2019 their spending on MTM strategies, including services provided by pharmacists,\u201d a CMS spokesperson told Pharmacy Today.\n\u201cFinding creative solutions to make Medicare Part D MTM more robust and more effective has been one of APhA's core goals in recent years.\nBut CMS recognizes that MTM programs in Part D have not been fully realized, and additional payment incentives and MTM regulatory flexibilities might better achieve the key goals of MTM.\nAPhA has previously noted that this restriction has limited pharmacists\u2019 opportunities for participation in Part D MTM."}
