Small businesses and Affordable Care A year later, ChemicoMays CEO sees Affordable Care Act as a positive

At the end of last year, ChemicoMays LLC President and CEO Leon Richardson told Crain's it was too early to jump to conclusions on the Affordable Care Act and that he might have a different opinion after another year.



So a year later, we called him to see where his thoughts are.



"It's really been a positive so far," said Richardson. "It's adding value to the lives of employees by giving health care access to those that may not have had it in the past."



ChemicoMays has 310 employees and is expected to reach $110 million in revenue this year. Last year's revenue was $96 million.



Before the ACA came into effect, ChemicoMays offered employees one health care plan option. Now, the Southfield-based company has three. Employees can choose plans starting at a cost of $15 every other week for a high-deductible health care plan and $101.28 every other week for the lowest deductible plan.
