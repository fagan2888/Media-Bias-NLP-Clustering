States like Kentucky and North Dakota, which rely heavily on coal, saw their required emissions reduction targets jump by as much as 22 percent. Other states that have implemented more clean energy policies saw their requirements get slashed \u2013 in Idaho\u2019s case by nearly two-thirds.\n\n\u201cThe new mix of targets is far easier to defend as equitable\u2014which of necessity means it is much harsher on states that have done less to move toward carbon efficient energy production to date,\u201d said Wallach.\n\nNot everyone shares Wallach\u2019s view, unsurprisingly.\n\nRelated: The High Cost of Climate Change \u2013 Wildfires Burn through the Forests Service Budget\n\nThe American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, a group supported by the coal industry, has been attacking the rule as an assault on consumers that could cost, it claims, up to $41 billion in increased electricity prices and would have \u201cvirtually no effect on climate change.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith the release of the final carbon regulation, the President once again demonstrated his lack of empathy for hard working Americans across the country who first and foremost wish to secure a robust economic future,\u201d the ACCCE said in a release. \u201cInstead of putting their priorities first, the President shamefully put his political legacy first.\u201d\n\nAs of Thursday, 16 states had come together to ask the Environmental Protection Agency to stay enforcement of the rule until a lawsuit they plan to bring in challenge to the rule is settled. The states participating are Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Nebraska, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Utah, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming. Others may join.\n\n\u201cThis request is a necessary first step and prerequisite to confronting this illegal power grab. These regulations, if allowed to proceed, will do serious harm to West Virginia and the U.S. economy and that is why we are taking quick action to bring this process to a halt,\u201d said West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The Obama administration\u2019s new Clean Energy Plan is under assault by 16 states\u2019 attorneys general.
