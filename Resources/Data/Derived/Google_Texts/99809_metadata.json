Some major tech players, however, are trying to change that scenario.\n\nMedical professionals face a growing need to be able to quickly and safely share patient information as old \u201chard copy\u201d records systems become outdated.\n\nIn addition, patients want to be more involved in their own health care with fitness devices and other ways of monitoring and maintaining general well-being as well as chronic conditions like diabetes and heart disease.\n\nRegulations Galore\n\nDespite the value and revenue-enhancement potential of modernizing healthcare systems and operations in the U.S., the use of technology in the medical field comes with some major cautions.\n\nSafeguarding data and ensuring the reliability of equipment involves compliance with complicated rules and regulations, not to mention adhering to requirements of the Affordable Care Act, Food and Drug Administration, Medicare and various other agencies.\n\nEnter Major Tech\n\nThe tech companies best equipped to handle the maze of red tape and complicated regulations are the ones most used to dealing with privacy and compliance on the technology side and on the Internet.\n\nHere are three large entities that have already made strides to enter what may become the \u201cnext big thing\u201d for healthcare tech.\n\n1) Apple\n\nApple (AAPL) has had its eye on the healthcare industry for some time. This became apparent when the company announced its HealthKit services as part of iOS 8. HealthKit lets developers coordinate various fitness and health-related apps.\n\nThe company was also said to be in talks with health care providers in the U.S., including Mount Sinai, the Cleveland Clinic and Johns Hopkins, about making certain types of data like blood pressure, pulse and weight available for both consumers and medical professionals all in one place.\n\n2) Google\n\nAndroid is not taking a back seat to iOS in the rush to health care involvement. Google (GOOG) announced last week the roll-out of its new healthcare app development kit, designed to help software developers build a number of digital medical tools.\n\nGoogle has also made headlines with news of its efforts to develop a contact lens system that would allow diabetics to monitor their glucose levels without drawing blood. Once perfected, the contact lens system would not only eliminate the inconvenience of the daily \u201cfinger prick\u201d ritual, but would also allow for constant, non-invasive monitoring, leading to better blood sugar control, and therefore better health for the nation\u2019s diabetics.\n\n3) IBM\n\nMost notable among IBM\u2019s (IBM) attempts to enter the field of medicine and healthcare has been use of the company\u2019s Watson supercomputer for diagnosis and evaluation of patient information.\n\nIn basic terms, Watson becomes an incredibly intelligent assistant, capable of handling massive amounts of data, offering diagnoses and suggesting treatment options for any number of illnesses, including cancer.\n\nA recently announced partnership between IBM and Apple calls for IBM to construct a suite of platforms and apps that allow for safe handling of healthcare data between and among medical professionals, patients and electronic health care records.\n\nAt the time of this writing, Jim Probasco had no position in any mentioned securities.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Market Headlines,Technology;Business;Stocks", "og": {"url": "http://www.nasdaq.com/article/3-major-tech-companies-breaking-into-health-care-cm382234", "site_name": "NASDAQ.com", "image": "http://www.nasdaq.com/images/dreamit.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "3 Major Tech Companies Breaking Into Health Care"}, "Robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "nasdaq news, market headlines, market news, stock market headlines, stock market news", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-20T01:35:52-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width", "description": "Jim Probasco, Benzinga Staff WriterFor years, rows of folders filled with patient medical records have been a familiar sight in doctor\u2019s offices,."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd169a\"", "article_summary": "2) GoogleAndroid is not taking a back seat to iOS in the rush to health care involvement.\nIn addition, patients want to be more involved in their own health care with fitness devices and other ways of monitoring and maintaining general well-being as well as chronic conditions like diabetes and heart disease.\nJim Probasco, Benzinga Staff WriterFor years, rows of folders filled with patient medical records have been a familiar sight in doctor\u2019s offices, hospitals and clinics.\nMedical professionals face a growing need to be able to quickly and safely share patient information as old \u201chard copy\u201d records systems become outdated.\nA recently announced partnership between IBM and Apple calls for IBM to construct a suite of platforms and apps that allow for safe handling of healthcare data between and among medical professionals, patients and electronic health care records."}
