While the state\u2019s economy is relatively strong, most of that growth didn\u2019t come from new residents moving in, the Census found in new population estimates released this week.\n\nUtah still has the nation\u2019s highest birth rate and its youngest median age. About 90 percent of this year\u2019s increase came from so-called natural growth, or having more births than deaths. Net migration to the state totaled just over 4,000 people.\n\nThat\u2019s the opposite of what most residents assume, said Robert Grow, head of Envision Utah, a group working with Gov. Gary Herbert to plan for future growth.\n\n\u201cI used to tell people, if you don\u2019t like the growth and you want to see the culprit, go home and look in the mirror,\u201d Grow told The Salt Lake Tribune (http://bit.ly/1zz5pSg).\n\nWhen residents assume the growth is caused by new people moving in, they don\u2019t feel as committed to handling the challenges that a burgeoning population brings, he said. Growth looks like it will be on the agenda for years to come: Utah is on track to nearly double its current population of 2.9 million people by the year 2050.\n\nAnd some wonder whether the Census estimates covering July 2013 through July 2014 lowballed the number of people moving into the state.\n\nNatalie Gochnour, associate dean of the University of Utah\u2019s business school, called the figures perplexing. Most of the people moving to Utah came from outside the country, while within the U.S., more people actually left the state than came in, the Census found.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not what we would expect given our economic growth,\u201d Gochnour said, adding that the Census estimates could later be revised.\n\nThe migration counts include people leaving for Mormon missions. This year, more young members of the Utah-based Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints went on missions after the church lowered its age requirements, Grow said.\n\nUtah\u2019s population grew by 1.4 percent over the last year, nearly double the national growth rate of 0.75 percent, the report found. It was the 8th fastest growing state in the country.\n\nThe country\u2019s birth rate has been dropping in recent years, partly as people delay having children amid the lackluster recovery from the economic recession, said Pam Perlich, senior research economist at the University of Utah.\n\nThat\u2019s been true in Utah as well, but it\u2019s less pronounced, she said.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Salt Lake Tribune, http://www.sltrib.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Utah's population grew nearly twice as fast as the rest of the country over the last year, primarily because of the state's high birth rate, according to a new report from the U.S. Census.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/dec/25/utahs-population-growth-outstrips-national-average/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "Utah\u2019s population grew nearly twice as fast as the rest of the country over the last year, primarily because of the state\u2019s high birth rate, according to a new report from the U.S. Census.", "title": "Utah\u2019s population growth outstrips national average"}, "twitter": {"description": "Utah's population grew nearly twice as fast as the rest of the country over the last year, primarily because of the state's high birth rate, according to a new report from the U.S. Census.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Utah\u2019s population growth outstrips national average"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdaff4\"", "article_summary": "Utah\u2019s population grew by 1.4 percent over the last year, nearly double the national growth rate of 0.75 percent, the report found.\nWhile the state\u2019s economy is relatively strong, most of that growth didn\u2019t come from new residents moving in, the Census found in new population estimates released this week.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not what we would expect given our economic growth,\u201d Gochnour said, adding that the Census estimates could later be revised.\nAbout 90 percent of this year\u2019s increase came from so-called natural growth, or having more births than deaths.\nWhen residents assume the growth is caused by new people moving in, they don\u2019t feel as committed to handling the challenges that a burgeoning population brings, he said."}
