Tunisian President Moncef Marzouki and outgoing Assembly chief Mustapha Ben Jaafar signed the document on Monday morning, bringing it into effect.\n\nWith its new constitution, Tunisia, the starting place of the massive protests that swept Western Asia and North Africa in 2011, manages in some ways to surpass even the United States in terms of enshrining progressive ideals. According to the most recent unofficial draft available in English, the government takes on responsibilities that the U.S. government has had to struggle to provide. Most of these principles are laid out in a Chapter 2 of the constitution, a section titled \u201cRights and Liberties\u201d in the translation, which lays out 29 areas that the Tunisian state must provide for the betterment of the people \u2014 both now and in the future. Here are three highlights that showcase some of the most progressive of these guarantees:\n\n1. Climate change Given the conservative attempts to shut down the Environmental Protection Agency and deny the very existence of climate change, it would seem improbable at best that the U.S. will mention conservation efforts in the Constitution anytime soon. But Tunisia has done just that. \u201cContribution to a sound climate and the right to a sound and balanced environment shall be guaranteed,\u201d the constitution promises. \u201cThe state shall provide the necessary means to eliminate environmental pollution.\u201d Given Tunisia\u2019s location in the Maghreb, with portions of the country within the Sahara Desert, the state also is given custody over ensuring the \u201cconservation and rational use of water\u201d as one of its duties. 2. Health care Health care policy-making in Tunisia\u2019s capital of Tunis has also managed to leapfrog that in Washington as of Monday. \u201cHealth is a right for every person,\u201d the document announces, declaring that Tunisia shall \u201cguarantee preventative health care and treatment for every citizen and provide the means necessary to ensure the safety and good quality of health services.\u201d Even as the U.S. begins to implement the Affordable Care Act, and Republican governors block the implementation of the portions that expand Medicaid, the new Tunisian constitution promises \u201cfree health care for those without support and those with limited income.\u201d 3. Women\u2019s rights The new constitution also goes further than the American version in explicitly promoting women\u2019s rights, a goal of the now-dormant push to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment. \u201cThe State shall commit to protecting women\u2019s achieved rights and seek to support and develop them,\u201d the constitution reads. \u201cThe State shall guarantee equal opportunities between men and women in the bearing of all the various responsibilities in all fields.\u201d The draft version also committed the government to try to balance the number of men and women serving in elected councils, which would far outstrip the current 82-17 split between the two in the U.S. Congress last year. Given the struggle to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act in the United States last year, it would seem that Tunisia has American beat there as well. \u201cThe state shall the necessary measures to eliminate violence against women,\u201d the constitution guarantees. 4. Workers\u2019 rights Tunisia\u2019s laborers get a huge boost under the new constitution, particularly in comparison to their American counterparts. Under the terms of the document, the right to form trade unions in guaranteed along with all of the powers that grants laborers \u2014 including the ability to strike. Members of the army and security services are the one exception to this rule, while unions and all other political parties and associations are required to reject violence and abide by all areas of the law. The constitution also promises that all citizens, male and female alike, shall \u201chave the right to adequate working conditions and to a fair wage.\u201d As the debate over raising the minimum wage kicks off anew in the U.S. \u2014 and women are still paid far less than their male counterparts for similar jobs \u2014 the Tunisian guarantees look almost idyllic.\n\nMonday\u2019s approval came after a final reading of the draft, with all of the articles having been separately approved over recent weeks in a slew of compromise between the ruling Enhadda party and the opposition within the Assembly. As part of the deals made, the Government will step down in favor of a technocratic caretaker government which will be in place until elections can be held later this year. Islamist parties were also forced to agree to have Islam be the listed religion of the country, but to not promote sharia as the basis for future laws.\n\n\u201cThis constitution was the dream of Tunisians, this constitution is proof of the revival of the revolution, this constitution creates a democratic civil nation,\u201d Assembly chief Mustapha Ben Jaafar said after the votes were tallied.\n\nThe approval of the constitution marks the latest step towards the vision that revolutionaries set out following the toppling of longtime rule Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali three years ago. Since then, other countries have followed Tunisia\u2019s lead with less success to date. While Tunisia was celebrating its new legal framework, the Supreme Council of Armed Forces in Egypt endorsed the recently promoted military leader Field Marshal Abdel-Fattah El-Sissi as a candidate to run for president, after the army removed Muslim Brotherhood-backed president Mohammed Morsi last yer. Libya and Yemen are still struggling to provide security after the ouster of their long-time leaders, while Syria\u2019s opposition and government are still in open armed conflict with each other even as peace talks take place in Geneva.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Three years after the Arab Uprisings,Tunisia has come up with a constitution more progressive in many ways than the United States.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Three years after the Arab Uprisings,Tunisia has come up with a constitution more progressive in many ways than the United States.", "title": "4 Ways Tunisia Is Now More Progressive Than The United States", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/security/2014/01/27/3206701/4-ways-tunisia-progressive-america/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/AP559170567276.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Three years after the Arab Uprisings,Tunisia has come up with a constitution more progressive in many ways than the United States.", "creator": "@HayesBrown", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/AP559170567276-321x214.jpg", "title": "4 Ways Tunisia Is Now More Progressive Than The United States", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-security", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/AP559170567276.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/AP559170567276.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-27T11:18:48+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdaa91\"", "article_summary": "Health care Health care policy-making in Tunisia\u2019s capital of Tunis has also managed to leapfrog that in Washington as of Monday.\nWith its new constitution, Tunisia, the starting place of the massive protests that swept Western Asia and North Africa in 2011, manages in some ways to surpass even the United States in terms of enshrining progressive ideals.\nGiven the struggle to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act in the United States last year, it would seem that Tunisia has American beat there as well.\n\u201cThe State shall commit to protecting women\u2019s achieved rights and seek to support and develop them,\u201d the constitution reads.\n\u201cThe state shall the necessary measures to eliminate violence against women,\u201d the constitution guarantees."}
