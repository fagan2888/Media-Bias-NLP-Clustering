It was a spring drill allowing Civil War re-enactors -- and Malay's supporters -- to prepare for a busy summer season.\n\nWhile they gave history lessons to visitors, Malay explained the mission of the Camp Kane Heritage Foundation.\n\n\"We've got a whole lot more energy going at this thing,\" said Malay, who left her Civil War-era wardrobe at home Saturday.\n\nAs the foundation's president, Malay will help launch a fundraising drive for an ambitious, long-awaited plan: Bringing an outdoor education center, memorial and rebuilt Farnsworth mansion to Camp Kane.\n\nPresident Abraham Lincoln commissioned John Farnsworth to head the calvary, and his former home on what is now Route 31 is currently dismantled in storage, Malay said. The foundation wants to convert it into a Civil War and Underground Railroad museum.\n\nTheir goal is memorializing the past, but also what the \"community was founded on,\" she said.\n\n\"If you don't understand your history, you don't understand the good and the bad of that history, you tend to make the same mistakes over,\" Malay said.\n\nBob Johnson, a former history teacher who works with the foundation, envisions the grounds as the southern gateway to St. Charles.\n\n\"I don't know if it was the honor or the glory or what it was, but I've just always been fascinated by the Civil War,\" the Batavia man said.\n\nHis is an expensive hobby. His rifle alone, a Sharp carbine, costs about $800. Fellow re-enactors in the 8th Regiment of Illinois Volunteer Cavalry get their wool uniforms from sutlers -- traveling salesmen who followed the armies -- online or at big re-enactments.\n\n\"Everybody thinks I'm making 'Star Wars' jokes,\" said Colin John Fagan, another re-enactor, as he pulled out his light saber.\n\nFagan stood guard over the camp's rations -- coffee, cured meats, breads, spices. He says he strives for authenticity to teach spectators about the sacrifices of war.\n\n\"It's not just these generals moving pieces around on a chessboard,\" the Riverside man said. \"It's actually live men and women that are out there doing the fighting.\"\n\nSaturday's drill wasn't too solemn, though, with re-enactors like Brian Mensching praising the city for dedicating the site as Camp Kane last fall. Now, only the upper portion is called Langum Park.\n\n\"That's what we're celebrating today,\" he said.\n\nThe re-enactors will return to Naper Settlement's Civil War Days May 16-17 in Naperville.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Some 153 years after Camp Kane's opening along the Fox River, the mounted troops were back Saturday, firing black powder out of rifles and pitching camp in St. Charles.
