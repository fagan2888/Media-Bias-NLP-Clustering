(Photo: AP)\n\nIn response to your paper\u2019s articles regarding Gov. Snyder\u2019s appearance on Fortune Magazine\u2019s poll of the \u201cWorld\u2019s Most Disappointing Leaders.\u201d (Note: the magazine called it an \u201cunscientific\u201d online poll. What exactly does that mean? Hearsay?)\n\nIf anyone belongs at the top of the Fortune poll, it should be Barack Hussein Obama \u2026 the most disappointing president ever. The following is a list of his disappointments (or crimes). He managed an unprecedented tripling of America\u2019s debt (now critical and impossible to repay). He remained silent after his secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, let four heroes get murdered in Benghazi. Silent again after Hillary recently compromised American national security. He made a catastrophic nuclear \u201cdeal\u201d with Iran that could trigger an atomic doomsday. He has weakened our military so much that a third world country captured a U.S. ship and humiliated our once-proud Navy. He released four \u201cGitmo\u201d killers in exchange for a traitor. He and his puppet staff won\u2019t refer to Muslim terrorist killers as Muslim terrorists! He is viewed as a buffoon and the U.S. as \u201climp-wristed\u201d among global leaders. He stood by his pal, Sharpton, blamed police and defended thugs while a city burned. He shows total disregard for our Constitution.\n\nMore disappointments? How about the Obamacare fiasco, or his nonexistent immigration reform permitting illegals and drug traffickers to swarm over our boarders, or his anti-U.S. energy self-reliance and anti-business stance, or a mismanaged welfare system resulting in a huge increased of welfare recipients?\n\nLet\u2019s not forget past disappointments including IRS corruption, FBI corruption and VA corruption.\n\nThis \u201cscientific\u201d list is the tip of the disappointment iceberg. Obama and his administration belong, forever enshrined, at the top of the Fortune \u201cWorld\u2019s Most Disappointing Leaders\u201d list.\n\nPaul C.
