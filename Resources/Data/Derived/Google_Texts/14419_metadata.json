The nuns paid $1,500 to rent a booth in the exhibition hall, hoping to raise the profile of the Dominican Order and attract younger novices. Collectively, the Benincasa trio has belonged to the order for more than 150 years.\n\nREAD: A funny thing happened in that Joke with the Pope contest \u2026\n\nIn all, the auction for both of Thul\u2019s pastel art works \u2014 the larger one featured a half-dozen depictions of Pope Francis; the smaller one depicted him surrounded by swirls of light \u2014 raised less than $500.\n\nThe nuns still have plenty of matted prints available for $15 to $40 each at their gift shop.\n\nThe sisters aren\u2019t the only ones with leftover pontiff merchandise. Since his 2013 election, the pope has entered the consumer imagination through thong underwear, dog hoodies and cellphone cases.\n\nEven though the pope\u2019s whirlwind U.S. tour is over, Zazzle.com still offers more than 10,500 keepsakes. Etsy.com has more than 1,000. Cafepress.com advertises more than 500. And few are actually on sale.\n\nMichael Tandarich of Kennett Square, Pa., said he\u2019s still selling a few designs of his $19.95 T-shirts on his popefrancisphiladelphia.com website. Most popular was a pope-themed Love Park shirt. Least popular was a canary-yellow shirt with an outline of the pontiff. Part of the proceeds were donated to local churches and Catholic charities.\n\n\u201cWe found that a lot of people took our designs and were selling them themselves,\u201d Tandarich said in an email.\n\nThe business sold more than 300 shirts, which was fine with Tandarich, who wanted to test some marketing ideas and \u201cdidn\u2019t have any expectations.\u201d\n\nREAD: Diana Butler Bass grounds herself in nature and finds God\n\nSimilarly, the nuns aren\u2019t dwelling on the negative.\n\nSister Mary Columba Brienza tried to attend the pontiff\u2019s public Mass on the Benjamin Franklin Parkway on Sept. 27, but couldn\u2019t pass through security in time. Watching him on the Jumbotron, she marveled at how he quieted the crowd with a message of tolerance and economic justice that crosses all faiths.\n\n\u201cI saw these people fixed on that man in white and it was so beautiful,\u201d she said. \u201cHe brings people together and makes us realize that we\u2019re brothers and sisters.\u201d\n\n(Fishman reports for The News Journal in Wilmington, Del.)", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Beliefs, Culture, Institutions, Catholic, Christian, nuns, papal visit, Philadelphia, Pope Francis, souvenirs", "generator": "Easy Digital Downloads v2.5.16", "og": {"site_name": "Religion News Service", "description": "Pope Francis' visit to Philadelphia was a boon to their spirits but the New Castle, Del., nuns -- and other entrepreneurs as well -- were disappointed with souvenir sales.", "title": "Pope portraits bedevil cash-strapped nuns", "url": "http://religionnews.com/2015/10/09/pope-francis-nuns-philadelphia/", "image": "http://religionnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/NUN-PORTRAIT-Sister-Mary-Grace-Thul-.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@RNS", "card": "summary"}, "syndication-source": "http://religionnews.com/2015/10/09/pope-francis-nuns-philadelphia/", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://religionnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-RNS_logo_RGB-336x336.gif", "original-source": "http://religionnews.com/2015/10/09/pope-francis-nuns-philadelphia/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "Pope Francis' visit to Philadelphia was a boon to their spirits but the New Castle, Del., nuns -- and other entrepreneurs as well -- were disappointed with souvenir sales."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca080\"", "article_summary": "WILMINGTON \u2014 The New Castle nuns who tried to draw attention to their tiny order by raffling off original portraits of Pope Francis last month fell short of their goal.\nSince his 2013 election, the pope has entered the consumer imagination through thong underwear, dog hoodies and cellphone cases.\nThe nuns paid $1,500 to rent a booth in the exhibition hall, hoping to raise the profile of the Dominican Order and attract younger novices.\nThe nuns still have plenty of matted prints available for $15 to $40 each at their gift shop.\n\u201cIf it was a money-making enterprise, it was an absolute failure,\u201d Sister Emmanuella Handlos, one of three nuns at Caterina Benincasa Monastery, said this week."}
