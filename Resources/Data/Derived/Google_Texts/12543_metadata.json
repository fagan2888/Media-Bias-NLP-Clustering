As part of our ongoing series of first-person health profiles called \u201cWhat\u2019s Your Story?\u201d 69-year-old Fred Smith talks about living in his RV after being a software engineer in Silicon Valley for nearly thirty years. Smith gives us a tour of his home.\n\nBy Fred Smith\n\nIt\u2019s an \u201985 Winnebago, Chieftain. And there\u2019s clothes and books, and those are pictures of my wife.\n\nWe\u2019re in the bedroom right now and it\u2019s a decent sized queen bed, I guess you\u2019d call it. Actually, it\u2019s a better bed than a lot of people have.\n\nBack in 2003, I was doing well, getting $145,000 a year. Then I got caught in the tail end of the dot-com crash and never recovered from that. Unemployment had ran out and I realized that I couldn\u2019t afford to keep the apartment I had. Actually, I ended up living in my car with my cat for a couple weeks here in the alley behind Happy Donuts. You know, you got these seats that fold down, and you\u2019re half in the trunk and half in the back seat.\n\nI took what money I had and borrowed some money from a friend and bought an old RV. But living in a RV, call it stressful, because you\u2019re always alert. You know, every once in a while you get woken up in the middle of the night by cops. If they chase me away from here, I\u2019ll go there, if they chase me away from there, I\u2019ll go there, then I\u2019ll come back to the original place. There\u2019s no place to go. And you check into affording housing, there isn\u2019t much of anything. And the waiting\u2026 I\u2019m on waiting lists.\n\nI really don\u2019t want to leave the whole area because my wife is buried in this area too.\n\nThe one magic wand I would like is for the city to provide some place where we could park our vehicles in peace. We\u2019re being very law abiding. But we don\u2019t want trouble. We know we\u2019re living on the edge.\n\nListen to Fred Smith tell his story:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Back in 2003, I was doing well, getting $145,000 a year.
