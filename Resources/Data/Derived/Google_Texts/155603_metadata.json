I was wrong. Granted, I have been in error at several intervals when I believed that Tea Party Republicans, no matter how fervent and misguided their messages, were ultimately Americans first. There\u2019s no way they\u2019d take us close to the brink during the 2011 debt ceiling crisis, causing our nation\u2019s credit rating to be downgraded for the first time since those stats were recorded, right?\n\nOnce Obama roundly won re-election in November 2012 and after Obamacare became the law of the land, they\u2019d come to accept this as reality and move onto another target? Anyone? Anyone?\n\nBut most assuredly I had been led to believe that no matter what intransigent, batty opposition this faction of the G.O.P. had to all things POTUS supported, there was still one group\u2019s authority that brooked no opposition. I speak of course of Big Business, that bastion of free market, deregulated \u201cfreedom\u201d that these Tea Party patriots seem to value above all things, starting with the fabric of the social safety net.\n\nIt isn\u2019t very often that the views and interests of compassionate liberals and sterile, bottom-line driven business leaders intertwine, but these my friends, are unusual times. Thus we encounter headlines such as Business Groups See Loss of Sway Over House G.O.P. in last week\u2019s New York Times. The piece, from writers Eric Lipton, Nicholas Confessore and Nelson D. Schwartz, opens with the following:\n\n\u201cAs the government shutdown grinds toward a potential debt default, some of the country\u2019s most influential business executives have come to a conclusion all but unthinkable a few years ago: Their voices are carrying little weight with the House majority that their millions of dollars in campaign contributions helped build and sustain.\u201d\n\nRealizing that they are part and parcel of the tools used to build the 21st Century edition of Frankenstein\u2019s Monster, the story goes on to observe:\n\n\u201cTheir frustration has grown so intense in recent days that several trade association officials warned in interviews on Wednesday that they were considering helping wage primary campaigns against Republican lawmakers who had worked to engineer the political standoff in Washington. \u201d\n\nWell that is certainly a seismic shift in attitude toward the years of dollar-funneling in support of political campaigns, representing the most conservative \u201clawmakers.\u201d But I suppose even entities with interests that run counter to the health of the American worker see this indefensible legislative squatting for what it really is: a threat to the collective livelihood of everyone. How democratic.\n\nThe Times piece, however, was written a week ago. Since then Republican leaders have flirted with the possibility of a reasonable, balanced solution to the government shutdown/debt ceiling standoff. At the moment when a weekend compromise finally seemed possible, they then pulled the football away, Lucy-style, just as a tentative Democratic caucus (definitely the Charlie Brown of this analogy) was ready to kick it. What was the result?\n\nWriters Annie Lowrey and Nathaniel Popper write a fresh Times piece, World Leaders Press the U.S. on Fiscal Crisis that widens the net of recorded business community frustration. It represents an area no smaller than, you know, the entire planet. The article begins:\n\n\u201cLeaders at World Bank and International Monetary Fund meetings on Sunday pleaded, warned and cajoled: the United States must raise its debt ceiling and reopen its government or risk \u2018massive disruption the world over,\u2019 as Christine Lagarde, the fund\u2019s managing director, put it.\u201d\n\nLet it never be said that the IMF, former superfans of austerity, are in the pocket of liberal, Keynesian economists like Paul Krugman.\n\nBut here\u2019s my favorite section of the Lowrey and Popper piece:\n\n\u201cJamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, painted a bleak picture of the days ahead if there is no resolution. \u2018As you get closer to it, the panic will set in and something will happen,\u2019 Mr. Dimon said \u2026\u2019I don\u2019t personally know when that problem starts.\u2019 He added that JPMorgan had been \u2018spending huge amounts of time and money and effort to be prepared.'\u201d\n\nPeople, when the pleas of the vaunted Jamie Dimon, Wall Street kingpin and \u201cLondon Whale\u201d trading loss shepherd, go unheeded, we have entered a new era.\n\nAn era when a small minority of terrorists (I care not that Democratic leaders have tried to soften their language. It\u2019s getting them nowhere.) stand for nothing, care for no one, above and beyond getting their own way. I\u2019m not sure people on the right know what that even means anymore. Is there anyone left who can articulate and defend the maneuvers of these crackpots?\n\nThe business community has finally gotten hip: you were pawns. Pawns with a lot of money. The Tea Party intends to bring you down along with the rest of us.
