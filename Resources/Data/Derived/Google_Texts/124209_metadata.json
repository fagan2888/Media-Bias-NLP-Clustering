After reviewing close to 400 comments, several major changes were made including: Changing the start date from Jan. 1 to April 1, 2016; implementing the model in 67 metropolitan statistical areas instead of the proposed 75; and finalizing an alternative, composite quality score methodology, rather than the proposed threshold methodology to provide stronger incentives.\n\nLike Healthcare Finance on Facebook\n\nNo waivers for fraud and abuse authorities are being issued in the final rule. Rather, CMS and the Office of the Inspector General will jointly issue a notice regarding the waiver of certain fraud and abuse laws for the purposes of testing this model, CMS said. The notice will be published on the CMS and OIG websites.\n\nThe model also reflects best practices from the private sector, where major employers and leading providers and care systems are moving towards bundled payments for orthopedic services, CMS said.\n\n\"Today, we are embarking on one of the most important steps we will take to improve the quality and value of care for hundreds of thousands of Americans who have hip and knee replacements through Medicare every year,\" said Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia M. Burwell. \"By focusing on episodes of care, rather than a piecemeal system, we provide hospitals and physicians an incentive to work together to deliver the best care possible to patients.\"\n\nTwitter: @HenryPowderly", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/cms-sets-spring-launch-knee-and-hip-bundled-payment-initiative", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/knee-xray-hfn-feature.jpg", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "Under the model, hospitals in 67 geographic areas will receive additional payments if quality and spending performance are strong, or if not, have to potentially repay Medicare for a portion of the spending for care for a lower extremity joint replacement procedure.", "title": "CMS sets spring launch for knee and hip bundled payment initiative"}, "twitter": {"site": "@HC_Finance", "image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/knee-xray-hfn-feature.jpg"}, "description": "Under the model, hospitals in 67 geographic areas will receive additional payments if quality and spending performance are strong, or if not, have to potentially repay Medicare for a portion of the spending for care for a lower extremity joint replacement procedure.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "CMS sets spring launch for knee and hip bundled payment initiative"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services on Monday finalized details of its bundled payment initiative for hip and knee replacements and pushed back the launch date into the spring of 2016.", "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "In 2014, more than 400,000 Medicare beneficiaries received a hip or knee replacement, costing more than $7 billion for hospitalizations alone, CMS said.\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services on Monday finalized details of its bundled payment initiative for hip and knee replacements and pushed back the launch date into the spring of 2016.\nRather, CMS and the Office of the Inspector General will jointly issue a notice regarding the waiver of certain fraud and abuse laws for the purposes of testing this model, CMS said.\nCMS said it would help hospitals improve care delivery and care coordination by providing spending and utilization data and facilitating the sharing of best practices.\nCMS said it is also gradually phasing in repayment responsibility with a reduced discount percentage for repayment responsibility in years 2 and 3."}
