But it's important to find an appropriate measure because poor health in some groups threatens the health of all groups, he writes.\n\nHospitals are making efforts to close these gaps. For example, to help reduce healthcare disparities in the Detroit area, the Henry Ford Health System collects information about race, ethnicity and language on 80 percent of its patients. Since patients in the area are culturally diverse and 60 different languages are spoken in the community, the healthcare system trains staff to ask patients questions to determine their care needs and how to best serve them, FierceHealthcare previously reported.\n\nAnd earlier this year Permanente Medical Group CEO Robert Pearl, M.D. wrote about the organization's successful efforts to eliminate disparities by developing health education tools that cater to different segments of the population, investing in interpretation services for bilingual patients and partnering with the community to foster outreach and care coordination.\n\nTo learn more:\n\nread the HBR article\n\nRelated articles:\n\n3 strategies to drive population health\n\nHow Henry Ford Health System, Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital improved healthcare disparities\n\nHow increased diversity will change the business of healthcare\n\n4 ways to tackle healthcare disparities\n\n3 ways hospitals can address healthcare disparities among diverse patient populations\n\n5 ethical issues medical schools must address with future docs\n\nHospitals better on equitable care, but room for improvement\n\nNurses need cultural competency education to meet needs of diverse patients\n\nGuide outlines steps to become a culturally competent hospital", "article_metadata": {"description": "Health equity for all is essential to measure and improve population health, and that means the healthcare industry must allocate resources to\u00a0reduce disparities in care, a public health expert\u00a0writes\u00a0in\u00a0Harvard Business Review.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Health equity for all is essential to measure and improve population health, and that means the healthcare industry must allocate resources to\u00a0reduce disparities in care, a public health expert\u00a0writes\u00a0in\u00a0Harvard Business Review.", "title": "Health equity is essential to measure, improve population health", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/health-equity-essential-measure-improve-population-health/2015-09-17", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Care Delivery,Harvard Business Review,Healthcare Disparities,Patient Care & Outcomes,Population Health", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1639\"", "article_summary": "Health equity for all is essential to measure and improve population health, and that means the healthcare industry must allocate resources to reduce disparities in care, a public health expert writes in Harvard Business Review.\n\"Closing those gaps should be at the heart of efforts to measure and improve population health, even it means sacrificing some efficiency,\" he writes.\nBut it's important to find an appropriate measure because poor health in some groups threatens the health of all groups, he writes.\nPopulation health is difficult to measure and the results of improvement initiatives are hard to quantify across social, racial and economic groups, according to Galea.\nFor example, to help reduce healthcare disparities in the Detroit area, the Henry Ford Health System collects information about race, ethnicity and language on 80 percent of its patients."}
