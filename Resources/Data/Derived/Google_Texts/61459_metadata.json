Ross said on Jan. 31 the investment from the health foundation solidifies its commitment to increase African-American enrollment in Medi-Cal and \u201cObamacare.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are serious about making certain that every Californian is covered, in particular, the African-American community,\u201d says the former Covered California board member. \u201cWe want 100 percent coverage.\u201d\n\nRoss made the announcement about the outreach dollars at the non-profit group\u2019s Organizing for Action \u201cEnroll at the Bowl; Morning \u2018til Midnight\u201d, event held at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena. The day-long outing was geared toward enrolling as many eligible persons as possible for reduced-cost health insurance through Obama-care, officially known as the Affordable Care Act, or Medi-Cal, the state\u2019s safety-net insurance program.\n\nThe monies will benefit an initiative to include targeted paid media efforts coordinated through California Black Media, and efforts ran by the California Black Health Network to complete outreach and education through health fairs, church rallies, and town halls.\n\nRoss said California has been a leader in healthcare enrollment.\n\n\u201cBut we all have more work to do to ensure everyone has access to quality, affordable healthcare,\u201d says Ross.\n\nAccording to Covered California numbers from last October, only 2.4 percent, of the approximately 1.3 million Obama-care enrollees since January 2014, are African-American.\n\nCovered California Executive Director Peter V. Lee said health insurance enrollment in the Black community is very important. He said the signing of the Affordable Care Act by U.S. President Barack Obama is one of the most important steps in advancing social justice.\n\n\u201cI have been thrilled to see how many of the African-American churches, political groups, community organizations are saying, \u2018We need to step up. The door is open. Let\u2019s get everyone in our community through that door,\u2019\u201d says Lee. \u201cWe\u2019ve had huge numbers of African Americans enroll in Covered California and Medi-Cal. We need to celebrate the fact that in African-American communities there are tens of thousands who have insurance.\u201d\n\nSharing the Basics of Insurance Coverage Is Key\n\nCovered California\u2019s top official said members of the Black community who have health insurance need to tell their friends and neighbors that health coverage is obtainable. He said fears about the cost of Obama-care is the main reason people in the Black community do not register for health insurance.\n\n\u201cNine of the ten people who sign up for Covered California get huge financial help,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople in Medi-Cal aren\u2019t paying anything. Affordability is the number one barrier. That means our number one tool is education.\u201d\n\nThe last day of January was the final day of the three-month, open enrollment period for individuals and families without health insurance to sign up for Obama-care. The next enrollment period begins in November.\n\nEligible Californians can enroll in the reduced cost Medi-Cal program year round.\n\nBefore lunchtime at the \u201cEnroll at the Bowl\u201d event, those without healthcare were sent to one of the Rose Bowl\u2019s executive suites. There, they registered for insurance with the help of volunteers, while munching on breakfast snacks and drinking coffee and orange juice.\n\nPasadena City Councilman Tyron Hampton, civil rights lawyer Connie Rice, and U.S. Congresswoman Judy Chu were on-hand greeting health care enrollees at the event.\n\nHampton presented Lee with a Certificate of Appreciation from the City of Pasadena praising the work Covered California has done in the three years Obama-care has been law.\n\nLee said millions of Californians have coverage thanks to Covered California, but more work is needed.\n\n\u201cWe need Covered California to be woven into the fabric of the African-American community,\u201d says Lee. \u201cThat is what we are trying to do.\u201d\n\nHealthcare Coverage Is Vital in Black Communities\n\nChu, the representative for California\u2019s 27th district, said health insurance outreach to the Black community is critical. She said non-profit groups and agencies that help people enroll for healthcare are important because they dissuade myths, such as, enrollment being difficult.\n\nThe Democratic congresswoman said she is angry and outraged by Republicans on the campaign trail and the nation\u2019s capital continuously saying they want to abolish Obama-care.\n\n\u201cThis law has helped so many people who would otherwise have nowhere else to turn,\u201d she said. \u201cTo have these votes to disband Obama-care \u2013 even after the U.S. Supreme Court approved it \u2013 is ridiculous and un-American.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"robots": "noodp,noydir"}, "article_summary": "The monies will benefit an initiative to include targeted paid media efforts coordinated through California Black Media, and efforts ran by the California Black Health Network to complete outreach and education through health fairs, church rallies, and town halls.\nCovered California Executive Director Peter V.
