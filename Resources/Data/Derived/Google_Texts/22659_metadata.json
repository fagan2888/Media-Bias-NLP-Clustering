These aren\u2019t the stocks that are outperforming the S&P 500. You\u2019d be better off buying an index fund and spending the rest of your summer trying to get rid of your farmer\u2019s tan at the beach\u2026\n\nBut if you want to put an end to your puny returns, you have to ride the market\u2019s strongest sectors. Stocks in motion tend to stay in motion. And the in-favor sectors will probably continue to lead the market\u2026\n\nIt\u2019s stock market physics in action!\n\nToday, I\u2019m going to dissect the S&P to show you the three best performing sectors of 2014\u2014and how to play them for outsized returns.\n\nFirst up is healthcare, the third-best performing sector during the first half of the year. Back when biotech shares were melting down a few months ago, I told you healthcare stocks could be a safe \u201chideout\u201d for your trading dollars. Well, the sector hasn\u2019t disappointed\u2026\n\nThe Health Care Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSE:XLV) has gained more than 13% year-to-date. In fact, the health care sector posted more than half of its year-to-date gains in just the past two months. If you\u2019re looking for some fundamental catalysts, the Affordable Care Act and an aging population both remain big themes in the long-term\u2026\n\nWhile XLV is trading near the top of its range right now, it remains a \u201cbuy-the-dips\u201d opportunity during the second half of 2014.\n\nNext up is the utilities sector.\n\nBack when traders began pushing momentum stocks down the stairs earlier this year, investors fled to anything paying a dividend. That\u2019s right\u2013 the boring, dividend-paying names everyone ignored while the market was ripping higher were bouncing like growth stocks. High-yielding utilities were among the big winners. And even as momentum stocks recovered in June, utility shares continued to post new highs.\n\nThe Utilities Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLU) is your best bet at playing this sector. These stocks have sharply fallen from their highs this month. But if XLU can bounce higher near $42, the uptrend will remain intact.\n\nFinally, we come to the year\u2019s best performing sector: Energy. The Energy Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLE) has gained nearly 15% year-to-date. Unless you\u2019ve been sleepwalking all year \u2014 or just not reading your emails\u2013 you know energy has been one of our biggest investing themes of 2014.\n\nRegards,\n\nGreg Guenthner\n\nfor The Daily Reckoning\n\nP.S. XLE (and many energy stocks, for that matter) remain overextended. So if you\u2019re looking for a solid investment in this sector, you\u2019d be better off to wait for XLE to churn sideways a bit before buying with both hands.
