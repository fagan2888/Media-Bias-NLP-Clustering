Fifty-five-year-old Rolf Buchholz, Guinness World Records holder for the most piercings \u2014 278 of which are located around his genitals \u2014 had his passport stamped and approved at the airport, but was stopped before he was able to exit customs. The heavily pierced and tattooed German native claims he was barred from entering the Islamic city because officials were concerned he practiced \u201cblack magic.\u201d\n\nBuchholz, who was scheduled to appear at the Cirque le Soir nightclub in the Fairmont Hotel in Dubai, still seeks answers from officials for the denial of his entry. \"I got never an official answer,\" Buchholz told The Associated Press. \"They are friendly but nobody answers your questions.\" Allegedly, airport workers told him officials were concerned he could be a practitioner of black magic, although the authorities were not so blatant.\n\nI am at Dubai airport. They let me not in the country. The luggage is lost. I am ok. \u2014 Rolf Buchholz (@rolf_de) August 15, 2014\n\nOn the way back home. Dubai I will never come back!!! \u2014 Rolf Buchholz (@rolf_de) August 15, 2014\n\nAt the end I got an answer why I can't enter Dubai: The Immigration thought I am Black Magic. Stupid people. \u2014 Rolf Buchholz (@rolf_de) August 16, 2014\n\nWhile Buchholz claims black magic is the reason why he wasn\u2019t allowed in Dubai, Cirque le Soir nightclub said it was for different reasons. In an emailed statement to the AP, Jad Lahoud, the executive director of Pragma Lifestyle, the company that runs the Dubai branch of the club, said that airport authorities cited \u201csecurity reasons\u201d in denying him entry. \"Cirque le Soir Dubai always strives to bring unique entertainment and concepts to the UAE, however we will always act in line with the laws that govern this nation.\u201d\n\nThe Dubai club includes everything from \"stilt walkers, midgets, contortionists, tattooed dancers, jugglers, drummers ... magicians and fire eaters,\" according to its website. In Dubai, alcohol consumption is seen in bars and clubs, and tourists and residents can dress like they do in the West. However, actions that threaten local values, including public displays of affection, public intoxication, and disrespect for religion, can lead to fines and jail time.\n\nIn a previous interview with the Daily Mail, Buchhholz, an information technology professional in Germany, told the news outlet: \u201cI think it\u2019s not changing my life,\u201d referring to his tattoos and piercings. Now, he realizes his two horns could have also been a problem for him in Dubai. Buchholz is now reconsidering returning to Dubai if he had government assurance he would be let in.\n\nBuchholz is currently resting in Germany after the debacle in Dubai.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "rolf buchholz, guinness world records, black magic, dubai, world's most pierced man, piercings, tattoos,", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Dubai officials stopped the world\u2019s most pierced man, with 453 piercings and horn implants at customs, over claims of \u201cblack magic.\u201d", "title": "Dubai Denies Entry For World's Most Pierced Man [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/rolf-buchholz-worlds-most-pierced-man-horn-implants-denied-entry-dubai-over-black-magic-298522", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/18/rolf-buchholz-talks-about-piercings-and-tattoos.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Dubai officials stopped the world\u2019s most pierced man, with 453 piercings and horn implants at customs, over claims of \u201cblack magic.\u201d", "title": "Dubai Denies Entry For World's Most Pierced Man [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/rolf-buchholz-worlds-most-pierced-man-horn-implants-denied-entry-dubai-over-black-magic-298522", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/18/rolf-buchholz-talks-about-piercings-and-tattoos.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/18/rolf-buchholz-talks-about-piercings-and-tattoos.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-08-18T14:46:45-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-18T14:46:44-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Dubai officials stopped the world\u2019s most pierced man, with 453 piercings and horn implants at customs, over claims of \u201cblack magic.\u201d"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd09cf\"", "article_summary": "Dubai officials deny entry to Rolf Buchholz, the world\u2019s most pierced man with 453 piercings and horn implants, over claims of \u201cblack magic.\u201dDubai officials deny entry to Rolf Buchholz, the world\u2019s most pierced man with 453 piercings and horn implants, over claims of \u201cblack magic.\u201d DailyMailThe world\u2019s most pierced man may have tipped the scale in the Gulf\u2019s most liberal city when he landed in Dubai with all of his 453 piercings and his horn implants.\n\u2014 Rolf Buchholz (@rolf_de) August 16, 2014While Buchholz claims black magic is the reason why he wasn\u2019t allowed in Dubai, Cirque le Soir nightclub said it was for different reasons.\n\u2014 Rolf Buchholz (@rolf_de) August 15, 2014At the end I got an answer why I can't enter Dubai: The Immigration thought I am Black Magic.\nI am ok. \u2014 Rolf Buchholz (@rolf_de) August 15, 2014On the way back home.\nAllegedly, airport workers told him officials were concerned he could be a practitioner of black magic, although the authorities were not so blatant."}
