It was apparently a resend of an identical memo sent out June 5, the day after the Obama administration first revealed the data breach at the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).\n\nIn the alert, the FBI said hackers had recently used Sakula to steal \u201csensitive business information and personally identifiable information,\u201d which would include names, dates of birth, and Social Security numbers.\n\nSuch data, the alert said, was a \u201cpriority target\u201d for the cyberattackers.\n\nSakula is the malware of choice for a prominent Chinese hacking group that has targeted many U.S. businesses. It\u2019s also the malware that was behind the mammoth data breaches at health insurers Anthem and Premera Blue Cross.\n\nSecurity firms had previously tied the cyberattacks on both health insurers to the crippling hacks at the OPM, which have likely exposed well over 18 million current and former government employees' sensitive information.\n\nBut Wednesday\u2019s memo is further evidence the government also thinks the incidents are linked. While the government has not publicly blamed China, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper has called China the \u201cleading suspect\u201d in the OPM breach.\n\nIt\u2019s believed Chinese hackers were targeting the health insurers and the OPM as part of a cyber espionage scheme to build a comprehensive database on U.S. federal workers.\n\nSensitive information on government employees can be used to stage future cyberattacks, digitally imitate or blackmail officials, or even to recruit informants.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The bureau sent out an alert Wednesday night to private companies.", "description": "The bureau sent out an alert Wednesday night to private companies.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Cory Bennett", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The bureau sent out an alert Wednesday night to private companies.", "title": "FBI: Chinese malware possibly behind OPM hack", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/246754-fbi-warns-of-chinese-malware-possibly-behind-opm-hack", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/fbi_getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T03:39-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/246754-fbi-warns-of-chinese-malware-possibly-behind-opm-hack", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2015-07-02T10:47-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Cory Bennett", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-02T10:47:18-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00"}, "keywords": ",,", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/246754-fbi-warns-of-chinese-malware-possibly-behind-opm-hack", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The bureau sent out an alert Wednesday night to private companies.", "card": "summary", "title": "FBI: Chinese malware possibly behind OPM hack"}, "dcterms.title": "FBI: Chinese malware possibly behind OPM hack"}, "article_summary": "The FBI warned companies Wednesday night about malicious software that security experts have tied to Chinese hackers, The Daily Beast reported.\nIt\u2019s believed Chinese hackers were targeting the health insurers and the OPM as part of a cyber espionage scheme to build a comprehensive database on U.S. federal workers.\nIt\u2019s also the malware that was behind the mammoth data breaches at health insurers Anthem and Premera Blue Cross.\nSakula is the malware of choice for a prominent Chinese hacking group that has targeted many U.S. businesses.\nADVERTISEMENTThe message, known as a \u201cflash\u201d alert, provided technical details about the Sakula malware."}
