Polish people are being encouraged to eat more apples to offset the expected negative effects of a ban that Russia imposed last week on Polish fruit. (Photo: Czarek Sokolowski, AP)\n\nLast week, Moscow banned imports of meat, fish, milk and fruit from the USA and other countries in retaliation for sanctions imposed by the U.S. and European Union. Comments from Facebook are edited for clarity and grammar:\n\nThe food ban will hurt Russia more. Its people will be back in long lines for food again. The Russian troops massed on the border with Ukraine are there for one reason, and that is to support the rebels when needed.\n\nThe question is, what are President Obama, the European Union and NATO going to do?\n\n\u2014 Bob Patterson\n\nIf Russian President Vladimir Putin and his government wish to return to isolationism, then let them. We'll see how long that lasts. History has already gone down that path, and it doesn't work, but let the man and the country learn.\n\nWe are all on this earth together. Sooner or later, you have to grow up and act like it.\n\n\u2014 Robert Phallan\n\nImporting food from China will be next. Putin is an absolute throwback to the old communist days. It's his way or the highway, and he doesn't care how much his citizens suffer in his quest to re-establish the old Soviet Union.\n\n\u2014 Justin Garver\n\nRussia gets about 40% of its food from imports. When the people of Russia have to stand in line all day for basics as they did back under communist rule, maybe they will finally rise up and overthrow this dictatorship.\n\n\u2014 Joe Mamas\n\nActually, Russian domestic producers will thrive because they will have less competition from EU imports. EU producers are the obvious losers here.\n\n\u2014 Dmitry Krantsberg\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/Ve1doT", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Last week, Moscow banned imports of meat, fish, milk and fruit from the USA and other countries in retaliation for economic sanctions.", "og": {"site_name": "USA TODAY", "description": "Last week, Moscow banned imports of meat, fish, milk and fruit from the USA and other countries in retaliation for economic sanctions.", "title": "How much will Russia's food ban hurt?
