(Punches thrown at rallies? Check. Blatant sexism tossed at journalists? Check.) The newest scandal emerged when the National Enquirer alleged that Texas Sen. Ted Cruz has had affairs with five women, which Cruz promptly denied Friday. There's no proof to back the story up, but some people decided to run with the idea of a sexting Ted Cruz in order to tweet hilarious #TedSext jokes. The best #TedSext tweets are such a gold mine that I wouldn't be surprised if some people wanted the rumors to be true, just so that they could keep the joke going.\n\nCruz did not immediately respond to Romper's request for comment, but Cruz denied the allegations on Facebook:\n\nI want to be crystal clear: these attacks are garbage. For Donald J. Trump to enlist his friends at the National Enquirer and his political henchmen to do his bidding shows you that there is no low Donald won\u2019t go. These smears are completely false, they\u2019re offensive to Heidi and me, they\u2019re offensive to our daughters, and they\u2019re offensive to everyone Donald continues to personally attack.\n\nBusiness mogul Donald Trump fired back on Facebook, saying, \"I have no idea whether or not the cover story about Ted Cruz in this week\u2019s issue of the National Enquirer is true or not, but I had absolutely nothing to do with it, did not know about it, and have not, as yet, read it.\"\n\nThe allegations \u2014 which would definitely benefit any Cruz opponents \u2014 are definitely disrespectful, but they're not surprising after such a strange week (or month, or year) in the GOP race. As writer Chris Cillizza wrote for his Washington Post blog: \"While the reaction Friday morning to the Cruz allegations tended toward surprise and disgust, neither feeling really makes much sense when you consider the context of the broader campaign.\"\n\nUnfazed, but seeing the fantastic comedic opportunity, the public began to bombard Twitter with hypothetical, politically-infused sexts Cruz might send rumored his lovers.\n\nI wanna patrol your body like a Muslim neighborhood #TedSexts \u2014 Ira Madison III (@ira) March 25, 2016\n\n\"Girl, I'm about to repeal them panties like they was Obamacare.\" #TedSexts #cruzsexscandal \u2014 Mia McKenzie (@miamckenzie) March 25, 2016\n\n\"I'm harder than getting an abortion in Texas.\" #TedSexts #cruzsexscandal \u2014 Mia McKenzie (@miamckenzie) March 25, 2016\n\nLet's snuggle by the fireplace as I burn the resumes of qualified LGBT hires #TedSexts \u2014 Ira Madison III (@ira) March 25, 2016\n\nTed: I wanna ruin you like women's repro rights, girl #TedSexts \u2014 I'm a General, weee!
