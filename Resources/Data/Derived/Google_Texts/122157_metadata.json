Bush, Harry Reid, Marco Rubio, Minimum wage, Mitch McConnell, Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, Business News, Politics News\n\nToo bad George W. Bush is persona non grata among congressional Republicans. If he were less unpopular, they might find in the waning years of his presidency an example of what to do about a vexing issue facing them in 2016, an issue Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell called that \u201cgosh darn\u201d minimum wage.\n\nIn their bid to take over the Congress in 2006, the Democrats vowed to raise a federal minimum wage that had remained unchanged since the second term of the Clinton administration. After sweeping midterm victories in both chambers, congressional Democrats put the issue on their agenda, calling for an incremental increase from $5.15 an hour to $7.25 by 2009.\n\nThat wasn\u2019t enough for Barack Obama, who vowed to raise the minimum wage to $9.50 by 2011 if elected president. His promise, however, came before the Great Recession cast a pall over many of his campaign promises. The federal minimum wage has remained $7.25 since he took office. (It is now higher in some cities and states; New York State recently raised it to $15 an hour in the New York City metropolitan area and $12.50 upstate.)\n\nSo the push to raise the minimum wage isn\u2019t new. That\u2019s a bit counterintuitive given the attention being paid to economic inequality, an issue that arose in the aftermath of the 2007 financial collapse. Even Republican contenders for the White House are obliged at least to pay lip service to the issue. And to be sure, a stagnant minimum wage is the bedrock of economic inequality. But the thread of the debate began during the second Bush administration, which was hostile or indifferent to the law, and allowed the purchasing power of the base wage to erode while the cost of living continued to climb or, indeed, soar.\n\nWhat did President Bush do that could serve as a model for today\u2019s congressional Republicans? First, two observations. One, Bush\u2019s presidency was nearing historic levels of unpopularity by 2007. Two, voters tend to punish the party in power in hard times. The 2008 election was going to be rough for any GOP candidate.\n\nBut also keep in mind the nature of the business wing of the GOP. It is against wage mandates, because wages cut into profits. But the faction is also politically canny. It was willing to concede to demands for a higher minimum wage, if conceding weakened Democrats in 2008. Put another way: If Republicans had continued to resist raising the wage, then the wage issue might have become more potent for Barack Obama. So the business wing of the Republican Party \u2014 including 82 members of the House, all but three senators, and the president \u2014 held its nose and supported a wage hike.\n\nThe conservative wing of the GOP, on the other hand, is the opposite of canny. It does not see the wisdom of conceding on the minimum wage, even as the minimum wage has taken on more significance than it had a decade ago. Conservatives believe losing now means losing forever, and losing is inconceivable given the righteousness of their cause. Therefore, the more they resist raising the minimum wage, the more potent it will be for the Democratic Party\u2019s nominee. As Harry Reid told The Hill yesterday: \u201cIf Republicans don\u2019t do something about it, it\u2019s a major issue.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bush and the GOP business wing got the politics of a minimum wage hike right in 2007.
