Sisseton, SD

The Sisseton Redman Mascot has caused a stir in the community. For a collection of high school girls, they are trying to raise awareness about what they say is a civil rights issue.

For many it's a shirt, but for these high school students, it means much more.

"The message we want to send out is that it's not appropriate to make people an image and portray us as an image so that would give them the right to look down at us, and we're not an image, we're people too," student Fidelity Eastman said.

The shirt has a bandana over the face of the Sisseton Redman logo. The girls say it symbolizes the hidden faces of the country, American Indians. Many of the students went to the school in Sisseton before transferring to the Tribal School Tiospa Zina.

The girls say their problems aren't just with the mascot, but also the schools homecoming coronation. Every year people will wear traditional Native American headdress, even if they aren't Native American.

"That's not really suppose to be public and like it's kind of a sacred to us and it seems like to them their just making it a mockery and while they'll doing it there whooping and I don't know, I find that disrespectful," student Hailey Shepherd said.

Many of the girls play on the high school basketball team. Fiedelity Eastman says having teammates stand together is making this whole process easier.

"Having support from family, friends and everything, it just keeps it positive, and that's what we want. We just want positive vibes and positive change," Eastman said.

A classmate of the girls, Bruce Gunderson, also went to school in Sisseton before transferring to play basketball with Tiospa Zina this year.

"I went to school there pretty much my whole live and never got treated any different than any other kids and that's why I'm pretty much neutral and stuff," Gunderson said.

They girls say their message goes way beyond Sisseton. It's for anybody needing a voice.

"It's not just a racial issue. It's civil rights and we're not pinpointing out anybody. We're just standing up for what we believe in and what we believe is right," student Bethany Robertson said.

Whether it's huddling together on the basketball court, or praying together off of it, these high school students will continue to stand together and spread their message.

Around 300 shirts have been printed and handed out. The girls are not selling the t-shirts, just giving them out to raise awareness.
