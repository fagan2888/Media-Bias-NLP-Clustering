Colorado’s unrelenting winter storms over the last two weeks have left very high avalanche danger in the high country, particularly in the southwest corner of the state.

The Colorado Avalanche Information Center said on Christmas that no mountain area is devoid of extreme risk.

In Summit and Eagle counties, popular backcountry recreation areas for those along the Front Range, forecasters say human-triggered slides are likely.

“A combination 2 to 3 feet of new snowfall and strong westerly winds created cohesive slabs at all elevations,” the CAIC said in a bulletin. “Several large avalanches have run since Tuesday. Avalanche mitigation along the Interstate 70 corridor triggered several large avalanches.”

Areas of I-70 along Vail Pass and near the Eisenhower Tunnels were closed temporarily on Thursday morning as crews detonated charges to mitigate avalanche risk.

The work near the Continental Divide created brief back ups on the interstate as explosions echoed along the mountains.

“Stay off slopes steeper than about 30 degrees and avoid travel below large avalanche paths,” the bulletin said.

Avalanche danger is listed as “high” in southwest Colorado where a slide warning is in effect into Saturday afternoon.

“Natural and triggered avalanches are likely and human triggered avalanches are very likely,” the CAIC said. “Travel in backcountry avalanche terrain is not recommended at this time.”
