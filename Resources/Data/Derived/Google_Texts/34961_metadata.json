While Sydney and Kerry had many adventures collecting wearable treasures from around the world, they understood that some of the most unique and culturally important jewelry could be found in their own backyard.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t like I just woke up and said, \u2018Let me do this\u2019, it was a gradual process in realizing the battle I wanted to fight. We\u2019ll work with Native female artisans who lack accessibility to public markets, to bridge the gap between the mainstream fashion industry and artistry to continue to thrive in traditional Native communities,\u201d she says. \u201cTheir products will sell at fair prices in order to earn a higher income and eventually attain financial independence.\n\n\u201cI believe in empowerment of Native American artisans and entrepreneurs and through development of formal partnerships with artistic creators, women who exhibit traditional talent, we will have the power to change mainstream concepts of what it means to be a contemporary indigenous woman today.

While beading is historically a Plains Indian tradition, other Native communities have adopted it as a means of resilience to support their families, and this fledgling facility wants to follow that trend.\n\nEtkie bracelets are hand-beaded on a traditional Navajo loom, made with high-quality seed beads sewn onto genuine deerskin linings sourced from a New Mexico leather company, and finished with custom buttons. The leather ties can be untied and adjusted to allow for modification of the six-inch-long bracelets to most wrist sizes. Each wrap bracelet is handcrafted and takes between four and six hours to make.\n\n\u201cLaunching a new business from nothing can be intimidating and I\u2019m impressed with what Etkie has accomplished thus far with limited resources,\u201d says Dr. Jessica Metcalfe (Turtle Mountain Chippewa), who not long ago took the entrepreneurial plunge in establishing Beyond Buckskin Boutique. \u201cBoth our companies will work with individual artists to launch and grow their own businesses.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Beyond Buckskin Boutique, Online Store Featuring Native-Made High Fashion, Launches\n\nBack-to-School and Father's Day Gift Guide ideas\n\nThe successful Metcalfe foresees success in the Etkie effort:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Etkie turns beads into fashionable dreams by helping at-risk Native women gain financial independence and pride.If one footstep can begin a lifelong journey, so too can a single piece of jewelry.\u00a0A new start-up firm comprised of several Native women, Etkie, is hopeful their line of hand-beaded bracelets is the start of such a journey.\u00a0\u201cAs contemporary Native America sees a re-emergence of artists, designers and social advocates in communities with Indian populations, our company is committed to the financial and social empowerment of Native American women in New Mexico,\u201d says founder Sydney Alfonso.\u00a0The leader of the Etkie team was raised (by Kerry, the mother half of the mother-daughter team) in rural New Mexico where she grew up surrounded by inspiring, determined and talented women\u2014a childhood that begat passion about social consumerism, financial inclusion and gender equality in the workplace.
