Nothing has changed in the last three days.\n\nThe NMHIX can handle accounts from small businesses. Officials at NMHIX boasted on Tuesday it had signed up 29 small businesses in the first 45 minutes of operation, and that by midday about 100 had enrolled.\n\nBut if you want information for individual accounts, NMHIX directs you to the federal government\u2019s website, www.healthcare.gov.\n\nThat website features a smiling young woman and this headline:\n\nThe page may say, \u201cThe Health Insurance Marketplace is Open!\u201d but on Tuesday, I couldn\u2019t create an account because, while filling out the application process, the drop boxes on the security questions didn\u2019t work.\n\nAs has been mentioned in stories across the country, the healthcare.gov site was plagued with glitches.\n\nSo, now that three days have passed, I tried again.\n\nI logged on at 10:49 a.m. Friday, saw the smiling woman and clicked on \u201cApply Now.\u201d Up popped:\n\nAfter 14 minutes, the site took to me the \u201cLet\u2019s Get Started\u201d page. I started filling out the necessary information \u2014 name, address, email, etc. \u2014 to create an account.\n\nThis time, I was able to get to the security questions and the drop boxes actually worked. Great, it looked like I was on my way.\n\nBut after filling out the three security questions, up popped:\n\nI thought I filled out the questions correctly, but nevertheless I returned to the account page and tried again.\n\nAfter filling out the boxes a second time, I got the same message.\n\nSo I called the NMHIX hotline again (hold times are shorter than on the federal number) and this time, I talked to an operator named Deborah.\n\n\u201cAm I doing something wrong when I fill out the security questions?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cNo, the security questions are not working,\u201d she said. \u201cThey tell us it could be two to three weeks before they get it fixed.\u201d \u201cThey\u201d meaning the fed\u2019s www.healthcare.gov site.\n\nApparently, some applicants get as far as I did before the system freezes up, but Deborah said others don\u2019t.\n\nShe said I could click on the \u201cChat\u201d button to let the feds know about my issue. I did, where after a nine-minute wait, a chat operator named Salina came online.\n\n\u201cI apologize for the inconvenience,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWe are aware of the issues and we are working in resolving them.\u201d\n\nSalina offered no time line for clearing up the glitches. \u201c\u2026Unfortunately, I do not have that information\u2026Again, I apologize for the inconvenience,\u201d she wrote.\n\nAfter my story Tuesday, a couple of New Mexico Watchdog readers relayed similar stories. Bob in Santa Fe wrote to tell me his son thought he had created an account but:\n\n\u201cAfter about 15 minutes, he signed onto his account, found the email, and clicked on the link. Nothing happened for several minutes. Then a message came up saying that too much time had elapsed, so this account was canceled! I tried again, but we were back to square one. I did get through, but after I had entered all of the information, a message told me that the system was down. Twice!\u201d\n\nAnother reader, John, left me this comment: \u201cI have been able to at least to get log-in information but so far have not been able to connect \u2014 the system says wait as we have heavy traffic, guess everyone else is attempting to check out health insurance at 4 and 5 AM. Looks they got the slowest dial up speed they could!!\u201d\n\nWe\u2019re not alone, but that\u2019s little consolation.\n\nI\u2019ll try again in a couple of days.\n\nContact Rob Nikolewski at rnikolewski@watchdog.org and follow him on Twitter @robnikolewski", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Part 18 of 97 in the series Obamacare By Rob Nikolewski \u2502 New Mexico Watchdog SANTA FE \u2013\u00a0Dear readers, you may\u00a0recall that on Tuesday \u2014\u00a0the first day of the rollout of the new health care law \u2014\u00a0I posted a story on my attempt\u00a0to get information on what \u00a0individual health care coverage I was eligible for \u2026", "title": "Maddening: Trying to log onto federal health care site - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/10/healthcare.gov-security-question-problem.jpg", "updated_time": "2013-10-17T11:44:26+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/109305/maddening-trying-to-log-onto-federal-health-care-site/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Health Care", "tag": "New Mexico Health Insurance Exchange,New Mexico Watchdog,www.healthcare.gov", "published_time": "2013-10-04T12:29:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-10-17T11:44:26+00:00"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Part 18 of 97 in the series Obamacare By Rob Nikolewski \u2502 New Mexico Watchdog SANTA FE \u2013\u00a0Dear readers, you may\u00a0recall that on Tuesday \u2014\u00a0the first day of the rollout of the new health care law \u2014\u00a0I posted a story on my attempt\u00a0to get information on what \u00a0individual health care coverage I was eligible for [\u2026]", "title": "Maddening: Trying to log onto federal health care site - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/10/images.jpg"}, "creator": "@watchdogorg", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe6390\"", "article_summary": "This time, I was able to get to the security questions and the drop boxes actually worked.\n\u201cAm I doing something wrong when I fill out the security questions?\u201d I asked.\nI already have insurance through my employer, but like many in my state, I\u2019m curious to compare what I\u2019m paying for now with what I could get through the New Mexico Health Insurance Exchange.\n\u201cNo, the security questions are not working,\u201d she said.\nBut if you want information for individual accounts, NMHIX directs you to the federal government\u2019s website, www.healthcare.gov."}
