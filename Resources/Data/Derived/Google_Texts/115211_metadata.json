And, on Friday, to Lubbock as part of the Covenant Health and the Lubbock Methodist Hospital System Board\u2019s Michael E. DeBakey, M.D. Distinguished Lectureship Series.\n\nAbout 300 people packed the Lubbock Country Club during the sold-out event Friday evening as they listened to Carson speak on the topic \u201cAmerica the Beautiful: Rediscovering What Made This Nation Great.\u201d\n\nCarson is a world-renowned pediatric neurosurgeon known for the first separation of conjoined twins joined at the back of the head in 1987, according to a news release.\n\n\u201cWhat a wonderful country that we\u2019re privileged to live in and we\u2019re doubly privileged, those of us in the medical profession, because people turn over to us the most important thing they have, their lives,\u201d Carson said in an interview prior to Friday\u2019s event. \u201cWe get to intervene in that and give them longevity and quality of life, and there\u2019s few things that compare to the satisfaction that comes out of that.\u201d\n\nThe DeBakey Distinguished Lecture Series was initiated in 2004 by Covenant Chief Medical Officer Emeritus Dr. Robert Salem, who had studied and trained under DeBakey, according to a news relase.\n\n\u201cDeBakey was the inaugural speaker for the series,\u201d the release states. \u201cThe series has brought to West Texas nearly a dozen well-known names in heart and cardiac medicine. This year the series broadens its subject matter by hosting Carson.\u201d\n\nRichard Parks, chief executive officer of Covenant, recalled how Salem, was able to get Carson to speak at this year\u2019s event.\n\n\u201cBob came to me a few months ago and told me, \u2018I think we need to have Dr. Carson come,\u2019\u201d Parks said. \u201cI said, \u2018Sure, if you have the time to pursue that you go right ahead, thinking the chances that were slim to none.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut, as he remembered learning when he first move to town \u2014 never underestimate Salem\u2019s perserverance and connections.\n\nParks said he was pleased to welcome Carson to Lubbock.\n\n\u201cWe have our own renowned group of neurosurgeons here and everytime we get a chance to recruit ... I just want to say we have a medical staff application here we\u2019d like to you to fill out,\u201d Parks joked.\n\nAs Salem talked about Carson being awared the Presidential Medal of Freedom \u2014 the highest civilian honor in the U.S \u2014 he went on to say Carson has accomplished so much, he couldn\u2019t possibly list them all during his introduction.\n\n\u201cAs of late, he has become recognized as a highly acclaimed New York Times best-selling author of six books, well-regarded syndicated columist for the Washington Post and I dare say, the hottest comodity in the speaking circuit in America,\u201d Salem said.\n\nCarson received a standing ovation as he took the podium Friday night, talking about how he began his career in medicine. He also talked about the future of healthcare in the U.S.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing that a person possesses that even comes close to their value and their health,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the reasons why I and other people have been fighting so hard against the Affordable Care Act. We want health care for everybody that\u2019s really affordable.\u201d\n\nsarah.rafique@lubbockonline.com\n\n\u25cf 766-2159\n\nFollow Sarah on Twitter\n\n@SarahRafique", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Local News, Sarah Rafique", "og": {"site_name": "Lubbock Online | Lubbock Avalanche-Journal", "description": "Dr. Ben Carson has operated on 15,000 patients throughout his medical career. \nAlthough he had different plans in mind after retiring, like golfing more and studying other languages, Carson's life eventually led him to the speaking circuit.", "title": "Renowned pediatric neurosurgeon Carson speaks in Lubbock", "url": "http://lubbockonline.com/local-news/2015-03-13/renowned-pediatric-neurosurgeon-carson-speaks-lubbock", "image": "http://lubbockonline.com/sites/default/files/14207191.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "Dr. Ben Carson has operated on 15,000 patients throughout his medical career.Although he had different plans in mind after retiring, like golfing more and studying other languages, Carson\u2019s life eventually led him to the speaking circuit.
