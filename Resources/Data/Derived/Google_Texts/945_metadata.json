Mike Honda next year, has fleshed out his policy positions on his campaign\u2019s new website \u2013 and some of his staunch conservative views might be a hard sell in a district that\u2019s only 19 percent Republican.\n\nCohen, a 56-year-old accountant, said last week that if elected he would aim to join the arch-conservative Freedom Caucus \u2013 the Tea Party-dominated group of about three dozen Republicans that ousted former House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, and foiled Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Bakersfield, from succeeding him.\n\nJudging from his website, Cohen\u2019s political views are similar to those of libertarian-leaning Republicans such as former presidential candidate Texas Congressman Ron Paul. The \u201cdetailed analysis\u201d part of his site says some parts are \u201ca copy from Rand Paul\u2019s website and others, with whom I agree.\u201d\n\nCohen says the most important issue is unsustainable federal spending and debt. \u201cThis is an existential threat to the nation.\u201d\n\nOn immigration, \u201cwe must secure our borders, use E-Verify, have a Temporary Workers Program, tighten visitor and student visas, and have every illegal alien case reviewed by a judge to determine their future status,\u201d Cohen wrote. \u201cWe are a compassionate nation and illegal immigrants must follow our laws. Pass Kate\u2019s Law and end Sanctuary Cities.\u201d\n\nRegarding foreign policy and defense, Cohen said the United States must \u201cavoid foreign entanglements\u201d \u2013 particularly in the Middle East, where \u201cour \u2018friends\u2019 soon become our enemies.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn light of the Paris attacks, close our borders to anyone suspected of association with ISIS or their beliefs, and search for \u2018sleeper cells,\u2019\u201d Cohen writes. \u201cThis type of \u2018profiling\u2019 is legal in times of war. I would have Congress formally \u2018declare war\u2019 on ISIS, as I believe the Constitution requires.\u201d\n\nCohen calls for repealing the Affordable Care Act \u2013 \u201cIt\u2019s bound to fail, anyway. Start again with a free-market solution.\u201d He\u2019s anti-abortion but says \u201cthe federal government has no business being in your doctor\u2019s office\u2026 I would fund birth control and education to reduce the demand for abortions\u2026 I will not support any federal funding of abortions.\u201d\n\nHe calls for eliminating the Department of Education, auditing the Federal Reserve, slashing business regulations, closing the Guantanamo Bay detention camp, imposing term limits on Congress, and freeing captive whales.\n\nOn gun control and gun rights, Cohen says \u201cAmericans have the right to be well-armed. More gun control laws are not the solution to school shootings. I sadly encourage more armed police and staff at schools. Pure evil must be met with force.\u201d\n\nAnd regarding low-income housing in the district, \u201cno more of these four or five story apartment blocks that we see being built,\u201d Cohen wrote. \u201cNot everyone can afford to live in the district and we should not take steps to make it possible. Our highways are already clogged full.\u201d\n\nEven if Cohen doesn\u2019t get many votes beyond the GOP base, that could be bad news for Ro Khanna, the Fremont Democrat now making his second bid to unseat Honda, D-San Jose. Khanna\u2019s campaign relies on building a coalition among moderate Democrats, independents and Republicans, and any votes Cohen gets would likely come out of Khanna\u2019s pocket.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Fremont Republican Ron Cohen, new to the race to unseat Rep.
