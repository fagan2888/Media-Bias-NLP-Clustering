Though the official launch of the Spring 2014 collections is scheduled for Thursday, some designers are trying to beat the heat of more than 300 collections scheduled to take be revealed by showing earlier in the week. So consider the de facto beginning to be\u2026today.\n\nWhat was once an insider-only event, with even cameras banned, is now full-on public, with many shows being livestreamed. Viewers at home will have better seats than many editors smashed into fifth-row seats at the catwalks. The Wall Street Journal and Speakeasy will post daily reports, photos and videos.\n\nThe folks at YouTube are preparing to bring much of it into our living rooms or onto our mobile phones at this YouTube Spotlight page. YouTube will be offering links to livestreams as well as a plethora of do-try-this-at-home videos on how to assemble looks seen on the runways and attain the latest hair and make up styles (Prediction: One hairdo we\u2019re likely to see is a continuance of the ponytail).\n\nOther places to keep up to date are to follow reviews and see photos at Style.com, and to follow the designers showing at Mercedes Benz Fashion Week at Lincoln Center, for shows at Milk Studios. Still shots from many runways can be found at NowFashion.\n\nAnd don\u2019t stop at New York. The collections will then move on the London, Milan, and Paris. (And then, if you really can\u2019t get enough, Moscow.)", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Some New York Fashion Week designers are trying to beat the heat of more than 300 collections scheduled to take be revealed by showing earlier in the week -- today.", "title": "New York Fashion Week: How To Watch Online", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2013/09/04/new-york-fashion-week-how-to-watch-online/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OB-YT685_nyfw_G_20130903184226.jpg"}, "site": "WSJspeakeasy", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Arts", "article.headline": "New York Fashion Week: How To Watch Online", "description": "Some New York Fashion Week designers are trying to beat the heat of more than 300 collections scheduled to take be revealed by showing earlier in the week -- today.", "article_section": "Arts", "author": "Christina Binkley", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Speakeasy Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Speakeasy", "article.summary": "Some New York Fashion Week designers are trying to beat the heat of more than 300 collections scheduled to take be revealed by showing earlier in the week -- today.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2013-09-04T04:00:21-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-138", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2013/09/04/new-york-fashion-week-how-to-watch-online/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-SEB-76730", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Arts", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Some New York Fashion Week designers are trying to beat the heat of more than 300 collections scheduled to take be revealed by showing earlier in the week -- today.", "title": "New York Fashion Week: How To Watch Online", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2013/09/04/new-york-fashion-week-how-to-watch-online/", "image": {"width": 553, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OB-YT685_nyfw_G_20130903184226.jpg", "height": 369}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Speakeasy", "article.id": "BL-SEB-76730", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2013-10-16T20:53:51-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc012\"", "article_summary": "Mercedes Benz Fashion Week A New York Fashion Week runway showNew York Fashion Week is upon us.\nOther places to keep up to date are to follow reviews and see photos at Style.com, and to follow the designers showing at Mercedes Benz Fashion Week at Lincoln Center, for shows at Milk Studios.\nThough the official launch of the Spring 2014 collections is scheduled for Thursday, some designers are trying to beat the heat of more than 300 collections scheduled to take be revealed by showing earlier in the week.\nViewers at home will have better seats than many editors smashed into fifth-row seats at the catwalks.\nWhat was once an insider-only event, with even cameras banned, is now full-on public, with many shows being livestreamed."}
