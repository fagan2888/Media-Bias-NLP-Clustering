With temperatures above freezing in the Upstate and things beginning to thaw out across the Carolinas, many are breaking out and enjoying what’s left of the snow.

This winter storm began as rain late Thursday night then transitioned onto snow over night on Friday. Friday morning into Friday afternoon saw a mix of sleet, rain, freezing rain and snow.

Finally, the snow came in full force Friday evening, coating the Carolinas in white. Many woke up to a winter wonderland early Saturday morning with some continuing to see flurries into the afternoon.

So the million dollar question on everyone’s mind is; How much snow did we actually get?
