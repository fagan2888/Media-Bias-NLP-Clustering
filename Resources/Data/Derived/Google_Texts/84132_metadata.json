The challenge is a major one for co-ops, which were created and funded by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act \u201cIt\u2019s not for the faint of heart,\u201d Corlette said.Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley sent a letter to the CMS (PDF) earlier this month, demanding answers to how CoOportunity could have faltered. Congressional Republicans have criticized Obamacare\u2019s co-ops as a waste of taxpayer money. Some have compared them to Solyndra, a solar-panel company financed through public money that went belly up in 2011.Supporters of co-ops, however, say it\u2019s difficult to draw conclusions from one failed attempt. \u201cThe news about CoOportunity Health is not a statement on the health insurance co-op program or the co-op concept; it\u2019s a reflection on the fact that all insurers\u2014not just co-ops\u2014are operating in unique markets with unique business plans and varying state regulations,\u201d Dr. Martin Hickey, board chair of the National Alliance of State Health Co-Ops, said in a statement.Corlette agreed, saying CoOportunity\u2019s closure and Community Health Alliance\u2019s enrollment freeze are not an indictment of the entire co-op effort.\u201cWhen you\u2019ve seen one co-op, you\u2019ve seen one co-op,\u201d Corlette said. \u201cI\u2019d be cautious about necessarily assuming that they are all in the same boat, or have the same cash flow issues.\u201dCoOportunity\u2019s demise officially started Dec. 24, when Iowa Insurance Commissioner Nick Gerhart took over the insurer and studied it to see if it could be saved. CoOportunity, which enrolled many sick, higher-cost people, lost $45.7 million in the first 10 months of last year, and predicted it would not receive $60 million under the ACA\u2019s risk-corridor provision.Iowa\u2019s insurance department said Friday that CoOportunity\u2019s \u201cmedical claims currently exceed cash on hand.\u201d The company\u2019s assets will be liquidated by Feb. 28, and its more than 100,000 members have until March 1 to find an alternative health plan. The ACA\u2019s normal open-enrollment period for this year ends Feb. 15. Members\u2019 premium and cost-sharing subsidies will stop if they do not find a new carrier, the state said.Iowa has three other options\u2014Aetna\u2019s Coventry Health Care, Avera Health Plans and Gundersen Health Plan\u2014but Coventry is the only option in several larger markets. Wellmark Blue Cross and Blue Shield, the state\u2019s largest insurer, does not sell exchange plans and instead has benefited from the ACA provision that allows consumers to keep non-grandfathered health plans until 2016.In Tennessee, Community Health Alliance said last week that individuals and small groups could no longer buy its health plans based on its \u201cfinancial conditions and projections.\u201d The freeze, expected to last at least six months, does not mean the state has taken over the alliance, which is still able to pay its medical claims.Follow Bob Herman on Twitter: @MHbherman", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#0a365e", "description": "The Iowa Insurance Division said Friday that not-for-profit health insurer CoOportunity Health could not be saved and ordered its liquidation by the end of February.", "title": "Iowa declares the demise of CoOportunity Health", "og": {"site_name": "Modern Healthcare", "description": "The Iowa Insurance Division said Friday that not-for-profit health insurer CoOportunity Health could not be saved and ordered its liquidation by the end of February.", "title": "Iowa declares the demise of CoOportunity Health", "url": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20150123/NEWS/301239946", "image": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/modernhealthcare/mh-logo/master/mh-logo-fb-lg.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com", "description": "The Iowa Insurance Division said Friday that not-for-profit health insurer CoOportunity Health could not be saved and ordered its liquidation by the end of February.", "title": "Iowa declares the demise of CoOportunity Health", "image": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/modernhealthcare/mh-logo/master/mh-logo-twitter.jpg", "creator": "@modrnhealthcr", "site": "@modrnhealthcr", "card": "summary"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Modern Healthcare", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "url": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20150123/NEWS/301239946", "published_at": "2015-01-23", "msapplication-TileImage": "https:/raw.githubusercontent.com/modernhealthcare/mh-logo/master/ms-touch-icon-144x144-precomposed.png", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "image": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/modernhealthcare/mh-logo/master/mh-logo-g-plus.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd00f9\"", "article_summary": "Congressional Republicans have criticized Obamacare\u2019s co-ops as a waste of taxpayer money.\nMembers\u2019 premium and cost-sharing subsidies will stop if they do not find a new carrier, the state said.Iowa has three other options\u2014Aetna\u2019s Coventry Health Care, Avera Health Plans and Gundersen Health Plan\u2014but Coventry is the only option in several larger markets.\nThe ACA\u2019s normal open-enrollment period for this year ends Feb. 15.\nSome have compared them to Solyndra, a solar-panel company financed through public money that went belly up in 2011.Supporters of co-ops, however, say it\u2019s difficult to draw conclusions from one failed attempt.\n\u201cI\u2019d be cautious about necessarily assuming that they are all in the same boat, or have the same cash flow issues.\u201dCoOportunity\u2019s demise officially started Dec. 24, when Iowa Insurance Commissioner Nick Gerhart took over the insurer and studied it to see if it could be saved."}
