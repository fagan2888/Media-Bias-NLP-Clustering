It\u2019s rare for a diagnostic product to win deep coverage so fast; Xpresys Lung launched in October 2013. \u201cIt usually takes companies three years to get this kind of traction,\u201d says Indi chief business officer Jim Garner. \u201cWe don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s done it as quickly.\u201d\n\nFounded in 2009 by genomics pioneer Lee Hood, Indi has raised north of $60 million in venture capital from the likes of Baird Capital, InterWest Partners, and the Wellcome Trust.\n\nUnited officials were unavailable for comment. But it\u2019s fairly clear what United and the PPOs see: a chance to prevent a battery of invasive and expensive tests that are often called for when a scan detects lung growths between 8 and 30 millimeters across. That indeterminate size is difficult to assess for malignancy. Taking lung biopsies\u2014there are a few methods\u2014are expensive procedures not without serious risk. Xpresys Lung aims to give a more definitive answer and steer a big percentage of people with indeterminate nodules into the \u201cbenign\u201d category. It measures for levels of 11 proteins in a blood sample; their identity is Indi\u2019s trade secret.\n\nThe test is a negative predictor; that is, Xpresys Lung will determine if those nodules are benign, but it will not confirm a cancer diagnosis. \u201cI think we\u2019re seeing more of this type of test that helps avoid medical interventions that are expensive and risky for the patient,\u201d said Scott Allocco, a consultant who specializes in personalized medicine, reimbursement, and diagnostics. (He does not have ties to Indi.)\n\nUntil the Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare, there was less incentive for the U.S. healthcare system to pay for tests that kept patients away from drugs and medical interventions. Much of the talk around diagnostics has been in the context of personalized medicine, and getting drug company support for companion diagnostics that identify patients who will respond well to a drug. One example is vemurafenib (Zelboraf), a melanoma treatment for people with a genetic mutation called BRAF V600E; it was approved in 2011 along with a test that identifies BRAF V600E-positive patients.\n\nWith the approval of vemurafenib and other targeted cancer drugs that year, an Xconomy headline declared, \u201cThe cancer drug dark ages are coming to an end.\u201d\n\nNo less significant would be the avoidance of thousands of unnecessary and costly medical procedures in the first place. Of the 3 million patients who present with lung nodules in the U.S. each year, 20 to 27 percent have nodules in the indeterminate range. About half of those patients go down the biopsy route, but when they do the median cost of all those interventions is $35,000, Indi\u2019s Garner said, although he cautions that the numbers are approximate and represent early data.\n\nThe way Indi arrived at those data, however early, is an interesting part of the insurance coverage story. One reason United made its decision so quickly is because Indi kept United in the loop and even solicited feedback.\n\nTo convince United that the benefits of coverage outweighed the costs, Indi used some of its venture war chest to conduct a chart review study of 3,000 patients with lung nodules. (It was retrospective, meaning they amalgamated data from the patients\u2019 charts, hence the name \u201cchart review study.\u201d)\n\nUnited didn\u2019t conduct its own study to verify the data, which at first seemed odd to me, until Joseph Ferrara, a consultant in Boston who worked with Indi on its strategy, pointed out that insurers who cover drugs don\u2019t reconstruct pharmaceutical clinical trials.\n\n\u201cWe found the management of these module patients wasn\u2019t well understood in the [scientific] literature, nor could a payer look at claims data and discern how patients with nodules were managed,\u201d said Ferrara. \u201c[Indi\u2019s] study was perceived as robust.\u201d\n\nIndi has been charging $4,250 for the test, but none of the parties involved would discuss whether that would change with insurance coverage, or how much it would be reimbursed. Typically, a diagnostics company\u2019s list price is the starting point of a negotiation with payers. Foundation Medicine (NASDAQ: FMI), for instance, has been getting about $3,600 for its FoundationOne tests, even though they are listed at $5,800 (FoundationOne, however, isn\u2019t covered by United yet).\n\nThe standards for coverage also tend to vary from payer to payer. Garner said that United\u2019s Lee Newcomer, the insurer\u2019s senior vice president responsible for oncology, genetics, and women\u2019s health, declared early in the discussions with Indi that he needed to see either 10 percent cost savings or 10 percent improvement in health outcomes. \u201cWe showed 10 percent on both sides,\u201d said Garner.\n\nNext up is Medicare, a tougher nut to crack. A diagnostic expert at one regional Medicare contractor has already told Indi not to go for Medicare coverage with retrospective data. So Indi will submit clinical trial data by the end of this year, with a Medicare decision possible as soon as next year. The six PPOs that have contracted with Indi are MultiPlan, FedMed, Fortified Provider Network, InterWest Health, Stratose, and Three Rivers Provider Network.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Xconomy", "description": "One year after launching its first product, Seattle's Integrated Diagnostics has secured insurance coverage from several healthcare groups, including Unite", "title": "In Short Order, Indi Convinces Insurers To Cover Its Lung Test | Xconomy", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.xconomy.com/wordpress/wp-content/images/2013/09/indi1.png", "updated_time": "2014-11-05T08:32:55+00:00", "url": "http://www.xconomy.com/seattle/2014/11/05/in-short-order-indi-convinces-insurers-to-cover-its-lung-test/", "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "kB8sd1DYBBxgDN18IeVmM224YUBB03iZS3Z3kL6qXBw", "twitter": {"domain": "Xconomy", "description": "One year after launching its first product, Seattle's Integrated Diagnostics has secured insurance coverage from several healthcare groups, including Unite", "title": "In Short Order, Indi Convinces Insurers To Cover Its Lung Test | Xconomy", "image": {"src": "http://www.xconomy.com/wordpress/wp-content/images/2013/09/indi1.png"}, "creator": "@alexlash", "site": "@xconomy", "card": "summary"}, "description": "One year after launching its first product, Seattle's Integrated Diagnostics has secured insurance coverage from several healthcare groups, including Unite", "article": {"section": "National blog main", "tag": "Xpresys Lung", "published_time": "2014-11-05T08:30:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-05T08:32:55+00:00"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdac75\"", "article_summary": "It\u2019s rare for a diagnostic product to win deep coverage so fast; Xpresys Lung launched in October 2013.\nIn Short Order, Indi Convinces Insurers To Cover Its Lung TestXconomy Seattle \u2014One year after launching its first product, Seattle\u2019s Integrated Diagnostics has secured insurance coverage from several healthcare groups, including UnitedHealthCare (NYSE: UNH).\nXpresys Lung aims to give a more definitive answer and steer a big percentage of people with indeterminate nodules into the \u201cbenign\u201d category.\nThe test is a negative predictor; that is, Xpresys Lung will determine if those nodules are benign, but it will not confirm a cancer diagnosis.\nOf the 3 million patients who present with lung nodules in the U.S. each year, 20 to 27 percent have nodules in the indeterminate range."}
