He also owns two Corvettes and a Ford Bronco.\n\nJosh Williams clutched a warm drink and shot the breeze with fellow car buffs a few feet from his red 2005 Ferrari F360, as the weekly Cars and Coffee cruise-in wound down Dec. 19.\n\nNearby were a 15-year-old BMW M5 and a turbocharged 2000 Chevrolet Corvette.\n\n\u201cI have a few different cars,\u201d said Williams, noting he also owns a 1974 Ford Bronco and 1978 and 2003 Corvettes.\n\nWith such a variety of vintage vehicles, the car fan sometimes bases his motoring decision on the weather. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice day, not raining, you know,\u201d said Williams in choosing the Ferrari, which he accidentally dubbed an F430. \u201cI\u2019ve wanted the F430,\u201d he acknowledged.\n\nWilliams joined a few dozen auto collectors at the weekly event 8-11 a.m. at Mount Pleasant Towne Centre shopping plaza.\n\nThe East Cooper cruise-in isn\u2019t the sole Saturday morning car gathering in the Charleston area but it\u2019s been among the most consistent, held almost without fail for more than four consecutive years in at least three locations along U.S. Highway 17 North and off Coleman Boulevard.\n\n\u201cI wake up early (anyway),\u201d said Adam Beebe, who brought his BMW 540 and looked over cars with auto fan Will Boehland. Collectors can sip coffee and walk around checking out a diverse group of vehicles to see what\u2019s \u201cnew and exciting,\u201d Beebe said.\n\nAttendees can \u201chang out (and) talk with folks,\u201d Boehland added.\n\nLast Saturday, BMWs, \u2019Vettes and Ford Mustangs \u2014 including a 1966 vintage coupe and a Shelby Cobra \u2014 were among the most populated brands at the cruise-in.\n\nWes Bird arrived with his pet husky Koda in tow in a high performance turn-of-the-21st-century Corvette churning out 700 horsepower at the wheels. He said the coupe was \u201camong the fastest here.\u201d\n\nEven so, Bird said he plans further tinkering with the \u2018Vette, which is his daily driver. \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d he said. Bird wants to tweak the engine some more, and \u201cgo for 1,000 (hp).\u201d\n\nReach Jim Parker at 843-937-5542 or jparker@postandcourier.com.\n\nupe", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Mount Pleasant morning drive-up draws weekly exposure, \r\nAutomotive,", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "Josh Williams clutched a warm drink and shot the breeze with fellow car buffs a few feet from his red 2005 Ferrari F360, as the weekly Cars and Coffee cruise-in wound down Dec. 19.", "title": "Mount Pleasant morning drive-up draws weekly exposure", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20151226/151229546/mount-pleasant-morning-drive-up-draws-weekly-exposure", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20151226/PC2107/151229546/AR/0/AR-151229546.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20151226/PC2107/151229546/AR/0/AR-151229546.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Josh Williams clutched a warm drink and shot the breeze with fellow car buffs a few feet from his red 2005 Ferrari F360, as the weekly Cars and Coffee cruise-in wound down Dec. 19.", "title": "Mount Pleasant morning drive-up draws weekly exposure", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@postandcourier", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20151226/PC2107/151229546/AR/0/AR-151229546.jpg?201512271644", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 151229546}}, "keywords": "Mount Pleasant morning drive-up draws weekly exposure , \r\nAutomotive", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-26T13:13:47Z", "modified_time": "2015-12-27T16:44:00Z", "author": "Jim Parker"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "Josh Williams clutched a warm drink and shot the breeze with fellow car buffs a few feet from his red 2005 Ferrari F360, as the weekly Cars and Coffee cruise-in wound down Dec. 19."}, "article_summary": "Josh Williams shows off his 2005 Ferrari F360 at Cars and Coffee last Saturday in Mount Pleasant.\nWilliams joined a few dozen auto collectors at the weekly event 8-11 a.m. at Mount Pleasant Towne Centre shopping plaza.\nWith such a variety of vintage vehicles, the car fan sometimes bases his motoring decision on the weather.\n\u201cI have a few different cars,\u201d said Williams, noting he also owns a 1974 Ford Bronco and 1978 and 2003 Corvettes.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a nice day, not raining, you know,\u201d said Williams in choosing the Ferrari, which he accidentally dubbed an F430."}
