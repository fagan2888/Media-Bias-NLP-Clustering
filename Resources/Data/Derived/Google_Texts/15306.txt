With the temperatures in Wichita dropping as winter approaches, the homeless will have a warm place to stay.

Saturday was the opening night of a Inter-Faith Ministries winter shelter in downtown Wichita.

"Because it's so windy and chilly I would guess anywhere from 40-60 men will be at the men's shelter and another 5-10 at the women's shelter," said Inter-Faith Ministries Director, Anne Corriston.

The check-in desk at the center had a constant flow as the homeless were assigned mattresses. Bill Alhalabi has been homeless for months, he said the past few freezing nights make him thankful this shelter is available.

"When the sun starts going down it just gets worse and worse and worse. But if you don't find a place warm to sleep, you're up the creek," said Alhalabi.

The first night had volunteers rushing to make sure everyone was fed. It was also the beginning of a big change, if homeless are going to stay they have to be checked in by midnight.

"What we found was that the later it got the more intoxicated many of the guests were so that just kind of disturbs the peace of the folks here who are trying to sleep," said Corriston.

The main goal at the shelter never changes, to help homeless work toward finding permanent housing and jobs.

"I see this building as the gateway to being able to help people have a permanent situation in their lives," said Corriston.

Through new grants, this year the organization will also provide health care education programs and flu shots to the homeless.
