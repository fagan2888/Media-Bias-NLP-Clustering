Why Harris County takes care of its own — papers or no papers Rogelio's kidneys. Ben Taub. And the riddle of American health care.

It is June in Houston and unseasonably dry, at least at 5:45 in the morning. Outside Ben Taub Hospital in the day’s first light, you can just begin to make out the forms of people sleeping on benches in the park across the street, patients still in paper scrubs who’ve been discharged but who have nowhere else to go. At this hour, inside the emergency room, the scene isn’t all that different. People lingering in the trauma center’s waiting room look less like anxious family members waiting for updates and more like passengers at a snowed-in airport. The blankets are out, CNN runs muted in the background, and anyone able to sleep does so across a row of vinyl armchairs. At one end of the waiting room, the triage nurse sits beside the vital-signs machine. Typically, I never see her. “Where are the ESRDers?” I ask, meaning the patients who are here because of end-stage renal disease. She sweeps her arm across the room. “Everywhere,” she says. “Where do we line them up?”
