That is why the electability of Jokowi is decreasing significantly,\" said Burhanuddin Muhtadi, the executive director of pollster Indonesian Political Indicator, which surveyed thousands of potential voters on the topic.\n\nJokowi's party, the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle, recently posted a photo on social media showing the candidate among Haj pilgrims in 2003, proof, it said, that he is Muslim.\n\nMeanwhile, some of Jokowi's supporters have stepped up their own negative campaigning against Prabowo.\n\nWimar Witoelar, a Jokowi supporter and former spokesman of former president Abdurrahman Wahid, apologized last week for posting on his Twitter and Facebook accounts a picture of Prabowo's team alongside Osama bin Laden and other militants, according to the Jakarta Post.\n\nAttacks against Prabowo have also included questions about his mental well-being and claims that he is a Jordanian citizen.\n\nBut the majority of the negative campaigning has been on Prabowo's human rights record as a top general, in particular during unrest that brought down his former father-in-law and long-serving autocrat Suharto in 1998.\n\nWiranto, Prabowo's former military boss and now a leader of a small party backing Jokowi, has released details of a military council's findings which said Prabowo had deliberately misinterpreted orders and told troops who were not under his command to arrest political activists. [ID:nL4N0P0278]\n\nWiranto insisted that he was not making the announcement in his capacity as a politician.\n\nFace to face, the two candidates have been the epitome of civility. At two presidential debates, they have hugged and shaken hands and left it to their vice presidential running mates to attack the other.\n\nMuhtadi, from the polling agency, said the attacks on Prabowo's human rights record were not as effective as the smear campaign against Jokowi because the former general's past was already largely known.\n\n\"Prabowo's human rights issues are not really influencing voter behavior when compared to the black campaign against Jokowi,\" Muhtadi said.\n\n\"This is why it is hard to predict who will be the winner in the next election.\"\n\n(Editing by Raju Gopalakrishnan)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Randy Fabi", "Author": "Randy Fabi", "DCSext.PageNumber": 1, "twitter": {"description": "One of the two hopefuls in Indonesia's presidential election has been accused of being a closet Christian, the other of being a foreigner and unfit to lead the nation.", "creator": "@Reuters", "image": "http://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20140622&t=2&i=910481162&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=LYNXMPEA5L026", "title": "Mud flung as Indonesia presidential race heats up", "site": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "DCSext.rChannel": "Article -
