JWCH case managers then will work to connect the patients to long-term housing and needed medical care.\n\n\u201cStudies have consistently shown that housing is the anchor for effectively delivering health care to the homeless population,\u201d said Al Ballesteros, chief executive officer of JWCH. \u201cIf we can address the very basic need for housing, then we can begin addressing the medical and social service needs of the homeless population.\u201d\n\nOPCC\n\nNon-profit social services agency OPCC provides housing and comprehensive, fully integrated medical, mental health and substance abuse treatment for the homeless in Santa Monica and the Westside of Los Angeles County.\n\nUnder its grant, OPCC will assign a staffer to the Providence Saint John\u2019s Medical Center emergency department to assist in moving homeless patients into housing and connect them to needed outpatient medical services, either at Venice Family Clinic or with local physicians.\n\n\u201cMany homeless people are frequent utilizers of the emergency department, contributing to a costly and repetitive cycle of services on an already overburdened system,\u201d said John Maceri, executive director of OPCC. \u201cThrough this pilot, we hope to demonstrate that a modest investment in a care coordinator can help stabilize these individuals\u2019 health, improve their quality of life and help save avoidable costs to the entire system.\u201d\n\nAbout Health Net\n\nHealth Net, Inc.
