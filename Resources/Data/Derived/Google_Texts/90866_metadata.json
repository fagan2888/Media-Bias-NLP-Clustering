The move would advance new learning goals, called the Common Core, which are less focused on memorizing facts. They are designed instead to develop critical thinking and writing skills that take formerly separate subjects \u2014 such as English and history or writing and chemistry \u2014 and link them. Forty-five states have adopted these standards.\n\nClick the link to read more about the clusterfuckish nature of this whole thing. But regardless of how you feel about Common Core, why the switch to computerized tests? Can't you test Common Core knowledge using pencil and paper? Beats me. But it's apparently going to cost the LA school district some serious money. Here's a story from yesterday:\n\nLos Angeles school officials are acknowledging a new looming cost in a $1-billion effort to provide iPads to every student: keyboards. Officials so far have not budgeted that expense, but they said the wireless keyboards are recommended for students when they take new state standardized tests.\n\nWhen I read that, I wondered why they suddenly needed iPads to take standardized tests. I guess now I know. Sort of.\n\nIn any case, I'd like to open up this thread to teachers or anyone else who wants to weigh in on the benefit of giving every kid an iPad. I think this is just about the most colossally dumb use of money I've come across in a long time. But naturally I want to keep an open mind. So educate me.
