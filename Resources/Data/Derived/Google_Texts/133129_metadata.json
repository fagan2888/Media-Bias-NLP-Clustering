Generally speaking, they prefer shallow relationships (preferably one-way, with the arrow pointing toward themselves), and need outside sources to maintain their inflated but delicate egos. So, a shallow cave that you can get into, but not out of. The Internet offers both a vast potential audience, and the possibility for anonymity, and if not anonymity, then a carefully curated veneer of self that you can attach your name to. In 1987, the psychologists Hazel Markus and Paula Nurius claimed that a person has two selves: the \u201cnow self\u201d and the \u201cpossible self.\u201d The Internet allows a person to become her \u201cpossible self,\u201d or at least present a version of herself that is closer to it. When it comes to studies of online narcissism, and there have been many, social media dominates the discussion. One 2010 study notes that the emergence of the possible self \u201cis most pronounced in anonymous online worlds, where accountability is lacking and the \u2018true\u2019 self can come out of hiding.\u201d But non-anonymous social networks like Facebook, which this study was analyzing, \u201cprovide an ideal environment for the expression of the \u2018hoped-for possible self,\u2019 a subgroup of the possible-self. This state emphasizes realistic socially desirable identities an individual would like to establish given the right circumstances.\u201d When you\u2019re introduced to someone in person, it\u2019s unlikely that they\u2019ll bust out with a pithy sound bite that attempts to sum up all that they are and all they hope to be. The study, which found that people higher in narcissism were more active on Facebook, points out that you tend to encounter \u201cidentity statements\u201d on social networks more than you would in real life. When you\u2019re introduced to someone in person, it\u2019s unlikely that they\u2019ll bust out with a pithy sound bite that attempts to sum up all that they are and all they hope to be, but people do that in their Twitter bio or Facebook \u201cAbout Me\u201d section all the time. Science has linked narcissism with high levels of activity on Facebook, Twitter, and Myspace (back in the day). But it's important to narrow in farther and distinguish what kinds of activity the narcissists are engaging in, since hours of scrolling through your news feed, though time-wasting, isn\u2019t exactly self-centered. And people post online for different reasons. For example, Twitter has been shown to sometimes fulfill a need to connect with others. The trouble with determining what's normal and what's narcissism is that both sets of people generally engage in the same online behaviors, they just have different motives for doing so.\n\nA recent study published in Computers in Human Behavior dug into the how and why of narcissists\u2019 social media use, looking at both college students and an older adult population. The researchers measured how often people tweeted or updated their Facebook status, but also why, asking them how much they agreed with statements like \u201cIt is important that my followers admire me,\u201d and \u201cIt is important that my profile makes others want to be my friend.\u201d Overall, Twitter use was more correlated with narcissism, but lead researcher Shaun W. Davenport, chair of management and entrepreneurship at High Point University, points out that there was a key difference between generations. Older narcissists were more likely to take to Facebook, whereas younger narcissists were more active on Twitter. \"For older adults who didn't grow up using Facebook, it takes more intentional motives to use it, like narcissism.\" \u201cFacebook has really been around the whole time Generation Y was growing up and they see it more as a tool for communication,\u201d Davenport says. \u201cThey use it like other generations use the telephone\u2026 For older adults who didn\u2019t grow up using Facebook, it takes more intentional motives [to use it], like narcissism.\u201d Whereas on Facebook, the friend relationship is reciprocal, you don\u2019t have to follow someone on Twitter who follows you (though it is often polite to do so, if you are the sort of person who thinks of Twitter more as an elegant tea room than, I don\u2019t know, someplace without rules or scruples, like the Wild West or a suburban Chuck E. Cheese). Rather than friend-requesting people to get them to pay attention to you, the primary method to attract Twitter followers is just\u2026 tweeting, which partially explains the correlation between number of tweets and narcissism. Of course, there\u2019s something to be said for quality over quantity\u2014just look at @OneTweetTony and his 2,000+ followers. And you\u2019d think that, even if you gather a lot of followers to you through sheer volume of content spewed, eventually some would tire of your face\u2019s constant presence in their feed and leave you. W. Keith Campbell, head of the University of Georgia's psychology department and author of The Narcissism Epidemic: Living in the Age of Entitlement, says that people don't actually make the effort to unfriend or unfollow someone that often, though.\n\n\u201cWhat you find in real life with narcissists is that they\u2019re very good at gaining friends and becoming leaders, but eventually people see through them and stop liking them,\u201d he says. \u201cOnline, people are very good at gaining relationships, but they don\u2019t fall off naturally. If you\u2019re incredibly annoying, they just ignore you, and even then it might be worth it for entertainment value. There\u2019s a reason why, on reality TV, you find high levels of narcissism. It\u2019s entertaining.\u201d Also like reality TV stars, narcissists like their own images. They show a preference for posting photos on Facebook, but Campbell clarifies that it\u2019s the type of photos that matter\u2014narcissists tend to choose more attractive, attention-seeking photos. In another 2011 study, narcissistic adolescents rated their own profile pictures as \u201cmore physically attractive, more fashionable, more glamorous, and more cool than their less narcissistic peers did.\u201d The concrete goals and rewards online role playing games offer allow the players to gather prestige. Though social media is an obvious and much-discussed bastion of narcissism, online role-playing games, the most famous being World of Warcraft, have been shown to hold some attraction as well. A study of 1,471 Korean online gamers showed narcissists to be more likely to be addicted to the games than non-narcissists. The concrete goals and rewards the games offer allow the players to gather prestige: \u201cAs you play, your character advances by gaining experience points, \u2018leveling-up\u2019 from one level to the next while collecting valuables and weapons and becoming wealthier and stronger,\u201d the study reads. \u201cIn this social setting, excellent players receive the recognition and attention of others, and gain power and status.\u201d And if that power comes through violence, so much the better. Narcissism has been linked to aggression, another reason for the games\u2019 appeal. Offline, narcissists are often bullies, though attempts to link narcissism to cyberbullying have resulted in a resounding \"maybe.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "Studies have shown narcissists post more self-promoting content on social media, but it&#39;s not always so easy to tell if someone&#39;s doing it for the attention.", "author": "Julie Beck", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "Studies have shown narcissists post more self-promoting content on social media, but it&#39;s not always so easy to tell if someone&#39;s doing it for the attention.", "title": "How to Spot a Narcissist Online", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2014/01/2349782556_fb1e5d7502_o/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/01/how-to-spot-a-narcissist-online/283099/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "When it comes to studies of online narcissism, and there have been many, social media dominates the discussion.\nA study of 1,471 Korean online gamers showed narcissists to be more likely to be addicted to the games than non-narcissists.\nScience has linked narcissism with high levels of activity on Facebook, Twitter, and Myspace (back in the day).\nNeilsPhotography/flickr It\u2019s not hard to see why the Internet would be a good cave for a narcissist to burrow into.\nThough social media is an obvious and much-discussed bastion of narcissism, online role-playing games, the most famous being World of Warcraft, have been shown to hold some attraction as well."}
