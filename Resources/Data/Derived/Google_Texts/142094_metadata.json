They say the utilities are trying to eliminate competition.\n\nStu Dalheim, vice president at Calvert Investments out of Bethesda, Md., recently wrote that Wisconsin and its utilities have a choice to make: \u201cembrace competition or lose out on investment.\u201d\n\nThe real choice/decision is: Do we allow on-site generation in the current business model that permits third-party investors, such as Dalheim, to earn on their investments at the expense of local customers who will be forced to pay more than their fair share of electric grid costs?\n\nIt isn\u2019t a competition issue. WPS has explored the possibility of getting involved in on-site generation. But, under the current rate structure it would still result in non-participating customers subsidizing those who have on-site generation.\n\nSimply put, WPS does not wish to take \u201cadvantage\u201d of the \u201crevolution\u201d Dalheim supports because that advantage is gained at the cost of our non-participating customers \u2014 those customers who can\u2019t afford (solar systems can cost $15,000-$20,000) or aren\u2019t interested in on-site generation. It\u2019s a fairness issue.\n\nUtilities have a significant investment in, and responsibility for, the construction, maintenance, operation, and repair of the distribution and transmission systems that bring electricity to the customer\u2019s door.\n\nThese fixed costs are necessary to deliver a reliable supply of energy to all customers regardless of a customer\u2019s energy use.\n\nSolar customers are connected to the grid and need energy in the evening, when the sun doesn\u2019t shine or when their demand exceeds their ability to produce power. Today, customers who do not have their own system pay a greater share of the cost of maintaining a reliable grid \u2014 the poles, wires, crews, transformers, meters, customer service programs, and more \u2014 needed to keep energy flowing every hour of every day.\n\nFor example, if on-site generators get to zero use, all they pay is the current monthly fixed charge of $10.40. The remaining fixed costs are picked up by everyone else, including low-income customers. It isn\u2019t fair to our customers who don\u2019t have their own energy system to subsidize those who do.\n\nUtilities fulfill the responsibility of maintaining the grid through a fixed charge and a use charge per unit of energy consumed. WPS and other utilities are proposing an increase in the fixed charge of customers\u2019 bills and a decrease in the use charge.\n\nIt is not a penalty for those with on-site generation. It is simply including more of the fixed costs in a fixed charge \u2014 for all. It will help to ensure that customers with on-site generation are paying more of their fair share and to lower the subsidies that other customers are currently paying for those who own their own generating systems.\n\nThis proposed structure is not new in the energy business. For years, member-owned electric cooperatives have included higher fixed charges on their bills \u2014 in the $25-$35 range and higher. Most WPS customers will see little change in their electric bill.\n\nThe new rate structure is based on a simple theory: Everyone should pay equally for the fixed costs of the electric grid. It\u2019s a fairness issue.\n\nPatrick Schillinger is assistant vice president-regulatory affairs for Integrys Energy Group.
