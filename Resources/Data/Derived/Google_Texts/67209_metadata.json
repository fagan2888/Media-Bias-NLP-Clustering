Paul, the rebel, has gotten along fine with his fellow Republicans. Cruz, the Ivy-laureled resume-builder, has managed to infuriate the power structure.\n\nThat\u2019s been quite out of character for both men. When Cruz arrived in Washington last year, it was assumed he would bring a moderating influence to the Tea Party, or at least serve as a bridge between it and the GOP establishment. Yes, he had run an insurgent campaign in Texas\u2019s Republican primary\u2014beating the establishment choice, poor old David Dewhurst\u2014but, prior to that run, Cruz had spent years comfortably working within that establishment, from his college days at Princeton to Harvard Law School to a Supreme Court clerkship to the Bush administration to the Supreme Court bar. His CV revealed a man who possessed an impressive skill for navigating powerful institutions and, not unrelatedly, ingratiating himself to institutional power. He\u2019d seek out one mentor who\u2019d then introduce him to a new one. Chuck Cooper, the eminent conservative lawyer whose firm once employed a young Cruz, once recalled to me, \u201cTed had clerked for Rehnquist and I had as well, and before that he\u2019d clerked for Mike Luttig, who\u2019s a very close friend of mine, so it was through them that Ted really came to my attention.\u201d In other words, Cruz had climbed the greasy pole through his relationships.\n\nBut since Cruz has gotten to the Senate, he\u2019s done a complete 180. Far from trying to work within the institution and suck up to power, he\u2019s sought to blow up the former and piss off the latter\u2014whether it was his fight over Obamacare that resulted in a government shutdown last fall or, just last month, his use of a procedural maneuver that essentially forced the Senate Republican leadership to vote for a \u201cclean\u201d debt-ceiling increase. Meanwhile, despite the fact that Cruz is the National Republican Senatorial Committee\u2019s vice chairman for grassroots outreach, he\u2019s refused to endorse his Senate colleagues Mitch McConnell, Pat Roberts, and Thad Cochran in their primary fights. In general, Cruz has appeared to go out of his way to tick off the powers that be in the most petty, pointless, and personal manner possible. \u201cThey don\u2019t keep Senate records about this kind of thing,\u201d John Dickerson wrote last fall, \u201cbut it\u2019s likely that no senator has created as many enemies in his party in as short a time as the junior senator from Texas.\u201d\n\nIn other words,Cruz is behaving the way everyone assumed Rand Paul would. Before Paul arrived in the Senate in 2011, he\u2019d spent much of his life being a pain in the ass. As a college student at Baylor who loved to tweak the conservative (and religiously devout) administration; as an ophthalmologist who founded a renegade ophthalmological organization to protest the certification rules of the medical specialty\u2019s long-established professional group; as an insurgent Tea Party candidate who ran against the Kentucky GOP establishment\u2019s (and Mitch McConnell\u2019s) handpicked candidate, Paul was a man who thumbed his nose at institutions and institutional power.\n\nAnd yet, in the Senate, he\u2019s tried to be a team player\u2014especially when it\u2019s come to his relationship with his fellow Kentucky Senator and Republican leader McConnell, the man he was implicitly running against back in 2010. Before launching his drone filibuster last year, Paul made sure to clear the move with McConnell. Later, he provided McConnell some crucial Tea Party cover back home in Kentucky by not joining Cruz in his shutdown crusade. And, while Cruz has shirked his NRSC duties, Paul, according to an NRSC staffer, routinely shows up to make his fundraising calls for the group; more importantly, he has endorsed McConnell in his primary fight back in Kentucky (albeit maybe not always as wholeheartedly as he could have). All of which has endeared\u2014or, if not endeared, at least made Paul tolerable\u2014to large and unexpected swaths of the GOP establishment. When Mitt Romney hosted a political confab in Park City, Utah, last year, Paul was in attendance. (Cruz was not.) And Paul\u2019s efforts to play nice have even made some of his policy views more palatable to the GOP establishment. Just consider how sentencing reform has become an issue an increasing number of Republicans now embrace.\n\nIt\u2019s a bit too tidy, though, to conclude that what this all really means is that Paul is a personable guy and Cruz is a jerk.\n\nIn fact, Cruz\u2019s and Paul\u2019s behavior reflects the political bet each man is making. As Julia Ioffe wrote in her Paul profile last year, \u201cIf he wants to win the nomination, he needs the party\u2019s power brokers.\u201d In other words, Paul is adhering to the standard rule of GOP presidential primaries: Even though he\u2019s not running as the establishment candidate, he believes he can\u2019t win if the establishment is actively working against him. That\u2019s made Paul a more interesting\u2014and, so far, more effective\u2014Senator than his rival. As one advisor close to Paulworld once put it to me, \u201cRand came here not to be something but to do things.\u201d\n\nCruz clearly has taken a different approach, and the thing he most wants to be is the guy the establishment hates. Despite his sterling pedigree, he reads the political moment as such that having the establishment work against him is actually an advantage. And maybe he\u2019s right that this antipathy will help carry him all the way to the White House. Of course, at that point, he\u2019ll need new establishment help to get legislation through his old Capitol Hill stomping grounds\u2014which will offer another chance to see how much of his abrasive Senatorial style is genuine and how much of it is a calculation.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Everyone expected the Ivy League guy to suck up and Aqua Buddha guy to stick out.
