Corrine Brown.\n\nWhile Graham ran an admirable campaign against former U.S. Rep. Steve Southerland in the 2014 cycle, the new district lines make fellow Republican candidate Neil Dunn her toughest competition in the 2016 contest.\n\nDunn leads in fundraising and has picked up a few endorsements of his own, most notably from Southerland, who threw his support behind the Panama City urological surgeon in November.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Florida Politics", "description": "Tallahassee Republican Mary Thomas has picked up an endorsement from one of the\u00a0country\u2019s largest Tea Party organizations, her campaign said Tuesday.
