He noted that President Barack Obama swore to the American people that the bill would be deficit-neutral over the next 10 years, before pointing out that the CBO projects the law will cost about $1.8 trillion over the next decade alone.\n\nBeck also reminded listeners of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s assertion that millions of jobs would be created as the result of Obamacare, before noting the CBO has estimated the bill will cause 2 million fewer American workers starting in 2017, and millions more after that.\n\n\u201cYou knew we were being lied to,\u201d Beck said. \u201cI want somebody to finally recognize that the American people have been onto this for a long time. Trust yourself, empower yourself. Don\u2019t you listen to the press, don\u2019t you listen to the government, because they are wrong. And you know what? The government gets something out of it. The press has no excuse. They are lazy and ignorant.\u201d\n\nBeck re-read emails from listeners from 2009, all of whom said they would be unable to expand as planned, or would have to lay people off as the result of the new taxes, fines, and thousands of pages of regulation imposed by Obamacare.\n\n\u201cAll these people in Washington, they are all responsible,\u201d Beck said hotly. \u201cAll of them are responsible for the death of this economy, and you need to know.\u201d\n\nBeck said those who are opposed to Obamacare may be \u201cpowerless\u201d over the Democrats, but they are not powerless over the Republicans.\n\n\u201cYou want to continue the \u201ctransformation\u201d and go along happily, or do you want to stand and correct the aberration of history, that we are nothing more than dependents on some government parent?\u201d Beck asked. \u201cThat\u2019s the rest of the world \u2014 that\u2019s not America.\u201d\n\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nThe full episode of The Glenn Beck Program, along with many other live streaming shows and thousands of hours of on-demand content, is available on just about any digital device.
