Richard Drdul, CC BY-SA 2.0\n\nThe road is a riskier place for pedestrians who need a wheelchair to move around than it is for the average Joe, suggests a recent study published in BMJ Open this November.\n\nAnalyzing fatal crashes involving pedestrian wheelchair users from 2006 to 2012, the study authors found that their overall mortality rate via car accident was 36 percent higher than the general population. More particularly, wheelchair-bound men faced a fivefold higher risk than women, and among men aged 50 to 64, they saw a 75 percent increased risk than their similarly-aged but able-bodied counterparts. \u201cPersons who use wheelchairs experience substantial pedestrian mortality disparities, calling for behavioral and built environment interventions,\u201d the authors wrote.\n\nAn Increased Risk\n\nThe research team relied on two sources of data: the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS), operated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, and an exhaustive scouring of newspaper articles detailing car crashes through LexisNexis. the world\u2019s largest electronic database for public and legal records. This allowed them to not only cross-verify the hits that were found in each source, but also catch any accidents they missed.\n\nFinding an estimated 528 pedestrian wheelchair user fatalities in that time span, they then extrapolated a mortality rate of 2.07 per 100,000 person-years, compared to a 1.52 per 100,000 person-years in the general population. More simply, that means if we were to follow 100,000 pedestrians who use wheelchairs for a full year, we\u2019d expect to see around two car crash-related fatalities during that period. For wheelchair-bound men aged 50 to 64, however, we\u2019d see about 5 fatalities per 100,000 person-years.\n\nWhile these figures might not seem like a large number, it\u2019s worth remembering that there are (only) 5,000 pedestrian fatalities and another 76,000 injuries annually \u2014 and in the latter case, people with wheelchairs are more at risk as well. The researchers also note that their estimates are likely underestimating the true number of fatalities. Perhaps most importantly, however, is that these increased risks are largely preventable through improvements in how we drive and create our roads, according to the authors.\n\n\u201cSome improvements are general to road safety: reducing distracted driving and pedestrian activity, improving safe crossing behaviour, reducing incapacitated driving, and improving pedestrian infrastructure \u2014 all of which appear to have played a role in a significant number of fatal crashes identified in this study,\u201d they explained. \u201cOthers are specific to pedestrian risks faced by wheelchair users: low conspicuity of the wheelchair and pedestrian infrastructure that is particularly ill-suited to pedestrians who use wheelchairs.\u201d\n\nApart from making the roads safer for everyone, the changes may give people living with disability a peace of mind sorely needed.\n\n\u201cThese findings underscore the need for policymakers and planners to fully incorporate disability accommodations into pedestrian infrastructure and for persons who use wheelchairs\u2014and others with disabilities\u2014to remain a salient population when road safety interventions are designed,\u201d the authors concluded.\n\nSource: Kraemer J, Benton C.Disparities in road crash mortality among pedestrians using wheelchairs in the USA: results of a capture\u2013recapture analysis.
