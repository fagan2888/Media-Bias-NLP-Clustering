Among the most popular gifts this holiday season was the hoverboard, a self-balancing scooter on two wheels.

Despite their risks of serious personal injury and catching fire, CNBC reported earlier this month that consumers purchased more than 5,000 of them on Ebay on Black Friday alone.

Since early Christmas morning, social media has been buzzing with Tweets and videos of both children and full grown adults trying out their new hoverboards, and failing miserably.

The result... hilarious.
