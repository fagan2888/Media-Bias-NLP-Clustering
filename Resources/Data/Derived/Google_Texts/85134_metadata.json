The winner of the primary election, Diane Douglas, strongly opposed the standards, painting them as federal overreach and likening them to the education version of \u201cObamacare\u201d on her campaign website.\n\nHuppenthal\u2019s reelection campaign hit a major roadblock this year when it was revealed in June that he had been leaving comments on political blogs under the psydonyms \u201cFalcon9\u201d and \u201cThucydides\u201d containing remarks that many viewed as offensive.\n\nIn an apparent swipe against the mother tongue of many of his constituents, Huppenthal refused to capitalize the word \u201cSpanish\u201d in one of the comments.\n\nWe all need to stomp out balkanization. No spanish radio stations, no spanish billboards, no spanish tv stations, no spanish newspapers. This is America, speak English.\n\nHe also called people who use food stamps \u201clazy pigs.\u201d\n\nAfter getting caught, he apologized at a news conference before breaking into tears and abruptly walking away from the podium.\n\nPhoenix independent Luis Cardenas Camacho told the Arizona Republic that the comments had influenced his decision to vote against Huppenthal.\n\n\u201cHe needs to focus on education for children, and we have a high population of different ethnicities in our school system,\u201d Cardenas Camacho told the Arizona Republic. \u201cFor him to be that biased toward somebody, it\u2019s just not appropriate.\n\nHuppenthal leaves a Jan Brewer-esque legacy for Latino students who make up a majority of many of the state\u2019s school districts.\n\nAs a state senator, Huppenthal spearheaded legislation to ban courses targeted toward specific ethnicities, that promote \u201cethnic solidarity,\u201d or that advocate the \u201coverthrow of the government,\u201d which passed in 2010. The bill was aimed at a controversial Mexican-American Studies curriculum developed in Tucson public schools that conservatives accused of causing resentment toward whites.\n\nTeachers denied those charges and pointed to research showing the courses had bolstered student achievement and classroom engagement. The courses encouraged students to think critically about controversial issues like race and immigration, and used books routinely assigned at the university level, like Paulo Freire\u2019s Pedagogy of the Oppressed or Richard Delgado\u2019s Critical Race Theory.\n\nElected to head the Arizona public school system in 2010, Huppenthal commissioned an independent audit of the courses upon taking office. Though the audit praised the curriculum\u2019s focus on critical thinking and recommended expanding the courses, Huppenthal ordered Tucson Unified School District to suspend them or face the loss of 10 percent of the district\u2019s funding -- some $14 million annually.\n\nThe district then banned seven books from classrooms that had been used as part of the curriculum, arguing that they had been named in a lawsuit challenging HB 2281. The school board voted to lift the restrictions on the books last year.\n\nIn 2012, Huppenthal said in an interview that he was considering eliminating Mexican-American Studies from the state\u2019s higher education system as well. \u201cI think that\u2019s where this toxic thing starts from, the universities,\u201d Huppenthal said at the time.\n\nSince 2010, Hispanics have accounted for a majority of Arizona students from kindergarten to second grade, according to a 2013 report by the Arizona Minority Education Policy Analysis Center.", "article_metadata": {"description": "One of the leaders behind legislation banning a Mexican-American Studies curriculum from the state\u2019s classrooms won\u2019t be in charge of the Arizona school ...", "sailthru.expire_date": "2014-08-28 09:50:25 -0400", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "One of the leaders behind legislation banning a Mexican-American Studies curriculum from the state\u2019s classrooms won\u2019t be in charge of the Arizona school ...", "title": "Man Behind Mexican-American Studies Ban Won't Head Arizona Schools Anymore", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/27/john-huppenthal-loses_n_5721762.html", "image": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1993968/images/o-JOHN-HUPPENTHAL-facebook.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "One of the leaders behind legislation banning a Mexican-American Studies curriculum from the state\u2019s classrooms won\u2019t be in charge of the Arizona school ...", "title": "Man Behind Mexican-American Studies Ban Won't Head Arizona Schools Anymore", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1993968/images/o-JOHN-HUPPENTHAL-facebook.jpg", "height": 1000}, "creator": "RoqPlanas", "site": "@LatinoVoices", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-08-27 09:50:25 -0400", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=5721762", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "latino-voices", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "Arizona Superintendent,Diane Douglas,hispanic heritage,John Huppenthal Superintendent of Schools,John Hupperthal Superintendent,Mexican-American Studies,john huppenthal,John Huppenthal Loss,John Huppenthal Loses", "article": {"section": "Latino Voices", "tag": "Arizona Superintendent,Diane Douglas,hispanic heritage,John Huppenthal Superintendent of Schools,John Hupperthal Superintendent,Mexican-American Studies,john huppenthal,John Huppenthal Loss,John Huppenthal Loses", "published_time": "2014-08-27 09:50:25 -0400", "modified_time": "2014-08-29 00:59:05 -0400"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd024b\"", "article_summary": "ASSOCIATED PRESSOne of the leaders behind legislation banning a Mexican-American Studies curriculum from the state\u2019s classrooms won\u2019t be in charge of the Arizona school system anymore.\nIn 2012, Huppenthal said in an interview that he was considering eliminating Mexican-American Studies from the state\u2019s higher education system as well.\nElected to head the Arizona public school system in 2010, Huppenthal commissioned an independent audit of the courses upon taking office.\nSince 2010, Hispanics have accounted for a majority of Arizona students from kindergarten to second grade, according to a 2013 report by the Arizona Minority Education Policy Analysis Center.\nHuppenthal leaves a Jan Brewer-esque legacy for Latino students who make up a majority of many of the state\u2019s school districts."}
