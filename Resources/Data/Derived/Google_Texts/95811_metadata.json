When only 16% have private health insurance and the 84% who do not are forced to turn to a public sector overstretched and understaffed?\n\nThe problems are manifold, the solutions never easy, but South Africa is on the brink of overhauling its health care system \u2014 and it\u2019s a plan 70 years in the making.\n\nUniversal health coverage in on the horizon, and would bring free at the point of delivery health care to a country blighted by the unequal provision of services.\n\nDismissed by certain parties as a pipe dream and looked upon with suspicion by others, the plan has been fraught with difficulties.\n\nBut with the imminent release of a government white paper outlining a new National Health Insurance (NHI) scheme, there is new hope for millions that they will now be able to access far greater primary health care.\n\nLearning from Obamacare\n\nHealth care is a $29 billion dollar industry in South Africa, accounting for 8.5% of the country\u2019s GDP \u2014 a figure expected to rise. But for many medical professionals and politicians within the country, the disparity between the services available is problematic.\n\n\u201cThe distribution of money between the private and public sectors is very similar to the U.S.,\u201d says Professor Diane McIntyre, founding director of the Health Economics Unit at the University of Cape Town. \u201cUtterly unaffordable\u201d is the way she describes the private sectors of both countries.\n\nIn South Africa, private medical schemes offer first class facilities and quality of care, whilst public hospitals, though offering free child and antenatal care, are understaffed and underfunded. More than half of general practitioners engage in private work, says McIntyre. For specialists, the figure is closer to 70%.\n\nLike the U.S., \u201cit\u2019s very much two systems running in parallel,\u201d says Daygan Eagar, program manager at the Rural Health Advocacy Project. He warns that \u201cwe don\u2019t want to go where the U.S. is going.\u201d\n\nPolicies such as President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act \u201cdon\u2019t undo the \u2018for profit\u2019 elements that make health care so expensive and access so difficult for people.\u201d\n\nInstead, South Africa is going down a different route \u2014 one entirely of its own making.\n\nFalse starts and missed opportunities\n\nUniversal health coverage has long been an aspiration for South Africa.\n\nDreamt up by politicians in the 1940s, scuppered by apartheid and failing to fly in the Mandela years, it has a long narrative of false starts and squandered chances.\n\nIn 1945 the Gluckman Report proposed a version of a nationalized health service, one that Eagar argues \u201cinformed\u201d the creation of Britain\u2019s NHS in 1948.\n\nHowever the rise of the National Party \u2014 and with it apartheid \u2014 precluded its full implementation, and progressive initiatives were almost immediately rolled back, with health care services segregated along racial lines.\n\nWhen Nelson Mandela became president in 1994 \u201cwe missed an opportunity,\u201d says Eagar. Health was at the forefront of ANC policies in the lead up to the election, but despite strong social cohesion and the desire for progressive policies, universal health care failed to materialize.\n\nThen in 2011 the emergence of a government green paper sparked the debate back in to life.\n\nThe green paper, a preliminary government report intended to provoke discussion, outlined a National Health Insurance Fund (\u201ca misnomer\u201d according to McIntyre \u2014 \u201cit\u2019s more like a tax\u201d), opened up the possibility of financing a complete overhaul of the health system.\n\nMore radical that Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act \u2014 which has \u201cdone amazing things in that context,\u201d McIntyre notes \u2014 the paper proposed a means of providing universal health care, drastically improving the primary care available at public health facilities.\n\nIt\u2019s transition to a white paper \u2014 a more formal, government written report and the next step towards becoming legislation \u2014 seemed inevitable, the demand immediate, but instead it remains in a long and painful gestation period of over four years.\n\nNow, it could finally be about to emerge.\n\nA health service for everyone\n\nMcIntyre, despite her role as part of the Ministerial Advisory Committee, is unsure as to the exact publication date of the document, but speculates it could be \u201cwithin the next couple of months.\u201d\n\nThe release has been imminent for some time according to the Department of Health, but recent reports from a briefing of parliament\u2019s Committee on Health suggest it has been finalized and the cabinet process underway.\n\nAt the same briefing, held August 21, Minister of Health Aaron Motsoaledi outlined plans to extend 10 NHI pilot districts in the 2015/16 financial year, using grants \u201cto encourage doctors from the private sector to work in public clinics.\u201d\n\nAccording to most parties, the proposal has fought against a particularly strong current, mainly created by the global economic downturn.\n\nDespite strong political support, financing the project remains an ongoing concern in the roll out of the NHI scheme. This manifests itself in cautiously optimistic statements from government bodies.\n\nAccording to the Western Cape Department of Health, \u201cany proposals that are affordable and make for more efficient and effective use of resources must be welcomed, but have to be contextualized within its broader implications for the health system.\u201d\n\nThe underlying message is clear: with an estimated cost of $18.3 billion to implement, the public health care system cannot afford the NHI scheme to fail.\n\nMoreover, there\u2019s a sense of frustration from provincial departments, kept in the dark regarding decision making within the national Department of Health.\n\nIn a statement to CNN, Western Cape authorities \u201clook forward to\u201d clarification of \u201cthe role of provinces and districts within the NHI to enable the Department to better respond to this policy position.\u201d\n\nConflict of ideology\n\nConfusion and hearsay aside, there are factors the white paper is powerless to combat.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a perception that the NHI would be giving people a free ride,\u201d says Eagar, compounding the view held by a portion of the affluent community that \u201ca small percentage of the population working and paying tax is supporting the rest of the population.\u201d\n\nThere needs to be an ideological shift, he argues. \u201cPeople aren\u2019t willing to jump in and accept that universal health care is an important basic right that must be realized\u2026 it\u2019s absolutely vital if this country is to move forward.\u201d\n\nMcIntyre believes certain elements of the preliminary proposal will be watered down before they make it into policy, and thinks private sector lobbying may be involved.\n\nNot that private medical bodies should be entirely opposed to the move. There are substantial contracts to be won, she argues, and businesses can \u201cabsolutely\u201d profit from the NHI fund.\n\nDespite all sides registering caveats to their arguments, there is genuine belief that once the document is released, universal health coverage could soon take flight.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s political will,\u201d McIntyre says, \u201cit can be done.\u201d\n\nBy Thomas Page", "article_metadata": {"description": "What do you do when over half of health sector spending is available to less than a fifth of the population?
