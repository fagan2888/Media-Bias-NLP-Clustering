Cook County is also the biggest jail in the U.S., housing some 9,000 prisoners on a daily basis.\n\nNow, a clinical psychologist, Nneka Jones Tapia, will be taking over the jail as executive director. She\u2019ll head the jail with a fresh perspective on mental health \u2014 a sorely needed viewpoint in a country that often sweeps mental illness under the rug, and behind bars.\n\nDeinstitutionalization, which began in 1955, involved moving mentally ill patients out of big state institutions back into their communities, which often didn\u2019t offer proper mental health services for them. As a result, thousands of mentally ill people wound up homeless or in jail \u2014 frequently imprisoned for minor, petty offenses, or on their own accord because they had nowhere else to go.\n\nCook County Jail is a standing symbol of the deinstitutionalization-induced mental illness crisis in America. But the appointment of Tapia offers hope to those who aim to change the system.\n\n\u201cConservative numbers are 25, but we think it\u2019s closer to 30 or 35 percent of our jail population that has a mental illness,\u201d Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart told ThinkProgress, \u201cso we\u2019ve effectively become the largest mental health hospital in the country. I don\u2019t know anybody who could say that someone suffering from serious mental illness should be put in a tiny, confined area that is populated by another individual who has a mental illness \u2014 who you don\u2019t know and may or may not have some issues with violence as well \u2014 be medicated and treated as if you were a criminal.\u201d\n\nIn recent decades, not only have psychiatric patients been shuffled into jails, but public health funding for mental illness has been slashed significantly. In the U.S., the topic of mental health swirls through the media briefly after a mass shooting, then disappears again. And a stigma remains \u2014 people who are mentally ill aren\u2019t taken as seriously as they should be, and the country\u2019s mental health services are lacking.\n\nThis is especially true in the U.S. prison system. A New York Times investigative report released earlier this year found that despite the city\u2019s recent attempts to reform New York City jails, mentally ill inmates were still beaten, mistreated, and thrown into solitary confinement cells, all of which worsened their condition and contributed to the vicious cycle.\n\nIn an interview with NPR, Tapia notes that the numbers of mentally ill in jails are growing because of \u201ca lack of services in the community, particularly psychiatric services,\u201d she said. \u201cThe city of Chicago is starting to work with us, but, you know, their history of closing the six mental health clinics has done us a disservice, and the number of hospitals that are willing to take people with mental illnesses is dwindling.\u201d\n\n'Severe Mental Illness'\n\nToday, thanks to Obamacare\u2019s Mental Health Parity Act, most mental health services are covered under insurance. But on all other levels, the country is lagging behind.\n\nTapia hopes that her appointment as head of Cook County Jail will send a message to the rest of the country, which has repeatedly neglected and shut down mental health care to the detriment of thousands of people.\n\n\u201c[I]t sends a powerful message,\u201d Tapia told NPR. \u201cYou know, law enforcement was never meant to handle mental illness \u2014 severe mental illness. But our staff do a tremendous job and I can only continue to support them in that. So undoubtedly, the sheriff thought of that when he considered me for this role.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "largest jail, mental health, mental illness", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Cook County Jail in Chicago has just appointed a clinical psychologist to run the prison, in the hopes of dismantling the stigma and mistreatment of mentally ill inmates.", "title": "A Mental Health Revolution Is Brewing \u2014 At The Nation's Largest Jail", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/clinical-psychologist-head-countrys-largest-jail-what-it-means-mental-health-us-334572", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/05/21/prison.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Cook County Jail in Chicago has just appointed a clinical psychologist to run the prison, in the hopes of dismantling the stigma and mistreatment of mentally ill inmates.", "title": "A Mental Health Revolution Is Brewing \u2014 At The Nation's Largest Jail", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/clinical-psychologist-head-countrys-largest-jail-what-it-means-mental-health-us-334572", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/05/21/prison.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/05/21/prison.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Hill", "published_time": "2015-05-21T17:45:19-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-21T17:45:18-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Cook County Jail in Chicago has just appointed a clinical psychologist to run the prison, in the hopes of dismantling the stigma and mistreatment of mentally ill inmates."}, "article_summary": "\u201cYou know, law enforcement was never meant to handle mental illness \u2014 severe mental illness.\nOne-third of the inmates at Cook County Jail in Chicago are mentally ill, branding it as one of the largest psychiatric facilities in the country.\nSince deinstitutionalization, the nation's jails have largely grown into mental illness hospitals \u2014 except unlike the latter, they don't provide proper care.\nCook County Jail is a standing symbol of the deinstitutionalization-induced mental illness crisis in America.\nIn the U.S., the topic of mental health swirls through the media briefly after a mass shooting, then disappears again."}
