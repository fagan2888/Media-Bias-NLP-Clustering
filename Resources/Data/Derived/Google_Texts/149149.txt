Hairstylist Judy Madone is ready to help men, women and children of Fremont County freshen up their look with a new spring makeover.

Madone, owner and operator of On the Cutting Edge Salon at 116 S. Fifth St., took some time off for medical reasons the last several months, but she's back and ready to cut, trim, highlight and curl. She is happy to continue serving her current customers, and welcomes former and potential clients, as well.

"It makes me feel good when I can make someone else look pretty and feel good about themselves," she said.

Madone opened her shop in December 2010. She has more than 30 years experience in her field and has taken several courses in specialized cutting techniques, including razor cuts and barber cuts. She also specializes in spiral perms and highlights. Standard haircuts are $15, cuts for longer hair are $18-$20, and men's barber cuts are $10.
