The wife of Miami Dolphins quarterback Ryan Tannehill returned a rental car in South Florida with her AR-15 rifle in the back seat, police said.

Lauren Tannehill had rented the white Nissan Rogue on Jan. 4 and returned it to E-Z Rent-A-Car at the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, the Sun Sentinel reported.

Hours later, the car was rented to Judith Fleissig of New York, who discovered the $2,000 weapon a couple days later.

“We got out of the car, we were kind of freaked out,” she told the newspaper. “I didn’t want to touch it. I took a picture, zipped it back up and went to the police station. They came out and took it.”

Miss Fleissig turned the rifle in to the Hillsboro Beach Police Department. A sheriff’s report said Mrs. Tannehill was instructed to contact the office about getting the rifle back, but it is not clear if she has yet done so, The Sentinel reported.

“Though dangerous if it would have landed in the wrong hands, it’s not criminal,” Broward County Sheriff’s spokeswoman Keyla Concepción said of Mrs. Tannehill.
