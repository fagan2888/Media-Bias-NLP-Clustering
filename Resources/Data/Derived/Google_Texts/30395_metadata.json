Emanuel about his provocative prediction that most employers will abandon health coverage by 2025 struck a nerve with You\u2019re The Boss readers.\n\nIt came as no surprise that Dr. Emanuel\u2019s claim, first made in his new book, \u201cReinventing American Health Care,\u201d would be swept up in the broader political and ideological debate about the Affordable Care Act. But in their many comments, readers raised interesting questions, and we took some of them back to Dr. Emanuel in another conversation that appears, edited and condensed, below.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that among those readers who identified themselves as small-business owners, there was little disagreement: Most expressed a strong desire to get out of the health insurance business. \u201cI have provided health insurance for 30 years and am dropping it in 60 days,\u201d wrote J of New York. To his employees, he continued, health care costs are an abstraction, \u201cand my contributions to it are not clearly recognized. Now they will be.\u201d\n\nQ.\n\nYour prediction provoked a good bit of anger directed both at employers and the Affordable Care Act. But it seems to me that the argument you\u2019re making is that if this happens, it\u2019s going to be because employees aren\u2019t looking to employers to offer insurance.\n\nA.\n\nRight. It\u2019s not because of anything in the law. It\u2019s about the dynamic between employers and employees. Employers react to the market. Actually, after the interview appeared a colleague of mine wrote me and said, \u201cYou know, my sister would love to be able to go into the exchange, because she can get a better deal for herself, but her employer\u2019s not going that direction, at least not now.\u201d\n\nQ.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of skepticism that the policies on the exchanges are as good as the policies that are available to groups, particularly to large groups.\n\n\n\nA.\n\nYeah. The predicate, the assumption, behind my claim is that the exchanges are going to get better, that they\u2019re going to be desirable shopping places, the options are going to be highly desirable, there\u2019s going to be more choice for people. If the products available on the exchange are not equivalent to what responsible large private employers are doing, they\u2019re not going to send their workers there. It\u2019s just that simple.\n\nQ.\n\nWhat has to happen for exchange plans to be able to compete with group plans?\n\nA.\n\nI do think the exchanges can offer better products. The exchange is not just the website \u2013 it includes things like product development, working with the insurance company to get better product out there. But insurers aren\u2019t going to develop these plans unless they perceive there\u2019s a market there for them. And they\u2019re not going to perceive there\u2019s a market unless they can be sure that it\u2019s a nice shopping experience and that people really want those products on the exchange. So I think this is a chicken-and-egg problem.\n\nQ.\n\nDo 7.1 million enrollees help?\n\nA.\n\nYeah. Especially since it was so unexpected. It says there\u2019s this huge pent-up demand out there for affordable health insurance. Despite not having two months at the start, getting it screwed up, people predicting the demise of health care reform, Americans signed up in droves.\n\nQ.\n\nOne reader came back to us with a hypothetical: a $4,000 insurance benefit that an employer converts to a cash raise \u2014 but when you account for the taxes for the employee and the penalty for not offering insurance, that $4,000 now costs the company $7,800. What do you say to that math?\n\nA.\n\nYeah, I think he\u2019s got another good point against me, and Mark Pauly, my colleague, has pointed out that there\u2019s a lot of value in employers providing the insurance, in just this way, that it\u2019s going to be hard to replace.\n\nQ.\n\nOn top of that, a lot of people are skeptical that employers who drop coverage will actually compensate their employees with a raise.\n\nA.\n\nYeah, I know, the American public is extremely skeptical of that. But every economic analysis that\u2019s been done of health insurance with employers and wages shows that it is replaced almost dollar for dollar. It\u2019s not replaced on Day One necessarily, but over a very short period of time, a few years, people get the money, in terms of higher wages. And similarly, one should say that when employers give you a richer health insurance package, that usually corresponds over time to a slower increase in wages.\n\nQ.\n\nDo you worry that this could become a mechanism for employers to offload the rising cost of health insurance?\n\nA.\n\nYes, exactly, I worry about that. From what I can tell \u2014 and here I\u2019m getting out of my comfort zone \u2014 what employers are worried about more than the actual increase (although they keep claiming it\u2019s the increase) is the unpredictability. Organizing their planning is harder when the costs each year are so unpredictable.\n\nQ.\n\nThe other day, Robert Gibbs, a former Obama administration adviser, told an audience that the employer mandate would never be implemented \u2014 it would be killed off. What do you think of that?\n\nA.\n\nNo way. He\u2019s wrong. Period.\n\nQ.\n\nIf employers drop health insurance and send people to the exchanges, do you see that in any way as a step toward a single-payer system?\n\nA.\n\nNo! There are some Americans that want single-payer. All I can say is the majority don\u2019t. Americans aren\u2019t into the single-payer game. It ain\u2019t happening. We barely got the Affordable Care Act through. We certainly would not have gotten a single-payer proposal through. Every responsible liberal group in 2009, 2010 said, look, the worst option is to do nothing. People understood very clearly that between doing nothing and reforming the system, it was important to reform the system.\n\nQ.\n\nThe last time we spoke, you said that nobody in the administration thought through how the Affordable Care Act might affect businesses. Looking back now, should there have been someone in the White House who was really focused on this from the perspective of business owners?\n\nA.\n\nLook, we talked to a lot of business owners. We talked to lots of consultants who deal with businesses. I think I had like 70-some odd meetings with various groups. I took so many meetings, people thought I was crazy. The fact of the matter is that no one can have perfect clarity as to how things are going to unfold. Just take a simple example: If I had told you three months ago we\u2019re going to pass 7 million people signing up on the exchange, you would have taken that bet, and I would\u2019ve looked like an idiot at that point. That\u2019s just three months ago. I\u2019m making a prediction for 11 years from now, and almost 15 years after the passage of the Affordable Care. O.K.? Let\u2019s be humble, and let\u2019s be a little more reasonable about the accuracy of predictions.\n\nQ.\n\nHow big a problem will it be if Hobby Lobby wins its Supreme Court case, and employers are able to carve out exemptions from the health law based on religious views?\n\nA.\n\nI think this opens a huge can of worms as to what anyone\u2019s religion is or what the religious dictates are, and how those connect with health services. There are lots of religions that don\u2019t believe in circumcision \u2014 we\u2019re not paying for circumcision. Or, we don\u2019t believe in premarital sex, so we\u2019re not going to cover the cervical cancer treatment, because the only way you get it is through premarital sex. My religion doesn\u2019t like smoking \u2013 all right, we\u2019re not paying for emphysema care or lung cancer care.
