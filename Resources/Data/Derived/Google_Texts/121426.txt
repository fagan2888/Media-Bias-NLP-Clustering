By Liisa Rajala

The New Hampshire Charitable Foundation recently awarded $2,381,317 million to 148 nonprofit organizations, through its community grants program, which pools funds from donors.

Nonprofits applied for funds through a competitive application process, said Charitable Foundation spokesperson Kristen Oliveri.

The foundation hands out about $30 million a year in grants and scholarships.

Almost a quarter of the $2.3 million went to the Seacoast Region - $550,878 to 28 organizations, including two over the border in Maine.

While some grants were in the low few thousands, several organizations across the state received $20,000 to $25,000, including the Loon Preservation Committee of Moultonborough (to recover the loon population), the New Hampshire Alliance for Immigrants and Refugees of Manchester (to strengthen efforts to welcome immigrants and refugees to their neighborhoods) and the Peterborough Players, a summer theater (for general operating support).

The largest grant allocation went to the Community Child Care Center of Portsmouth, receiving $60,000 for general operating support, followed by the University of New Hampshire in Durham, which received $50,000 to increase the capacity of organizations and volunteers that care for New Hampshire’s lands and waters.

One interesting initiative: the Cheshire County Conservation District of Walpole received $45,000 over the next three years to strengthen the connections between chefs and farms to grow a vibrant local food economy in the Monadnock region.

$100,000 of the funds were evenly distributed to four out-of-state organizations supporting statewide efforts in New Hampshire: Alzheimer’s Association MA/NH Chapter of Watertown, Mass., Center for Collaborative Education of Boston, Mass., National Wildlife Federation-Northeast Regional Center of Montpelier, Vt., and Planned Parenthood of Northern New England of Burlington, Vt.
