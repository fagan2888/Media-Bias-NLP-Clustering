Keynesian macro, in particular, is often regarded with intense distaste, and a lot of economists would like to ban it from the field.\n\nQuiggin points out, rightly, that almost all microeconomics depends crucially on the assumption that the economy is at full employment; this assumption is false, but what makes it not too false in normal times is the existence of stabilization policies, monetary and fiscal, that usually produce fairly quick recoveries from slumps. Macro is what makes micro work, to the extent that it does.\n\nI would add that macro is the only reason anyone listens to all those microeconomists who think they\u2019re being rigorous. To see why, we need to think about the history of thought.\n\nIf you go back to the state of American economics in the 1930s and even into the 1940s, it was not at all the model-oriented, mathematical field it later became. Institutional economics was still a powerful force, and many senior economists disliked mathematical modeling. When Paul Samuelson published Foundations of Economic Analysis in 1947, the chairman of Harvard\u2019s economics department tried to limit the print run to 500, grudgingly accepted a run of 750, and ordered the mathematical type broken up immediately.\n\nSo why did model-oriented, math-heavy economics triumph? It wasn\u2019t because general-equilibrium models of perfect competition had overwhelming empirical success. What happened, I\u2019d argue, was Keynesian macroeconomics.\n\nThink about it: In the 1930s you had a catastrophe, and if you were a public official or even just a layman looking for guidance and understanding, what did you get from institutionalists? Caricaturing, but only slightly, you got long, elliptical explanations that it all had deep historical roots and clearly there was no quick fix. Meanwhile, along came the Keynesians, who were model-oriented, and who basically said \u201cPush this button\u201d\u2013 increase G, and all will be well. And the experience of the wartime boom seemed to demonstrate that demand-side expansion did indeed work the way the Keynesians said it did.\n\nIt\u2019s not an accident that Samuelson, even as he was raising the math level of microeconomics, was a key figure in the triumph of Keynesian economics. Nor was it at all an accident that his intro textbook, in its 1948 edition and for a long time thereafter, started with macro, and only got to micro later. The perceived success of macroeconomics did double duty, establishing the bona fides of a model-oriented approach and also suggesting that full employment was not too bad an assumption \u2014 given the right monetary and fiscal policies.\n\nOh, and economists who are upset that the public seems to judge the profession by its success at macro diagnosis and prediction are missing the point: it has always been thus, and purists who disdain macro are making mock of the only reason anyone takes them at all seriously.\n\nThe academic enterprise of economics as we know it, in other words, rests on a macro foundation, and in fact a Keynesian foundation \u2014 and economists who denounce all of that as witchcraft are busily sawing off the branch they\u2019re sitting on.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20131026094339, "BN": "krugman", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/krugman", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/krugman/post", "DISPLAYDATE": "October 26, 2013", "keywords": "Uncategorized", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/krugman/Macrofoundations (Wonkish) ( 20131026 )", "PT": "Blogs", "SCG": "krugman", "sourceApp": "blogs", "twitter": {"description": "Keynes made economics what it is.", "title": "Macrofoundations (Wonkish)", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/26/macrofoundations-wonkish/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "site": "@NytimesKrugman", "card": "summary"}, "blogpostid": 100000002519352, "description": "Keynes made economics what it is.", "CG": "Opinion", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "October 26, 2013", "article": {"published_time": 1382795019, "author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/paulkrugman/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Uncategorized", "modified_time": "2013-10-26T13:43:39-04:00"}, "utime": 20131026134339, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20131026, "pdate": 20131026, "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "Paul Krugman Blog", "description": "Keynes made economics what it is.", "title": "Macrofoundations (Wonkish)", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/26/macrofoundations-wonkish/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/26/macrofoundations-wonkish/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "Macrofoundations (Wonkish)", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf672\"", "article_summary": "Keynesian macro, in particular, is often regarded with intense distaste, and a lot of economists would like to ban it from the field.\nIt\u2019s not an accident that Samuelson, even as he was raising the math level of microeconomics, was a key figure in the triumph of Keynesian economics.\nIf you go back to the state of American economics in the 1930s and even into the 1940s, it was not at all the model-oriented, mathematical field it later became.\nI would add that macro is the only reason anyone listens to all those microeconomists who think they\u2019re being rigorous.\nInstitutional economics was still a powerful force, and many senior economists disliked mathematical modeling."}
