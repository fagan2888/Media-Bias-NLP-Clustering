But he was frustrated with the way the law was written, explaining that it is hard for him to determine his yearly income because he is a self-employed contractor. He was also upset that the Supreme Court allowed states to opt out of taking part in the mandate, leaving millions of Americans without the ability to sign up.\n\n\u201cI put the blame on everyone \u2014 Republican and Democrat,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I do mainly blame Republicans for their pigheadedness. They\u2019re blocking policies that could help everyone. I\u2019m in the situation I\u2019m in because they chose not to expand Medicaid for political reasons. And I know I\u2019m not the only one.\u201d\n\nLang said that he has read every comment posted on his fundraiser, which drew several donors who identified themselves as progressives. Some of the donors included comments telling him to \u201cturn off Fox News\u201d while wishing him well.\n\n\u201cThis whole thing has helped me see more clearly,\u201d he said. \u201cLike they say, hindsight is 20/20.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Luis-Lang-GoFundMe-800x430.png", "height": 430}, "title": "Anti-Obamacare Republican renounces \u2018pigheaded\u2019 GOP \u2014 and he wants you to know why"}, "fb": {"app_id": 212555972273585}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.1, maximum-scale=10.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1b38\"", "article_summary": "He told Think Progress that contrary to previous reports, he never totally opposed the law, commonly known as Obamacare.\n'\u201d Luis Lang said, adding that he wants to rip his voting registration card up on national television to confirm his change of political affiliation.\n\u201cNow that I\u2019m looking at what each party represents, my wife and I are both saying, \u2018Hey, we\u2019re not Republicans!\nLuis Lang (GoFundMe)The 49-year-old South Carolina man who garnered attention \u2014 and thousands of dollars in donations \u2014 after revealing his medical issues online is now supporting the Affordable Care Act and turning away from the GOP, Think Progress reported.\nI\u2019m in the situation I\u2019m in because they chose not to expand Medicaid for political reasons."}
