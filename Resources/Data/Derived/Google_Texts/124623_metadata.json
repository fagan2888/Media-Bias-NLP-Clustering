It's a special day and sixth graders like these know it.\n\nKayli Cwach: Martin Luther King, Jr. Day.\n\nMatt Holsen: What did you learn today in class about him?\n\nCwach: That he had an 'I Have A Dream' speech that talks about people that can't be judged by the color of their skin but how they actually are.\n\nSeveral classrooms at McGovern focused on Martin Luther King, Jr.\n\nFrom his iconic speech to life of non-violent activism, King's story is still relevant and some would say his message is still needed.\n\n\"I think it's good because people shouldn't be hating on other people just for the color of their skin and where they come from,\" Ramiro Ordonez said.\n\nOrdonez tries to show his character by getting good grades. He says in a school full of people of different backgrounds, he also tries to treat others the right way.\n\n\"Yeah, because people need to come together because this is a free country. That's why the people came to this country, for freedom,\" Ordonez said.\n\nSome of the students reading King's famous speech in this story are part of the school's immersion program and have been in the country less than two years.\n\nEducation\n\nMiddle School {{Title}} Remove Change News General Courts Web Only Crime Outdoors Events Center Non-Homepage Boredom Busters Pipeline Positively KELOLAND Technology Hunger Affordable Care Act Shops Flooding Remembering 9/11 Drought JazzFest Spring Storm Honor Flight Spencer Anniversary\n\nDoApp Health News Business News Sports\n\nAgriculture Markets Livestock Crops Politics\n\nHealthBeat Cancer Children's Health Heart Health Wellness & Nutrition General Health Beat Women's Health RX Resources What's Going Around OTC Diabetes Recalls Dental Health Men's Health\n\nPolitics South Dakota Legislature Budget Congress Taxes General Local Campaign President US Senate New Laws US House Iowa Ballot Issues Local Races Minnesota Gubernatorial\n\nEducation Funding College Elementary High School Pre K School Supplies Middle School\n\nSports Professional College High School Sports Zone Headlines Summit League Tournament Olympics\n\nBusiness Industry Your Money Matters Development Gas & Energy Legislation Economy/Stocks Employment General Health Care Technology Education Funding Tourism Banking/Finance Housing Transportation Insurance Meetings & Events Retail & Restaurants All Industries On The Move Shops Agriculture\n\nFeatured Stories Eye on KELOLAND Inside KELOLAND\n\nWeather Snow Forecast Records Rain Flooding Drought WX Corner General\n\nWorld News\n\nInvestigates GEAR UP\n\nSponsored Done\n\n\u00a9 2016 KELOLAND TV.
