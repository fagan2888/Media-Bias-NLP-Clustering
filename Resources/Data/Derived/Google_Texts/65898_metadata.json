Her daughter went to college in Massachusetts and she needed a plan that would cover her there. The marketplace representative went over her options, assuring her that a $685-a-month Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield plan did exactly what she needed it to do.\n\nAnd when she got her new insurance card, it clearly said \u201cmulti-state\u201d across the top. Obviously it covered her in multiple states.\n\nExcept that it didn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cMulti-state\u201d is a federal designation that means the plan is sold in several states, not that coverage extends across state lines.\n\nWeeks after she bought her new insurance, Leahy-Lind \u2014 the former Maine Center for Disease Control division director who made headlines for publicizing document destruction at the CDC \u2014 found herself fighting two new battles: a pancreatic tumor that threatened her life and her insurance company, which would pay for care in Maine but not a specialist surgeon in Boston.\n\nShe was shocked, then angry.\n\n\u201cI have a master\u2019s degree and multiple postgraduate courses within public health and here I got snookered,\u201d Leahy-Lind said.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act now requires most Americans to have health insurance. In Maine, more people are buying it on their own, without a human resources department to explain benefits or point out potential pitfalls, like the multi-state insurance that isn\u2019t good in multiple states.\n\nPlans are misunderstood. Assumptions turn out to be wrong. Questions go unasked.\n\nAnd even when everything is done right, problems sometimes arise.\n\nHealth insurance is like any other major purchase, experts say \u2014 buyer beware.\n\n\u201cYou just cannot ask enough questions,\u201d Maine Bureau of Insurance Superintendent Eric Cioppa said.\n\nIn Maine, most people receive health insurance through their job or through the government as part of Medicaid or Medicare. Plan choices tend to be limited, which also limits the risk of choosing wrong. And, at least in the case of employer-sponsored health insurance, there\u2019s often a nearby person or a department responsible for shopping for a plan, dealing with questions and handling problems.\n\nBut more people are buying their own health insurance. Between 2013 and 2014, the number of Mainers covered by an individual insurance plan doubled, from about 32,000 to about 64,000.\n\nThose Mainers have a dizzying array of plans and options to chose from, both on and off the federal marketplace (also known as an exchange). And although brokers, agents, insurance representatives, navigators, certified assistants, federal marketplace representatives and others can help, consumers are the ones ultimately responsible for assessing their needs, gauging a plan\u2019s fit, asking the right questions and paying the bill. The pitfalls are many.\n\n\u201cAnd this is an annual event now. I mean, every year they\u2019ve got to do this,\u201d Cioppa said. \u201cSubsidies are based on one plan, which you may or may not have. Networks change. You really can\u2019t be passive anymore.\u201d\n\nMost individual plans for 2014 expire Dec. 31, even if they were bought partway through the year. Open enrollment runs from Nov. 15 to Feb. 15. That is the only time most consumers will be able to buy insurance, both on and off the federal marketplace, unless they lose their job, get married, have a baby or experience another life-changing event.\n\nLeahy-Lind, 56, left her job at the CDC about a year ago. She had alleged that her bosses there ordered her to shred public documents and then harassed and discriminated against her when she refused.\n\nShe has since filed a whistle-blower lawsuit in federal court.\n\nAfter leaving the CDC, Leahy-Lind went to work in real estate. She\u2019d done the job before and knew it could pay the bills, even if it didn\u2019t provide health insurance. She kept her CDC health insurance plan through the decades-old Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, or COBRA. She had to pay the premiums \u2014 $1,250 a month \u2014 but she and her youngest daughter were covered.\n\nThen, this summer, Leahy-Lind got a notice. Although open enrollment had closed, she could still sign up for individual insurance because she was using COBRA. She might be able to save money by buying her own insurance through the marketplace.\n\nAs long as the insurance was decent and her daughter would be covered at college in Massachusetts, she was happy to pay less. She called the toll-free number.\n\n\u201cA federal representative walked me through the whole process. . . . they said this is the same insurance you have now, only you have this multi-state plan and it\u2019s a lot less money,\u201d Leahy-Lind said.\n\nThe representative, she said, was clear: Her new insurance would pay for doctors in other states. In fact, she said, the plan cost a little more for that multi-state option.\n\nStill, Leahy-Lind would be paying just $685 a month, almost half what she was under COBRA. Her deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs were higher than her old plan, so it made sense that her monthly premiums would be less than they were under COBRA.\n\nShe signed up.\n\n\u201cI thought I made a really good decision,\u201d she said.\n\nThat feeling lasted just a few weeks. Her new insurance plan started July 1. At the end of the month, she noticed a lump on her neck. A friend who\u2019d seen Leahy-Lind just the week before startled at her sudden weight loss. She got so suddenly and violently ill one day that she couldn\u2019t make it out of the car before she threw up.\n\nDoctors soon discovered a tumor on her pancreas. It has so far tested benign, but it\u2019s still life-threatening, both because of its location and its type.\n\n\u201cThere are three levels of potential malignancy and mine\u2019s at the highest level,\u201d she said. \u201cSo [the doctor] said we could leave it there and within a year either it\u2019ll block my duct and I would die from complications or it would turn, from their perspective, into malignant, invasive pancreatic cancer.\u201d\n\nLeahy-Lind, who has worked in public health for nearly 20 years, started researching statistics and combing through medical journals. She found a doctor in Boston who specialized in her condition and she made an emergency appointment with him. He and others agreed she needed surgery, now. And the operation would not be easy.\n\nBecause of the tumor\u2019s location at the head of her pancreas, it\u2019s perilously close to invading other organs. The surgery \u2014 called a Whipple procedure \u2014 would have to take 40 percent of her pancreas, a portion of her small intestine and a section of her stomach. Recovery takes several weeks under the best of circumstances, several months when there are complications. If any cancer cells are found afterward, she\u2019ll also have to undergo chemotherapy and radiation.\n\nMassachusetts General Hospital offered a nationally recognized pancreatic center and a surgeon who specialized in Whipple surgery and pancreatic removal. She found statistics that showed her odds of survival were far better with a doctor experienced in the complex operation than with someone who didn\u2019t do it as often.\n\nLeahy-Lind expected her insurance company would approve the surgery without a problem. She had, after all, bought the multi-state plan.\n\nBut \u201cmulti-state\u201d has nothing to do with coverage. It\u2019s a federal designation for plans approved to be sold in several states.\n\n\u201cTo say it could confuse consumers, I think, is an understatement,\u201d Cioppa said. \u201cBecause the \u2018multi-state\u2019 plan we have in Maine is Anthem\u2019s narrow network plan and it does not provide coverage out of state.\u201d\n\nAs a narrow network, Anthem\u2019s plan doesn\u2019t even cover all hospitals within Maine, except in an emergency.\n\nExperts say Anthem didn\u2019t do anything wrong by offering the plan and it\u2019s not responsible for calling it \u201cmulti-state.\u201d But neither did Leahy-Lind do anything wrong when she believed the marketplace representative, they say. The representative was mistaken and apparently gave her the wrong information.\n\nAbout 1,500 Mainers carry Anthem\u2019s multi-state plan, according to the Maine Bureau of Insurance. No one knows how many of them bought the plan believing it would pay for doctors in other states.\n\nExperts aren\u2019t surprised by the confusion caused by multi-state plans that don\u2019t work in multiple states. The name is clearly a problem, they said.\n\nThere are the other pitfalls.\n\nHealth insurance plans automatically renew for 2015 if consumers don\u2019t cancel or sign up for a new plan. That automatic renewal can be good since consumers don\u2019t have to do anything to stay insured.\n\nBut it can also be bad. Consumers may be saddled for a year with insurance that\u2019s gotten more expensive, doesn\u2019t meet their needs or isn\u2019t their best option anymore.\n\n\u201cSome of the plans have changed, your plan might have changed,\u201d said Andrea Irwin, legal and policy director for Consumers for Affordable Health Care, Maine\u2019s designated Consumer Assistance Program. \u201cAnd there\u2019s so much in your life that can change: getting married, moving, having kids. Your health can change. There\u2019s just so many different ways that your life may change in the course of these last six to eight months.\u201d\n\nSome plans pay for all hospitals in Maine while others, like Anthem, offer a narrow network that excludes some hospitals. Consumers can be in for a big surprise \u2014 in the form of a big bill \u2014 if they go to a hospital they assume is in-network and it\u2019s not an emergency.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thinking of one person we heard from, a man whose wife had given birth,\u201d Irwin said. \u201cThey had an Anthem plan and she had given birth at Mercy (Hospital in Portland) and was told it wouldn\u2019t be covered.\u201d\n\nSome plans pay for all hospitals, but not all doctors. That\u2019s meant some patients have surgery at an in-network hospital only to find out that their anesthesiologist, for example, wasn\u2019t on the insurance company\u2019s list of approved doctors.\n\nCioppa called that an \u201cunreasonable expectation\u201d on consumers, but he\u2019s seen insurance companies refuse to pay for the doctor\u2019s services when that happens.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve gone to bat in several circumstances,\u201d he said.\n\nJust as they have in-network and out-of-network doctors and hospitals, insurance plans have prescription drugs they will and won\u2019t cover. And then there are drugs they\u2019ll pay something toward, leaving consumers to pay the rest. Consumers have to peruse that drug list \u2014 called a formulary \u2014 to find out which medications are covered, but that list can be over 100 pages long.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s gotten a lot more complicated,\u201d Cioppa said.\n\nAlso complicated: paying for insurance.\n\nAlthough consumers can opt to pay their monthly premiums with an automatic withdrawal from their bank account, experts say it doesn\u2019t start the first month. The initial premium payment \u2014 the one that locks in the insurance \u2014 must be paid first, then automatic withdrawal can take over. It\u2019s a detail that\u2019s caused problems for some Mainers.\n\nThere is a 30- to 90-day grace period on most late health insurance payments, but not the first one. No initial payment means no insurance; the plan is immediately cancelled.\n\nAnd while those consumers won\u2019t have insurance, they will have something else: a fine. By law, most Americans without insurance currently face a penalty of up to $285 per family or 1 percent of household income, whichever is greater.\n\nFor those who need help paying for insurance, subsidies are available. But those have caused confusion, too.\n\nFederal subsidies are available for people who earn between 100 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty level. Special credits are also available to lower out-of-pocket insurance expenses \u2014 such as co-pays at the doctor\u2019s office \u2014 for people who earn between 100 percent and 250 percent of the federal poverty level.\n\nThose special credits have caught some Mainers off guard.\n\nAt Maine Community Health Options, a health insurance co-op in Lewiston, some consumers signed up for plans with a higher monthly cost because those plans had lower co-pays. But they didn\u2019t realize they qualified for special credits, which lowered co-pays for them. They didn\u2019t need to pay more every month to pay less when they visit the doctor\u2019s office.\n\nThe insurance company caught some sign-ups in time to urge the consumers to change plans, but a few people paid extra every month for nothing.\n\n\u201cThe difference [between plans] is very, very subtle,\u201d said Michael Gendreau, director of outreach, education and communications.\n\nWhat to do\n\nSo how can Mainers avoid the pitfalls?\n\nFirst, experts say, don\u2019t automatically re-enroll. Consumers should look at what they need for health care, what they have now for insurance, and what plans are available to them starting Nov. 15.\n\nThose who got caught in the multi-state confusion might want to switch to a plan that covers them out of state, for example. Those who liked only certain doctors and hospitals might find what they need in a narrow network.\n\n\u201cIt pays for them, even if they\u2019re very, very happy with what they have, it pays for them to go and take a look at everything,\u201d said Janice Daku, Navigator Consortium Project director at Western Maine Community Action, one of two Maine groups that received federal money to help Mainers sign up for health insurance.\n\nEven though a plan may look the same for 2015, there can be slight but important changes, including which medications are covered, how much patients must pay when they see the doctor and which hospitals are favored.\n\n\u201cOur message to consumers: Look at the plan you currently have, make sure you understand your benefits, costs and provider network coverage, and then compare what you have to the other plans,\u201d said Anthem spokesman Rory Sheehan.\n\nAfter that, experts say, consumers should ask questions. Lots and lots of questions. And never assume, even if the answer seems obvious.\n\nAlthough brokers, agents, insurance company representatives, navigators, certified assistants and federal marketplace representatives are all trained to answer questions, individuals can have old information or be misinformed. Experts say consumers should consider talking to more than one trusted person and double check important plan details \u2014 such as which hospitals are covered and whether the plan pays for doctors outside Maine \u2014 directly with the insurance company.\n\nExperts also advise Mainers to read the fine print in any plan they\u2019re considering. Though that\u2019s not always so easy.\n\n\u201cOld-school people like me, where you\u2019re used to having hard copies of things and benefit packages that you keep in your little manila envelope in a safe place, they don\u2019t have that anymore,\u201d Leahy-Lind said. \u201cThey just send you these [website] links.\u201d\n\nExperts say Mainers should ask for three things when looking at a plan: the certificate of coverage (fine print), summary of benefits and coverage (lists what the plan covers and out-of-pocket costs) and the prescription drug formulary (tells which medications will be covered). The Maine Bureau of Insurance expects insurance companies to provide paper copies of those upon request.\n\n\u201cIf anyone ever has trouble getting that, they can call us or the Bureau of Insurance,\u201d said Irwin at Consumers for Affordable Health Care. \u201cOr if anyone has trouble understanding it, we would also help them do that. I know sometimes it\u2019s not written in consumer-friendly language.\u201d\n\nOnce consumers have the information, experts say, they should take time to think about their options. They shouldn\u2019t feel rushed, even if they\u2019ve been on the phone with a marketplace representative for an hour or spent the afternoon going through the sign-up process with a navigator.\n\n\u201cVery rarely does anyone say, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s the plan I want right there\u2019 while they\u2019re there for their appointment. They need to process and think about it, and we encourage that. Think about your own medical needs, what drugs you take on a regular basis, what your chronic health conditions might be. For anyone else that you\u2019re going to have covered in the plan, think about their circumstances and their health,\u201d said Daku. \u201cTake your time.\u201d\n\nBut sometimes consumers can do everything right and still run into problems. When that happens, Consumers for Affordable Health Care and the Maine Bureau of Insurance take complaints and work to resolve issues, including denied claims and surprise out-of-network medical bills.\n\nConsumers also have the right to appeal decisions made by their insurance company.\n\nGenerally, consumers can appeal twice to their insurance company. If both are denied, they can ask the Maine Bureau of Insurance to pursue an external review before an independent review organization. For designated \u201cmulti-state\u201dplans, U.S. Office of Personnel Management oversees the external review, not the Maine Bureau of Insurance.\n\nConsumers can also take their case to court.\n\nMainers can get help with appeals from Consumers for Affordable Health Care. Since 2011, it has has recovered $300,000 for Mainers whose health insurance claims had been denied. Most of it was recovered on appeal.\n\nLeahy-Lind is appealing her insurance company\u2019s decision on the grounds that its network of doctors and hospitals isn\u2019t adequate for her condition. She said Anthem will pay for her to have surgery in Portland, but not in Boston where her specialist practices.\n\nIn the meantime, she has has committed to having the surgery in Boston at the beginning of October. It will likely cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, money she can\u2019t afford. Then there will be another surgery to remove the tumor in her neck that turned out to be unrelated to her pancreas. And after that, a lifetime of tests and scans to watch for recurrence.\n\nShe calls herself \u201cextremely lucky\u201d that her tumor was caught earlier than most. She feels less lucky with her insurance plan.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to know what you have before you buy it. Question everything,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think the people who sold it to me even knew what it meant.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "PORTLAND, Maine \u2014 Sharon Leahy-Lind was certain her new health insurance plan would pay for doctors outside Maine.After all, she specifically asked about that when she called the federal marketplace to buy new health insurance.
