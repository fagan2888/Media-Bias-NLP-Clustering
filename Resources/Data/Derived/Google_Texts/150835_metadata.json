Now that it has, that is, as much as we can expect, let\u2019s take a look at what happened this week and what it could signal for Election 2016.\n\nFirst, avid readers of PPD and the PPD Election Projection Model know full well that I am not a big fan of the \u201cdoomed by demographics\u201d school of thought that permeates and dominates conventional wisdom in the Beltway. It is possible to acknowledge that a changing electorate is beneficial to Democrats, while at the same time, refuse to abandon basic lessons taught by American political and electoral history.\n\nThe fact that political coalitions are ever-changing is far more significant than knee-jerk reactions on the panels of network news outlets post Election Day. It\u2019s also extremely important to remember that changing levels of support for a political party and its candidates among a certain bloc of voters do not occur in a vacuum. In other words, even if the GOP nominee fails to increase his or her level of support among Hispanics, for instance, but manages to either return to or exceed historic levels of support among black voters, then they will win. Plain and simple.\n\nOn the night George W. Bush was reelected in 2004, Paul Begala and James Carville lamented over their nominee losing more than 90% of the fasting growing exurbs in the country. In 2012, pundits prematurely took President Obama\u2019s reelection as evidence of a new \u201cemerging Democratic majority,\u201d ignoring the results of the 2010 midterm elections and grossly misreading the impact of the Hispanic vote. Those invested in this new conventional wisdom and what it might mean for the politics of campaigning moving forward, tried to dismiss the 2014 midterm elections by incorrectly blaming low voter turnout.\n\nREAD ALSO \u2014 Top Midterm Myth: Low Turnout Doomed Democrats\n\nThe truth is that when we look at the bigger picture both parties have their own reasons for concern. However, when we consider the demographic edge Democrats should enjoy but aren\u2019t, at least not in non-presidential election cycles, it becomes increasingly apparent that this deficit is more significant and under-reported. The defeats at the ballot box last week serve as a microcosm of what we\u2019re talking about here.\n\nIn Kentucky, Republican Matt Bevin defeated Democrat Jack Conway in the gubernatorial race, becoming only the second GOP state executive in four decades. Bevin, a businessman backed by the Tea Party who embraced Kim Davis and opposed ObamaCare, was the clear favorite on the PPD Election Projection Model, despite polls showing Conway with an edge. But it wasn\u2019t even close, and the results reenforce our expectations that the party will take over the only remaining Southern state legislative body controlled by Democrats in 2016.\n\nAnd here is the crux of the problem for Democrats.\n\nTraditional Democratic voters in Kentucky have been steadily trending Republican on the national level. The 5th Congressional District, a once-competitive region of the state due in large part to the heavily unionized and historically Democratic coal mining constituency, is naturally bailing on the national Democratic Party. Since the era of Obama began in 2008, the 5th District has been bleeding once-loyal Democratic voters.\n\nWhile the \u201cWar on Coal\u201d may be a sound bite for most media outlets, it\u2019s real life for Kentucky coal miners. Coupled with the Democratic Party\u2019s position on social and other economic issues, the old saying \u201cAll politics is local\u201d is becoming less-and-less a factor in an increasingly polarized America.\n\nREAD ALSO \u2014 Obama Rejects Keystone XL Pipeline, Despite Public Opinion and Democrat Division\n\nYet, President Obama rejected the Keystone XL pipeline project on Friday, despite multiple State Department reviews and broad public approval. The anticipated decision absolutely helped cost the party Senate seats in 2014, and while union leaders will not soon back a Republican candidate, it will help to bleed more union member-votes to the benefit of the GOP.\n\n\u201cWe are dismayed and disgusted that the president has once again thrown the members of, and other hard-working, blue-collar workers under the bus of his vaunted \u2018legacy,\u2019 while doing little or nothing to make a real difference in global climate change,\u201d The Laborers\u2019 International Union of North America, or LIUNA said in a statement. \u201cHis actions are shameful.\u201d\n\nIn the most liberal city in the state of Texas, voters rejected the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance by a 2-1 margin, which would\u2019ve allowed the free use of public bathrooms by transgender men and women. It appears that Democrats completely misread support for the transgender movement in light of their victory on same-sex marriage.\n\nYet, in Palatine, Illinois, which is in an otherwise deeply Blue state, public outrage is growing over the Obama administration\u2019s threat to withhold funding from a high school for not permitting a transgender student to use the girls\u2019 locker rooms.\n\nREAD ALSO \u2014 Will SCOTUS Striking Down Same-Sex Marriage Bans Spark Culture War?\n\nI was and remain suspicious of the accuracy of the polls on same-sex marriage. If they were so accurate, then why did proponents of same-sex marriage need the Supreme Court to shut down the debate? Either way, even if we concede they are accurate, interpreting that support to mean a greater acceptance of the transgendered movement is a big mistake. White gentry liberals and black inner-city voters shutdown the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance, not rural white Christians.\n\nOhio voters on Tuesday rejected a ballot proposal to legalize marijuana for both recreational and medical use, despite the primary pro-pot group spending over $12 million in ads. While the polls showed a tight race going into Election Day, the actual voting results weren\u2019t even close. With 99% of precincts reporting, Issue 3, which would\u2019ve allowed adults 21 and older to use, purchase or grow certain amounts of marijuana, was defeated by a 64% to 34% margin.\n\nThere\u2019s a small caveat on Issue 3, however. The perceived monopoly divided the pro-pot forces against the initiative, though that doesn\u2019t explain the terrible polling.\n\nSan Francisco Sheriff Ross Mirkarimi handily lost his bid for reelection Tuesday following months of criticism surrounding his support for sanctuary city policy. Mirkarimi refused to honor an Immigration and Customs Enforcement retainer and allowed Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, a 45-year-old illegal alien with an extensive criminal history that included being deported at least 5 times prior, to walk free. Sanchez is currently being charged by city officials with the murder of 32-year-old Kate Steinle.\n\nREAD ALSO \u2014 Why Hillary Clinton Took Big Risk Backing Obama\u2019s Immigration Order\n\nAccording to a recent poll, 58% want the federal government to cut off funds to cities that provide sanctuary for illegal immigrants, while just 32% disagreed and 10% said they were not sure. Further, 62% of voters said the Department of Justice (DOJ) should take legal action against cities that provide sanctuary for illegal immigrants. Meanwhile, 53% of all voters\u2013including 76% of Republicans\u2013agreed with Donald Trump\u2019s previous comments that illegal immigration increases the level of serious crime in America.\n\nYet, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., blocked a straight up-or-down vote on Kate\u2019s Law, which would impose a mandatory minimum 5-year sentence on illegals caught either in or reentering the country after deportation. Reid\u2019s move, which only prolonged an inevitable vote, followed the blocking of a popular Republican-sponsored bill that would\u2019ve cracked down on sanctuary city policies by threatening to withhold funds to local governments that don\u2019t abide by federal immigration laws. The bill, known as the Stop Sanctuary Cities Act, failed on a 54-45 vote and Republicans failed to peel off a single Democratic vote.\n\nREAD ALSO \u2014 Putting the Hispanic Vote Myth to Bed, Once and For All\n\nWhat does all of this mean for Election 2016?\n\nHillary Clinton has calculated that putting her husband\u2019s old coalition together is too risky for several of the reasons we\u2019ve either argued above, or linked arguments in previous analysis. The campaign believes the Democratic Party has suffered such severe losses among certain voting blocs that the only chance for victory is to cobble together President Obama\u2019s coalition. But there is no evidence to indicate that President Obama\u2019s coalition is an \u201cany Democrat\u201d coalition, and plenty of evidence to suggest otherwise.\n\nUnder Obama, the Republican Party has netted 12 governor mansions, and 13 if you consider an independent in Alaska endorsed by Sarah Palin. In Congress, they lost 69 House seats and 14 Senate seats\u2013the latter could\u2019ve been more if not for poor candidates\u2013and the GOP enjoys the largest majority in the former since the early 1920s (Hoover). Further, down ballot, Democrats have lost 910 seats in state legislatures across the country.\n\nDoes that sound like a party doomed by demographics, or one benefitting from an increasingly radical opposition party?", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Elections, Election Analysis, Election 2016, Hillary Clinton, Polls, Polling, Public Opinion, Republicans, Democrats", "generator": "PPD News Network", "og": {"site_name": "People's Pundit Daily", "description": "Election Data Analysis: Evidence shows Republicans aren't doomed by demographics.
