Anyone wondering why ObamaCare requires enrollees to file ridiculously complex tax forms might just have found their answer.

As the Daily Caller reports, lobbyists for tax preparation giant H&R Block helped shape the Affordable Care Act, and the company now stands to reap a huge financial windfall from the way it was designed.

“H&R Block is well positioned to earn more than $100 million in additional fees from low-income ObamaCare enrollees,” says the Caller’s Richard Pollack.

That accusation hardly seems like a stretch when you look at Form 8962, which anyone who gets ObamaCare subsidies is now required to fill out.

This two-page, 36-step monstrosity is a professional tax preparer’s dream, requiring filers to record monthly family income, perform numerous calculations and try to understand pages of absolutely arcane instructions.

And since ObamaCare subsidies are available only to middle-class families on the lower end of the income spectrum, it means that many who simply filed the 1040EZ in the past will now have to pay a professional to do their taxes.

Adding insult to injury, most of these folks will find that they owe some, a lot or all of the ObamaCare subsidies back to the federal government, according to H&R Block’s own research.

It found that, on average, these families will have to return $530 worth of ObamaCare premium subsidies, which is equal to 17% of the average tax refund.

“The level of payback,” said company VP Mark Ciaramitaro, “is significant in that it’s costing taxpayers a large percentage of their refund — a refund many of them count on to pay household expenses.”

These are subsidies, mind you, that were paid directly to insurance companies to offset the cost of ObamaCare’s premiums. Yet it’s the taxpayer that has to refund the money.

If this doesn’t make sense, maybe H&R Block can explain it. For a fee.
