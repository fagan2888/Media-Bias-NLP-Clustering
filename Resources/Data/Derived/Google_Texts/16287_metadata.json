Members of the group \u2014 nearing 200 women from 16 to 70 years of age \u2014 meet quarterly to learn about different organizations that help people in need and contribute $50 each to one of those groups.\n\nThat first meeting generated just more than $5,000 for Simple Gifts, a Portland nonprofit that provides gas cards and other financial support to patients in local hospitals or their families.\n\nDuring the first four meetings, the group gave between $6,000 and $6,500 to One Warrior Won, which provides support to veterans and members of the military struggling with post-traumatic stress; the Cromwell Center for Disabilities Awareness; and Furniture Friends, which works with other organizations to provide free used furniture to those in need.\n\nEarlier this month, the group donated nearly $6,000 \u2014 although checks are still coming in \u2014 to Saint Andre Home to help fund a new branch of Hope Rising, a residential treatment program for survivors of human trafficking.\n\nOften, the women are learning about the organization for the first time \u2014 which Bergeron said is part of the goal.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m telling you, it was hard to hear about,\u201d Bergeron said of the presentation by Beth Ansheles of Saint Andre Home. \u201cPeople didn\u2019t realize how big it is here in Maine. It was such an education.\u201d\n\nEach meeting opens with a time for \u201cnetworking,\u201d and then the women hear five-minute presentations from three fellow members about a different nonprofit organization \u2014 frequently members of the group\u2019s board of directors or a volunteer.\n\nThen the women vote, and each write checks to the organization with the most votes.\n\nBut Bergeron said members frequently write additional checks to the organizations they learn about.\n\nBergeron is thrilled the group is growing so quickly, and she hopes other branches are formed throughout the state.\n\n\u201cYou walk in that room and it\u2019s amazing,\u201d she said. \u201cWe take what we do seriously, and we do it in the spirit of community.\u201d\n\n100+ Women Who Care Southern Maine will next meet Feb. 9, 2016, at the Woodfords Club in Portland.
