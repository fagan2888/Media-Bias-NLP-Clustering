Everything has to work, every time, no matter what.\n\nThat's why the Navy still uses fuse boxes, because fuses work when circuit breakers fail.\n\nThe U.S. Pioneer name, and Tulsa, is stamped on almost everything.\n\nSeth Lapidus said, \"If you're a sailor, you have your hands on something from Tulsa. Guaranteed, guaranteed.\"\n\nU.S. Pioneer is one of the more prominent, but there are other Tulsa companies with contracts to build components for Navy ships. So when the Tulsa sails, plenty of local pride will go along with it.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "When the USS Tulsa sets sail in a few years, the Navy ship won't just have Tulsa in big letters on the outside; it will have Tulsa all over the inside.", "author": "Emory Bryan", "og": {"url": "http://www.newson6.com/story/30103190/uss-tulsa-represents-city-inside-and-out", "image": "http://KOTV.images.worldnow.com/images/8866358_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "When the USS Tulsa sets sail in a few years, the Navy ship won't just have Tulsa in big letters on the outside; it will have Tulsa all over the inside.", "title": "USS Tulsa Represents City Inside And Out"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KOTV.images.worldnow.com/images/8866358_G.jpg", "description": "When the USS Tulsa sets sail in a few years, the Navy ship won't just have Tulsa in big letters on the outside; it will have Tulsa all over the inside.", "card": "summary", "title": "USS Tulsa Represents City Inside And Out"}, "wnreadableurl": "uss-tulsa-represents-city-inside-and-out", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "owner": "KOTV", "fb": {"app_id": 497059410331845}, "date": "2015/09/23", "KEYWORDS": "tulsa,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,kotv.com,channel 6,channel six,green country,television,the news on 6,the news on six,six in the morning,live", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS26", "verify-v1": "67+ifqPKEX7ZTB2sopjxTD1c6nx6ScxupNN92EqnIpc=", "news_keywords": "tulsa,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,kotv.com,channel 6,channel six,green country,television,the news on 6,the news on six,six in the morning,live"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd79c1\"", "article_summary": "U.S. Pioneer builds 1,000 different components in Tulsa, and many - like navigation lights - are used on ships like the Tulsa.\nWhen the USS Tulsa sets sail in a few years, the Navy ship won't just have Tulsa in big letters on the outside; it will have Tulsa all over the inside, as thousands of pieces of the ship are being made in Tulsa.\nThe company builds 1,000 different components in Tulsa, and many - like navigation lights - are used on ships like the Tulsa.\nU.S. Pioneer is one of the more prominent, but there are other Tulsa companies with contracts to build components for Navy ships.\nThe company, and related predecessors, has a history with the Navy since 1936 - and with Tulsa since 1968."}
