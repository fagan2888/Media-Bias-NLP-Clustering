While his call for a repeal could gain traction among some conservative lawmakers, Mr. Patrick could face criticism from business groups that support the law, and could hurt the efforts of Republicans who are trying to reach out to Hispanic voters.\n\n\u201cIt unfortunately can serve as a detriment to our outreach efforts,\u201d said George Antuna, a founder of Hispanic Republicans of Texas, adding that most Hispanic Republicans considered the law good policy. His organization recruits and supports Hispanic Republicans running for office.\n\nThe Texas Dream Act allows undocumented immigrants who graduate from Texas high schools and have lived in the state for at least three years to pay in-state tuition at public community colleges and universities. The act has been popular among Hispanics, while many Texas Republicans who identify with the Tea Party disapprove of the law.\n\nWhile Mr. Patrick did not respond to a request for comment, he has said that he would work to repeal the law, which he equates with giving people who entered the country illegally a leg up in the admissions process. In a recent fund-raising letter, Mr. Patrick wrote that he opposed \u201ctaxpayer-funded benefits for illegal immigrants.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Patrick is also likely to face opposition from the Texas Association of Business, which recently endorsed him. (The association is a corporate sponsor of The Texas Tribune.)\n\n\u201cWe think in-state tuition is a very appropriate response to the fact that we need more Texans going to college and completing college,\u201d the association\u2019s chief executive, Bill Hammond, said, adding that the group\u2019s endorsement of Mr. Patrick was not an endorsement of all his positions. \u201cWe choose to disagree with him respectfully on this issue.\u201d\n\nThere have been several failed attempts by state lawmakers, including Mr. Patrick, to repeal the Dream Act. Such efforts have not gained traction.\n\nBut the 31-member State Senate is likely to be more conservative in the coming legislative session, and only one of the Republican senators who voted to pass the law will return in January.\n\nMs. Van de Putte described Mr. Patrick\u2019s opposition to the tuition law as \u201canti-education\u201d for the state\u2019s immigrants because repealing the act could keep Texas residents who \u201care here by no fault of their own\u201d from attending college. \u201cHis first order of business is to repeal something that has been working in our state for 13 years,\u201d Ms. Van de Putte said.\n\nFurther efforts to repeal the law will come after Gov. Rick Perry, who signed it into law and has adamantly defended it, leaves in January. Without the threat of a veto, Republicans who oppose the bill but were apprehensive about the ramifications of a repeal would be left with no \u201ccover\u201d to oppose a repeal, according to Mark P. Jones, a political scientist at Rice University. (Rice is a corporate sponsor of The Tribune.)\n\nMr. Jones said there was likely to be a close and controversial Senate vote to repeal the law, although it could run into \u201cinsurmountable\u201d obstacles in the House and among Republicans looking to connect with Hispanics.\n\n\u201cThis is a losing issue for Republicans\u201d even if they block an attempt to repeal, Mr. Jones said. \u201cA strong and visible effort to repeal would be devastating.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140920192841, "twitter": {"description": "State Senator Dan Patrick, who is running
