Yet there were still a few hiccups: On Saturday, an HHS spokesperson acknowledged that \"intermittent issues\" has prevented some consumers from completing their applications.\n\nHealthCare.gov, which now serves 37 states, had nearly 7.75 million customers who had selected or been automatically re-enrolled for 2015 plans as of Feb. 6.
