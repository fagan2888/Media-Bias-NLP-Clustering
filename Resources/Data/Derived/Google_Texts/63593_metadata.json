Beaulieu fled the scene and was seen crossing the I-4 median and entering eastbound traffic, deputies said.\n\nShe hit the driver\u2019s side of a 2008 Mercedes, driven by Nawar Badeea Jaafar Blaibel, of Tampa, who had an adult and three small children between 1 and 4 in his vehicle, deputies said.\n\nThe collision caused Beaulieu\u2019s Jeep to rotate and flip. As it was airborne it hit a 2012 Chevrolet Silverado pickup truck, driven by Ricky Lyle Rice, 56, of Jacksonville, according to the report.\n\nThe bottom of the Jeep struck the front of the pickup, leaving an impression of the complete tire tread horizontally across the front of the truck, deputies said. The pickup, which was towing a trailer with two motorcycles, spun across several lanes of traffic.\n\nThe Jeep continued tumbling across multiple lanes. The force of the impacts caused the frame to break in half from the driver\u2019s side to the passenger side, deputies said. The driver\u2019s seat broke and Beaulieu, who was wearing a seat belt, was ejected. She was found laying face down on the north side of the eastbound lanes and died at the scene, deputies said.\n\nA 2014 Jeep Liberty, driven by Angel Luis Valentin, of Tampa, was struck by debris, damaging the vehicle.\n\nRice was taken to Lakeland Regional Medical Center were he was listed in critical condition. Blaibel and the three children were also taken to LRMC, where they were treated and released.\n\nValentin and his passenger were uninjured.\n\nNo one had been charged though the investigation is ongoing, deputies said.", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sun, 09 Nov 2014 13:12:54 -0400", "Description": "A woman who was killed in a three-vehicle crash that closed the eastbound lanes of Interstate 4 for several hours Saturday was fleeing after being involved in another crash in the westbound lanes, de", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "A woman who was killed in a three-vehicle crash that closed the eastbound lanes of Interstate 4 for several hours Saturday was fleeing after being involved in another crash in the westbound lanes, de", "title": "Woman killed in I-4 crash was fleeing accident, deputies say", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/news/woman-killed-in-i-4-crash-was-fleeing-accident-deputies-say-20141109/", "image": {"width": 200, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/staticimage/images/new_og_icon.png", "height": 200}, "updated_time": "2014-11-09T13:12:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Woman killed in I-4 crash was fleeing accident, deputies say"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2014-11-09T13:12:54Z-04", "modified_time": "2014-11-09T13:12:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd300\"", "article_summary": "A woman who was killed in a three-vehicle crash that closed the eastbound lanes of Interstate 4 for several hours Saturday was fleeing after being involved in another crash in the westbound lanes, deputies said.\nAs it was airborne it hit a 2012 Chevrolet Silverado pickup truck, driven by Ricky Lyle Rice, 56, of Jacksonville, according to the report.\nShe was found laying face down on the north side of the eastbound lanes and died at the scene, deputies said.\nBeaulieu fled the scene and was seen crossing the I-4 median and entering eastbound traffic, deputies said.\nThe bottom of the Jeep struck the front of the pickup, leaving an impression of the complete tire tread horizontally across the front of the truck, deputies said."}
