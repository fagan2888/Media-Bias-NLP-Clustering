As mobile technology evolves so does the way we send pornography messages. A team of researchers has blamed this surge in sexually explicit texts, or sexts as they\u2019re commonly known as, not on human nature but on the media. According to their finding there is a strong correlation between teens who watch a lot of music videos and high levels of sexting.\n\nResearchers from the University of Antwerp surveyed 329 students aged between the ages of 15 and 18 at schools in Flanders, Belgium. The Daily Mail reported that the students were asked questions pertaining to how often they used the Internet, watched music videos, and viewed online porn. They were also asked how often they sexted others, had been asked to send a sext, or had been sent either a sexual image or video from another person.\n\n\u201cThe results of our study show that various types of sexting behavior are significantly linked with both pornography and music video consumption,\u2019 said lead researcher Joris Van Ouytsel, as reported by The Daily Mail.\n\nAccording to the student\u2019s answers, this link between watching porn and sending sexual messages was found in both boys and girls.\n\nIt seems that viewing music videos online may induce interesting behavior in teens. The researchers found that students who viewed music videos online were more likely to ask others to send them sexually explicit images. This link was seen strongest among the boys who had partook in the study. Also it seemed that the students who received sexting were more likely to watch more online music videos.\n\nThis pattern was seen stronger amongst the boys who had partaken in the study than the girl participants.\n\n\u201cThe results demonstrate that sexting behaviors were significantly associated with the consumption of pornography, when controlling for age, gender, and internet use,\u201d Van Ouytsel explained. \u201cMusic video consumption was only significantly associated with asking someone for a sexting message and having received a sexting message.\u201d\n\nAlthough the prominence of sexting may not sound particularly worrying, it is when the sext is either sent or received by a minor. It\u2019s here were the situation can go from embarrassing to illegal. A 2012 study on teen sexting behaviors concluded that teen-focused health care providers should consider screening for sexting behaviors in to provide the best age-specific education on the potential consequences.\n\nSource: Van Ouystel J, Ponnet K, Walrave M.
