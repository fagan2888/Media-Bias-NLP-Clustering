It expects to begin building a demonstration project in 2017.\n\nXu Dazhe, head of China's atomic safety commission, told reporters in January the floating platforms were in the planning stage and must undergo \"strict and scientific demonstrations\".\n\nChinese naval expert Li Jie told the Global Times the platforms could power lighthouses, defense facilities, airports and harbors in the South China Sea. \"Normally we have to burn oil or coal for power,\" Li said.\n\nIt was important to develop a maritime nuclear power platform as changing weather and ocean conditions presented a challenge in transporting fuel to the distant Spratlys, he added.\n\nChina claims almost the entire South China Sea, believed to have huge deposits of oil and gas, and is building islands on reefs to bolster its claims. Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam also have claims to parts of the waters, through which about $5 trillion in trade is shipped every year.\n\n(Additional reporting by David Stanway; Editing by Clarence Fernandez)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "BEIJING (Reuters) - China is getting closer to building maritime nuclear power platfor", "title": "China could build nuclear plants for South China Sea, paper says", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/22/China-could-build-nuclear-plants-South-China-Sea-paper-says", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/southchinasea-china_3.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/22/China-could-build-nuclear-plants-South-China-Sea-paper-says", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/southchinasea-china_3.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "BEIJING (Reuters) - China is getting closer to building maritime nuclear power platfor", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "In January, two Chinese state-owned energy companies, China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) and China General Nuclear Power Corporation (CGN), signed a strategic cooperation framework pact on offshore oil and nuclear power.\n\"The development of nuclear power platforms is a burgeoning trend,\" Liu told the paper.\nChina claims almost the entire South China Sea, believed to have huge deposits of oil and gas, and is building islands on reefs to bolster its claims.\nChinese naval expert Li Jie told the Global Times the platforms could power lighthouses, defense facilities, airports and harbors in the South China Sea.\nThe Global Times, an influential tabloid published by the ruling Communist Party's official People's Daily, said the nuclear power platforms could \"sail\" to remote areas and provide a stable power supply."}
