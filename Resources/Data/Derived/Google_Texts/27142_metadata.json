It will be hard for Rousseff to reach agreement with the opposition on the austerity agenda,\" said Gabriel Petrus, an analyst with consultancy Barral M Jorge Associates in Brasilia.\n\nBATTLES IN CONGRESS\n\nAt stake is a bill to reduce a key fiscal savings goal this year. Without its approval by Nov. 30, the government will be forced to drastically cut expenditures, officials told Reuters.\n\nMembers of Rousseff's Workers' Party, such as congressman Henrique Fontana, fear her opponents will try to use Amaral's arrest to further disrupt the government's legislative agenda.\n\n\"The opposition will try to use this to paralyze Congress, create an institutional crisis,\" said Fontana. \"We won't let that happen. We will push ahead with the austerity plan.\"\n\nProsecutors say Brazil's top engineering firms ran schemes in which an estimated $2 billion was siphoned off overpriced contracts in kickbacks and bribes paid to Petrobras executives and dozens of politicians, mainly from the governing coalition.\n\nAndre Esteves, the billionaire CEO and controlling shareholder of Latin America's biggest investment bank, BTG Pactual SA, was also arrested on Wednesday.\n\nInvestors fear the scandal could bring down Esteves' bank and also make it impossible for Rousseff to win support for the unpopular austerity measures needed to cut into Brazil's budget deficit, which has ballooned to more than 9 percent of GDP.\n\nShares in BTG Pactual slumped 21 percent on Wednesday and the broader stock market index and real currency also fell sharply. Market prices were more stable on Thursday, but the bank's stock was off another 3 percent.\n\n(Reporting by Alonso Soto and Anthony Boadle; Editing by Kieran Murray)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "BRASILIA (Reuters) - President Dilma Rousseff\u2019s austerity program to fix Brazil's shak", "title": "Brazil arrests push Petrobras probe back to Rousseff's door", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/11/26/Brazil-arrests-push-Petrobras-probe-back-Rousseffs-door", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/brazil-senator-arrest_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/11/26/Brazil-arrests-push-Petrobras-probe-back-Rousseffs-door", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/brazil-senator-arrest_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "BRASILIA (Reuters) - President Dilma Rousseff\u2019s austerity program to fix Brazil's shak", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The Petrobras scandal combined with an economic recession led to opposition calls for Rousseff's impeachment earlier this year, and polls show most Brazilians want her unseated.\nMembers of Rousseff's Workers' Party, such as congressman Henrique Fontana, fear her opponents will try to use Amaral's arrest to further disrupt the government's legislative agenda.\n\"The arrest felt like a nuclear bomb here in the presidential palace,\" said a Rousseff aide who asked for anonymity.\nShares in BTG Pactual slumped 21 percent on Wednesday and the broader stock market index and real currency also fell sharply.\n\"The opposition will try to use this to paralyze Congress, create an institutional crisis,\" said Fontana."}
