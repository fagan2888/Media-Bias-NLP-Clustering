The campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, and Trump have denied the accusation. Lewandowski dismissed Fields as an \"attention seeker\" on Twitter.\n\nFields published her account at Breitbart on Thursday of what happened when reporters gathered around Trump to ask him additional questions after a press conference.\n\nFields said she asked Trump about his views on affirmative action.\n\n\"Trump acknowledged the question, but before he could answer I was jolted backwards. Someone had grabbed me tightly by the arm and yanked me down. I almost fell to the ground, but was able to maintain my balance. Nonetheless, I was shaken,\" Fields wrote.\n\nA Trump campaign spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, questioned Fields' story on Friday. Hicks said she had not seen any encounter and said no cameras had captured the incident.\n\nFields, who posted a photo on Twitter of bruises on her arm, initially said she did not know who had grabbed her and caused her to stumble.\n\nBen Terris, a Washington Post reporter who witnessed the incident, told her Lewandowski had seized her arm. He wrote his own account for his newspaper.\n\nThe political news site Politico posted a transcript of an audio recording of the incident, which included an exchange between Terris and Fields.\n\n\"Yeah he just threw you down,\" Terris said to Fields, who replied, \"I can't believe he just did that. That was so hard. Was that Corey?\"\n\nTerris said that it was and later reported that Fields was tearful after the incident.\n\nIn a statement on Friday, Breitbart Chief Executive Officer Larry Solov said Trump's suggestion that Fields may have invented the episode was contradicted by the evidence.\n\n\"Breitbart News stands behind Michelle Fields,\" he wrote.\n\nHours later, however, the website posted a story disputing Terris' account. The story said that footage from the event showed Trump flanked by two men: Lewandowski and a security official who bore some resemblance to the campaign manager.\n\n\"The person who made contact with Fields was likely not Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski,\" the report said.\n\nTerris stood by his account on Friday. He was quoted in a blog by Washington Post reporter Erik Wemple as saying, \"I saw what I saw.\" Terris did not immediately respond to an email requesting comment.\n\nFields and Solov could not immediately be reached for comment on the complaint to police.\n\nTrump's rallies across the United States have been marked by rowdiness and physical contact between protesters and either his supporters or security personnel. At a rally in Virginia on Feb. 29, a Time magazine photographer trying to document the exit of dozens of black protesters was grabbed by the neck and shoved to the ground by a U.S. Secret Service agent.\n\nWhite House spokesman Josh Earnest also weighed in on the Fields incident on Friday, telling reporters: \"There is no excuse or justification for acts of violence against reporters who are covering a political event.\"\n\n(Reporting by Joseph Ax; Additional reporting by Colleen Jenkins and Jeff Mason; editing by Grant McCool)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "(Reuters) - A reporter for the conservative website Breitbart News filed a criminal co", "title": "Reporter files criminal charge of battery against Trump campaign chief", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/03/11/Reporter-files-criminal-charge-battery-against-Trump-campaign-chief", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-election-trump_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/03/11/Reporter-files-criminal-charge-battery-against-Trump-campaign-chief", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-election-trump_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "(Reuters) - A reporter for the conservative website Breitbart News filed a criminal co", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "\"The person who made contact with Fields was likely not Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski,\" the report said.\nThe accusation prompted a flurry of exchanges between Trump's campaign and Fields.\nA Trump campaign spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, questioned Fields' story on Friday.\nHours later, however, the website posted a story disputing Terris' account.\nThe campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, and Trump have denied the accusation."}
