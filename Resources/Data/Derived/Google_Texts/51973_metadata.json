Because people applying on healthcare.gov could be eligible for either Medicaid or Marketplace coverage, we will be providing info on voter registration to people who request it.\"\n\nCould this give Democrats a political advantage? Potentially, since they stand to benefit the most from a surge in voter registration among those who currently lack insurance. By more than a 2 to 1 ratio, uninsured Americans supported Barack Obama over Republican Mitt Romney in a Washington Post-Kaiser Family Foundation poll last summer (62 to 27 percent). Obama led by a smaller eight-point margin among those who have health insurance. African Americans and Hispanics make up roughly half of the nation's uninsured, a factor that explains much of the political divide.\n\nTake a look at this chart, which gives a sense of the disparity in voting patterns between the insured and uninsured:\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the impact of the voter registration option will also be limited by two key factors. Fully one in five of the nation's uninsured are not U.S. citizens, making them ineligible to vote at all, a factor that helps explain why the Post-Kaiser poll found just 64 percent of uninsured respondents are registered, 22 points below the national average.\n\nSecond, making voter registration easier doesn't always result in a boost in turnout. The same law that accounts for why Obamacare now presents a voting registration opportunity had only mixed effects on turnout after it was enacted. Turnout increased by roughly five percentage points in states that used combined forms for the DMV and voter registration or actively encouraged registration, wrote Political Scientist Benjamin Highton in a 2004 article summarizing research about the law. But in states that made less of an effort, turnout hardly moved.\n\nPerhaps that explains why this development, which was first reported by Mother Jones on Tuesday, has not become a new rallying cry in conservatives' efforts to overturn the president's health care law.\n\n\u201cWe are less concerned with the voter registration element of the enrollment application, and more concerned about defunding the law or at least getting a delay in the individual mandate,\" wrote Dean Clancey, director of policy for the conservative group FreedomWorks, in an e-mail. \"Regardless of what\u2019s on the enrollment application, the greater point is that enrollment in ObamaCare should be voluntary.
