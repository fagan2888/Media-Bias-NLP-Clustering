(AP) \u2014 Instead of doing some last-minute shopping or wrapping gifts, families across the South spent Christmas Eve taking stock of their losses after an unusual outbreak of December tornadoes and other violent weather killed at least 14 people and damaged or destroyed dozens of homes.\n\n\u201cSanta brought us a good one, didn\u2019t he?\u201d Bobby Watkins said as he and his wife took a walk amid the destruction in rural Benton County, Mississippi, where four people \u2014 including a married couple and two neighbors on the same street \u2014 were confirmed dead and their homes destroyed. \u201cI may have lost some stuff, but I got my life.\u201d\n\nUnseasonably warm weather Wednesday helped spawn twisters from Arkansas to Michigan. The line of springlike storms continued marching east Thursday, dumping torrential rain that flooded roads in Alabama and caused a mudslide in the mountains of Georgia.\n\nAuthorities confirmed seven deaths in Mississippi, including that of a 7-year-old boy who was in a car that was swept up and tossed by a storm. Six more died in Tennessee. One person was killed in Arkansas.\n\nDozens more were injured, some seriously, said Greg Flynn, spokesman for the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency.\n\nSearch teams combed damaged homes and businesses for people still missing, including at least one man in hard-hit Benton County. The hunt was made complicated because so many had left for the holidays.\n\n\u201cUntil they know for sure where those folks are, they\u2019re going to keep looking, because we\u2019ve had in some cases houses leveled, and they\u2019re just not there anymore,\u201d Flynn said.\n\nIn Linden, Tennessee, Tony Goodwin ducked into a storm shelter with seven others as the storm passed. He emerged to find his house had been knocked off its foundation and down the hill.\n\nHe managed to climb inside and fetch some Christmas gifts that had been under his tree. Goodwin\u2019s neighbors weren\u2019t so fortunate. Two people in one home were killed.\n\n\u201cIt makes you thankful to be alive with your family,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s what Christmas is all about.\u201d\n\nChris Shupiery grabbed his Santa hat along with a chain saw as he set out to help clean up on Thursday. He cut up fallen trees not far from Goodwin\u2019s home.\n\n\u201cThis was just the right thing to do, come help a family in need,\u201d Shupiery said. \u201cSuit up, try to cheer people up and try to make them feel a little better with Christmas coming around.\u201d\n\nIn Benton County, Mississippi, relatives helped Daisy and Charles Johnson clean up after the storm flattened their house. They carried some of the couple\u2019s belongings past a Santa Claus figure on a table.\n\nDaisy Johnson, 68, said she and her husband rushed along with other relatives to their storm shelter across the street from the house after they heard a twister was headed their way.\n\n\u201cWe looked straight west of us and there it was. It was yellow and it was roaring, lightning just continually, and it was making a terrible noise,\u201d she said. \u201cI never want to hear that again for as long as I live.\u201d\n\nMona Ables, 43, was driving home when the storm hit. She abandoned her car, ran to a house and banged on a window, seeking shelter.\n\nThe startled man inside couldn\u2019t open the door, which appeared to be blocked, Ables said. She huddled next to the house as another stranger pulled up, also looking for shelter.\n\n\u201cHe and I just huddled together and saw trees fly past us, and a shipping container flip over,\u201d Ables said. \u201cAnd as the debris started hitting us, he just covered me, and within a minute it was all over and there was destruction all around us and we were fine.\u201d\n\nPeak tornado season in the South is in the spring, but such storms can happen at any time. Exactly a year ago, twisters hit Mississippi, killing five people and injuring dozens.\n\nGlenda Hunt, 69, was cooking chicken and making dressing Wednesday night at her Benton County home, where Christmas Eve lunch is a family tradition, when her daughter called to warn her of the approaching storm.\n\nHunt and her husband ducked into their storm shelter and wrestled the door shut against the wind\u2019s powerful suction. She started praying when she heard sheet metal hitting trees.\n\nOn Thursday, heavy farm equipment and corn were strewn across the couple\u2019s property. Their house sustained heavy structural damage but was still standing.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re OK and that\u2019s all that matters,\u201d Hunt said. \u201cBut the Lord did save my furniture.\u201d\n\n___\n\nSchelzig reported from Linden, Tennessee; Associated Press writers Josh Replogle in Miami; Jeff Martin in Atlanta; Claudia Lauer in Little Rock, Arkansas; and Jay Reeves in Birmingham, Alabama, contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Instead of doing some last-minute shopping or wrapping gifts, families across the South spent Christmas Eve taking stock of their losses after an unusual outbreak of December tornadoes and other violent weather killed at least 14 people and damaged or destroyed dozens of homes.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Instead of doing some last-minute shopping or wrapping gifts, families across the South spent Christmas Eve taking stock of their losses after an unusual outbreak of December tornadoes and other violent weather killed at least 14 people and damaged or destroyed dozens of homes.", "title": "Christmastime tornadoes ravage South; at least 14 killed", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/dec/25/christmastime-tornadoes-ravage-south-least-14-kill/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/12/24/Severe_Weather.JPEG-0052c.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/12/24/Severe_Weather.JPEG-0052c.jpg", "description": "Instead of doing some last-minute shopping or wrapping gifts, families across the South spent Christmas Eve taking stock of their losses after an unusual outbreak of December tornadoes and other viole", "card": "summary", "title": "Christmastime tornadoes ravage South; at least 14 killed"}, "Author": "Phillip Lucas and Erik Schelzig", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Disaster Accident, Christmas Eve, Linden"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf172\"", "article_summary": "Search teams combed damaged homes and businesses for people still missing, including at least one man in hard-hit Benton County.\nIn Linden, Tennessee, Tony Goodwin ducked into a storm shelter with seven others as the storm passed.\nHunt and her husband ducked into their storm shelter and wrestled the door shut against the wind\u2019s powerful suction.\nAuthorities confirmed seven deaths in Mississippi, including that of a 7-year-old boy who was in a car that was swept up and tossed by a storm.\n\u201cI may have lost some stuff, but I got my life.\u201dUnseasonably warm weather Wednesday helped spawn twisters from Arkansas to Michigan."}
