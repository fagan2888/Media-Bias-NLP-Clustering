Kansas was one of seven states singled out for closer scrutiny.\n\nAnd while much of what Sunflower State residents said followed national trends, there were some notable exceptions. Of all the states surveyed, Kansas is where the Affordable Care Act is the least popular.\n\nRobert Blendon of Harvard\u2019s T.H. Chan School of Public Health was primarily in charge of conducting the poll.\n\nHe said of Kansans surveyed, 26 percent thought things improved as a result of the ACA and 13 percent thought their own lives were helped. \u201cBut in terms of the overall figures, people were much more negative about the impact on Kansas as a whole and about individuals,\u201d Blendon said.\n\nMore than a third of Kansans surveyed \u2014 39 percent \u2014 thought the health care law has been detrimental to the state. That compares with 27 percent nationwide. Blendon sees two main factors behind these numbers for Kansans.\n\nThere is \u201ca real concern, greater than the other states, about the cost of health care for them and the state,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the other is this sense of concern that many Republicans have that the law wasn\u2019t the right thing to do. The two together is why I think Kansas stands out as being more critical of the ACA than other states.\u201d\n\nThe Kansans with the most negative views about the health care law tend to be older than 65, live in rural areas and identify as Republican. They also say their health care costs are unreasonable and they have experienced serious financial problems as a result. The extent of their worry about costs surprised Blendon.\n\n\u201cKansans are much more concerned about rising health care costs than people in other states,\u201d he said. \u201cThey think they\u2019re going up. They\u2019re more concerned about the future.\u201d\n\nThe finding that a lot of Kansans are not happy with the Affordable Care Act comes as no surprise to Mike Walker, assistant director of the Docking Institute of Public Affairs at Fort Hays State University. The institute has been doing its own polling of Kansans for seven years.\n\n\u201cWe did see in our own data that Kansans were not favorable toward ACA overall,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was a large portion that were favorable, but the majority of folks were not.\u201d Walker said Kansans almost always vote Republican. What\u2019s more, he said,\n\nPresident Barack Obama is not popular in Kansas, and that carries over to his signature health care law, informally referred to as Obamacare. \u201cA lot of Kansans just seem to dislike Obama, more specifically,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I think those two things sort of lay a foundation for just opposing something that a Democratic president might come up with, and especially Obama.\u201d\n\nWalker said while it\u2019s clear that Kansans are concerned about health care costs, it\u2019s not clear whether those cost increases are real and actually caused by Obamacare.\n\n\u201cMy experience tells me that people that have experienced their cost going up, or perceive that their costs are going up, are more likely to be vocal about the issue and complain about the ACA,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cFolks that aren\u2019t impacted by it aren\u2019t going to say anything about it.\u201d If costs are increasing significantly, Walker said, it might be because people have more comprehensive coverage now thanks to the ACA \u2014 something they may not appreciate until they get sick or injured.\n\nWalker said the health reform law is complicated, and it\u2019s understandable that people might be confused about it, especially with persistent attacks on Obamacare from the state\u2019s political leaders.\n\n\u201cBut I kind of think that people don\u2019t want to understand these issues, because it runs like a brick wall against their support for the Republican Party and their opposition to Obama in general,\u201d he said. Walker said the real test will be to see how Kansans\u2019 attitudes toward the ACA evolve over time as they have more experience with the health reform law and the health care system.\n\nBryan Thompson is a reporter for KHI News Service in Topeka, a partner in the Heartland Health Monitor team.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Salina Post", "description": "By BRYAN THOMPSON A new poll from NPR, Harvard University and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation explores Americans\u2019 experiences with the health care system in the two years since the Affordable Ca\u2026", "title": "Poll: Health reform, costs of care concern Kansans", "url": "http://salinapost.com/2016/03/01/poll-health-reform-costs-of-care-concern-kansans/", "image": {"width": 683, "identifier": "http://thepost.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-01-at-6.31.18-AM.png", "height": 311}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://thepost.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-01-at-6.31.18-AM.png?w=640", "site": "@salinapost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@SalinaPost"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "fb": {"pages": 143823675648948}, "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-01T19:01:15+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-01T17:56:30+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "They also say their health care costs are unreasonable and they have experienced serious financial problems as a result.\nMore than a third of Kansans surveyed \u2014 39 percent \u2014 thought the health care law has been detrimental to the state.\n\u201cKansans are much more concerned about rising health care costs than people in other states,\u201d he said.\nThere is \u201ca real concern, greater than the other states, about the cost of health care for them and the state,\u201d he said.\nWalker said the real test will be to see how Kansans\u2019 attitudes toward the ACA evolve over time as they have more experience with the health reform law and the health care system."}
