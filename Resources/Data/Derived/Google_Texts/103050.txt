Two male co-hosts on Fox News’ “The Five” cracked needlessly sexist, inappropriate “jokes” on Wednesday, poking fun at the UAE’s first female fighter pilot. While co-host Kimberly Guilfoyle lauded Maj. Mariam Al Mansouri, who reportedly led the UAE airstrikes against the Islamic State, dudebros Greg Gutfield and Eric Bolling took a moment to diminish the pilot’s accomplishments.

“I’ll take a woman doing this [bombing] any day to them,” Guilfoyle said. “I hope that hurt extra bad … because in some Arab countries, women can’t even drive.”

“The problem is, after she bombed it she couldn’t park it,” Gutfield added. “I salute her.”
