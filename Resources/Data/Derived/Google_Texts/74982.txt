Another day, another earthquake in …. No big deal, right? Especially when compared to the 4.0-magnitude temblor that rattled Venus Thursday evening.

That said, Saturday morning’s wake-and-shake was felt from Irving to Northwest Dallas to Deep Ellum, according to my Twitter timeline and inbox. It was the usual: a small boom followed by a brief housequake.

It took a while, but the U.S. Geological Survey confirms what many of us felt at 11:12 a.m.: a 2.7-magnitude quake along the same-ol’ familiar fault line running from Irving to Dallas. Today’s temblor was near Bachman Lake — about 3 miles beneath Northwest Highway between Marsh and Midway. Which reminds me: Need to hit the Target today.
