Frascona was killed Sunday along with his girlfriend, Tori Rains-Wedan, 41, and her three children \u2014 Mason; 15, and 11-year-old twins Austin and Hunter . A dog was also killed in the crash.\n\n\u201cEveryone is really sad. We lost a true reality friend,\u201d Jolon Ruch, chairwoman of the Colorado Association of Realtors, said Saturday. \u201cHe wore the Realtor \u2018R\u2019 on his sleeve. I really respected him for that.\u201d\n\nThe association sent e-mails to its member Sunday night confirming the tragedy, Ruch said.\n\nAuthorities had earlier released the plane\u2019s identification number. The plane is registered to The Real Estate School LLC and Frascona is the registered agent of the plane, a Piper PA-46.\n\nThe Weld County Coroner\u2019s Office is performing autopsies on Labor Day.\n\nFrascona trained hundreds of real estate brokers in the Denver metro area on real estate law, colleagues said.\n\n\u201cHis classes were always filled because he was charismatic and fun,\u201d Ruch said. \u201cI always referred to him as the enter-trainer because he truly was an entertainer.\u201d\n\nJon Goodman was Franscona\u2019s partner for 21 years.\n\n\u201cEveryone on that plane touched the lives of many. The law firm morns their tragic death. May they all live on in the memories of those that loved them,\u201d Goodman said in a statement released Saturday.\n\nThe plane, which crashed upside down, had departed from Centennial Airport and was headed for the Erie Municipal Airport when it crashed in a field near a residential neighborhood, authorities said Sunday.\n\nWitnesses told reporters that they heard the plane sputtering before it went completely silent.\n\n\u201cWe knew it crashed,\u201d Jan Culver told the Daily Camera.\n\nFrascona lived a short distance away from where the crash happened, said acquaintances, who added that he was an avid and very experienced pilot.\n\nFrascona was a partner in the well-established Boulder firm of Frascona, Joiner, Goodman and Greenstein P.C.\n\nPhotos of the scene showed the mangled wreckage of the six-passenger Piper, its wings just barely attached to the fuselage.\n\nKirk Mitchell: 303-954-1206, denverpost.com/coldcases or twitter.com/kirkmitchell", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Friends identify pilot of Erie plane that crashed, killing 5", "title": "Friends identify pilot of Erie plane that crashed, killing 5", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/09/01/friends-identify-pilot-of-erie-plane-that-crashed-killing-5/", "image": {"width": 480, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140901__USPlaneCrashColorado2.jpg", "height": 337}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140901__USPlaneCrashColorado2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-01T11:07:33+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T08:40:56+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd10b9\"", "article_summary": "Frascona trained hundreds of real estate brokers in the Denver metro area on real estate law, colleagues said.\nFriends and associates Monday mourned the pilot of a plane that crashed and killed five people Sunday, a well-known Erie attorney who specialized in real estate law.\nThe plane is registered to The Real Estate School LLC and Frascona is the registered agent of the plane, a Piper PA-46.\nThe plane, which crashed upside down, had departed from Centennial Airport and was headed for the Erie Municipal Airport when it crashed in a field near a residential neighborhood, authorities said Sunday.\nFrascona was a partner in the well-established Boulder firm of Frascona, Joiner, Goodman and Greenstein P.C."}
