He headed back to a place where he has addressed the issue before.\n\nPRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Today, we\u2019re doing something about it.\n\n(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: The president chose Del Sol High School in Las Vegas for his forum. It\u2019s where he opened a drive last year for overhauling the immigration system.\n\nBARACK OBAMA: And what we have to do is be honest that tracking down, rounding up and deporting millions of people is not realistic. That\u2019s not who we are.\n\nMost undocumented immigrants are good, decent people. They have been here for a long time.\n\n(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: The executive orders will shield nearly five million Immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally from being deported. Some four million of those have been here for at least five years and have children who were born here and are already U.S. citizens. Another 300,000 will be protected by expanding a 2012 directive covering younger immigrants. Instead, the focus of deportation efforts will shift to criminals and those who\u2019ve entered the U.S. recently.\n\nRepublicans insisted again today that the president has gone too far. House Speaker John Boehner charged, Mr. Obama is damaging the presidency.\n\nREP. JOHN BOEHNER, Speaker of the House: We will not stand idle as the president undermines the rule of law in our country and places lives at risk. We will listen to the American people, we will work with our members, and we will work to protect the Constitution of the United States.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Boehner gave no specifics on what steps Republicans might take.\n\nSHERIFF JOE ARPAIO, Maricopa County, Arizona: We are filing the lawsuit.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: But an Arizona sheriff, Joe Arpaio, told a Phoenix TV station last night that he\u2019s challenging the president\u2019s action in court. He\u2019s taken a tough line on immigration and been accused of racial profiling.\n\nJOE ARPAIO: We have to understand whether this is constitutional or not, whether his going around Congress is legal. But I\u2019m going to send a message, send a message that we\u2019re not going to give up.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Several Republican governors have voiced support for legal action as well, including Wisconsin\u2019s Scott Walker, North Carolina\u2019s Pat McCrory, and Texas Governor Rick Perry.\n\nWe will return to the immigration issue and reaction from some of those affected after the news summary.\n\nOn another front, Republicans in the House of Representatives sued over President Obama\u2019s health care law. The lawsuit charges he overstepped his legal authority in implementing the Affordable Care Act. That\u2019s based in part on the administration\u2019s decision to delay requiring employers to provide coverage for workers.\n\nThe death toll rose to at least 13 today from the snowstorm that blasted parts of Western New York State. The Buffalo area was buried this week under seven feet of snow, and there may be worse to come; the region is now bracing for a weekend warmup and rain that could trigger flooding.\n\nMayor Byron Brown said today they\u2019re racing to clear the snow before it starts to melt.\n\nMAYOR BYRON BROWN, Buffalo: We now have over 220 pieces of snow removal equipment in South Buffalo working as we speak, city crews, state crews, National Guard and private contractors that are all working. We have 1,600 trucks that have carted over 32,000 tons of snow out of South Buffalo.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Already, there\u2019ve been more than 30 major roof collapses from the weight of the snow.\n\nIt\u2019s been almost two years since 20-year-old Adam Lanza shot 20 young children and six teachers to death at a school in Newtown, Connecticut. Now a state report finds the school system, in effect, let Lanza\u2019s parents \u2014 quote \u2014 \u201caccommodate and appease him over the years,\u201d rather than directing him toward the serious mental health treatment he needed. The report also pointed to the easy availability of assault weapons, which it called a critical public health issue in the U.S.\n\nLanza killed his mother, then attacked Sandy Hook Elementary School on December 14, 2012, before killing himself.\n\nAttorney General Eric Holder called for police restraint today as a grand jury in Ferguson, Missouri, readies its decision in the death of Michael Brown. The panel is considering whether to indict a white police officer for killing the unarmed black teenager. There\u2019ve been fears that the decision could spark new unrest. Holder posted a video statement today without mentioning Ferguson directly.\n\nERIC HOLDER, Attorney General: The Justice Department employs law enforcement officials in every jurisdiction to work with the communities that they serve to minimize needless confrontation. It is vital to engage in planning and preparation, from evaluating protocols and training to choosing the appropriate equipment and uniforms.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: The attorney general also said the most successful protest movements have been those that are nonviolent.\n\nThe Japanese government has ordered Takata Corporation to begin an internal investigation into its air bag problems. The bags can inflate with so much force, they rupture and spew out bits of metal. That\u2019s already prompted recalls of eight million vehicles. Japan\u2019s Transport Ministry said today that it wants Takata to study whether more recalls are needed, both in Japan and the U.S.\n\nWorries about slowing growth prompted China\u2019s Central Bank today to make a surprise cut in interest rates. It was the first such move in more than two years. Growth in the world\u2019s number-two economy has hit a five-year low of 7.3 percent.\n\nThe news from China went down well on Wall Street. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 91 points to close at 17810. The Nasdaq rose 11 points to close just below 4713. And the S&P 500 added 10 to finish at 2063. For the week, the Dow and the S&P gained 1 percent, the Nasdaq rose 0.5 percent.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In our news wrap Friday, the city of Buffalo, New York, braced for warming temperatures, rain and potential flooding after being buried by a storm that dumped up to 7 feet of snow.
