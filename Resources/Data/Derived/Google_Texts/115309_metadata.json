That\u2019s been cut to 6.7 percent. But most of those newly insured are not getting their insurance on the state\u2019s health exchange, Connect for Health Colorado, but through Medicaid.\n\nApproximately 450,000 more people have signed up in the last two years alone, bringing the number of Medicaid recipients in Colorado to 1.2 million. That makes Colorado one of the fastest growing Medicaid populations in the country.\n\nThe Colorado Health Institute, which conducted the survey, calls it a new day in Colorado with the uninsured population now at a historic low.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve spent so much money on Obamacare that I would hope some additional people had insurance. Unfortunately the figures suggest that they aren\u2019t getting insurance, they\u2019re getting Medicaid,\u201d said Linda Gorman with the Republican leaning Independence Institute.\n\nGorman says Obamacare is not doing what it promised to do. The survey found no net growth in people getting insurance on the individual market, and of those that did, only 40 percent bought it on the exchange set up by the state.\n\nOne in three Coloradans now have some type of government insurance with many of them being children. The number of children who are uninsured dropped from 7 percent two years ago to just 2.5 percent.\n\nMore people 19 to 29 years old are also getting insurance, although they remain among the highest number of uninsured at 13 percent.\n\nCost still is the biggest barrier, but the number of people filing for bankruptcy because of medical bills dropped from 104,000 in 2013 to 45,000 in 2015. Adam Fox with the Colorado Consumer Health Initiative \u2014 which supports Obamacare \u2014 says that\u2019s an indication it\u2019s protecting some of the most vulnerable.\n\n\u201cIt shows that people with coverage \u2014 while they may be delaying care, they may be facing cost-share problems, they\u2019re still protected from really high medical costs,\u201d Fox said.\n\nMedicaid says the average cost of care for a Medicaid recipient has dropped 6 percent over the last couple years. But the survey found more people are having trouble accessing care. The state Legislature increased some reimbursement rates to help. Medicaid says that\u2019s lead to a 14 percent increase in doctors accepting Medicaid.", "article_metadata": {"description": "More people than ever have health insurance in Colorado as a new survey found the uninsured rate in the state has dropped by more than half since the new federal health care law took effect.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://denver.cbslocal.com/2015/09/01/survey-colorado-one-of-the-fastest-growing-medicaid-populations-in-u-s/", "image": {"width": 1500, "secure_url": "https://cbsdenver.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/57260724-1.jpg?w=1500", "identifier": "https://cbsdenver.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/57260724-1.jpg?w=1500", "height": 844}, "type": "article", "description": "More people than ever have health insurance in Colorado as a new survey found the uninsured rate in the state has dropped by more than half since the new federal health care law took effect.", "title": "Survey: Colorado One Of The Fastest Growing Medicaid Populations In U.S."}, "twitter": {"site": "/social/", "image": "https://cbsdenver.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/57260724-1.jpg?w=1500", "description": "More people than ever have health insurance in Colorado as a new survey found the uninsured rate in the state has dropped by more than half since the new federal health care law took effect.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Survey: Colorado One Of The Fastest Growing Medicaid Populations In U.S."}, "msapplication-tooltip": "CBSDenver.com in Denver is Colorado's Online News Channel with up to the minute breaking news, weather, sports and top spots.", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CBS Denver", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/cbsdenver", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/cbsdenver"}, "keywords": "health, links & info, local, news, shaun boyd, syndicated local, adam fox, colorado consumer health initiative, colorado health institute, connect for health colorado, health care, health insurance, independence institute, linda gorman, medicaid, obamacare", "google-site-verification": "44caXBf4kjHeKKAT7ZZ89NaCX25utL_yRSa-qGpwIhY", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://denver.cbslocal.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/1358cb67b88b4ef2e59895070c511d70?s=16", "news_keywords": "adam fox, colorado consumer health initiative, colorado health institute, connect for health colorado, health care, health insurance, independence institute, linda gorman, medicaid, obamacare"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3181\"", "article_summary": "Unfortunately the figures suggest that they aren\u2019t getting insurance, they\u2019re getting Medicaid,\u201d said Linda Gorman with the Republican leaning Independence Institute.\nBut most of those newly insured are not getting their insurance on the state\u2019s health exchange, Connect for Health Colorado, but through Medicaid.\nThat makes Colorado one of the fastest growing Medicaid populations in the country.\nThe Colorado Health Institute, which conducted the survey, calls it a new day in Colorado with the uninsured population now at a historic low.\nMedicaid says the average cost of care for a Medicaid recipient has dropped 6 percent over the last couple years."}
