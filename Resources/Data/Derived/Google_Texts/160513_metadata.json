Pretend that it\u2019s the spring of 1970. President Richard Nixon has just sent US troops into Cambodia. He thereby expands the Vietnam War, a costly undertaking already ongoing for years with no sign of victory in sight.\n\nNow imagine further that Nixon sends a message to Congress asking that it authorize him to do what he has already done (while simultaneously insisting that even without legislative approval he already has the necessary authority).\n\nThis essentially describes the present-day position of the Obama administration, requesting ex post facto congressional approval of the military campaign against the Islamic State that it launched several months ago.\n\nThe president emphasizes that the Cambodian operation is not really a big deal. He has no intention of US troops maintaining an \u201cenduring\u201d presence there. Even so, he\u2019d like Congress to approve a three-year grant of authority, not only to attack North Vietnamese sanctuaries in Cambodia, but also \u201cassociated persons or forces\u201d aiding the North Vietnamese or \u201cany closely-related successor entity\u201d posing a threat to the United States.\n\nThis essentially describes the present-day position of the Obama administration, requesting ex post facto congressional approval of the military campaign against the Islamic State that it launched several months ago.\n\nNow, let\u2019s take the thought experiment one step further. Imagine that Congress takes up Nixon\u2019s request and debates whether or not to give its consent to what he has already done. What would be the tenor of that debate? Would members of Congress confine their inquiry to the specific question Nixon had posed: Whether or not to okay the Cambodian invasion? Or would the Cambodian issue open the door to a more searching examination of the premises and conduct of the Vietnam War and indeed of the Cold War itself?\n\nWe can\u2019t know, of course, but it seems likely that members of Congress would have seized the opportunity to look beyond the matter immediately at hand. In all likelihood, a debate over whether or not to give Nixon the go-ahead in Cambodia would have become a debate about the several decades of policy decisions that had culminated in the Cambodian invasion.\n\nHow did we arrive at this predicament? Where exactly are we headed? What is the overall aim? How will we know when we have succeeded? What further costs will the perpetuation of the enterprise entail?\n\nBack in 1970, when the predicament was the Vietnam War, those questions demanded urgent attention. Today, the enterprise once known as the Global War on Terrorism, now informally referred to as the Long War or the Forever War or (my personal preference) America\u2019s War for the Greater Middle East, defines our predicament. But the questions remain the same as they were when Cambodia rather than the Islamic State represented the issue of the moment.\n\nSo President Obama\u2019s requested Authorization for the Use of Military Force (AUMF) could not have come at a more propitious moment. The proposed AUMF presents the Congress with an extraordinary opportunity \u2014 not to rubber stamp actions already taken, but to take stock of an undertaking that already exceeds the Vietnam War in length while showing not the slightest sign of ending in success.\n\nAndrew Bacevich on How Our National Security Agencies Are Failing Us\n\nThe US military effort to stabilize or pacify or dominate or democratize the Greater Middle East has failed irrevocably. Trying harder, whether with air strikes or special operations raids or even \u201cenduring offensive ground combat operations,\u201d will not yield a different result.\n\nThe people await the appearance of political leaders who can summon up the courage to acknowledge that failure and to initiate the long overdue discussion of how to chart a different course.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Military historian Andrew Bacevich says it's time for lawmakers to take the long view of our military campaign in the Middle East.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "BillMoyers.com", "description": "Military historian Andrew Bacevich says it's time for lawmakers to take the long view of our military campaign in the Middle East.", "title": "Obama's ISIS War Request Is an \"Extraordinary Opportunity\" for Congress | BillMoyers.com", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://dy00k1db5oznd.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/AP710954665973.jpg", "height": 360}, "updated_time": "2015-05-23T15:58:46-04:00", "url": "http://billmoyers.com/2015/02/14/asking-right-questions/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Military historian Andrew Bacevich says it's time for lawmakers to take the long view of our military campaign in the Middle East.", "creator": "@BillMoyersHQ", "image": "http://dy00k1db5oznd.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/AP710954665973.jpg", "title": "Obama's ISIS War Request Is an \"Extraordinary Opportunity\" for Congress | BillMoyers.com", "site": "@BillMoyersHQ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "article": {"section": "Blog", "tag": "widget", "published_time": "2015-02-14T10:25:51-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-23T15:58:46-04:00"}, "pubdate": 20150214, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "He thereby expands the Vietnam War, a costly undertaking already ongoing for years with no sign of victory in sight.\nBack in 1970, when the predicament was the Vietnam War, those questions demanded urgent attention.\nOr would the Cambodian issue open the door to a more searching examination of the premises and conduct of the Vietnam War and indeed of the Cold War itself?\nImagine that Congress takes up Nixon\u2019s request and debates whether or not to give its consent to what he has already done.\nThe proposed AUMF presents the Congress with an extraordinary opportunity \u2014 not to rubber stamp actions already taken, but to take stock of an undertaking that already exceeds the Vietnam War in length while showing not the slightest sign of ending in success."}
