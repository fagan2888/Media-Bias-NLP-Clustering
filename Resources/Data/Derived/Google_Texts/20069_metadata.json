Barack Obama is playing a very different game from that played by any top American politician in decades \u2014 and maybe ever.

Never let up.\u201d Keep the opposition off balance. Attack from all sides, never letting the opponents catch their breath or regroup.\n\nTo study Obama is to understand these tendencies. That\u2019s how it was predictable, the day after Obama was first elected, that the Left would find a way to finagle a filibuster-proof Senate majority in early 2009, eventually nuke the filibuster itself, work against all ballot-integrity measures, charge abortion protesters with civil-rights violations, drum up street demonstrations and civil unrest (the Occupy movement), and use the IRS to harass and audit conservative organizations.\n\nThat\u2019s why it is so important, first, to not assume Obama is a political goner, and second, to take control of the narrative so that Obama won\u2019t be able to get back on the offensive.
