Alcohol appears to be a factor in a single-car crash into a pole that claimed the life of a 25-year-old woman early Sunday morning, according to the Tucson Police Department.

The woman, 25-year-old Amy Galarza, was driving a 2009 Nissan Altima westbound on East Grant Road just before 2:30 a.m. when, according to investigators, she apparently veered to the right. Investigators believe she began in the median lane and ended up crossing over the curb lane, hitting a raised curb and then a street light pole near North Estrella Avenue, just east of North Stone Avenue.

The Tucson Fire Department transported Galarza with life-threatening injuries to Banner University Medical Center, where she later died.

Police do not believe speed was a factor in the crash. Next of kin has been notified.
