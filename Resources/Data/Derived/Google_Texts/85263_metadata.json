One of these systems is carefully regulated. It benefits from substantial government subsidies, and it offers extensive protections to consumers.\n\nThe other system serves the poor.\n\n\u201cOne of the great ironies in American life is that the less money you have, the more you have to pay to use it,\u201d writes Mehrsa Baradaran at the beginning of her new book, \u201cHow the Other Half Banks.\u201d Baradaran, a law professor at the University of Georgia, is keying in on a deep social inequity: for millions of Americans, the main options for basic banking services are payday lenders and check cashers. These services charge exorbitant rates and fees. In many states, they\u2019re barely regulated. They form an exploitative shadow market to the brick-and-mortar, federally-subsidized-and-guaranteed banks that serve more affluent Americans.\n\nBaradaran is unconvinced that the private sector can offer good banking services to low-income Americans. Other than Wal-Mart, few companies are even trying. In \u201cHow the Other Half Banks,\u201d Baradaran looks for another option \u2014 ideally, an institution with a national network of locations already in place and a commitment to public service.\n\nIf only we had an institution like that! And, of course, we do: the United States Postal Service. The idea isn\u2019t outlandish: a number of countries have postal banks. The United States did, too, from 1911-1967. The Postal Service itself has suggested this idea, in a 2014 white paper, and Bernie Sanders expressed support for postal banking in a recent interview. The Postal Service could offer low-cost checking services, and perhaps even affordable loans.\n\nBank access is a social issue that rarely gets attention in national policy debates. Baradaran is trying to change that. Over the phone, she spoke with Salon about post office lines, bank bailouts and why banking services are a bit like healthcare.\n\nIf we were to ask Bank of America executives why they don\u2019t serve a huge chunk of America, how would they explain it?\n\nIt\u2019s just not their model. It\u2019s incredibly expensive to service a small deposit. They would say, \u201cLook, it\u2019s not profitable for us, and we would lose money if we went after these deposits.\u201d\n\nWhat about community banks?\n\nThey have the very same profitability problem as Bank of America. They\u2019ve followed the big banks out of these areas into higher profits, which are big loans, syndicates, huge commercial loans. The deposit area is just not a profitable business anymore, especially small deposits and small loans.\n\nStill, it\u2019s possible to open a small account at most banks. What holds so many people back?\n\nFees have a way of repelling small depositors, which I think is mainly the point. You put $100 in a bank, and you have to keep drawing it out, and you get a $35 dollar fee every time it goes below a certain number.\n\nSo, one, it\u2019s a rational decision, if you have small deposits or volatile deposits. Two, there are substantial cultural barriers. Banks for years have had these marble buildings. That\u2019s a real sort of class barrier \u2014 purposely so.\n\nA lot of people speak a different language and don\u2019t feel comfortable in the bank. A lot of banks are open 9 to 5, and low-income folks work during those hours, and they need to come in later. Payday lenders, on the other hand, are in their neighborhoods. They\u2019re open all night. They speak their language. They have this informality, [even though] they\u2019re huge, publicly traded, very profitable organizations.\n\nAre there designers sitting at Bank of America or Citibank, thinking \u201cHow can we push away small depositors?\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s quite that sinister. But when a business does not want a certain customer, they will repel that customer.\n\nWhat does Walmart do when you overdraw on a Wal-Mart account? They just freeze it. They don\u2019t charge you that $35, $45 fee. Now, Bank of America does do that. They could freeze it. But they don\u2019t; they charge the fee. Why? I think it\u2019s used as a repellent for the small accounts, whether they\u2019re going to say it or not.\n\nHow do payday lenders and check cashers justify their exorbitant fees?\n\nOne argument that a lot of payday lenders use is that this is the market price. They\u2019re taking a risk by lending to people who are low income, and the way lenders fight that risk is by high interest.\n\nBut for a market price, you would see a competition on price with these payday lenders. You just don\u2019t see that. Payday lenders will lend to you at the absolute maximum interest rate allowed by law per state. People aren\u2019t shopping around; they\u2019ve exhausted their friends and family, credit cards or whatever. They go to the payday lender as a lender of last resort. They would borrow at almost any price.\n\nAs for the check cashers, why are they taking 10% off these checks? These are virtually risk-free. A lot of them are Social Security or military checks. The federal government isn\u2019t going to default on their obligation to pay these checks. Now, [check cashers] do have to pay for the storefront, they have to pay for their personnel. It is the cost of doing business, certainly.\n\nCan we do it better? Can we do it by not making the poor pay for things that the rich just get for free?\n\nThis reminds me of the debate over healthcare. Some people argue that healthcare works like a free market, and should be treated as such. The rebuttal is that when you\u2019re dying or in terrible pain, you\u2019re going to pay anything. It\u2019s not like buying a car.\n\nWe talk about banks being short on cash \u2014 illiquid. They have more liabilities than they have assets. The Federal Reserve gives money to banks that are just illiquid. When [these banks] have a cash crunch, they just need to pay out and they\u2019ll make it.\n\nPeople, I think, can be seen the same way. A lot of people are just illiquid. They\u2019ve got a cash crunch. I have to pay $500 to fix my car, and I\u2019m good for it: if I can get my car, I can go back to work, I can make the money. But quickly that illiquidity can turn into bankruptcy. If I don\u2019t get the $500, I have no income. But, if I get that $500, and it costs me $1,500 to pay down that $500 [loan], I\u2019m all of a sudden bankrupt.\n\nBanks are the same way. You just have a cash crunch: if you have a bunch of depositors coming in your door, that\u2019s a run. I can either get that money quickly as a loan, pay them out, and be safe \u2014 or my bank goes under. We help those banks out. But with people who are financially dying, we say, \u201cTough. You should have been less stupid and made more money.\u201d Whatever the cultural judgements are that we put on people with debt, we put it out harsher for the poor.", "article_metadata": {"description": "They get the bailouts.
