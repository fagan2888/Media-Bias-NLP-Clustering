Mitch McConnell suggested in a low-drama interview with Politico.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nMcConnell offered nothing to the party\u2019s populist base, except finger-wagging. The pro-life push to transfer funding away from abortion-giant Planned Parenthood \u201cis an exercise in futility\u2026 that\u2019s not going to happen until you have a president who has a similar view,\u201d he said.\n\nMcConnell didn\u2019t offer any opposition to President Barack Obama\u2019s effort to amnesty millions of illegal immigrants, or his promise to bring in at least 10,000 Muslim refugees from Syria late this year. The amnesty issue split the party from November 2014 to March 2015, and has since boosted Donald Trump to the front of the GOP\u2019s 2016 race.\n\nInstead, McConnell touted wins compatible with business\u2019 goals. \u201cThis is a critical election, in my view, about whether we want to continue to go down this European path, or whether we want to recapture the growth rates and the greatness we\u2019ve had most of our history,\u201d McConnell said. Obama is imposing \u201cmassive debt, high taxes on the most successful people, over-regulation.\u201d\n\nInstead of voting to transfer $500 million in funding away from abortion giant Planned Parenthood, he touted a bill that would curb abortions after 20 weeks \u2014 but didn\u2019t suggest any tactics or strategy to ensure it is accepted by Democrats or Barack Obama. \u201cWhat we are going to do is move to the pain-capable [20-week abortion] bill sometime this month and see how people feel about that,\u201d he said.\n\nBut McConnell is following his usual strategy of delaying hard debate until he can fold his cards once President Barack Obama threatens to shutdown the federal agencies, said a Hill staffer. If McConnell wanted to win, he should start a debate early to pressure the Democrats into conceding, the aide said.\n\nMcConnell\u2019s attitude, the aide said, is \u201cGod forbid we fight on it, let\u2019s just completely capitulate on it from the get-go.\u201d\n\nIn general, McConnell \u201dwon\u2019t bring anything to floor unless he knows for certain that Obama won\u2019t veto it,\u201d the aide said, adding \u201cWhat was the point of electing Republicans to the majority?\u201d\n\nYet McConnell will fight for his business donors, the aide said. \u201cThey fight against conservative goals, they fight in favor of Washington\u2019s business lobbies and for the D.C. cartel at the expense of Americans,\u201d the aide said.\n\nIn June, McConnell passed the fast-track trade law, which allows future free-trade bills to bypass much public opposition. He was aided by House Speaker John Boehner, who was initially defeated by a bipartisan majority in the House. But Obama, Boehner, McConnell, plus most GOP and Democrat Senators and most business groups, stuck together and passed the fast-track law.\n\nMcConnell\u2019s pro-business strategy is driven in large part by his bet that business donations \u2014 not a populist strategy \u2014 will help him reelect nearly all of the 24 GOP Senators who must face the votes in November 2016. Only 10 Democratic Senators are up for election. McConnell is mostly playing defense, but is hoping to gain seats in Nevada and Colorado.\n\nMcConnell is also trying to protect GOP Senators from casting conservative votes that might annoy swing-voters next November.\n\nIn his Politico interview, McConnell said nothing about the issue that has split the GOP and turned the 2016 race inside-out \u2014 public opposition to massive annual inflow of roughly two million legal and illegal foreign workers into the U.S. labor market, alongside the annual arrival of four million American youths.\n\nIn fact, McConnell pushed business\u2019 talking-points about a supposed labor shortage even though the low-wage economy has a workforce participation rate which has dropped back to the level of the 1970s. Companies supposedly have \u201ca hard time finding people to do the work because they\u2019re doing too good with food stamps, Social Security and all the rest,\u201d he claimed.\n\nIn fact, fewer American women had jobs in August 2015 than had jobs in December 2007.\n\nUntil a new president is elected, McConnell is aiming to win small-ball fights on cybersecurity and a chemicals regulation bill.\n\nBut he\u2019s also likely going to join hands with Obama to pass business-backed free-trade bills in 2016 that will force blue-collar American workers to compete directly with huge numbers of very low-wage Asian workers, and also allow companies to import huge numbers of foreign white-collar professionals for American-based jobs done by American graduates.\n\nThere\u2019s also no evidence yet that McConnell will fight Obama\u2019s plans to import many more low-wage government-dependent Hispanic and Muslim migrants, despite the nation\u2019s high unemployment and underemployment rate.\n\nIn January, McConnell and his team cut deals with Obama that preserved funding for his planned amnesty in exchange for Democrats\u2019 support for a give-away to the GOP\u2019s Wall Street donors.\n\nDuring that November-to-March fight, McConnell\u2019s team did almost nothing to pressure Democrats into voting against Obama\u2019s amnesty, or to work with the public\u2019s strong opposition to his amnesty, which is supported by the GOP\u2019s donors.\n\nObama\u2019s amnesty, however, has been temporarily blocked by Texas courts.\n\nFollow Neil Munro on Twitter @NeilMunroDC", "article_metadata": {"description": "The GOP\u2019s populist base can help win big battles for the party\u2019s business donors in 2017, GOP leader Sen.
