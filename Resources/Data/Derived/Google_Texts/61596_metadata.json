Follow him on Twitter: @rubennavarrette. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.\n\n(CNN) The 2016 presidential race is just beginning. Yet we already can say this much: Despite a bump in the polls, and the fact that some conservatives consider him the prototype for successful leaders, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker would be a terrible choice for the GOP nomination.\n\nOf course, Republicans have made bad choices before. A recent Des Moines Register survey found Walker to be the first pick of 15% of the GOP faithful likely to attend the Iowa Caucus.\n\nSo why would Walker be a bad choice? Three reasons.\n\nThe world is a dangerous place. We can't afford another commander-in-chief with no foreign policy experience who doesn't understand America's role in the world. As the governor of Wisconsin -- as opposed to U.S. senator (Rand Paul, Marco Rubio or Ted Cruz) or a former U.N. ambassador (John Bolton) -- Walker's diplomatic experience is limited to settling disputes with Minnesota during football season. He would be learning on the job while rogue actors like ISIS, Iran, Russia and North Korea threaten Americans, create unrest and perpetuate acts of terror. There are times to look to the states and elect leaders who can focus the nation's attention on domestic priorities like the economy, and there are times to look for leaders with a firm handle on foreign policy because the stakes are too high to gamble on that front. Guess which era we're living in.\n\nBuilt-in enemies are extra baggage. Walker has repeatedly fought organized labor in Wisconsin -- over collective bargaining, an attempted recall, running for re-election -- and scored impressive victories. But Walker has also antagonized that special interest, which will spend tens of millions of dollars in the presidential election to settle the score. Unions might otherwise feel ambivalent about a Hillary Clinton candidacy, especially with the prospect of an insurgent campaign by Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who would likely embrace more firmly the divisive rhetoric about income equality that union members love to hear. If Walker is the GOP nominee, ambivalence will be trumped by anger. An activated and animated base of union supporters throwing money at the Democrats is a headache that Republicans don't need.\n\nRead More", "article_metadata": {"description": "The governor doesn't have the foreign policy credentials or the courage needed for today's era.", "pubdate": "2015-02-12T22:41:36Z", "author": "Ruben Navarrette, CNN Contributor", "og": {"site_name": "CNN", "description": "The governor doesn't have the foreign policy credentials or the courage needed for today's era.", "pubdate": "2015-02-12T22:41:36Z", "title": "Is Scott Walker qualified to be president?", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2015/02/12/opinion/navarrette-scott-walker-unqualified/index.html", "image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150203124942-scott-walker-press-large-169.jpg", "type": "article"}, "section": "opinion", "fb": {"app_id": 80401312489}, "thumbnail": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150203124942-scott-walker-press-large-169.jpg", "template-top": "opinion,art-gal", "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.cnn.com/2015/02/12/opinion/navarrette-scott-walker-unqualified/index.html"}, "keywords": "opinion, Is Scott Walker qualified to be president? - CNN.com", "lastmod": "2015-02-12T23:46:48Z", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda832\"", "article_summary": "Story highlights Navarrette: Walker doesn't have the foreign policy credentials or the courage needed for today's era.\nYet we already can say this much: Despite a bump in the polls, and the fact that some conservatives consider him the prototype for successful leaders, Wisconsin Gov.\nScott Walker would be a terrible choice for the GOP nomination.\nWe can't afford another commander-in-chief with no foreign policy experience who doesn't understand America's role in the world.\nWalker has repeatedly fought organized labor in Wisconsin -- over collective bargaining, an attempted recall, running for re-election -- and scored impressive victories."}
