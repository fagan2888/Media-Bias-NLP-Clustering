They have basically become the PR firm for the EPA,\u201d said Thomas Pyle, president of the conservative Institute for Energy Research. \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating because the organization\u2019s mission, its stated mission, is pure. But I think they\u2019ve certainly lost their way. I think they\u2019ve gone beyond that.\u201d\n\nIn addition to its broader environmental agenda, the organization also has come under fire from state regulators who charge the group has manipulated clean-air data in an effort to scare Americans into supporting even harsher pollution controls.\n\nAside from specific questions about ALA\u2019s presentation of air-quality information across the nation, there\u2019s little doubt the group has become politically divisive. While also becoming a public face for Mr. Obama\u2019s efforts to restrict carbon pollution from power plants, tighten the federal ozone standard and take other high-profile steps, the ALA has gone beyond words and has allied itself with the White House and environmental activists in the legal realm.\n\nLast week the ALA said it would \u201cformally intervene to legally defend the Clean Power Plan,\u201d an EPA proposal designed to limit carbon pollution from power plants and shrink U.S. coal use. A coalition of states, along with major energy companies, has challenged the regulations in federal court.\n\nThe ALA has been a full-throated supporter of the plan throughout the EPA\u2019s lengthy rule-making process, which led up to the proposal\u2019s formal release earlier this year. The ALA also has run advertising campaigns in support of specific aspects of Mr. Obama\u2019s environmental push, including the harsher ozone standards.\n\nSome of the organization\u2019s leaders say those moves are just the latest examples of ALA recognizing that Mr. Obama\u2019s tenure represents the best chance to implement strong climate change policies and, in the process, they argue, reduce asthma cases and other health threats.\n\n\u201cThe body of research has grown significantly over the last few years, showing some of the respiratory impacts of climate change. So over the last six or seven years, we\u2019ve become more engaged in these topics and really increased our engagement as the policy opportunities\u201d have arisen, said Paul Billings, senior vice president of advocacy and education with the ALA.\n\nHe went on to deny claims that the group has become a partisan weapon, a charge increasingly leveled at the ALA by top lawmakers on Capitol Hill and other opponents of Mr. Obama\u2019s climate strategy.\n\n\u201cThe [American] Lung Association has a 50-year history of working on air pollution issues we\u2019re strictly nonpartisan. We\u2019ve worked with Democrats and Republicans in Congress.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the ALA worked closely with lawmakers in both parties to enact key changes in policy, including the landmark 1990 amendments to the federal Clean Air Act.\n\nIn recent years, however, the ALA has actively attacked Republicans who oppose Mr. Obama\u2019s environmental plans. In February 2012, for example, the group specifically blasted Sen. James M. Inhofe, Oklahoma Republican and chairman of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, for pushing legislation to block the EPA\u2019s mercury and air toxic standards.\n\nThose standards were tossed by the Supreme Court earlier this year.\n\nThe ALA\u2019s evolving mission also has coincided with a drop in its fundraising, according to IRS records.\n\nIn 2009, for example, the organization\u2019s financial forms show $18 million in \u201cgifts, grants, contributions and membership fees.\u201d In 2013 that figure shrunk to $6 million, records show.\n\nAmid that drop, the ALA\u2019s battles with Mr. Inhofe and other top lawmakers on Capitol Hill have intensified.\n\nMr. Inhofe argues the ALA has joined the ranks of the Sierra Club, the Natural Resources Defense Council and other groups that have enjoyed unprecedented access to, and wield significant influence over, administration officials directly responsible for environmental policy, including those at the highest levels of the EPA.\n\n\u201cClose coordination between the EPA and ALA is nothing new ALA has worked hand-in-hand with EPA to issue some of the most far-reaching regulations,\u201d Mr. Inhofe said in a statement. \u201cDespite promises of an open and public regulatory process, the Obama-EPA has ushered in an era of outsized access to environmental allies like the ALA.\u201d\n\nMr. Billings denied that the ALA has more access to the administration than any other group, including oil-and-gas industry organizations.\n\nAt the state level the ALA routinely releases an annual \u201creport card\u201d on air quality. This year\u2019s Colorado report, for example, said the state\u2019s air is getting worse in many areas despite state figures that seem to show the opposite.\n\nColorado state officials publicly rebuked the ALA study, saying the organization\u2019s claims about rising ozone levels in and around Denver were \u201cinaccurate\u201d and a misrepresentation of the facts.\n\nALA critics say the Colorado scuffle is indicative of a broader problem. They warn that similar actions in the future could do irreparable harm to the ALA\u2019s brand name.\n\n\u201cFrom the ALA\u2019s perspective, it\u2019s a very dicey undertaking, to say the least,\u201d said Raymond Keating, chief economist for the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Council. \u201cWhen you look at what they\u2019ve produced and some of the things they throw around \u2014 air quality with the ozone issue \u2014 you\u2019ve got to scratch your head a little bit.\u201d\n\nFor its part, the ALA says it\u2019s not surprised state regulators disagree with its clean-air findings. Mr. Billings argues one of the organization\u2019s key roles is to push states to go further in cleaning up the air.\n\n\u201cGetting cleaner is not clean enough,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fact that some regulators in some states disagree with the grades we put forward is not news. We also are there working [with] states, with the EPA and with local communities to put in place the best set of pollution controls [possible]. I\u2019m proud of our report, and I stand by it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The American Lung Association -- formerly best known for its highly successful antismoking initiatives -- in recent years has undergone a dramatic transformation and now lends its respected voice and identifiable brand to President Obama's climate change agenda, often acting in lockstep with environmental activists and liberals on Capitol Hill.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The American Lung Association \u2014 formerly best known for its highly successful antismoking initiatives \u2014 in recent years has undergone a dramatic transformation and now lends its respected voice and identifiable brand to President Obama\u2019s climate change agenda, often acting in lockstep with environmental activists and liberals on Capitol Hill.", "title": "American Lung Association pushes Obama climate change agenda", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/oct/28/american-lung-association-pushes-obama-climate-cha/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/10/28/Obama.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/10/28/Obama.jpg", "description": "The American Lung Association -- formerly best known for its highly successful antismoking initiatives -- in recent years has undergone a dramatic transformation and now lends its respected voice and", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "American Lung Association pushes Obama climate change agenda"}, "Author": "Ben Wolfgang", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Environment, Barack Obama, American Lung Association, Environmental Protection Agency"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc090\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe [American] Lung Association has a 50-year history of working on air pollution issues we\u2019re strictly nonpartisan.\nThe ALA also has run advertising campaigns in support of specific aspects of Mr. Obama\u2019s environmental push, including the harsher ozone standards.\nIn recent years, however, the ALA has actively attacked Republicans who oppose Mr. Obama\u2019s environmental plans.\nThis year\u2019s Colorado report, for example, said the state\u2019s air is getting worse in many areas despite state figures that seem to show the opposite.\n\u201cThe body of research has grown significantly over the last few years, showing some of the respiratory impacts of climate change."}
