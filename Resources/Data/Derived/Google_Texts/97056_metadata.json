Survey results indicate that in 2015, fewer nonprofits understand Affordable Care Act (ACA) requirements, and nearly half consider ACA compliance to be \u201cvery challenging\u201d. Furthermore, a majority of surveyed nonprofits has not calculated the cost of compliance.\n\nIn 2014, 92% of surveyed nonprofits felt they had at least a moderate understanding of the law; in 2015 that number fell to 47%. In 2014, 18% of employers felt that they were extremely knowledgeable of the ACA; only 5% made that claim in 2015. Furthermore, 56% of surveyed nonprofits have not calculated the cost of compliance with the ACA, and 45% consider ACA implementation very challenging when providing employee benefits.\n\n\u201cWe see these struggles across our entire business; it is not necessarily unique to the nonprofit sector,\u201d said Karen Greco, Director of Marketing for PPI Benefit Solutions. \u201cSmaller, mid-sized employers are relying heavily on their brokers and administrators to bring clarity around certain aspects of the law, what does or does not apply, and what tools are available to help them meet their requirements.\u201d\n\nAlthough few nonprofit organizations plan to eliminate healthcare benefits or reduce their premium contributions as a direct result of the ACA, they continue to seek savings through plan design or decreasing dependent contributions, thus shifting more cost onto employees. This trend is reflected among 2015 survey results: 56% of surveyed nonprofits now offer a Health Savings Account (HSA). This is up from only 12% in 2014, and proves that consumer directed health plans (CDHPs) continue to gain momentum throughout the nonprofit sector. As a trade-off for lower premiums, HSA-compatible plans feature high deductibles, forcing consumers to become better managers of their healthcare dollars. To help offset these high deductibles, more employers are offering group voluntary products that feature premiums typically lower than their individual product counterparts and help fill the gaps in healthcare coverage until deductibles are met.\n\n\u201cVoluntary products can also be a great option for employers who might otherwise discontinue a particular benefit, such as dental or vision.\u201d says Greco.\n\nAs the healthcare marketplace continues to evolve, nearly 100% of nonprofit employers remain committed to delivering health and welfare benefits to employees in order to improve job satisfaction and maintain a competitive advantage for talent.\n\nThe findings of the PPI 2015 Nonprofit Employee Benefits Survey also include plan benchmarks that can help nonprofit employers compare their own offerings with others throughout the nonprofit sector. These benchmarks include statistics on enrollment methods, average payroll deductions, eligibility, waiting periods, and contribution strategies, among others.\n\nPPI Benefit Solutions has compiled these findings into a free report, which is available at ppibenefits.com/survey.

A total of 299 responses were received, representing a 16% increase over last year\u2019s participation. The majority of responses were submitted by human resources professionals at mid-sized private nonprofits located in northeastern United States.\n\nAbout PPI Benefit Solutions\n\nPPI Benefit Solutions helps smaller, mid-sized employers relieve the day-to-day challenges of managing an employee benefits program.
