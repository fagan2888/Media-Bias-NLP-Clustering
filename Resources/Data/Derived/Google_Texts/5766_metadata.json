Naturally, it strikes me as a very impressive and encouraging speech. But I think I would say that even if I were less inclined to agree with its policy specifics, because purely as a rhetorical matter, it does something that Mitt Romney didn\u2019t manage to do in 2012 until, well, basically the first presidential debate: That is, it tries to meet non-conservative voters where they are and talk about the issues that they say they care about, rather than lecturing them on what they should be concerned about (too few people are paying income tax! Obama doesn\u2019t like entrepreneurs!) and assuming that they\u2019re already persuaded. It\u2019s a speech rooted in conservative principle without being trapped by the conservative talking points, in other words, and that\u2019s something we saw very little of in the 2012 campaign.\n\nSo where Republicans are inclined to disagree with some of Rubio\u2019s proposals, I would join my friend Reihan Salam in suggesting that they should treat his speech as an opportunity to demand that other would-be leaders (a Ted Cruz, a Scott Walker, whomever) step forward with alternatives \u2014 and just as importantly, explain how they \u201cexpect to secure a durable majority\u201d in their favor. The Republican Party in recent years has featured a great deal of non-substantive debate: The \u201912 primary season was full of it (excepting, of course, 9-9-9!), and the clashes in the House and Senate leading to the government shutdown over who really wants to repeal Obamacare and who\u2019s a sell-out squish followed a similar pattern, in which affect and tactics were often the main things up for dispute. But that does not have to be the case in the 2016 campaign: If the party\u2019s presidential contenders follow Rubio\u2019s example, the party could have an actual debate about what it believes should replace Obamacare (a universal tax credit, or something more limited, like what Bobby Jindal has proposed?), what the details of a potential tax reform should look like (the vigorous online debate over the child tax credit versus deeper top rate cuts belongs in an actual political campaign), how the safety net should actually work (as opposed to just vague promises to cap its growth), even how Social Security should be reformed (champions of private accounts, tell us why Rubio\u2019s proposals don\u2019t go far enough!). Of course it won\u2019t always be a high-minded debate \u2014 perish the thought! \u2014 but just having these kind of arguments would be immensely constructive, not only for the party, but for the country it aspires to govern.\n\nI would add one other other thought on the speech: I see that Rubio was attacked by Danny Vinik at The New Republic for being insufficiently wonky (because he hasn\u2019t specified pay-fors for all his education/safety net proposals) and by Laura Ingraham on Twitter for being insufficiently exciting (\u201cdare you to try to make it to end of speech w/out nodding off,\u201d she writes). As I\u2019ve said before regarding Rubio\u2019s proposals, the insufficient-specificity complaint strikes me as a bit ridiculous given that 1) he\u2019s the only 2016 contender offering anywhere close to this level of detail on policy at this point and 2) he\u2019s explicitly endorsed reforms to Medicare and Social Security that would have a much larger impact on the budget than any of his possible tweaks to education outlays. And Ingraham\u2019s insufficiently-exciting complaint sounds a lot like what critics of Bill Clinton always said about his speeches \u2014 so long, so much policy, surely voters won\u2019t like this. But they did, and they still do.\n\nWith that said, though, this is a pincer movement that a substantive G.O.P. campaign will have to cope with \u2014 parts of the base will find the approach insufficiently combative and exciting, while the liberal press will demand that every policy proposal meet a legislative, C.B.O.-ready standard that I don\u2019t precisely recall every Obama campaign promise reaching. So Rubio and any other Republican politician who follows his example will need to be prepared for it.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20140626125350, "twitter": {"description": "A senator\u2019s speech, and a step forward for his party.", "title": "Marco Rubio Raises the Bar", "url": "http://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/06/26/marco-rubio-raises-the-bar/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "site": "@DouthatNYT", "card": "summary"}, "sourceApp": "blogs", "blogpostid": 100000002965729, "DISPLAYDATE": "June 26, 2014", "article": {"published_time": 1403801630, "author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/rossdouthat/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "modified_time": "2014-06-26T16:55:39-04:00", "tag": "Uncategorized", "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp"}, "keywords": "Jindal Bobby,Romney Mitt,Rubio Marco,Conservatism (US Politics),Debates (Political),Income Tax,Presidential Election of 2012,Presidential Election of 2016,Tax Credits Deductions and Exemptions,Republican Party,YG Network,Uncategorized", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/douthat/Marco Rubio Raises the Bar ( 20140626 )", "PT": "Blogs", "SCG": "douthat", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/douthat", "per": "Jindal, Bobby;Romney, Mitt;Rubio, Marco", "BN": "douthat", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/douthat/post", "description": "A senator\u2019s speech, and a step forward for his party.", "CG": "Opinion", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "June 26, 2014", "org": "Republican Party;YG Network", "utime": 20140626165539, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20140626, "pdate": 20140626, "des": "Conservatism (US Politics);Debates (Political);Income Tax;Presidential Election of 2012;Presidential Election of 2016;Tax Credits, Deductions and Exemptions", "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "Ross Douthat", "description": "A senator\u2019s speech, and a step forward for his party.", "title": "Marco Rubio Raises the Bar", "url": "http://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/06/26/marco-rubio-raises-the-bar/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/06/26/marco-rubio-raises-the-bar/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "Marco Rubio Raises the Bar", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9803\"", "article_summary": "So Rubio and any other Republican politician who follows his example will need to be prepared for it.\nThe Republican Party in recent years has featured a great deal of non-substantive debate: The \u201912 primary season was full of it (excepting, of course, 9-9-9!\n\u2014 but just having these kind of arguments would be immensely constructive, not only for the party, but for the country it aspires to govern.\nNaturally, it strikes me as a very impressive and encouraging speech.\nOf course it won\u2019t always be a high-minded debate \u2014 perish the thought!"}
