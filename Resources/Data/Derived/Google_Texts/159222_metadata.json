It tries to pitch itself as synonymous with \u201cindependent.\u201d As in, if you\u2019re an \u201cindependent\u201d voter who\u2019s fed up with both the Republican and Democratic parties, as many are, you\u2019re a natural fit for libertarianism, a neutral collection area for those disenchanted with the two-party duopoly. Since a lot of people are fed up with the two-party duopoly, then, it would follow that libertarianism is growing and on the cusp of arriving as a viable national force. Nick Gillespie and Matt Welch, two editors at the libertarian magazine Reason, pitch libertarianism in this vein in their 2012 book \u201cDeclaration of Independents.\u201d And Welch, along with fellow libertarians Kennedy (the former MTV VJ) and Kmele Foster, host a show on the Fox Business Network called \u201cThe Independents.\u201d\n\nBut being an \u201cindependent\u201d or, someone who\u2019s looking for something other than the bundled packages that the Republicans and Democrats are selling, does not automatically make one a perfect candidate for libertarianism. That\u2019s because libertarianism isn\u2019t a void, it\u2019s an ideology that\u2019s selling its own bundle package. And some of its main components are far from what the disenchanted are looking to buy.\n\nWhy are we prattling on about the damn libertarians again? We apologize \u2014 but but but, um, the New York Times Magazine made us! With this week\u2019s big story, \u201cHas the \u2018Libertarian Moment\u2019 Finally Arrived?\u201d This appears to be the latest in the NYT Mag\u2019s recent series of credulous political cover stories, following the recent hit \u201cCan the G.O.P. Be a Party of Ideas?\u201d (Coming next: \u201cAre Social Conservatives Ascendant?\u201d \u201cIs Bobby Jindal the Next Reagan?\u201d \u201cWill New York City Become a Bastion of Conservatism?\u201d)\n\nThe argument for the \u201cLibertarian Moment\u201d at long last coming to save us from the scourge of the duopoly is something along the lines of this: Younger people are more socially liberal than previous generations but they also hate the stifling jackboot of the government and want the freedom to #disrupt existing economic paradigms with their apps and their Ubers and so forth. Throw in their suspicion of foreign intervention, and you have a generation perfectly molded for libertarianism:\n\nEmily Ekins, a pollster for the Reason Foundation, says: \u201cUnlike with previous generations, we\u2019re seeing a newer dimension emerge where they agree with Democrats on social issues, and on economic issues lean more to the right. It\u2019s possible that Democrats will have to shift to the right on economic issues. But the Republicans will definitely have to move to the left on social issues. They just don\u2019t have the numbers otherwise.\u201d A G.O.P. more flexible on social issues might also appeal to another traditionally Democratic group with a libertarian tilt: the high-tech communities in Silicon Valley and elsewhere, whose mounting disdain for taxes, regulations and unions has become increasingly dissonant with their voting habits.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Does disgust with Republicans and Democrats automatically mean Libertarians are the next hot thing?
