We would like to apologize to our readers and to all of those who were damaged by our story and the ensuing fallout, including members of the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity and UVA administrators and students.\u201d\n\nHowever, he spelled out no consequences for any staff members involved.\n\nRolling Stone publisher Jann S. Wenner told The New York Times on Sunday night that \u201cJackie\u201d was \u201ca really expert fabulist storyteller\u201d who manipulated the magazine\u2019s editorial process. He said he was not trying to move blame from the magazine to the source but added that \u201cobviously there is something here that is untruthful, and something sits at her doorstep.\u201d\n\nMs. Erdely also issued a written apology in which she described reading the Columbia Journalism Review report as a \u201cbrutal and humbling experience.\u201d\n\n\u201cReporting on rape has unique challenges, but the journalist still has the responsibility to get it right. I hope that my mistakes in reporting this story do not silence the voices of victims that need to be heard.\u201d\n\nConservatives responded to the Rolling Stone story early on with deep suspicion, and even in light of Ms. Erdely\u2019s apology, they were unforgiving.\n\n\u201cPerhaps Ms. Erdely will get the Pulitzer Prize for best fiction that she so richly deserves,\u201d one commenter wrote on the Wall Street Journal site. One commenter on Reason asked, \u201cWhere do the UVA fraternity members go to get their reputations back?\u201d\n\nIn March, the Phi Kappa Psi chapter said it was considering its legal options to deal with the \u201cextensive damage caused by Rolling Stone.\u201d\n\nThe Columbia Journalism Review released its report two weeks after Charlottesville Police Chief Timothy Longo said investigators were \u201cnot able to conclude, to any substantive degree, that an incident that is consistent with the facts contained in that article occurred at the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity house or any other fraternity house.\u201d\n\nIn a press conference last month, Chief Longo also said the purported rape victim had made previous, unverified reports of being attacked in the college town by other men and declined to provide a statement to detectives.\n\nHer account of being gang-raped at the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity house in 2012 was the substantive basis of the magazine\u2019s cover story.\n\nThe Rolling Stone article, \u201cA Rape on Campus,\u201d provided graphic details about a brutal attack by seven fraternity members. It sparked outrage at U.Va. and across the nation as evidence of a \u201crape culture\u201d on university campuses resulting from predatory fraternities and apathetic school officials.\n\nAlmost immediately after the story was published, the university temporarily suspended all of its fraternities, including Phi Kappa Psi, whose house was later vandalized and whose members received anonymous death threats.\n\nBut within days after the story was published in November, the magazine issued an online apology after follow-up reporting by Slate, The Washington Post and other media outlets could not corroborate details of Jackie\u2019s story. It also was learned that Ms. Erdely did not contact the accused men for fair comment.\n\nThree of Jackie\u2019s friends publicly denied Rolling Stone\u2019s account of how they discouraged the purported victim from reporting the assault, and her date from the night in question, a U.Va. student who she said lured her to an upstairs room in the fraternity house to be raped could not be found.\n\n\u201cIn the face of new information, there now appear to be discrepancies in Jackie\u2019s account,\u201d Mr. Dana said in a Dec. 5 online statement.\n\nThe magazine has since removed the story from its website.\n\nThe Washington Times reported in December that the three phone numbers Jackie told her friends belonged to the man who raped her were actually fake Internet numbers generated by a service that helps people veil their identities.\n\nThree days later, Ryan Duffin, the man Jackie first turned to about her gang rape and presumedly had a crush on, told the Daily Caller that it was \u201ca definite possibility\u201d that she had fabricated the rape claim to get his attention.\n\nOne of the more telling emails that Mr. Duffin received in October 2012, written by Jackie, turned out to be plagiarized from a 1998 script for the TV teen drama \u201cDawson\u2019s Creek.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you like someone more than he likes you, you\u2019ll do anything to switch the scales,\u201d she reportedly wrote.", "article_metadata": {"description": "There will be no repercussions for the investigative reporter or editors responsible for a now-retracted Rolling Stone cover story in November that falsely accused Phi Kappa Psi fraternity members at the University of Virginia of gang-raping a freshman coed.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "There will be no repercussions for the investigative reporter or editors responsible for a now-retracted Rolling Stone cover story in November that falsely accused Phi Kappa Psi fraternity members at the University of Virginia of gang-raping a freshman coed.", "title": "Rolling Stone U.Va. rape story yields no repercussions for reporter, editors", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/apr/5/rolling-stone-uva-rape-story-yields-no-repercussio/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/05/UVa.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/05/UVa.jpg", "description": "There will be no repercussions for the investigative reporter or editors responsible for a now-retracted Rolling Stone cover story in November that falsely accused Phi Kappa Psi fraternity members at", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Rolling Stone U.Va. rape story yields no repercussions for reporter, e"}, "Author": "Jeffrey Scott Shapiro", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Entertainment Culture, Rolling Stone, Sabrina Rubin Erdely, Jackie, Will Dana"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbced\"", "article_summary": "In a statement posted on the website, Rolling Stone Managing Editor Will Dana said the magazine was \u201cofficially retracting\u201d the story.\nThe Rolling Stone article, \u201cA Rape on Campus,\u201d provided graphic details about a brutal attack by seven fraternity members.\nHer account of being gang-raped at the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity house in 2012 was the substantive basis of the magazine\u2019s cover story.\nThere will be no repercussions for the investigative reporter or editors responsible for a now-retracted Rolling Stone cover story in November that falsely accused Phi Kappa Psi fraternity members at the University of Virginia of gang-raping a freshman coed.\nRolling Stone publisher Jann S.
