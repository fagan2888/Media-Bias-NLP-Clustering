Vihstadt took credit for raising tough questions during his six months in office and helping to lower the property tax rate, a decision that was a result of higher property values and the reaction of the board\u2019s Democratic majority to both public comments and Vihstadt\u2019s election.\n\nHowze promised fiscal responsibility, greater scrutiny of the Columbia Pike streetcar, including a voter referendum on the project, and a focus on school overcrowding.\n\n\u201cOur county stands at a crossroads, and we face stark choices,\u201d Howze said. \u201cIn the 1960s, the John Vihstadts of that day said, \u2018Let\u2019s run buses down Wilson Boulevard,\u2019 and called the Metro \u2018gold plated\u2019 and overbuilt. A decade ago, opponents of the Silver Line proposed more buses instead of extending Metro. They were wrong, and if they had prevailed we\u2019d be a poorer and more congested community today.\u201d\n\nDon Beyer (D), who is seeking the congressional seat held for many years by Rep. James Moran (D), was joined by four other candidates: Republican Micah Edmond, independent Gwendolyn Beck, Independent Green Gerry Blais and Libertarian Jeffrey Carson.\n\nBeyer, a former Virginia lieutenant governor and ex-ambassador to Switzerland and Lichtenstein, said his priorities are enacting a carbon tax, addressing the widening economic divide, defending the Affordable Care Act and supporting \u201ccommon-sense\u201d gun laws, such as outlawing gun ownership by the criminally insane. Edmond urged voters in the strongly Democratic district to elect a Republican who will work to break congressional gridlock.\n\nSchool board candidates Barbara Kanninen (D) and Audrey Clement (Green) jousted over whether schools should focus on the needs of all students or, as Clement argued, shift the focus to remedial education for disadvantaged students. Nancy van Doren is also running, as an unopposed Democrat in a concurrent special election to fill the seat left vacant by Noah Simon\u2019s Aug. 1 resignation.\n\nNeither Incumbent Sen. Mark Warner (D) nor challenger Ed Gillespie (R) attended the forum, giving Libertarian candidate Robert Sarvis an open opportunity to urge voters to break away from the majority parties and examine the Libertarian alternative. \u201cI go to the tea party events and the LGBT events, and I say the same thing,\u201d Sarvis said.\n\nThe other participant was Carla F. de la Pava (D), the deputy county treasurer, who was appointed to the treasurer\u2019s position after Frank O\u2019Leary\u2019s resignation in July. She is running unopposed for the office.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "arlington election, arlington democrats, va-politics, november elections, Va8, county board,", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Post-Labor Day kickoff of election season draws crowd as politicians make their pitches.", "title": "In Arlington County, more than 100 attend forum to hear candidates make their pitches", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/in-arlington-more-than-100-attend-forum-to-hear-candidates-pitches/2014/09/03/267ee246-335f-11e4-9e92-0899b306bbea_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/09/03/Local-Politics/Images/arlcandidateforum.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@psullivan1"}, "description": "Post-Labor Day kickoff of election season draws crowd as politicians make their pitches.", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "arlington election, arlington democrats, va-politics, november elections, Va8, county board,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "eomportal-uuid": "267ee246-335f-11e4-9e92-0899b306bbea"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9353\"", "article_summary": "More than 100 Arlingtonians crowded the county\u2019s first post-Labor Day candidates forum Tuesday night to hear a dozen office-seekers make their pitches for votes in the Nov. 4 general election.\nEdmond urged voters in the strongly Democratic district to elect a Republican who will work to break congressional gridlock.\nSchool board candidates Barbara Kanninen (D) and Audrey Clement (Green) jousted over whether schools should focus on the needs of all students or, as Clement argued, shift the focus to remedial education for disadvantaged students.\n\u201cI go to the tea party events and the LGBT events, and I say the same thing,\u201d Sarvis said.\nHowze promised fiscal responsibility, greater scrutiny of the Columbia Pike streetcar, including a voter referendum on the project, and a focus on school overcrowding."}
