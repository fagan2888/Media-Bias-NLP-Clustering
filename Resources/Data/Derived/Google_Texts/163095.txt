SANTA MARIA, Calif. -

Santa Maria kicked off "National Health Clinic Week" with the grand opening of the Del Valle Clinic on Blosser Road.

Community Health Centers of the Central Coast's administrators and community leaders cut the ribbon to their newest 14,000 square feet building, replacing two smaller, aging facilities in the city.

"With the affordable care act, we've taken on so many patients in both San Luis Obispo County and Santa Barbara County," said Maria Jauregui-Garcia, CHC Nursing Director.

Organizers are calling the Del Valle Clinic a "smart building" for its increased energy efficiency and they believe the centralized location will provide healthcare access to more people.

"We're next to a large farm worker housing community," said Ron Castle, CHC C.E.O.

"This is an area of Santa Maria that is medically underserved."

The clinic comes with 28 exam rooms and a community room, where patients can receive primary, family and chiropractic care.

Same day appointments and immediate care services will boost the clinic's services to more than 70 hours a week.

"The employees benefit, the schools benefit, kids stay in school, workers don't have to take time off, it's really a win-win for the community," said Castle.

Mental health counseling and pediatric services will be added by the end of August.
