This is what journalist Roger Parloff claims, in a puff piece in Fortune that sets a new standard in sycophancy:\n\nA gifted rhetorician and provocateur with a bottomless pocketbook, Thiel has drawn upon his wide-ranging and idiosyncratic readings in philosophy, history, economics, anthropology, and culture to become perhaps America\u2019s leading public intellectual today, assuming a mantle once held by the likes of Thorstein Veblen or Norman Mailer.\n\nThe Norman Mailer-Peter Thiel comparison may be apt. Norman Mailer was a shameless publicity hound who should have stuck to what he was good at \u2014 writing fiction.\n\nBut is Fortune correct that Peter Thiel can be compared to the early 20th-century American economist and social thinker Thorstein Veblen? Let\u2019s compare the intellectual achievements of Thorstein Veblen and Peter Thiel.\n\nThorstein Veblen (1857-1929) was a brilliant satirical observer of modern capitalist society responsible for many coinages that have entered the English lexicon, like \u201cthe higher learning,\u201d \u201cthe leisure class\u201d and \u201cconspicuous consumption.\u201d\n\nLike Thorstein Veblen, Peter Thiel knows something about coinages. He co-founded PayPal.\n\nThorstein Veblen and Peter Thiel have both been critics of American higher education. In \u201cThe Higher Learning in America\u201d(1918), Veblen claimed that American higher education had been warped by the insistence of wealthy regents and their sycophants in the press and public that colleges and universities be run like businesses.\n\nWhat are Peter Thiel\u2019s contributions to debates about higher education in the U.S.? Here is the one, according to Fortune:\n\nIn 1995 he and Sacks published a book called The Diversity Myth, in which they argued that in the campus context, \u201cthose persons complaining about oppression are generally not the ones to have experienced it firsthand.\u201d In one disturbing passage they come to the defense of a law student friend who in 1992 had shouted an antigay slur outside the cottage of a gay resident fellow as a protest against campus speech codes. The authors argue that the law student\u2019s near-universal execration afterward, official and unofficial, was disproportionate to his offense.\n\nThiel\u2019s contributions to American higher education go beyond defending students who shout anti-gay slurs on campus. Here is another of Thiel\u2019s ideas about education, according to the Fortune profile:\n\nThiel\u2019s most infamous charitable project has probably been his 20 Under 20 program, which provides gifted students between the ages of 18 and 20 with $100,000 to launch their own startups. \u2026Former Harvard president Larry Summers called the program \u201cthe single most misdirected philanthropy in this decade,\u201d according to TechCrunch, while Slate Group chairman Jacob Weisberg wrote in Newsweek, \u201cThiel fellows will have the opportunity to emulate their sponsor by halting their intellectual development around the onset of adulthood, maintaining a narrow-minded focus on getting rich as young as possible and thereby avoid the siren lure of helping others or pursuing knowledge for its own sake.\u201d\n\nThorstein Veblen\u2019s contributions to scholarship included political sociology as well as economics. In \u201cImperial Germany and the Industrial Revolution\u201d (1915), Veblen argued that the combination of authoritarian and militarist traditions and modern industrialism in Germany and Japan would make them dangerous powers \u2014 an analysis borne out in World War II, following Veblen\u2019s death in 1929.\n\nPeter Thiel, like Thorstein Veblen, has contributed to political theory. In a 2009 essay for the libertarian Cato Institute\u2019s Cato Unbound, Thiel argued that allowing women to vote had resulted in disaster:\n\nSince 1920, the vast increase in welfare beneficiaries and the extension of the franchise to women \u2014 two constituencies that are notoriously tough for libertarians \u2014 have rendered the notion of \u2018capitalist democracy\u2019 into an oxymoron.\n\nYou have to give Thiel credit for pushing the intellectual envelope. I don\u2019t know of anybody else who argues that lady suffragettes of the Model T Ford era doomed democratic capitalism to be replaced by totalitarian collectivism. Mainstream scholars in universities and think tanks have yet to wrestle with Thiel\u2019s controversial thesis that modern countries are dying from bloated welfare states because women are allowed to vote. Perhaps he is ahead of his time.\n\nThe man whom Fortune calls \u201cAmerica\u2019s leading public intellectual today\u201d also has heterodox thoughts about the nature of political sovereignty. In his capacity as a \u201cpublic intellectual,\u201d as well as his capacity as a deep-pockets donor, Thiel has supported the \u201cseastead\u201d movement. Tired of losing elections to \u201cstatists\u201d like Democrats and Republicans, libertarian \u201cseasteaders\u201d hope to renounce their U.S. citizenship and found their own sovereign, libertarian-only micro-states, to be built on repurposed oil derricks in international waters.\n\nNow why didn\u2019t Thorstein Veblen think of that?\n\nWhat has the genius crowned by Fortune as \u201cAmerica\u2019s leading public intellectual\u201d been thinking lately?\n\nBreakout Labs shines a spotlight on a contrarian contention Thiel has been advancing in essays, talks, and debates since about 2008, which has come to be known as the \u201ctech stagnation thesis.\u201d Thiel contends that the amazing advances we have seen in computer science and communications have masked ominously disappointing progress in energy, transportation, biotech, disease prevention, and space travel. That slowdown, he maintains, accounts for the near stagnation in real incomes and wages we have experienced since 1973, and for widening inequality in wealth distribution.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Fortune magazine says PayPal's co-founder is America's leading public intellectual.
