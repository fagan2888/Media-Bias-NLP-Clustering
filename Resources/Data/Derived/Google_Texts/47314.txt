Grateful Dead guitarist and co-founder Bob Weir and RatDog have cancelled all upcoming tour dates through January 2015.

According to a note posted on the band’s website, “Circumstances have necessitated that all scheduled tour dates for Bob Weir & RatDog are being cancelled. This applies to all dates on the summer tour starting on Thursday, August 14 in Boston through September 14 in Nashville and also includes the Jamaica event in January of 2015.”

No further details were included in the online announcement. However, refunds are possible at the place of purchase, according to the note.

According to Rolling Stone magazine, the 66-year-old musician may have been forced to cancel the upcoming tour due to health related issues.

“I love the guy and wish nothing but good health,” Weir’s former manager John Scher told Rolling Stone.

“He’s an extremely talented and very underrated musician. He’s an important guy. Bobby’s been having health problems for a while and now there are plenty of people who support him and want to help him get the care he needs.”
