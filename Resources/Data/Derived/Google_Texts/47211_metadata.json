Richard Hudson (R-N.C.) said during a hearing of the House Homeland Security Committee\u2019s Transportation Security Subcommittee.\n\n\u201cWhile I have great respect for [TSA] Administrator [John] Pistole, as far as I am concerned, there will always be at least three clear and substantial advantages to privatized screening,\u201d Hudson continued. \u201cNumber one, the private sector operates more efficiently than the federal government and can save precious taxpayer dollars. Number two, the private sector provides better customer service, which is severely lacking at many of our nation's screening checkpoints. And number three\u2026.with private screening, TSA can stop dealing with the time-consuming human resources issues that come with managing a workforce of over 50,000 screeners.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe SPP program is designed to allow airports to opt-out of utilizing TSA security personnel if they can prove they can provide the same level of protection with private workers at lower costs. The requests have to be approved by TSA, however, which has led to friction between GOP lawmakers and the TSA.\n\nRepublicans have championed the effort to privatize airport security for several years because they argue that many of the TSA\u2019s techniques, including its pat down hand searches and X-ray scanners, invade the privacy of airline passengers.\n\nThe TSA has come under fire often in recent year for its treatment of elderly and child passengers.\n\nPistole was not there Tuesday to defend the TSA\u2019s position on the privatization program, but the union that represents TSA workers argued that the agency\u2019s workers were better trained to meet federal standards for airport security that have been in place since the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that the screening partnership program, SPP, does not improve aviation security and it does not save the taxpayers money,\u201d American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) President J. David Cox Sr. told the panel.\n\n\u201cRather, SPP harms security, costs more, and hurts the TSOs who bear the brunt of the outsourcing program,\u201d Cox continued. \u201cOnly security contractors benefit.\u201d\n\nCox said Republicans were overstating the desire for airports to opt-out of TSA security.\n\n\u201cThere is no demand for airports to privatize the work of our nation's [Transportation Security Officers],\u201d he said. \u201cAlthough the 2012 FAA Modernization and Reform Act made it easy for airports to apply to privatize their TSA workforce, only a handful have done so. With the exception of the Montana airports, over the past two years, only three airports have asked TSA for permission to switch to private screeners.\u201d\n\nHudson said privatization program did not allow airports to skimp on security.\n\n\u201cTo be clear, this does not mean airports that participate in SPP are opting out of robust federal oversight and regulations, which were severely lacking before 9/11,\u201d he said. \u201cIt means opting to use qualified private vendors to carry out day-to-day screening functions, which lets TSA concentrate on setting and enforcing security standards.\u201d\n\nThe North Carolina lawmaker said he was open to \u201csimple but crucial\u201d changes to the program, such as increasing outreach to airports about their ability to request to participate.\n\nBut he added that \u201cthe only barrier to action is TSA's well-known resistance to expanding SPP.\u201d\n\nTSA\u2019s Screening Partnership Program Director William Benner disputed the idea that the agency has blocked the expansion of the privatization program, saying the agency has allowed 31 airports to opt-out of using its personnel, however.\n\n\u201cThe SPP is a voluntary program whereby airports may apply for SPP status and employ private security companies to conduct airport screening according to TSA standards,\u201d Benner said.\n\n\u201cParticipation depends on interest from airport operators,\u201d he continued. \u201cSince the program began in 2004, 31 airports have applied, including the original statutory five pilot airports. Of those 31, 18 are currently participating in the SPP program, and either have private contract screeners in place or are in the process of transitioning to contract screeners.\u201d\n\nBenner added that even airports that successfully opt-out of using TSA personnel still had to meet the agency\u2019s standards for protecting U.S. airline passengers.\n\n\u201cRegardless of whether an airport has private or federal employees conducting passenger screening operations, TSA maintains overall responsibility for transportation security,\u201d he said. \u201cAs new and emerging threats are identified, we must be able to adapt and modify our procedures quickly to protect the traveling public. Federal Security Directors oversee the contracted security screening operations to ensure compliance with Federal security standards throughout the aviation network.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.title": "Lawmakers spar with TSA union over private airport security", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.modified": "2014-07-29T13:26-04:00", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "title": "Lawmakers spar with TSA union over private airport security", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/213673-lawmakers-tsa-union-spar-over-private-airport-security", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/tsa_050211getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-07-29T13:26:13-04:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "author": "Keith Laing", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/213673-lawmakers-tsa-union-spar-over-private-airport-security", "dcterms.date": "2014-07-29T13:08-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Keith Laing", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Aviation security, Transportation Security Administration, TSA Security Partnership Program, American Federation of Government Employees,Richard Hudson,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-29T13:08:52-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-29T13:26:13-04:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/213673-lawmakers-tsa-union-spar-over-private-airport-security", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "card": "summary", "title": "Lawmakers spar with TSA union over private airport security"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd187\"", "article_summary": "Federal Security Directors oversee the contracted security screening operations to ensure compliance with Federal security standards throughout the aviation network.\u201d\nThe chairman of the House panel that oversees transportation security issues accused the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) on Tuesday of blocking efforts to privatize airport security checkpoints.\n\u201cRegardless of whether an airport has private or federal employees conducting passenger screening operations, TSA maintains overall responsibility for transportation security,\u201d he said.\n\u201cOnly security contractors benefit.\u201dCox said Republicans were overstating the desire for airports to opt-out of TSA security.\n\u201cThe SPP is a voluntary program whereby airports may apply for SPP status and employ private security companies to conduct airport screening according to TSA standards,\u201d Benner said."}
