Hawley is a campaigning for Attorney General.\n\nTristan Bruner, 16, is all smiles as he and his dad, Conor Bruner, of Branson West, visit with Josh Hawley, Republican candidate for attorney general after Hawley held a town hall meeting at Branson West Thursday.\n\nPosted: Friday, April 8, 2016 9:00 pm\n\nWhen Josh Hawley decided to become the first one of his family to practice law, not everyone was impressed.\n\nHis late grandfather asked, \u201cCan\u2019t you find an honest profession?\u201d\n\nBut Hawley was convinced and hasn\u2019t wavered since reading a book by the late Supreme Court Justice Anton Scalia.\n\nSpeaking Thursday at Danna\u2019s BBQ & Burger Shop in Branson West during a town hall meeting, Hawley said he learned about how the principles established by the founding fathers in the United States Constitution made all the difference in the country.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have any lawyers in our family,\u201d Hawley said.\n\nYet, he said he sensed this was his calling.\n\n\u201cI thought that\u2019s what I want to do with my life,\u201d Hawley said.\n\nHe bills his campaign for attorney general of the state of Missouri with an emphasis on protecting and fighting for religious liberty.\n\nHawley said with the current situation in the U.S. Supreme Court, electing an Attorney General who will stand up for the rights of Missourians and fight federal overreach is important.\n\n\u201cWith Justice Scalia gone, (we\u2019re) sitting at 4-4. We\u2019re not in a good position. As conservatives, we\u2019re in a very dangerous position,\u201d Hawley said.\n\nIn evaluating candidates to replace Scalia, Hawley would pose a basic litmus test, \u201cAre you committed to enforcing the Constitution as it\u2019s written, not as you think it should be?\u201d\n\nHe said Missourians should ask the same of their next attorney general.\n\nIn 2014, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of Hawley\u2019s client, Hobby Lobby, which challenged the Affordable Care Act\u2019s contraceptive mandate.\n\nAccording to Hawley, the Supreme Court has heard three cases challenging provisions of Obamacare. He said he is honored to have served as co-counsel on the only one that was victorious.\n\n\u201cWe won the Hobby-Lobby case, 5-4; and Justice Scalia was vote five,\u201d Hawley said.\n\nOne question posed during Thursday\u2019s town hall meeting at Branson West was how difficult attorney general is if a Democrat is elected as governor.\n\nHawley responded by saying, \u201cOf course, we want a Republican governor, but the governor has almost no power over the Department of Justice. The attorney general does not take direction from the governor. The governor does not tell the attorney general what to do.\u201d\n\nHawley said this differs from the federal government where the U.S. attorney general is appointed by, and serves under, the president.\n\nOn a state level, Hawley describes the attorney general as an (elected) independent executive, an office that does not fall under the authority of the legislative branch.\n\n\u201cSome of these other states that have a liberal governor, the attorney generals are going in and making a difference,\u201d Hawley said.\n\nThat is his intention in running for attorney general as a first-time candidate who has never previously held office.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to fighting the federal government, who can fight the left\u2019s agenda? The attorney general is the person who can do that,\u201d Hawley said.\n\nHawley is a native of Lexington, in rural Lafayette County. He graduated from Rockhurst High School in Kansas City, graduating with honors from Stanford before attending Yale Law School. Hawley earned clerkships at the U.S. Court of Appeals, 10th Circuit and the U. S. Supreme Court.\n\nDifferentiating himself from his opponent, state Sen. Kurt Schaefer, of Columbia, in the August Republican Primary, Hawley likened Schaefer to a professional politician.\n\nHawley said his candidacy offers a contrast as someone who has never ran for office, nor held office.\n\n\u201cThe last 24 years we\u2019ve had all these professional politicians in Jefferson City that all they think about is how can we get elected next time,\u201d Hawley said.\n\nHawley said Schaefer has been endorsed by the AFL-CIO. The labor union did endorse the state senator in his re-election bid in 2012.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a moderate Republican from Boone County. We just disagree on the issues,\u201d Hawley said.\n\nHawley said Missouri ranks 48th of 50 states in job growth and is 49th in economic development.\n\n\u201cLabor unions have far too much influence in our state,\u201d Hawley said. \u201cIn all the most important cases over the last seven years, our attorney general has been on the side of Obama.\u201d\n\nHawley also said he is 100 percent pro-life and has been so his whole life.\n\nHawley said if elected attorney general he will work to maintain the integrity of elections.\n\n\u201cElections are a sacred thing because that\u2019s how we govern ourselves,\u201d Hawley said.\n\n\u201cThe Obama and the left\u2019s agenda is to turn our government away from being a government by the people for the people and turn it into a government by expert bureaucrats,\u201d Hawley said.\n\nAs for the 2015 Supreme Court ruling legalizing same-sex marriage, Hawley said the big issue of the day is religious liberty.\n\n\u201cIn the wake of what the Supreme Court has done, we\u2019ve got to make sure our religious liberties are protected,\u201d Hawley said. \u201cThat\u2019s got to be a priority for the next attorney general.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Branson Tri-Lakes News", "description": "When Josh Hawley decided to become the first one of his family to practice law, not everyone was impressed.", "title": "Attorney general candidate holds town hall meeting in Branson West", "url": "http://bransontrilakesnews.com/news_story/article_c540f520-fdb8-11e5-9b51-9b1f6adb42f2.html", "image": {"width": 575, "identifier": "http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/bransontrilakesnews.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/e/8b/e8b9c9ea-fdb9-11e5-9ed0-378c2b1508c9/5707fc236f471.image.jpg?resize=575%2C630", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@tweetmeme", "card": "summary"}, "description": "When Josh Hawley decided to become the first one of his family to practice law, not everyone was impressed.", "keywords": "news_story", "news_keywords": "news_story"}, "article_summary": "Tristan Bruner, 16, is all smiles as he and his dad, Conor Bruner, of Branson West, visit with Josh Hawley, Republican candidate for attorney general after Hawley held a town hall meeting at Branson West Thursday.\nOne question posed during Thursday\u2019s town hall meeting at Branson West was how difficult attorney general is if a Democrat is elected as governor.\nThat is his intention in running for attorney general as a first-time candidate who has never previously held office.\nThe governor does not tell the attorney general what to do.\u201dHawley said this differs from the federal government where the U.S. attorney general is appointed by, and serves under, the president.\n\u201cThat\u2019s got to be a priority for the next attorney general.\u201d"}
