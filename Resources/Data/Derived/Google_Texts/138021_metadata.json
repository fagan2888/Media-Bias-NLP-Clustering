The Wall Street Journal reports that Senate Republicans are hard at work hatching a new strategy to accomplish a key piece of their agenda: Undermining President Obama\u2019s chances of reaching an international deal in which major countries agree to curb climate emissions, by sowing doubts about his ability to deliver on our end of the bargain.\n\nRepublicans are already fighting in court to block Obama\u2019s proposed new EPA rules curbing emissions from existing power plans, which are central to U.S. efforts to reach a global climate deal in talks later this year. They argue that the rules are unconstitutional and amount to more executive overreach. The Journal reports that the idea is to send a message that Obama cannot unilaterally negotiate a climate deal, and the model is Tom Cotton\u2019s recent letter to Iran:\n\nSen. James Inhofe said Mr. Obama\u2019s unilateral pursuit of the climate accord exceeds the scope of president\u2019s power. Mr. Inhofe, the chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, plans to hold a hearing this summer focused on the Senate\u2019s advice-and-consent process and its possible application in international climate negotiations. Additionally, Mr. Inhofe said the Iran letter, which was penned by Sen. Tom Cotton, could be a useful model to send a message about the climate agreement. \u201cThe Tom Cotton letter was an educational effort,\u201d Mr. Inhofe said in an interview. Other countries think \u201cif the president of the United States says something, it\u2019s just automatic\u2026His letter was over there saying, \u2018the president says he can do this; he can\u2019t do this.\u2019 \u201d\n\nInhofe, of course, is the same Senator who recently brandished a snowball on the Senate floor to disprove global warming. Now Senator Snowball is emerging, fittingly enough, as a lead architect of the Senate Republican strategy to block a global climate deal. (One imagines he had the forethought to keep snowballs in a freezer in his Senate office, to haul out at this summer\u2019s hearings.)\n\nThe core question of whether Obama has the authority to carry out the EPA rules that will be crucial to making an international deal work will eventually be decided in court (his authority to negotiate the deal itself could conceivably be tested in court, too). But these GOP moves appear to be about more than just legal differences over the president\u2019s authority and more than merely an effort to assert more Congressional oversight over the process, a legitimate goal unto itself.\n\nRather, just as on Iran, the moves also appear designed to sow uncertainty abroad, in hopes of imperiling Obama\u2019s ability to negotiate the deal itself. Indeed, the Journal story claims that \u201cmany Republicans\u201d see this as a \u201cpotential avenue\u201d to \u201ccomplicate negotiations of the international agreement.\u201d\n\nThe climate maneuvering is related to the battle over the Iran deal in another way, too. They are a reminder that the eventual 2016 GOP nominee will have pledged to retreat from U.S. international engagement when it comes to solving multiple major challenges \u2014 climate change; Iran nukes \u2014 even as Hillary Clinton promises to sustain and build upon that international engagement.\n\n*******************************************************************************\n\n* A BIG TEST FOR IRAN BILL: The Senate will vote this week on the bipartisan Corker-Cardin bill requiring a Congressional vote on Obama\u2019s authority to temporarily lift Iran sanctions to implement a nuclear deal. But it could be doomed by new amendments:\n\nAmendments filed by lawmakers\u2026include one that would require Iran to recognize Israel and another that would give any final nuclear deal the status of a treaty, which would require ratification by two-thirds of the Senate. Another proposal would require the release of American citizens detained in Iran as part of an agreement.\n\nObama grudgingly backs Corker-Cardin in its current form. But any of these amendments could kill the deal. Thus, the amended bill would draw a veto, and enough Dems might drop off to preclude a veto-proof majority. Will the desire to \u201ctoughen up\u201d the bill end up killing it?\n\n* AMERICANS BACK IRAN FRAMEWORK BY WIDE MARGIN: A new Quinnipiac poll finds Americans back the preliminary framework to curb Iran\u2019s nuclear program by 58-33. This, even though 62 percent are not confident the deal would prevent Iran from developing nukes: Perhaps Americans are skeptical the deal will work, but want to try it, anyway.\n\nWhile independents agree with the broader public on the framework by 60-33 \u2014 as do Democrats, by 76-15 \u2014 Republicans oppose it by 56-37, another reason the eventual GOP nominee will have pledged to roll back any eventual deal.\n\n* REPUBLICANS BACK ALLOWING BUSINESSES TO REFUSE GAYS: The new Quinnipiac poll also finds that Americans say by 58-35 that a business should not be allowed \u201cto refuse service\u201d to gays and lesbians if the business says \u201csays homosexuality violates its owners\u2019 religious beliefs.\u201d\n\nThe poll question is too simplistic \u2014 it implicitly asks whether such a refusal is acceptable in all cases, as opposed to in narrow exceptions \u2014 and may skew the results in favor of a ban. Yet even with this wording, Republicans say a business should be allowed to refuse service on this basis, by 56-37.\n\n* ON GAY MARRIAGE, IT\u2019S KENNEDY VERSUS SCALIA: The Supreme Court will hear cases tomorrow on whether there\u2019s a Constitutional right to gay marriage. Robert Barnes has a terrific look at Anthony Kennedy\u2019s legacy as the author of previous pro-gay-rights decisions, and his chief antagonist, Antonin Scalia. This, from lawyer Paul Smith, is key:\n\nScalia believes the only freedoms that should be viewed as protected by the Constitution \u201care those that have been protected under American law throughout our history, defined at the most specific level,\u201d Smith said. Otherwise, the people decide. Kennedy, Smith said, \u201cbelieves that each generation has the right to conceive of newer and broader forms of liberty that merit constitutional protection. He sees history as a guide but not a straitjacket.\u201d\n\nReminder: 61 percent of Americans \u2014 and surprisingly large percentages of Republicans and Conservatives \u2014 oppose state laws banning gay marriage, which are at the center of the case.\n\n* AMERICANS ARE CONFLICTED ABOUT GOVERNMENT: E.J. Dionne looks at a phenomenon taking hold in multiple countries, our own included: Electorates want government to do more to reduce inequality, but are also losing faith in government\u2019s ability to do exactly that. And on top of that, increasing partisanship is imperiling politicians\u2019 ability to \u201caggregate sustainable majorities,\u201d which is \u201ca big problem for self-government.\u201d\n\nAs Dionne notes, the early indications are that the 2016 campaign, whatever the outcome, may not break this problem.\n\n* THE REAL MEANING OF HILLARY\u2019S SHIFTS: Hillary Clinton has shifted on immigration and gay marriage, and now backs a Constitutional amendment on campaign finance. Brian Beutler has a good piece explaining why this is actually good news for the left:\n\nIf indeed she\u2019s merely betting that things like campaign finance reform, same-sex marriage, and immigration reform will amount to a winning platform \u2014 then it\u2019s an acknowledgment that the Obama coalition is stable, loyal, and larger than the Republican electorate\u2026And if those reliably liberal positions turn out to be reliably winning positions with the national electorate, that would mean America itself has moved durably to the left.\n\nAlso, as Beutler notes, there\u2019s an irony here: \u201cIt would also, finally, undo the rightward shift that Clinton\u2019s husband initiated more than 20 years ago.\u201d Remember, Clinton signed DOMA \u2014 the overturning of which could help pave the way to a Constitutional right to gay marriage.\n\n* AND CONSERVATIVES DEMAND NO-SURRENDER ON OBAMACARE: Politico reports on a developing GOP conflict over Obamacare: GOP leaders want to use the \u201creconciliation\u201d tactic to pass a \u201cfix\u201d if SCOTUS guts subsidies. But conservatives are balking:\n\nGOP leaders are eyeing reconciliation as a way to approve a potential \u201cfix\u201d for Obamacare should the need arise. Some Republicans think it could give the GOP a golden opportunity to force Obama\u2019s hand: When he finds himself in a jam, with millions stranded over health care, they hope he could be forced to accept a GOP alternative that helps those individuals. But some conservatives want no part of what they view as an attempt to rescue the law.\n\nAs noted the other day, Republicans want to pass a \u201ccontingency fix\u201d to push off the political fallout from millions losing subsidies until after the election, but conservatives may not let them.", "article_metadata": {"description": "On climate and Iran, Republicans work to block Obama's efforts at international engagement.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/WashingtonPostPlumLine?ref=hl", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "On climate and Iran, Republicans work to block Obama's efforts at international engagement.", "title": "Morning Plum: The GOP plot to undermine Obama\u2019s push for global climate deal", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/04/27/morning-plum-the-gop-plot-to-undermine-obamas-push-for-global-climate-deal/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/03/15/Editorial-Opinion/Images/2015-03-15T161520Z_01_TOR606_RTRIDSP_3_IRAN-NUCLEAR-USA-1390.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@theplumlinegs"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/04/27/morning-plum-the-gop-plot-to-undermine-obamas-push-for-global-climate-deal/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "iran, iran nuclear deal, Congressional Republicans, epa, environmental protection agency, epa rules, carbon emissions, global warming, obamacare, king v. burwell, gay marriage", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/WashingtonPostPlumLine?ref=hl"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "iran, iran nuclear deal, Congressional Republicans, epa, environmental protection agency, epa rules, carbon emissions, global warming, obamacare, king v. burwell, gay marriage"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd5753\"", "article_summary": "Now Senator Snowball is emerging, fittingly enough, as a lead architect of the Senate Republican strategy to block a global climate deal.\nRepublicans are already fighting in court to block Obama\u2019s proposed new EPA rules curbing emissions from existing power plans, which are central to U.S. efforts to reach a global climate deal in talks later this year.\nMr. Inhofe, the chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, plans to hold a hearing this summer focused on the Senate\u2019s advice-and-consent process and its possible application in international climate negotiations.\nRather, just as on Iran, the moves also appear designed to sow uncertainty abroad, in hopes of imperiling Obama\u2019s ability to negotiate the deal itself.\n* AMERICANS BACK IRAN FRAMEWORK BY WIDE MARGIN: A new Quinnipiac poll finds Americans back the preliminary framework to curb Iran\u2019s nuclear program by 58-33."}
