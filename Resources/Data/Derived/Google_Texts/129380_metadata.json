The jihadist in the video spoke with a London accent, prompting questions about whether the man was in fact a British national.\n\nIn response to these questions, British Prime Minister David Cameron suspended his vacation and vowed to get to the bottom of the situation. Obama, on the other hand, returned to Martha's Vineyard late Tuesday evening to rejoin his family on vacation. A statement was released through a spokesman late last night that said Obama was \"appalled\" by the gruesome beheading.\n\nCompare:\n\nThe Prime Minister has broken off his holiday in Cornwall after just a day, having previously said that he would return \"immediately\" if the situation in Iraq deteriorated. He made the announcement after Philip Hammond said that it appeared that the Islamic State extremist who beheaded Mr Foley is British.\n\nMeanwhile:\n\nPresident Obama went back to his vacation on Martha\u2019s Vineyard Tuesday evening following less than 48 hours in Washington, leaving people puzzled over why he came back in the first place. Obama\u2019s two days in Washington were mostly quiet, and concluded with the president receiving his daily national security briefing in the morning, and joining Vice President Biden to huddle with members of his economic team in the afternoon. Administration officials have insisted for weeks that the president just wanted to return to the White House for a series of meetings, but the explanation was met with a healthy dose of skepticism, since Obama rarely interrupts his vacations.\n\nThis is unacceptable behavior from the president, and he should look to Cameron for guidance on how to handle a situation like this. It isn't even confirmed that the man in question is British (for all we know, he could have been taught English by a Londoner or is a heck of an impressionist), yet Cameron recognized the gravity of the situation and did the appropriate thing by suspending his vacation.\n\nIt's no wonder ISIS thinks they can walk all over us.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Cameron knows what's up..05/26/2016 19:54:27PM EST.", "author": "Christine Rousselle", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Cameron knows what's up.", "title": "Christine Rousselle - Contrast: David Cameron Suspends Vacation Over Foley Killing; Obama Heads Back To Vineyard", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/christinerousselle/2014/08/20/contrast-david-cameron-suspends-vacation-n1880923", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/191/6db98888-072f-4f0a-9308-bad9aca92c3e.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Cameron knows what's up.", "title": "Christine Rousselle - Contrast: David Cameron Suspends Vacation Over Foley Killing; Obama Heads Back To Vineyard", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/christinerousselle/2014/08/20/contrast-david-cameron-suspends-vacation-n1880923", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/191/6db98888-072f-4f0a-9308-bad9aca92c3e.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Contrast: David Cameron Suspends Vacation Over Foley Killing; Obama Heads Back To Vineyard , Christine Rousselle, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "In response to these questions, British Prime Minister David Cameron suspended his vacation and vowed to get to the bottom of the situation.\nObama, on the other hand, returned to Martha's Vineyard late Tuesday evening to rejoin his family on vacation.\nA statement was released through a spokesman late last night that said Obama was \"appalled\" by the gruesome beheading.\nThe jihadist in the video spoke with a London accent, prompting questions about whether the man was in fact a British national.\nThis is unacceptable behavior from the president, and he should look to Cameron for guidance on how to handle a situation like this."}
