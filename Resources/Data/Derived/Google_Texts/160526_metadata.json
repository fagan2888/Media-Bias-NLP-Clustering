Americans flocked to the chain and the company saw sales grow and grow, typically by double digits annually.\n\nBut this past fall, the chain quickly fell from grace after an E. coli outbreak was traced to Chipotle\u2019s restaurants, sickening 55 people across 11 states. Another E. coli outbreak traced back to Chipotle saw five people in three states fall ill. And then a norovirus outbreak at a Chipotle in Boston sickened 140 people.\n\nRelated: Why Chipotle Wants to Give Its Workers More Than a McJob\n\nSuddenly, nobody wanted Chipotle. Sales at the chain\u2019s restaurants open at least 13 months plunged 14.6 percent in the last three months of 2015. Profit plummeted 44 percent and overall revenue was down 6.8 percent. Steve Ells, the chain\u2019s founder, chairman and co-CEO, called the quarter \u201cthe most challenging period in Chipotle\u2019s history.\u201d\n\nThe E. coli outbreaks may have passed, but Chipotle\u2019s challenges aren\u2019t over yet. The company still has to figure out how to regain the trust of its customers and woo them back for more burrito bowls.\n\nChipotle\u2019s more than 2,000 restaurants were shuttered for four hours on Monday to allow for a \u201cvirtual\u201d town hall meeting with all company employees. At the meeting, Ells sought to reassure Chipotle\u2019s more than 50,000 employees and announce steps the company was taking to improve food safety. \u201cPeople will come back,\u201d Ells reportedly said during the meeting.\n\nTo deliver on that promise, another goal of the company-wide meeting was \u201cto get all of the employees clear on what has to happen,\u201d says Allen Adamson, founder of marketing consultancy firm BrandSimple. \u201cIn the service business, the most important customer touch point is the employee.\u201d\n\nAaron Allen, a restaurant consultant, adds that the closure of all Chipotle locations shows consumers \u2014 and was intended to show them \u2014 how seriously the chain is taking the situation.\n\nThe company also used the restaurant closures to give customers a powerful incentive to come back: free food. Signs in store windows invited customers who were inconvenienced by the restaurants\u2019 closings to text the company to receive a coupon for a free burrito. The coupon codes quickly bounced around the Internet.\n\nAdamson says this promotion is a good way to get customers back in the habit of eating at Chipotle. He warns, though, that \u201cpromotions alone won\u2019t do it. The company needs to make tangible changes that the customer can see.\u201d\n\nRelated: 18 Companies Americans Hate Dealing With the Most\n\nTo that end, how Chipotle survives this crisis may depend on the company\u2019s new food-safety initiatives. In January, Chipotle detailed new procedures, including more stringent inspections of ingredients, changes to food prep and handling, more employee training and paid sick leave so that workers don\u2019t feel pressure to come in when they\u2019re ill. On Monday, the company announced a $10 million commitment to help small farmers keep up with those new food-safety standards so that it can keep sourcing food from local growers. The money will go toward helping pay for more rigorous testing protocols and education.\n\nIn total, Chipotle plans to spend $50 million on food-safety initiatives and to inform customers of the steps it\u2019s taking. Consumers can expect a \u201cblitz of Chipotle ad campaigns in the coming months,\u201d Allen says.\n\nWill that be enough? Adamson sees a long road ahead for the company, which he says has been slow to communicate to customers how it plans to prevent these outbreaks from happening again. \u201cCustomers want to see tangible evidence and tangible action to give them assurance that the next time they go in they won\u2019t need a Pepto-Bismol after,\u201d he says.\n\nStill, he praises the forward-looking approach. \u201cThey\u2019re not fixing what happened yesterday, but setting up a culture to anticipate what else could happen. They\u2019re creating a culture to prevent problems and not just repair problems,\u201d he says.\n\nPrevention is key. \u201cIf they have another one of these problems in the next six months, that could spell disaster,\u201d Allen says.\n\nRelated: The 11 Worst Fast Food Restaurants in America\n\nAvoiding more problems and slowly winning back customers is one thing. Recapturing the explosive growth the chain once had may be a much bigger challenge.\n\n\u201cThey were a hot growing brand,\u201d Adamson says. \u201cThey\u2019re not just getting back to where they were nine months ago. The real test will be if they can regain momentum.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Since going public 10 years ago, Chipotle has built its reputation on providing the sp", "title": "Will Chipotle Ever Win Back Its Customers?", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/02/09/Will-Chipotle-Ever-Win-Back-Its-Customers", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/02092016_Chipotle_Closed_Doors.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/02/09/Will-Chipotle-Ever-Win-Back-Its-Customers", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/02092016_Chipotle_Closed_Doors.jpg", "creator": "@milliedent", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Since going public 10 years ago, Chipotle has built its reputation on providing the sp", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "In total, Chipotle plans to spend $50 million on food-safety initiatives and to inform customers of the steps it\u2019s taking.\nRelated: Why Chipotle Wants to Give Its Workers More Than a McJobSuddenly, nobody wanted Chipotle.\nAdamson says this promotion is a good way to get customers back in the habit of eating at Chipotle.\nRelated: The 11 Worst Fast Food Restaurants in AmericaAvoiding more problems and slowly winning back customers is one thing.\nAnother E. coli outbreak traced back to Chipotle saw five people in three states fall ill.
