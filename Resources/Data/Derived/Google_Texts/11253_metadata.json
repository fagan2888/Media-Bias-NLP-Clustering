He also wants to fully repeal Obamacare and abolish the Federal Reserve.\n\nGlenn Beck interviewed the former NFL player on his radio program Monday, and asked the man how he became so passionate about current events.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got four children. I got five grandchildren. And I\u2019ve lived the American dream,\u201d Didier said. \u201cI got to play in the NFL. Three Super Bowls. And it was all when Ronald Reagan was the president and this country was united. We had our first black quarterback by the name of Doug Williams, and I caught a pass from him in Super Bowl XXII. And since then we\u2019ve been on a slippery slope going downhill.\u201d\n\nDidier said America has lost its direction, and that nobody looks at the Constitution for guidance anymore. He said he wants to be part of the equation to get the country \u201cback on track\u201d so America\u2019s children and grandchildren can live their dreams, too.\n\n\u201cHow would you expect to get the Department of Education and Energy eliminated?\u201d Beck asked.\n\n\u201cEverybody thinks [the Department of Education] has been around a long time,\u201d Didier responded. \u201cIt was brought into play when Jimmy Carter was president. And when it was brought into play, we ranked third in the world. Today we rank 36th in the world. We\u2019re losing ground because we\u2019re not teaching the core principles of education anymore. We are now in this Common Core that I\u2019m absolutely set against. I want to give this back to the states.\u201d\n\nDidier said one of his main priorities is to \u201cunshackle our industries and let them run again.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is one of the reasons I\u2019m running for this position,\u201d he said. \u201cMy wife and I, we farm a thousand acres with two of my sons and daughter, and we are under attack. They have determined a White Bluffs bladderpod is an endangered species, and they are using that as a means to take away our water, as they\u2019re doing all across America. The EPA was created December 2nd, 1970, by Richard Nixon, with an \u2018R\u2019 by his name. This agency doesn\u2019t even have the authority over the American people because it \u2026 was supposed to be created through the legislature.\u201d\n\nDidier said lawmakers need to cut the funds of federal agencies doing harm to America, or we will be a nation that \u201cwill not pass down freedom to our children.\u201d\n\nWatch the complete interview, below.\n\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nThe full episode of The Glenn Beck Program, along with many other live-streaming shows and thousands of hours of on-demand content, is available on just about any digital device.
