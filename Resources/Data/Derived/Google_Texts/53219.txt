Seven people have been injured in a chairlift accident at a Maine ski area that had a similar incident five years ago.

Sugarloaf Mountain Resort spokesman Ethan Austin says the resort believes none of the injuries sustained Saturday are life-threatening. Three of the injured were taken to a hospital for treatment.

About 200 people were riding the King Pine quad lift Saturday morning when the lift stopped, then went backward. The lift was stopped and evacuated.

The resort says the injured were treated by ski patrol and taken off the mountain to emergency medical responders at the scene.

The cause of the accident is unknown.

Sugarloaf was the site of another chairlift accident in 2010 in which a 35-year-old lift derailed, injuring eight skiers.
