It also raised questions over other potential financial skeletons in Europe.\n\nThe committee hearings are trying to figure out how Espirito Santo\u2019s international tourism-to-farming business empire, with the bank at its heart, collapsed so suddenly.\n\nThe tensest moment of the hearings in Parliament came last week with the testimony of two cousins: dapper former bank CEO and family patriarch Ricardo Espirito Santo Salgado, 70, who rubs shoulders with European royalty; and pugnacious board member Jose Maria Ricciardi, who is 10 years younger and tried to oust Salgado in a boardroom coup last year.\n\nIn almost 17 hours of testimony that ended in the early hours of the morning, the pair testified separately and gave contradictory versions of events.\n\nSalgado denied any wrongdoing and pointed the blame at others. The Portuguese government and Bank of Portugal, he claims, refused his last-minute plea to help the bank avoid bankruptcy.\n\nAnd Salgado accused a rogue Luxembourg-based company accountant of concealing debts of more than 1 billion euros. He also regretted obscure business deals at the bank\u2019s Angolan arm, BES Angola, which holds more than 1 billion euros in bad loans to reportedly unidentified creditors.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bankers at war: Portugal probe exposes crisis feud", "title": "Bankers at war: Portugal probe exposes crisis feud", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Bankers at war: Portugal probe exposes crisis feud", "title": "Bankers at war: Portugal probe exposes crisis feud", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/12/15/bankers_at_war_portugal_probe_exposes_crisis_feud/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/portugal-bankers-at-war.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Bankers at war: Portugal probe exposes crisis feud", "title": "Bankers at war: Portugal probe exposes crisis feud", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/portugal-bankers-at-war.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Barry Hatton", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Regulators have already accused Banco Espirito Santo\u2019s leadership of fraud, forgery and money-laundering in the run-up to its collapse in July.\nBanco Espirito Santo\u2019s demise reignited fears over Portugal, which is one of the eurozone\u2019s most fragile economies and which needed to be bailed out in 2011.\nThe Portuguese government and Bank of Portugal, he claims, refused his last-minute plea to help the bank avoid bankruptcy.\nThe committee hearings are trying to figure out how Espirito Santo\u2019s international tourism-to-farming business empire, with the bank at its heart, collapsed so suddenly.\nTopics: From the Wires, NewsLISBON, Portugal (AP) \u2014 Beware of bankers bearing a grudge."}
