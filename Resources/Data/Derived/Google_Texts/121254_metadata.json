But that doesn\u2019t mean ACOs will never merit scrutiny from the Federal Trade Commission, FTC Bureau of Competition Director Deborah Feinstein says.\n\nTo date, the FTC hasn\u2019t opposed the formation of an ACO, Feinstein told attendees at the recent National Accountable Care Organization Summit in Washington, D.C., sponsored by Global Health Care LLC. In addition, it hasn\u2019t taken any enforcement action against ACOs, nor has it received complaints that might warrant further inquiry.\n\n\u201cAs a result, we are confident that antitrust concerns are not preventing the formation of beneficial ACOs,\u201d she said. However, the FTC\u2019s lack of action so far doesn\u2019t mean ACOs can become complacent \u2014 they still need to make sure they aren\u2019t engaging in anticompetitive activity, she added.\n\nFeinstein said the FTC looks carefully at whether the providers in question are financially or clinically integrated, and whether the agreement between them is necessary to accomplish the precompetitive benefits of the integration. In addition, the commission asks several threshold questions when reviewing provider collaborations such as ACOs:\n\nDoes the proposed arrangement offer the potential for pro-consumer cost savings or quality improvements in the provision of health care services?\n\nIs there bona fide integration or is this simply a mechanism to enhance leverage with payers through joint negotiation?\n\nEven if there is bona fide integration, are any price or other agreements among participants regarding the terms on which they will deal with health care insurers reasonably necessary to achieve the benefits of the collaboration?\n\n\u201cIf the answer to these questions is \u2018yes,\u2019 then the collaboration is not considered a per se illegal agreement, but rather is evaluated under a rule of reason standard, which assesses whether the likely effect of the collaboration will be to benefit or harm competition or consumers,\u201d Feinstein said.\n\nCertain ACO features or behavior are likely to raise red flags for antitrust enforcers, especially for ACOs that have high market shares or other indications of market power, she says. These include:\n\nPreventing payers from steering patients to certain providers.\n\nTying sales of the ACO\u2019s services to the private payer\u2019s purchase of other services from providers outside the ACO.\n\nRequiring exclusivity that discourages providers from contracting with payers outside the ACO.\n\nRestricting a payer\u2019s ability to make available to enrollees information on cost, quality, efficiency and performance.\n\n\u201cThese types of conduct, in combination with high market shares, may prevent private payers from obtaining lower prices and better quality service for their enrollees,\u201d Feinstein said. \u201cAdditionally, regardless of market share, the sharing of competitively sensitive information among ACO participants that threatens or leads to price fixing or other collusion for competing services provided outside the ACO raises significant antitrust concerns.\u201d\n\nThe \u201crule of reason\u201d standard evaluates how the proposed agreement will affect the health care market in question, including whether the parties will continue to operate independently and what other alternatives are available for potential customers of the joint venture, she said.\n\n\u201cUltimately, we make a determination as to whether a particular agreement, on balance, benefits consumers or is likely to diminish quality, reduce output or increase price,\u201d Feinstein said.\n\nThe FTC\u2019s analysis of ACOs \u201cis similar to our analysis of joint ventures in any market,\u201d she said. The FTC has issued several antitrust advisory opinions explaining what it wants to see in clinical integration by health care providers, and ACOs must meet those standards to benefit consumers, she says.\n\nNewly formed ACOs can ask the FTC \u2014 which works with CMS and the Department of Justice (DOJ) on this issue \u2014 for expedited review of their organizations in order to obtain antitrust guidance, Feinstein said.\n\nThe FTC continues \u201cto hear claims that antitrust principles are at odds with the mandates of the Affordable Care Act,\u201d she told conference attendees. However, those arguments \u201cmisunderstand the focus and intent of federal antitrust enforcement,\u201d Feinstein explained. \u201cStated simply, there is no \u2018approved way\u2019 to compete. Conversely, there is no laundry list of infractions that could automatically undermine a business arrangement.\u201d\n\nInstead, \u201cthe antitrust laws proscribe behavior that, on the whole, reduces consumer welfare,\u201d she said. \u201cUltimately, we believe that the imperatives of developing lower cost, higher quality health care can coexist with continued enforcement of the antitrust laws.\u201d\n\nContact Feinstein via the FTC public affairs office at (202) 326-2180.\n\n\u00a9 2014 by Atlantic Information Services, Inc.
