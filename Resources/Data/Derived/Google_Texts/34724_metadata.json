But when taken with other central nervous system depressants, like pain killers, alprazolam can be dangerous \u2014 it can cause lowered breathing and heart rate and can lead to lost consciousness. According to the SAMHSA report, 81 percent of the cases that were studied involved patients taking the psychiatric drug in combination with other prescription drugs and/or alcohol. Of the 52,000 patients that used Xanax with several other drugs, 85 percent of them mixed it with prescription drugs and 46 percent used it with illegal drugs. Another 39 percent combined it with booze.\n\n\u201cWhen used as directed, alprazolam is safe and effective, but misuse can result in serious health consequences,\u201d Hyde said. Taking alprazolam could cause dizziness or drowsiness, even if taken correctly \u2014 but it\u2019s still recommended to avoid driving or using machinery, as well as alcohol, when on it.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing growth in the number of people who are getting into trouble with these drugs,\u201d Pete Delany, director of SAMHSA\u2019s Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality, said. \u201cPatients really need to be educated that if these drugs are misused, they can be really, really dangerous.\u201d One of the greatest concerns among medical professionals is that the rise in Xanax abuse seems to parallel the increase of pain killer misuse as well \u2014 it\u2019s \u201cespecially concerning in light of the dramatic rise in nonmedical use of opioid painkillers like oxycodone [Oxycontin] and Vicodin, because these increases in nonmedical use parallel the rapid rise in accidental overdose deaths in our country,\u201d Dr. Eric Collins, an addiction psychiatrist at Silver Hill Hospital in Conn., told HealthDay. There was a total of 1.2 million ER visits linked to prescription drug abuse in 2011.\n\n\"Everyone with prescriptions for sedatives and opioid painkillers should lock them up while they are in use and dispose of them when there are leftover, unneeded supplies,\" Dr. Lewis Nelson, professor in the department of emergency medicine at NYU Langone Medical Center, told HealthDay.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "opioids, painkiller misuse, alprazolam", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "As painkiller misuse rises, so does the number of ER visits linked to alprazolam, a sedative used to treat anxiety and depression.", "title": "Xanax Abuse Leads To Sharp Rise In Emergency Room Visits", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/er-visits-linked-xanax-abuse-increase-patients-mix-psychiatric-drug-other-prescription-pain-killers", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/05/22/painkillers.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "As painkiller misuse rises, so does the number of ER visits linked to alprazolam, a sedative used to treat anxiety and depression.", "title": "Xanax Abuse Leads To Sharp Rise In Emergency Room Visits", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/er-visits-linked-xanax-abuse-increase-patients-mix-psychiatric-drug-other-prescription-pain-killers", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/05/22/painkillers.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/05/22/painkillers.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Drugs", "published_time": "2014-05-22T19:40:36-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-05-22T19:39:37-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "As painkiller misuse rises, so does the number of ER visits linked to alprazolam, a sedative used to treat anxiety and depression."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbee5\"", "article_summary": "According to the SAMHSA report, 81 percent of the cases that were studied involved patients taking the psychiatric drug in combination with other prescription drugs and/or alcohol.\nOf the 52,000 patients that used Xanax with several other drugs, 85 percent of them mixed it with prescription drugs and 46 percent used it with illegal drugs.\nThe number of ER visits linked to alprazolam rose from 57,000 in 2005 to 124,000 in 2011, the SAMHSA report concluded.\nThere was a total of 1.2 million ER visits linked to prescription drug abuse in 2011.\nAlprazolam is a medication used to treat anxiety, insomnia and depression, and was the most commonly prescribed psychiatric drug in 2011."}
