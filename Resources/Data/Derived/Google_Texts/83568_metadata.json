Scott Walker stands on the North Lawn of the White House before making remarks to the news media, February 27, 2012 in Washington, DC. Walker, a Republican, will probably face a recall election this year, an effort spearheaded in part by Democrats and pro-union supporters in his state.\n\nWisconsin Gov. Scott Walker is no fan of President Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act. He didn\u2019t accept an expansion of Medicaid or set up a federal healthcare exchange. But he has a message for other Republicans who may be looking to exploit the White House\u2019s political misfortunes: \u201cDon\u2019t spike the ball.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to reporters at a meeting hosted by National Review, Walker, a potential 2016 GOP presidential candidate, cautioned his party against being seen as rooting for the law\u2019s failure.\n\n\u201cOne of the things I caution Republicans against is don\u2019t run out and spike the ball,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t relish the fact that Obamacare is not working.\u201d\n\nWalker, the vice chair of the Republican Governors Association who faces a tough race for reelection next year, said GOP lawmakers on Capitol Hill should take a page from governors with a focus on outcomes.\n\n\u201cIn the end, it gives me no comfort that there are people in my state who will fall through the cracks because of the failure of the federal government kind of puts them in no-mans land,\u201d Walker said, \u201cI think as Republicans, people across America are going to expect us to be as disappointed as they are.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think Republicans need to be careful so that in no way do we look like we\u2019re piling on,\u201d he continued. \u201cBecause if you do, my guess is the next move on the left will be to try and seize on it if that were to happen, look, somehow we sabotaged this, that we\u2019re the ones to blame. It\u2019s a ridiculous intellectual argument, but from an emotional standpoint, you can see how it could happen. \u201d\n\nWalker added a criticism of the shutdown strategy advocated by Sen. Ted Cruz last month. \u201cMost of us governors, we\u2019re all for principled fights and things, but we like outcomes,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to see an endgame. We want to see some way to get something done.\u201d\n\nBut Walker said Obamacare will be a potent weapon for the GOP in next year\u2019s midterm elections and in the 2016 presidential race. \u201cIt\u2019s so important to let the public see first hand what is happening, to make it an issue in the 2014 election, and then presumably two years thereafter,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Wisconsin Gov.
