Barry and Jane Elson

Barry and Jane Elson are finally out of their insurance nightmare.

They turned to 8 On Your Side two weeks ago when they discovered their Affordable Care Act plan was useless. They paid and received insurance, but were then sent an email saying they had no insurance at all.

After questions from 8 On Your Side, federal authorities jumped in to help. The Elsons received a call from a Washington, D.C. insurance marketplace office.

“They said they read the article from somebody and they were going to take care of things,” Elson said.

How things got out of hand

The ordeal started in September. First, they bought a Florida Blue plan. But their doctors’ claims were denied because of computer errors. And then, the Elsons were told they owed thousands. They faced threats from collectors.

“Number one, they listed my husband’s gender as female and they had my date of birth incorrect,” Jane Elson said.

No one at Florida Blue or the insurance marketplace would help.

Then it got worse. Still fighting with Florida Blue, the couple decided to go with a different carrier for the new year. They paid nearly $500 for a plan with United Health Care. They received insurance cards. However, they soon received an email stating they have “no medical coverage.”

The Elsons turned to 8 On Your Side for answers. We went straight to the state regulators, the watchdogs for insurance companies.

And now, the Elsons can finally get their prescriptions filled and their doctors’ bills are being paid.
