But it was one performance that put Klay Thompson over the top, edging out Houston\u2019s James Harden as The Denver Post\u2019s NBA player of the week for the evaluation period of Jan. 17-23.\n\nWhat\u2019s up: The Warriors won four times \u2014 twice over Harden\u2019s Rockets \u2014 and Thompson got better each game. He averaged 32.0 points and made 56.8 percent of his shots. But it gets better. Thompson sizzled from the 3-point line, hitting 58.3 percent of his shots behind the arc. It gets even better. He was an extraordinary plus-26.3 for the week.\n\nBackground: Thompson\u2019s break- out game cleared the 50-point barrier. The Washington State product scored a career-high 52 points Friday night in Golden State\u2019s 126-101 victory over visiting Sacramento. Thompson set an NBA record for most points in a quarter, scoring 37 in the third. He was 13-of-13 from the field in that quarter, including nine 3-pointers. Overall he was 16-of-25 from the field, including 11-of-15 from the 3-point line, and found time to hand out five assists. He did all of that in just 32 minutes of playing time.\n\nDempsey\u2019s take: To review, that was 52 points in 32 minutes. Not much more needs to be said about that. There had been some debate about whether Thompson would be included on the all-star team as a reserve. There\u2019s no doubt now. The NBA\u2019s best team to this point will have at least two representatives in New York on Feb. 15.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "James Harden,Klay Thompson,NBA,Warriors", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "Nuggets Ink", "description": "Spotlight on Klay Thompson, the Golden State Warriors guard.", "title": "Klay Thompson: Spotlight on the Golden State Warriors guard", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/2015/01/25/klay-thompson-spotlight-golden-state-warriors-guard/12469/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/files/2015/01/klaythompson-495x342.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Spotlight on Klay Thompson, the Golden State Warriors guard.", "title": "Klay Thompson: Spotlight on the Golden State Warriors guard", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/2015/01/25/klay-thompson-spotlight-golden-state-warriors-guard/12469/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/files/2015/01/klaythompson-495x342.jpg", "creator": "@dempseyPost", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "language": "en, sv", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Spotlight on Klay Thompson, the Golden State Warriors guard."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd0c6\"", "article_summary": "What\u2019s up: The Warriors won four times \u2014 twice over Harden\u2019s Rockets \u2014 and Thompson got better each game.\nSpotlight on \u2026 Klay Thompson, guard, WarriorsWhen: His week was solid overall.\nThe Washington State product scored a career-high 52 points Friday night in Golden State\u2019s 126-101 victory over visiting Sacramento.\nThompson set an NBA record for most points in a quarter, scoring 37 in the third.\nThe NBA\u2019s best team to this point will have at least two representatives in New York on Feb. 15."}
