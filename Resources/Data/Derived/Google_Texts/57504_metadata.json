Tawny Willoughby, Facebook\n\nSometimes we don\u2019t stop destructive behaviors until it\u2019s too late. Tawny Willoughby, a skin cancer survivor who used a personal tanning bed four to five times a week as a teenager, has hopes a selfie can change that.\n\nWilloughby, 27, posted a photo recently to her Facebook page revealing the gruesome realities of treatment for basal cell carcinoma, the most common form of skin cancer. Willoughby\u2019s skin, once smooth and even, appears covered in scabs and sores, her smile replaced with a blank stare.\n\n\u201cIf anyone needs a little motivation to not lay in the tanning bed and sun here ya go!\u201d she wrote in the post, which has now been shared more than 50,000 times. The Alabama mom says she now uses her own story and the safety of her 2-year-old son as fuel to spread the word about skin safety, which, above all, includes regular sunscreen use.\n\nWilloughby was first diagnosed at the age of 21 and has had six more diagnoses since then, all of them but one basal cell carcinoma. The sixth was squamous cell carcinoma, another common form of the disease. Every six months, she says, she visits a dermatologist. She\u2019s thankful the doctor has never found a melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer.\n\n\u201cLearn from other people's mistakes,\u201d she wrote on Facebook. \u201cDon't let tanning prevent you from seeing your children grow up.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "womans, skin, cancer, selfie, reveals, dangers, frequent, tanning, need, sunscreen", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Tawny Willoughby went tanning five times a week as a teenager, and now she's revealing the price she paid.", "title": "Woman's Skin Cancer Selfie Shows How Dangerous Tanning Can Be [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/womans-skin-cancer-selfie-reveals-dangers-frequent-tanning-need-sunscreen-333144", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured/public/2015/05/13/tawnywilloughby.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Tawny Willoughby went tanning five times a week as a teenager, and now she's revealing the price she paid.", "title": "Woman's Skin Cancer Selfie Shows How Dangerous Tanning Can Be [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/womans-skin-cancer-selfie-reveals-dangers-frequent-tanning-need-sunscreen-333144", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured/public/2015/05/13/tawnywilloughby.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/05/13/tawnywilloughby.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-05-13T10:53:59-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-13T10:53:58-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Tawny Willoughby went tanning five times a week as a teenager, and now she's revealing the price she paid."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1ac4\"", "article_summary": "Tawny Willoughby went tanning five times a week as a teenager, and now she's revealing the price she paid.\nTawny Willoughby, a skin cancer survivor who used a personal tanning bed four to five times a week as a teenager, has hopes a selfie can change that.\nTawny Willoughby, FacebookSometimes we don\u2019t stop destructive behaviors until it\u2019s too late.\nShe\u2019s thankful the doctor has never found a melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer.\nWilloughby, 27, posted a photo recently to her Facebook page revealing the gruesome realities of treatment for basal cell carcinoma, the most common form of skin cancer."}
