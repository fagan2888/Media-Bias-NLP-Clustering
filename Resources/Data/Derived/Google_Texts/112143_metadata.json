Transthyertin is produced in the liver and certain brain regions. After years of research on the protein, scientists are finally discovering its anti-Alzheimer\u2019s properties, according to a new study conducted by Professor Joel N. Buxbaum, of the Scripps Research Institute, and colleagues.\n\nTTR began showing an ability to bind amyloid-beta, which is a protein found building up in the brains of people with Alzheimer\u2019s, and prevent it from clustering together to form clumps, in the 1990s. Scientists noted that if the protein really did prevent amyloids from building up, TTR would be a potential key to preventing Alzheimer\u2019s. \u201cAt the time it seemed unlikely that one amyloidogenic precursor would have a beneficial effect on the aggregation of another,\u201d Buxbaum told Medical News Today. \u201cThe in vitro experiments were technically suspect, but turned out to be essentially correct.\u201d\n\nDespite his skepticism, Buxbaum conducted a study in 2008 to test the Alzheimer\u2019s theory, and found that TTR actually did lessen the amount of aggregation of amyloid-beta in mice\u2019s brains and boosted their memory. \u201cGiven that background, I was predisposed to be skeptical,\u201d he told Medical News Today, \u201cwhich was probably a good thing since it made me look at the data from our genetic experiments very critically. I figured if the results convinced me, they should convince anyone.\u201d In a press release from 2008, Buxbaum notes that getting rid of the natural TTR protein in mice caused Alzheimer\u2019s disease to arrive earlier and more intensely; when they added the human TTR protein, the symptoms ceased to progress and their conditions improved.\n\nIn the new study, Buxbaum and co-authors Xin Wang and Francesca Cattaneo investigated TTR further, and found that certain \u201ctranscription factors\u201d could promote TTR production. \u201cThis result was completely unexpected when we started this research,\u201d Buxbaum said. \u201cBut now we realize that it could indicate a new approach for Alzheimer\u2019s prevention and therapy.\u201d There are some five million people in the U.S. who suffer from Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and this number is expected to increase to 16 million by 2050. As scientists attempt to find a cure or at least a treatment for the disease, Buxbaum hopes that his TTR research could eventually lead to a treatment in the form of a pill that would boost TTR production.\n\nSource: Wang X, Cattaneo F, Ryno L, Hulleman J, REixach N, Buxbaum J.
