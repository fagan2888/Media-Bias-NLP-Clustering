And my cliental then are really, are paying for that, which doesn\u2019t bring any direct benefit back.\u201d\n\n\n\nFoote notes that she\u2019s also concerned about the added cost of her existing health coverage under the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\n\nThe medical device tax is intended to bring in roughly $29 billion over the next decade to help pay for the health care law. Democrats and Republicans in Congress have supported repealing the tax, but an effort last year to do so failed in the Senate after passing in the House.", "article_metadata": {"category": "State News", "description": "Some veterinarians say the Affordable Care Acts 2.3-percent tax on medical devices is unfair.", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://peoriapublicradio.org/post/vets-speak-out-health-care-reform-tax", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wcbu/files/styles/medium/public/201310/Vets_img.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Some veterinarians say the Affordable Care Acts 2.3-percent tax on medical devices is unfair.", "title": "Vets speak out on health care reform tax"}, "org_id": 0, "twitter": {"site": "@WCBURadio", "card": "summary"}, "author": "Illinois Public Radio", "wordCount": 276, "dc": {"title": "Vets speak out on health care reform tax"}, "nid": 13388, "datePublished": "2013-10-14", "story_id": 234312321, "keywords": ", ,", "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "The medical device tax is intended to bring in roughly $29 billion over the next decade to help pay for the health care law.\nThat\u2019s because the tax applies to a lot of the same equipment used on humans and animals, but animals don\u2019t benefit from the health care law.\nSome veterinarians say the Affordable Care Act\u2019s 2.3-percent tax on medical devices is unfair.\nDr. Sally Foote, who\u2019s a veterinarian in Tuscola, says because of the tax, she\u2019s going to have to either see a lot more clients or raise the cost of service.\nDemocrats and Republicans in Congress have supported repealing the tax, but an effort last year to do so failed in the Senate after passing in the House."}
