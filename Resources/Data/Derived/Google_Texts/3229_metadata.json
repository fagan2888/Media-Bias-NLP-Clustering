Bill Haslam delivered his sixth State of the State speech Monday, upwards of 100 proponents of Insure Tennessee flocked to the Capitol to once again press the issue.\n\nAbout 100 pro-Insure Tennessee supporters chanting outside House chamber.

Gov. Ron Ramsey.\n\nAs lawmakers walk out of chamber here's the scene pic.twitter.com/sNzv95tlh5 \u2014 Joel Ebert (@joelebert29) February 2, 2016\n\nRamsey, who praised Haslam's agenda, calling it \"ambitious,\" said the demonstrators were within well their rights to express their opinions. \u201cThat\u2019s what democracy\u2019s all about,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we have to remember what\u2019s best for all Tennesseans.\u201d\n\nMore singing, chanting from Insure Tennessee supporters. @BillHaslam hasn't entered chamber yet pic.twitter.com/eLGciyaEsZ \u2014 Dave Boucher (@Dave_Boucher1) February 2, 2016\n\nRamsey once again reiterated the need for lawmakers to wait until after the November presidential election to address the issue.\n\nAfter Haslam concluded his speech, state Sen. Jeff Yarbro, D-Nashville, pointed to the crowd to reiterate that the issue was not going away.\n\n\u201cThe elephant in the room was what he didn\u2019t talk about. There was no mention of Insure Tennessee despite this huge crowd,\u201d Yarbro said.\n\nState Democratic Party Chairwoman Mary Mancini went further, saying that despite the fact that Republicans have a supermajority in both chambers, the governor\u2019s health insurance plan couldn\u2019t get out of committee during the 2015 session.\n\nHaslam's plan sought to use federal money made available through the Affordable Care Act to expand access to health insurance for low-income Tennesseans. But the effort gained little momentum in the legislature and was ultimately not adopted, despite being touted by the governor.\n\n\u201cEven worse, when the going gets tough, he gave up,\u201d Mancini said. \u201cHe could have brought back Insure Tennessee. He could have used his leadership to pass a health care plan that would have saved lives and created opportunity. Instead, he caved to the extremists in his party.\u201d\n\nMonday's gathering of Insure Tennessee supporters comes after they also assembled on the first day of the legislative session.\n\nDave Boucher contributed to this report.\n\nReach Joel Ebert at 615-259-8379 and on Twitter @joelebert29.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://tnne.ws/1WZSRMc", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Upwards of 100 proponents of Insure Tennessee flocked to the Capitol to once again press the issue.", "og": {"site_name": "The Tennessean", "description": "Upwards of 100 proponents of Insure Tennessee flocked to the Capitol to once again press the issue.", "title": "Insure Tennessee: State of the State's 'elephant in the room'", "url": "http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/politics/2016/02/02/insure-tennessee-state-states-elephant-room/79674698/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/tennessean.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Upwards of 100 proponents of Insure Tennessee flocked to the Capitol to once again press the issue.", "creator": "@tennessean", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d12dcab8829eb0a232b11ad304b0f3e035e326bb/c=499-0-2501-2002&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/02/01/Nashville/Nashville/635899557362573318-NAS-State-of-the-State-gallery-015.jpg", "title": "Insure Tennessee: State of the State's 'elephant in the room'", "site": "@tennessean", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600028886", "fb": {"app_id": 121487414583460}, "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Subjects/Politics", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Subjects/Politics", "title": "Insure Tennessee: State of the State's 'elephant in the room'", "author": "Joel Ebert", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/politics", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/88d55936ee4c9fd1f19289fd46f7b6c53c63708e/c=618-0-2120-2002/local/-/media/2016/02/01/Nashville/Nashville/635899557362573318-NAS-State-of-the-State-gallery-015.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1c11a10c60493676b78ac18218e9072b569c25a9/c=499-0-2501-2002/local/-/media/2016/02/01/Nashville/Nashville/635899557362573318-NAS-State-of-the-State-gallery-015.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ffbb45680f9b556132a55dca13c1c6a7e6684224/c=138-0-2801-2002/local/-/media/2016/02/01/Nashville/Nashville/635899557362573318-NAS-State-of-the-State-gallery-015.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/42fe00d83d2d96313d5b9598fe175fb265b6a271/c=0-278-2999-1972&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2016/02/01/Nashville/Nashville/635899557362573318-NAS-State-of-the-State-gallery-015.jpg", "publishtime": "2016-02-02T07:00:58.863000-06:00", "shorthed": "Advocates still push Insure Tennessee", "articleid": 79674698, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7f2a45512ccac89aea423471c765785ddabc0709/c=0-278-2999-1972/local/-/media/2016/02/01/Nashville/Nashville/635899557362573318-NAS-State-of-the-State-gallery-015.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8f3f762360de2aa5bd1fb988a89fad335f765420/c=630-0-1751-2002/local/-/media/2016/02/01/Nashville/Nashville/635899557362573318-NAS-State-of-the-State-gallery-015.jpg"}}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "Gov.
