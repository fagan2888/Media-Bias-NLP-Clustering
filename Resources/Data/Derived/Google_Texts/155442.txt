After Trump asked Brown whether he would consider running for public office again, a member of the audience floated the idea of a Trump-Brown ticket in 2016.

ADVERTISEMENT “Vice president – hey, that sounds like it could, hey, hey, very good,” Trump responded.

“Hey, you know what? And he’s central casting. Look at that guy. Central casting,” he added. “He’s great. Great guy and a great, beautiful, great wife and family. So important.”

Brown hosted Trump in the Granite State as a part of his “No BS Backyard BBQ” series. He will also hold a rally with Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) this weekend.

The former Massachusetts senator relocated to New Hampshire to challenge incumbent Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) for her seat in 2014, but lost in a close race.

He won a special election in 2010 to succeed former Sen. Ted Kennedy, who passed away in office, but was ousted by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) in 2012.
