Under the federal health law, most Americans will be required to have health insurance coverage by Jan. 1, 2014, or they'll face a tax penalty.\n\nIdaho's state-run exchange will offer 146 insurance plans from seven different companies. The Idaho Statesman reports roughly 190,000 uninsured Idahoans will be eligible for health insurance through the online marketplace.
