That number is expected to double as the Quinn administration mandates that half of the state's roughly 3 million Medicaid recipients enroll in a managed care plan of some form by year-end.\n\nCook County Health previously planned to sell an HMO product for the enrollment period that begins Nov. 15, the second year of the exchanges nationwide created under the Affordable Care Act. Instead, the health system is eyeing 2016, Mr. Glass said.\n\n\u201cIt became just so apparent once we really understood the state's implementation and the state's process for moving toward managed care that that had to be our focus,\u201d Mr. Glass said.\n\nCook County Health is among the largest public health systems in the country, with a roughly $1 billion budget, and it treats a predominantly poor and uninsured population. The system includes John H. Stroger Jr. Hospital on the Near West Side, Provident Hospital on the South Side and several clinics.\n\nIn 2013, former Cook County Health CEO Dr. Ramanathan Raju said he wanted to sell an insurance product on the state exchange. Selling insurance and launching CountyCare in 2012 were two of Dr. Raju's ambitious ideas to help the health system become more financially independent and rely less on taxpayers to stay afloat.\n\nMany CountyCare enrollees are insured for the first time, which means Cook County Health is getting paid for their treatment instead of having to subsidize it as charity care. But costs have climbed quickly, as newly insured patients have sought everything from checkups to pricey treatment for chronic ailments.\n\nDr. Raju left the health system in March to lead the New York City Health & Hospitals Corp., where he was chief operating officer before coming to Cook County Health in 2011 as CEO.\n\nOne barrier for Cook County to sell an HMO health plan was removed earlier this year, when the state broadened the definition of an organization that can operate an HMO to include a \u201cunit of local government health system\u201d operating in a county with at least 3 million residents. Previously, only insurance companies, nonprofits that were doing business only as HMOs and the University of Illinois Hospital could operate an HMO.\n\nThe deadline to submit proposed plans to sell on the exchange had already passed before the law expanded what entities could operate an HMO.\n\nCook County Health has yet to apply for an HMO license with the Illinois Department of Insurance, Mr. Glass said.", "article_metadata": {"byline": "Kristen Schorsch", "timeCrawled": "20160525_07:24:08", "categoryName": "CCB - Health Care", "published_at": "2014-8-15", "title": "Cook County Health puts brakes on plan to sell HMO on Get Covered Illinois", "url": "http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article//NEWS03/140819903", "twitter": {"image": "http://www.chicagobusiness.com/images/logo-square-200x200.png", "site": "@CrainsChicago", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Cook County Health puts brakes on plan to sell HMO on Get Covered Illinois"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#2d89ef", "og": {"site_name": "Crain's Chicago Business", "description": "The Cook County Health and Hospitals System is shelving plans for at least a year to sell an HMO product on the Illinois health insurance exchange.", "title": "Cook County Health puts brakes on plan to sell HMO on Obamacare exchange", "url": "http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20140815/NEWS03/140819903/cook-county-health-puts-brakes-on-plan-to-sell-hmo-on-obamacare-exchange", "image": "http://www.chicagobusiness.com/images/logo-square-200x200.png", "type": "article"}, "summary": "The Cook County Health and Hospitals System is shelving plans for at least a year to sell an HMO product on the Illinois health insurance exchange.", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=571426684", "fb": {"admins": 100001125868754}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/assets/icons/mstile-144x144.png", "content_type": "article", "taxo_Companies": "University of Illinois", "google-site-verification": "0QcjJi4OGS9bKu4FBKK58V93fKv0WYCQb7IFbmjATew", "taxo_People": "Ramanathan Raju", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimal-ui", "description": "Visit Crain's Chicago Business for complete business news and analysis including healthcare, real estate, manufacturing, government, sports and more."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9b6e\"", "article_summary": "The Cook County Health and Hospitals System is shelving plans for at least a year to sell an HMO product on the Illinois health insurance exchange.\nCook County Health has yet to apply for an HMO license with the Illinois Department of Insurance, Mr. Glass said.\nCook County Health is among the largest public health systems in the country, with a roughly $1 billion budget, and it treats a predominantly poor and uninsured population.\nDr. Raju left the health system in March to lead the New York City Health & Hospitals Corp., where he was chief operating officer before coming to Cook County Health in 2011 as CEO.\nIn 2013, former Cook County Health CEO Dr. Ramanathan Raju said he wanted to sell an insurance product on the state exchange."}
