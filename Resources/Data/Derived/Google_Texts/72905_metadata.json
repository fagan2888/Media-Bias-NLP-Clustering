That number was 1,405 earlier this month.\n\nInsurance agents who connect small firms with coverage say several factors are at play, including a MNsure system they call slow and cumbersome. Steps that still can\u2019t be done online are burdensome.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have that kind of time,\u201d said Sheryl Frieman, an agent with Array Insurance in Golden Valley who calls herself a supporter of the federal health law. \u201cIf I don\u2019t use it, no one is going to use it.\u201d\n\nMinnesota created the MNsure exchange in 2013 to implement the Affordable Care Act, which called for new government-run health insurance marketplaces in all 50 states.\n\nWith its troubled launch in late 2013, the Minnesota exchange opted to first fix technical problems for individual users. The system is better now, but still needs significant work for people enrolling in public health insurance through MNsure.\n\nThose groups have alternatives for obtaining coverage, but MNsure says it has a plan to grow small business enrollment.\n\n\u201cWe agree that [enrollment is] modest at this point, but there\u2019s opportunity for growth,\u201d said Katie Burns, the MNsure chief operating officer.\n\nJon Gabel, a health policy researcher at the University of Chicago, says other states are struggling with similar issues.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve got to get broker buy-in,\u201d Gabel said. \u201cFrom our surveys, maybe 35 percent or so of small employers are aware of the [exchanges], and it\u2019s similar for the tax credits.\u201d\n\nMost of the attention on exchanges has focused on marketplaces for individuals, who can tap sizable tax credits when buying non-group coverage on an exchange.\n\nBut the health law also created the Small Business Health Options Program \u2014 called SHOP for short \u2014 to improve the insurance market for firms with 50 or fewer employees.\n\nWhereas almost all employers with 1,000 or more workers offer health insurance, the rate is less than 50 percent among small groups \u2014 and the gap is widening.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a broad concern about deterioration and declining participation among smaller employers, and it is fundamentally related to market leverage \u2014 they don\u2019t have the market leverage to command the best deals in the marketplace,\u201d said Joel Ario, managing director with Manatt Health Solutions and previously the top Obama administration official for developing health exchanges.\n\nIn April, the trade group for Minnesota\u2019s nonprofit health insurers reported that the number of people covered through small group plans dropped by more than 16 percent in 2014, the steepest year-over-year decline in a decade.\n\nThe decline apparently didn\u2019t boost the state\u2019s uninsured rate, which fell to about 5 percent last year. Small groups that dropped health plans tended to direct workers to the non-group market, insurers said.\n\nSmall group plans covered 289,590 people in the state last year, according to the Minnesota Council of Health Plans, which means the MNsure share was less than 1 percent.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the case that a broker can go in and do the entire enrollment process online for the small employer,\u201d said MNsure\u2019s Burns. \u201dThere are pieces of it that need to be done offline.\u201d\n\nIn the coming year, MNsure expects to put more resources into publicizing the program for small businesses, Burns said. Starting next year, the definition for eligible small groups should increase to those with 51 to 100 workers \u2014 potentially expanding the pool of firms shopping through the exchange.\n\nSmall businesses buying through MNsure can let workers select from all health plan options being sold through the government-run marketplace, Burns said. Traditionally, workers in small group plans haven\u2019t had many choices in coverage.\n\nBut even with those selling points, Burns acknowledged repeated complaints from insurance agents. The exchange has had to focus resources, she said, on people who use the exchange for non-group coverage.\n\nIn November, the U.S. Government Accountability Office examined enrollment through SHOP exchanges in 18 states and concluded that sign-ups have been \u201csignificantly lower than expected.\u201d\n\nAcross the country, many SHOP exchanges have ongoing technical challenges and administrative burdens that discourage agents from recommending the marketplaces to small business clients, according to GAO. Stakeholders told the government that tax credits available for small groups buying on SHOP exchanges aren\u2019t providing a big enough incentive.\n\n\u201cThose tax credits are so nebulous,\u201d said Dave Wiest, president of EMEX Benefits, an insurance agency in Medina. \u201cThey\u2019re hard to get. And when they\u2019re available, they\u2019re so low they\u2019re all but useless.\u201d\n\nProjections presented to the Legislature in early 2013 had forecast 155,000 people covered through small group policies purchased on MNsure by 2016. Those sign-ups were part of a projected 452,000 commercial enrollees buying through the exchange by next year.\n\nAs of mid-May, 64,000 people had signed up private insurance policies through the exchange, including 1,405 people in SHOP policies. MNsure now expects 95,000 commercial enrollees by the end of 2016 \u2014 a reduction that has forced cuts in operating costs, because the exchange is funded by withholding a portion of premium revenue.\n\nRepublicans at the Capitol have seized on the enrollment numbers, questioning MNsure\u2019s sustainability. Earlier this month, lawmakers directed the state to develop a proposal so small businesses could obtain tax credits when buying coverage outside MNsure.\n\nWhen Gov. Mark Dayton launched a task force in 2011 to develop plans for an exchange in Minnesota, Dan Schmidt was one of the key representatives for small businesses.\n\nThe new marketplace promised small groups the chance to easily see the cost of coverage from competing carriers, Schmidt said. But more than a year after MNsure\u2019s launch, he\u2019s stayed with his insurance agent and stayed out of the SHOP exchange.\n\n\u201cThey left the brokers out on a limb,\u201d said Schmidt, who is vice president with Great River Office Products in St. Paul. \u201cThey didn\u2019t incorporate them as a resource into MNsure itself.\u201d\n\nThe lack of broker buy-in and burdensome enrollment processes are \u201cmajor impediments to success\u201d for many small business exchanges, according to a recent HealthAffairs study published in part by Gabel of the University of Chicago. The study noted that brokers may view the SHOPs as \u201cbusiness and political adversaries.\u201d\n\nThe employee choice features offered by government-run exchanges have become less of a selling point, Gabel said in an interview, with the rise of private exchanges that offer similar services. Plus, fewer carriers have been selling small group policies on exchanges compared with off-exchange markets.\n\nDespite the challenges, Gabel said it\u2019s too early to write an obituary for the SHOPs.\n\n\u201cWhen innovations in health insurance begin, change is not instantaneous,\u201d Gabel said. \u201cIt takes a long time.\u201d\n\nTwitter: @chrissnowbeck", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "MNsure has missed big on one of its original selling points: getting more small businesses to offer insurance to employees.", "title": "For MNsure, attracting small businesses is a big problem", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/for-mnsure-attracting-small-businesses-is-a-big-problem/304874401/", "image": {"url": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201858", "width": 1680, "identifier": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201858", "height": 876}, "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "twitter": {"description": "MNsure has missed big on one of its original selling points: getting more small businesses to offer insurance to employees.", "title": "For MNsure, attracting small businesses is a big problem", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/for-mnsure-attracting-small-businesses-is-a-big-problem/304874401/", "image": {"src": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201858", "identifier": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201858"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "description": "MNsure has missed big on one of its original selling points: getting more small businesses to offer insurance to employees."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8669\"", "article_summary": "The government-run marketplace was expected to cover 155,000 people in small group plans by next year.\nStakeholders told the government that tax credits available for small groups buying on SHOP exchanges aren\u2019t providing a big enough incentive.\nMNsure has missed big on one of its original selling points: getting more small businesses to offer insurance to employees.\nThe new marketplace promised small groups the chance to easily see the cost of coverage from competing carriers, Schmidt said.\nThe system is better now, but still needs significant work for people enrolling in public health insurance through MNsure."}
