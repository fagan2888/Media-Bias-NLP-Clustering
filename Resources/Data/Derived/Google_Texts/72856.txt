Photos released Monday capture a meeting between Richard Martinez — father of Christopher Martinez, a victim of the Isla Vista massacre — and Peter Rodger — father of believed Isla Vista shooter Elliot Rodger. The two fathers said that they would prefer to keep what they discussed private, but have continued to channel their grief into calls for gun reform and said they hope “other families won’t have to suffer as they both did.”
