Usually, the actual results of their program will be the exact opposite of whatever its title implies. The \u201cAffordable Care Act,\u201d for instance, increased premiums by an average of 49 percent. The \u201cAmerican Recovery and Reinvestment Act\u201d wasted half a trillion dollars and certainly didn\u2019t produce a recovery.\n\nNow we have a new Orwellian euphemism to add to the list: the 841 page \u201cgainful employment\u201d regulation, which will kill jobs and destroy opportunities for working adults to advance in their careers.\n\nWith the gainful employment regulation, the Department of Education would disqualify any program offered by a for-profit college from accepting student loans if its graduates, on average, have monthly student loan payments in excess of 8 percent of their monthly income. The regulation also sets a threshold on the percentage of students who can default on their loans.\n\nWhile the regulation would also apply to certificate programs offered by non-profit institutions, it would apply to all programs \u2013 from certificate through doctoral \u2013 offered by for-profit schools.\n\nThis move is clearly designed to put for-profit colleges out of business. The truth is that few institutions in the country \u2014 whether public, for-profit, or \u201cnon-profit\u201d \u2014 could meet the gainful employment regulation\u2019s arbitrary standards. The average 4-year public school would fail, with students graduating with a 12 percent debt-to-earnings ratio. So would the average for-profit, with a 13 percent ratio. And private non-profits would fail worst of all, with a 16 percent ratio (twice the proposed standard). In fact, about half of all student borrowers nationwide do not meet the requirement.\n\nThis unfair and unequal treatment from the Obama administration is unsurprising considering the long-standing hostility to for-profit schools from the traditional education establishment.\n\nIf it was actually a good idea for the federal government to hold colleges and universities accountable for the earnings of their alumni, the administration would want to apply the regulation to every school. The fact that it applies almost exclusively to career-focused, private sector colleges shows the regulation is less about protecting students than it is about satisfying an ideological grudge.\n\nIt is even worse when you consider whom the rule will most harm. Nearly 3.4 million students would be denied access to the career enhancement programs of their choice through the end of the decade. This includes over 630,000 African Americans, 623,000 Hispanics and 209,000 veterans. It also includes more than 1.8 million low income Americans \u2013 precisely those who need to borrow more money to finance their education, and thus have more debt when they graduate.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Newt Gingrich", "description": "Private non-profit schools and public schools would all fail the 'gainful employment' test too.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "One of the best ways to predict the effect of a proposal for more bureaucracy in Washington is to consider the name its proponents give it.
