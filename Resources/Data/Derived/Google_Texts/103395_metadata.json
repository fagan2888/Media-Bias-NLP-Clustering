The spirit of Ilocandia joined us that night as medicinally ingesting cognac, to keep our feet warm as we yearn for that Marcos Era of hope and redemption, universal acceptance and recognition.\n\nWe were inspired to top one another with story after story of such days of freedom fighting and fun making. Ilocanos revered the late President Ferdinand Marcos because he was quite simply a great man, because of his courage, his integrity, love of country and his legacy.\n\nBBM-USA Chair Ferandico Gonong Jr. led the movement from then on.\n\nIn a calmer light of day, it occurred to us, brethren and sistren in this trade that indeed, our beloved Sen. Bongbong Marcos can start a career, any career. There is not the slightest difficulty getting started. Everyone wants him, his name is Marcos.\n\nThe disadvantages are equally remarkable\u2014people expect a lot from him; in fact, too much. He must be good because if he is not, he takes umbrage. If he is good, people take it for granted, whether it\u2019s his credit or due to his name, whether he succeeds or not\u2014it\u2019s because of his inherited surname.\n\nYou only have to look at his everyday load: what the senator has done and accomplished to know how proud of him his supporters are.\n\nNow, who is Chairman Fernandico Gonong Jr.? We already know that he founded the BBM-USA with his own fortune. Why are sterling things said about him? Why did he choose to start the little suppressed flames into a conflagration about Sen. Bongbong\u2019s plans and goal? What made him choose and lead the Fil-Ams here in the US at a time when politics not only has already reared its ugly head but is now blood sport?\n\n\u201cSenator Marcos has spent a lifetime in and around politics. Frankly, he burns with ambition\u2014yearning to make his mark. He never behaved selfishly to do so,\u201d said Gonong.\n\n\u201cMany men with ambition are willing to step on and even trample over others in their climb, but Sen. Marcos never did that! He had great ambition, but he never wronged anyone in order to get ahead. We love him most, for what he hated: injustice, bigotry, pompously, snobbery and hypocrisy.\u201d\n\nBBM-USA Chairman Gonong\u2019s motto: Do right and risk the consequences.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Lifestyle", "description": "A FEW Ilocanos together gathered one Tuesday night, around six until over just before midnight, while the hardcore stayed up till 2 am.
