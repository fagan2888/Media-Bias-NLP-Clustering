Simply gathering this publicly available information and developing a visualization for it allowed The Guardian to provide its audience with an authentic story.\n\nThe new frontier of data journalism is helping journalists and bloggers create compelling stories. In an interview for theCUBE at the Tableau Conference last week, Tableau Software, Inc. Senior Product Marketing Manager Ben Jones discussed the rise of data journalism and why he believes it\u2019s going to become just another part of the way journalists do their work.\n\nData journalism has actually been around for a while, but the difference now is the fact that there\u2019s a lot more data. Tools, like Tableau, are making it easier and easier for journalists to use it in order to create a convincing point.\n\nJones said that some newsrooms have a team of data specialists that pair up with reporters to develop interactive graphics. Now, with Tableau being so easy to use, individual journalists and bloggers are creating their own visualizations and even finding a story based a data discovery itself. Jones mentioned Sarah Ryley at the New York Daily News as an example for this. Tableau worked with her to create a visualization for a story on arrests for transit fare evasion.\n\nAnother use case of data visualization in journalism was around ObamaCare. There was a time when data around this subject wasn\u2019t easy to find. As a workaround, journalists started to look at social sentiment. Alabama Media Group data journalist Alex Walsh created a visualization on a survey in which the majority of respondents gave a negative review of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nJones also worked with ProPublica Assistant Managing Editor and top data journalist Scott Klein to introduce interactive data to students at New School University in New York City. He stated that the students really took to it and had fun interacting with the data. \u201cI think there\u2019s a new wave of journalists coming in that are really going to find this to be an activity that\u2019s not as intimidating,\u201d said Jones.\n\nAmongst complaints about content mills and the lack of source material, data has become a real bright spot for good journalism. In the past, video and photo journalism were just buzz words. Now, they\u2019re just integrated into the way stories are presented. Regarding interactive data, Jones believes, \u201cYou\u2019re just going to start to see in the years down the road that\u2019s just kind of expected to be a way to articulate a point. And, hopefully, what will follow there is an increase in the numerical literacy of the population.\u201d\n\nphoto credit: Alan Cleaver via photopin cc", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "SiliconANGLE", "description": "After the Boston Marathon bombing last year, UK-based publication The Guardian created one of the more positive sides of the story using data mined from Boston.", "title": "Journalists no longer need experts for data visualization | #data14", "url": "http://siliconangle.com/blog/2014/09/15/journalists-no-longer-need-experts-for-data-visualization-data14/", "image": "http://siliconangle.com/files/2014/09/writer-author-writing-pencil-inspiration-typography-text-pencil-shaving-sharpen-pencil-writers-block-journalist--300x201.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 711590948984388}, "generator": "WordPress 4.2.4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf52f\"", "article_summary": "Data journalism has actually been around for a while, but the difference now is the fact that there\u2019s a lot more data.\nThe new frontier of data journalism is helping journalists and bloggers create compelling stories.\nAnother use case of data visualization in journalism was around ObamaCare.\nJones also worked with ProPublica Assistant Managing Editor and top data journalist Scott Klein to introduce interactive data to students at New School University in New York City.\nRegarding interactive data, Jones believes, \u201cYou\u2019re just going to start to see in the years down the road that\u2019s just kind of expected to be a way to articulate a point."}
