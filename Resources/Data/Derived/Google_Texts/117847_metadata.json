Sandene won't give the exact amount, but says Sanford has asked for a rate increase in the low teens. Sanford says it's also looking for other way to offset healthcare costs.\n\n\"We can't just always be increasing rates. We have to look at how can we manage the population; how can we keep people healthy?\" Sandene said.\n\nAvera Health Plans has 13,000 ACA members in South Dakota. It also says it's asking for a rate hike in the low teens. Health insurance rate increase requests are now before the state division of insurance and will be released in July to go into effect in 2016.\n\nDAKOTACARE has 10,000 ACA Members in the state. It's not releasing its 2016 rate request to the South Dakota Division of Insurance.\n\nBusiness\n\nYour Money Matters {{Title}} Remove Change News General Courts Web Only Crime Outdoors Events Center Non-Homepage Boredom Busters Pipeline Positively KELOLAND Technology Hunger Affordable Care Act Shops Flooding Remembering 9/11 Drought JazzFest Spring Storm Honor Flight Spencer Anniversary\n\nDoApp Health News Business News Sports\n\nAgriculture Markets Livestock Crops Politics\n\nHealthBeat Cancer Children's Health Heart Health Wellness & Nutrition General Health Beat Women's Health RX Resources What's Going Around OTC Diabetes Recalls Dental Health Men's Health\n\nPolitics South Dakota Legislature Budget Congress Taxes General Local Campaign President US Senate New Laws US House Iowa Ballot Issues Local Races Minnesota Gubernatorial\n\nEducation Funding College Elementary High School Pre K School Supplies Middle School\n\nSports Professional College High School Sports Zone Headlines Summit League Tournament Olympics\n\nBusiness Industry Your Money Matters Development Gas & Energy Legislation Economy/Stocks Employment General Health Care Technology Education Funding Tourism Banking/Finance Housing Transportation Insurance Meetings & Events Retail & Restaurants All Industries On The Move Shops Agriculture\n\nFeatured Stories Eye on KELOLAND Inside KELOLAND\n\nWeather Snow Forecast Records Rain Flooding Drought WX Corner General\n\nWorld News\n\nInvestigates GEAR UP\n\nSponsored Done\n\n\u00a9 2016 KELOLAND TV.
