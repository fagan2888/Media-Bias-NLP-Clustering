If they fail to secure coverage, they will face a fine of $95 a year, or 1% of their annual income for failing to comply.\n\nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT\n\nWith a little more than five weeks left until the end of open enrollment, it\u2019s no surprise the administration is casually resetting expectations, says Larry Kocot, visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution.\n\n\u201cThis is a soft message to recalibrate expectations,\u201d Kocot says. \u201cIf they can move the number down, they can revise [ahead of the enrollment period deadline]. The real question is who are these people\u2014how do they impact risk pools?\u201d\n\n\u2018Enrollment Crash\u2019\n\nOne of the key areas of debate about the enrollee pool under the ACA has been how many of the enrollees have actually paid their premiums.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services is defining enrollments among those who have \u201cselected\u201d plans, meaning they may or may not have yet paid their first month\u2019s premiums.\n\nTraditionally the insurance industry counts people as enrolled once they make the final step in paying their premium.\n\nThe New York Times reports that one-fifth of the enrollees have yet to make that premium payment as of last week, and Bob Laszewski, who writes the Health Care Policy and Marketplace Blog, wrote on Feb. 7 that industry sources report 80% of new enrollees have made their first month\u2019s payment.\n\nSam Baker of the National Journal, called the lack of payments an \u201cenrollment crash\u201d and says the Obama Administration may eventually have to revise its enrollment stats down.\n\nKocot says enrollment data is a rolling report, with insurance companies reporting new stats to HHS on a monthly basis. \u201cThey won\u2019t revise midstream; they\u2019ll wait until they have actual data at the end of March or early April,\u201d he says.\n\nBut getting the demographics of who actually has made payments is an entirely separate issue, says Vishnu Lekraj, senior insurance analyst for Morningstar.\n\n\u201cYoung people do pay their premiums from what I know\u2014they aren\u2019t necessarily paying late\u201d Lekraj says. \u201cThe number of young folks in the exchanges now should increase by the end of March. But if they pay their premiums or not is another story\u2014usually they do.\u201d\n\nBut premium payments also have to be consistent, argues Devon Herrick, senior analyst at the National Center for Policy Analysis. Technically, an enrollee can make his or her first month\u2019s payment, and then not make a payment for up to 90 days before an insurance company can remove him or her from their coverage plans.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just making the first payment\u2014its making the second and third,\u201d he says. \u201cWe won\u2019t have any official work on that for at least three to five months. Insurance companies may let that trickle out, if people who signed up didn\u2019t follow through.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.modified": "2016-01-07 11:24:17 EST", "dcterms.abstract": "So much of the success of the president\u2019s signature health-care reform rests on the shoulders of young enrollees singing up for coverage, and now that number is getting even more murky.", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.foxbusiness.com/features/2014/02/20/bidens-aca-enrollment-confession-whats-next.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/media.foxbusiness.com/thumbnails/022014/0/0/022014_fbn_kateenrollment.jpg?ve=1", "description": "So much of the success of the president\u2019s signature health-care reform rests on the shoulders of young enrollees singing up for coverage, and now that number is getting even more murky.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Biden\u2019s ACA Enrollment Confession: What\u2019s Next?"}, "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.publisher": "Fox Business", "parsely-metadata": "{\"author\":\"Kate Rogers\",\"subSection\":\"features\",\"title\":\"Biden\\u2019s ACA Enrollment Confession: What\\u2019s Next?\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/media.foxbusiness.com/thumbnails/022014/0/0/022014_fbn_kateenrollment.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-02-20T19:29:20Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxbusiness.com/features/2014/02/20/bidens-aca-enrollment-confession-whats-next.html\",\"type\":\"article\",\"identifier\":\"b66b1ae9-f68f-4261-9cb4-bd79062f74f0\",\"section\":\"features\"}", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "prism.channel": "fbn", "dc.description": "So much of the success of the president\u2019s signature health-care reform rests on the shoulders of young enrollees singing up for coverage, and now that number is getting even more murky.", "dc.identifier": "b66b1ae9-f68f-4261-9cb4-bd79062f74f0", "dc.language": "en-US", "pagetype": "article", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://global.fncstatic.com/static/cq/fb/img/all/mediumtile.png", "description": "So much of the success of the president\u2019s signature health-care reform rests on the shoulders of young enrollees singing up for coverage, and now that number is getting even more murky.", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://global.fncstatic.com/static/cq/fb/img/all/widetile.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://global.fncstatic.com/static/cq/fb/img/all/smalltile.png", "prism.section": "features", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://global.fncstatic.com/static/cq/fb/img/all/largetile.png", "fb": {"app_id": 116027085089150}, "dc.source": "FOXBusiness", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "dc.title": "Biden\u2019s Aca Enrollment Confession: What\u2019s Next?", "dcterms.created": "2016-01-07 11:24:17 EST", "og": {"site_name": "Fox Business", "description": "So much of the success of the president\u2019s signature health-care reform rests on the shoulders of young enrollees singing up for coverage, and now that number is getting even more murky.", "title": "Biden\u2019s ACA Enrollment Confession: What\u2019s Next? | Fox Business", "url": "http://www.foxbusiness.com/features/2014/02/20/bidens-aca-enrollment-confession-whats-next.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/media.foxbusiness.com/thumbnails/022014/0/0/022014_fbn_kateenrollment.jpg?ve=1", "type": "article"}, "dc.type": "Text.Article", "dc.date": "2014-02-20", "parsely-page": "{\"author\":\"Kate Rogers\",\"subSection\":\"features\",\"title\":\"Biden\\u2019s ACA Enrollment Confession: What\\u2019s Next?\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/media.foxbusiness.com/thumbnails/022014/0/0/022014_fbn_kateenrollment.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-02-20T19:29:20Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxbusiness.com/features/2014/02/20/bidens-aca-enrollment-confession-whats-next.html\",\"post_id\":\"b66b1ae9-f68f-4261-9cb4-bd79062f74f0\",\"type\":\"article\",\"section\":\"features\"}", "dc.creator": "Kate Rogers"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb832\"", "article_summary": "Under the ACA, every individual in the country has to have insurance by the end of open enrollment period.\nAlmost two weeks ago, the Congressional Budget Office revised its initial projections down to 6 million enrollees from 7 million in year one of the law.\n\u201cIf they can move the number down, they can revise [ahead of the enrollment period deadline].\nVice President Joe Biden confirmed Wednesday what analysts and insiders have long predicted about the Affordable Care Act\u2019s first open enrollment season: the numbers will most likely fall short of original White House expectations.\nSam Baker of the National Journal, called the lack of payments an \u201cenrollment crash\u201d and says the Obama Administration may eventually have to revise its enrollment stats down."}
