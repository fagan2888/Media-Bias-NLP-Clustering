He was a fresh voice, the man most able to save the GOP from the dolts destroying it. But then something happened: Jindal decided that intellectual integrity was a political liability. He abandoned any pretense of serious governance, and began appealing to the basest elements of his party. He has since become a caricature of himself, a pandering hack with no moral compass and even less political intuition. So what happened? How did the man who decried his party for being too stupid become the dumbest of them all?\n\nJindal\u2019s descent began in 2008. A young and promising governor, he attracted national attention, and for good reason. He was smart, competent and full of earnest ambition. Despite his bumbling response to Obama\u2019s State of the Union speech, he became a rising star in the Republican Party. And that\u2019s when things began to change.\n\nFrom 2009 on, Jindal has steadily debased himself for right-wing votes. He\u2019s run Louisiana into the ground and spent most of his time fellating conservatives across the country with gaseous stump speeches and childish Op-Ed pieces. Since becoming the GOP\u2019s golden boy, he has thought of nothing beyond his national conservative brand. Instead of reforming the stupid party, he\u2019s encouraged it.\n\nAs governor of Louisiana, Jindal has attached himself to every regressive, anti-intellectual cause imaginable, and for purely political reasons. The man is an Ivy-educated biology major. He was even accepted into Harvard Medical School at one point. And yet he signed and supported the Louisiana Science Education Act, which allows science teachers to teach creationism in public schools. Jindal knows creationism is a farce, and he knows it\u2019s a tremendous stain on Louisiana\u2019s reputation to allow it to be taught in science classes. But he doesn\u2019t give a damn. He wasn\u2019t concerned with Louisiana\u2019s future; he was signaling his conservative credentials to voters in Iowa and New Hampshire; appearing smart to stupid people was a strategic decision on his part.\n\nJindal reached peak stupid in January 2015, when he staged a massive prayerapooloza in Louisiana. Modeled after Rick Perry\u2019s 2011 prayer rally, it was a pathetic attempt to gin up support for his presidential campaign. The event itself was an orgy of bigotry and religious demagoguery. Here\u2019s a passage drawn directly from the rally materials:\n\n\u201cWe have watched sin escalate to a proportion the nation has never seen before. We live in the first generation in which\u2026homosexuality has been embraced\u2026While the United States still claims to be a nation \u2018under God\u2019 it is obvious that we have greatly strayed from our foundations in Christianity. This year we have seen a dramatic increase in tornadoes that have taken the lives of many\u2026and let us not forget that we are only six years from the tragic events of Hurricane Katrina\u2026\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Governor who urged GOP not to become \"stupid party\" now fans hate, spouts nonsense.
