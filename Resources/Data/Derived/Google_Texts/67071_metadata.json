A drive-thru offering a broad menu and car hop service, the restaurant was very different from the thousands of McDonald\u2019s that have been serving up burgers under the now-ubiquitous Golden Arches for decades \u2014 the menu originally featured potato chips, and french fries apparently didn\u2019t get added until 1949, for example.\n\nThe company\u2019s website now points to the 1948 reopening of the original location as the founding of McDonald\u2019s. Onetime milkshake machine salesman Ray Kroc didn\u2019t open his first McDonald\u2019s until several years later, and the company has celebrated that date \u2014 April 15, 1955 \u2014 as its anniversary. But the franchised fast-food behemoth Kroc would go on to build undeniably got its start with the McDonald brothers\u2019 drive-in 75 years ago. (That location is now home to a McDonald\u2019s-themed museum).\n\nThe chain, beset by criticism of its high-calorie offerings and low wages, may be struggling to turn around slumping sales these days as consumers increasingly opt for fresher, healthier options. (Free tip: the creepy new hipster Hamburglar really isn\u2019t helping.) But its burgers-and-fries empire remains a global force, far bigger than any competitor.
