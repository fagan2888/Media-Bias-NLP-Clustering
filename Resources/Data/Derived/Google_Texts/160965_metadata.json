That saves the companies from having to build out their own infrastructure like cell towers or fiber optic cables to reach remote areas.\n\nRelated: Google's YouTube to launch subscription music service in 'few months'\n\nGoogle has already run tests with several different telcos \u2014 Vodafone in New Zealand, Telstra in Australia, and Telefonica in Latin America \u2014 and is working on commercial deals with other new network operators.\n\nGoogle will split the revenue from any new customers with the telecommunications company providing the LTE spectrum.\n\nHere's how Project Loon lead Mike Cassidy describes it to The Verge:\n\n\"Think about it \u2014 with 4.5 billion people without internet access, take 5 percent; you\u2019re talking 250 million people,\" he says. If those people pay just a small portion of their monthly income, say $5 a piece, \"you\u2019re going to be in a billion dollars a month in revenue, tens of billions a year in revenue. So it\u2019s good business, too.\"\n\nRight now, each of Google's balloons cost tens of thousands of dollars to fly, but as Google pushes its research forward, that price will likely go down. Google believes Project Loon could be an enormous business \u2014 even bigger than YouTube, which currently pulls in about $4 billion in revenue per year.\n\nCassidy also pointed out that developed regions could be interested in Project Loon's services, too: Google met with Japanese officials interested in the project's potential for providing Internet service if infrastructure was ever compromised due to another typhoon.\n\nRelated: Google partners with wireless carriers to push Wallet service\n\nAlthough many people consider Google X (the branch of Google sprouting projects like smart contacts, self-driving cars, and Project Loon) as just a research lab for moonshot ideas, Cassidy made sure to dismiss that idea.\n\n\"Very early on in the project analysis it has to have a viable business model,\" he told Popper, \"And they are tough on the business model.\"\n\nRead the whole Verge piece here.\n\nProject Loon stands to be an enormous business for Google.
