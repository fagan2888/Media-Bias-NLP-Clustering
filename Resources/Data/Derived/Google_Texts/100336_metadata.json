About two-thirds is from federal payments, taxes and user fees designated for specific purposes.\n\nSome of the biggest changes from the state\u2019s original plan for fiscal year 2016:\n\n* A $337 million increase over the original plan for highway construction, to $2.2 billion. This is up from $1.5 billion in fiscal year 2015. In addition, McAuliffe\u2019s caboose calls for (a) an additional $16 million over plan for highway maintenance, to $1.57 billion, a figure that\u2019s still below fiscal year 2015, (b) an additional $6.1 million, to $41.2 million for toll facilities and (c) another $30 million of assistance to localities for transit, bringing that total to $923.9 million.\n\n* Medicaid spending (split 50/50 between the state and federal governments) would rise $343 million from the original plan for fiscal year 2016 to $8.8 billion. This is $701 million more than fiscal 2015. The state\u2019s share of the increase from plan is $172 million. Medicaid officials have reported higher than expected enrollment, probably when people asking about Obamacare learn that their kids are eligible for Medicaid.\n\n*Another $141 million (to $1.76 billion) for public employee health benefits\n\n*A cut of $34 million in state payments to local school systems to fund the minimal Standards of Quality required by state law. (To $5.73 billion; this is still $243 million more than SOQ payments in fiscal year 2015.)\n\n* An increase of $27 million (to $131.6 million) for administrative and support at the Department of Social Services\n\n* Children\u2019s protective services get an $18 million boost from the original plan (and from fiscal year 2015 spending, to reach $288 million)\n\n* A $14.3 million increase, to $45.8 million for the rehabilitative industries section of the Department for the Blind and Vision Impaired.\n\n*An additional $11.2 million (to $61.4 million) to boost payments to local and regional jails. The caboose doesn\u2019t say anything about the per-inmate, per-day rate, so presumably this reflects more people staying longer behind bars\n\n* Another $8.6 million for child care subsidies (to $156 million)\n\n*A cut of $8.2 million (to $25.5 million) for regulation of assisted living facilities, adult day care and child welfare agencies.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "A look at today's caboose bill", "Description": "A $100 billion-plus budget can look like a locomotive barreling down the track, but what about the caboose?
