Lee Bentley III. Athletes paid $50 to enter each of the lotteries.\n\nLotteries, generally defined as \u201ca scheme\u201d that involves \u201cconsideration, chance and prize,\u201d are prohibited by Florida law, according to court documents. The U.S. government is authorized to gain the forfeiture of such \u201cspecified unlawful activities.\u201d\n\nWith the forfeiture, federal prosecutors agreed not to press charges against the Ironman company.\n\nWorld Triathlon said it would change how it operates the lottery programs.\n\n\u201cWhile we do not agree with U.S. Department of Justice\u2019s interpretation of the relevant statutes or that there has been anything untoward or inappropriate in our operation of the Ironman Kona Lottery, Ironman chose to settle so that we can focus on our priorities \u2013 our athletes and our events,\u201d the company said in a statement.\n\nWorld Triathlon said winners of the 2015 lottery were unaffected by the forfeiture agreement and their slots in the Hawaii event would be honored.\n\nThe original Ironman race started in Waikiki, Hawaii in 1977. Its expansion blossomed after Tarpon Springs ophthalmologist James P. Gills launched World Triathlon Corp. in 1989. He sold the race series and company to a private equity firm in 2008.", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "The Tampa company that runs the Ironman World Championship triathlon has agreed to forfeit to federal authorities more than $2.7 million obtained in", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://health.wusf.usf.edu/post/tampa-ironman-corp-paying-feds-27m", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/healthnewsfl/files/styles/medium/public/201505/more_than_2_400_marines_and_civilians_biked_56-miles_through_base_during_the_ironman_70.3_triathlon_at_oceanside__calif.__march_30__2013_130330-m-ld192-533.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The Tampa company that runs the Ironman World Championship triathlon has agreed to forfeit to federal authorities more than $2.7 million obtained in", "title": "Tampa Ironman Corp.
