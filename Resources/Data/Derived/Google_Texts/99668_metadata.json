The company will also partner with many others, Musk said.\n\nTesla has several hundred batteries installed with SolarCity systems in California already. The growth of those projects has been helped by a subsidy from California's public utility regulator.\n\nUtilities have also been seeking out energy storage to help manage increasing amounts of renewable energy on the grid. To address that market, Musk unveiled what he called the \"power pack,\" a 100 kWh battery block that is meant to help smooth out power from intermittent solar and wind energy production or add energy to the grid quickly when demand levels are high.\n\nTesla already has several utility-scale batteries deployed on the grid in California, which requires its biggest utilities to source large amounts of energy storage.\n\nMusk told reporters Tesla expected to have a low but growing gross margin in battery products in the fourth quarter of this year and added that battery products would be \"materially profitable\" some time next year.\n\n\"A cost effective home energy storage system it could prove far more valuable, and profitable, than anything the company is doing with automobiles,\" Karl Brauer, a senior analyst with auto industry research firm Kelley Blue Book, said.\n\nTesla will initially manufacture the batteries at its automobile factory in California but will move production to its planned \"gigafactory\" in Nevada next year.\n\nDeutsche Bank estimated sales of stationary battery storage systems for homes and commercial uses could yield as much as $4.5 billion in revenue for Tesla. Analysts expect Tesla will build stationary storage systems around the same basic batteries it will produce for its vehicles at the large factory the company is building in Nevada.\n\nThough valued at just $200 million in 2012, the energy storage industry is expected to grow to $19 billion by 2017, according to research firm IHS CERA.\n\nTesla is not the only player in energy storage. Coda Energy, which rose from the ashes of a failed EV maker and is now owned by Fortress Investment and startups backed by the likes of Total , GE and Siemens are among the many companies going after shares of the stationary storage market.
