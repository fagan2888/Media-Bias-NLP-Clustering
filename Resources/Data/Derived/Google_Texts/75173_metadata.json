Next year and in succeeding years, the penalty will apply to employers with at least 50 employees, who \u2014 to avoid the penalty \u2014 will have to extend coverage to at least 95% of employees.\n\nUnder the individual mandate, employees not enrolled in a health care plan are liable in 2015 for a penalty of $325 or 2% of income, whichever is greater.\n\nIn addition, under the ACA excise tax provision that the measure would repeal, a 40% tax will be imposed, starting in 2018, on the portion of group health care plan premiums that exceed $10,200 for single coverage and $27,500 for family coverage.\n\nOther reform law provisions that the measure would repeal is one that imposes a 2.3% excise tax on manufacturers of medical devices and another that will require \u2014 once regulations are finalized \u2014 employers with at least 200 employees to automatically enroll employees who do not select a health plan offered by their employers.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Business Insurance", "description": "President Barack Obama would veto legislation that would repeal key parts of the health care reform law, including the employer and individual mandates, if it is approved by Congress, the White House said Wednesday.The health care reform repeal provisions, which also include repeal of the Patient...", "title": "Obama threatens to veto bill to repeal key health reform provisions - Business Insurance", "url": "http://www.businessinsurance.com/article/20151022/NEWS03/151029920", "image": "http://www.businessinsurance.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CB/20151022/NEWS03/151029920/AR/0/obama-health-care-reform-law.jpg", "type": "article"}, "image_src": "http://www.businessinsurance.com/assets/rwd/bi-logo-footer.png", "description": "President Barack Obama would veto legislation that would repeal key parts of the health care reform law, including the employer and individual mandates, if it is approved by Congress, the White House said Wednesday.The health care reform repeal provisions, which also include repeal of the Patient...", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimal-ui", "title": "Obama threatens to veto bill to repeal key health reform provisions - Business Insurance"}, "article_summary": "The health care reform repeal provisions, which also include repeal of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act's excise tax on costly health care plans and a tax on manufacturers of medical devices, are part of a broader budget reconciliation bill, H.R.\nPresident Barack Obama would veto legislation that would repeal key parts of the health care reform law, including the employer and individual mandates, if it is approved by Congress, the White House said Wednesday.\nThis legislation would roll back coverage gains and would cost millions of hard-working middle-class families the security of affordable health coverage they deserve.\u201dRepublican lawmakers, though, have a different view of the budget legislation.\n\u201cAn estimated 17.6 million Americans gained coverage as several of the Affordable Care Act's coverage provisions have taken effect \u2014 15.3 million since the beginning of the first open enrollment in October 2013.\n\u201cRepealing key elements of the Affordable Care Act would result in millions of individuals remaining uninsured or losing the insurance they have today,\u201d the White House said in a statement."}
