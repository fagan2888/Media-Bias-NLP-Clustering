But she has the ability to clear this up.\"\n\nMcCarthy's comments come three days after Rep. Trey Gowdy, chairman of the Republican-controlled House Select Committee on Benghazi, officially asked Clinton to turn over the server to a neutral party. House Speaker John A. Boehner also said last week the investigations into Benghazi could not be complete without access to all of the related Clinton emails.\n\nBenghazi is suddenly back in the spotlight after revelations that Clinton used a personal email account during her tenure at the State Department and that she had deleted thousands of what she called personal emails.\n\nGowdy, R-S.C., has given Clinton until March 27 to answer a subpoena issued for the documents.\n\nThe ranking Democrat on the panel, Maryland's Elijah E. Cummings, has argued the investigation is more interested in derailing a potential Clinton presidential run than with addressing any security problems exposed by the 2012 attack.\n\nRelated: Gowdy: Benghazi Panel Will Ask Clinton to Appear \u2014 Twice The 114th: CQ Roll Call's Guide to the New Congress Get breaking news alerts and more from Roll Call in your inbox or on your iPhone.", "article_metadata": {"description": "House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., added his voice Sunday to a growing number of Republicans calling for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to turn over her personal email server to an independent third-party arbiter.", "og": {"site_name": "Roll Call", "description": "House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., added his voice Sunday to a growing number of Republicans calling for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to turn over her personal email server to an independent third-party arbiter.", "title": "McCarthy: Clinton Should Turn Over the Email Server", "url": "http://www.rollcall.com/news/home/mccarthy-clinton-should-turn-over-the-email-server", "image": {"identifier": "http://cdn.images.rollcall.com/image/1ed71e81ff466910ac598f06d393a96c/blogs/sites/2/2015/02/mccarthy_092_030612-445x327.jpg", "type": "image/png"}, "updated_time": "2015-03-23T15:04:31Z", "type": "website"}, "abstract": "House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., added his voice Sunday to a growing number of Republicans calling for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to turn over her personal email server to an independent third-party arbiter.", "fb": {"app_id": 1383531991672364}, "keywords": "Blog ID,Author,category,category,author,category,category,category,benghazi,breaking-news,kevin-mccarthy,republicans-2,uncategorized", "article": {"section": "home", "published_time": "2015-03-23T15:04:31Z", "modified_time": "2015-03-23T15:04:31Z"}, "twitter": {"description": "House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., added his voice Sunday to a growing number of Republicans calling for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to turn over her personal email server", "title": "McCarthy: Clinton Should Turn Over the Email Server", "url": "http://www.rollcall.com/news/home/mccarthy-clinton-should-turn-over-the-email-server", "image": {"src": "http://cdn.images.rollcall.com/image/1ed71e81ff466910ac598f06d393a96c/blogs/sites/2/2015/02/mccarthy_092_030612-445x327.jpg"}, "site": "@rollcall", "card": "summary |player (See: https://dev.twitter.com/cards/types/player We will have to submit a test and get approval before using this type)"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., added his voice Sunday to a growing number of Republicans calling for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to turn over her personal email server to an independent third-party arbiter.\nMcCarthy's comments come three days after Rep.
