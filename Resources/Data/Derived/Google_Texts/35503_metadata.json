All children ages 0-18 entering foster care will be screened. Expansion of the pilot to half the state\u2019s counties is scheduled to begin by the summer of 2016. By 2018, all children in all 120 Kentucky counties will be screened within 30 days of entering out-of-home care.\n\nDCBS Commissioner Teresa James said children in foster care are more likely to have significant behavioral health concerns that affect their development.\n\n\u201cThrough this project, we can give lifelong, improved well-being to the children in out-of-home care who will transition back home and those placed for adoption,\u201d James said. \u201cAll of this will lead to better outcomes for the children and an easier path to permanency.\u201d\n\nProject SafeSpace is collaboration between DCBS, the CHFS Department for Behavioral Health, Developmental and Intellectual Disabilities, the University of Louisville, the Eastern Kentucky University Training Resource Center and the Kentucky Partnership for Families and Children.\n\nJames said that with the expansion of Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act increasing access to behavioral health assessment and treatment, the behavioral health of children and adults is getting a lot more attention. \u201cWe are so proud of Project SafeSpace and its mission to include children coming into out-of-home care under this umbrella of assistance,\u201d she said.\n\nProject SafeSpace Manager Nicole George said that Kentucky applied for the grant because in recent years, there has been an under-identification of children with behavioral health needs when they come into state care. Also, 19 percent of children placed in private child caring agencies, which are like residential homes, have one behavioral health diagnosis within six months of entry, and 27 percent have two or more.\n\n\u201cA lot of the children coming into care need special treatment or special medication for behavioral health issues,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want to identify these complex issues early and be responsive to kids\u2019 needs to give them the best possible care in their time of trauma.\u201d\n\nGeorge said that redesigning this service delivery system should reduce some symptoms that require treatment and decrease the recurrence of maltreatment. It should also decrease placement disruption.\n\n\u201cWe will know early on what treatments a child entering care will need and what foster families might be best trained and equipped to provide it,\u201d she said. \u201cStability is very important to these children\u2019s well-being.\u201d\n\nKPFC Executive Director Carol Cecil said that her group will bring a parent focus to the project\u2019s leadership team.\n\n\u201cWe will educate parents on what to expect with the screening and assessment so that both birth and foster parents can be an integral part of the treatment team for a child,\u201d she said.\n\nCecil said that she is also an adoptive parent and has seen a great need for a uniform screening.\n\n\u201cMy hope is that by providing the appropriate mental health care, Kentucky will improve children\u2019s behavioral health, which in turn will reduce a child\u2019s need to be moved,\u201d she said. \u201cAn increase in stability will help a child feel safe, loved and important.\u201d\n\nFayette County Family Court Judge Lucinda Masterton\u2019s district is one of Project SafeSpace\u2019s first pilot regions, and she has been involved in the pilot\u2019s planning process for the past two years.\n\nMasterton said the project should reduce the number of placements for children.\n\n\u201cFor kids coming into care \u2013 especially kids with behavioral needs \u2013 they go through a bunch of placements at the start, because we don\u2019t know what their needs are,\u201d she said. \u201cBy having a good screening process right at the beginning for these children, we have a better shot at giving appropriate placement for them and getting them appropriate therapy really quickly.\u201d\n\nMasterton said that information about the children resulting from the screenings will better prepare foster families.\n\n\u201cWe can place a child with a family who is trained and capable of dealing with the issues that the child presents, so that the family does not \u2013 at some point down the road \u2013 become surprised when a child acts out. We can tell them, \u2018this is what you can expect to see, what fears and behaviors they might show,\u2019 and they won\u2019t sign up if they are not prepared.\u201d\n\nThe pilot project is so well-planned, Masterton said, that its eventual evaluation will provide helpful analytical information.\n\n\u201cWe will get some great numbers,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can look at court-performance measures like number of placements in the first six months and number of months in care.\u201d\n\nGeorge said that the children\u2019s DCBS caseworkers will provide the initial behavioral health screening through a standard, web-based application. Many other states are already using a similar screening process to measure foster children\u2019s strengths and needs.\n\nTo learn more about becoming a foster parent, log on to http://chfs.ky.gov/dcbs/dpp/faqfostercare.htm or call 1-800-232-KIDS (1-800- 232-5437).\n\nFrom Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "DCBS Commissioner Teresa James said children in foster care are more likely to have significant behavioral health concerns that affect their development.\n\u201cMy hope is that by providing the appropriate mental health care, Kentucky will improve children\u2019s behavioral health, which in turn will reduce a child\u2019s need to be moved,\u201d she said.\nJames said that with the expansion of Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act increasing access to behavioral health assessment and treatment, the behavioral health of children and adults is getting a lot more attention.\n\u201cA lot of the children coming into care need special treatment or special medication for behavioral health issues,\u201d she said.\nAll children ages 0-18 entering foster care will be screened."}
