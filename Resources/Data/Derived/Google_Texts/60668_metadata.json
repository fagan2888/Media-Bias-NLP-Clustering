Given their anxiety, anxious people often attribute their inability to concentrate or be productive to an inherent flaw. In reality, it\u2019s the anxiety itself that\u2019s putting their brains in overdrive, forcing them to focus on any little fray or distraction that comes their way.\n\nA new study aims to help anxiety sufferers learn to focus better and reduce their racing, panicked thoughts. Researchers from Michigan State University created a \u201cbrain game\u201d that uses shapes to help people avoid distractions.\n\nThe researchers examined participants who had both low and high anxiety in the study. They gave them a focus task that involved choosing a specific shape out of a series of shapes, afterward threw in a distraction by mixing in different colored shapes, and found that even the anxious people didn\u2019t get distracted thanks to the previous focus exercise, which had improved their ability to concentrate on specific things.\n\n\u201cDown the line we could roll out an online or mobile game based on this research that specifically targets distraction and helps people stay focused and feel less anxious,\u201d Jason Moser, an author of the study, said in the press release. \u201cThere have been other studies of video game-type interventions for anxiety, but none have used a specific and simple game that targets distraction.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Calm Clinic, when an anxious person feels scattered and distracted, it\u2019s not that they\u2019re not concentrating. Instead, the brain is working extra hard to concentrate \u2014 but it\u2019s frayed in too many different directions. \u201cWhat\u2019s interesting is that calling them concentration problems may be misleading,\u201d the website states. \u201cOften you ARE concentrating \u2014 you\u2019re simply concentrating on the wrong things, like your anxiety and the way it makes you feel.\u201d\n\nPrevious studies have shown that anxiety often causes people\u2019s brains to go into overdrive \u2014 ultimately resulting in mental burnout and exhaustion. A 2012 study also out of Michigan State University found that anxiety, specifically among girls, made their brains burn out faster when learning new things.\n\n\u201cAnxious girls\u2019 brains have to work harder to perform tasks because they have distracting thoughts and worries,\u201d Moser, who was an author of this study as well, said in the press release. \u201cAs a result their brains are being kind of burned out by thinking so much, which might set them up for difficulties in school.\u201d\n\nUntil a mobile game appears, there are several ways to battle anxiety and distracting thoughts in order to improve your focus. You can try to drown out your worrisome thoughts by adding in a \u201csensory stimulation,\u201d like music or TV in the background. You can also journal, and get your thoughts out on paper, so they\u2019re less invasive in your mind. Finding a quiet place in which distractions \u2014 like noise, the Internet, or co-workers \u2014 are limited can make it easier for your brain to focus on one thing at a time.\n\nSource: Moser J, Moran T, Leber A.
