SEN. TED CRUZ: "It has been several days since I have been to the floor of the Senate and yet I feel I have been here in absentia because so many Democrats have invoked my name as the root of all evil in the world. And, indeed, the same Majority Leader that gave an ode to civility just a few days ago was describing me and anyone who might agree that we should stop the harms of Obamacare, describing us as "anarchists." So, I think the encouragement towards civility is an encouragement that should be heard across the board."
