Some employers worry a mandated higher wage would harm their businesses, but employees say they can\u2019t live on current minimums.\n\nCori Shetter is a college graduate and aspiring actress who\u2019s worked minimum-wage jobs for 15 years.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like swinging from Tarzan vine to Tarzan vine. One vine\u2019s about to end and break, so you just grab the next one, but you\u2019re never really putting your feet on solid ground,\u201d said the 31-year-old Pittsburgh resident.\n\nLiving in her Lawrenceville home is only possible because her parents own it, and Shetter pays them as much of the mortgage and other expenses as she can.\n\nThe one major thing she could do to further her career goals \u2014 auditioning \u2014 has fallen by the wayside as she invests most of her time in serving jobs for small, but reliable, paychecks. She supplements that by cutting hair for up to 10 clients a month at home.\n\nMany servers, like Shetter, earn Pennsylvania\u2019s tipped minimum wage of $2.83 per hour. The standard minimum wage, both state and federal, is $7.25.\n\nMany believe the minimum wage hasn\u2019t kept up with the times, and movements to raise it are being led by grassroots groups and governments in communities across the nation. In June, Los Angeles became the biggest city in the country to raise its minimum wage to $15 by 2020.\n\nNineteen U.S. cities and counties experienced mandated wage increases this year; 29 states and Washington, D.C., already require employers to pay workers more than $7.25.\n\nPennsylvania isn\u2019t part of this group \u2014 yet.\n\nThere are five bills pending in the state Legislature proposing to raise the minimum wage, with different methods and standards ranging from $8.75 to $15. Some politicians and business owners said they worry that putting this mandate on employers could mean fewer job openings and other cutbacks in the business community.\n\n\u201cIf minimum wage is hiked, many of these jobs will vanish, or work hours will be drastically cut,\u201d state Rep. Stephen Bloom, R-Cumberland, wrote in an email. \u201cEmployers simply find less costly alternatives, either through automation, technology or other means.\u201d\n\nEven economists, who also have opinions, disagree about the impact. Although some studies indicate a minimum-wage increase would cause job losses, other studies show just the opposite, said Sean Flaherty, the economics chair at Franklin & Marshall College in Lancaster.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s just no strong consensus evidence that this is a significant problem when you have a modest increase in the minimum wage, done in stepwise fashion,\u201d Flaherty said.\n\nThe proposals\n\nThe federal wage hasn\u2019t increased since 2009, when it rose from $6.55 to $7.25. In 2008, it rose from $5.85.\n\nSeveral states, counties and cities are taking the matter into their own hands.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, the most ambitious proposed bill is from Sen. Daylin Leach, D-Delaware, Montgomery. His \u201cOne Fair Wage\u201d bill would raise the wage to $15 an hour and tie it to inflation across the board, for regular and tipped employees.\n\n\u201cThere shouldn\u2019t be a subminimum wage,\u201d Leach said. \u201cYou cannot outsource paying your workers.\u201d\n\nThe tipped minimum wage can apply to any employee \u2014 delivery driver, hair stylist, nail technician, busboy or bartender \u2014 who earns more than $30 or more in tips each month. If the tips don\u2019t bring a worker\u2019s wages up to $7.25, the employer is legally supposed to make up the difference, but some servers interviewed say that rarely happens.\n\nState Rep. Patty Kim, D-Dauphin, also wants to raise the wage, but her bill calls for a more gradual increase. If passed, her bill would raise Pennsylvania\u2019s wage to $9 and then to $10.10 a year later.\n\nAnother proposal backed by state Sen. Scott Wagner, R-York, would gradually increase the wage to $8.75 over the next three years.\n\nAnd a bill sponsored by state Sen. Christine Tartaglione, D-Philadelphia, would bring the state\u2019s tipped minimum wage to 70 percent of the regular minimum wage by 2016.\n\nA fifth proposal specifically targets the wages of employees of long-term care facilities.\n\nIn a recent study conducted by the left-leaning Harrisburg think tank Keystone Research Center, 52 percent of nursing-home employees in Pennsylvania said they can\u2019t support their families on the wages they earn.\n\nState Rep. Ed Gainey, D-Allegheny, introduced the Nursing Facility Accountability Act in late June. The bill would incentivize nursing facilities to pay workers at least $15 an hour by publicizing wages and denoting nursing facilities that pay a \u201cliving wage.\u201d\n\nSingle mom Ashley Palmer, 29, earns $12.50 as a personal-care aide at Amber Woods at HarmarVillage Care Center, an assisted living facility in Cheswick, Pa. Her duties range from stocking linen carts to administering medications and helping residents use the bathroom.\n\n\u201cI have been doing doubles upon doubles because I\u2019m just trying to make ends meet for my family,\u201d said Palmer, who has three children. \u201cWith taxes and everything, my paycheck doesn\u2019t even pay my rent and car payments together.\u201d\n\nAlthough Palmer said she would love $15 an hour, she worries the cost of living would just go up with it if all workers got the pay bump.\n\nLeach thinks lifting everyone to $15 will at least provide for the basic needs in life.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve spoken with a dozen people who have two and a half jobs just to try and make enough to put a roof over their kids\u2019 heads,\u201d Leach said.\n\nWhen businesses decide\n\nMany believe individual business owners should decide whether to pay workers more.\n\nChristian Smith, co-owner of Bright Ideas Childcare and Preschool in Altoona, said a mandated $15 wage would force him to close his business. Currently, about five of his 19 employees earn $7.25, and the others earn more.\n\n\u201cOver time, and if they earn credentials, employees will receive higher wages,\u201d Smith said.\n\nBright Ideas also helps cover training and education costs for employees who want to earn more credentials, Smith said. If the minimum wage rises, he said the business would have to cut back on that support.\n\nAlex Halper, director of government affairs for the Pennsylvania Chamber of Business and Industry, said small business owners are worried that mandated increases would mean losing the profit they\u2019ve been able to hold onto in a difficult economy.\n\n\u201cAdvocates [of raising the minimum wage] sort of present this false choice,\u201d Halper said. \u201cEither you support these significant increases to entry-level wages, or you don\u2019t care about people in poverty.\u201d\n\nAt Wigle Whiskey, a family-owned business in Pittsburgh that opened in 2012, tipped workers are paid more than twice the tipped minimum wage, said co-owner Meredith Grelli.\n\nMeagan Gemperlein, 25, a part-time tipped employee at Wigle, said she thinks a higher wage makes workers want to be more proactive.\n\n\u201cIt makes it worth it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt makes however long I can be here, for whatever time, worth it.\u201d\n\nIncentive\n\nWigle Whiskey is also planning to participate in a government-backed incentive program to increase wages.\n\nIn March, the Pittsburgh City Council approved the Market Based Revenue Opportunity Program, which is designed to encourage local businesses to pay above minimum wage in exchange for free promotion for their business.\n\nEmployers who prove they pay at least $10.10 per hour \u2014 or at least $3.93, for tipped employees \u2014 will get promotions on city-owned space, such as bus shelters and building walls.\n\nCouncilman Corey O\u2019Connor, who introduced the program, said promotions could appear on more than 600 public spaces throughout Pittsburgh. He said the goal of the program is to increase wealth across the city.\n\n\u201cWe actually have it on a sliding scale, so if the state were to raise our minimum wage, we\u2019d raise our requirements as well,\u201d O\u2019Connor said.\n\nAs of publication, the city Department of Finance hadn\u2019t received any applications for the program, which launched May 26. Grelli at Wigle Whiskey said she filed paperwork in mid-August.\n\nSome low-wage employees remain skeptical.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think $3.93 would make that big of a difference, to be honest,\u201d said Kim Carroll, 40, a waitress at the Rum Runners Saloon in the North Hills of Pittsburgh.\n\nCarroll, who\u2019s worked in restaurants on and off since she was 18, said there\u2019s no way she and her three children could survive on minimum wage without financial support from her family.\n\nBecause she typically works day shifts, she\u2019ll often walk out with $20 in tips after a five-hour shift. That\u2019s what she\u2019ll earn in one hour at her other part-time job as a dance instructor.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s awful. You can\u2019t even buy a tank of gas for $20, let alone pay all your bills and take care of three kids,\u201d she said.\n\n\u2018Like quicksand\u2019\n\nMinimum-wage workers in 1968 were better off than the employees of today. The 1968 minimum wage of $1.60 actually translates to $8.54 after adjusting for inflation.\n\nMark Price, a labor economist at the Keystone Research Center, said raising the floor would impact more than just those people currently earning minimum wage.\n\n\u201cThe minimum wage is sort of like quicksand,\u201d he said. \u201cAs it has lost its purchasing power, it\u2019s pulled down not only wages for people who earn the minimum, but also wages for people who earn within shouting distance of the minimum. It\u2019s that bottom 20 percent of workers who are affected.\u201d\n\nThe National Low Income Housing Coalition estimates that in Pennsylvania, a worker needs to earn $17.57 per hour to afford to rent a two-bedroom apartment. A minimum-wage employee in the state would need to work about 78 hours per week to rent a one-bedroom place.\n\nDerek Gower, 25, lives with his parents even though he earns a slightly higher wage of $12 an hour.\n\nAfter Gower returned from a three-year stint teaching English to kindergarteners in South Korea and Vietnam, he got a part-time job at a grocery store in Berwick, a borough in Columbia County. He wanted to save money and start paying off his $15,000 in student loans.\n\n\u201cWhen I got my first paycheck, I just sort of had to laugh at what I was getting paid,\u201d Gower said. It was about $160 for a week\u2019s work.\n\nThe store wasn\u2019t able to offer Gower full-time hours. He went looking for another part-time gig, which he found at a chip factory. But the grocery store wouldn\u2019t work with his new schedule, so he left. Gower still works at the factory, clocking most of his hours on the weekend cleaning crew.\n\nGower plans to attend graduate school to study public policy at the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Va., later this month.\n\n\u201cStudent loans are my biggest concern, but it\u2019s OK because everybody has them,\u201d Gower said. \u201cPart of the reason I\u2019m going back to graduate school is because I want to do something more fulfilling.\u201d\n\nReach freelancer Molly Duerig at mollyduerig@gmail.com.
