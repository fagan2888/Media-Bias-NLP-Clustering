Many of the new positions are arising in response to new regulatory incentives and mandates from the Affordable Care Act, particularly for transitioning from volume- to value-based care.\n\nOther factors such as controlling costs and providing care for an aging population also were cited in the survey.\n\nAmong survey respondents, 86 percent said they recognized the growing need for new types of health care positions, but relatively low percentages, in many cases, said they are actively preparing for this need.\n\n\u201cBoth the data and the comments gathered by the survey show that health care leaders understand the importance of these emerging roles in the new health care environment,\u201d said Marcia Faller, RN, chief clinical officer at AMN Healthcare. \u201cBut not that many health care enterprises are actively recruiting or training for these jobs, especially when it comes to new strategic leadership roles.\u201d\n\nAmong the new jobs in health care are clinical roles of care coordinator, navigator, health coach, medical scribe and telehealth-trained practitioner; leadership roles of chief population health officer, chief experience officer, chief clinical transformation officer and chief strategy officer; and technical roles of clinical documentation specialist and ICD-10 Coder.\n\nSusan Salka, president, CEO and director of AMN Healthcare, said the emergence of new health care positions is part of the industry\u2019s ongoing transformation to new care models and redefined reimbursement formulas that emphasize quality-of-care indicators.\n\n\u201cFor example, the increase in chronic conditions among older people and the push to reduce readmissions and improve pa\u00adtient satisfaction require greater care coordination between patient, provider and payer,\u201d Salka said. \u201cSo it\u2019s not surprising that the clinical position of care coordinator, which was relatively unknown a few years ago, is today in great demand.\u201d\n\n\u201cHealth care is the most dynamic employment sector in the country, not only in job growth but now also in the emergence of new types of jobs,\u201d Salka said. \u201cHigh demand for health care professionals will continue for the foreseeable future. This survey suggests that health care providers will need help in preparing for it.\u201d\n\nJewish Community Foundation\n\nTops $1 Billion in Charitable Grants\n\nThe Jewish Community Foundation of San Diego has surpassed the $1 billion milestone in charitable grants since its inception in 1967. The foundation is the largest grantmaker in the San Diego region, exceeding $100 million in grants annually to strengthen nonprofits.\n\nThe $1 billion milestone was reached this fall. The foundation manages more than 700 endowment and donor advised funds with over $300 million in assets. In its 47-year history, more than 60,000 grants have been made to 5,000 community and charitable organizations. About 75 percent of these grants supported programs in the San Diego region.\n\n\u201cWe are extremely proud to surpass the $1 billion grantmaking milestone,\u201d said Jane Scher, foundation board chair. \u201cReaching this point is a result of inspired philanthropists who follow their passions and deeply impact lives for the better with every grant.\u201d\n\nSDSU Starts Work on $143 Million\n\nStudent Housing and Retail Project\n\nSan Diego State University will break ground today on its $143 million South Campus Plaza, a mixed-use student housing and retail project set to open next fall.\n\nThe finished project on the former Plaza Linda Verde site at the intersection of Campanile Drive and Hardy Avenue, just south of the SDSU Transit Center, will house more than 600 students and retail outlets that will serve students and campus-adjacent residents, according to SDSU.\n\nThe South Campus Plaza\u2019s residence halls will feature double-occupancy student rooms, along with apartments for residential education staff and visitors, according to the university. The building will also include study areas, lounges, a community kitchen, a mail room, bicycle storage and a laundry room.\n\nPlans for the retail component include a community market, restaurants and other shops. Negotiations with future tenants are underway, according to the university.\n\nThe project will be constructed in two phases, beginning with two residential buildings, above ground-floor retail and an adjacent parking structure.\n\nNo proposed date was provided for the start of phase two, which will be located on the east side of College Avenue.\n\n\u2013 City News Service\n\nCity Council Unanimously OKs\n\nAmbitious Water Recycling Plan\n\nThe City Council on Tuesday unanimously approved a major step toward recycling San Diego\u2019s waste water into drinking water.\n\n\u201cThe innovative Pure Water project is an investment in our future that will provide San Diego the reliable water supply we need for our economy to grow and our city to thrive,\u201d said Mayor Kevin Faulconer in a statement after the vote. \u201cI thank the City Council for its support.\u201d\n\nThe vote officially sought renewal of a federal permit needed to continue operations of the Point Loma Wastewater Treatment Plant. Within the plan, however, is a commitment by the city to begin a $3.5 billion project to recycle water for potable use.\n\nSupporters hope the pledge will allow the city to avoid spending $2 billion to upgrade the aging treatment plant. While the outlay is higher, the payoff would be a new, stable source of water for the drought-prone city.\n\nThe project is touted as being able to recycle enough purified water to make up a third of San Diego\u2019s drinking water in 2035. A demonstration plant in Miramar is already producing a million gallons a day of recycled water that is cleaner than what comes from the Colorado River.\n\n\u201cThis is one of the city\u2019s most critical projects that will help our region grow and thrive, and establish San Diego as a national environmental leader,\u201d Faulconer said at an event last week.\n\nEnvironmental groups like San Diego Coastkeeper, Surfrider Foundation San Diego Chapter, Coastal Environmental Rights Foundation and the San Diego Audubon Society all back the city\u2019s approach.\n\n\u201cSan Diego is at the end of the pipe, and we need solutions now,\u201d said Coastal Environmental Rights Foundation Executive Director Marco Gonzalez. \u201cThis is going to give us a new, drought-proof water source that we desperately need to succeed as a region.\u201d\n\nOften derided with names like \u201ctoilet-to-tap,\u201d a multi-step cleansing process being tested by the city 1 million gallons daily produces water cleaner than what residents drink now and meets or exceeds quality standards, according to backers of the plan.\n\nThe project would be paid for by a mix of state and federal grants, and rate increases on consumers.\n\n\u2013 Times of San Diego with City News Service\n\nAttorney Richard Huver to Head\n\nSan Diego County Bar Association\n\nAttorney Richard Huver, a solo practitioner at Huver Law Firm, will be sworn in as the president of the San Diego County Bar Association on Dec. 5.

At UC San Diego, students staged a sit-in in front of Geisel Library as part of the \u201cDay of Action Against the UC Tuition Plan.\u201d\n\nUCSD student Anali Valdez said that if the increase is approved, it would mean a 287 percent tuition increase between 2002 and 2020. \u201cThat\u2019s insane,\u201d she told Fox 5.\n\nUnder the proposal, in-state students would pay $612 more for the 2015-16 school year, or $12,804. Out-of-state students would pay the same increased rate, plus a nonresident fee of $22,878, which would also increase by the same percentage, according to the university system.\n\nAssembly Speaker Toni Atkins, D-San Diego, who is a member of the Board of Regents, is among those sympathizing with the students. In a statement, Atkins said she would reject the proposal and instead suggest that the university system receive an additional $50 million from the state\u2019s general fund.\n\nGov. Jerry Brown also opposes the proposed hike, as does Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, an ex-officio regent, and Rep. John Garamendi, D-Fairfield, a former member of the UC Board of Regents and California State University trustee.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "San Diego Metro Magazine", "title": "Daily Business Report-Nov. 19, 2014 - San Diego Metro Magazine", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.sandiegometro.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Don-Coryell.jpg", "url": "http://www.sandiegometro.com/2014/11/daily-business-report-nov-19-2014/", "type": "article"}, "keywords": "San Diego Metro Magazine", "twitter": {"image": "http://www.sandiegometro.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/EMR-Medical-Scribe-2-300x290.jpg", "site": "@sandiegometro", "card": "summary", "description": "Medical scribe is one of the new jobs emerging from the health care industry, according to a report by the..."}, "description": "Medical scribe is one of the new jobs emerging from the health care industry, according to a report by the Center for Professional Advancement at San Diego", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdae72\"", "article_summary": "Environmental groups like San Diego Coastkeeper, Surfrider Foundation San Diego Chapter, Coastal Environmental Rights Foundation and the San Diego Audubon Society all back the city\u2019s approach.\nThe foundation is the largest grantmaker in the San Diego region, exceeding $100 million in grants annually to strengthen nonprofits.\n\u201cSan Diego is at the end of the pipe, and we need solutions now,\u201d said Coastal Environmental Rights Foundation Executive Director Marco Gonzalez.\n\u2013 Times of San Diego with City News ServiceAttorney Richard Huver to HeadSan Diego County Bar AssociationAttorney Richard Huver, a solo practitioner at Huver Law Firm, will be sworn in as the president of the San Diego County Bar Association on Dec. 5.\nAbout 75 percent of these grants supported programs in the San Diego region."}
