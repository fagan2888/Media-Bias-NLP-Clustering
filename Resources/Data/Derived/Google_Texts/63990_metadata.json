A government report says the government web portal logged 316 security incidents during a period of about 18 months.\n\nThe nonpartisan Government Accountability Office says none of the attempted cyberattacks appeared to have succeeded in compromising sensitive data, including the personal information of millions of consumers shopping for subsidized health insurance.\n\nHowever, GAO said it identified weaknesses protecting sensitive information that flows through a key part of the system that\u2019s called the data services hub. The hub pings federal agencies such as Social Security, IRS, and Homeland Security to verify personal information.\n\nThe security incidents took place between October 2013 and March 2015.\n\nFederal government computer systems \u2014 from the Defense Department to the White House \u2014 are ongoing targets for hackers.\n\nTM and \u00a9 Copyright 2016 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.
