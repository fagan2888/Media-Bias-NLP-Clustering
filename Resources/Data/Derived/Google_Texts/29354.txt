The Waldo Canyon trail is going wild.

It has been nearly three years since the popular, scenic hike was barred to the public after the 2012 Waldo Canyon fire, which ignited just west of the trail in the Pike National Forest. Since the fire, Mother Nature has been having her way with the once-beloved hiking area that climbs above westbound U.S. 24.

Grass covers the trail's first steps leading out of the parking lot. Noxious weeds blur the lines between trail and wilderness. Sometimes, dust in the air smells like soot.

While the trail's first few turns would be familiar, if overgrown, to its fans, floodwaters have all but obliterated its upper loop. Where the trail used to fork, it's unrecognizable.

A few familiar things remain - such as a log bench and a battered sign pointing to "Waldo Canyon Trail, 31/2 mile loop." Copses of trees stand alive, almost miraculously, amid row after row of blackened and weathered sticks.

The trail transforms every year, as snowmelt and summer rains carve new paths down Waldo Canyon. Past the trail's fork, the streambed has washed away traces of the trail, burying it in feet of sediment, boulders and dead trees. Without droves of hikers, runners and mountain bikers hitting the trail every day, Waldo Canyon has become the kind of place where bears are surprised to see a human.
