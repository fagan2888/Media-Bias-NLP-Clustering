Some routes may be diverted due to down trees. Please be patient,\u201d Tweeted Oakville councillor Jeff Knoll.\u201d\n\nSaid Burlington City Manager Jeff Fielding, \u201cCity crews continue to sand and salt city roads, as well as clearing downed trees and branches from roadways. Roads are extremely hazardous and we suggest that residents stay off the roads.\u201d\n\nResidents using candles and generators during the power outage are asked to do so with extreme caution. Portable generators should only be used outdoors and be carefully located to ensure that exhaust fumes do not enter the home.\n\nA flood warning also continues to be in effect, and residents are advised to exercise extreme caution near any waterways. Homeowners are urged to check catch basins adjacent to their property to ensure they aren\u2019t blocked.\n\nWhile roads continue to be especially slick, Halton Police have not reported any influx of accidents due to the storm.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: Due to early holiday press deadlines all InsideHalton.com Boxing Day (Dec. 26) print editions \u2014 including the Burlington Post, Milton Canadian Champion and Oakville Beaver \u2014 do not include coverage of the ice storm.
