A new survey of likely voters in five states -- Florida, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Virginia -- shows solid majorities believe the Affordable Care Act is here to stay (64 percent) and that Congress should work to improve the law (71 percent), according to a news release from the Commonwealth Institute, which supports Medicaid expansion in Virginia.

The survey was conducted by PerryUndem Research/Communication between September 15-19, 2015 polling 1,005 adults who said they were likely to vote in the 2016 elections and have a history of voting in the 2012 or 2008 elections responded.

The margin of error is +/- 3.1 percentage points.

"Moreover, in all five states, a large majority of voters support closing the health care coverage gap, created when the Supreme Court made expanding Medicaid optional under the ACA.

In Virginia, nearly three-quarters of voters (74 percent) said Virginia should accept the federal funding set aside (for Medicaid expansion) to close the coverage gap, an action that would make health care coverage available for up to 400,000 uninsured Virginians.

"This latest survey confirms what we continue to hear over and over across Virginia," said Jill Hanken of the Virginia Poverty Law Center. "Voters understand that their fellow hardworking Virginians need the security of health coverage to get care when they need it, without facing huge medical bills or going into bankruptcy."

Thirty one states nationwide have adopted Medicaid expansion.
