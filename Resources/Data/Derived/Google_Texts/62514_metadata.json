Police say the 28-year-old Cleaves had unprotected sex with her seven times over a three-day period.\n\nThe woman told police she found medical tests in Cleaves' backpack saying he was HIV-positive, and that he later sent her text messages saying he wasn't a bad person but had made a mistake. He's facing seven counts in relation to that case.\n\nAnother woman has since come forward, and Cleaves is facing two additional counts.\n\nCleaves has been accused in several sexual assaults in the Richmond and Virginia Beach area, according to NBC12. Many of the victims said they blacked out or had medicated themselves before Cleaves allegedly assaulted them.\n\nNone of the victims indicated whether Cleaves had disclosed his HIV status, NBC12 reports.\n\nCleaves posted bond and is awaiting his next court date. No attorney is listed for him in court records.\n\nPolice are looking into whether Cleaves has had unprotected sex with other women.\n\nCopyright Associated Press / NBC4 Washington", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Virginia man has been arrested on charges of having unprotected sex with a Maryland woman without telling her he was HIV-positive.", "title": "PD: Va.
