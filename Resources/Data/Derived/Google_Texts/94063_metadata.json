Chandrasekhar, president of Nasscom. \"Immigration reform in general in the U.S. is something that has to happen sooner or later.\"\n\nBut as Indian IT firms sharpen focus on high-margin digital technology services instead of routine technology infrastructure maintenance and software application projects, they would need to send fewer staff to client locations overseas, analysts said.\n\n\"These companies know that with digital services you can cut down the number of people that need to work out of client locations and that visa costs do not pose a long-term threat,\" said Srivastava, whose funds own Infosys and TCS shares.\n\n\"With legacy business shrinking, the larger digital becomes, the more it can move the needle in terms of top line growth,\" said Moshe Katri, a New York-based sector analyst at CRT Stern Agee.\n\n(Editing by Sumeet Chatterjee and Adrian Croft)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "MUMBAI (Reuters) - India's export-driven IT outsourcing firms are likely to raise clie", "title": "India IT firms may raise fees to counter dearer U.S. visas", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/01/11/India-IT-firms-may-raise-fees-counter-dearer-US-visas", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/outsourcing-india_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/01/11/India-IT-firms-may-raise-fees-counter-dearer-US-visas", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/outsourcing-india_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "MUMBAI (Reuters) - India's export-driven IT outsourcing firms are likely to raise clie", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "MUMBAI (Reuters) - India's export-driven IT outsourcing firms are likely to raise client fees and process more work from their centers in India to cushion the impact of an increase in fees for work visas in the United States, their top market, investors said.\n\"The higher fee is unjustified because it is designed to hurt India firms disproportionately,\" said R.
