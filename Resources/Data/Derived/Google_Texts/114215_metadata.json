I talked to (wife) Ashley, my dad (Archie), (agent Tom) Condon.\u201d\n\nIt had gotten around that Gruden, a former NFL coach who just re-upped with ESPN as the color analyst for \u201cMonday Night Football,\u201d helped steer Manning to Denver because he believed the veteran quarterback would be a good match with a seasoned coach such as John Fox.\n\n\u201cHe and Fox are buddies, but \u2026\u201d Manning said. \u201cJon did like Denver. But he liked Seattle too. I wouldn\u2019t say he was the reason I came to Denver.\u201d\n\nWhile Manning appreciated the counsel he received during the process, he downplayed Gruden\u2019s impact, saying it wasn\u2019t any one thing but many reasons why he picked the Broncos.\n\nFox and front office boss John Elway were reasons. The talented young duo of wide receivers Demaryius Thomas and Eric Decker, plus Pro Bowl offensive tackle Ryan Clady, carried influence too.\n\nAs a quarterback known for his meticulous preparation, Manning\u2019s initial feel for offensive coordinator Mike McCoy and quarterbacks coach Adam Gase was a huge factor.\n\n\u201cI felt comfortable with them,\u201d Manning said. \u201cI had so much on my plate physically at the time and they were open to working around (his rehab schedule).\u201d\n\nDefensive coordinator Jack Del Rio, who as a former Jacksonville Jaguars coach had matched up twice a year against Manning\u2019s Colts, was a reason.\n\nManning\u2019s friendship with Todd Helton and Brandon Stokley didn\u2019t hurt. It was a factor that the Broncos played in Manning\u2019s preferred AFC. That preference, by the way, didn\u2019t have as much to do with his younger brother Eli playing for the NFC\u2019s New York Giants as people might think.\n\n\u201cI liked the AFC, not because I didn\u2019t like the NFC,\u201d Manning said. \u201cI just knew the AFC better, knew the teams more.\u201d\n\nDenver as a place for Manning and Ashley to raise their twin children was a big reason.\n\nEven if Gruden didn\u2019t steer Manning to Denver, he didn\u2019t advise him to go elsewhere either.\n\nLook at what happened to three other finalists in the Manning Derby. The Tennessee Titans, just two years after failing to court Manning, fired coach Mike Munchak and now have Ken Whisenhunt.\n\nWhisenhunt was available because he had been fired as coach of the Arizona Cardinals, who visited with Manning. The San Francisco 49ers are about to fire coach Jim Harbaugh, according to months of various reports.\n\nThe Houston Texans could have been a finalist, but they decided not to get involved in the Manning recruitment and last year coach Gary Kubiak was fired.\n\nMeanwhile, Manning, Fox and Gruden happily work on.\n\nMike Klis: mklis@denverpost.com or twitter.com/mikeklis", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Klis: Peyton Manning to meet up with former recruiting \u201cadvisor\u201d Jon Gruden", "title": "Klis: Peyton Manning to meet up with former recruiting \u201cadvisor\u201d Jon Gruden", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/12/20/klis-peyton-manning-to-meet-up-with-former-recruiting-advisor-jon-gruden/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141218_114044_peyton-manning-1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141218_114044_peyton-manning-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-20T19:42:16+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T08:42:53+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe193b\"", "article_summary": "Even if Gruden didn\u2019t steer Manning to Denver, he didn\u2019t advise him to go elsewhere either.\nWhen Manning was released by the Indianapolis Colts to free agency in March 2012, he confided in Gruden during the recruiting process.\nThe Tennessee Titans, just two years after failing to court Manning, fired coach Mike Munchak and now have Ken Whisenhunt.\n\u201cI did talk to Jon during the process,\u201d Manning said.\n\u201cJon did like Denver."}
