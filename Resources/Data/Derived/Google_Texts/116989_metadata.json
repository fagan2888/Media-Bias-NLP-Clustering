Chris Christie's (R) latest web ad released Thursday skewered former Sen. Rick Santorum's (R-PA) rambling and inarticulate endorsement of Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) for President.\n\nSantorum, who suspended his campaign on Wednesday, announced his endorsement of Rubio on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" the next day. But when pressed, repeatedly, for a specific reason why he picked Rubio, Santorum stumbled. Eventually he mentioned Rubio's role in an amendment related to fighting Obamacare.\n\nThe Christie campaign put carnival music behind a shortened version of Santorum's interview with MSNBC. The ad is titled \"It's A Simple Question.\"\n\nChristie campaign spokeswoman Samantha Smith told The Hill the ad \"highlights yet again Marco Rubio\u2019s total lack of experience.\" She would not disclose the size of the digital ad buy.\n\nThe digital ad wasn't the only time Christie's campaign commented on Santorum's endorsement.\n\nDuring a town hall in Henniker, New Hampshire, Christie joked that one accomplishment named by Santorum\u2014\"some amendment on Obamacare at one point\"\u2014earned Rubio a place on Mount Rushmore alongside George Washington.\n\n\"They gave Sen. Santorum three minutes\u2014which doesn't sound like a lot, but that's a lot of time on television\u2014three minutes to name one accomplishment of Sen. Rubio,\" Christie told the crowd. \"One. Just one. It took him three minutes and he finally came up with that he fought some amendment on Obamacare at one point. Let me tell you, they're saving a place on Mount Rushmore after that one.\"\n\nChristie has hung his presidential hopes on the New Hampshire electorate and spent significant time campaigning there. TPM's PollTracker average shows Christie in sixth place at 4.8 percent.\n\nSantorum responded via Twitter, saying he was \"disappointed\" in \"my friend.\"\n\nDisappointed in @ChrisChristie. Taking my words completely out of context. Expected so much more from my friend. #TeamMarco \u2014 Rick Santorum (@RickSantorum) February 5, 2016\n\nWatch the ad:", "article_metadata": {"p": {"domain_verify": "da088b457e7d0e91a9f692968f1043c1"}, "og": {"site_name": "Talking Points Memo", "description": "New Jersey Gov.
