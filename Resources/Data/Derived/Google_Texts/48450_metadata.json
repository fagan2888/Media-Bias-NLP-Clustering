Not taking cases because they will make a name for her, but because they make sense.\u201d\n\nLynch was born in Greensboro, North Carolina, and grew up in Durham. Her father was a pastor, as was her grandfather; a 2007 article in the legal journal Network News described how her grandfather created \u201chis own version of the Underground Railroad\u201d in the 1930s, to help blacks escape from the Jim Crow laws in the south.\n\nShe studied law at Harvard, and in 1990 started at the Department of Justice in the US attorney\u2019s office for New York\u2019s eastern district, which encompasses Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island as well as Long Island.\n\nShe is probably still best-known for her prosecution of the white police officers who viciously beat and sodomised a Haitian immigrant, Abner Louima, in 1997, in a case that became synonymous with \u2013 and emblematic of \u2013 police brutality in America.\n\nShe had an eight-year stint in the private sector, as a litigator at Hogan and Hartson LLP, during which time she served as special counsel to the prosecution and an investigator in the United Nations\u2019 criminal tribunal for Rwanda. She returned to public service in 2010, when she was nominated by the Obama administration to be US attorney for the eastern district.\n\nUnder her leadership, the US attorney\u2019s office for the eastern district of New York has prosecuted high-profile cases of political corruption, terrorism and police brutality. She won a number of important victories, including the prosecution of Angel Rodriguez, a councilman, and Roger Corbin, a legislator in Nassau County, as well as a raft of city inspectors, all on bribery charges.\n\nShe was lead prosecutor in a series of important political corruption trials involving government of Brookhaven, on Long Island \u2013 a town that became known as \u201cCrookhaven\u201d. More recently, she led the 20-count federal indictment of the Republican congressman from Staten Island, Michael Grimm \u2013 who managed to win re-election in November nonetheless.\n\nIn 2010, Lynch led the indictment of Pedro Espada Jr, a former New York state senate majority leader, who embezzled millions of dollars from Soundview, a free medical clinic in his district.\n\nIt was a case in which Lynch seems to have taken a particular interest. In an illuminating 2013 speech, she spoke of the betrayal of public trust that Espada\u2019s actions personified, as well as the challenges involved in building the case against him. Soundview employees, she said, refused to cooperate with the investigation \u2013 or obstructed it.\n\n\u201cThe tragedy of these cases and these charges goes far beyond those just under indictment,\u201d Lynch said. \u201cConstituents who depend on the organisations that have been corrupted do not receive vital services \u2013 in the case of Soundview this was literally life threatening.\u201d\n\nShe spoke with distaste about Espada\u2019s lavish lifestyle. \u201cInstead of medicine, the money went for luxury cars, extravagant dinners, vacations, parties and spa treatments,\u201d she said. Espada was sentenced to five years\u2019 imprisonment in June 2012.\n\nDaniel Richman, a professor of law at Columbia and a former assistant US attorney in New York\u2019s southern district, told the Guardian that Lynch was someone with deep experience.\n\n\u201cThe particular office she\u2019s in has a broad portfolio of specialisms and interests, which nicely capture the range of things that \u2013 on the criminal side at least \u2013 the attorney general will be focused on,\u201d he said.\n\nRichman said that he expected her confirmation to be relatively easy. \u201cShe is somebody \u2026 without any obvious political failings,\u201d he said. Lynch is not personally connected to Obama, which in the current political climate is a plus.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s very smart, she knows how to surround herself with smart people,\u201d Bennett Capers said. \u201cI think she\u2019s going to be great.\u201d\n\nStephen Rapp, the State Department\u2019s ambassador at large for war crimes issues, and a friend of Lynch, pointed to her recent pro bono work for the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda as an indication of her \u201cdedication to justice\u201d.\n\nLynch traveled to the Tanzania in 2004 to help train African prosecutors for the court and return against in 2005, when Rapp was chief of prosecution at the tribunal, to act as a special prosecutor in a case that saw the conviction of a prosecution witness who had been intimidating fellow witnesses into recanting their testimony.\n\nShe was unpaid and prosecuted the case in her spare time, twice flying out to Tanzania.\n\n\u201cThat says something about her character,\u201d Rapp said. \u201cAt the end of the day that is the most important thing.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#005689", "description": "Colleagues tell of \u2018low-key, very measured\u2019 but influential figure in legal circles, who Eric Holder reportedly lobbied hard for", "application-name": "The Guardian", "author": "Nicky Woolf", "og": {"site_name": "the Guardian", "description": "Colleagues tell of \u2018low-key, very measured\u2019 but influential figure in legal circles, who Eric Holder reportedly lobbied hard for", "title": "Loretta Lynch: level-headed lawyer who flies beneath the radar", "url": "http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/nov/08/loretta-lynch-level-headed-attorney-general", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d6fe2ee90d7ab27625dc28946f5b7489568414e/0_21_3448_2069/2000.jpg?w=1200&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=54d37b88fa09351d78534ab98195c0ed", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"app": {"url": {"ipad": "gnmguardian://us-news/2014/nov/08/loretta-lynch-level-headed-attorney-general?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/nov/08/loretta-lynch-level-headed-attorney-general", "iphone": "gnmguardian://us-news/2014/nov/08/loretta-lynch-level-headed-attorney-general?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}, "id": {"ipad": 409128287, "iphone": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"ipad": "The Guardian", "googleplay": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}}, "creator": "@nickywoolf", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/4d6fe2ee90d7ab27625dc28946f5b7489568414e/0_21_3448_2069/2000.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@guardian"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Guardian", "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://us-news/2014/nov/08/loretta-lynch-level-headed-attorney-general?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "HandheldFriendly": "True", "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287}, "theme-color": "#005689", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/favicons/f06f6996e193d1ddcd614ea852322d25/windows_tile_144_b.png", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "Obama administration,US news,US politics,World news,US constitution and civil liberties,Law", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "published_time": "2014-11-08T16:08:49.000Z", "author": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/nicky-woolf", "section": "US news", "modified_time": "2016-05-11T21:41:07.000Z", "tag": "Obama administration,US news,US politics,World news,US constitution and civil liberties,Law"}, "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d6fe2ee90d7ab27625dc28946f5b7489568414e/0_21_3448_2069/2000.jpg?w=620&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=575579c1c4c129e761583e63f01c8878", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Obama administration,US news,US politics,World news,US constitution and civil liberties,Law"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd351\"", "article_summary": "\u201cNot pushing the envelope, not trying to overreach, but taking a level-headed approach on every case I can think of that the eastern district has brought.\nShe returned to public service in 2010, when she was nominated by the Obama administration to be US attorney for the eastern district.\nUnder her leadership, the US attorney\u2019s office for the eastern district of New York has prosecuted high-profile cases of political corruption, terrorism and police brutality.\nBennett Capers, a professor of law at Brooklyn law school, described Lynch\u2019s style as \u201clow-key, very measured\u201d, and said she liked to play it safe.\nIt was a case in which Lynch seems to have taken a particular interest."}
