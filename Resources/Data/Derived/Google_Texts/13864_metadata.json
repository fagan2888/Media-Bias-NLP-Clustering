Unfortunately, there has been an active reluctance in Congress to think beyond the vote, despite the profound strategic repercussions that will need to be vigorously managed, mitigated, or contained.\n\nJason Grumet\n\nAccording to the Bipartisan Policy Center's Iran Vote Tracker , enough senators now favor the deal to ensure that, even if a motion of disapproval passes, a presidential veto and the deal would stand.\n\nBased on this political reality, it is essential that the agreement's supporters acknowledge the legitimate concerns that have been raised and commit to address them.
