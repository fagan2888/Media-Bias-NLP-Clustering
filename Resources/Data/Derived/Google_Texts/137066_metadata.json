It gives us a different shooting perception.\u201d\n\nAfter the baseball team completed their game, and the Chargers returned to their home gym to join school staff members and fans were they were given a send-off. The players and coaches expressed their appreciation to those who attended.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t lose a game in this gym,\u201d said Collins. \u201cAnd you the fans were a part of it.\u201d\n\nCollins is like rhythm with a microphone in his hand and the music going as he led the way for line dancing performances shared by players, coaches and their supporters.\n\n\u201cCoach is really cool,\u201d said point guard Josh Pride, who played at Huntsville Butler High School. \u201cWe really like him. He\u2019s one of the best coaches I\u2019ve had, too.\u201d\n\nCollins introduced all of the Chargers including those who were unable to play because of injuries or academic issues plus the players who are redshirted.\n\n\u201cThis team has been ranked higher (No. 3) than ever before, maybe higher than any other Tennessee team ever has,\u201d Collins said.\n\nThe opportunity to play in a national event is like a dream comes true for the players.\n\nPride, a co-captain, said, \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to it. I can\u2019t wait to get there.\u201d\n\nT.J. Dunans, the TCCAA \u201cPlayer of the Year,\u201d is eager for the opportunity, too.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what we have been working for all season. I like this chance to play on a national level,\u201d said Dunans, the co-captain from Atlanta.\n\nNow it\u2019s on to \u201cHutch\u201d and Monday\u2019s 8:30 p.m. game against Central Georgia Tech.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A day after a practice session at a different venue and a send-off from their supporters, the Columbia State men\u2019s basketball team departed for Hutchinson, Kan. in quest of a National Championship.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "MARION WILHOITE mwilhoite@c-dh.net", "og": {"site_name": "Columbia Daily Herald", "description": "A day after a practice session at a different venue and a send-off from their supporters, the Columbia State men\u2019s basketball team departed for Hutchinson, Kan. in quest of a National Championship.", "title": "Chargers dance to NJCAA\u2019s \u2018Big Dance\u2019", "url": "http://columbiadailyherald.com/sports/local/chargers-dance-njcaa-s-big-dance", "image": "http://columbiadailyherald.com/sites/columbiadailyherald.com/files/field/media/web1_autographing_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://columbiadailyherald.com/sports/local/chargers-dance-njcaa-s-big-dance", "title": "Chargers dance to NJCAA\u2019s \u2018Big Dance\u2019", "card": "summary", "creator": "@thedailyherald"}, "al": {"web": {"should_fallback": "true"}, "android": {"url": "columbiadailyherald://?eid=804258", "app_name": "columbiadailyherald", "package": "com.stephensmedia.columbiadailyherald"}, "ios": {"url": "columbiadailyherald://?eid=804258", "app_store_id": 964773799, "app_name": "columbiadailyherald"}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=964773799", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.stephensmedia.columbiadailyherald", "keywords": "Local,Local,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-03-15T22:11:18-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=0.9"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWe\u2019ve been taking it one game at a time all year.\u201dThe Chargers had a workout at the Gentry Center on the Tennessee State campus Friday afternoon.\nOf course, 23 other schools will be there vying for the NJCAA Division 1 crown so the road won\u2019t be easy for the Chargers.\nI like this chance to play on a national level,\u201d said Dunans, the co-captain from Atlanta.\nThe opportunity to play in a national event is like a dream comes true for the players.\n\u201cAnd you the fans were a part of it.\u201dCollins is like rhythm with a microphone in his hand and the music going as he led the way for line dancing performances shared by players, coaches and their supporters."}
