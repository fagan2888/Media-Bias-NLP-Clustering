Overall, these mistakes added up to more than $1 billion in unclaimed cash from U.S. taxpayers.\n\nCheck out the eight common tax mistakes Americans are making, so you can avoid them this year.\n\n1. Not itemizing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a mistake that people, especially with good incomes, make,\u201d says Jackie Perlman, senior tax research analyst with the Tax Institute at H&R Block. \u201cPeople don\u2019t itemize because they don\u2019t own a home, but there are other itemized deductions they can take advantage of.\u201d You just have to do the math and see if your deductions are greater than the standard deduction, which depends on your filing status (single, married, head of household, etc.).\n\nRelated: 10 Important Tax Dates for 2016\n\nFor example, taxpayers can deduct state income taxes from their federal returns. That could mean major savings for people who live in states like New York or California with high income-tax rates. Local income taxes can also be deducted. Also, if you had substantial medical expenses or student loan interest, the amount could be enough to lower your taxable income versus only taking the standard deduction. The tuition and fees deduction by itself can reduce taxable income by up to $4,000.\n\n2. Not being prepared.\n\nA lot of mistakes can be avoided by simply organizing your tax information, says Perlman. She recommends that you pull out last year\u2019s return to see what forms you should expect, such how many banks sent 1099 forms the year before recording interest you earned. Keep any records for deductible expenses or donations in one place, so you don\u2019t have to hunt around, especially if you\u2019re a last-minute filer.\n\n3. Not taking education credits.\n\nOnly two-thirds of 18 million people in college claimed one of the higher education tax breaks, according to the 2014 H&R Block study. Two of the breaks are credits, which are more valuable than deductions because credits reduce your actual tax bill.\n\nThe American Opportunity Credit is worth up to $2500 and applies to those who are enrolled at least half-time in the first four years of college or who have kids that are. The second credit is the Lifetime Learning Credit worth up to $2000 and applies to any higher education, even just one course.\n\nRelated: From Boob Jobs to Body Oil, 5 Surprising Tax Deductions\n\n4. Not claiming EITC.\n\nOne in five households that are eligible for the Earned Income Tax Credit don\u2019t claim it on their tax returns, a large enough number that the IRS has created an EITC Awareness Day each year for this specific credit. This EITC credit is worth up to $6,242 for taxpayers with three or more qualifying children and earned income up to $53,267. The credit is also refundable, which means that you receive the credit even if it\u2019s more than the tax on your income, says Perlman. For example, if the tax on your income equals $2,000 and you have a refundable credit of $3,000, then you get a $2,000 credit toward your taxable income (reducing it to zero) plus $1,000 as a refund. That $1,000 would be lost if the credit was non-refundable.\n\n5. Not documenting charitable donations.\n\n\u201cThe mistake people make is not keeping track during the year,\u201d says Perlman. \u201cYou make a $40 donation to the heart fund, you forget all about it and now it\u2019s a year later. You don\u2019t remember how you did it or if you did it.\u201d\n\nRelated: 14 Outrageous Tax Deductions the IRS Denied\n\nPerlman recommends keeping a running record of everything you donate in one place and knowing the IRS rules regarding charitable contributions. Donations under $250 require a canceled check, bank record or receipt from the charity as documentation. Donations valued $250 or more require written acknowledgement from charity that requires a host of specific details found on the IRS website.\n\n6. Not double-checking entries.\n\n\u201cFor DIY people, a tax software program will do the math for you and total everything up, but if you key something in incorrectly, your software doesn\u2019t know that,\u201d Perlman says. The consequences depend on the typos. If you enter a Social Security number incorrectly, the tax return will be rejected and you will have to correct and refile it, without amending the tax return. But if other entries are wrong\u2014such as filing status, credits, deductions or income\u2014you will need to amend your tax return, which is just as fun as filing your original return.\n\n7. Not choosing the right filing status.\n\nChoosing the accurate filing status affects the value of some credits and deductions. In some instances, many married couples\u2014including those who are separated but not yet divorced\u2014would be eligible for more tax breaks and possibly a larger tax refund if they choose the \u201cmarried filing jointly\u201d status versus \u201cmarried filing separate.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, some individuals who file as \u201csingle\u201d may actually qualify as \u201chead of household\u201d status, which offers substantial financial benefits, including a larger standard deduction.\n\n8. Not amending older tax returns.\n\nTaxpayers often think they only need to amend an earlier return if they owe the IRS more money or if there is an error on the return. But you can also amend a return if you realize that you can get a bigger refund by changing your filing status or adding a credit or deduction you left off. The IRS recommends getting your original tax refund first before sending in your amended return. You can amend returns for up to three years from the filing date.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "No one enjoys paying Uncle Sam, but it\u2019s possible you\u2019re shelling out more in taxes th", "title": "The 8 Most Common Tax Mistakes That Can Cost You Hundreds", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/01/21/8-Most-Common-Tax-Mistakes-Can-Cost-You-Hundreds", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02142011_taxes_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/01/21/8-Most-Common-Tax-Mistakes-Can-Cost-You-Hundreds", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02142011_taxes_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "No one enjoys paying Uncle Sam, but it\u2019s possible you\u2019re shelling out more in taxes th", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbcfa\"", "article_summary": "If you enter a Social Security number incorrectly, the tax return will be rejected and you will have to correct and refile it, without amending the tax return.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a mistake that people, especially with good incomes, make,\u201d says Jackie Perlman, senior tax research analyst with the Tax Institute at H&R Block.\nCheck out the eight common tax mistakes Americans are making, so you can avoid them this year.\nA lot of mistakes can be avoided by simply organizing your tax information, says Perlman.\nBut if other entries are wrong\u2014such as filing status, credits, deductions or income\u2014you will need to amend your tax return, which is just as fun as filing your original return."}
