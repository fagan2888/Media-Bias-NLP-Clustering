Don McDonald is a successful psychiatrist in his 60s. By Southern terms he\u2019s not a redneck,\n\nbut if you\u2019re not from the South you might think otherwise. He hunts, fishes, has an old pickup and is frequently politically incorrect, but he also owns a Toyota hybrid, lives in the heart of a big liberal city and is just too damn independent and progressive in his thinking to be a pure-blooded redneck.\n\nAs far as I can tell, when they made Don they threw away the mold.\n\nHe\u2019s also an old jock, a man whose love for sports is eclipsed only by his desire to feel the burn. I\u2019ve said it often before: Don\u2019s addicted to adrenaline, and, these days, he gets his fix mainly through weightlifting and cycling. He\u2019s a tough, tough guy, but now we\u2019re circling back around to his political incorrectness, so let\u2019s move on.\n\nHe\u2019s also voted Democrat through most if not all his life \u2014 which is why I was a bit taken back by his praise for Donald Trump.\n\nAccording to my brother, Trump is succeeding because he speaks truth to power, and people are finding that to be refreshing \u2014 a big attraction in a field full of professional politicians. My brother doesn\u2019t necessarily believe what Trump\u2019s saying. In fact, he told me that if Trump were to truly seek to repeal Obamacare, as he says he would, he wouldn\u2019t support him, since my brother the doctor says it\u2019s helping the working poor get the coverage they need.\n\nBut my brother believes Trump\u2019s pragmatism would \u201ctrump\u201d his own rhetoric if he really were to be elected President.\n\nI don\u2019t see it that way, and I told him so. I ranted for a moment about the dangers of his nationalistic and prejudicial rhetoric, and Don didn\u2019t really disagree. Instead, he simply said he likes him anyway, because he\u2019s the only one telling it like it is.\n\nThen he dropped another bombshell on me. \u201cI voted for Bernie Sanders,\u201d he said.\n\nWhat the hell? Here\u2019s an independent-thinking, liberal-leaning, Southern white man who is attracted both of this year\u2019s party extremes. Talk about an unconventional year.\n\nBoth Trump and Sanders, Don argued, are leading \u201cnonviolent revolutions\u201d that America needs during these dysfunctional political times. Sanders is taking on Wall Street and that needs to happen, he said, and he gets away with calling himself a democratic socialist because people are tired of candidates don\u2019t tell it like they truly see it.\n\nSo how will my bro vote if it comes down to Trump vs. Clinton? \u201cProbably for Hillary,\u201d he said, because he disagrees with Trump\u2019s rhetoric on most of the issues, and really isn\u2019t qualified to be president. And Hillary\u2019s clearly qualified, he said, so that would probably sway him in her favor.\n\nI wonder if brother is the only Trump-Sanders supporter out there. He certainly has a point about the revolutions taking root on both the left and the right. Crazy as it might seem, a Trump-Sanders ticket would certainly get his vote.\n\nTom McDonald is editor of the New Mexico Community News Exchange.
