WALSENBURG, Colo. (AP) - An old high school football field in Walsenburg in south Colorado will soon become a housing development unlike almost any other in the country.

Later this month, a developer will break ground on the first of 28 tiny houses planned on the three-acre lot.

The homes will be less than 500 square feet.

Walsenburg Mayor James Eccher tells Colorado Public Radio that he was skeptical at first about the idea, but ultimately, he decided that more homeowners paying property taxes and utility bills can only be a good thing for the community.

The Colorado Municipal League says many of its members are watching Walsenburg's tiny house experiment with interest. If it takes off, the state could see other cities getting on board with going small.
