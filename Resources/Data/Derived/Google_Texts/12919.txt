The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the first 3D printed drug, which can be used to treat epilepsy, Aprecia Pharmaceuticals Company said Monday. By using 3D printing, the oral drug, called Spritam, is made of porous material and is able to disintegrate quickly with water. Some epilepsy patients have difficulty swallowing traditional drugs or caretakers have difficulties getting children to take medication, the company said in a statement. The drug also carries a high drug load, so that patients may only have to take one pill. Aprecia Pharmaceuticals plans to create more "central nervous system products," the company said.
