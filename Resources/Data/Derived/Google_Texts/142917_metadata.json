Charlie Baker, a Republican, plans to greet President Barack Obama, a Democrat, at the airport on Monday, when the president arrives in Massachusetts to attend a union Labor Day breakfast.\n\n\"I'm going to greet him at the airport because first of all, I think that's the right thing to do,\" Baker told reporters on Wednesday. \"Secondly, any time the president comes to visit Massachusetts, if I can get there and greet him or her when they arrive, I want to be there.\"\n\nBaker said he has no other plans to meet with Obama during his visit.\n\nObama is a friend of Baker's predecessor, former Democratic governor Deval Patrick. First Lady Michelle Obama campaigned against Baker last fall before Baker defeated Democrat Martha Coakley.\n\nBaker has had mixed success on requests he has made to the federal government since taking office relating to federal disaster aid and to the national health care law, the Affordable Care Act.\n\nObama will speak at the 2015 Greater Boston Labor Council Labor Day Breakfast at the Boston Park Plaza Hotel on Monday morning.\n\nRich Rogers, the executive secretary-treasurer of the Greater Boston Labor Council, in a statement cited the victories organized labor has had in Massachusetts in increasing the minimum wage, passing a domestic workers bill of rights and ensuring all workers receive earned sick time. \"For the President to be joining us in Boston on Labor Day following such a momentous year is a great honor and we look forward to celebrating our shared commitment to raising standards for all working people,\" Rogers said.\n\nBaker has not been popular with the state's unions, after he opposed a 2014 ballot initiative requiring employers to provide earned sick time and has recently tried to privatize some bus service at the MBTA.\n\nBaker has not made an endorsement in the Republican presidential primary for 2016. Whenever he is asked about national presidential politics, Baker says he was elected to focus primarily on Massachusetts.", "article_metadata": {"article_author": "Shira Schoenberg | sschoenberg@repub.com", "medium": "news", "news_keywords": "Charlie Baker (baseball), Barack Obama, barack-obama, charlie-baker, labor, labor-day, politics, unions, news", "title": "Gov.
