That\u2019s two weeks longer than the traditional, annual break.\n\nRelated: Where in the World Is Congress Spending Its Summer Vacation?\n\nThe House will also be out for all of October, as incumbents and challengers work for victory at the polls. Winners and defeated lame-ducks will return to Capitol Hill on November 14, one week after Election Day.\n\nIn all, the House will be in session for 111 days next year, and out of town for 149 days. That workload is similar to 2012 when the House was in for only 109 days.\n\n\"This calendar ensures that 'the People's House' always remains in-touch with those back home,\u201d McCarthy said in a statement. \"Discussing ideas and concerns is a critical function of a responsive, representative democracy, and for this reason, our schedule will continue to provide members considerable time for constituent services in their districts each month.\"\n\nRelated: Revolving Door Between Congress and Lobbyists Is Speeding Up\n\nTrue, they\u2019ll be spending time in their districts, but they will also be fundraising and electioneering, especially in July.\n\nThat month both the GOP and Democrats gather for their presidential conventions in Cleveland and Philadelphia, respectively. The House has just nine workdays slated in July.\n\nThe Senate hasn\u2019t released its 2016 calendar, and the House schedule could always change, depending on what, if any, unexpected legislative issues crop up. But the anticipated light workload doesn\u2019t bode well for getting much done during the coming election year and could wreak havoc as lawmakers work on appropriations bills to keep the government open past an October 1 deadline.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Campaigns are time-consuming, especially during a high-stakes presidential election year as both national parties strive for supremacy in a battle that has the potential to trickle all the way down to county and municipal level tickets.", "title": "The House Is Giving Itself Some Time Off in 2016.
