I had a mulligan. Didn\u2019t dress most of the time. I told myself I wasn\u2019t going to be in that position again, watching on Sundays.\u201d\n\nHe matched his 2012 total in the Broncos\u2019 opener by catching a 28-yard touchdown pass from Peyton Manning early in the third quarter in a 49-27 victory against Baltimore.\n\nCaldwell is known among his teammates more by his nickname \u201cBubba\u201d than his given name. He had emerged as a solid No. 3 receiver for the Cincinnati Bengals from 2009-11, catching 113 passes and six touchdowns in those seasons.\n\nHe signed a two-year contract with the Broncos, but 25 days later the team brought back Brandon Stokley to become Manning\u2019s No. 3 receiver. When Manning invited Demaryius Thomas, Eric Decker and Stokley\u2019s replacement, Wes Welker, to a passing session at Duke University in April, Caldwell communicated through Twitter he felt slighted.\n\nThe Broncos liked that. Caldwell\u2019s touchdown catch against the Ravens wasn\u2019t vindication, exactly, but a reward.\n\n\u201cIt showed that hard work paid off,\u201d Caldwell said. \u201cI never gave up. I always kept fighting and kept working. I knew if I ever got a chance again that I would make the most of it.\u201d\n\nHave potential, will travel. On Aug. 22, linebacker Adrian Robinson was a member of the Pittsburgh Steelers, who played him in 10 games as a rookie last season to use up his practice-squad eligibility.\n\nOn Aug. 23, Robinson was traded to Philadelphia.\n\nOn Sept. 1, Robinson was claimed off waivers by the Broncos. Three teams in 10 days. He played special teams in the Broncos\u2019 season opener Thursday.\n\n\u201cIt makes me feel like the NFL still wants me,\u201d Robinson said. \u201cA lot of people see something in me. I\u2019m happy I\u2019m in the NFL. I\u2019m happy God gave me a second and third chance.\u201d\n\nFootnotes. It will be Giants tight end Adrien Robinson and Broncos linebacker Adrian Robinson Sunday at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey. \u2026 Manning is 2-0 in head-to-head games against his younger brother and Giants quarterback Eli Manning. Peyton and Eli are tied in Super Bowl appearances, each with two. But Eli has a 2-1 edge in Super Bowl victories. \u2026 The Broncos have won 12 regular-season games in a row, six of them on the road.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Broncos\u2019 Andre Caldwell off to better start with TD catch in opener", "title": "Broncos\u2019 Andre Caldwell off to better start with TD catch in opener", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/09/10/broncos-andre-caldwell-off-to-better-start-with-td-catch-in-opener/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130905__Andre-Caldwell-broncos-fans-090513p1.jpg", "height": 410}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130905__Andre-Caldwell-broncos-fans-090513p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-11T01:21:05+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T16:03:45+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "He played special teams in the Broncos\u2019 season opener Thursday.\nAndre Caldwell arrived in Denver last season with proven NFL production, a popular nickname and a decent contract.\n\u2026 Manning is 2-0 in head-to-head games against his younger brother and Giants quarterback Eli Manning.\nIt will be Giants tight end Adrien Robinson and Broncos linebacker Adrian Robinson Sunday at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey.\n\u2026 The Broncos have won 12 regular-season games in a row, six of them on the road."}
