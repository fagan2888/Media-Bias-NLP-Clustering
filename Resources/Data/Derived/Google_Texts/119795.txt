On Saturday, Judge Jeanine Pirro, host of the Fox News Channel’s “Justice with Judge Jeanine” railed against Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber for his comments insulting the intelligence of the American people.

“They think you’re stupid, that they can pull the wool over your eyes. They know more than you do. And that they know what’s good for you and it’s best to simply keep you in the dark. So, why lie to the American people? And make no mistake, we were lied to. Starting with ‘you can keep your health care plan and your doctor,’ to ‘this isn’t a tax, it’s just a penalty’” she said.

Pirro reacted to the White House’s attempt to distance itself from Gruber, by pointing out “records confirm that Gruber spent time at the White House and Gruber himself says he met with the president twice, including in the Oval Office to discuss the law. Hey, Gruber, Americans aren’t stupid. We knew all along that Obamacare was nothing more than an attempt to socialize medicine and tax us to pay for this redistribution of wealth.”

She concluded that “if they think that we can’t see that this is simply a transfer of wealth from those who have insurance to those who don’t, from the young and healthy to those who are old and sick, a transfer of wealth from legals to illegals, then they’re the ones who are stupid.”
