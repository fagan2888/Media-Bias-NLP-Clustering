He sprained it late last season and missed the last six games because of it, and further tests after the season showed more damage than just a simple sprain. The upshot of it all was Lawson could not run until July and was not able to do a full offseason conditioning program in the manner he wanted.\n\nHe will wear a small brace on it on-and-off all season long. And in a season with 21 back-to-backs and a good number of four-games-in-five-nights sets, it will be under constant stress. How much Lawson is used, and how Lawson takes care of himself as well, is already on Shaw\u2019s mind.\n\n\u201cThere is some concern,\u201d Shaw said. \u201cI haven\u2019t really been killing him in practice or even in games. I\u2019m cognizant of that. But once again, it\u2019s something that he\u2019s going to have to work himself through.\u201d\n\nAsked if he\u2019d rest Lawson in any of the preseason games, Shaw said, \u201cIt\u2019s a possibility. It\u2019s that fine line because you want guys to continue to build up their stamina and their conditioning and be sharp. Kenneth (Faried) kind of got his game this last game (at Phoenix). If Ty just really busts out and has a big game and is showing me that \u2018Okay, I\u2019m ready\u2019 then maybe I\u2019ll feel better about doing something like that.\u201d\n\nNo carbon footprint. The Nuggets are going on the road for a full week in the preseason this week, something they\u2019ll only have to do a couple of times in the regular season.\n\nBut with a game on Thursday after the Nuggets\u2019 Monday contest in Chicago, why keep his team on the road?\n\nShaw smiled and said, \u201cI\u2019m trying to be energy-efficient. We\u2019ll stay in Chicago and practice a couple of days. Because (it saves) the fuel that it would take to fly back and then pack up and fly back again.\u201d\n\nSo he\u2019s helping the environment?\n\n\u201cI am,\u201d Shaw said. \u201cI\u2019m doing my part.\u201d\n\nChristopher Dempsey: cdempsey@denverpost.com or Follow @dempseyPost\n\n", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Brian Shaw,Chris Dempsey,Nuggets,preseason,Ty Lawson", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/2014/10/12/brian-shaw-vows-keep-close-eye-ty-lawson-ankle/11752/", "site_name": "Nuggets Ink", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/files/2014/10/ty-lawson-vs-suns-preseason.jpg", "type": "blog", "title": "Brian Shaw to keep a close eye on Ty Lawson's ankle issues"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "title": "Brian Shaw vows to keep a close eye on Ty Lawson and his ankle", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/2014/10/12/brian-shaw-vows-keep-close-eye-ty-lawson-ankle/11752/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/files/2014/10/ty-lawson-vs-suns-preseason.jpg", "creator": "@dempseyPost", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "language": "en, sv", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Ty Lawson has an ankle, originally injured last season, that will need constant attention this season."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca0e5\"", "article_summary": "But once again, it\u2019s something that he\u2019s going to have to work himself through.\u201dAsked if he\u2019d rest Lawson in any of the preseason games, Shaw said, \u201cIt\u2019s a possibility.\nHow much Lawson is used, and how Lawson takes care of himself as well, is already on Shaw\u2019s mind.\nAnd in a season with 21 back-to-backs and a good number of four-games-in-five-nights sets, it will be under constant stress.\nBut with a game on Thursday after the Nuggets\u2019 Monday contest in Chicago, why keep his team on the road?\nLawson\u2019s ankle will be one to watch this season."}
