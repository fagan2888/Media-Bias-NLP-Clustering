Florida police have charged Donald Trump's campaign manager Corey Lewandowski with simple assault in connection with an incident earlier in the month involving a reporter.

Police in Jupiter, Florida issued Lewandowski a notice Tuesday to appear before a judge on May 4 for the misdemeanor charge. A surveillance video released by the police appears to show Lewandowski grabbing a reporter for Breitbart News as she tried to ask Trump a question during a March 8 campaign event.

The police report states: "Lewandowski grabbed (Michelle) Fields' left arm with his right hand causing her to turn and step back." Fields showed police her left forearm which "appeared to show a grabbing-type injury," according to the investigating officer.

Donald Trump says his campaign manager is "absolutely innocent" following a decision by Florida police to charge him with battery.

The Republican front-runner issued a statement Tuesday after Jupiter, Florida, police charged Corey Lewandowski with battery for an incident involving a reporter earlier in the month.

A video surveillance tape obtained by The Associated Press appears to show Lewandowski grabbing Michelle Fields' arm as she tried to ask Trump a question at a March 8 event.

Trump said Lewandowski "will enter a plea of not guilty and looks forward to his day in court. He is completely confident that he will be exonerated."

Lewandowski has retained an attorney in West Palm Beach.
