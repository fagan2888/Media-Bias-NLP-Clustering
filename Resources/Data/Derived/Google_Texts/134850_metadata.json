Daley, three have retired.\n\nChicago police officers implicated in the wake of a political scandal within the Chicago Police Department, or CPD, have retired, dodging disciplinary action while holding on to pensions worth more than $100,000 a year, the Chicago Sun-Times reports.\n\nNearly two months ago, Mayor Rahm Emanuel\u2019s administration received a report from the office of Chicago Inspector General Joe Ferguson that advocated for discipline \u2013 including termination \u2013 for six police officers.\n\nEach was involved in an alleged cover-up of a 2004 involuntary manslaughter case wherein Richard Vanecko, a nephew of former Mayor Richard M. Daley, punched David Koschman in the face, leaving him comatose on the street. Koschman died 11 days later. Vanecko pled guilty to involuntary manslaughter in January 2014.\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\nSince Ferguson delivered his report \u2013 one that Chicago police unions fought to derail \u2013 three of the officers he recommended for discipline have retired and are set to collect large pension payouts.\n\nThe Sun-Times reported that police in 2004 began investigating Vanecko\u2019s assault of Koschman, who did not die immediately of the injuries he sustained. The investigating officers stopped looking into the case within hours, however, and only started up again after Koschman\u2019s death 11 days later. When law enforcement brought in some of Koschman\u2019s friends to identify a suspect, they couldn\u2019t point out the 6-foot-3, 230-pound Vanecko in a lineup filled with even larger police officers. The department tabled the case and did not charge Vanecko.\n\nIn 2011, a series of reports by the Chicago Sun-Times prompted the re-opening of the case. But police quickly closed it, determining Vanecko had acted in self-defense. This led Koschman\u2019s mother to request a special prosecutor in the case; a Cook County circuit judge granted her request and appointed Dan Webb to the role.\n\nWebb found evidence that after the case was re-opened, former Chief of Detectives Dean Andrews \u2013 who supervised the re-investigation \u2013 and Sargent Sam Cirone sent personal emails containing a fabricated statement from an unidentified witness claiming Koschman had yelled obscenities at Vanecko.\n\nWebb found no evidence of any witness ever giving such a statement, yet it was included in Detective James Gilger\u2019s report of the incident. Gilger\u2019s 2011 report concluded Vanecko had acted in self-defense and recommended the case be closed, even though friends of Koschman disputed that claim and detectives never spoke with Vanecko.\n\nThe Sun-Times reports that of the six Chicago police officers singled out for discipline by Ferguson for their roles in the 2011 investigation, three have retired since Ferguson delivered the report.\n\nAndrews, 51, and former Commander Joseph Salemme, 56, retired in early December 2015. Salemme was named 52 times in Webb\u2019s report, while Andrews was named 114 times, according to the Sun-Times. Reporters Tim Novak and Chris Fusco say Andrews and Salemme are getting pensions that \u201ctop $100,000 a year.\u201d\n\nThey also report that Gilger announced his last day would be Jan. 31. His salary as of September 2015 was more than $125,000.\n\nThese three men are therefore no longer subject to discipline. If the three remaining officers still on the city payroll \u2013 including Cirone \u2013 choose to retire, they won\u2019t be either.\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, many of the key officers and other CPD officials involved in the initial 2004 investigation of the Koschman case have retired.\n\nA Chicago Tribune poll found that over 60 percent of Chicagoans think cover-ups and a code of silence are \u201ca widespread problem\u201d within CPD.\n\nNews like this isn\u2019t helping.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Since Chicago officials received a city watchdog investigation recommending six officers be disciplined for their roles surrounding the killing of David Koschman by a nephew of former Mayor Richard M.
