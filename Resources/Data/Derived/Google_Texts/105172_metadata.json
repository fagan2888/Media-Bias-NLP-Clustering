In fact, employee friendliness, knowledge and empathy may be the primary reason why your customers return. Yes, employees are \u201cthe face of your business\u201d; because they are often the only point of contact with your customers. Unfortunately, you won\u2019t be able continually to provide that exceptional service or expand your business unless you can constantly recruit new team members that understand the needs of your customers. And the best way to ensure that is to actually recruit your existing best customers, who obviously already know about customer\u2019s needs and they like your unique approach to business.\n\nData from the corporate world reveals that recruiting has the largest measurable impact on revenue of all human resources actions. In fact, formerly small firms like Uber and Google quickly became dominant firms by realizing that \u201chiring is the most important thing you do.\u201d Fortunately there\u2019s one recruiting area where small firms can easily \u201cmirror\u201d the approaches of powerhouse firms like Nike, Pier 1, Harley-Davidson, Microsoft and Wells Fargo. And that approach can be described as, \u201crecruit your customers because they share your passion.\u201d\n\nFor example, if you wanted your firm to grow dramatically like Duck Dynasty, would you recruit grads with advanced degrees or would you exclusively hire individuals that buy your product because they shared your passion for everything related to duck hunting?\n\nThe key is to recruit customers that like your product or firm, that share your values and that can closely connect and relate to other customers. Also recruit your customers because they reflect the diversity of your customer base, they already have a rapport with your staff, and they can sell your product or service better because they have personal stories resulting from using them. And finally, they will need less orientation and training and they\u2019re less likely to quit because they already know what to expect. Incidentally, hiring customers is superior to hiring \u201cfriends\u201d, because customers don\u2019t have the emotional or friendship ties that make managing friends difficult.\n\nSourcing and communicating with your target customers is easy because they may visit your facility or contact you online as often as every week. Candidate assessment is likely to be more accurate because, unlike most recruits who are \u201cstrangers,\u201d you and your employees may have known these customer targets for years. Customers are often easier to sell on your job because they probably live close by and they will likely have little fear of \u201cfitting in.\u201d And if a target customer is not currently interested, ask them to be a referral source for others they know who would be a perfect fit. And finally, don\u2019t mistakenly think that customers with corporate jobs wouldn\u2019t consider working for a small business.\n\nYou may be surprised to learn that many would gladly leave \u201cthe corporate rat race\u201d and jump at the opportunity to work in a \u201cfamily-like environment\u201d where they can make a difference.\n\nJohn Sullivan has been a professor of management for over 26 years at San Francisco State University.
