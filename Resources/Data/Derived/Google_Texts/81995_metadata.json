Scott Tipton, R-Colo., would put up road blocks to stop the federal government from re- asserting greater control over ski-area water rights.\n\nInitially, it might sound like a no-brainer. Of course the government should allow the ski areas to keep water rights so they can keep producing the snow that is such an economic and recreational boon, right?\n\nUnfortunately, it\u2019s not that simple.\n\nThe U.S. Forest Service is attempting to re-establish stewardship of rights for water that originates on federal land. The goal is to ensure water stays with the public land used by resorts, even if ownership of the resort changes.\n\nBeginning about 30 years ago in the region that includes Colorado, federal authorities started requiring ski-area permit holders to put water rights from public lands in the government\u2019s name.\n\nIn 2004, the Bush administration changed policy, allowing ski areas to jointly hold water rights. When the Forest Service, under Obama, tried to change permit conditions to more closely follow historic practice in the Colorado region, the ski industry sued.\n\nA federal judge ruled in 2012 that the process used to make permit changes was deficient.\n\nFortunately, there is room for compromise without another legal battle.\n\nThe Forest Service is creating, but has not yet released, a new ski-area water rights clause that could provide a solution. A solid compromise would be to allow resorts to keep water rights ownership, but require that the water remain with the land, regardless of whether ski resorts changed hands or business plans.\n\nWhen released this spring, the draft will go through a full public vetting process, as it should.\n\nEntire Colorado mountain towns and economies depend upon recreation on federal land, and it\u2019s vital to ensure the people, through their government, retain control of the water that is the lifeblood of those communities.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Reject bill on ski area water rights", "title": "Reject bill on ski area water rights", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/03/14/reject-bill-on-ski-area-water-rights/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140314__20140316_D3_OP16E_WATERRIGHTSp1.jpg", "height": 484}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140314__20140316_D3_OP16E_WATERRIGHTSp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-03-14T13:27:28+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T00:59:55+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfe8c\"", "article_summary": "The Forest Service is creating, but has not yet released, a new ski-area water rights clause that could provide a solution.\nPresident Obama on Wednesday issued a statement opposing the Water Rights Protection Act, which passed Thursday in the U.S. House but must still go to the Senate.\nThe bill, sponsored by Rep.
