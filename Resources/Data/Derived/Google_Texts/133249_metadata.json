Yet, as Politico\u2019s Kathryn A. Wolfe reported, the deadly crash occurred just as a House panel was set to mark up a bill that would cut Amtrak\u2019s funding for 2016 to $1.13 billion, or about $250 million less than the railroad service typically gets. (To be fair, it\u2019s also not clear at this point what caused the horrific Amtrak derailment and whether infrastructure problems played a part or not \u2014 and the number of rail accidents each year has actually fallen significantly since 2006, according to Federal Railroad Administration data.)\n\nRelated: At Least 6 Die in Philadelphia Train Derailment, Scores Hurt\n\nEven before the Amtrak tragedy, though, de Blasio and Oklahoma City Mayor Mick Cornett, a Republican, along with some two dozen other mayors were scheduled to travel to Washington, D.C. today to press Congress for a long-term renewal of the federal transportation authorization bill. The current funding law is set to expire May 31.\n\nPretty much everyone agrees that it\u2019s well past time for the country to repair and rebuild its dangerously dated bridges, roads, railways, water mains and other critical infrastructure. The hold-up has always been over how to fund it.\n\nHere\u2019s one suggestion: The U.S. has spent some $110 billion on rebuilding Afghanistan, including billions that can\u2019t be accounted for or that the inspector general has found have been wasted. That\u2019s a drop in the bucket compared to the trillions in domestic infrastructure spending that some have called for. Still, clamping down on that waste in Afghanistan, and on other money being frittered away, might allow for some spending to be redirected to other necessary and more productive needs, like domestic infrastructure.\n\nThat\u2019s not to suggest we must entirely abandon nation building abroad in order to rebuild this country. It\u2019s just to point out that Congress should be able to find the money to address our national priorities, something it has miserably failed to do of late.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The Amtrak derailment in Philadelphia that left six people dead and dozens more injured has already prompted calls for increased infrastructure spending. \"This one is a wake-up call,\" New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said Wednesday on MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe. \"We have got to get serious about investing in infrastructure.\"", "title": "After the Amtrak Crash: Finding the Money to Fix Our Infrastructure", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/05/13/After-Amtrak-Crash-Finding-Money-Fix-Our-Infrastructure", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/05132015_Derailed_Amtrak_Train.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/05/13/After-Amtrak-Crash-Finding-Money-Fix-Our-Infrastructure", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/05132015_Derailed_Amtrak_Train.jpg", "creator": "@yuvalrosenberg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The Amtrak derailment in Philadelphia that left six people dead and dozens more injured has already prompted calls for increased infrastructure spending. \"This one is a wake-up call,\" New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said Wednesday on MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe. \"We have got to get serious about investing in infrastructure.\"", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "The Amtrak derailment in Philadelphia that left six people dead and dozens more injured has already prompted calls for increased infrastructure spending.\nThat\u2019s a drop in the bucket compared to the trillions in domestic infrastructure spending that some have called for.\nThere have been other wake-up calls before, and the dire need for infrastructure renewal isn\u2019t news.\n\"This one is a wake-up call,\" New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said Wednesday on MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe.\n\"We have got to get serious about investing in infrastructure.\""}
