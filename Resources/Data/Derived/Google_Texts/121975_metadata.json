Some lack adequate training and find the care they are expected to provide overwhelming. (Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nUPDATED: The Assembly passed the CARE Act on June 1. Now it's up to the governor to sign the legislation.\n\nHospitalizations are getting shorter, with patients often sent home with detailed medical instructions to complete their treatment. Family members, and sometimes friends, are tapped as caregivers. But there's no built-in training for caregivers when a loved one leaves a hospital or other medical facility and heads home with a stack of prescriptions and a set of care instructions.\n\nAARP chapters in various states have advocated for legislation that would ensure caregivers are offered training for the tasks ahead. The CARE Act would aid quality of life for those who are sick, and ease the stress for those who are caring for them. Plus, it could save money, because fewer patients would have to be readmitted and need costly extended care.\n\nComplex chronic care\n\nThe Caregiver Advise, Record, Enable, or CARE Act has been passed in several states, including Oklahoma, New Jersey and Virginia. The push for the state laws came from a study, \"Home Alone: Family Caregivers Providing Complex Chronic Care,\" undertaken by AARP Public Policy Institute and the United Hospital Fund.\n\nThe 2012 caregiver study found that the tasks performed by caregivers went way beyond cleaning and cooking. People are sent home from medical facilities needing help with IV therapy administration, wound care and other medical duties that once were peformed by trained hospital staff. With an aging population like we have in the Lower Hudson Valley, more families will be tapped to fulfill such challenging care. The AARP study found three-quarters of caregivers studied were managing medication, including administering intravenous treatment. Many said they wanted more training for tasks like wound care.\n\nNew York's CARE Act ensures that a hospital or care facility would:\n\n\u2022 Record the name of the family caregiver when a loved one is admitted into a hospital.\n\n\u2022 Notify the family caregiver if the loved one is to be discharged to another facility or home.\n\n\u2022 Prepare the family caregiver to perform such medical tasks as handling medication, injections, wound care and other tasks.\n\nCut costly readmissions\n\nThorough caregiver training is in the best interest of a hospital, because readmissions can be costly. Under the Affordable Care Act, hospitals with high readmission rates are penalized with cuts in Medicare reimbursements.\n\nMany hospitals already ensure their patients' family members receive adequate training. Dr. Gordon Liebergall, a retired eye doctor, said his patients received great support and training when he was affiliated with Good Samaritan Hospital in Suffern. But not all facilities, he said, provide such care, and \"there's things that slip through even at quality hospitals.\"\n\nCalling Medicare readmission penalties \"a real crusher for the hospital,\" Liebergall said the CARE Act helps medical facilities, as well as families.\n\nThe CARE Act would add a few check boxes to the admissions paperwork. But it would provide a safety net for families, better quality-of-life for the patient and a better service model for hospitals. Amid this mess of a legislative session, the Senate and Assembly were able to pass the CARE Act; Gov. Andrew Cuomo should sign the bill and provide a real service to New Yorkers.\n\nmore\n\nTo view the CARE Act, go to nysenate.gov, and click on Legislation and add the bill number \u2013 S676 or A01323 \u2013 in the Open Legislation window.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://lohud.us/1I13udF", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Training for caregivers saves families stress, and cuts hospital readmissions.
