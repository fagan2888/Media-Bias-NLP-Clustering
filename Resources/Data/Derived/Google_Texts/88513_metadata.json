Among his duties: advocating for the organization\u2019s member institutions to legislators in Carson City.\n\nThe Nevada Health Care Association has grown significantly over the past year. What is the expected growth over the next few years?\n\nWe expect to represent post-acute care providers in Nevada to help improve care in the state. With the passing of the IMPACT 14 legislation in Congress last fall, we are drawn together more than ever and will be measured by the quality of care we deliver.\n\nHow has care in nursing facilities changed over the past year?\n\nOur quality measures have improved across the state. One reason has been the evidence-based education we\u2019ve been able to provide, specifically targeting facilities that weren\u2019t performing as well as others. One example is the improvement of the Minimum Data Set (MDS) accuracy rate for such facilities in Nevada from 74 percent to 82 percent. The MDS is part of the federally mandated process for clinical assessment of all residents in Medicare or Medicaid-certified nursing homes. This process provides a comprehensive assessment of each resident\u2019s functional capabilities and helps nursing home staff identify health problems. We still have much work to do, but we\u2019ve been making solid progress recently.\n\nWhat does the NVHCA Perry Foundation do?\n\nThe Perry Foundation analyzes compliance and \u201cOnline Survey, Certification and Reporting\u201d (OSCAR) data and then formulates specific education for providers. Sometimes education is engineered specifically for a single provider when asked.\n\nHow can people advocate for better nursing home care?\n\nConsumers can affect care in a post-acute setting by participating in the provider\u2019s care plan programming and having open communication with the caregivers. People who want to advocate for residents or patients in a post-acute care setting such as local nursing homes should focus on outcomes or quality measures. In looking at the data and knowing the reimbursement history for Medicare and Medicaid, what needs to happen is obvious. We need to increase the reimbursement rate the state provides to such facilities, which is something we are encouraging state leaders to do during the legislative session this year.\n\nWhat would improve health care in Nevada?\n\nMedicaid and Medicare rate increase for providers would be the biggest thing, as well as training and education for providers on how to improve the quality measures already in place. We need more clinicians, including nurses and therapists.\n\nWhat is the most challenging part of your job?\n\nGetting consensus with providers. Now that we represent more than just Nevada\u2019s skilled nursing and assisted-living providers, getting folks to agree on how to implement the changes compelled by the Affordable Care Act is troubling to all providers in different ways.\n\nWhat has been the most rewarding part of your job?\n\nSuccess in improving how Nevada is ranked nationally in health care. I also enjoy meeting the providers and consumers, especially in educational forums, and seeing the \u201clight\u201d come on for them when we discuss quality of care and related issues.\n\nWhat are you reading right now?\n\nI have been reading mainly proposed legislation. I am looking for my next read. More than likely, it will be a biography or historical book. I also read some science fiction on summer vacation.\n\nWhat do you do after work?\n\nWork! I enjoy target practice, water sports, motorcycle riding and hunting, for the most part. With three kids in college and one in high school, most of my activities are in support of their activities.\n\nBlackberry, iPhone or Android?\n\nAndroid.\n\nDescribe your management style.\n\nChaotic mostly, with lots of interruptions. I will set an expectation for employees, and it is up to them to figure out how to get it done. My style has changed from when I ran skilled nursing facilities to what I do now. Trying to get consensus on an issue is different than directing care as a provider. I am more of a shepherd now than a dictator, when I was responsible for hundreds of souls, including employees and residents.\n\nWhere do you see yourself and the association in 10 years?\n\nDoing exactly the same job, improving care here in Nevada.\n\nWhat is your dream job, outside of your current field?\n\nA hunting and fishing guide or motorcycle instructor.\n\nWhom do you admire and why?\n\nGov. Brian Sandoval. His commitment to health care and behavioral health in Nevada is great. With his support, Nevada can raise its standing nationally.\n\nWhat is your biggest pet peeve?\n\nHow some people treat service employees or members of the armed forces. It amazes me how poorly some people treat the ones who make our lives better. In a health care facility, the people who work in the laundry and housekeeping departments are often forgotten until there is an issue. In a facility, the administrator or director of nursing can have a bad day without much impact. If the laundry goes down, the entire facility feels it immediately.\n\nWhat is something people might not know about you?\n\nI surf on Lake Mead in the summer and consider myself a pretty good cook.\n\nAnything else you want to tell us?\n\nI like to say, \u201cEveryone has two stories, a motorcycle story and a nursing home story, both ending poorly. I\u2019m trying to change that.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "The Sunday", "og": {"site_name": "VegasInc.com", "description": "The president and CEO of the Nevada Health Care Association talks about what people can do to affect nursing home care, what would improve health care in Nevada and why it\u2019s important to treat people in the service industry and armed forces with respect.", "title": "When it comes to health care, Nevada needs more of just about everything", "url": "//vegasinc.com/business/2015/apr/05/when-it-comes-health-care-nevada-needs-more-just-a/", "image": "//media.vegasinc.com/assets/images/icons/vi-app-300.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"account_id": 29825057, "card": "summary", "site": "@VegasINC"}, "fb": {"app_id": 199953030039639}, "google-site-verification": "bxp1knjJzNHgVqXi0tkBFqhiRQYP6Xmg5IYDJk824_c", "msvalidate.01": "E1BCF7923471E63B3CC7DDA3DE4A41FB", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-05T02:00", "author": "//vegasinc.com/staff/vegas-inc-staff/"}, "verify-v1": "ABQIAAAA8L3JFDSZBbRKiOI0oC2hURQ76jIbcG_lJjmaPhfMbLI5tEWvABRborWeQmxtOOd3YJzakYNqhBoeFQ", "y_key": "33c272341f5beade", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Sunday, April 5, 2015 | 2 a.m. - The president and CEO of the Nevada Health Care Association talks about what people can do to affect nursing home care, what would improve health ..."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0659\"", "article_summary": "The Nevada Health Care Association has grown significantly over the past year.\nHis commitment to health care and behavioral health in Nevada is great.\nWe expect to represent post-acute care providers in Nevada to help improve care in the state.\nWhat would improve health care in Nevada?\nIn 2012, Daniel Mathis became president and CEO of the Nevada Health Care Association, a nonprofit organization that works to improve the quality of care in Nevada\u2019s nursing homes."}
