She asserted Ms. Clinton would push through legislation that would allow Puerto Rican municipalities to declare bankruptcy, easing the country\u2019s massive $70 billion public debt burden.\n\n\u201cFor Puerto Ricans\u2014both on the island and throughout the diaspora\u2014this election the most important in our lifetime. Hillary\u2019s plan has shown she is not just a friend to the island; she will stand up for it,\u201d the speaker, a Puerto Rico native, wrote.\n\nMs. Mark-Viverito also highlighted Ms. Clinton\u2019s support for programs like Obamacare, Medicare and Medicaid. But she also pointed out that several candidates in the Republican field, following the lead of real estate magnate Donald Trump, have indicated their opposition to providing some path to citizenship to the 11million illegal immigrants in the United States, and even suggested deporting them.\n\n\u201cThe Republican primary has been ugly. From top to bottom, the Republican field has made criminalization of Latinos and immigrants central to their campaigns,\u201d Ms. Mark-Viverito wrote. \u201cSimply put, the Republican primary has been a terrifying spectacle in madness. Come November 2016, the choice will be clear to Latinos. As President, Hillary will fight for Latino families and push for comprehensive immigration reforms we desperately need.\u201d\n\nNone of the proposals for either amnesty or deportation would impact Puerto Ricans, since they are American citizens.\n\nThe speaker\u2014whose East Harlem and South Bronx district is home to many Puerto Ricans\u2014ended on a feminist note.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s send a woman to the White House,\u201d she said.\n\nMs. Clinton has long been seen as the decisive and dominant front-runner for the Democratic nomination, but recent polls show her advantage over insurgent Sen. Bernie Sanders vanishing in the early voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire, which share the white rural demographics and political eccentricity of Mr. Sanders\u2019 home state of Vermont. Recent weeks have seen increasing rumors that Vice President Joseph Biden will enter the race.\n\nThe speaker is the third citywide official to back Ms. Clinton for president, with Public Advocate Letitia James and Comptroller Scott Stringer having announced her endorsement in April. Curiously, both Ms. James and Ms. Mark-Viverito are seen as even further to the left than Mayor Bill de Blasio, who has vowed to withhold his endorsement until the former First Lady unveils a plan for combating income inequality\u2014even though Mr. de Blasio worked in former President Bill Clinton\u2019s administration and once managed Ms. Clinton\u2019s campaign for Senate.\n\nDisclosure: Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, is publisher of Observer Media.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.byline_name": "Will Bredderman", "sailthru.author": "Will Bredderman", "application-name": "Observer", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/477205168.jpg?quality=80&w=640"}, "site": "@observer", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@Observer"}, "sailthru.article.image.header": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/477205168.jpg?quality=80&w=594&h=396&crop=1", "sailthru.tags": "Bill De Blasio, debt crisis, immigration reform, Letitia James, Melissa Mark-Viverito, Puerto Rico, obsNews & Politics, obsPolitics", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/477205168.jpg?quality=80&w=50", "keywords": "melissa mark-viverito, puerto rico, debt crisis, immigration reform, bill de blasio, letitia james,", "sailthru.article.image.grid": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/477205168.jpg?quality=80&w=300&h=225&crop=1", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://observer.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/dac0f3722a48a53be75eb06c0c4f5119?s=16", "description": "\"Let\u2019s send a woman to the White House,\" Melissa Mark-Viverito wrote in her endorsement of Hillary Clinton.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "msapplication-TileColor": "#2b5797", "sailthru.title": "New York City Council Speaker Ready for Hillary Clinton as President", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "sailthru.byline_slug": "will-bredderman", "sailthru.section": "News & Politics", "news_keywords": "Melissa Mark-Viverito, Puerto Rico, debt crisis, immigration reform, Bill de Blasio, Letitia James,", "sailthru.byline_avatar_url": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/also-me-e1411752505895.jpg?quality=80&w=129", "msapplication-tooltip": "News, Politics, Culture, Art, Style, Real Estate, Movie Reviews, TV recaps", "fb": {"app_id": 132947390197809}, "msapplication-TileImage": "//s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/newyorkobserver-2014/images/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "msvalidate.01": "F8C89E25D5233224541B1BB9B10BF573", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newyorkobserver", "published_time": "2015-09-02T13:18:05+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-02T16:27:47+00:00", "author": "http://observer.com/author/will-bredderman"}, "sailthru.description": "\"Let\u2019s send a woman to the White House,\" Melissa Mark-Viverito wrote in her endorsement of Hillary Clinton.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "og": {"site_name": "Observer", "description": "\u201cLet\u2019s send a woman to the White House,\u201d Melissa Mark-Viverito wrote in her endorsement of Hillary Clinton.", "title": "New York City Council Speaker Ready for Hillary Clinton as President", "url": "http://observer.com/2015/09/new-york-city-council-speaker-ready-for-hillary-clinton-as-president/", "image": {"width": 594, "identifier": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/477205168.jpg?quality=80", "height": 396}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "146b7f62998343012fae89709f3a8167"}, "sailthru.byline_bio": "Will Bredderman is a politics reporter at the Observer.
