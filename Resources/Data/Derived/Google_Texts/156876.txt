Pitts

COLTON >> Dr. Richard Pitts is in a listening mode.

This month, Pitts started as medical director of Arrowhead Regional Medical Center, replacing Dr. Dev Gnana Dev, who had been the county hospital’s top doc for 12 years.

Pitts was previously Orange County Service Area assistant medical director, based at Kaiser Permanente in Anaheim.

Pitts said he plans to focus on listening for the next three months, so he understands the hospital and its employees before he begins making changes — if changes are warranted.

“ARMC is an amazing place, especially in terms of educating the next generation of physicians as well as specialized services such as a burn center, trauma center and stroke center,” Pitts said. “Taken together, these programs and services will ensure that residents of our county have a vibrant and comprehensive medical center in their community.”

Pitts is certified by the American Board of Emergency Medicine and the American Board of Preventive Medicine.

As medical director, Pitts has a wide range of duties, including oversight of the delivery of medical services, implementation of policies and procedures, and he will provide a clinical perspective on matters related to medical services on the administrative team.

He also serves as a liaison between Arrowhead Regional and the 21 private physician corporations that hold contracts with the county hospital and will help guide the hospital through the challenges related to the full implementation of the Affordable Care Act.

With all those duties, Pitts said he still plans to see patients.

“I grew up in Massachusetts. Public service is just drilled into our heads there,” said Pitts. “I like seeing patients. That’s why I became a doctor.”

Pitts has been president and of the Orange County Medical Association, president of the Orange County Chapter of the American Heart Association and a volunteer physician for the American Red Cross.
