Elizabeth Warren and was featured in a glowing Rolling Stone profile. This week, he\u2019ll head to Washington to present a national liberal political agenda and then is on to California to give a pair of speeches.\n\nAnd so far in 2015, he\u2019s made as many trips to the Midwest \u2014 two \u2014 to lecture on income inequality as he has made official visits to the city\u2019s borough of Staten Island.\n\nIt is commonplace for New York City mayors to become national figures, but some experts believe that de Blasio \u2014 not even 18 months into his first term \u2014 is risking being perceived as someone who has forgotten about his home. A poll last week showed that fewer than half of New Yorkers believe the city is moving in the right direction.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s entering a path that can be dangerous for big-city mayors,\u201d said Kenneth Sherrill, a retired political science professor at Hunter College. \u201cIt\u2019s not unusual for a New York City mayor to be a national speaker for urban issues. But it is unusual for one to be so concerned about his national political party and its issues.\u201d\n\nDe Blasio \u2014 whose staff insisted that his focus is New York \u2014 made little mention of a national focus during his campaign, instead promising to give a voice to those who felt forgotten during a gilded decade when the gap between the rich and the poor widened.\n\nSince taking office, he\u2019s argued he can do that by impacting the national political conversation.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to change the politics of this country to be able to serve our people and the issue of income inequality is even deeper,\u201d de Blasio said last month. \u201cAnyone who represents everyday people needs to be a part of this effort.\u201d\n\nDe Blasio said that as he convened a gathering of national progressives at Gracie Mansion. They will meet again Tuesday in Washington where they will unveil a liberal platform that calls for the national adoption of some of de Blasio\u2019s work at home, including paid sick leave and free universal pre-kindergarten. The group has said it wants to move political candidates \u2014 including Hillary Rodham Clinton, whom de Blasio has yet to endorse \u2014 to the left on many issues, namely the fight against income inequality.\n\nDe Blasio has delivered that same message across the country in recent weeks as he takes steps to become one of the nation\u2019s loudest liberal voices. First came a trip to Nebraska and Iowa. Then, Wisconsin. And after his appearance at the U.S. Capitol, he\u2019ll fly to California to deliver two more lectures.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Does NYC mayor, now a national figure, risk trouble at home?", "title": "Does NYC mayor, now a national figure, risk trouble at home?", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Does NYC mayor, now a national figure, risk trouble at home?", "title": "Does NYC mayor, now a national figure, risk trouble at home?", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/10/does_nyc_mayor_now_a_national_figure_risk_trouble_at_home/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/nyc-mayor-what-about-new-york.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Does NYC mayor, now a national figure, risk trouble at home?", "title": "Does NYC mayor, now a national figure, risk trouble at home?", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/nyc-mayor-what-about-new-york.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Jonathan Lemire", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Since taking office, he\u2019s argued he can do that by impacting the national political conversation.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not unusual for a New York City mayor to be a national speaker for urban issues.\nThis week, he\u2019ll head to Washington to present a national liberal political agenda and then is on to California to give a pair of speeches.\nTopics: From the Wires, NewsNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s political vision \u2014 and his political travels \u2014 have increasingly reached far beyond the borders of New York City.\nA poll last week showed that fewer than half of New Yorkers believe the city is moving in the right direction."}
