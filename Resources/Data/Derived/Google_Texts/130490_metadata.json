Or drug-dealing? Or rape?\n\nSuch cases have been the stuff of novels, TV episodes and movies.\n\nBut in reality? It depends.\n\nWhat is known as diplomatic immunity was codified by the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, a pact to which some 190 countries subscribe. The treaty shields high-ranking diplomats and their families from prosecution.\n\nThe infractions are often on the minor end of the spectrum. A perennial frustration in New York (likely to flare up again with the United Nations General Assembly convened this month) is the millions of dollars in unpaid traffic citations.\n\nBut when a more serious crime occurs, and they do, the diplomat\u2019s country can give the accused up to local authorities for prosecution; otherwise, the host country can boot the suspect, declaring him or her \u201cpersona non grata.\u201d\n\nLast year, an Indian diplomat was arrested in New York on charges that stemmed from accusations of mistreating a domestic worker.\n\nIndia was outraged over the treatment of the diplomat, and, ultimately, she left the United States without being prosecuted, all under the cover of diplomatic immunity.\n\nRick Rojas contributed reporting.\n\nYour Morning Briefing is posted weekdays at 6 a.m. Eastern.\n\nWhat would you like to see here?
