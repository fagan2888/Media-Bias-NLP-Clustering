Earlier, Justice Shahzeb Saeed and Justice Syed Anjum Raza heard the case.\n\nThe hearing was held at the Kot Lakhpat Jail in Lahore. Both the accused who are also death row prisoners had allegedly attacked Sarabjit with sharp-edged weapons when he was being moved from one cell to another in the Kot Lakhpat Jail on April, 29, 2013.\n\nSarabjit, 49, later succumbed to his injuries at the Jinnah Hospital in Lahore on May 2.\n\nThe murder trial began in January, 2014, and subsequently the two alleged killers - Tamba and Muddassar Bashir - were indicted.\n\nBoth accused denied the murder charges when they were charge-sheeted.\n\nHowever, earlier they had confessed to the murder of the Indian death row prisoner before a one-member judicial commission constituted to probe the murder.\n\nThey said, \"We wanted to take revenge from him (Sarabjit) for killing Pakistanis in bomb blasts in Lahore and Faisalabad\".\n\nThe commission's report has also been submitted to the trial court.\n\nThe Human Rights Commission of Pakistan had labelled Sarabjit's murder as a \"planned one\".\n\nSarabjit was sentenced to death on spying charges and for killing at least 14 Pakistani citizens in bomb blasts in Punjab province in 1990.\n\nHis family however said that he was a victim of mistaken identity and had inadvertently strayed across the border. His mercy petitions were rejected by the courts and former President Pervez Musharraf.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "news", "og": {"site_name": "timesofindia-economictimes", "description": "LAHORE: A Pakistani court has dismissed the bail application of one of the alleged killers of Indian death row convict Sarabjit Singh who was murdered in a jail here in 2013.
