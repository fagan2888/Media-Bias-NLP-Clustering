Spencer Platt/Getty Images\n\nSUMMERVILLE, S.C. \u2013 Jeb Bush supporters think their presidential candidate has been thrown off his optimistic tone by the rancorous bullying of Donald Trump.\n\nAnd they're telling him that to his face.\n\nDuring a midday campaign stop at a country club here Wednesday, Bush was confronted at least three times by seemingly benevolent backers who critiqued his message and offered candid advice about how to right the course.\n\n\"I'm afraid that your message doesn't resonate to the national community,\" said Edward Scott, a Maryland resident who was traveling in the Palmetto State for work and supports Bush.\n\nThe complaints, delivered during a question-and-answer session on an outdoor patio overlooking a plush golf course, came in the wake of a GOP primary debate in which the former Florida governor responded aggressively to the front-running Trump, who accused his brother, former President George W. Bush, of knowingly lying about weapons of mass destruction in the lead-up to the war in Iraq.\n\n\n\nThree days before this state's GOP primary, Bush is attempting to salvage his White House candidacy with a surprise finish in second or third place. A poor showing \u2013 far behind Sens. Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio \u2013 likely would close the curtains on his 2016 hopes, and public polling has shown him lagging in fourth or fifth place.\n\nBush's supporters on Wednesday appeared to try to lend the candidate a hand, dispensing guidance in a telling revelation about the candidate's communication problems in the days before the primary vote.\n\nScott, who noted he believes Bush is best qualified to be president, asked him to resist responding to Trump's relentless broadsides.\n\n\"I was wondering, because of your civility, if you could raise the bar . . . and try to be beyond the bullying, because I think that's who you are and I think they try to knock you off center. It appears you do get knocked off center like anybody would because of the insults to you and your family,\" he said.\n\n\"I don't feel like I'm shaken up by the bullying,\" Bush responded indignantly, interrupting the man's soliloquy. \"I'm the only guy going after the guy because he's hijacking the party that I believe is the path to prosperity for more and more people. Donald Trump's not a conservative, and he's not a steady hand for sure, and he's not a servant. It's all about him. And I'm the only guy going after him. I don't feel like, that he's intimidating. He's a bully. Punch him back in the nose!\"\n\n\n\nJeb Bush supporters in Beaufort, S.C. Spencer Platt/Getty Images\n\nBush went on: \"Trump is an obstacle . . . but I will not take a step back for a guy that's like he is. Never.\"\n\nMoments later, another Bush backer \u2013 David Villinger of South Carolina \u2013 rose to echo Scott's gripes.\n\n\"I think the campaign's been co-opted by the P.T. Barnum of our time,\" Villinger said. \"I think he is getting you off your message, your good message \u2013 all these items you shared with us today. I would encourage you to emphasize those things more.\"\n\nFeeling beleaguered, Bush again interjected, saying, \"This is what I do, this is called campaigning right now.\"\n\nBut Villinger continued: \"No \u2013 I mean, sir, on the more national level, to the extent that you can.\"\n\nThe exchanges also illuminated the vexing situation in which Bush finds himself. After enduring months of charges that he's \"low-energy,\" Bush has noticeably added more pep and fire to his stump speeches. His debate performances have become more crisp and combative, and he's confronted Trump at most turns. And yet, even some of his most ardent fans now want him to tone it back down and retreat.\n\nThe guy can't win either way.\n\nBush said he's happy to talk about his policy vision \u2013 his alternative to the Affordable Care Act, his Western lands initiative, how he'd be the 10th Amendment president \u2013 and he often does devolve into wonky talk about the balanced budgets, triple-bond ratings and streams of vetoes he produced in Florida.\n\nBut he blames the media for making it all about Trump.\n\n\"All of these policy-oriented things don't resonate because the press is basically at the mercy of Donald Trump,\" Bush charged. \"And the more outlandish things he says \u2013 about my brother, knowing about 9-11 \u2013 you can't make this stuff up. This is Michael Moore talk. This is MoveOn.org talk. It generates all the news. Meanwhile back at the ranch, people are suffering.\"\n\n\n\nAnd Bush supporters seem increasingly resigned to the fate of their candidate.\n\nAnn Bragg of Johns Island, South Carolina, proudly affixed a red \"Jeb!\" sticker to her blouse and expressed her great admiration of the Bush family and Jeb's executive experience.\n\nBut when asked how she thought he'd fare Saturday, she visibly cringed, biting her lip.\n\n\"Don't know. I hope so. I think it's gonna be tough,\" she says.\n\nThe first questioner Bush called on during this stop was a retired military veteran who retold a story about how last March, Bush sat around a table at the Charleston, South Carolina, airport for hours, listening to residents' troubling experiences with health care provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n\n\"It's something you don't talk about,\" the man recalled, \"but I think you should.\"\n\nBush responded for several minutes, detailing his veterans policy and at one point asking, \"Who in this room thinks it's appropriate for a veteran to be homeless?\"\n\nWhen no hands went up, Bush couldn't resist the opportunity to poke fun at the surreal campaign cycle he's experiencing.\n\n\"Given the contest I'm in, there could be someone who raises their hand,\" he said to laughs.\n\nAfterward, Scott wasn't sure if Bush got his message. The next time Trump takes a whack at him, he wants Bush to \"turn the other cheek \u2013 a dozen times if he has to.\"\n\n\n\nAs far as political strategy goes, that would seem like malpractice. But Scott was convinced Bush was hurting himself by toiling in the mud with Trump.\n\n\"It's really working for him now, isn't it?\" he asked sarcastically. \"It's like watching 'The Jerry Springer Show.'\"\n\nSpeaking to a horde of reporters afterward, Villinger agreed with Scott: \"I'm seeing him trying to be the anti-Trump, but he's doing it in a Trumpful way. He's off his issues,\" he said.\n\nUnsatisfied by Bush's explanation, Villinger, once a dedicated supporter, now counted himself as open to someone else.\n\nFor his part, Bush told his audience to ignore the plethora of pundits who have already called the race. He asked his supporters to motivate 10 others to trek to the polls Saturday, and pleaded with those still deciding that he's their guy.\n\nBut his most memorable line was for his detractors, some of whom could've been mistaken for his supporters at this event.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "The Run 2016 [News]", "title": "Jeb Bush\u2019s Supporters Are Singing the Blues", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Bush\u2019s backers in South Carolina complain Donald Trump has dragged him into the mud.", "title": "Supporters to Jeb: The Donald's in Your Head", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/run-2016/2016/02/17/jeb-bushs-supporters-are-singing-the-blues", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/cf/28/169f1a7642d0b90279e9e6c4686c/160217-jeb-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@USNews", "description": "Bush\u2019s backers in South Carolina complain Donald Trump has dragged him into the mud.", "card": "summary", "title": "Jeb Bush\u2019s Supporters Are Singing the Blues"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "news", "date_published": "Feb. 17, 2016", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "David Catanese,Pulse,Bush, Jeb,2016 presidential election,campaigns,picks,South Carolina,The Run 2016 [News]", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Bush\u2019s backers in South Carolina complain Donald Trump has dragged him into the mud."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdec42\"", "article_summary": "Spencer Platt/Getty ImagesSUMMERVILLE, S.C. \u2013 Jeb Bush supporters think their presidential candidate has been thrown off his optimistic tone by the rancorous bullying of Donald Trump.\nJeb Bush supporters in Beaufort, S.C.
