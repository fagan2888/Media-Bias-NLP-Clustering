Bob Menendez (D., N.J.) pulled from the foreign relations committee\u2019s agenda Monday evening a major piece of pro-Israel legislation known as the U.S.-Israel Strategic Partnership Act, which would have bolstered defense and intelligence ties between the two nations.\n\nMenendez called off the vote in order to prevent Sen. Bob Corker (R., Tenn.) from introducing an amendment that would grant Congress a final say on any deal the Obama administration strikes with Iran regarding its contested nuclear program, according to congressional aides.\n\nSixty-nine percent of likely voters support congressional oversight on a nuclear deal, according to a poll released by the Israel Project.\n\nCorker\u2019s measure is opposed by the White House, which seeks to bypass Congress in order to push through a controversial deal with Iran that would fully lift economic sanctions in exchange for nuclear concessions.\n\nCorker\u2019s Iran oversight measure would have put Senate Democrats in a tricky political position, forcing them to choose between the White House and the pro-Israel community just months before critical mid-term elections.\n\nSenior officials in the pro-Israel community warned that Menendez\u2019s efforts to insulate his fellow Democrats from taking a politically inconvenient vote will be remembered come November.\n\n\u201cHow many more times is this president going to force Senate Democrats to walk the plank for his failed policies?\u201d asked one official with a Washington, D.C.-based pro-Israel group who requested anonymity.\n\n\u201cThey already have to defend Obamacare on domestic policy. They already have to defend Benghazi. And now he\u2019s asking them to run interference on appeasing Iran,\u201d said the official. \u201cHow many seats do the Democrats have to lose before the president stops punishing them for his terrible judgment?\u201d\n\nThe U.S.-Israel Strategic Partnership Act has been a major legislative item for the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), the nation\u2019s leading pro-Israel group, which has top members in town this week lobbying congressional offices on the bill.\n\nWhile AIPAC told the Washington Free Beacon yesterday that it supports Corker\u2019s measure. The group declined multiple times to comment on Menendez\u2019s move to pull the entire piece of legislation.\n\nIt is unclear what the group\u2019s strategy will be now that its key legislative item has been put on ice.\n\n\u201cIf the [Corker] amendment were offered, AIPAC would certainly not oppose it and has told other members in leadership in the [Senate Foreign Relations Committee] that it would support the amendment if offered,\u201d one insider familiar with AIPAC\u2019s position told the Free Beacon on Monday, hours before Menendez officially pulled the bill.\n\nAs Menendez fights to keep the Corker measure from coming to a vote, he and Sen. Mark Kirk\u2019s (R., Ill.) stalled bill to level greater sanctions on Iran continues to garner Senate support.\n\nThe bill\u2014which fell apart after the White House launched a massive bid to kill the legislation\u2014attracted 60 co-sponsors, a key threshold of support, when Sen. John Walsh (D., Mont.) signed on in late April.\n\nSenate insiders said the ongoing Democratic support for a bill that is effectively dead sends a strong signal that there is growing unease over the Obama administration\u2019s strategy on Iran.\n\nSen. Mike Lee (R., Utah), a former member of the foreign relations committee, expressed shock that Menendez would pull the entire pro-Israel bill in order to prevent a tough vote on Corker\u2019s measure.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s indicative of the way this place is running right now under Democratic leadership,\u201d Lee told the Free Beacon on Tuesday. \u201cThe senate has become an amendment free zone. It\u2019s a dangerous and troubling trend.\u201d\n\nLee, who said he supports Corker\u2019s amendment, maintained that the Obama administration should not be permitted to skirt Congress as it did when the interim nuclear agreement was signed last year.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t just accept this answer forever, that, \u2018We\u2019re working on this and its going to be awesome so trust us,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cAt some point we need to see text.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "The fallout from a rushed, late night decision by a leading Democrat to scuttle key pro-Israel legislation in a bid to appease the Obama administration threatens to complicate efforts by Democrats to", "title": "Dems Kill Key Pro-Israel bill to Appease White House on Iran", "url": "http://freebeacon.com/national-security/dems-kill-key-pro-israel-bill-to-appease-white-house-on-iran/", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Bob-Menendez-AP5-150x150.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The fallout from a rushed, late night decision by a leading Democrat to scuttle key pro-Israel legis", "title": "Dems Kill Key Pro-Israel bill to Appease White House on Iran", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Bob-Menendez-AP5-150x150.jpg", "creator": "@Kredo0", "site": "@freebeacon", "card": "summary"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1047859882", "fb": {"app_id": "FB_APP_ID"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd894d\"", "article_summary": "Corker\u2019s Iran oversight measure would have put Senate Democrats in a tricky political position, forcing them to choose between the White House and the pro-Israel community just months before critical mid-term elections.\nThe bill\u2014which fell apart after the White House launched a massive bid to kill the legislation\u2014attracted 60 co-sponsors, a key threshold of support, when Sen.
