It's safe to say that Hermantown is in hockey heaven.

After six consecutive losses in the state tournament, the Hawks finally captured the Boys Class A championship Saturday at the Xcel Energy Center.

The hometown welcome the team got upon their return to the community that's cheered through the highs and lows, might have even rivaled the more than 8,000 fans at the "X."

Several hundred gathered Sunday night at the Hermantown High School gymnasium for the rally.

Hermantown's next generation of players to hit the ice with Hawk's jersey formed a tunnel around a red carpet and held hockey sticks high as the high school team came into the gym. Players donned jerseys of their own and first place medals as they doled out high fives.

The mayor, school superintendent and youth hockey representatives were among those to congratulate the team and the community on a season for the books in the half-hour program.
