He made headlines in 2008 with the announcement of the Judge Paul Pressler School of Law, which never opened, and in 2012, when he said he would shut the college down before providing abortion-inducing drugs mandated by Obamacare.\n\nIn 2013 Aguillard stepped into an ongoing debate in the Southern Baptist Convention between free will and predestination when his administration declined to renew the contracts of three Calvinist professors, who believed that God, and not human agency, is sovereign in determining whether or not an individual is saved. Critics said the conflict was staged to draw attention away from bigger problems at Louisiana College.\n\nTwo vice presidents filed a 13-page whistleblower complaint accusing the president of misappropriating funds and intentionally deceiving administrators and trustees. One of the two later filed a lawsuit for wrongful termination, claiming his contract was not renewed in retaliation for the whistleblower complaint.\n\nDocuments leaked online alleged extortion, cover up of a sex scandal, forgery and mishandling of a $5 million donation to the Caskey School of Divinity, all on Aguillard\u2019s watch.\n\nThrough it all, a majority of the board of trustees stood by the embattled president. Trustees voted to retain him as president in a specially called meeting in April 2013, praying for him with a laying on of hands.\n\nAguillard chose to step down as president in April 2014. Two weeks later the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools placed Louisiana College on probation because of issues related to trustee board governance, institutional integrity, personnel policies and audit findings regarding student financial aid and other financial control matters.\n\nTerms of Aguillard\u2019s departure included a one-year paid sabbatical at his full $202,007 base salary, after which he would return to the classroom as a tenured senior professor earning $101,003.50 his first year and $60,602.10 for all subsequent years he works at the college.\n\nThen-trustee chairman Tommy French released a statement crediting Aguillard for serving the college \u201cwith diligence, fortitude and Christian commitment\u201d and announcing that trustees \u201cvoted to bestow upon Dr. Aguillard the honor of continuing his contributions to Louisiana College in the role of president emeritus.\u201d\n\nFrench formally conveyed the president emeritus title on Aguillard with a medal and certificate of distinguished service at the first chapel service in the fall of 2014.\n\nArgile Smith, associate dean of the Louisiana College Caskey School of Divinity, followed Aguillard as interim president until the election of longtime Charleston Southern University administrator Rick Brewer as the ninth president of Louisiana College in March 2015.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Baptist News Global", "description": "A Baptist college in Louisiana is seeking to remove its controversial former president from a teaching position on the faculty, according to a local media report.\r\n\r\n[caption id=", "title": "Former president, now professor, reportedly on way out at Louisiana College", "url": "https://baptistnews.com/2016/03/21/former-president-now-professor-reportedly-on-way-out-at-louisiana-college/", "image": "https://1648o73kablq2rveyn64glm1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Aguillard-Joe-300x200.jpg", "type": "article"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "BNG", "robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Critics said the conflict was staged to draw attention away from bigger problems at Louisiana College.\nA Baptist college in Louisiana is seeking to remove its controversial former president from a teaching position on the faculty, according to a local media report.\nAguillard\u2019s election as president in 2005 was controversial because it occurred as the Louisiana Baptist Convention\u2019s leadership was shifting from moderate to conservative control.\nArgile Smith, associate dean of the Louisiana College Caskey School of Divinity, followed Aguillard as interim president until the election of longtime Charleston Southern University administrator Rick Brewer as the ninth president of Louisiana College in March 2015.\nTwo vice presidents filed a 13-page whistleblower complaint accusing the president of misappropriating funds and intentionally deceiving administrators and trustees."}
