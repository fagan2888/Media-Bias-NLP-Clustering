It\u2019d be newsworthy if any of them actually ever succeeded.\n\nBut it\u2019s worth pausing for an autopsy and retrospective on Xunlight, because it\u2019s a great (or terrible, depending on how you look at it) example of how government at all levels\u2014state and federal\u2014and in both parties\u2014Republican and Democrat \u2014wastes taxpayer money by subsidizing politically connected businesses.\n\nThe stereotype is of the Washington, D.C. Democrats shoveling stimulus money into solar energy firms. And indeed there were plenty of Democrats involved with Xunlight.\n\nAccording to the Toledo Blade, one of the few press outlets following the story, \u201cIn 2010, the company received $34.5 million in tax credits as part of the stimulus bill. U.S. Rep. Marcy Kaptur (D., Toledo) helped secure nearly $3 million in federal earmarks for the company. The company received a $3 million grant from the National Institute of Standards and Technology, a more than $4 million loan from the state, and more than $2 million in state and local tax credits.\u201d\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t only Democrats who wanted to use the power and dollars of government to give Xunlight a boost. Senator Portman of Ohio, the perennial vice-presidential hopeful who was director of the Office of Management and Budget in George W. Bush\u2019s administration, issued a press release touting legislation that he said would \u201cwould boost Toledo\u2019s growing leadership in green industries and initiatives. The opportunities that could emerge would complement the efforts of existing companies in the region\u2019s rapidly maturing solar industry. These include Xunlight Corp., whose innovative solar panel technologies are powering the first totally solar-powered billboard in New York\u2019s Times Square.\u201d\n\nAnd in the closing days of the 2008 presidential race, the McCain campaign sent its vice presidential candidate, Governor Palin of Alaska, to speak in Toledo at Xunlight headquarters. \u201cI appreciate the hospitality of Xunlight Energy, and all the people of Toledo. The folks at Xunlight are doing great work for this community and our country,\u201d Palin said on October 29, 2008. \u201cEvery day, when there are no cameras around to draw attention to it, this company and others like it are engaged in the great enterprise of energy independence. And what we see here is just a glimpse of much bigger things to come. Solar power is one of many alternative energy sources that are changing our economy for the better. And one day they will change our economy forever.\u201d\n\nThe Economist magazine wrote a dispatch about Xunlight and its 100 employees under the headline \u201cGreening the Rustbelt:\u201d \u201cGreen investment presents new hope,\u201d the magazine declared.\n\nFederal Election Commission records show the company\u2019s founder, Xunming Deng, donated $3,000 to the campaigns of Marcy Kaptur, a Democratic congresswoman from Ohio. In 2010, he gave $4,500 to the campaign of Ohio\u2019s governor, Ted Strickland, a Democrat, Ohio state campaign finance records show.\n\nU.S. Senate lobbying records show Xunlight spent $100,000 total in 2008 and 2009 to hire lobbyists at the PMA Group, which closed in 2009 after being raided by federal prosecutors.\n\nMaybe someone, someday will yet figure out how to make a successful business out of Xunlight\u2019s solar technology, or out of some other solar technology. If they do, though, I hope it will be on the basis of having good technology, not on having pull in Washington or in some state capital.\n\nThe Xunlights of the world raise issues of both justice and efficiency.\n\nJustice, because how is it just for individuals laboring in unsubsidized industries, or in heavily taxed ones, to have their earnings taxed and transferred to the Xunlights of the world?\n\nAnd efficiency, because what evidence is there that government or politicians are better than venture capitalists or other market-based investors in selecting companies to invest in? The incentives are all off: by the time the subsidized businesses go belly-up, many of the politicians are out of office, and the press has moved on to other things, so few voters even notice.\n\nThe whole process could benefit from some sunlight. Not Xunlight, but sunlight of the old-fashioned, standard-spelling variety.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://reason.com/archives/2014/12/01/government-backed-green-energy-goes-bust", "site_name": "Reason.com", "type": "article", "description": "What the Xunlight solar energy firm bankruptcy reveals about crony capitalism.", "title": "Government-Backed Green Energy Goes Bust"}, "twitter": {"site": "@reason", "description": "The recent Chapter 7 bankruptcy and liquidation filing of the\nToledo, Ohio-based solar-panel manufacturer Xunlight Corp. has\nattracted barely any national attention.\nMaybe it\u2019s gotten to the point\u2014after Solyndra, Evergreen,\nAbound, and Satcon\u2014that the failure of another government-backed\nalternative energy company is a dog-bites man story.
