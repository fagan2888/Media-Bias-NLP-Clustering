By coincidence, Charles Cooke has a piece out today on the alternate universe you too can inhabit if only you Lean Forward far enough:\n\nAmerica II, as anyone who watches the channel will discover rather swiftly, hosts a supermajority of well-meaning multi-culti, progressive types whose foolproof plans for explosive economic growth, uniform social justice, and general human utopia are constantly being undone by a blossoming white-supremacist movement, split apart by neo-secessionists, and existentially threatened by traitors whose defining characteristic is a never-quite-explained hatred for progress. America II features no gray areas whatsoever: All local variation is apartheid, each and every identification requirement is the second coming of Jim Crow, all criticism of the government is sedition. It\u2019s exhausting.\n\nOn a network where smirking references to \u201cteabaggers\u201d are treated as witty, Harris-Perry\u2019s attempt to rehabilitate \u201cObamaCare\u201d as some sort of slur practically qualifies as clever. How to square the fact that O himself now uses the term with the quasi-religious belief that any Republican messaging about him, no matter how innocuous and easily explained by basic partisanship, must be proof of racism in America II? Simple: Claim that \u201cObamaCare\u201d was a slur, but now, by embracing the word himself, Obama\u2019s taken the power back. If you find that unpersuasive, remember, decoding conservative criticism of O for alleged racial subtexts is a sort of parlor game on MSNBC. Previously identified dog-whistles include \u201cIRS,\u201d \u201cChicago,\u201d and my favorite, \u201cgolf.\u201d Usually the game ends with some variation of \u201cand that\u2019s why it\u2019s racist,\u201d but MHP\u2019s argument has a whole second part to it. Consider this bar raised.\n\nLegal Insurrection has a nice post tracking the origins of the word \u201cObamaCare,\u201d including a claim from none other than Anthony Weiner that he coined the term himself. Which, if true, partially vindicates Harris-Perry: A wealthy white man really is responsible. By the way, as I write this, there are roughly 575,000 results for \u201cRomneyCare\u201d on Google. On this site alone, that word appears in more than 250 posts.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "\u201cA word that was originally intended as a derogatory term, meant to shame and divide and demean.\u201d", "title": "MSNBC: Let\u2019s face it, \u201cObamaCare\u201d was a word coined by wealthy white men to diminish Obama\u2019s accomplishments", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2013/12/09/msnbc-lets-face-it-obamacare-was-a-word-coined-by-wealthy-white-men-to-diminish-obamas-accomplishments/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "keywords": "harris-perry, hillary, hillarycare, n-word, Obama, ObamaCare, romney, Romneycare, slur, wealthy, white men,", "article": {"published_time": "2013-12-09T16:21:30+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-12-09T17:07:19+00:00"}, "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd84c\"", "article_summary": "MSNBC: Let\u2019s face it, \u201cObamaCare\u201d was a word coined by wealthy white men to diminish Obama\u2019s accomplishmentsposted at 11:21 am on December 9, 2013 by AllahpunditVia RCP.\nWhich, if true, partially vindicates Harris-Perry: A wealthy white man really is responsible.\nLegal Insurrection has a nice post tracking the origins of the word \u201cObamaCare,\u201d including a claim from none other than Anthony Weiner that he coined the term himself.\nSimple: Claim that \u201cObamaCare\u201d was a slur, but now, by embracing the word himself, Obama\u2019s taken the power back.\nOn a network where smirking references to \u201cteabaggers\u201d are treated as witty, Harris-Perry\u2019s attempt to rehabilitate \u201cObamaCare\u201d as some sort of slur practically qualifies as clever."}
