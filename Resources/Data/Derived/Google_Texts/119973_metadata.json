Ted Cruz asserted that Republican leaders choked off his supply of campaign money 18 months ago as punishment for his role in the 16-day government shutdown.\n\nHe\u2019s bounced back.\n\nIn his first eight days as a presidential candidate, Cruz raked in $4 million, mostly from low-dollar donors eager to propel his tea party-friendly bid. And it turned out that was a mere pittance compared with the $31 million rounded up last week by a small \u2014 and still shadowy \u2014 set of wealthy benefactors for a new quartet of pro-Cruz political committees known as super PACs.\n\nCruz can\u2019t use that money to hire his own staff in Iowa or air his own ads in South Carolina. Direct coordination isn\u2019t allowed. But these benefactors, most of whom won\u2019t be identified before July, can stretch whatever direct donations Cruz pulls in by serving up polls, ads, opposition research and more.\n\nSo, sorry, Rick Perry and Rand Paul. This is no shoestring insurgency fueled solely by grassroots, Gadsden flag-waving fans. Cruz may never keep pace with Jeb Bush, who can tap the ultimate network of GOP money men. But despite the GOP establishment\u2019s disdain, Cruz will have plenty of money to remain viable well into the early contests of 2016.\n\nThat\u2019s a far cry from the woe-is-me message Cruz was putting out just two weeks ago.\n\nDays after he launched his campaign, Cruz underscored his role as a Washington outsider by telling a crowd in New Hampshire that Senate GOP leaders had punished him after the October 2013 shutdown by pressuring donors to cut him off.\n\n\u201cIn 2013, we got quite a bit of money from D.C. PACs,\u201d he said, and when the fight over Obamacare led to the shutdown, \u201cthat dropped to almost zero. It was leadership.\u201d\n\nHe declined to point fingers at anyone in particular \u2014 not his fellow Texan, deputy GOP leader John Cornyn, nor Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell, now the majority leader. But Cruz insisted that he and his wingman in the shutdown fight, Utah Sen. Mike Lee, felt the sting.\n\n\u201cWe had multiple reports from the D.C. community that they had been told in no uncertain terms, do not write a check to these guys. It\u2019s how leadership disciplines people,\u201d Cruz asserted.\n\nThe friction between Cruz and GOP leadership is mutual and well-known. The shutdown was a low point. Cruz prodded House conservatives to force the showdown in a bid to remove funding for the health care law. GOP leaders in the House and Senate viewed the strategy as counterproductive, futile and dangerous. So did most GOP senators and many others.\n\n\u201cYou have to appreciate the irony that someone who routinely trashes the \u2018D.C. establishment\u2019 is now complaining that they\u2019re not giving him enough money,\u201d said GOP strategist Brian Walsh, communications director for several years at the Republican Senate campaign group. \u201cThe reality is that when you play Russian roulette with the economy by blocking the government from paying its bills, you shouldn\u2019t be surprised when the business community in this country stops taking you seriously.\u201d\n\nIn fall 2013, Cruz\u2019s next Senate race was five years away. So it\u2019s unclear how much pain he would really endure if PAC donations dried up. In any case, it\u2019s hard to spot a dramatic drop-off in his campaign and political action committees disclosure reports.\n\nCruz has raised an anemic $51,000 from D.C.-area PACs since the shutdown. But he was never much of a PAC powerhouse. In the six months before the shutdown, he collected just $101,500 from such groups, and whatever he lost, he easily made up through appeals linked to his Green Eggs and Ham 21-hour anti-Obamacare talkathon on the Senate floor.\n\nWell over $220,000 poured in the week after that.\n\nThe business community, and its PACs, were less excited about the brinkmanship, no prodding required from McConnell.\n\nThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce gave Cruz a 63 percent rating for 2013, based in part on his vote against the deal that ended the shutdown. The Chamber sets 70 percent as a minimum to earn its support.\n\n\u201cWe expressed our dissatisfaction with the shutdown, and made it clear why we thought that was a very bad strategy,\u201d said spokeswoman Blair Latoff.\n\nLee doesn\u2019t back up Cruz\u2019s contention that party leaders tried to dry up his funds.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not aware of any conspiracy to shut us out of anything,\u201d he told reporters Friday.\n\nBut for Cruz, this is all a badge of honor. He can proclaim himself the Washington outsider. And laugh all the way to the bank.\n\nFollow Washington Bureau Chief Todd J.
