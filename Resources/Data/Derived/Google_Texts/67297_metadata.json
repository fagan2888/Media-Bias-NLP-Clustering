Conversely, \u201cthe Indiana Amish [are] among the least allergic populations ever described in the developed world,\u201d science writer Moises Velasquez-Manoff, wrote in a recent opinion article in The New York Times.\n\nWhile genetics is undoubtedly behind this discrepancy, it doesn\u2019t explain the whole mystery. According to Mark Holbreich, an allergist who works in Indianapolis, a clear majority of the Amish children he tested have had extensive exposure to a rural setting. He suspects that contact with farming must somehow make their immune systems more resilient, a phenomenon known as the \u201cfarm effect.\u201d\n\nThe idea is that a rural setting introduces children to microbes, mold, plant material and raw milk, which challenge their immune system early on in life, making it alert and ready for whatever invaders they run into later on.\n\nManoff noted that a boost in allergic disease is now happening in quickly developing countries too \u2014 regions that rarely had them before. A case in point is China where a 2009 study found significantly lower rates of allergic sensitization and asthma rates among schoolchildren in rural areas outside of Beijing compared to those who lived in the city.\n\nAnother sign that our modernized surroundings diminish the resilience of our immune systems is the fact that immigrants who move from a developing part of the world are altogether less allergic but become more allergic the longer they live in a developed country.\n\nStudies have discounted differences in exposure to urban pollution as well as levels of physical activity as factors that explain this immunological deviation. In fact, strengthening of the immune system is likely happening before birth when pregnant mothers are exposed to these not-so-sterile rural environments.\n\nOne study found that the likelihood of a child developing eczema lessens as the amount of microbes found in the mother\u2019s mattress increases. Children have also been found to develop allergic disease much less frequently when they are born to mothers who worked with livestock when pregnant.\n\nThe immunological cell that might steer this trend is a type of white blood cell, regulatory T-cells, which keeps the immune system in line and not over-reactive. One Munich University study discovered that babies of farmers have more regulatory T-cells in their umbilical cord blood than those born to nonfarmers.\n\n\u201c[T]hat suppressive ability increases with the number of different types of animals the mother tended while pregnant,\u201d Manoff wrote. \u201cThe more cows, pigs, and chickens a mother encounters, essentially, the more easily her offspring may tolerate dust mites and tree pollens.\u201d\n\nThe good news is that our immune systems can be responsive to the farm effect until as late as young adulthood, according to a Danish study. But Manoff warns city folk that occasional, brief visits to your uncle\u2019s farm might actually have the opposite effect and exacerbate allergic responses. Apparently, the farm effect requires the young to settle into country living for a while.\n\nAltogether, farmers' well-trained immune systems probably resemble what everybody's immune system was like as it evolved in a microbial-rich hunter-gatherer setting. What this means, scientists say, is that our immune systems have become wimpier thanks to the cleaner, modern luxuries that have pampered us since the Industrial Revolution.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "rural, city, allergies, farmers, farm effect, allergens", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The microbial challenges a farm setting provides could help farmers stave off allergies, thereby providing clues for treatment.", "title": "How Does Modernization Explain The Current Allergy Epidemic?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/how-does-modernization-explain-current-allergy-epidemic-unaffected-farmers-reveal-possible-treatment", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/11/11/shutterstock-photo-pregnant-women-wheat-field.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The microbial challenges a farm setting provides could help farmers stave off allergies, thereby providing clues for treatment.", "title": "How Does Modernization Explain The Current Allergy Epidemic?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/how-does-modernization-explain-current-allergy-epidemic-unaffected-farmers-reveal-possible-treatment", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/11/11/shutterstock-photo-pregnant-women-wheat-field.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/11/11/shutterstock-photo-pregnant-women-wheat-field.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Conditions", "published_time": "2013-11-11T18:10:28-05:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-11T18:10:27-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The microbial challenges a farm setting provides could help farmers stave off allergies, thereby providing clues for treatment."}, "article_summary": "The microbial challenges a farm setting provides could help farmers stave off allergies, thereby providing clues for treatment.\nAltogether, farmers' well-trained immune systems probably resemble what everybody's immune system was like as it evolved in a microbial-rich hunter-gatherer setting.\nManoff noted that a boost in allergic disease is now happening in quickly developing countries too \u2014 regions that rarely had them before.\nWhat this means, scientists say, is that our immune systems have become wimpier thanks to the cleaner, modern luxuries that have pampered us since the Industrial Revolution.\nThe immunological cell that might steer this trend is a type of white blood cell, regulatory T-cells, which keeps the immune system in line and not over-reactive."}
