He noted the difficulty of screening for self-radicalized individuals in the U.S.\n\n\u201cThis is a different kind of challenge than the sort that we had with an organization like al-Qaeda that involved highly trained operatives who are working as cells or as a network,\u201d Obama said.\n\nThe president reiterated his belief the United States will defeat the Islamic State, which it has been bombing for more than 18 months in Iraq and Syria. He also vowed to follow through on one of his first campaign promises: Shutting down Guantanamo Bay, the facility in Cuba that holds detainees captured in the war on terrorism. Obama called the prison camp \u201cone of the key magnets for jihadi\u201d recruiters seeking to \u201ccreate this mythology that America is at war with Islam.\u201d\n\nObama dodged a question about whether he believes the presidency of Syria\u2019s Bashar al-Assad will outlast his own, saying, \u201cI think that Assad is going to have to leave the country to stop the bloodletting or for all the parties involved to be able to move forward in a nonsectarian way.\u201d\n\nObama called the government funding bill passed by Congress Friday morning \u201ca good win.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are some things in there that I don\u2019t like, but that's the nature of legislation and compromise,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the system worked. That gives me some optimism that next year on a narrow set of issues we can get some more.\u201d\n\nObama said he is \u201chopeful\u201d about sentencing reform making its way through Congress next year. Before the news conference, he commuted the sentences of 95 drug offenders, the third time this year he has used his clemency power to release individuals who received sentences now considered harsh for drug crimes.\n\nAfter his visit to San Bernardino Friday night, Obama and the rest of the first family head to Hawaii for their annual two-week vacation.\n\n\u201cI have to get to Star Wars,\u201d he said as he left the briefing room, waving.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The president spoke to reporters at the White House Friday before leaving for San Bernardino and Hawaii.", "author": "Marina Koren", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "The president spoke to reporters at the White House Friday before leaving for San Bernardino and Hawaii.", "title": "What Obama Said in His Final Press Conference of the Year", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2015/12/RTX1ZB5D/facebook.jpg?1450472597", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/12/obama-press-conference/421236/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI have never been more optimistic about a year ahead than I am right now,\u201d Obama said.\n\u201cClearly, this is not the most important thing that\u2019s taking place in the White House today,\u201d the president said.\nAfter his visit to San Bernardino Friday night, Obama and the rest of the first family head to Hawaii for their annual two-week vacation.\n\u201cI have to get to Star Wars,\u201d he said as he left the briefing room, waving.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a screening of Star Wars.\u201d\"You told the nation there\u2019s no specific or credible threat of a similar attack, but how is it really possible to know?\u201d one reporter asked Obama."}
