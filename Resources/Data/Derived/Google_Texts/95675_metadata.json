So instead of a thoughtful conversation about climate change, or last week\u2019s vote in Congress to repeal the Affordable Care Act, or even guns and violence, we turn on the television and terrorism dominates our discourse. This is where the narrative of fear trumps the data.Yes, terrorism is a problem. And It\u2019s frightening. But it\u2019s hardly the most important (or deadly) one that this nation faces. Vox World (before the San Bernardino massacre ) pointed out: \u201cMore than 10,000 Americans are killed every year by gun violence. By contrast, so few Americans have been killed by terrorist attacks since 9/11 that when you chart the two together, the terrorism death count approximates zero for every year except 2001. This comparison, if anything, understates the gap: Far more Americans die every year from (easily preventable ) gun suicides than gun homicides.\u201dThat is certainly true in Indian country. A recent study by the University of North Dakota found that firearms are used 41 percent of the time in suicides, a significantly higher rate than other ethnic groups.What\u2019s terrorism and what\u2019s routine gun violence? This country averages a mass murder every day. Yet every proposal to do something from the president has been ignored or condemned by the Congress. On Sunday the president said it\u2019s too easy for \u201cpeople who want to harm Americans to buy guns.\u201dBut that\u2019s not a message Congress will hear. Right now, even funding studies about gun violence is seen as biased and anti-gun. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have been blocked from research for more than two decades. \u201cThe amount of money available today for studying the impact of firearms is a fraction of what it was in the mid-1990s, and the number of scientists toiling in the field has dwindled to just a handful as a result,\u201d The New York Times said . \u201cNo other field of inquiry is singled out in this way.\u201dInstead Congress is eager to spend billions of dollars on military operations that don\u2019t solve terrorism and, in the case of Daesh , the war effort clearly fueled the group\u2019s rise to power.Last week that same political divide surfaced again in the Senate when it voted against an amendment to prevent people on the terrorist \u201cno fly\u201d list from purchasing a weapon. Republicans argued that preventing people from buying guns would violate their Second Amendment rights. This is not just an academic debate. The Government Accountability Office found that \u201cfrom February 2004 through February 2009, a total o www.nraila.org/articles/20151203/senate-holds-the-line-on-second-amendment-rights f 963 NICS background checks resulted in valid matches with individuals on the terrorist watch list. Of these transactions, approximately 90 percent (865 of 963) were allowed to proceed because the checks revealed no prohibiting information, such as felony convictions, illegal immigrant status, or other disqualifying factors. Two of the 865 transactions that were allowed to proceed involved explosives background checks.\u201d And how many of those sales were stopped? GAO said: \u201cAbout 10 percent (98 of 963) of the transactions were denied based on the existence of prohibiting information. No transactions involving explosives background checks were denied.\u201d Not that that \u201cNo Fly\u201d list is perfect (but that\u2019s another story).Guns? Check. Explosives? Fine. Your Second Amendment rights are protected as defined by the National Rifle Association. The NRA\u2019s version of the Senate vote was \u201cSenate holds the line on Second Amendment rights.\u201d John Oceguera, a candidate for Congress in Nevada, made national headlines this week by renouncing his membership in the National Rifle Association. \u201cI am a law-abiding gun owner, and have been a Life Member of the National Rifle Association (NRA). I grew up in a family of hunters,\u201d Oceguera wrote in a letter to the NRA. \u201cBut more importantly, I\u2019m a father and a husband. I believe that keeping our families safe is our most fundamental priority.\u201dOceguera is a member of the Walker River Paiute Tribe . He said the country can no longer ignore gun violence. \u201cStill, the NRA opposes any legislation that would help keep guns out of the hands of terrorists, criminals and the mentally ill, and spends millions to stop any action in Congress that could help prevent further violence. I cannot continue to be a member while the NRA refuses to back closing these loopholes. Therefore, I resign my membership in the NRA, effective immediately.Across the country, Native American congressional candidates are split on the gun issue along party lines. In Arizona, Democrat Victoria Steele said: \u201cThe issue of gun violence in Arizona and around the country has reached epidemic proportions. Stories of mass shootings and casualties by the dozens are on the brink of becoming commonplace. And yet, despite that alarming trend, Congress does nothing.\u201dMeanwhile, in Montana, Denise Juneau, who\u2019s the state superintendent of public instruction, dismissed an initiative that would permit public school employees to be armed. She told Montana Public Radio that she\u2019s against the proposal \u2026 \u201cbecause schools are supposed to be safe places for learning, adding guns into that mix threatens that. It just has so much opportunity for crisis to happen that it\u2019s just a bad idea.\u201dHowever, Tom Cole, R-Oklahoma, called the measure to prohibit people on the terrorist watch list from purchasing guns \u201ca paper tiger.\u201d He told Oklahoma\u2019s NewOnSix.com : \u201cIf the Attorney General is aware of individuals engaging in terrorist activities on American soil, those individuals should be in jail. They ought not be free to buy groceries, let alone guns.\u201dThis is not an easy issue or debate. People in Indian country own a lot of guns. (In general people living in rural areas own guns at higher rates than those in cities.) On top of that, we know how important hunting is to most Native Americans.Perhaps, that\u2019s one role for Native politicians. It might take leaders who own guns, those who are lifelong hunters, to rip up their NRA membership cards, and then propose reasonable firearm policies and restrictions.", "article_metadata": {"description": "New America Media is a nationwide association of over 3000 ethnic media organizations representing the development of a more inclusive journalism.
