Taking the place of a gluten-free bakery that emphasized avoidance, Parlor Deluxe will offer downtowners another opportunity at indulgence.

The joint project from Emily Hahn of Warehouse and David Schnell of Browns Court Bakery – conveniently located between their current venues, in the old Sweet Radish Bake Shop – is a contemporary soda fountain. The menu includes ice cream, waffles, hot dogs and tater tots.

According to a press release, “the concept will celebrate classic American culture in a hip and lively setting.”
