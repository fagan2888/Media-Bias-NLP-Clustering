Hundreds of different senses of existing words and thousands of new contextual examples were added as well.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nNet neutrality is defined as \u201cthe idea, principle, or requirement that Internet service providers should or must treat all Internet data as the same regardless of its kind, source, or destination.\u201d\n\nThe FCC attempted to codify that principle this year by approving sweeping rules to reclassify broadband Internet under authority governing traditional telephones.\n\nThat change allowed the commission to write rules to prevent companies like Comcast or Verizon from slowing or blocking Internet traffic from any website. It would also prevent those companies from negotiating deals with websites willing, or able, to pay for priority access.\n\nThe term was coined by Columbia University law professor Tim Wu in a scholarly article in 2003. Despite common usage in the public, the term net neutrality has been largely avoided at the FCC, which instead uses the term \u201copen Internet\u201d to refer to the principle.\n\nMerriam-Webster also included other words like \u201cemoji,\u201d defined as any small image or icon used in electronic communication, and \u201cmeme,\u201d which is \u201cany idea behavior, style or usage that spreads from person to person within a culture.\u201d\n\nAlso in the dictionary is \u201csharing economy,\u201d referring to the proliferation of companies like Airbnb or Uber that help sell the \u201ctemporary access to goods or services.\u201d\n\nMerriam-Webster also now features the words \u201cclick fraud,\u201d and \"clickbait.\"", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "A number of tech terms are among the 1,700 new dictionary entries.", "description": "A number of tech terms are among the 1,700 new dictionary entries.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Mario Trujillo", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "A number of tech terms are among the 1,700 new dictionary entries.", "title": "Merriam-Webster adds 'net neutrality'", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/243177-merriam-webster-defines-net-neutrality", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/iphone_201501getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T03:39-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/243177-merriam-webster-defines-net-neutrality", "dcterms.date": "2015-05-27T09:52-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Mario Trujillo", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Merriam-Webster, Net neutrality,,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-27T09:52:18-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/243177-merriam-webster-defines-net-neutrality", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "A number of tech terms are among the 1,700 new dictionary entries.", "card": "summary", "title": "Merriam-Webster adds 'net neutrality'"}, "dcterms.title": "Merriam-Webster adds 'net neutrality'"}, "article_summary": "Despite common usage in the public, the term net neutrality has been largely avoided at the FCC, which instead uses the term \u201copen Internet\u201d to refer to the principle.\nThe Merriam-Webster unabridged dictionary is adding a number of new tech terms to its latest edition, including \"meme,\" \"emoji,\" and finally \"net neutrality\" after a years-long fight over the concept at the Federal Communications Commission.\nThat change allowed the commission to write rules to prevent companies like Comcast or Verizon from slowing or blocking Internet traffic from any website.\nIt would also prevent those companies from negotiating deals with websites willing, or able, to pay for priority access.\nThe concept is one of more than 1,700 new entries that Merriam-Webster announced this week."}
