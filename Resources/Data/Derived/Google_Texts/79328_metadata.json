Rather, the longtime exclusive financial specialist who owns and operates an Allstate Insurance agency at 2990 Sunridge Heights Parkway in Henderson wants to dispel the myth that life insurance is a cost-prohibitive product for most people.\n\nIn actuality, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s a bargain.\u201d\n\nEspecially when one considers that for the equivalent cost of a weekly cup of java each month, a 30-year-old \u201cpreferred\u201d-rated, nonsmoking male can likely purchase up to $250,000 worth of term life insurance with Allstate for less than $20 in monthly premium payments.\n\nIn the event of his death, that quarter-million dollars in funds could help support the man\u2019s spouse and children as they encounter financial obstacles and commitments in the future, Weinberg said.\n\n\u201cThe worst tragedy to that family is \u2026 the kids have lost their father.\u201d Without life insurance benefits to cover the financial loss of his salary, Weinberg said, \u201cin a few months, they\u2019re also gonna lose their home. \u2026 To recover from that (is) very tough.\n\n\u201cYou buy life insurance for the people you love. You don\u2019t buy life insurance for yourself,\u201d Weinberg said. \u201cIt\u2019s a selfless thing that you have to do for your family. Virtually everyone who has someone dependent upon them needs life insurance.\n\n\u201cGetting people to understand that their loved ones are worth more than (the cost of) a beer or a cup of coffee, and that they need to put away some money for the people that they love\u201d is not easy, he said. \u201cPeople do not want to talk about dying.\u201d\n\nTony Adler, owner and operator of Leo Insurance Group at 8875 W. Flamingo Road, agrees. He said, \u201cPeople think nothing is ever going to happen to them and \u2026 they just never have the money\u201d budgeted for life insurance costs. They \u201cdon\u2019t mind going out and buying the next BMW with an enormous lease payment, but the $25 or $30 in life insurance (premiums) just doesn\u2019t seem like a priority.\u201d\n\nAdler shared the story of a friend of his who died unexpectedly in his mid-30s, leaving behind a wife and young child: \u201cThey (previously) had life insurance. They decided they couldn\u2019t afford it, and they let (the policy) lapse\u201d before the man\u2019s death.\n\nAs a result, the widow became buried beneath a mountain of vehicle and home-mortgage debt. In hindsight, Adler said, \u201cFor 20 or 30 bucks a month, they both could have had at least a few hundred thousand dollars each in life insurance. That hit hard.\u201d\n\nChristopher Zockoll is the financial products division manager for Platinum Risk Management, an insurance services company at 1057 Whitney Ranch Drive in Henderson. \u201cWhen you purchase life insurance, you\u2019re doing it for the other individual \u2026 because there is a need, a desire to ensure that \u2026 the other person continues to move forward financially without you in the picture,\u201d he said.\n\nThe selection process\n\nPeople often don\u2019t take the time to examine the various life insurance products that are available, Zockoll said. \u201cThere are different components of life insurance that people need to understand.\u201d\n\nThe best way to accomplish that is to \u201csit down with an experienced (insurance) agent who is going to ask all of the right questions\u201d and assist clients in purchasing the best products to suit their needs, said Weinberg, adding that Allstate is hiring insurance agents (visit allstate.com/careers.aspx for information).\n\nLike many insurance agents, Adler begins by developing a \u201cneeds analysis\u201d for his customers to determine what they want to accomplish after their death and once a death benefit is paid. That may include covering burial costs and paying off mortgage loans, among other outstanding expenses.\n\nOther clients desire a \u201cmore robust outcome\u201d to continue providing financially for their families, he said. For example, they may want life insurance benefits to fund a child\u2019s college education, or be plentiful enough to ensure that the surviving spouse need not return to the workplace in search of income.\n\n\u201cSo I look at both sides of the coin and try to figure out the best outcome for them,\u201d Adler said.\n\nIndustry experts recommend that individuals purchase 8 to 10 percent of their annual earnings worth of life insurance coverage, but Adler disagrees: \u201cThat\u2019s fine if you\u2019re just looking to pay off debt but \u2026 that still leaves (the beneficiary) with everyday living costs\u201d to cover.\n\nAlso, it\u2019s not a good idea for individuals to rely solely on a life insurance policy offered through their employer to totally meet their death-benefit needs, as such policies usually never provide adequate coverage, Zockoll said.\n\n\u201cBut here\u2019s the bigger dilemma: That insurance most of the time is not portable,\u201d he said, meaning the policy may not move with an individual from job to job.\n\nAlthough the \u201cbreadwinner\u201d of the family should have a life insurance policy in force, Adler said it is equally important for stay-at-home parents to have coverage. The death benefit can help the surviving spouse afford child care costs and other domestic-related necessities.\n\nEven people without a family dependent upon their income should consider purchasing a policy, he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to leave the (financial) burden of your burial and everything that goes around the planning (of it) \u2026 to your beneficiaries, or your heirs, or whoever is left.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Zockoll recommends to business owners that they purchase additional life insurance to help pay for expenses when a key person within their company dies.\n\n\u201cA lot of companies \u2026 have had to close shop because their (business) partner died and they couldn\u2019t afford to pay the (deceased\u2019s) spouse\u201d to purchase their share of the company from them, he said. In such cases, a death benefit could also provide funds to help keep the company afloat financially.\n\nTerm insurance\n\nUltimately, the decision of what type of life insurance product to buy depends \u201con what\u2019s right for the client. That\u2019s why there\u2019s a menu for the client to pick from,\u201d said Zockoll, adding that Platinum Risk Management is hiring additional staffers (visit platinuminsurancellc.com).\n\nTerm life insurance is \u201cpretty straight forward and very vanilla,\u201d he said. It provides renewable coverage for a specified length of time, typically 10 to 30 years.\n\nAlthough term insurance is usually the most affordable product for customers (\u201cEverybody, to some extent, can afford some term insurance,\u201d he said), the downside is \u201cat the end of the term, the premiums increase because you\u2019re older.\u201d\n\nIt is wise, Weinberg said, for people to revisit their term policy before its expiration date to re-evaluate their insurance needs.\n\n\u201cYoung families growing up need lots of coverage,\u201d he said, which term insurance can provide at reasonable rates. As children age, the amount of coverage needed by a family typically lessens and can be changed to reflect that.\n\nThe old insurance industry adage of \u201cbuy term and invest the rest\u201d is a bit of advice often given to life-insurance shoppers who may also be looking to build their investment portfolio. The idea is to purchase low-cost term insurance and invest in the stock market or mutual funds the money they save as a result of not having purchased pricier life insurance products.\n\n\u201cThat sounds great on paper,\u201d Adler said of the theory, \u201cbut most people don\u2019t have the discipline or the structure to continue to invest the rest.\u201d He instead advocates for his customers to \u201cpay themselves first,\u201d for example, by funding an individual retirement account for themselves or a college savings account for their children.\n\nPermanent Insurance\n\nPermanent insurance is divided into four categories: universal life insurance with fixed interest rates, universal life insurance with variable interest rates, indexed universal life insurance and whole life insurance.\n\nUniversal life insurance as \u201ca term policy and investment all built into one policy,\u201d where the cost of the insurance typically is low and most of the premium paid goes toward the investment portion of the policy, Zockoll said.\n\nIf the investment is in a fixed account, it will grow at a fixed interest rate. In a variable account, the premium is invested in a subaccount tied to the stock market.\n\n\u201cIn theory, you can participate in the upward movement of the stock market. Obviously, if the stock market goes down, you could have a negative growth on your cash values,\u201d he said.\n\nZockoll said equity indexed universal life policies are \u201cthe most popular product of all the permanent life insurance right now,\u201d because they allow people to \u201cparticipate in the stock market without the risk of the stock market.\u201d\n\nHe likens the policy to gambling on a slot machine, where \u201cyou put your quarter in (and) you pull the handle.\u201d The difference is if the stock market goes down, the insurance company \u201creturns your quarter back to you and you play again.\u201d\n\nHowever, \u201cIf the market is up and you pulled the handle and won, so to speak \u2026 you voluntarily give a percentage of your winnings back to the insurance company because they\u2019re assuming all the risk.\u201d\n\nZockoll said equity indexed universal life policies make sense for \u201cpeople who don\u2019t know what the (stock) market can do or don\u2019t understand it or can\u2019t watch it \u2026 because they\u2019ll still get a percentage of the market without the market risk.\u201d\n\nWhole life insurance \u201cis a totally guaranteed product,\u201d he said. Although the dividends it pays are not certain, a policy\u2019s cash-value growth is generally guaranteed upfront.\n\nAlso, \u201cWhole life is exactly what it says \u2014 it will be there for your whole life. If you live to be 100, whole life is still there for you to pay that death benefit.\u201d\n\nBecause whole life is typically the most expensive of all insurance products, however, its premiums keep it out of reach for many consumers. \u201cFor people who are younger or who are trying to build their financial careers, they\u2019re not in a position to pay that much in premium for the death benefit they need,\u201d Zockoll said.\n\nFor those who can afford to purchase it, whole life insurance does have an upside: As years progress, policyholders can borrow against a policy\u2019s accumulated cash value to supplement retirement incomes, among other uses.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really like a loan to you, and you never have to pay taxes on that money,\u201d said Adler, whose Leo Insurance Group is hiring sales agents (visit leoinsurancegroup.com). \u201cSo (when) you pass away, the beneficiaries will get the life insurance (benefit) minus what you took out of it.\u201d\n\nGiven that the nation is still recovering from an economic downturn, Adler said he thinks people these days are more willing to consider purchasing permanent life insurance as opposed to term insurance. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to look at the other side and know that it is always going to be there for you.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no arguing with the peace of mind that life insurance coverage can provide, said Weinberg, who delivers about a dozen death-benefit checks annually to his clients\u2019 beneficiaries.\n\nAlthough every death \u201cis a tragedy,\u201d he said, \u201cthe difference is while the next-door neighbor is bringing (the surviving spouse) a casserole, I\u2019m bringing a quarter-million or half-million dollar check. That\u2019s not going to bring (the deceased) home, but \u2026 when I deliver it, a lot of their worries go by the wayside.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"parsely-link": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/life-insurance-need-not-be-expensive", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "LISA FERGUSON", "parsely-title": "Life insurance need not be expensive", "parsely-image-url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_177179985.jpg", "twitter": {"description": "Instead of ordering another frothy, overpriced latte at the corner coffee shop, Melvin Weinberg hopes you\u2019ll consider purchasing some life insurance.", "creator": {"identifier": "@reviewjournal", "id": 15358759}, "url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/life-insurance-need-not-be-expensive", "image": {"src": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_177179985.jpg, http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_179973335.jpg"}, "title": "Life insurance need not be expensive", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-pub-date": "2013-10-22T20:28:25Z", "vf": {"unique_id": "reviewjournal-nid-803891"}, "al": {"web": {"should_fallback": "true"}, "android": {"url": "review-journal://?eid=277638", "app_name": "review-journal", "package": "com.LVRJ"}, "ios": {"url": "review-journal://?eid=277638", "app_store_id": 540820524, "app_name": "review-journal"}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1098299519", "fb": {"admins": 630759385, "app_id": 195491203833571}, "google-play-app": "app-id=com.LVRJ", "parsely-author": "LISA FERGUSON", "parsely-section": "News", "keywords": "News,,", "parsely-type": "post", "article": {"published_time": "2013-10-22T13:28:25-07:00"}, "parsely-tags": "News", "og": {"site_name": "Las Vegas Review-Journal", "description": "Instead of ordering another frothy, overpriced latte at the corner coffee shop, Melvin Weinberg hopes you\u2019ll consider purchasing some life insurance.", "title": "Life insurance need not be expensive", "url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/life-insurance-need-not-be-expensive", "image": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_177179985.jpg", "type": "article"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=0.9", "description": "Instead of ordering another frothy, overpriced latte at the corner coffee shop, Melvin Weinberg hopes you\u2019ll consider purchasing some life insurance."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfb3a\"", "article_summary": "Permanent InsurancePermanent insurance is divided into four categories: universal life insurance with fixed interest rates, universal life insurance with variable interest rates, indexed universal life insurance and whole life insurance.\nTerm life insurance is \u201cpretty straight forward and very vanilla,\u201d he said.\n\u201cSo (when) you pass away, the beneficiaries will get the life insurance (benefit) minus what you took out of it.\u201dGiven that the nation is still recovering from an economic downturn, Adler said he thinks people these days are more willing to consider purchasing permanent life insurance as opposed to term insurance.\nThey \u201cdon\u2019t mind going out and buying the next BMW with an enormous lease payment, but the $25 or $30 in life insurance (premiums) just doesn\u2019t seem like a priority.\u201dAdler shared the story of a friend of his who died unexpectedly in his mid-30s, leaving behind a wife and young child: \u201cThey (previously) had life insurance.\n\u201cYoung families growing up need lots of coverage,\u201d he said, which term insurance can provide at reasonable rates."}
