AMC President Charlie Collier had one major job when it came to marketing the final season of “Mad Men”: “To put it in the hall of fame.”

The second leg of the hit drama’s seventh and final season begins April 5, and while the show has already been a critical darling with an upscale audience, AMC is giving it an extra marketing push through the finish line.

One task has been to excite Madison Avenue types. After all, the show is about the advertising industry.

Mr. Collier said that a top ad executive told him his firm was participating in “Mad Men Dining Week,” a promotion offering lunchtime prix-fixe menus and cocktails at some Manhattan staples like Barbetta. To be sure, ad men and women these days aren’t allowed to get as sauced at lunch as Don and Roger did in the 60s.

And outside of the Time-Life Building in New York, where Don Draper held court at the show’s fictional ad agency, AMC has set up a “Draper Bench” reminiscent of the silhouetted “Mad Men” title sequence. At the Museum of the Moving Image in Queens, diehards can tour a new exhibit with sets, props and scripts from the show.

Mr. Collier said AMC was also making a digital push though things like celebrity tribute videos. In one spot, for example, comedian Sarah Silverman discusses how she missed out on being cast in the series.

It has been a busy few days for Mr. Collier. CMO Today spoke with him as he waited to fly out of Los Angeles, where AMC on Wednedsday hosted a black-tie fête debuting the show’s last premiere episode.

Mr. Collier was headed to Washington, where The Smithsonian Museum of American History will add “Mad Men” materials to its collection.

“Next to Archie Bunker’s chair will be elements of Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce,” Mr. Collier said.
