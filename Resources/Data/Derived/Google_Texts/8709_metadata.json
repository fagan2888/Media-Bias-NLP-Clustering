It claimed the refund in a 2008 quarterly report, but the federal government rejected the claim, citing the statute of limitations. Georgia appealed to a Medicaid administrative board and when that failed, in 2013 to the courts.\n\n\u201cGeorgia\u2019s ineptitude in making errors and delay in discovering them is confounding, but does not justify permitting the federal government to keep the $90 million in credits to the detriment of Georgia\u2019s 1.89 million Medicaid recipients,\u201d U.S. District Judge Gladys Kessler wrote (pdf) in her opinion.\n\nKessler explained that Georgia\u2019s poor shouldn\u2019t suffer because of a mistake of state employees. \u201cThe population of the state of Georgia is roughly 9.8 million, and approximately 1.89 million of those people were enrolled in Medicaid in 2013. Put in perspective, close to 20 percent of Georgia\u2019s population is enrolled in Medicaid. These are the people who will be hurt the most by Georgia\u2019s administrative errors and the subsequent crediting of $90 million of Georgia\u2019s Medicaid credits to CMS [Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services]. It is Georgia\u2019s poor, elderly, disabled and pregnant populations that will suffer the most should these administrative errors stand uncorrected.\u201d\n\nOf course the administrative errors have been fixed, but Georgia\u2019s poor are still being hurt by their elected officials: The state has yet to accept the Medicaid expansion offered under the Affordable Care Act, leaving thousands of Georgians without healthcare.\n\n-Steve Straehley\n\nTo Learn More:\n\nU.S. Must Face Georgia\u2019s Claim for $90M Refund (by Iulia Filip, Courthouse News Service)\n\nGeorgia Department Of Community Health v.
