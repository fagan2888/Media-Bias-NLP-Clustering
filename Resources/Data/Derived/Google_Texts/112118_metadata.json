To ensure they\u2019re kicking until they\u2019re delivered into the world, a new initiative, the \u201cPregnant and Empowered\u201d campaign has launched, and it's dedicated to educating mothers on prenatal health. The program was unveiled right before Mother\u2019s Day as a gift for mommies-to-be, designed to minimize the risks associated with premature labor and stillbirths.\n\n\u201cThere is something we can do to help moms have safer births,\u201d the CEO of First Candle, Christopher Blake, said at the Pregnant and Empowered campaign launch. He joined the nonprofit organization, which aims at ensuring safer pregnancies, in an effort to increase survival rates of babies within their first years of life. \u201cGiving women a voice is important. If women can\u2019t find their voice and speak about what\u2019s going on with them, there\u2019s a lot of danger that could come from that.\u201d\n\nExperts believe it starts with stillbirth: \u201cthe conversation no one wants to have,\u201d according to Blake. This month marks the first time stillbirth has been included as an agenda at the American Congress of Obstetrics and Gynecology. Stillbirth still stands as a significant issue in the United States. One out of every 160 pregnancies ends in fetal death after 20 weeks of pregnancy, according to March of Dimes.\n\n\u201cDollar-for-dollar the most important thing we can do is watch fetal movement and count kicks,\u201d Blake said, quoting Dr. Ruth Fretts, an OB/GYN and reproductive biology professor at Harvard Medical School, at the pregnancy symposium. The new campaign provides charts for pregnant women to count their baby\u2019s kicks every day during their last trimester. By counting kicks, the mother is able to receive mood and health messages by tracking their normal movement pattern. It\u2019s one of the few forms of the communication baby has, and no one else will know it better than mom herself.\n\n\u201cThe problem is when people present providers with decreased fetal movement into any labor unit, it\u2019s like the roll of a dice,\u201d Fretts said. \u201cIf you happen to believe it\u2019s important, then you\u2019re going to get more care, and if you\u2019re given a provider who happens to think it isn\u2019t important, then you\u2019re going to be sent home. It\u2019s really a missed opportunity to evaluate and say, \u2018OK, this is a risk factor.\u2019\u201d\n\nReduced fetal movement (RFM) is a medical symptom, similar to if your glands are swollen \u2014 they indicate something is wrong. When the baby moves less, it should serve as an alarm to mothers who need to see their provider in order to ensure the baby is still healthy and OK.\n\nSometimes the baby\u2019s simply sleeping, or the mother\u2019s own maternal stress, sleep patterns, or nutrition choices are the cause. However, in more dire situations there could be a premature rupture or leak in the amniotic sac that holds the baby, or another possibility is there\u2019s a blood clot in the umbilical cord, which transports food and nutrition to the baby. Mothers therefore need to listen to their baby and become their voice until they\u2019re old enough to have their own.\n\nCurrently, the \u201cnuMoM2B Heart Health Study,\u201d which is still in clinical trials, is tracking sleep position, sleep disordered breathing, and the cardiovascular health and pregnancy outcomes. Fretts believes physician knowledge will improve along with new parents who can learn what\u2019s best for the baby and mother during pregnancy.\n\nBecoming Baby\u2019s Advocate\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of conversation around stillbirth \u2014 improving outcomes, prevention, the bereavement component \u2014 but no one really ever talks about how we can empower women,\u201d said the co-founder of Action for Stillbirth Awareness and Prevention Coalition Debbie Haine Vijayvergiya, who lost her own baby in 2011 to stillbirth at 28 weeks.\n\nHer life\u2019s work became safe pregnancy advocacy. Within the three years after Vijayvergiya delivered her lifeless baby girl, she studied the political process, learned the steps it took to draft legislation, and watched New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie sign the Autumn Joy Stillbirth Research and Dignity Act. The law, named after the daughter she lost, requires the state to establish policies to ensure dignified and sensitive management for each stillbirth, along with providing consultation, psychology, and social work resources.\n\n\u201cFrom the minute that you take a pregnancy test and you see that it shows up positive, your inner advocate is born,\u201d Vijayvergiya said. \u201cIt manifests in different ways. Suddenly you say, \u2018Can I eat that? Should I drink that? I should go to bed at this hour now\u2019 or \u2018I shouldn\u2019t go skydiving this weekend.\u2019 Suddenly you are thinking about someone other than yourself. There\u2019s other larger ways that it can manifest and in order to empower women and become an advocate for a child, she also needs to understand she is entitled to go to her doctor when she has concerns. But it all starts with knowing your baby and counting their kicks.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "mothers, day, empowerment, soon, be, moms, how, ensure, healthy, pregnancies", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Mothers learn to empower themselves by listening to their babies' kicks and voicing their concerns.", "title": "In Advocating For Their Baby's Health, Mothers Find A Voice", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/mothers-day-empowerment-soon-be-moms-how-ensure-healthy-pregnancies-332432", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/05/07/empowering-pregnant-women.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Mothers learn to empower themselves by listening to their babies' kicks and voicing their concerns.", "title": "In Advocating For Their Baby's Health, Mothers Find A Voice", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/mothers-day-empowerment-soon-be-moms-how-ensure-healthy-pregnancies-332432", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/05/07/empowering-pregnant-women.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/05/07/empowering-pregnant-women.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Vitality", "published_time": "2015-05-07T17:31:31-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-07T17:31:30-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Mothers learn to empower themselves by listening to their babies' kicks and voicing their concerns."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2c13\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe problem is when people present providers with decreased fetal movement into any labor unit, it\u2019s like the roll of a dice,\u201d Fretts said.\nOne out of every 160 pregnancies ends in fetal death after 20 weeks of pregnancy, according to March of Dimes.\nThe program was unveiled right before Mother\u2019s Day as a gift for mommies-to-be, designed to minimize the risks associated with premature labor and stillbirths.\nThe new campaign provides charts for pregnant women to count their baby\u2019s kicks every day during their last trimester.\nMothers therefore need to listen to their baby and become their voice until they\u2019re old enough to have their own."}
