Bock had severe mental illness and was later found incompetent to stand trial. He was released on bail, but was rearrested after he failed to appear at a court hearing.\n\nBock, 56, was placed in the Sutter County jail, awaiting transfer to a state hospital. While there, he began suffering hallucinations. After more than two weeks in jail, Bock hanged himself.\n\n\u2018Jail is simply too dangerous a place for these most vulnerable defendants.\u2019\n\nMicaela Davis, ACLU attorney\n\nMentally ill defendants declared incompetent to stand trial, as Bock was, are supposed to be transferred to state mental hospitals for treatment within two or three months. But more than 300 of them statewide are languishing in county jails because there\u2019s simply no bed space.\n\nBock\u2019s daughters are now plaintiffs in a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union, charging two state agencies, including the Department of State Hospitals, with denying mentally ill inmates their right to due process \u2014 and the treatment they need.\n\n\u201cJail is simply too dangerous a place for these most vulnerable defendants,\u201d said Micaela Davis, lead attorney in the lawsuit. \u201cWe have inmates that are waiting eight, nine months and sometimes over a year before being transferred to a facility for treatment.\u201d\n\nCalifornia\u2019s new state budget includes more than $17 million to add beds for defendants declared incompetent to stand trial. But not everyone agrees that\u2019s the best approach.\n\nStephen Manley is a mental health court judge in Santa Clara County. His court helps defendants struggling with severe mental illnesses, including bipolar disorder or schizophrenia, find alternatives to incarceration.\n\nManley doesn\u2019t want more psychiatric hospital beds; he wants to reserve state hospitals for the most violent defendants.\n\n\u201cWe send far too many people to state hospitals who do not pose a risk to public safety,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause we don\u2019t work with them to figure out if there isn\u2019t a local alternative.\u201d\n\nManley believes the psychiatric hospitals are already overcrowded \u2014 and understaffed. \u201cAs long as we keep overcrowding the hospitals, all we do is feed the fire,\u201d he says, referring to violence within the hospitals.\n\nThere were more than 1,800 physical assaults at Napa State Hospital last year alone. Hospital officials say patients who are there to have their sanity restored for trial inflict the most serious injuries.\n\nRyan Navarre, with the organization representing Napa Hospital police, says that even officers are at risk. He recalled one patient specifically who put rocks into his socks and then spun them around \u201cviolently,\u201d he said.\n\nState psychiatric hospitals continue working to find a balance between treatment and security for patients and staff.\n\nMeanwhile, Manley thinks the best solution for nonviolent offenders is to create more community-based treatment facilities.\n\n\u201cIf we add another 500 beds people to a state hospital, all we do is make the problem worse,\u201d he says.\n\nBut funding is already inadequate for mental health treatment. And creating more community-based programs raises new challenges \u2014 including resistance from neighbors who don\u2019t really want to live near facilities whose clients are mentally ill criminal defendants.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hundreds of mentally ill defendants statewide are housed in county jails, because there's no room for them at state hospitals.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Long, Dangerous Wait for Hospital Beds for Those Incompetent to Stand Trial\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2015\\/10\\/20\\/long-dangerous-wait-for-hospital-beds-for-those-incompetent-to-stand-trial\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-10-20 00:07:49\",\"mod_date\":\"2015-10-20 10:53:15\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":94876,\"author_id\":\"255\",\"author_name\":\"Scott Shafer\",\"author_display_name\":\"Scott Shafer\",\"tags\":[\"Mental Health\",\"Napa State Hospital\",\"News\"],\"categories\":[\"Community Health\",\"Tests &amp; Treatments\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2015\\/10\\/iStock_000001434408_Large-e1445298258648.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "Hundreds of mentally ill defendants statewide are housed in county jails, because there's no room for them at state hospitals.", "title": "Long, Dangerous Wait for Hospital Beds for Those Incompetent to Stand Trial", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2015/10/20/long-dangerous-wait-for-hospital-beds-for-those-incompetent-to-stand-trial/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2015/10/iStock_000001434408_Large-1440x1211.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@scottshafer"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "mental health,napa state hospital,news", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cIf we add another 500 beds people to a state hospital, all we do is make the problem worse,\u201d he says.\nBock had severe mental illness and was later found incompetent to stand trial.\n\u201cWe send far too many people to state hospitals who do not pose a risk to public safety,\u201d he says.\nThere were more than 1,800 physical assaults at Napa State Hospital last year alone.\nManley doesn\u2019t want more psychiatric hospital beds; he wants to reserve state hospitals for the most violent defendants."}
