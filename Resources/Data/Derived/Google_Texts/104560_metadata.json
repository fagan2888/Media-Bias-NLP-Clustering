Most likely, the lower courts will split again, and the issue will come back to the Supreme Court. By then, there might be nine justices to decide it.\n\nLogin required We have used your information to see if you have a subscription with us. So far we have not found one.

After oral arguments, the justices tried to force a compromise by telling lawyers for the government and the religious groups seeking the exemption to engage in further briefing. The court\u2019s goal was to produce a compromise, but when the briefs came in, there was none to be had.\n\nDespite the failure of its initiative, the court patted itself on the back on Monday, saying in a unanimous unsigned opinion that the supplemental briefing had \u201csignificantly clarified\u201d the parties\u2019 positions. Significant clarification is in the eye of the beholder, I guess. I actually think the case is more complicated now than it was before the supplemental briefing.\n\nThe court then basically told the appellate courts to try to force the federal government and the religious groups to compromise. \u201cThe parties,\u201d said the court, \u201cshould be afforded an opportunity to arrive at an approach going forward that accommodates petitioners\u2019 religious exercise while at the same time ensuring that women covered by petitioners\u2019 health plans receive full and equal health coverage, including contraceptive coverage.\u201d And the court told the appellate courts to \u201callow the parties sufficient time to resolve any outstanding issues between them.\u201d\n\nThis is wishful thinking. The case arose because some religious organizations want to do everything they can to block the Affordable Care Act\u2019s requirement that health insurance plans cover contraceptive care. Their tool was the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, already deployed for this purpose by the Supreme Court in 2014 in the 5-4 Hobby Lobby case.\n\nThe Catholic organizations in this case employ non-Catholics as part of their social service mission. The Obama administration tried to reach compromise with them by providing that they wouldn\u2019t have to pay for contraceptive care for those employees. All costs would be covered by the organizations\u2019 insurers.\n\nBut the Catholic organizations wouldn\u2019t agree to the deal. They raised a range of different claims, and indeed their arguments shifted markedly over the course of litigation. At one time, the central claim was that they objected to filing a form with the government that specified that they wanted the exemption. Now the central claim is that providing for contraceptive care through their existing insurance plans counted as \u201chijacking\u201d those plans.\n\nThe shift demonstrates that the real goal of the organizations is not to take any deal at all. The Obama administration wants employees to get coverage \u201cseamlessly,\u201d that is through their own doctors and insurers. The religious organizations seem unwilling to accept anything other than active disruption. Their reasoning is principled: They think contraception is immoral, and they want to do anything they can to make it harder to get. If they can derail any part of the contraceptive care mandate, they will.\n\nSo don\u2019t expect a compromise before the appellate courts. Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote separately on Monday to clarify that the appeals courts \u201cshould not construe\u201d the justices\u2019 efforts to forge a compromise as a signal \u201cof where this court stands.\u201d She emphasized the seamlessness requirement.\n\nThe point of her concurrence, joined by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, was to tell the appeals courts that had previously held for the government not to soften their stance on the basis of the court\u2019s apparent desire to compromise. She was making it clear that the proposed compromise was a function of the 4-4 court. When the case makes it back to the Supreme Court, there may be a liberal majority. Sotomayor wants to be sure that the liberal side wins this one.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Tulsa World", "description": "The Supreme Court's do-over on the question of religious exemptions from the Affordable Care Act's contraceptive care mandate is bizarre, but it reflects the weirdness of an eight-justice court.", "title": "Noah Feldman: There won't be a deal in 'Obamacare' religion fight", "url": "http://www.tulsaworld.com/opinion/noahfeldman/noah-feldman-there-won-t-be-a-deal-in-obamacare/article_7ed55bfd-a857-54dd-a954-39c55638ec76.html", "image": "http://www.tulsaworld.com/app/tulsa_world_ogimage.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@tulsaworld", "card": "summary"}, "description": "The Supreme Court's do-over on the question of religious exemptions from the Affordable Care Act's contraceptive care mandate is bizarre, but it reflects the weirdness of an eight-justice court.", "fb": {"app_id": 288003941350366}, "keywords": "appellate court,justice,religious organization,compromise,requirement,insurer,feldman,noah,supreme court,noah feldman,ruth bader ginsburg,constitutional and international law,professor of constitutional and international law,view columnist,health insurance plans cover contraceptive care,obama administration,sonia sotomayor,federal government,harvard university,insurance plans,bloomberg,tulsa world,editorial,noahfeldman,othervoices", "news_keywords": "appellate court,justice,religious organization,compromise,requirement,insurer,feldman,noah,supreme court,noah feldman,ruth bader ginsburg,constitutional and international law,professor of constitutional and international law,view columnist,health insurance plans cover contraceptive care,obama administration,sonia sotomayor,federal government,harvard university,insurance plans,bloomberg,tulsa world,editorial,noahfeldman,othervoices"}, "article_summary": "Now the central claim is that providing for contraceptive care through their existing insurance plans counted as \u201chijacking\u201d those plans.\nWhen the case makes it back to the Supreme Court, there may be a liberal majority.\nMost likely, the lower courts will split again, and the issue will come back to the Supreme Court.\nIf they can derail any part of the contraceptive care mandate, they will.\nThe religious organizations seem unwilling to accept anything other than active disruption."}
