Last week at a press conference ahead of this year\u2019s Final Four in Indianapolis, Krzyzewski \u2013 who reportedly earns $9.6 million a year \u2013 refused to talk about Indiana\u2019s religious freedom law that had caused such an uproar, saying his job was basketball, not politics (he later endorsed his school\u2019s sentiments about the law). Coack K, however, has been active in Republican politics, hosting a fundraiser for then-U.S. Senate candidate Elizabeth Dole of North Carolina. He also took a jab at President Barack Obama in 2009 when Obama left Duke out of his finals bracket that year. Here\u2019s your Three-Minute Briefing, all the News You Can Use in 180 seconds or less:\n\nFSBO: As the world continues to digest news of a framework for a no-nukes, no-sanctions deal with Iran, Obama\u2019s working hard to sell it through his favorite news outlets. He did an NPR interview Monday in which he compared the tentative deal to a house under contract, albeit a house with nuclear material in the basement and in a pretty unstable neighborhood that gets a lot of cop calls. But the president also took a swipe at Scott Walker, the Wisconsin governor and would-be presidential contender who said he\u2019d chuck the deal, first thing, if he made it to the White House: Walker might change his mind \u201cafter taking some time to bone up on foreign policy,\u201d Obama said.\n\n[READ: Who Gets What Out of the Iran Nuclear Deal]\n\n30 Nuclear Experts Can\u2019t Be Wrong: The president\u2019s got at least one group of independents who back him up on the Iraq deal: a consortium of 30 nuclear non-proliferation experts. In an open letter to critics of the deal \u2013 looking at you, Sen. Tom Cotton and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \u2013 the scientists, scholars and diplomats shoved back hard: The deal, they wrote, will curb Iran\u2019s appetite for the bomb, allows enhanced levels of inspections to catch them if they backslide and (this one\u2019s for you, Bibi) is a giant step toward regional peace that won\u2019t trigger an arms race in the region.\n\nOr Can They?: But Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, in line to succeed Minority Leader Harry Reid as the Senate\u2019s top Democrat, isn\u2019t buying the arguments of those nuclear eggheads. He\u2019s backing legislation that would give Congress the authority to reject it outright, and it\u2019s close to getting enough votes to override a presidential veto.\n\nRand Stands Alone: Now that he\u2019s officially entered the 2016 race for the Republican presidential nomination, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul\u2019s record is getting a lot more scrutiny these days. U.S. News\u2019 Dave Catanese reports the scrutiny includes a look at Paul\u2019s semi-isolationist, mostly libertarian worldview that favors \u201cpeace through strength\u201d (aka throwing more money at the military) but isn\u2019t all that interested in playing offense on defense (aka invading certain foreign nations). That sets him apart from most of the 2016 field so far, most of whom want to bulk up the military \u2013 along with the power to use it.\n\nKnow the DIfference: In case you\u2019re coming late to the Rand Paul party, the good folks at Mother Jones have put together a helpful primer on everything you want to know about the candidate: his background, why you should vote for him \u2013 or not \u2013 and how libertarian Rand Paul deals with Libertarian Ron Paul, his dad and a former long shot presidential candidate.\n\n[ALSO Rand Paul Stands Alone]\n\nTo Your Health: Despite killer storms, rising sea levels and a record drought in the nation's salad bowl, the climate change debate continues in Congress and actual action seems far over the smog-filled horizon. That\u2019s probably why Obama\u2019s not taking any chances with the nation\u2019s health. On Tuesday, he unveiled a series of initiatives to help mitigate the effects of global warming, which is expected to trigger longer, hotter summers, colder winters, a jump in asthma rates, a longer allergy season and other respiratory ailments.\n\nMaking It Rain: Less than half of the nation believes that climate change is mainly a result of human activity. But U.S. News\u2019 Alan Neuhauser reports California hedge-fund billionaire Tom Steyer thinks his money can pin down GOP presidential candidates on the issue.\n\nDownton White House: It\u2019s been said that household staff are barely noticed if they do their jobs properly. In a new book, members of the White House household service must\u2019ve served well, because they\u2019re able to give readers a behind-the-scenes glimpse of what life\u2019s really like in 1600 Pennsylvania Ave., from the folksiness of President George W. Bush to the fighting between President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton and the adjustments the Obamas have had to make since taking over the ultimate government housing.\n\nYour Morning Video: In what could be a metaphor for the Iran no-nukes deal, Obama tries to calm kiddie hysteria when a bee interrupts his White House Easter Egg Roll dramatic reading of \u201cWhere the Wild Things Are\u201d:\n\nStat of the Day: State (or pseudo-state) with the highest percentage of adult residents who think global warming is man-made, according to the Yale Project on Climate Change Communication: District of Columbia (61 percent). With the lowest percentage: Wyoming (42 percent).\n\nTweet of the Morning:They\u2019re not called the Duke Blue Devils for nothing:\n\nYou're welcome, #Duke. You know why. \u2014 Francis J. Underwood (@RepUnderwoodSC) April 7, 2015\n\n\n\nDuly Noted: On this date in 1788, Gen. Rufus Putnam\u2019s expedition established a settlement at present-day Marietta, Ohio. Union forces led by Gen.
