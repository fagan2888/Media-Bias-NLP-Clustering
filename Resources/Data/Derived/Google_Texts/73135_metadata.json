How\u2019s a viewer to keep up? To help you sort through all that television has to offer, Flavorwire is compiling the five best moments on TV each week. This time: How to Get Away with Murder shows its title murder (spoiler ahead) \u2014 but hasn\u2019t explained how to get away with it. Yet.\n\nHow to Get Away With Murder Gets Its Murderer\n\nIt was Wes, with the trophy, in Annalise\u2019s house! Despite her husband being dead, her husband was also a huge jerk who knocked up his mistress, so Annalise\u2019s response when Wes says he\u2019s sorry is, \u201cDon\u2019t be.\u201d It\u2019s awesome! And the last we\u2019ll see of How to Get Away With Murder until next year.\n\nOlivia Pope Chooses Herself\n\nShortly before being kidnapped, but still! For a few sweet minutes, Kerry Washington boogies around a living room while telling Scott Foley that she wants both Jake and Fitz, and if either of them want her to make a final decision anytime soon they\u2019re crazy, because she chooses herself over either of them. Not that anyone in the audience understands why Fitz is still in the running.\n\n\u2026 And Jane Villanueva Chooses Rafael\n\nOne of Jane the Virgin\u2018s many, many subplots is the love triangle between the title character, her cop fianc\u00e9 Michael, and her former crush/inadvertent baby daddy Rafael. Just six episodes into the series and that triangle\u2019s already broken; Jane breaks up with Michael for lying to her about knowing Rafael\u2019s wife Petra was cheating on him with his (now-dead) best friend Zaz \u2014 see, lots of subplots! \u2014 and goes running into Rafael\u2019s arms, complete with a dramatic, swept-off-her-feet makeout. It\u2019s worthy of a telenovela, which makes sense given that the show\u2019s based on one.\n\n#TrueDetectiveSeasonOne, Reprise\n\nSaturday Night Live\u2018s Woody Harrelson/Kendrick Lamar episode is widely agreed to be the 40th season\u2019s best so far, although the high point wasn\u2019t a performance from either. Instead, Harrelson played the dangerously-close-to-breaking sidekick to Taran Killam\u2019s phenomenal Matthew McConaughey, who\u2019s an ardent fan of weird nicknames and the Mario theme music. Watch them square off with Weekend Update co-host Colin Jost above.\n\n<div style=\u201dbackground-color:#000000;width:480px;\u201d><div style=\u201dpadding:4px;\u201d>\n\nhttp://thecolbertreport.cc.com/\u201d>The Colbert Report\n\nGet More: http://thecolbertreport.cc.com/full-episodes\u201d>Colbert Report Full Episodes,https://www.facebook.com/thecolbertreport\u201d>The Colbert Report on Facebook,http://thecolbertreport.cc.com/videos\u201d>Video Archive\n\nToni Morrison Meets Stephen Colbert, Disaster Does Not Ensue\n\nAn author who made her name by documenting the African-American experience and a colorblind \u201cconservative\u201d pundit may not be a natural match, but Stephen Colbert\u2019s sit-down with Toni Morrison is a fine way to kick off the character\u2019s last month on air before his creator moves on to CBS. Morrison is soft-spoken and game for Colbert\u2019s jokes \u2014 she takes full responsibility for Obamacare, BTW \u2014 while getting deadly serious in a discussion on the difference between the fiction of race and the reality of racism. Oh, and she\u2019s a huge fan of her own work.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/flavorwire-2016/img/ms-icon-144x144.png", "description": "There are scores of TV shows out there, with dozens of new episodes each week, not to mention everything you can find on Hulu Plus, Netflix streaming, and HBO Go.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "Flavorwire", "description": "There are scores of TV shows out there, with dozens of new episodes each week, not to mention everything you can find on Hulu Plus, Netflix streaming, and HBO Go.
