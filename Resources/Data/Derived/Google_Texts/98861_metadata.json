The company\u2019s aim is to offer products that taste as good or better than their egg-based counterparts, that are cheaper to use, better for diners\u2019 health, and far better for the environment than intensive animal agriculture practices that produce the majority of the 1.8 trillion eggs laid globally each year.\n\nThe company\u2019s first product was an egg alternative called Beyond Eggs (for Food Manufacturers) that Hampton Creek sold in bulk, 50-pound packs to major food manufacturers.\n\nBut more recently, Hampton Creek has struck a distribution deal with Whole Foods Market Inc. for its first mainstream consumer product Just Mayo. The startup also works with a number of other large groceries, fast food chains, convenience stores and major food manufacturers, who are selling or using Just Mayo, Mr. Tetrick said.\n\nHampton Creek plans to use its funding to grow its manufacturing operations, fulfill orders, strike new distribution deals, and to expand significantly beyond the U.S., especially in China. That\u2019s one reason the company sought funding from Li Ka-shing\u2019s Horizons Ventures, Mr. Tetrick said.\n\nThe CEO said he also expects one-third to one-half of the new funding to go towards research and development of new products that would replace eggs in a variety of food items.\n\nhamptoncreekfoods.com Left to right: Hampton Creek Foods\u2019 Johan Boot (VP of R&D) and Josh Tetrick (CEO)\n\nAccording to Collaborative Fund Venture Partner Kanyi Maqubela, the firm sees Hampton Creek as the \u201cbiggest possible consumer play there is, given that food is this pervasive, universal need.\u201d\n\nHe expects the company to focus on distribution, keeping its supply chain efficient and competitive in 2014, and building international brand awareness.\n\nMr. Tetrick noted that the global market for mayo alone every year, according to Euromonitor International Ltd. reports, tops $11 billion. He added that there are 79 billion eggs laid in the U.S. alone each year, and one-third of them wind up \u201cliving inside\u201d of products like cookies, muffins and other doughy delights, where consumers aren\u2019t aware of them.\n\n\u201cWe want to make eggs obsolete,\u201d the CEO said. \u201cMost people would be appalled if they saw where the eggs in their favorite foods are coming from\u2026and the treatment of chickens in this intensive, animal agriculture system.\u201d\n\nVenture investments in food rose in 2013. General food products attracted at least $47.3 million in institutional funding last year, according to Dow Jones VentureSource data, about a 22% increase over the $38.7 million invested in the category in 2012.\n\nWrite to Lora Kolodny at lora.kolodny@wsj.com.
