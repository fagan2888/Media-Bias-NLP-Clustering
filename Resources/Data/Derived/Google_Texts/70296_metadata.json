Tom Reed is taking matters into his own hands.\n\nCongressional sources said that Reed stood up at a private meeting of GOP House members on Thursday and told them that he was there for them when they tried to defund Obamacare \u2013 and that they owe a favor to him and to other electorally endangered lawmakers by backing a temporary hike in the debt ceiling.\n\nMoreover, Reed has been working with a handful of other lawmakers to develop a plan that would not only end the shutdown and the current impasse in Washington, but also aim to prevent them from recurring over the next three years. The plan would allow the debt ceiling to increase automatically and annually so long as Congress meets preset goals involving spending cuts, tax reform and entitlement reform.\n\n\u201cThe more that we can come together, the more that we can agree to address these issues long term, I think that makes us stronger and gets us away from government by crisis,\u201d said Reed, R-Corning.\n\nThat\u2019s something Reed clearly wants to do \u2013 perhaps partly to avoid a political crisis of his own. Reed faces a well-funded Democratic challenger, Tompkins County Legislature Chairwoman Martha Robertson, in a sprawling Southern Tier district where many conservative Republicans are sandwiched between Democrats in Chautauqua County and Ithaca.\n\nAs a result, even Republicans worry about Reed\u2019s future \u2013 and on Thursday, he spoke up for himself and other lawmakers in the same situation, challenging the GOP\u2019s tea party wing during a private party conference.\n\nNoting that he and other lawmakers from competitive districts were now under fire for the government shutdown the tea party members created, Reed told his colleagues that they should support a six-week extension of the debt ceiling, congressional sources said.\n\nReed refused to discuss exactly what he said, saying he has a policy of not speaking about what happens in private party conferences. But he acknowledged that his emphasis on the debt ceiling fit into the larger budget strategy he has been developing with Rep. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., and a handful of other lawmakers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a piece of a puzzle that we\u2019re trying to put together,\u201d he said. It\u2019s a complicated puzzle, but Reed has been spelling it out in meetings of small groups of his colleagues \u2013 Democrats included.\n\nUnder the still-evolving plan, one year the debt ceiling would increase automatically if Congress came up with a long-term budget plan that cuts spending. Another year, the debt ceiling would increase automatically if Congress passes tax reform. And another year, the debt ceiling would go up automatically if Congress were to enact cost-saving changes to the fiscally challenged Social Security and Medicare programs.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m envisioning here would probably require help from the other side,\u201d Reed acknowledged. \u201cDo I see 218 Republicans signing onto this? No.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a far cry from the way Reed was talking just a few weeks ago, when he voiced full-throttled support for tying the continued funding of the government to either defunding or delaying President Obama\u2019s signature health care reform law.\n\nReed said he still believes Obamacare ought to be stopped, but at the same time, he\u2019s talking like a politician who knows a dead end when he sees one. He noted, for example, that there is growing frustration in the House with Sen. Ted Cruz, the Republican tea party favorite from Texas who hatched the strategy that led to the government shutdown.\n\n\u201cThere are people that are now disenfranchised with the senator from Texas, who are, like, \u2018OK, we\u2019re here \u2013 what now?\u2019 \u201d Reed said To Reed, the answer is obvious: a long-term budget plan that makes some comparatively modest reforms to Obamacare in its first step, but keeps its focus on the bigger issues.\n\nWould such a plan fly in these times of divided government and polarized politics? Rep. Chris Collins, R-Clarence, isn\u2019t sure. \u201cCertainly it\u2019s an interesting concept,\u201d Collins said \u2013 while warning that frosty relations between the White House and Congress could stop it in its tracks.\n\n\u201cWhat you\u2019re really talking about is a grand bargain, and I don\u2019t think we\u2019re really ready there because I don\u2019t think the trust is really there,\u201d Collins said.\n\nNevertheless, Reed feels compelled to try, said Gardner, his partner in the effort.\n\n\u201cTom\u2019s a great leader,\u201d Gardner said. \u201cHe\u2019s somebody who isn\u2019t going to just sit back and watch as a train wreck unfolds; he\u2019s going to jump into the fray and fix it and provide leadership.\u201d\n\nemail: jzremski@buffnews.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Frustrated with the continuing impasse over the looming expiration of the debt ceiling and the ongoing government shutdown, Rep.
