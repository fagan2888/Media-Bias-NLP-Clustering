New lists were posted Monday.\n\nMany of the confiscations are done when police have only suspicion there might have been an offense. And there are complicated procedures to follow if the owners want to reclaim their assets, ranging from two rounds of ammunition worth 20 cents to piles of cash.\n\nAmong the seized assets documented in the new lists: The contents of a Chase bank account in Irving, Texas, that contained $39,000.90, meaning federal authorities have the money.\n\nThere also are nearly 100 iPhones worth nearly $30,000 formerly owned by a Mr. Li in Memphis, Texas.\n\nThen there is the \u201c$701 in U.S. currency valued at $701 seized on April 20, 2014 in West St. Paul, Minnesota\u201d from Terrell Williams.\n\nA Louis Vuitton purse, worth $2,730, was taken from Kafi Rahman Farrakhan in Puerto Rico, a $41,000 2014 Acura MDX was taken from Tawayne Palacol $206,801 in cash came from Tung Wing Ho.\n\nThe website has links to confiscated property lists for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, Drug Enforcement Administration, FBI, U.S. Attorney\u2019s office, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Post Inspection Service and the U.S. Secret Service.\n\n\u201cPolice State USA: How Orwell\u2019s Nightmare is Becoming Our Reality,\u201d marshals the terrifying evidence to show the world of Big Brother is much closer than we want to admit.\n\nChumley reports the ATF notification list spans 133 pages, including everything from an M3A1 submachine gun pistol valued at $500 and seized in mid-March in Grimesland, North Carolina, to an Israeli military UZI pistol, valued at $800 and seized April 29 in Yukon, Oklahoma.\n\nThe Drug Enforcement Administration has its own 131-page list that showcases seizures such as $7,522 in cash from a couple in Salem, Virginia, on April 17, and $30,000 in cash from a woman in San Diego on March 326.\n\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office and the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency have their own lists, too, spanning, in order, 57 pages, 737 pages and 816 pages. And so do the U.S. Postal Inspection Service and the U.S. Secret Service. The list for the former only goes on for 21 pages; for the latter, for 50.\n\n\u201cThe travesty about forfeitures is that the government can confiscate almost any item it deems to have been used during the commission of a crime \u2013 but in some cases, the crimes haven\u2019t even been fully vetted through court. That means forfeitures can suck up a lot of properties and cash belonging to innocent people,\u201d Chumley explained.\n\n\u201cThe system does allow for petitioners to get back properties and cash \u2013 but talk about an uphill climb. Having to prove one\u2019s self as innocent of a crime is a tough position to be in \u2013 and one that Founding Fathers decried as backward. Unfortunately, trying to reclaim forfeiture property makes a mockery of the American concept of innocent, until proven guilty,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cOn top of that, the means the government does give to try and win back forfeiture properties are convoluted, confusing and riddled with bureaucratic hoops,\u201d Chumley said.\n\nShe pointed to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms & Explosives notification list, which explains that \u201can owner or lien holder may file a petition for remission or mitigation of the forfeiture with ATF by sending a petition to the [ATF street address], pursuant to Title 19, U.S.C., Section 1618, and the regulations governing the petition process set forth in Title 28, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 9. \u2026 In addition to, or in lieu of petitioning for remission or mitigation, a person may contest the forfeiture of the seized property in UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT by filing a claim and cost bond with ATF within 20 days after the last publication date. \u2026 Upon the filing of a claim under Title 19, U.S.C., Section 1608 et seq., a cost bond must also be given to the United States in the penal sum of $5,000 or 10 percent of the value of the claimed property, whichever is lower, but not less than $250. \u2026 To be timely filed, a claim must be received by ATF on or before the filing deadline date. \u2026 Submissions by facsimile or other electronic means will not be accepted.\u201d\n\nShe asked how the average American citizen can understand that process\n\n\u201cIf the intent of the government is to suggest that citizens who may have been innocently swept up in the forfeiture process ought to just chalk up their properties as gone and forgotten \u2013 congratulations. Message received,\u201d she said.\n\nThe government site includes a listing for \u201c2 rounds Remington ammunition Cal:22\u201d which was valued at 20 cents. It was seized May 15, 2014, in Lincoln, Alabama.\n\nTaken in Holyoke, Massachusetts, from Javier Gonzales was a 1966 Chevrolet Chevelle valued at more than $44,000,\n\nThe FBI took custody of hundreds of Moneygrams worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, and $6,000 was confiscated from a backpack in the back seat of a 10-year-old Acura parked in Austin, Texas.\n\nA gold, two-tone, men\u2019s, 8.5 inch, multistrand, diamond- cut bead bracelet was confiscated from a Maryland owner.\n\nChumley\u2019s \u201cPolice State USA: How Orwell\u2019s Nightmare is Becoming Our Reality\u201d has received high praise from Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Texas.\n\nIn the foreword to Chumley\u2019s book, Gohmert writes:\n\nLook at what we know the government already has accessed. Under Obamacare, the federal government now gets complete documentation of your deepest, darkest, most personal secrets in your medical records that only your doctor once knew until the government decided to help you.\n\nYour revelations to your doctor were completely secret, and our courts used to protect that precious doctor-patient relationship with full-blown privacy rights. Now, without a single Republican vote, the Democrats in the House and Senate decided that those full-blown rights should be fully blown up because the omniscient, ubiquitous, all-knowing, all-caring federal government needs to be in full control of our lives.\n\nThose Democrats are hoping that the governmental god in whom they trust will be more trustworthy in controlling our lives than it is in controlling and operating a website,\u201d he said.\n\nThe coming signs of tyranny are all around us. Fortunately, they can be stopped before it is too late, but not without a courageous effort. This nation\u2019s founders risked absolutely everything to secure the blessings of freedom. We only risk some belittling by the mainstream and government harassment for preserving those freedoms. Bottom line, the data in Chumley\u2019s book concerns me and it should concern you.\n\nThe book describes the case of a former Marine living in Virginia.\n\nIt was August 2012, and he \u201cwas taken into custody, thrown in jail, and forcibly transferred to a hospital located nearly three hours from his home and family to undergo a psychiatric evaluation, all at the order of law enforcement officials.\u201d\n\n\u201cHis crime? He posted on his private Facebook page messages that painted the government in a poor light.\u201d\n\nThen there was the July 2013 case of a University of Virginia student. She was \u201cswarmed by state Alcoholic Beverage Control agents who thought the carton of bottled water she was carrying across the parking lot of a grocery store was really a 12-pack of beer and she was an underage buyer.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe said one drew her gun, another jumped on the hood of her SUV, and still others shouted conflicting orders and flashed badges she couldn\u2019t read. Terrified, she tried to flee in her SUV, but agents halted and arrested her, charging her with two counts of assault.\n\n\u201cEven the commonwealth\u2019s attorney who investigated the incident found the case ridiculous and refused to prosecute. But the 20-year-old still spent a night in jail \u2013 for the crime of purchasing water.\u201d\n\n\n\nMedia wishing to interview author Cheryl Chumley may contact media@wnd.com.\n\nSee a trailer:", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "Millions of dollars in folding cash, exotic cars, gold jewelry, rare weapons and even boxes of iPhones are being offered by the government back to their owners, if they can prove their innocence.
