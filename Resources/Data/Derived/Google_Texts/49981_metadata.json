I thank the men and women of the Lakewood Police Department, Des Moines Police Department, Spokane Police Department, Spokane County Sheriff's Office, the State Patrol, U.S. Marshals and others who acted swiftly to capture Anthony Garver and Mark Alexander Adams.\n\n\"This incident put the public at risk, the staff at risk and the patients at risk. Legislators and I have been working together to provide much-needed resources and staffing to bolster the hospital's abilities to treat patients in a safe and timely manner. But this raises serious questions once again about the management and operation of this troubled hospital.\n\n\"I expect Western's management and DSHS to work swiftly to determine how this happened and what needs to be done so it doesn't happen again. DSHS leadership\u2019s decisions to temporarily revoke all off-site privileges and to deploy additional security are good first steps. But much work remains and I expect swift action.\u201d\n\n", "article_metadata": {"generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.governor.wa.gov/news-media/inslee-statement-regarding-recovery-two-western-state-hospital-patients", "title": "Inslee statement regarding recovery of two Western State Hospital patients", "site": {"identifier": "@GovInslee", "id": 1077214808}, "card": "summary", "creator": {"identifier": "@wastategov", "id": 1009489969}}, "google-translate-customization": "d7f618b6b2409454-2cd07b6e85f71c87-g0a19df6dfd60df65-13", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "apple-touch-fullscreen": "YES", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "I thank the men and women of the Lakewood Police Department, Des Moines Police Department, Spokane Police Department, Spokane County Sheriff's Office, the State Patrol, U.S.\n\"The safe recovery of both patients who eloped from Western State Hospital is welcome news.\n\"This incident put the public at risk, the staff at risk and the patients at risk.\n\"I expect Western's management and DSHS to work swiftly to determine how this happened and what needs to be done so it doesn't happen again.\nBut this raises serious questions once again about the management and operation of this troubled hospital."}
