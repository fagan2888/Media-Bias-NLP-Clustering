The Broncos and Seahawks cleared the field and returned around 8:20 p.m., then had a mandatory 10-minute warm-up period. The game restarted at 8:30 p.m. The delay ultimately lasted 45 minutes.\n\nThe last lightning delay here was in the regular-season opener last year against the Baltimore Ravens. It lasted 33 minutes.\n\nIf the game felt long, it\u2019s because it was. In all, it lasted 3 hours, 47 minutes, the second longest preseason game in Denver Broncos history. The longest was a 3:58 game against Dallas on Aug. 26, 1989.\n\nOnce a game is postponed, officials inside the operations center ask the meteorologist for an estimated duration of a game delay based on the forecasts, which is then sent to officials at the stadium, including the referee.\n\nOnly NFL commissioner Roger Goodell \u2014 or someone he designates \u2014 has the authority to actually \u201ccancel, postpone, alter the normal timing of, or terminate games, including games affected by inclement weather,\u201d according to NFL rules. If weather actually is bad enough, and the referee hasn\u2019t called the game (usually because officials in skyboxes can see developing weather easier than on-field officials), then the Game Day Operations Center has the authority to intervene and postpone a game.\n\nFans haven\u2019t been asked to leave or seek shelter, but are encouraged to if \u201cthey feel it\u2019s necessary.\u201d Many people in the highest places at Sports Authority Field at Mile High \u2014 I\u2019m looking at Section 535 and 536 \u2014 seem perfectly content to wait this out.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Baltimore Ravens,Denver Broncos,Lightning Delays,Roger Goodell,Seattle Seahawks,Severe Weather,Sports Authority Field at Mile High", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "First-and-Orange", "description": "The Denver Broncos and Seattle Seahawks game went through lightning delays late in the first quarter and was postponed while severe weather moved through.", "title": "Lightning delays NFL rules: Broncos-Seahawks postponed in 1st quarter", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2014/08/07/lightning-delays-nfl-rules-broncos-seahawks-game-1st-quarter-postponement/28608/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/files/2014/08/broncos-seahawks-preseason-lightning-delay.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "The Denver Broncos and Seattle Seahawks game went through lightning delays late in the first quarter and was postponed while severe weather moved through.", "title": "Lightning delays Broncos-Seahawks game late in first quarter", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2014/08/07/lightning-delays-nfl-rules-broncos-seahawks-game-1st-quarter-postponement/28608/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/files/2014/08/broncos-seahawks-preseason-lightning-delay.jpg", "creator": "@danielpetty", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "language": "en, sv", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "The Denver Broncos and Seattle Seahawks game went through lightning delays late in the first quarter and was postponed while severe weather moved through."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce631\"", "article_summary": "In all, it lasted 3 hours, 47 minutes, the second longest preseason game in Denver Broncos history.\nLeague officials called the Denver Broncos-Seattle Seahawks preseason game with 1:30 left in the first quarter because of severe weather within the eight-mile limit of Sports Authority Field at Mile High.\nThe Broncos and Seahawks cleared the field and returned around 8:20 p.m., then had a mandatory 10-minute warm-up period.\nOnce a game is postponed, officials inside the operations center ask the meteorologist for an estimated duration of a game delay based on the forecasts, which is then sent to officials at the stadium, including the referee.\nThe last lightning delay here was in the regular-season opener last year against the Baltimore Ravens."}
