Of those, 250 were filed for foreign fashion models, according to a Reuters analysis of federal Department of Labor data.\n\nPalmer attorney Gehi will appear on Friday, along with immigration experts, at a news conference at the National Press Club in Washington to discuss the case with reporters.\n\n(Reporting By Michelle Conlin; Editing by Jonathan Oatis)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - A Jamaican fashion model who alleges that Republican presidential", "title": "Model who alleges Trump's agency defrauded her moving forward with case", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/07/Model-who-alleges-Trumps-agency-defrauded-her-moving-forward-case", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-election-trump_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/07/Model-who-alleges-Trumps-agency-defrauded-her-moving-forward-case", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-election-trump_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - A Jamaican fashion model who alleges that Republican presidential", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf6f4\"", "article_summary": "\"Trump Model has been in full compliance, and should fare well in any investigation or audit.\"\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - A Jamaican fashion model who alleges that Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump's modeling agency defrauded her of $225,000 in pay is moving forward with her case, despite a federal judge's decision to dismiss the lawsuit.\nPalmer accused Trump Model Management LLC of lying to the federal government in its work-visa application that she would be paid a $75,000-a-year salary while living in the United States, court documents show.\nIn August, Reuters reported that Trump's companies had sought to import at least 1,100 workers on temporary visas since 2000.\nTrump\u2019s lawyers have blasted the case as \"frivolous\" and without merit."}
