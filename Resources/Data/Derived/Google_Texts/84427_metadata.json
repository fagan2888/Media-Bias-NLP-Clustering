It is also one that would be severely harmed by the proposals Obama laid out this week in his State of the Union agenda to raise capital gains tax rates on risk-taking investors.\n\nWhile Clinton didn\u2019t directly criticize Obama\u2019s economic policies, she pointed to part of our economy that has long been the largest source of new jobs: entrepreneurial start-up ventures that become job-creating, income-producing behemoths.\n\nBut sadly, she added, this pivotal sector of the economy has slowed down to the point where it is undermining new job production across the country.\n\nIn a speech to Canadian business and civic leaders, paid for by the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, she said the so-called economic recovery hasn\u2019t helped anywhere near enough small- to medium-size businesses, or boosted entrepreneurs \u2014 the people who create most of the jobs in our country.\n\nShe specifically pointed to \u201cthe slow rate of small- and medium-sized business formation,\u201d suggesting the slowdown is the chief reason why we still suffer from weak job growth and stagnant middle-class incomes.\n\n\u201cOur economy, historically, and job creation, has been driven by small- and medium-sized businesses,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re just not seeing that start up again.\u201d\n\nSince stepping down from her checkered performance as Obama\u2019s secretary of State, Clinton has been devoting herself to the speaking circuit, raking in millions of dollars by charging $300,000 a pop for her thoughts about what\u2019s wrong in our country. And she is testing the waters for a likely run for the presidency.\n\nYet, incredibly, she hasn\u2019t had anything of substance to say about the Obama economy, at least until now.\n\nIt\u2019s not as if she thinks this isn\u2019t an issue people care much about. The polls tell her it is. So do the Wall Street, banking and big-business audiences she appears before.\n\nBut she didn\u2019t want to be seen as a critic of Obama\u2019s policies that both she and her husband, Bill Clinton, who is her chief political adviser, believe have hurt the economy and their party, too.\n\nHer remarks Wednesday at a business conference in Winnipeg, Manitoba, were her first tentative steps into the politically sensitive terrain about what contributes to a job-building economy.\n\nYou have to search hard to find terms like \u201cbusiness start-ups,\u201d \u201crisk capital investment\u201d and \u201centrepreneurship\u201d in any of Obama\u2019s speeches. These aren\u2019t in his vocabulary, and not something most Democrats want to hear.\n\nBut Clinton\u2019s speech had all the earmarks of her husband\u2019s advice about a subject he knows well: capital gains tax rates, which he once embraced as the key to a stronger, job-creating economy.\n\nBill Clinton entered the White House in 1993 on an agenda to raise taxes on upper-income Americans, raising the top rate to nearly 40 percent.\n\nBut it didn\u2019t bring in the significantly higher revenue that he and his advisers expected as the economy began coming out of a short and shallow recession, growing at modest rates throughout his first term.\n\nThen in his second term, the Republican-run Congress sent him a deficit-cutting bill in 1997 that he signed. One of its key provisions slashed the capital gains tax rate from 28 percent to 20 percent.\n\nThe lower rate dramatically unlocked billions of dollars in capital investment that tripled in 1998 and then doubled again in 1999 \u2014 pouring into high-tech start-ups, swelling job creation and cutting the unemployment rate to 4 percent.\n\n\u201cIncentives are what matter,\u201d said economic analyst Brian S. Wesbury in a 2003 analysis of the Clinton tax cuts. The capital gains cuts \u201cmeant that the after-tax return from a $100 capital gain\u201d resulted in \u201can 11 percent increase.\u201d\n\nObama sees the capital gains tax on stock dividends as a giveaway to upper-income investors, with little return to the economy, robbing needed tax revenue from the U.S. Treasury.\n\nThe issue came up during a 2008 presidential debate, when Obama said he opposed the then-lower 15 percent capital gains tax rate that Congress passed in 2003 under the Bush administration. The government, he said, could not afford to give tax breaks to the wealthy at a time of rising budget deficits and would lose revenue in the deal.\n\nBut then-ABC News anchor Charlie Gibson, who was moderating the debate, reminded Obama that capital gains tax cuts always brought in more revenue as investors took full advantage of the lower rate and to sell stocks, plowing the earnings into new start-ups that yielded a higher return on their investment.\n\nThat, of course, is what happened under the GOP tax cuts Clinton signed. But Obama remains ignorant of the double return the government gets on cutting capital gains rates: more start-up businesses, higher employment numbers and a lot more money flowing into the Treasury, which lowers the deficit.\n\nObama said this week that he wants Congress to raise the capital gains tax back up to 28 percent for couples with joint incomes exceeding $500,000 \u2014 an act that would worsen the economic problems Hillary talked about in Canada.\n\nFortunately, the new Republican Congress isn\u2019t going to send Obama the capital gains tax hike he wants \u2014 or his other tax increases, either.\n\nBut Clinton isn\u2019t saying much more beyond the concerns she expressed about the lack of new business formation \u2014 at least not yet.\n\nThe tax cuts needed to escalate the number of start-up firms await the GOP\u2019s 2016 presidential nominee, who will remind voters of a former Democratic candidate who ran on cutting taxes in 1960 to get \u201cAmerica moving again.\u201d\n\nWhen the lefties in John F. Kennedy\u2019s party criticized his across-the-board income tax cuts, saying they would benefit only the rich, he correctly replied, \u201cA rising tide lifts all boats.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Human Events", "description": "Hillary Clinton talked about job creation this week, raising an issue that has been one of President Obama's biggest economic shortcomings.", "title": "Obama hasn't learned the lesson of capital gains tax cuts | Human Events", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://humanevents.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/2015_01_23_011031_30-480x314.jpg", "url": "http://humanevents.com/2015/01/23/obama-hasnt-learned-the-lesson-of-capital-gains-tax-cuts/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"pages": 212436860202}, "description": "Hillary Clinton talked about job creation this week, raising an issue that has been one of President Obama's biggest economic shortcomings.", "twitter": {"image": "http://humanevents.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/2015_01_23_011031_30-480x314.jpg", "site": "@humanevents", "card": "summary", "description": "Hillary Clinton talked about job creation this week, raising an issue that has been one of President Obama's biggest economic shortcomings."}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd015b\"", "article_summary": "Fortunately, the new Republican Congress isn\u2019t going to send Obama the capital gains tax hike he wants \u2014 or his other tax increases, either.\nOne of its key provisions slashed the capital gains tax rate from 28 percent to 20 percent.\n\u201cIncentives are what matter,\u201d said economic analyst Brian S.
