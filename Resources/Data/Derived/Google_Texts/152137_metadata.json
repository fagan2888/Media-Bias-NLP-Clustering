One of them will face Democrat William Moody in the general election.\n\n\n\nThree other incumbents on the state high court up for reelection are Jeff Brown, Jeff Boyd and Phil Johnson. Only Brown faces a primary opponent, Republican Joe Pool. Boyd and Johnson will have Democrat opponents in the fall.\n\n\n\nCloser to home, several district judgeships in Jefferson County are on the ballots. Newly sworn-in Leanne Johnson will face Earl B. Stover III in the Republican Primary as candidate for the Ninth District Court of Appeals in Beaumont.\n\n\n\nThe 252nd District Court, which handles predominantly criminal cases, is wide open with the stepping down of Judge Layne Walker at the beginning of the year. Applying for the spot are Republican Carolyn Drawhorn Weidenfeld, and local attorneys Stella Morrison and Raquel West are facing each other in the Democratic Primary.\n\n\n\n58th District Court Judge Bob Wortham has thrown his hat in the ring to become the next Jefferson County Criminal District Attorney. The Democrat will face assistant prosecutor Perry Thomas, a Republican in the general election.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOFFICES ON THE BALLOTS\n\n\n\nFederal Offices\n\n\n\nU.S. Senator\n\n\n\nKen Cope-R\n\n\n\nChris Mapp-R\n\n\n\nJohn Cornyn-R\n\n\n\nCurt Cleaver-R\n\n\n\nLinda Vega-R\n\n\n\nDwayne Stovall-R\n\n\n\nSteve Stockman-R\n\n\n\nReid Reasor-R\n\n\n\nHarry Kim-D\n\n\n\nKesha Rogers-D\n\n\n\nDavid M.
