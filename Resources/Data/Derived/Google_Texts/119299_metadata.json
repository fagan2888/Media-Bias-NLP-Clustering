This is something you already know if you're old enough to have made the rounds of doctors' offices trying to address all the different but somehow connected ways your body is managing to let you down.\n\n\"We call these multiple chronic conditions,\" says Caroline S. Blaum, director of geriatric medicine and palliative care at the New York University School of Medicine. \"But if you're a patient, it feels like one thing.\"\n\nThe first summit, a year and a half ago in Washington, D.C., was a sort of public debut for the \"geroscience hypothesis:\" that by focusing on the aging process itself, scientists can find ways to blunt the miseries of age-related chronic illnesses. So for this second summit, the participants are looking at three specific disease categories -- cancer, diabetes and HIV -- searching for commonalities while realizing that the relationships between them are complicated and involve a lot of unknowns.\n\nFelipe Sierra, director of the National Institute on Aging's Division of Aging Biology and founder of the National Institutes of Health interest group that jumpstarted this ambitious conversation, lays out the geroscience hypothesis in simple terms: \"If we were to attack aging, we would be reducing the impact of all the diseases. The question always comes, Can we do it? In humans, we don\u2019t know, of course. But at least in mice, we know that dietary restriction, for example, reduces the process of aging.\"\n\nLike most academic meetings, this one gives rise to more intriguing questions than solid answers. Why and how does chemotherapy for cancer patients accelerate the process of aging? What are the possible downsides of drugs known to extend the \"healthspan\" -- not just longer life, but symptom-free life -- in lab animals, such as rapamycin and the diabetes drug metformin? What can we learn from the experience of people living with HIV, whose bodies respond in dire ways to their necessary treatment regimens?\n\nAnd uppermost, the chicken-and-egg question: Does aging make us vulnerable to these diseases, or do the disorders themselves accelerate aging? The answer, at this point, is looking like yes and yes.\n\n\"It makes it very complicated but very exciting at the same time, because everything is interconnected,\" Sierra says. \"What happens with age is you don\u2019t get one disease; you get three or four or five. We need to re-examine the 'war on disease' approach. We have been doing that for a long time; it worked very well for infectious diseases. But for these complex, chronic diseases, it's not likely to produce as much as a holistic approach.\"\n\nFollow Barbara Peters Smith on Twitter @BarbaraPSmith.", "article_metadata": {"wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe3da5\"", "article_summary": "But for these complex, chronic diseases, it's not likely to produce as much as a holistic approach.\"\nAnd uppermost, the chicken-and-egg question: Does aging make us vulnerable to these diseases, or do the disorders themselves accelerate aging?\nBut at least in mice, we know that dietary restriction, for example, reduces the process of aging.\"\nWhy and how does chemotherapy for cancer patients accelerate the process of aging?\n\"We call these multiple chronic conditions,\" says Caroline S.
