Motl, a highly-trained physicist, then contrasted that with how \u201c95% certain\u201d findings are more sensibly applied in particle physics.\n\nI just came across his post now, and was struck most to learn how, in the world of particle physics, a 95% confidence level is \u201cincredibly low,\u201d Motl writes:\n\nAs I said, the 95% confidence level is known as the 2-sigma confidence in hard sciences such as particle physics. Particle physics experiments have brought us hundreds of 2-sigma excesses \u2013 and lots of much larger (more confident) excesses \u2013 and a vast majority of them turned out to be flukes. When more data were accumulated, these excesses just went away. Such things inevitably occur all the time. Because people keep on looking for new effects, they inevitably encounter flukes that look like a new effect but the effect actually doesn\u2019t exist. A priori, a new effect is always a pretty unlikely thing so if you look at the history of particle physics, most of the 2-sigma deviations were really flukes \u2013 results of coincidences that shouldn\u2019t have been paid any attention to.\n\nOne important distinction Motl identifies before making this analogy is that 95% confidence levels in particle physics are calculated differently than how the IPCC calculates their confidence level, namely, the IPCC does no calculating at all, in fact they come up with their percentage level through a voting process.\n\nOf course, failure to calculate a credible percentage figure is not entirely the IPCC\u2019s fault, the enormous complexity of climate science stands in the way of allowing any person or group of persons to simply collect concrete data and then plug them into a clearly-defined calculation to be done by a computer. So they have a pretty good excuse one could say, but it\u2019s still just an excuse, and science doesn\u2019t recognize excuses, even if politics might.\n\n(Photo credit: Oregon State University)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://blog.heartland.org/2013/12/contrasting-95-confident-levels-in-particle-physics-with-climate-science/", "site_name": "Somewhat Reasonable", "image": "http://blog.heartland.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/normal_sigma_21.png", "type": "activity", "title": "Contrasting \u201895% Confident\u2019 Levels in Particle Physics with Climate Science"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf50b\"", "article_summary": "Motl, a highly-trained physicist, then contrasted that with how \u201c95% certain\u201d findings are more sensibly applied in particle physics.\nI just came across his post now, and was struck most to learn how, in the world of particle physics, a 95% confidence level is \u201cincredibly low,\u201d Motl writes:As I said, the 95% confidence level is known as the 2-sigma confidence in hard sciences such as particle physics.\nParticle physics experiments have brought us hundreds of 2-sigma excesses \u2013 and lots of much larger (more confident) excesses \u2013 and a vast majority of them turned out to be flukes.\nOne important distinction Motl identifies before making this analogy is that 95% confidence levels in particle physics are calculated differently than how the IPCC calculates their confidence level, namely, the IPCC does no calculating at all, in fact they come up with their percentage level through a voting process.\nSo they have a pretty good excuse one could say, but it\u2019s still just an excuse, and science doesn\u2019t recognize excuses, even if politics might."}
