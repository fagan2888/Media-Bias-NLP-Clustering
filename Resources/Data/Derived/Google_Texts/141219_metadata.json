They predict that global average temperature will be increasing at a rate of 0.25 C\u00b0 per decade by 2020. That rate of change would be \u201cunprecedented for at least the past 1,000 years.\u201d If average global temperature began to rise at this rate, it would vindicate the climate models. If not, then what?\n\nThe prognosticated warm up has not yet started. As I noted earlier the private research group Remote Sensing Systems has pointed out that the climate models are all running too hot for most of the earth. As RSS reported:\n\n\u201cClimate models cannot explain this warming if human-caused increases in greenhouse gases are not included as input to the model simulation.\u201d But the folks at RSS significantly further note, \u201cThe troposphere has not (emphasis RSS) warmed as fast as almost all climate models predict.\u201d\n\nThe good news is that the authors have made a falsifiable prediction to which we can know the answer in five years or so.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Global warming to speed up by 2020", "title": "New Climate Model Simulations Project Global Warming At Rates Unprecedented For At Least the Past 1,000 Years by 2020", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2015/03/09/new-climate-model-simulations-project-gl", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14259280538187.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@reason", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14259280538187.jpg", "description": "Global warming to speed up by 2020", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "New Climate Model Simulations Project Global Warming At Rates Unprecedented For At Least the Past 1,000 Years by 2020"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "Computer Simulation", "published_time": "2015-03-09T21:03:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/ronald-bailey"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "article_summary": "They predict that global average temperature will be increasing at a rate of 0.25 C\u00b0 per decade by 2020.\nThat rate of change would be \u201cunprecedented for at least the past 1,000 years.\u201d If average global temperature began to rise at this rate, it would vindicate the climate models.\nResearchers from the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory published an article, \"Near-term acceleration in the rate of temperature change,\" in Nature Climate Change today in which they compared past rates of temperature change over 40-year periods with future projections.\nAs I noted earlier the private research group Remote Sensing Systems has pointed out that the climate models are all running too hot for most of the earth.\nThe prognosticated warm up has not yet started."}
