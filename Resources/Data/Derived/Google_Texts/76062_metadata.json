The ACOs, created under the Affordable Care Act in 2010, aim to better coordinate patient care while encouraging providers to lower health care costs by allowing them to share in savings.\n\nPatients in a Medicare ACO can go elsewhere for care, yet their ACOs are financially responsible for services provided and could face consequences of bad outcomes, a possible flaw in the ACO structure.\n\n\u201cWhile there's tremendous opportunity in really delivering better health care, higher-quality, lower-cost health care, there's not an impetus on the part of the consumer in many cases to really participate,\u201d said Steve Lefar, CEO of Skokie-based health care analytics and consultancy Sg2 LLC.\n\nIllinois Health Partners ACO LLC is one of 123 new ACOs nationwide announced this month by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nIllinois Health Partners' experience and existing infrastructure, such as a common electronic health record, give the new ACO an advantage, said Mike Kasper, CEO of Downers Grove-based DuPage Medical, one of the largest physicians groups in the Chicago area with $415 million in 2012 net revenue.\n\n\u201cWe think we're uniquely positioned,\u201d Mr. Kasper said.\n\nHe added that the shared savings model isn't as financially risky as another Medicare model, the Pioneer ACO.\n\nIn July, CMS said just 13 of 32 Pioneer ACOs generated shared savings with the federal agency. But collectively those ACOs saved nearly $33 million by lowering health care expenses in part by reducing hospital admissions and readmissions.\n\nYet nine health care providers reportedly planned to drop out of the Pioneer program, raising questions about the attractiveness of the initiative to doctors and hospitals.\n\nIn Harvey, the Ingalls ACO is only taking on about 6,100 Medicare beneficiaries as the hospital seeks to adapt to an environment in which hospitals are being rewarded for quality over quantity of services provided.\n\n\u201cHealth care is changing, and it really is moving toward population health management, what ACOs do,\u201d said Lynn Philipson, executive director of the ACO, Ingalls Care Network LLC, as well as director of managed care for Ingalls Health System, which had $355 million in 2012 revenue. \u201cSo we felt that we wanted to get more into developing population health management here at Ingalls, and having a specific population to start with is very helpful when you're building those systems and competencies.\u201d\n\nMore than half of the new ACOs are physician-led organizations that serve fewer than 10,000 beneficiaries, CMS said in a news release.\n\nDr. Rustom, a south suburban internist, is leading Primary Comprehensive Care ACO LLC, a consortium of independent physicians whom he recruited.\n\nThe ACO would manage about 5,600 Medicare beneficiaries, said Gary Albers, chief operating officer of Louisville, Ky.-based Imperium Health Management LLC, which manages the venture.\n\n\u201cPart of what is very important to the inner workings of an ACO is to move patients away from the expensive side of services and into the outpatient setting,\u201d Mr. Albers said. \u201cSo it fit hand-in-hand with what Dr. Rustom has done historically.\u201d\n\nIn October, the Illinois board that regulates health care projects approved a plan by Dr. Rustom to open an outpatient surgery center in south suburban Orland Park. Dr. Rustom initially said the facility would be the first outpatient surgery center in the state to follow Islamic law but later amended his proposal to drop religious references.\n\nHe did not return a call to comment.\n\nMore than 360 Medicare ACOs have launched nationwide since the program began in 2012, covering more than 5.3 million people nationwide. The groups must meet 33 quality measures related to care coordination and patient safety, among others metrics, and share with Medicare any savings achieved from cutting health care costs by meeting those standards.\n\nJanesville, Wis.-based Mercy Health System ACO plans to serve beneficiaries in Illinois and Wisconsin, while St. Louis-based SSM ACO LLC plans to serve those in Illinois and Missouri.\n\nThe new ACOs begin on Jan. 1.", "article_metadata": {"byline": "Kristen Schorsch", "timeCrawled": "20160525_09:28:33", "categoryName": "CCB - Health Care", "published_at": "2013-12-26", "title": "Medicare taps DuPage-Edward venture to manage patients, find savings", "taxo_Industries": "Hospitals", "twitter": {"image": "http://www.chicagobusiness.com/images/logo-square-200x200.png", "site": "@CrainsChicago", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Medicare taps DuPage-Edward venture to manage patients, find savings"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#2d89ef", "og": {"site_name": "Crain's Chicago Business", "description": "The federal government has tapped an organization backed by DuPage Medical Group and Edward Hospital to manage the health of about 50,000 Medicare beneficiaries under an arrangement designed to create incentives to cut costs.", "title": "Medicare taps DuPage-Edward venture to manage patients, find savings", "url": "http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20131226/NEWS03/131229928/medicare-taps-dupage-edward-venture-to-manage-patients-find-savings", "image": "http://www.chicagobusiness.com/images/logo-square-200x200.png", "type": "article"}, "summary": "The federal government has tapped an organization backed by DuPage Medical Group and Edward Hospital to manage the health of about 50,000 Medicare beneficiaries under an arrangement designed to create incentives to cut costs.", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=571426684", "fb": {"admins": 100001125868754}, "url": "http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article//NEWS03/131229928", "msapplication-TileImage": "/assets/icons/mstile-144x144.png", "content_type": "article", "taxo_Companies": "Humana Inc.", "google-site-verification": "0QcjJi4OGS9bKu4FBKK58V93fKv0WYCQb7IFbmjATew", "taxo_Areas": "Chicago suburbs", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimal-ui", "description": "Visit Crain's Chicago Business for complete business news and analysis including healthcare, real estate, manufacturing, government, sports and more."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf6fe\"", "article_summary": "In the fragmented health care system, patients can often see multiple doctors, each with their own set of records and sometimes differing views on appropriate care.\nMore than 360 Medicare ACOs have launched nationwide since the program began in 2012, covering more than 5.3 million people nationwide.\nDr. Rustom, a south suburban internist, is leading Primary Comprehensive Care ACO LLC, a consortium of independent physicians whom he recruited.\n\u201cWhile there's tremendous opportunity in really delivering better health care, higher-quality, lower-cost health care, there's not an impetus on the part of the consumer in many cases to really participate,\u201d said Steve Lefar, CEO of Skokie-based health care analytics and consultancy Sg2 LLC.\nYet nine health care providers reportedly planned to drop out of the Pioneer program, raising questions about the attractiveness of the initiative to doctors and hospitals."}
