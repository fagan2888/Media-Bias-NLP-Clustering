Instead, these reports rely on stereotypes of hacker to disregard the importance of his message.\n\nA teenager hacked into the personal AOL account of CIA director John Brennan. The teen, who remains anonymous, explicitly informed multiple media outlets he committed the act to \u201cfree Palestine\u201d or call attention to the issue of violence against Palestinians. Some documents from Brennan\u2019s account have been published by WikiLeaks.\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\nThe omission quite deliberately mutes the political agency of the teenager. It enables media outlets to cover the hack as a straightforward, malicious criminal hack instead of one inspired by an activist-minded impulse.\n\nThe New York Post interviewed the high school student, who claimed to hack into Brennan\u2019s AOL account with the help of a group he called \u201cCrackas With Attitude.\u201d He told the Post over a \u201cseries of phone conversations\u201d he was \u201cmotivated by opposition to U.S. foreign policy and support for Palestine.\u201d\n\nThe teen also spoke to The Daily Dot and stated, \u201cWe aren\u2019t doing this for personal gain. It\u2019s for Free Palestine and Free Gaza.\u201d\n\nWired reported the teen and his group called Brennan\u2019s mobile phone number using VoIP to tell him he had been hacked.\n\n\u201c[I]t was like \u2018Hey,\u2026. its CWA.\u2019 He was like \u2018What do you want?\u2019 We said \u20182 trillion dollars hahhaa, just joking,\u2019\u201d the hacker recounted to WIRED. Brennan, the hacker says, replied, \u201cHow much do you really want?\u201d They told Brennan \u201cWe just want Palestine to be free and for you to stop killing innocent people.\u201d\n\nThe teenager and his group used social engineering techniques to successfully obtain access to Brennan\u2019s account. They impersonated a Verizon technician, claimed Brennan couldn\u2019t access Verizon\u2019s customer database because \u201ctools were down,\u201d and asked Verizon to lookup details for Brennan\u2019s account. They provided a fabricated employee code and obtained the information. After that, they had the personal identifying information necessary to reset his AOL password and get into his account.\n\nNew York Daily News, CNN, and other outlets reported the teenager is a white boy. He likes to \u201csmoke pot,\u201d and the boy and his group were high when hacking into Brennan\u2019s email account. This gave the teen the stoned hacker persona, which has largely defined how reporters cover the hack.\n\nBut viewing the act as the malice of a stoned hacker distracts from the fact that the hack may be best understood as disruptive activism. Although the hack involved breaking the law, it had political aims. However, most journalists have firmly held viewpoints about hackers, which get in the way of reasonably discussing motives.\n\nThe \u2018central deviant of the information society\u2019\n\nAuthor Molly Sauter explores characterizations of hackers in her book, \u201cThe Coming Swarm: DDOS Actions, Hacktivism, and Civil Disobedience on the Internet.\u201d She highlights the \u201cmedia\u2019s use of the stereotypical hacker figure to promote a social fear of technology and pervasive environment of technoparanoia.\u201d\n\nHacker is a catch-all term. It means any type of \u201cbad\u201d or criminal computer activity. The hacker is a male \u201cfolk devil,\u201d the \u201cpersonification of our anxieties about technology.\u201d He is the \u201ccentral deviant of the information society.\u201d His life, as in this case, is \u201csocially, economically, and often physically isolated.\u201d\n\n\u201cSee, for example, the stereotypic image of the adolescent hacker living in his parents\u2019 basement,\u201d Sauter writes. \u201cBecause he is socially alienated, he lacks the normal social checks on his behavior, and is instead engaged in compulsive, competitive cycles with other hackers, who egg on each other\u2019s antisocial behavior. He doesn\u2019t abide by conventional morality because he is immature or young. His relationship with technology is pathological, and he is sometimes described as being \u2018addicted\u2019 to computers or the internet.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, Sauter adds, \u201cThe hacker is locationless and decentralized, able to cause harm far from his actual location. The hacker folk devil is therefore cast as abnormal, alienated from conventional socials morals, a predictably bad actor, capable and willing to cause great harm to individuals, corporations, and the state. Not only is the hacker tarred with this brush, but anyone who participates in activities or holds views associated with hackers are held guilty by association.\u201d\n\nThis attitude is apparent in reports on the teenager involved in the hack of Brennan\u2019s AOL account, and this attitude conditions reporters to not care about asking follow-up questions about his political motivations. For example, why did the teenager and his group choose Brennan? How do they see him playing an integral role in U.S. support for the occupation of Palestine? What do they believe the CIA is doing in Palestine and what did they hope to find by hacking into the CIA director\u2019s private AOL account?\n\nThese are legitimate questions because the answers potentially explain the acts of rebellion and how thought-out or sophisticated the plans were.\n\nQuestions can be asked without condoning the act itself and would enable a discussion of whether a person\u2019s private accounts are off-limits to hacktivism directed at an official engaged in criminal misconduct or the concealing of the truth.\n\nIn this case, the perceived misconduct is related to Palestine, but it could also include Brennan\u2019s role in the expansion of the U.S. program of targeted assassinations in countries abroad.\n\nAdditionally, when WikiLeaks made the announcement through the organization\u2019s Twitter feed that it had obtained Brennan\u2019s emails, thousands of people paid attention and numerous outlets were prepared to cover revelations. It was presumed there would be significant revelations stemming from information that Brennan preferred to keep hidden from the public. So, the teen had reason to believe the hack would expose wrongdoing.\n\nHacktivism and American civil disobedience\n\nAt least one establishment pundit recognized the political nature of the hack. However, Politico\u2019s Michael Crowley quite shallowly lumped the hack in with past activism by the peace group, CODEPINK. Crowley adopted an authoritarian premise, which unidentified \u201cfriends and associates\u201d of Brennan do not even support, that Brennan has been a target of activism which has inappropriately and unjustly robbed him of his privacy.\n\n\u201cSenior leaders in government expect to be in the public eye and to be held accountable for the work they do,\u201d said one official familiar with the hacking episode. \u201cThat comes with the territory and they readily accept the scrutiny. We understand there people who are not fans of the CIA and there is nothing wrong with speaking out against CIA or the U.S. government writ large.\u201d\n\nThis person granted anonymity to pontificate to Crowley continued:\n\nBut illegally accessing a family email account and distributing to the world the private information of family members and other private citizens is outrageous \u2026 That\u2019s not a lawful protest, but criminal activity that impacts a great many people with no affiliation with CIA. Our country needs the best and brightest in public service, yet this episode may strike some as evidence that the price of government service is too high.\n\nWhile a bit melodramatic, the official appropriately differentiates CODEPINK activism, where CODEPINK went to Brennan\u2019s home to confront him, and the act of hacking a private email account of an official. The unidentified official does not state that hacking an email account is not a political act but does make clear it is not a \u201clawful protest\u201d but \u201ccriminal activity.\u201d\n\nThe United States has a rich history of protest, where individuals dissenting against the state engaged in conduct, like sit-ins, draft-card burnings, or breaking into an FBI office to reveal domestic spying, which violated laws or were deemed illegal by government officials.\n\nWith the rise of hacktivism, largely brought about by Anonymous, the hacking of a personal AOL account cannot simply be written off as a criminal act. Its political nature should be confronted not because it should be socially acceptable to violate the private accounts of government officials. Rather, the public should understand these actions are the efforts of individuals, who feel they have no other choice but to wield this power in order to call attention to violence and other critical issues.", "article_metadata": {"description": "With the rise of hacktivism, largely brought about by Anonymous, the hacking of a personal AOL account cannot simply be written off as a criminal act.
