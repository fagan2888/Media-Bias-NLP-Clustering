Denver police are investigating whether a shooting Friday night is linked to a string of gang-related shootings that have left a dozen people dead since the beginning of the year.

A 32-year-old man was hospitalized with a leg wound that was not considered life-threatening. His name has not been released.

“We’re obviously looking at whether this shooting is gang-related,” said Denver police spokesman Sonny Jackson. “We don’t know if this is an isolated shooting or not. We are investigating.”

No arrests have been made in the shooting, which happened near East 23rd Avenue and Oneida Street after an argument between the victim and several other men broke out about 9:30 p.m.

During the conflict, someone pulled out a gun and shot the man in the leg. The shooter and several others fled in a vehicle.

Police do not yet have a good description of the car, Jackson said.

Two people have been killed and four others have been seriously injured with gunshot wounds since April 25.

On April 25, 22-year-old Nolan Ware was fatally shot outside Denver Gospel Hall, the same day as a planned funeral for his great-uncle Abdul Rahim Muhammad, 61, who was killed two weeks earlier in his yard in the 1600 block of Bruce Randolph Avenue.

On Tuesday night, 26-year-old Dominique Perez was fatally shot and a second person was critically injured near East 35th Avenue and Williams Street.
