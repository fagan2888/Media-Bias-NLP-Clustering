Palamon Capital Struts into Luxury with Il Bisonte Acquisition

The owner of Waterford china, as well as Net-a-Porter, have been recent targets in the luxury market

Palamon Capital Partners has invested in Italian luxury leather brand Il Bisonte.

Il Bistone, headquartered in Florence, makes hand-crafted luxury leather handbags and accessories. The company operates in Europe, the U.S. and Asia, and sells through branded stores and department stores. Terms of the deal weren't disclosed.

London-based Palamon plans to expand Il Bisonte geographically. The private equity firm has previously invested in dress-for-less, a German online retailer, and feelunique.com, an online beauty products retailer.

The high-end goods market has attracted dealmaker attention recently. In May, Fiskars purchased WWRD Holdings Ltd, the owner of Waterford, Wedgwood, and other lifestyle brands, in May, and Yoox SpA made a deal for luxury shopping website Net-a-Porter.
