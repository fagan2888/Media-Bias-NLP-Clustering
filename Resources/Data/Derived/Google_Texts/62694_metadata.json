With 54 Republicans in the Senate, reconciliation is being seen as a possible way to move major legislation as early as this year, without having to worry about Democratic support.\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) indicated Tuesday that the idea of reconciliation will be brought up during this week\u2019s GOP retreat in Hershey, Pennsylvania.\n\n\u201cOur first goal here is to help everybody understand what the budget process is,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cI would say 75 percent of the Congress has no idea what reconciliation is, reconciling spending and/or revenue to a budget agreement, so there\u2019s a lot of education that has to go on.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt some point, we\u2019ll decide if we\u2019re going to have reconciliation, and if we do, we\u2019ll make some decision much later on,\u201d he added.\n\nAnd in the Senate, reconciliation is supported by members such as Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas).\n\nThe GOP was not expected to leave Hershey with a fully developed reconciliation plan, in part because there is an ongoing debate within the party about exactly how to use it.\n\nAs a first step, both the House and the Senate would have to pass a joint budget resolution, something both are expected to do after the Senate\u2019s spotty record of passing budgets under Democratic rule.\n\nThat budget itself is not binding, but it can include instructions to the Appropriations Committees to write legislation that reconciles with the budget plan. That legislation must be budget related, but once it\u2019s written, the rules allow it to be put on a fast track for passage in the Senate.\n\nSpecifically, debate on the bill is limited, and in the Senate, just 51 votes are needed to advance it, not 60.\n\nThe legislation in theory could be on a wide range of issues. For example, it could include the repeal of Obamacare if that issue could be framed as a budget matter.\n\nDemocrats would likely fight that, but it doesn\u2019t appear to be a stretch. Obamacare itself was passed on a reconciliation bill, and Republicans believe it could be repealed with the same procedure used to create it.\n\nBut some Republicans believe reconciliation should be used to create a privileged bill on tax reform, or one to reduce the budget deficit. The tax cuts delivered under President George W. Bush were also done under reconciliation.\n\nPart of the discussion in Hershey this week is expected to deal with which of these options, if any, to pursue.\n\nThe one big problem with a reconciliation bill is the same problem Republicans face with all other legislation \u2014 it can be vetoed by President Barack Obama. For that reason, a case could be made that reconciliation bills might end up be a fast track to a veto that can\u2019t be overridden in Congress.\n\nStill, Republicans seem likely to try it, even if its only use is a way to paint Democrats as the new \u201cparty of no\u201d that opposes all GOP ideas. Just before the retreat, a congressional aide told TheBlaze that at this point, \u201cRepublicans are expecting to include reconciliation instructions on their budget.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "gplus-count": 0, "twitter": {"description": "Congressional Republicans started formal discussions this week about whether and how to use a powerful tool known as budget reconciliation, which could make it easier to pass bills to repeal Obamacare or pursue other GOP policy goals.
