One of the main themes of the book is that patients and physicians who struggle with Medicare usually lack political power. In other words, they lack the ability to influence Congress to make changes in Medicare policy that would help them.\n\nThere are many reasons why they lack political power, but a big one is that they simply lack the numbers. That is, there are too few of them to have any impact at the voting booth or to hire lobbyists to lobby on their behalf.\n\nCase in point is a new program that Medicare has launched in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and South Carolina to cut down on the cost of non-emergency ambulance transports. Unfortunately, the crack down has put some patients like Robert Browning, who genuinely need the ambulance ride, in a tough situation.\n\nBrowning is bed-ridden with leg wounds and needs an ambulance transport to the Community Medical Center for weekly treatment. Browning now has to get approval from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) before Medicare will pay for an ambulance ride. Browning gets his ambulance rides from Abba Medical Transportation. Unfortunately, he is one of 20 patients who \u201cwhose claims were denied, and [Abba] had to stop transporting most of them, officials said. They couldn\u2019t understand the reason; at times it seemed like they couldn\u2019t get patients approved no matter how much documentation they provided.\u201d\n\nNow, Browning has to pay $250 out of pocket for each ride. \u201d\u2019We\u2019re paying for it now,\u2019 Kathie Browning said. \u2018I don\u2019t have a choice.\u2019\u201d\n\nSome background: Medicare pays for ambulance rides to the hospital and other facilities for patients who are confined to their beds and cannot be moved in a wheelchair. However, some ambulance companies seem to be abusing the service (and, perhaps, some patients are too). The cost of non-emergency ambulance transports have skyrocketed in some states. In California, such transports rose 554 percent from 2002-2011. In New Jersey, it rose 144 percent. So, last year, CMS began a pilot project to eliminate such abuse.\n\nBut as happens with so many government efforts to root out fraud and abuse, those with genuine need get caught up in the net meant to catch the fraudsters. That appears to be what has happened with Browning.\n\nMy guess is that this program will eventually expand beyond the three states in the pilot project, and patients like Browning will suffer. The reason? Well, here\u2019s how Alide Walker, billing manager for Abba, put it: \u201cI feel like they\u2019ve been given the word, \u2018You need to save money,\u2019 and they\u2019re saving money on the backs of patients that don\u2019t have a voice for themselves.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s correct. There are no groups lobbying for Medicare patients who are having trouble getting access to non-emergency ambulance rides. Nor are these patients likely to ever be a force at the voting booth. I don\u2019t have any hard statistics, but my guess is there are maybe a few thousand people like Robert Browning who are on Medicare at any given time in the U.S. Spread that out accross 50 states and 435 House Districts, and it\u2019s almost negligible.\n\nBecause the sick usually lack political power, they are unable to change government policy that causes them harm. And that\u2019s one of the biggest problems of any government health care system.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://www.conservativeblog.org/storage/Ambulance2.png?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1434469441169", "description": "On July 6, I have my first book coming out entitled Medicare&#8217;s Victims: How the U.S. Gov...", "title": "Ambulance Transport and Medicare's\u00a0Victims - Amy Ridenour's National Center Blog - A Conservative Blog"}, "blogburst-verify": "B9EORVLmLdD0z2JKwETUEmoZ", "Robots": "index,follow"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd3b2\"", "article_summary": "There are no groups lobbying for Medicare patients who are having trouble getting access to non-emergency ambulance rides.\nUnfortunately, the crack down has put some patients like Robert Browning, who genuinely need the ambulance ride, in a tough situation.\nBrowning now has to get approval from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) before Medicare will pay for an ambulance ride.\nBrowning is bed-ridden with leg wounds and needs an ambulance transport to the Community Medical Center for weekly treatment.\nOn July 6, I have my first book coming out entitled Medicare\u2019s Victims: How the U.S. Government\u2019s Largest Health Care Program Harms Patients and Impairs Physicians."}
