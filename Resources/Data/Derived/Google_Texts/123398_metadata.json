At least as far as biblical marriage goes, he got it all wrong.\n\nAn illustrative confession. I would like to arrange a biblical marriage for myself. That is, a flat-out, no-holds-barred \u201ctraditional\u201d marriage purely and distinctly in accordance with hallowed biblical criteria. Of course, I plan to follow Genesis 2:24 and \u201ccleave\u201d unto my wife. I\u2019m supposed to become \u201cof one flesh\u201d with her. But note that contrary to Pope John Paul\u2019s statement, the Bible doesn\u2019t anywhere say I can have only one wife. Just after the above-cited verse, we read in Genesis 4:19 about Lamech, who took two wives. The patriarch Abraham \u2013 the founding father of three world religions \u2014 had two, and King Solomon had 700. So I\u2019m going to marry as many times as I like, and \u201ccleave\u201d unto each one in turn, depending on the night of the week.\n\nI also plan on following the examples laid down in the Good Book and helping myself to the sexual favors of our domestic help, which I will not, however, enslave, as Leviticus 25:44-46 allows. If any putative brother of mine should kick the bucket, I will immediately wed his wife, as the Bible (Genesis 38:8-10) commands me to do, on pain of death. (Strangely, the only known death-penalty victim of this obscure biblical statute was the hapless Onan, who has undeservedly gone down in history as the world\u2019s most notorious masturbator, when, in fact, he was only a spiteful practitioner of coitus interruptus.)\n\nIf any of my proliferating wives dare rebuke me, I\u2019ll thunder words from Ephesians 5:22-33 at them. They must, that verse says, submit unto me \u201cas unto the Lord\u201d Himself. And if they should behave foolishly, I intend to beat them, as is stipulated in Proverbs 10:12-31.\n\nAlso, I, as the Lord-designated (per Ephesians 5:23) head of my household, intend to enforce other biblical injunctions as well, including those of Leviticus. I will administer death or beatings, as the Law ordains, to my wives if they reap the edges of a field, plant differing seeds in that field (both from 19:19), pick up fallen grapes in our vineyard (19:10), sell an Israelite as a slave (25:40), or wear clothes mixing different kinds of fabric (again from 19:19).\n\nIn behaving this way, it might seem as though I\u2019m breaking a raft of laws, state and federal. I may well be, but I don\u2019t care! Doing otherwise would \u201cburden my religion.\u201d I\u2019m obeying a \u201chigher law\u201d \u2013 the one decreed by the Almighty Himself. I can quote the Holy Scripture chapter and verse to prove it. That I\u2019ve publicly decreed my atheism matters not; I can always say I converted. Who can disprove me? In any case, I have a growing number of Religious Freedom Restoration Acts to back me up, as well as the implicit support of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. Want to put me on trial? I dare you.\n\nSeriously, though, marriage as the ancient Israelites conceived it, and as demonstrated throughout the Bible\u2019s rapine-replete rants, sagas of savagery and mind-deadening genealogical longueurs, has precious little to do with what faith-derived custom and Western history A.D. have bequeathed to us: the \u201ctraditional\u201d matrimony between one man and one woman. We can be thankful for that. Those discriminating against same-sex couples, alleging a RFRA-type \u201cburden\u201d to their religion, and planning, if necessary, to present a RFRA-based defense, should beware: the sainted scripture they plan on adducing in court consists of \u201cwild and disorderly compositions\u201d (to quote Thomas Paine) so larded with evidence contrary to their case that they should not stand a chance of prevailing, at least before a rational judge in a fair court.\n\nWe don\u2019t, however, live in a rational, fair world. The Supreme Court\u2019s recent Obergefell v. Hodges ruling in favor of same-sex marriage should have been a no-brainer, permitting, as it does, Americans of different sexual orientations to enjoy equal protection of the law, as the Constitution mandates, and as the Declaration of Independence, with its phrase \u201cthe pursuit of happiness,\u201d proclaims. But the case split the bench five-to-four, reflecting, in a way, the division in the United States as a whole, where, despite the burgeoning tide of nonbelief and a public ever more receptive to same-sex marriage (six out of 10 Americans now support it), seven out of 10 still call themselves Christians, with evangelicals accounting for a quarter of the entire population and actually increasing in number.\n\nSo it should shock no one that for some of the faith-addled, the SCOTUS ruling settled nothing at all. A county circuit clerk in Mississippi protested that her \u201cfinal authority is the Bible\u201d and that \u201cthe Supreme Court\u2019s decision violates my core values as a Christian.\u201d She quit, rather than issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. Clerks in three Kentuckian counties have also refused to give marriage licenses to gays, even though the governor of that state has stated that he would obey the law. Kentucky County Clerk Casey Davis, appearing on MSNBC, noted that he had sworn \u201cso help me God\u201d to assume his duties and defended his decision to halt the issuance of all marriage licenses as a matter of religious conviction. He will not resign, but plans to stand his ground. South Dakota\u2019s Republican attorney general seems to have found a compromise of sorts, permitting religious dissenters to refuse to do their job, as long as someone else in the office will. Which would not work for Decatur County in Tennessee, where the entire staff in the clerks\u2019 office quit and stormed out.\n\nThe situation in Alabama is direst. There, 17 county clerk offices are refusing to wed gays, and surely take comfort in the open letter Win Johnson, an attorney working for Alabama Supreme Court Justice Roy Moore (who claims that \u201cour rights do not come from the Constitution, they come from God\u201d) wrote to Governor Robert Bentley, scolding him for saying he would observe Obergefell v. Hodges. Johnson addressed the clerks, demanding of them, \u201cPublic official, what will you do? Will you stand up for the law of Alabama, for the people, for the weak and vulnerable, for the law of God? Or will you capitulate? Will you become complicit in the takeover by the wicked?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The faithful want to follow a \"higher law\" than the Supreme Court. Even some justices.
