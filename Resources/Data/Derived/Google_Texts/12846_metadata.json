But after the terror at the Emanuel AME Church, the presidential candidate emerged as one of its truest voices.\n\nBefore today, Ben Carson was far from the voice of reason in the Republican party. The brain surgeon and presidential candidate has purveyed theories like \u201cObamacare is worse than slavery\u201d and Obama\u2019s America is reminiscent of Nazi Germany.\n\nNow, however, Carson has the distinction of being the lone Republican candidate to be honest and plainspoken about the fact that racism was the motive for the Charleston church shooting.\n\nRandall Hill/Reuters\n\nHow we got here is a sad indictment of American politics, where candidates would rather shove their fist in their mouths or speak in riddles than risk upsetting anyone with the reality of racism.\n\nIt started yesterday afternoon. Just before Rand Paul took to the stage of the Omni Shoreham Hotel in Washington, where a crowd of evangelical conservatives waited for him to speak, police arrested Dylann Storm Roof. A 21 year old white supremacist, Roof had, the night before, walked into a historic black church in Charleston, South Carolina, sat among its congregation for a time, and then opened fire, murdering nine of them.\n\nIt seemed obvious that Paul would address the tragedy before the self-anointed \u201cFaith and Freedom Coalition.\u201d\n\nIf the Republican Party is truly shifting to appeal to new (i.e., less white) constituencies, it is Paul who is helping to lead the way by openly discussing things Republicans of primaries past wouldn\u2019t touch, like the failed war on drugs, criminal justice reform, and the fact that \u201crace\u2026skew[s] the application\u201d of justice in America.\n\nBut, when Paul opened his mouth to discuss the terrorist attack in Charleston, what came out was a confusing string of words designed to assure the Christian crowd that none of it would\u2019ve happened if more Americans were like them.\n\n\u201cWhat kind of person goes into church and shoots nine people?\u201d he asked. \u201cThere\u2019s a sickness in our country, there\u2019s something terribly wrong, but it isn\u2019t going to be fixed by your government. It\u2019s people straying away, it\u2019s people not understanding where salvation comes from. And I think that if we understand that, we\u2019ll understand and have better expectations of what we get from our government.\u201d\n\nPaul didn\u2019t say anything about Roof\u2019s confederate flag license plate, his pro-apartheid emblazoned jacket, or his blatant act of domestic terror.\n\nTed Cruz, as Talking Point\u2019s Memo\u2019s Brendan James put it, \u201ckinda dipped his toe in,\u201d to the topic of race when he held a moment of silence for the victims and said, \u201cToday the body of Christ is in mourning that a sick and deranged person came and prayed with a historically black congregation for an hour, and then murdered nine innocent souls.\u201d\n\nThe following day, the Faith and Freedom Coalition\u2019s event was still going. Chris Christie took to the stage and acknowledged that the \u201cconduct\u201d of the shooter was \u201cdepraved [and] unthinkable,\u201d but \u201conly the goodwill and the love of the American people can let those folks know that that act was unacceptable, disgraceful that we need to do more to show that we love each other.\u201d He said nothing about race.\n\nJeb Bush, at the same event, said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what was on the mind or the heart of the man who committed these atrocious crimes.\u201d After his speech, Bush told The Huffington post, \u201cit was a horrific act and I don\u2019t know what the background of it is, but it was an act of hatred.\u201d Asked again if race was behind the attack, Bush said, \u201cI don\u2019t know. Looks like to me it was, but we\u2019ll find out all the information. It\u2019s clear it was an act of raw hatred, for sure. Nine people lost their lives, they were African-American. You can judge what it is.\u201d\n\nBrian Snyder / Reuters\n\nRick Santorum and Bobby Jindal similarly evaded the issue, while Marco Rubio ignored the shooting altogether, save for a polite Tweet, but spoke of his love for the Second Amendment during his Thursday speech to the Faith and Freedom crowd.\n\nLindsey Graham, who is the Senator from South Carolina, initially suggested the persecution of Christians was as likely a reason for the shootings as racism. \u201cThere are real people out there that are organized to kill people based on race. This guy is just whacked out. But it\u2019s 2015, there are people out there looking for Christians to kill them.\u201d On Friday, however, while visiting Charleston, Graham had made a shift. He told The New York Times\u2019 Ashley Parker, \u201cthe only reason these people are dead is because they\u2019re black.\u201d\n\nGet The Beast In Your Inbox!

We know that.\u201d But the former Texas governor criticized president Obama\u2019s call for gun control. \u201cSo I mean there are a lot of issues here underlying this that we as a country need to have a conversation about rather than just the knee-jerk reaction of saying, \u2018if we can just take all the guns away, this won\u2019t happen.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nDuring an appearance on MSNBC, Martin O\u2019Malley acknowledged race as the motivating factor but did so timidly. \u201cFrom the reports I read, and let\u2019s be honest with one another, the facts are still evolving here. I mean, it would appear that the racial motivation was certainly a big part of what happened here.\u201d\n\nIn contrast, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders sounded like civil rights activists.\n\nClinton said that in order to make sense of the shooting, \u201cwe have to be honest\u2014we have to face hard truths about race, violence, guns and division,\u201d and offered words of comfort from Dr. Martin Luther King.\n\nSanders was even more direct.\n\n\u201cThe Charleston church killings are a tragic reminder of the ugly stain of racism that still taints our nation,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cWhile we have made significant progress in advancing civil rights in this country, we are far from eradication racism.\u201d\n\nBut it was Carson who stuck out amid the cowardly tongue-twisting of the majority of his party\u2019s candidates with his straightforwardness.\n\n\"Racial based hate is still very much alive as last night so violently reminds us,\u201d he wrote on Facebook. \u201cI fear our intolerance of one another is the new battle ground of evil. Today many feel it is ok to hate someone who thinks different than you do\u2026As a brain surgeon I can assure you that all of our brains look the same, no matter what our skin color or party affiliation.\u201d\n\nAnd so here we are, with Ben Carson\u2014the right-wing sideshow who, despite competitive polling, could never truly be taken seriously as a candidate because of his proclivity for voicing off-the-rails theories and his complete lack of political experience\u2014is teaching the rest of the Republican field how to sound like a human being when discussing a tragedy caused by racism in America. The real absurdity of American politics is that the people running for office are more often than not the ones stupid enough to believe that they can only win if they are so agreeable that they ignore reality altogether, fearing that acknowledging its ugliness might reflect it onto them.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "olivianuzzi"}, "keywords": "2016, Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton, Ben Carson, Republican Party, Hillary Clinton, u.s. poli, Chris Christie, Charleston Shooting, Jeb Bush, Charleston,South Carolina,United States, 2016 Election, Google", "publicationDate": 201506191905, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "news_keywords": "2016 election, Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton, Ben Carson, Republican Party, Hillary Clinton, US Politics, Chris Christie, Charleston Shooting, Jeb Bush", "pageNum": 1, "title": "Crazy Ben Carson Is The GOPs Voice of Sanity on Charleston", "tags": "entity:event/2016_election,entity:person/bernie_sanders,obsessional:Hillary Clinton,entity:person/ben_carson,entity:organization/republican_party,entity:person/hillary_clinton,topic:politics,entity:person/chris_christie,entity:event/charleston_shooting,entity:person/jeb_bush,entity:city/charleston_south_carolina_united_states,obsessional:2016-election,syndication:syndication-google", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "He\u2019s considered one of the Republicans\u2019 wild men.
