If it\u2019s not the right day, people who need medical attention have to travel to a different hospital.\n\n\u201cGreek patients are lining the hallways, waiting and hoping for treatment,\u201d Racer said. \u201cWhat else can be expected when a global budget set by the national government determines how many beds are available?\u201d\n\nThere can never be enough beds to serve everyone\u2019s needs in a system where government determines limits on health care spending, Racer says. Economic troubles only exacerbate the problem.\n\n\u201cThe Greek health care crisis demonstrates clearly that a federal health care system dependent on government funding has deadly and dangerous effects when the nation\u2019s economy falters,\u201d Racer said.\n\nRacer says prescription drug shortages are another serious problem common in government-controlled health care systems.\n\n\u201cThe Greek health care system is failing to provide needed prescription medicine to its patients,\u201d Racer said. \u201cLiberal health care reformers in the United States demand that our government either purchase prescription medicine or set price limits on it to make it more affordable, but what good is affordable medicine if there is no money in the nationalized system to [buy it?]\u201d\n\nCautionary Tales\n\nRedmond Weissenberger, chairman and executive director of the Ludwig von Mises Institute\u2013Canada, says there is a definite progression from the Greece and Canada of today to the United States of tomorrow under Obamacare.\n\nThe problems in Ontario, Canada\u2019s most populous province, illustrate the Canadian attempt at using central planning to achieve better outcomes for patients and their pocketbooks has been an abject failure, Weissenberger says.\n\nWith twice the debt of California, Ontario is now the most indebted sub-sovereign borrower in the world. In 2015, nearly 50 percent of the budget of Ontario consisted solely of health care and interest on debt, says Weissenberger.\n\n\u201cAnd what has this achieved?\u201d Weissenberger asks. \u201cLong wait times, a de facto multiple-tier system based on [connections], and numerous instances of \u2018healthcare tourism,\u2019 which is a euphemism for Canadians who must leave the country to get the sometimes-lifesaving care they cannot obtain in their own country.\n\n\u201cObamacare will quickly become a \u2018ball and chain\u2019 attached to the American health care system that will inevitably end up in bankruptcy and poorer outcomes for the most vulnerable, as it has in Canada and Greece,\u201d Weissenberger said.\n\nD.
