Parking will be free at Sports Authority Field.\n\nAbout 17,000 people a day were expected to attend Riot Fest in Byers. It\u2019s not clear if that estimate will change now that it\u2019s in Denver.\n\nPetryshyn stated online that he was \u201cutterly incensed\u201d by Arapahoe County\u2019s decision last week to deny the festival a permit.\n\nAt the same time, Riot Fest organizers made it clear Friday that they hope to make Byers their home in the future and have filed an appeal of Arapahoe County\u2019s permit decision. Riot Fest said it received many letters of support from Byers residents and others who live nearby.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a community we care about tremendously, \u2026 and just to pack up and watch the town disappear in our rear window is not an option,\u201d Petryshyn wrote.\n\nThe festival is offering free tickets and a free shuttle to any resident of Byers who wants to attend the show in Denver.\n\nJohn Aguilar: 303-954-1695, jaguilar@denverpost.com or twitter.com/abuvthefold", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Riot Fest concert moves to Sports Authority Field in Denver", "title": "Riot Fest concert moves to Sports Authority Field in Denver", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/07/18/riot-fest-concert-moves-to-sports-authority-field-in-denver/", "image": {"width": 605, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140718__riotfest-colorado-2013p1-1.jpg", "height": 403}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140718__riotfest-colorado-2013p1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-18T10:05:46+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T11:20:48+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The organizers of Riot Fest announced Friday morning that they have found a new Colorado home for their three-day September music extravaganza: Sports Authority Field at Mile High in Denver.\nRiot Fest said it received many letters of support from Byers residents and others who live nearby.\nAbout 17,000 people a day were expected to attend Riot Fest in Byers.\nAt the same time, Riot Fest organizers made it clear Friday that they hope to make Byers their home in the future and have filed an appeal of Arapahoe County\u2019s permit decision.\nThe festival is offering free tickets and a free shuttle to any resident of Byers who wants to attend the show in Denver."}
