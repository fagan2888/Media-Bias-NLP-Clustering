There’s more confirmation that Trevor Noah was not the first person offered Jon Stewart’s gig.

The Daily Beast confirms that Comedy Central also asked Amy Schumer if she wanted to anchor “The Daily Show.”

Schumer considered the offer but ultimately declined — but according to the Beast’s story, she took it quite seriously.

“I was so honored to be asked and considered,” she told the Daily Beast. “With Comedy Central, I project so much ‘You’re my parents!’ on the network and the people that run it, so them saying, ‘We believe in you and trust that you can do this,’ I thought, ‘Oh my god, thank you!’”
