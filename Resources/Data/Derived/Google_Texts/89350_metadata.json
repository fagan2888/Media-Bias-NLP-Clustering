In states that are not, households below 100 percent of poverty may be left with no affordable source of health insurance. (But they won\u2019t be fined in that case.)\n\n\u2022 In states that are expanding Medicaid, households with incomes between 133 percent and 250 percent of poverty will receive tax credits to lower the cost of premiums, and will also be eligible for plans that have lower out-of-pocket costs such as deductibles and copays. In states that aren't expanding Medicaid, households with incomes between 100 percent and 250 percent of poverty will get these types of help.\n\n\u2022 In all states, households with incomes between 250 percent and 400 percent of poverty will get the premium tax credits, but not the lowered out-of-pocket costs.\n\n\n\nThe chart below explains what that means for you.
