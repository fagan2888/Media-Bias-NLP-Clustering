That $40 million in expected tax revenue is going up in smoke because banks and credit card companies are balking at playing along.\n\nAlthough \u201cMary Jane\u201d may be perfectly legal to Colorado, it\u2019s still considered verboten by the feds. And therein lies the rub.\n\nFinancial institutions are heavily regulated by federal law, and until they get a clear ruling that it\u2019s OK to run pot sales through credit and debit cards, transactions will have to be made strictly in cash, according to Fox News.\n\nAnd records of cash sales tend to magically disappear, or are at least heavily under-reported.\n\n\u201cSo far Colorado has not been able to come up with a solution to the banking problem,\u201d state Sen. David Balmer told Fox. \u201cThe vast majority of sales will not be accounted for.\u201d\n\nAccording to Fox:\n\nMarijuana is considered an illegal drug by the federal government, and laws such as the Bank Secrecy Act carry severe penalties for banks. Last week, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said the feds will soon issue regulations opening banking services to state-sanctioned marijuana businesses.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want just huge amounts of cash in these places,\u201d Holder said in a speech at the University of Virginia, according to Fox. \u201cThey want to be able to use the banking system. And so we will be issuing some regulations I think very soon to deal with that issue.\u201d\n\nWatch Tim Tebow\u2019s testosterone-packed Super Bowl ad\n\nIn the meantime, the state can say so long to that tax revenue, especially with retailers taking extraordinary measures to avoid paying the state its due. \u201cSome have set up limited liability corporations to create 1 degree of separation to try to open bank accounts,\u201d Fox reported.\n\nEven cash sales are having a difficult time passing the smell test. Literally.\n\n\u201cThe large cash deposits smell like marijuana, so some of the businesses are spraying the cash with room freshener or perfume to hide the marijuana smell,\u201d Balmer said. \u201cThe banks are even more suspicious when they have a person trying to deposit a large cash deposit that smells like perfume.\u201d\n\nWithout accurate financial records, the state\u2019s revenue department can examine a business\u2019 inventor records to get a fuller view of the sales picture.\n\n\u201cThere is a new inventory tool that was launched on Jan. 1, 2014, which tracks inventory from seed to sale,\u201d Casey Bauer, spokesman for the state Department of Regulatory Agencies, said.\n\nBut just because a business keeps two sets of books for financial records doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t more books being kept in secret \u2014 such as inventory records.\n\n\u201cThe majority of our marijuana retailers are trying to be honest,\u201d Balmer, said. \u201cBut this is the Wild West, and nobody really knows how to be lawful because this still violates federal law.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "BizPac Review", "description": "If Colorado lawmakers thought legalizing recreational marijuana was going to mean a big payday for their state, they\u2019re getting a rude awakening.
