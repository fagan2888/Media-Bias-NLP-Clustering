They must be held earlier than usual because the 2016 legislative session will begin in January, rather than March.\n\nHouse Speaker Steve Crisafulli released a statement of his own: \"While the Senate did not give our health care reforms a vote in committee or on the Senate floor, we understand that you cannot force another Chamber to take up legislation.\"\n\nIn the regular session, the House refused to take up the Senate's plan for expansion of health-care coverage to about 800,000 low-income Floridians. It would have used Medicaid-expansion funds from the Affordable Care Act.\n\nDuring the first week of the special session, the House defeated the plan 72 to 41 along party lines, with Democrats in support and all but four Republicans opposed.\n\nSenate President Andy Gardiner had left the decision on whether to take up bills other than the budget to committee chairs. Bean held a workshop last week on five of the six House health bills; he canceled a committee meeting that was to have been held Tuesday.\n\nThe bills that died were:\n\n-- HB 31A, which would have abolished the requirement for a state-issued \u201cCertificate of Need\u201d (CON) before a hospital is built or expanded, or adds any of several high-risk sophisticated services.\n\n--HB 27A, which would have allowed advanced registered nurse practitioners and physicians' assistants to prescribe certain drugs that have extra controls because of their potential for addiction.\n\n--HB 23A, which would have allowed outpatient surgery centers to keep patients in post-operative recovery longer and would have set up a new licensure category for \"recovery centers.\"\n\n--HB 25A, which would have set up a structure for doctors to contract directly with patients for payment rather than go through an insurer.\n\n--HB 29A, which would have required hospitals to give notice to OB-GYNs before closing their obstetrical service.\n\nA bill concerning another major issue, overhauling state workers' health insurance (HB 21A), was assigned to a different committee. No meeting was ever set.", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "Bills that involve state workers' health insurance, nurse-practitioners and hospital regulations died during this week's Legislative special session", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://health.wusf.usf.edu/post/senate-lets-house-health-bills-die", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/healthnewsfl/files/styles/medium/public/201302/Aaron_Bean.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Bills that involve state workers' health insurance, nurse-practitioners and hospital regulations died during this week's Legislative special session", "title": "Senate Lets House Health Bills Die"}, "story_id": 414887854, "twitter": {"site": "@HealthNewsFL", "card": "summary", "creator": "@HealthNewsFL"}, "author": "Carol Gentry", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Senate Lets House Health Bills Die"}, "nid": 11001, "datePublished": "2015-06-16", "keywords": "health care reform, Medicaid expansion, Florida Legislature 2015, nurse practitioners, physicians assistants, certificate of need, direct primary care, recovery care", "wordCount": 468, "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3460\"", "article_summary": "The issues contained in the House bills require \"a thorough and proper vetting,\" said Bean, R-Fernandina Beach.\nBean held a workshop last week on five of the six House health bills; he canceled a committee meeting that was to have been held Tuesday.\nBills that involve state workers' health insurance, nurse-practitioners and hospital regulations died during this week's Legislative special session because the Senate has declined to consider them.\nInstead, he requested creation of a joint House and Senate task force on health care policy innovation to take up the issues in committee meetings starting in September.\nSenate President Andy Gardiner had left the decision on whether to take up bills other than the budget to committee chairs."}
