The six states combined had nearly 647,000 customers at latest word, down from more than 753,000.\n\nThat\u2019s an early sign ObamaCare\u2019s individual mandate isn\u2019t working as well as its supporters hoped. With the mandate tax penalty jumping to a minimum of $695 per adult for going without coverage this year, the fact that people are opting not to pay suggests that many would prefer to gamble on going uninsured and pay a fine rather than buy a bronze plan with a deductible of $6,000-plus.\n\nIf the same rate of attrition occurred in the rest of the country, which is by no means clear from the small sample, that would cut enrollment to just under 11 million from the 12.7 million who signed up.\n\nMinuteman, with nearly 13,500 customers and nearly 40% of bronze-plan members, trails Anthem (ANTM) as the biggest player on the exchange, excluding Medicaid customers up to 138% of the poverty level. Near-poor customers became eligible this year for marketplace plans through a state waiver granted by the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nCentene (CNC) unit Ambetter from N.H. Healthy Families plan has 20,800 Medicaid waiver customers, nearly half the 41,800 total.\n\nMinuteman officials said they were being financially conservative in requesting the high rate increase and could substantially lower the request, but there\u2019s good reason for their caution.\n\nThe company, which also competes in Mass., had to pay out $2,150 per plan member last year into ObamaCare\u2019s risk-adjustment program, based on 2014 results. The program shifts funds from insurers who get a relatively healthy group of enrollees to those who attract sicker customers. Yet insurers and experts alike have said it does a poor job of accurately balancing the risk taken on by insurers.\n\nNow Minuteman, expecting even worse, has set aside $3,000 per 2015 customer. HHS will report risk-adjustment results for 2015 on June 30, and Minuteman will update its rate request in July.\n\nSmall carriers like Minuteman would like to see risk-adjustment pay-outs capped at a fixed percentage of premiums. But others, like UnitedHealth (UNH), have suggested they\u2019re already being short-changed. (UnitedHealth this month said it would pull out of all but a \u201chandful\u201d of exchanges in 2017.)\n\nThe Obama administration brought stakeholders together for a big risk-adjustment meeting last month to hash out the future of the program.\n\nMinuteman this year is offering the cheapest bronze plan and the two cheapest silver plans in New Hampshire. Its lowest-cost bronze offering is 11% cheaper than its nearest rival, Harvard Pilgrim Health.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The lowest-cost and second-biggest participant on New Hampshire's ObamaCare exchange has requested a 45.2% premium hike for 2017.", "og": {"site_name": "Investor's Business Daily", "description": "The lowest-cost and second-biggest participant on New Hampshire\u2019s ObamaCare exchange has requested a 45.2% premium hike for 2017.", "title": "New Hampshire ObamaCare Customers Exit; 45% Rate Hike Eyed", "url": "http://www.investors.com/politics/policy-analysis/n-h-obamacare-customers-exit-45-rate-hike-eyed/", "image": {"width": 1000, "identifier": "http://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/AP100527144925.jpg", "height": 565}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/AP100527144925.jpg?w=640", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@IBDInvestors"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-ibd-favicon-v7-270x270.png", "keywords": "obamacare 2017 premiums,obamacare enrollment,obamacare risk-adjustment program,obamacare", "date": "2016-04-25 11:05:30:-08:00", "article": {"published_time": "2016-04-25T18:05:30+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-25T18:05:30+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcab8\"", "article_summary": "Minuteman Health, the lowest-cost and second-biggest participant on New Hampshire\u2019s ObamaCare exchange, warned last week that it\u2019s requesting a 45.2% premium hike for 2017.\nHealthy Families plan has 20,800 Medicaid waiver customers, nearly half the 41,800 total.\nThe six states combined had nearly 647,000 customers at latest word, down from more than 753,000.\nMinuteman, with nearly 13,500 customers and nearly 40% of bronze-plan members, trails Anthem (ANTM) as the biggest player on the exchange, excluding Medicaid customers up to 138% of the poverty level.\nHHS will report risk-adjustment results for 2015 on June 30, and Minuteman will update its rate request in July."}
