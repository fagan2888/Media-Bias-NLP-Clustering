PunditFact fact-checked two recent claims.\n\nRepeal, replace Obamacare\n\nFox News host Sean Hannity hammered home one idea during his post-election analysis Nov. 5.\n\nTalking to Republican Louisiana U.S. Rep. Bill Cassidy, who is in a runoff with incumbent Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu, Hannity said, \"Every single candidate like yourself running for office said you will vote to repeal and replace Obamacare.\"\n\nLater, in an interview with Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus, Hannity said, \"Every candidate that won in the Senate promised to repeal and replace Obamacare,\" Hannity said.\n\nAnd he made the same point with Cory Gardner, who defeated incumbent Democrat Sen. Mark Udall in Colorado. \"Every Republican that won elections last night, including yourself, you said repeal/replace Obamacare.\"\n\nAll within the span of an hour.\n\nIn looking at the freshman GOP class of the U.S. Senate, Hannity has a point. His claim rates Mostly True.\n\nYou can take a look at each new senator\u2019s position on Obamacare here , but basically all are in favor of repealing the health care law as it stands on the books. As far as replacing the law goes, most have ideas -- though some ideas are more nebulous than others.\n\nKeystone XL\n\nMany people expect the Republican Congress to try and push President Barack Obama to approve the Keystone XL pipeline.\n\nFox and Friends host Anna Kooiman discussed the number of jobs the pipeline project would bring.\n\n\"And if you would just approve the Keystone XL pipeline, there would be tens of thousands of jobs created,\" Kooiman said Nov. 6, addressing Obama.\n\nThe job-creation argument behind the controversial pipeline is one fact-checkers have reviewed many times . The bottom line: Keystone isn\u2019t the massive jobs generator that some make it out to be.\n\nKooiman\u2019s claim rates Mostly False .\n\nAs far as new jobs go, the State Department estimates the operation of the pipeline will only create 35 permanent, full-time jobs and 15 temporary contractors. The full-time workers would be \"required for annual operations, including routine inspections, maintenance and repair.\" Some would work in a Nebraska field office.\n\nThe lack of many full-time positions makes sense, given that the project is to build a pipeline so that tar sands can travel without the need of rail cars or ships.\n\nThere are, however, temporary jobs that would be supported by building the $8 billion pipeline over one or two years.\n\nOver the course of up to two years of construction, the State Department estimates a total of 42,100 jobs \"would be supported by construction of the proposed project.\" Some jobs are directly tied to the pipeline and construction. Other jobs are simply a nature of how spending $8 billion ripples out into the economy. And more than 99 percent are temporary.", "article_metadata": {"description": "With the 2014 midterms in the rearview mirror, pundits are looking ahead to what a GOP-controlled Congress might do.
