Newly elected conservative Kentucky Governor-elect Matt Bevin is changing the state’s marriage licenses for clerks like Kim Davis who object to same sex marriage.

“One thing I will take care of right away is we will remove the names of the county clerks from the marriage form,” he old reporters Friday according to the Courier-Journal.

Davis, who famously served five days in jail for refusing to have her name on any gay marriage licenses in protest of the Supreme Court’s decision to legalize gay marriage in all 50 states, met with Bevin upon her release, the Courier-Journal reported.

Steve Beshear, the outgoing Democrat governor, refused Davis’s request to remove clerk’s names from the licenses and told Davis to take it up with the legislature when they are back in session in January.

Bevin, a tea party favorite and only the second Republican governor of the state in 4 decades, disagrees.

“That [removing the clerk’s names] is going to be done. The argument that that cannot be done is baloney,” he told reporters.

“We’ve already changed those forms three times for crying out loud,” he added. “I do intend to make that change. We will take the names off of those forms. We will do that by executive order. We will do it right out of the gate.”
