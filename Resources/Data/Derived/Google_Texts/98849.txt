— Six different players scored, and Stephan Vigier and Andrew Rowe had three points, as the South Carolina Stingrays enjoyed an offensive outburst in a 6-1 victory over Wheeling at the WesBanco Arena on Saturday night.

South Carolina tied a season high with six goals and earned a weekend split in the two-game set with the Nailers.

Defenseman Wade Epp scored his first professional goal at the 4:39 mark of the opening period. The power-play goal came from the high slot, as Epp beat Wheeling goaltender Frankie Palazzese through the five-hole.

Just over a minute later, Jared Staal struck for his first goal of the season. David Pacan collected the lone assist.

Joe Devin added to the lead with his fifth goal of the season at 14:27 of the first period, chipping a Rowe pass over Palazzese to make it 3-0.

The Stingrays add a pair of goals in the second period as Colin Mulvey and Vigier both struck for the second straight night. Vigier’s goal extended the lead to 5-0 and ended Palazzse’s night. He was replaced by Casey DeSmith after allowing five goals on 26 shots.

Jordan Kwas scored his first goal as a member of the Stingrays and second goal of the season on a rebound off a Bobby Shea shot to make it 6-0 at 9:54 of the third period.

Rays goaltender Vitek Vanecek had his shutout bid spoiled by a late goal by Zach Torquato with only 18 seconds to play.
