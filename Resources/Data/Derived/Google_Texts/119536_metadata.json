However, he added, the additional administrative burdens were the only way to gain coverage for hundreds of thousands of people. \u201cIt\u2019s all part of the quid pro quo,\" he said. \"In Arkansas, in Iowa, in Michigan, would the expansion have happened at all if not for these types of things? I think the answer is pretty clearly no.\"\n\nTo expand access to health insurance to low-income Americans, the ACA raised Medicaid eligibility up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level (around $16,000 for an individual, $33,000 for a family of four). Or, that was the plan. Then the Supreme Court threw a curveball with its 2012 ruling: the law was upheld, but each individual state would choose whether to expand Medicaid or not. Many observers thought states would take the deal, since the feds would pay most of the costs\u2014100 percent for the first three years, gradually falling to 90 percent by 2020. But statehouses were packed with lawmakers saying things like \u201cour view is that supporting Medicaid expansion is really embracing President Obama\u2019s law.\u201d\n\nThe politics were toxic enough that many GOP-controlled states declined billions of dollars. The refusnik states left a mammoth gap in Obamacare\u2019s intended coverage expansion, pushing the administration to the negotiating table. This opened up a divide within the Republican Party in state legislatures. Some conservatives stuck with middle-finger federalism. Others sought to make a deal.\n\nCritics from both the left and the right suggest that Republicans pushing for alternative versions of Medicaid expansion are simply looking for political cover to accept federal dollars their states need. David Sanders, an Arkansas state senator and one of the key Republican architects of the private option, counters that they were using their leverage to enact conservative reform ideas never envisioned in the ACA. \u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity to fundamentally transform the system,\u201d he told me in a phone interview.\n\nWhatever their motivation, red states have been lining up to expand coverage via these demonstration waivers, which are meant to allow states to experiment with the Medicaid program. The experiments red states propose align neatly with GOP talking points, typically focusing on one or more of these ideas: offering private health insurance plans rather than the traditional Medicaid program; \u201cskin in the game\u201d such as cost-sharing or charging even the impoverished some kind of premium; tying coverage to wellness programs; tying coverage to work programs (thus far the Obama administration has drawn a line in the sand and won\u2019t allow work requirements); programs, such as savings accounts, aimed at trying to get poor beneficiaries to act more like consumers with regard to their health care services.\n\n\u201cAll of those ideas, leaving aside their policy merits, they all presuppose a pretty intensive level of government involvement in people\u2019s lives,\u201d Alker, an expert on Medicaid waivers, told me by phone. Alker points out that the original proposal by Pennsylvania suggested that the state would eventually be tracking everything from cholesterol level to work history to legal record. (In the end, the feds accepted just four of Pennsylvania\u2019s initial 24 waiver requests.) The implicit bargain has been to offer a social safety net for the poor, but only via an intrusive nanny state.\n\nThis is a familiar story: see Florida\u2019s program to drug-test welfare recipients, which lost money and was struck down by the courts. When it comes to programs for poor Americans, some conservative reform efforts lean toward administratively cumbersome, paternalistic programs. Backers of these programs argue that they encourage \u201cpersonal responsibility,\u201d but implementing them does carry a price tag.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no question in my mind that the administrative costs associated with these approaches are something that we need to keep a very close eye on,\u201d Alker said. \u201cFundamentally we know that Medicaid has much lower administrative costs than private insurance. Then you add on top of it all of these different policy objectives that are driven by intense politics. Intense politics don\u2019t usually make for good policy.\u201d\n\nMore complex programs can also be more confusing for beneficiaries. State officials in Arkansas have suggested that the Health Independence Accounts would serve as an educational tool, modeling how to be consumers of private insurance, but it's just as likely that beneficiaries will simply be baffled by the genuinely confusing structure and rules. Trying to latch GOP hobby horses onto Medicaid and low-income beneficiaries can make for an awkward fit\u2014in practice, the HIAs aren\u2019t much like private insurance, aren\u2019t much like Health Savings Accounts, and don\u2019t clearly incentivize the most cost-effective ways of using the health care system. To make matters worse, state Republicans have banned state-appropriated outreach funds to help eligible beneficiaries enroll in the private option and navigate the system.\n\nUltimately, the $15 million a year the HIAs will cost to run is a pittance relative to the total cost of Medicaid expansion. But there are real concerns about whether the private option itself could turn out to be significantly more costly than traditional Medicaid. It\u2019s too early to come to any definitive conclusions on that front, but it\u2019s a huge question for the federal budget as other states explore similar schemes.\n\nSanders told me that the HIAs are just a \u201cfirst iteration\u201d and emphasizes that the private option will evolve over time. Part of the goal, he said, was to encourage red states to piggyback off of one other with conservative reform ideas, with an eye toward a second round of waivers that the ACA will make available in 2017 to give states more room to tailor changes. \u201cThe ultimate goal is to reach state-based innovation,\u201d Sanders said.\n\nIn the meantime, Alker worries that the complexities may discourage people in these states from accessing care. \u201cI don\u2019t have any confidence on the ground that beneficiaries will be clear on what\u2019s going on because the policy itself is very, very complicated,\u201d she said. \u201cI think what\u2019s disheartening about the situation is that the research is very clear that charging premiums to very low-income people will deter enrollment and that charging co-payments will deter them from getting needed care.\u201d\n\nThe various GOP-led reforms and the added bureaucratic complexity that come with them are the price for the Obama administration to bring red states into the fold.
