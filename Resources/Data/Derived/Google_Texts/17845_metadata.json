But after highlighting how children, low-income workers, and retirees were disadvantaged by government-run healthcare,I soon realized that I wasn\u2019t saying anything new or different.\n\nHeck, ObamaCare has been such a disaster that lots of people have been writing lots of good articles about the law\u2019s failure and how various segments of the population are being unjustly harmed.\n\nSo I chose a different approach. I decided to identify groups that deserve to suffer because of the law. Or at least to highlight slices of the population that are not very deserving of sympathy.\n\nSome politicians and staffers of Capitol Hill, for instance, are very upset about the prospect of being subjected to the law that they inflicted on the rest of the country. Gee, my heart breaks for them.\n\nThe bureaucrats at the IRS are agitated about the possibility of living under ObamaCare, even though the IRS got new powers as a result of the law. How sad, cry me a river.\n\nProfessors at Harvard University, including many who supported ObamaCare, are now upset that the law is hurting them. Oh, the inhumanity!\n\nNow we have another group to add to this list. And this group is definitely in the deserve-to-suffer category.\n\nThat\u2019s because we\u2019re going to look at the big insurance companies that supported ObamaCare, but now are squealing because the law isn\u2019t working and they\u2019re not getting the bailouts they were promised.\n\nHere are some excerpts from a column by the irreplaceable Tim Carney of theWashington Examiner.\n\nUntil recently, the insurance giants saw Obamacare as a cash cow. They are now finding the law\u2019s insurance marketplaces to be sickly quagmires causing billions in losses. \u2026United Healthcare, the nation\u2019s largest insurer, last week announced it was suffering huge losses in the exchanges. \u2026The company forecast $700 million in losses on the exchanges. Fellow insurance giant Aetna also said it expected to lose money on the exchanges, and other insurers said enrollment was lower than they expected.\n\nThis seems like a feel-good story, very appropriate for the holidays. After all, companies that get in bed with big government deserve bad consequences.\n\nBut hold on to your wallet.\n\n\u2026ObamaCare insiders \u2014 the wealthy and powerful operatives who alternate between top government jobs and top industry jobs \u2014 are hustling to find more bailout money for insurers. Republicans, if they are able to hold their ground in the face of lobbyist pressure, can block the bailout of ObamaCare and its corporate clientele. \u2026ObamaCare included\u2026a three-year safety net for insurers who do much worse than expected, paid for by an extra tax on insurers who do much better. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) had announced in October that insurers losses for 2014 entitled them to $2.87 billion in bailout payments\u2026 The problem is that super-profitable insurers did not pay nearly that much into the bailout fund.\n\nThis means there will be a fight in Washington. The Obama White House wants to bail out its corporate cronies. But there\u2019s not enough money in the bailout fund.\n\nAnd, thanks to Senator Rubio of Florida, the government can\u2019t write checks out of thin air.\n\nIn late 2014, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., inserted into the so-called Cromnibus spending bill a provision that prohibited CMS from paying out more in risk corridor payments than it takes in. Profitable insurers \u2014 not taxpayers \u2014 must subsidize their less profitable peers.\n\nUnfortunately, the Obama Administration oftentimes doesn\u2019t care what the law says.\n\nCMS announced last week that the government was going to find a way to pay the insurers their full bailout, anyway. \u2026CMS also declared the unfunded portion of ObamaCare\u2019s initial promised insurer bailout was nevertheless an \u201cobligation of the United States Government for which full payment is required,\u201d even though at least under the current appropriation law it is illegal.\n\nTim outlines the incestuous relationship between Big Insurance and the Obama White House, all of which makes for nauseating reading.\n\nBut here\u2019s the part that matters for public policy.\n\nRubio\u2019s provision\u2026expires along with the current government funding law on December 11. The ObamaCare insiders, led by Slavitt and Tavenner, will fight to free up their bailouts and put the taxpayers on the hook for their losses caused by the law they supported.\n\nIn other words, we\u2019re about to see \u2013 as part of upcoming appropriations legislation \u2013 if Republicans have the intelligence and fortitude to retain Rubio\u2019s anti-bailout provision.\n\nThis should be a slam-dunk issue. After all, the American people presumably will not favor bailouts for corrupt health insurance corporations.\n\nEspecially since ObamaCare is still very unpopular.\n\nBut what if Obama says \u201cboo\u201d and threatens to veto spending legislation if it doesn\u2019t give him carte blanche bailout authority? Will GOPers be so scared of a partial government shutdown that they instantly surrender?\n\nAfter all, when there was a shutdown fight in 2013, Republicans suffered a horrible defeat in the 2014 mid-term elections. Right? Isn\u2019t that what happened?\n\nOh\u2026wait\u2026never mind.\n\nP.S. Let\u2019s not forget that there is one very tiny segment of America that has unambiguously benefited from ObamaCare.\n\nP.P.S. If you have any friends who work for the corrupt health insurance companies that are worried about a potential loss of bailout money, you can cheer them up this Christmas season with some great \u2013 and very appropriate \u2013 action figure toys.\n\nP.P.P.S.
