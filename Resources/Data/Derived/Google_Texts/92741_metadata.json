And it usually happens for reasons that could not have been predicted.\n\nCase in point: only a month ago, the reckless shutdown of the federal government left its engineers - the tea party and the Republican Party - weakened, and the president and Democrats energized and with the wind at their back.\n\nAnd beyond Washington, the people's movement in the shutdown's wake was energized too.\n\nBut this newly acquired momentum turned out to be far more momentary than most anticipated, myself included. In fact, it lasted only a few days. Why? Because Republicans seized the opportunity provided by the big problems with the rollout of the Affordable Health Care Act. They were all over it...\n\nLiterally, overnight the atmosphere changed for the worse. President Obama and Democrats, rather than riding a wave, found themselves on the defensive. And the Republicans' shutdown disaster became a distant memory.\n\nSo stop grumbling comrades, and get back on the attack.\n\nNow, if the health insurance exchanges are running smoothly by the end of the year, as they appear to be in many states, much of the furor will die out. But if they aren't, Obamacare will be turned by the far right into a metaphor for \"broken government\" and the prospects of unseating Republicans in Congress and statehouses next fall will become problematic.\n\nWhich means that grumbling about the problems of the health care rollout heard in some progressive and left circles needs to give way to actively resisting the right wing's campaign to kill Obamacare and regain the initiative leading into the midterm and 2016 elections.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2013/12/top_american_communist_speaks_out_on_obamacare.html", "image": "http://www.americanthinker.com/legacy_assets/blog/assets/CPUSAconfWEBB400x300-300x225-150x150.jpg", "title": "Blog: Top American communist speaks out on Obamacare"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0bca\"", "article_summary": "He also understands the incredible power of the Tea Party - more I suspect, than they do themselves:It is amazing how fast momentum can shift in politics.\nAnd the Republicans' shutdown disaster became a distant memory.\nBecause Republicans seized the opportunity provided by the big problems with the rollout of the Affordable Health Care Act.\nHe's urging his troops to not allow that to happen, by covering for Obamacare's glaring flaws and talking racism.\nBut if they aren't, Obamacare will be turned by the far right into a metaphor for \"broken government\" and the prospects of unseating Republicans in Congress and statehouses next fall will become problematic."}
