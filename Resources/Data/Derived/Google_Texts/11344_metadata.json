Without any assistance from the state, the struggle for many Alexandrians has potential to grow into a city-wide moral and financial crisis. In response, Mayor William Euille has established a Special Advisory Panel on the Health Care Needs of the Uninsured.\n\n\u201cThe Virginia Assembly refused to address this, so now 270,000 Virginians are too poor for the Affordable Care act and too rich for Medicaid,\u201d said Committee Chairman Dan Hawkins. \u201cMany of these people are too poor to receive benefits .\u2026 Our task is to grapple with that in a feasible and affordable way.\u201d\n\nTuesday, Feb. 3 in the City Council Workroom was the committee's second meeting. So far, the panel is the only one of its kind in Virginia dedicated to finding a local solution to the statewide lack of healthcare funding.\n\n\u201cWe just started, and we\u2019re struggling to define the problem,\u201d Hawkins said, but everyone on the committee seems to agree, at least, that there is a problem. \u201cThere is a huge body of data that shows the poor lack access to care, they get sicker, and cost more to care for.\u201d\n\nPart of the frustrations encountered by the committee is that federal tax dollars go to support comprehensive healthcare programs in other states while Virginia has no such program. For Richard Merritt, a member of the panel, that means watching as people with the same level of poverty as many Alexandrians are treated across the Potomac in Maryland and Washington D.C.\n\nFor Hawkins, it\u2019s more than a moral problem for the city, it is very quickly becoming an economic one.\n\n\u201cWhen folks don\u2019t get access to care, like regular checkups or screenings, they end up costing more money in the emergency room,\u201d said Hawkins, quoting a 1972 oil filter advertisement \u201c\u2019You can pay me now, or you can pay me later.\u2019\u201d\n\nAs the group begins to look for solutions to the uninsured crisis, one of the main challenges will be strict resource limitations. With the city anticipating a budget shortfall to work around, Hawkins is uncertain about the City Council\u2019s potential willingness to fund a new program. But sooner or later, Hawkins says, it\u2019s a cost the city is going to face. According to Hawkins, the longer it takes to address that, the more costly it will be.\n\nOne of the panel specialists, Mary Anne Weber, said one of the other problems the committee is likely to face is a lack of medical care available, particularly for those suffering from mental health issues.\n\n\u201cThere are not enough hospital beds in communities, and these people shouldn\u2019t have to be shipped off to state institutions,\u201d said Weber. \u201cAll of the data we have says people recover better in their own communities.\u201d\n\nBasim Khan, the interim executive director and medical director for Neighborhood Health, formerly Alexandria Neighborhood Health Services Inc., said another major problem the group will have to contend with is a lack of specialty care. Finding specialty care for many chronic diseases can already be difficult. For those without insurance, it can be almost impossible.\n\n\u201cPatients without insurance will have to go to the University of Virginia or Richmond for specialty care,\u201d said Khan. \u201cFor people working daily, that\u2019s a big cost.\u201d\n\nMerritt, former chair of the Alexandria Public Health Advisory Commission, said the first step in helping to secure resources to combat the lack of healthcare is dispelling the untrue assumptions about Alexandria\u2019s uninsured.\n\n\u201cThere are myths about who the uninsured are,\u201d said Merritt, primarily that those who are uninsured are also unemployed. \u201cSeventy percent of people who are uninsured are working either part or full time and their employer either can\u2019t or won\u2019t provide them health care benefits.\u201d\n\nThe second myth, Merritt said, is that Alexandria\u2019s \u201cstrong safety net\u201d will take care of those with medical issues who don\u2019t have insurance.\n\n\u201cWe do have a strong safety net,\u201d said Merritt, \u201cbut that doesn\u2019t provide at all for primary or specialty care.\u201d\n\nAfter the panel argues for whatever resources they can get from the city, Hawkins says they\u2019ll be put in the uncomfortable position of establishing priorities within the uninsured community.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll take those at highest risk, namely with more than one disease, and we\u2019ll look for the highest number of chronic conditions,\u201d said Hawkins, noting that diabetes and high blood pressure can often be accompanied by depression, and vice versa. Weber added that depression medicine can sometimes directly lead to diabetes or high blood pressure.\n\nBut there is also a careful balance the group will have to strike in its prioritization. The group will also have to provide some level of regular care to those at low risk in the community to keep them from becoming high risk patients.\n\nA few programs already exist in Virginia to help those in need of medical attention. One, the Governor\u2019s Access Plan (GAP), is a pilot project for those suffering from serious mental illnesses that gets health care access to those who don\u2019t otherwise qualify for Medicaid. To receive GAP benefits, an adult citizen must be between 21 and 64 with no health insurance, a household below 100 percent of federal poverty level ($11,670 per year for a single adult) who is no longer residing in a long term care, mental health, or penal facility. Applicants must also go through a screening process to meet the criteria for serious mental illnesses.\n\nEnroll Virginia also helps local citizens discover if they qualify for healthcare coverage and, if they don\u2019t, where they can go for treatment. Enroll Virginia assists all uninsured individuals enroll in affordable health insurance programs for free and provides in-person assistance with enrollment at businesses and community organizations. The deadline for special enrollment to receive tax credits is Feb. 15.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.connectionnewspapers.com/news/2015/feb/04/too-poor-benefits-alexandria/", "type": "article", "title": "Too Poor for Benefits in Alexandria"}, "description": "An estimated 5,000 people living in Alexandria are without access to healthcare.
