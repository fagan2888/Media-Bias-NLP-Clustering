Clinton\u2019s command of the stage has intensified the pressure on Biden to declare his intentions \u2014 either mount a late run for the nomination or say it ain\u2019t a go, Joe, and get out of her way.\n\nBut the Clinton camp may be ignoring a sleeper who has been handed a stack of reasons to join the fray by candidates as far apart as Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders. And the CNN debate in Las Vegas added another prod that could prompt this undeclared candidate to come out of the shadows.\n\nRelated: The Coming Danger of the \u2018Throw the Bums Out\u2019 2016 Election\u200b\u200b\n\nAs a senator, Clinton was once a reliable vote for the New York financial community (daughter Chelsea even worked for the hedge fund Avenue Capital for three years). But as Clinton gets shoved left by the rein-in-the-rich voices of Sanders and Martin O\u2019Malley, she will have to bail on the too-big-to-fail crowd if she wants to win the support of Elizabeth Warren progressives. So the banks and the Street will need another hero.\n\nEnter Mike Bloomberg?\n\nRumors of a run for the presidency by the former New York City mayor have floated around for years and surfaced again in recent months in USA Today and the New York Post (both pieces tamped down by New York Magazine). Frequently these floaters have been punctured by the argument that a brash, super-rich, divorced, Jewish New Yorker who thinks big and is unafraid to speak his mind and crunch a few toes would have little chance on the national stage. But the Trump Tornado that roared across the country last summer has, despite losing some force in some polls lately, flattened those electorate assumptions one after another. And the surprising Sanders surge has crushed a few others.\n\nThe thrice-married Trump has made inroads with the Christian Right, for example, and his loudmouth, New Yawky persona is playing well in Iowa, where he still retains a 5.6-point lead among Republican voters, according to the Real Clear Politics poll average.\n\nRelated: Why Trump is So Dangerous for the GOP in 2016\n\nCertainly, Bloomberg is no Trump.\n\nHe\u2019s not bombastic (though he can be sarcastic).\n\nHe\u2019s not an obvious self-promoter (though he doesn\u2019t have a problem taking a bow and after 12 years of running the highest-profile city in the world, he is a polished performer).\n\nHe\u2019s not an outsider in this season of the non-pol that has seen the rise of Trump, Ben Carson and Carly Fiorina (though he isn\u2019t a rubber-mouthed, career politician either).\n\nAnd he\u2019s not an unabashed egotist (through he was self-impressed enough to change the law so he could grab a third term and he, too, likes to put his name on things: Bloomberg LP, Bloomberg Media, Bloomberg Markets, Bloomberg Businessweek, Bloomberg Politics, Bloomberg View and, of course, The Bloomberg \u2014 the financial data terminal that has made him a billionaire. (Full disclosure: I worked for Bloomberg Businessweek for about a year.)\n\nIf it\u2019s a rich guy voters want, Bloomberg is almost 10 times wealthier than Trump, who likes to emphasize his worth by holding press conferences in the glitzy Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue. Forbes just pegged Trump\u2019s fortune at $4.5 billion (a number he vociferously contests as too low); it said Bloomberg is worth $38.6 billion.\n\nRelated: Mark Cuban Says He\u2019d Crush Trump\u200b\u200b\n\nAnd Bloomberg isn\u2019t afraid to spend his cash in pursuit of public office. According to a 2009 story in The New York Times, he was on track to drop $110 million to $140 million on his last re-election campaign, and in toto spent about $250 million on his three mayoral bids. Plus, if Forbes is correct, Bloomberg is more than twice as wealthy now as he was back then.\n\nIf it\u2019s a successful businessperson voters want, Bloomberg easily bests Trump (and Fiorina). Trump has skirted financial disaster more than once, while Bloomberg LP has never faltered since its inception.\n\nIf it\u2019s a candidate with strong views voters want, Bloomberg, the man who banned smoking in almost every public nook of New York, who went after sugary drinks, who tried to restrict traffic in Midtown Manhattan, and who has been a major national force for gun control is every bit as opinionated as Trump.\n\nAnd for voters of either party eager for a candidate who hates losing enough to do almost anything to win, Mayor Mike can go mano a mano with The Donald (apologies for the Spanish, Mr. Trump) all day long.\n\nRelated: Trump Explains What Would Get Him Out of the Presidential Race\u200b\u200b\u200b\n\nAs a Democrat turned Republican turned independent, Bloomberg, like Trump, isn\u2019t a slave any label except his own. He could run for the GOP nomination, which would be unlikely given his positions on gun control and abortion, or he could mount a third-party bid. But he would probably be most comfortable going after the Democratic nomination, like another independent, the Vermont socialist Senator Sanders.\n\nBesides demonstrating the irrelevance of party affiliation, Bernie has also shown that being Jewish and a relatively old guy are not necessarily impediments to a 2016 presidential aspirant: Sanders is 74; Bloomberg is 73.\n\nA recent Pew national poll showing Trump favored by 25 percent of those Republicans surveyed suggests that his lead is largely driven by a hard-line position on illegal immigration.\n\nIf immigration becomes one of the defining issues of the national race, not just the primary contest, the Bloomberg View, which rejects Trump\u2019s send-\u2018em-all-home stance and posits reforms that put the U.S. economy first, might be appealing to swing voters and even some moderate Republicans.\n\nRelated: Why Donald Trump Is Vladimir Putin\u2019s Favorite Presidential Candidate\u200b\u200b\n\nAnd if Biden still has time to make a credible run for the nomination, so does Bloomberg. He may not have anywhere near the cross-the-country political connections of the vice president, but he has probably spread enough financial support around to call in some political IOUs. In addition, he has operatives who know how to run a campaign, like Kevin Sheekey, head of communications, public policy and marketing at Bloomberg LP, who oversaw Bloomberg\u2019s three successful campaigns for mayor.\n\nOn Sept. 22, the 2016 campaign-manager-in-waiting tweeted: \u201cI can\u2019t be the only one who wishes Michael Bloomberg would enter the race, can I?\u201d\n\nMore important, money would be no object.\n\nAs employees of Bloomberg LP would confirm, if they weren\u2019t afraid of being shown the door of company headquarters in the Bloomberg Tower (wouldn\u2019t a race from dueling towers be fun?), the mayor isn\u2019t ready to retire.\n\nSince he returned to the business that bears his name, Bloomberg hasn\u2019t exactly been a passive owner. He\u2019s taken the reins from CEO Dan Doctoroff, a onetime deputy mayor and confidant, and pushed aside Bloomberg News chief Matt Winkler, who co-wrote his autobiography, Bloomberg by Bloomberg, and was thought to be as entrenched as barbed wire sunk in concrete atop a 10-foot wall.\n\nBoth moves were surprising, given Bloomberg LP\u2019s obsession with loyalty. But they revealed one more way that Bloomberg one-ups Trump: He\u2019s more unpredictable than the predictably unpredictable Donald.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Joe Biden has been spooking the Clinton campaign by pulling on his can", "title": "How Trump and Sanders May Be Paving a Path for Bloomberg 2016", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/18/How-Trump-and-Sanders-May-Be-Paving-Path-Bloomberg-2016", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/09282011_Bloomberg_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/18/How-Trump-and-Sanders-May-Be-Paving-Path-Bloomberg-2016", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/09282011_Bloomberg_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Joe Biden has been spooking the Clinton campaign by pulling on his can", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "And he\u2019s not an unabashed egotist (through he was self-impressed enough to change the law so he could grab a third term and he, too, likes to put his name on things: Bloomberg LP, Bloomberg Media, Bloomberg Markets, Bloomberg Businessweek, Bloomberg Politics, Bloomberg View and, of course, The Bloomberg \u2014 the financial data terminal that has made him a billionaire.\nRelated: Why Trump is So Dangerous for the GOP in 2016Certainly, Bloomberg is no Trump.\nBut they revealed one more way that Bloomberg one-ups Trump: He\u2019s more unpredictable than the predictably unpredictable Donald.\nRelated: Trump Explains What Would Get Him Out of the Presidential Race\u200b\u200b\u200bAs a Democrat turned Republican turned independent, Bloomberg, like Trump, isn\u2019t a slave any label except his own.\nIf it\u2019s a successful businessperson voters want, Bloomberg easily bests Trump (and Fiorina)."}
