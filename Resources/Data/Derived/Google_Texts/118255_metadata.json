While this is a more roundabout way of getting it through (in comparison to the \"hot line\" process that requires all Senators to agree to passage, and Senator Cruz opposed), the likelihood of the Omnibus bill passing in some version is high, and the expatriate provisions are not expected to hinder it. Greg has spoken with the Cigna folks in DC today and said they are pleased. So, while we're not out of the woods yet, prospects for getting the expat fix made are now very good.\u201d\n\nThe waiver is sought for large insurance companies including Cigna who have a sizable expatriate customer base overseas that will be impacted by Obamacare starting January 2015. The health care law requires certain mandates that foreign competitors don\u2019t have to comply with.The waiver would affect plans that cover people working outside their home country, including foreign employees working in America or Americans working abroad.\n\nCigna says they have about one million Americans who work overseas and get their care there that will be subject to rules like free preventive care that foreign-based insurance plans don\u2019t have to offer.
