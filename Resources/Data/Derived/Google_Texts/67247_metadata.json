Billionaire businessman Donald Trump has the money to fund his own campaign and is using it. He is the clear front-runner in opinion polls for the Republican presidential nomination.\n\nStrengths: He has tapped into the anti-Washington, anti-immigrant strain of the Republican Party.\n\nWeaknesses: His comments have also turned off large elements of the GOP electorate.
