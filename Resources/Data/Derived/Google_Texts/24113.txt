As you probably know by now, Obamacare imposes a penalty on individuals who fail to have a certain level of health insurance coverage for any month of the year. This requirement is commonly called the individual mandate, and the penalty is the cost of noncompliance.

The bad news is the penalty can be considerably more expensive in 2016. If you don’t yet have coverage for next year, you may need to quickly sign up to avoid getting socked with the penalty.

The Obamacare open enrollment period starts on Nov. 1. Here’s the rest of what you need to know.

Penalty basics

Unless you are exempt, you will owe the penalty if you do not have minimum essential coverage for yourself and your dependents. Minimum essential coverage includes certain government sponsored programs (such as Medicare, Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and TRICARE), eligible employer-sponsored plans, plans obtained in the individual marketplace, certain grandfathered group plans, and certain other coverage specified by the Feds. However, if you fit into one of the following categories, you will be exempt from the penalty for next year.

• Your 2016 household income is below the federal income tax return filing threshold (generally $10,350 for singles, $20,700 for married joint-filing couples, and $13,350 for heads of households).

• You are considered to lack access to affordable minimum essential coverage. For example, coverage under an employer-sponsored plan is considered unaffordable if your required monthly contribution for self-only coverage exceeds 9.56% of household income.

• You suffered a hardship in obtaining coverage. To qualify for this exception, you should obtain a hardship exception certificate issued by the health insurance marketplace that operates in your state.

• You have only a short-term coverage gap.

• You qualify for an exception on religious grounds or have coverage through a health-care sharing ministry.

• You are not a U.S. citizen or national.

• You are incarcerated.

• You are a member of an Indian tribe.

Penalty specifics

If you owe the penalty, the tentative amount equals the greater of the following two prongs:

1. The applicable percentage of your household income above the federal income tax return filing threshold or

2. The applicable dollar amount times the number of uninsured individuals in your household, limited to 300% of the applicable dollar amount.

The final penalty amount cannot exceed the national average cost of “bronze coverage” (the cheapest category of Obamacare-compliant coverage) for your household. For 2015, the national average cost for bronze coverage is $207 per person per month or $1,035 per month for a family of five or more. The 2016 national averages for bronze coverage probably won’t be revealed until early next year, but the numbers will be only slightly higher than the 2015 amounts.

Meanwhile, the important thing to know is that a higher-income person or household could owe more than 300% of the applicable dollar amount but not more than the cost of bronze coverage.

Confusing? You bet. But please hang in there, because things will soon become clearer.

Percentage of income prong

The applicable percentage of income is 2.5% for 2016 (it was only 2% for 2015).

Dollar amount prong

The applicable dollar amount for each uninsured household member is $695 for 2016. For 2017 and beyond, it will be $695 adjusted for inflation. (For 2015, the applicable dollar amount was only $325.) For an under-age-18 household member, the applicable dollar amounts are cut by 50%. As stated earlier, this prong of the penalty cannot exceed 300% of the applicable dollar amount (determined without regard to the 50% cutback for under-age-18 individuals) for the year in question.

Final penalty amount

As stated earlier, the tentative penalty amount is the greater of the percentage of income prong or the dollar amount prong.

But the final penalty amount is limited to the national average cost of bronze coverage. If you have minimum essential coverage for only part of the year, the penalty is calculated on a monthly basis using pro-rated annual figures.

Here are some examples

As you can see, the individual mandate penalty rules are pretty complicated. The following examples illustrate how to calculate the penalty for 2016 in the two simplest situations.

• Example 1: One-person household with no coverage for entire year

Say you are unmarried and live alone. During all of 2016, you have no minimum essential coverage. Your income for the year is $100,000. Your tax return filing threshold for the year is $10,350. Assume the monthly national average premium for bronze coverage for one person is $215 for 2016, which amounts to $2,580 for the entire year (12 x $215).

In your case, the percentage of income prong for 2016 is $2,241 [($100,000-$10,350) x 2.5%].The dollar amount prong is $695. The tentative penalty amount is $2,241 (greater of $2,241 or $695).

As stated, the annual national average cost of bronze coverage is assumed to be $2,580 for one person who is uncovered for all of 2016.

Therefore, your final penalty amount for failing to comply with the individual mandate is $2,241 (lesser of $2,241 or $2,580).

• Example 2: Family of five with no coverage for entire year

Say you are a married joint filer with three under-age-19 kids. During all of 2016, no member of your family has minimum essential coverage. Your household income for the year is $100,000. Your tax return filing threshold for the year is $20,700. Assume the 2016 national average premium for bronze coverage for a family of five is $1,075 per month, or $12,900 if you have no coverage for the entire year.

In your case, the percentage of income penalty prong is $1,983 [($100,000-$20,700) x 2.5%].

The dollar amount penalty prong is $2,085, which is the lesser of: (1) [($695 x 2 for the adults) + ($695/2 x 3 for the kids) = $2,433] or (2) ($695 x 300% = $2,085).

The tentative penalty amount is $2,085 (greater of $1,983 or $2,085).

The final penalty amount is $2,085 (lesser of $2,085 or the $12,900 cost of bronze coverage).

Know this: Penalty enforcement is lacking

You are supposed to pay any penalty you owe with your Form 1040 for the year. So the penalty for 2016 would be reported on your 2016 return which you will file sometime in 2017. However, the only enforcement mechanism is that the government can subtract any unpaid penalty from your federal income tax refunds. So if you’re not owed a refund for 2016 or a later year, there will never be any consequences for not paying the penalty. You are not subject to criminal prosecution, and the IRS cannot put a lien or levy on your income or assets.

The bottom line

As you can see, failure to have minimum essential health coverage for next year can be an expensive proposition due to the individual mandate penalty. However, for all you Obamacare scofflaws out there, the offsetting consideration is the weak enforcement mechanism for actually collecting the penalty.
