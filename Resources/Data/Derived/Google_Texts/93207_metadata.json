Martinez, whose name has been changed to protect his identity, doesn\u2019t know how long he had the virus before his diagnosis. HCV often remains asymptomatic until its late stages, and it had been many years since he had last seen a doctor. The virus was discovered during intake at Hampden County Correctional Center, a jail in western Massachusetts, where he has been an inmate since April 2013. Ad Policy\n\nMartinez looked much older than his 57 years. Wearing a green jumpsuit and government-issued sneakers, he sat as one of the jail\u2019s doctors, Thomas Lincoln, asked him if anything had changed since the last time they saw each other. \u201cI put on weight,\u201d Martinez said in a raspy voice. \u201cYou told me to!\u201d They both laugh.\n\nLincoln looked over Martinez\u2019s file and glanced at a flat screen monitor displaying an electronic version. \u201cYou\u2019ll be out in August?\u201d he asked. Martinez nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s about time we\u2019ll need to check your blood again.\u201d\n\nMartinez is one of ten million people who enter the local jail system each year in the United States. In contrast to prisons, jails are used to detain people for short-term sentences and low-level offenses, or while awaiting trial for a more serious charge. The average stay in jail is three months and 96 percent of inmates return directly back to their community. Of the more than 1,400 inmates at Hampden, where Martinez was detained, somewhere between 20 and 30 percent carry the HCV virus. Many, like Martinez, are first diagnosed in jail.\n\nAs the US incarceration rate has skyrocketed over the last forty years, many healthcare professionals have come to recognize that jails offer an opportunity to identify and treat people who might not otherwise seek or have access to healthcare. \u201cWith more than 2.2 million men and women and children behind bars, the health of prisoners and jail detainees and the health of the public is becoming blurred,\u201d says Gabriel Eber, staff counsel at the ACLU\u2019s National Prison Project.\n\nJail inmates are disproportionately male, people of color and poor. This population suffers from higher rates of many health problems, including chronic and infectious disease, injuries, mental illness and substance abuse. And people are often at their sickest when detained. Eighty percent of detained individuals with a chronic medical condition have not received treatment in the community prior to arrest. \u201cIt\u2019s like an emergency room,\u201d says Ben Butler of Community Oriented Correctional Health Services (COCHS), a nonprofit promoting healthcare connectivity between jails and communities, of jail intake. In effect, jails have become the front line for health problems that plague underserved communities in America.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/jail_ap_img_0-275x173.jpg", "sailthru.author": "Maura Ewing", "description": "Jails have become the frontline for health problems that plague underserved communities in America.
