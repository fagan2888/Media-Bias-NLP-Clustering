Or if you\u2019ve already filed taxes and are getting a refund, consider putting some of that windfall into an IRA for 2015.\n\nThe biggest benefit of an IRA, which you can set up with just about any bank, brokerage of mutual fund, is the favorable tax treatment. In a traditional IRA you get a tax break now on the money you deposit, which then grows tax-free. A Roth IRA allows you to put in after-tax money now, but you won\u2019t have to pay taxes on the withdrawals you make in retirement.\n\n\u201cEvery opportunity should be taken to grow money tax-free or tax-deferred where possible,\u201d says Lee Frush, a certified financial planner with Cornerstone Financial.\n\nRelated: 8 Smart Ways to Lower Your Taxes in Retirement\n\nBeyond helping cut your tax bill, IRAs are a smart financial move for anyone serious about retirement planning. Still, while the accounts may be a favorite among financial planners, they\u2019re less popular among the general public. A recent survey by TIAA-CREF found that few Americans place a priority on putting money into an IRA.\n\nThe survey found a lack of understanding of how an IRA can be an important component of any retirement plan. Among those in the poll who weren\u2019t contributing to an IRA and said they wouldn\u2019t use one as part of their retirement strategy, 39 percent admitted they don\u2019t know enough about the accounts to consider one.\n\n\u201cAmericans are missing out on the importance of an IRA because many don\u2019t understand that they have investment options,\u201d says Margie Shard, president and wealth advisor with Shard Financial Services in Fenton, Michigan. \u201cThey also don\u2019t understand investing, so it\u2019s easier to spend their money on vacation and appliances.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to know:\n\nThere are limits: For 2014 and 2015, individuals under age 50 can contribute $5,500 a year to an IRA. Those age 50-70 \u00bd can put in an extra $1,000 in. Everyone\u2019s earnings grow tax-free, but your ability to deduct the contributions from your taxes depends on whether you have a retirement plan at work and your total income.\n\nThe IRA deduction for 2015 phases out for those with a workplace retirement account with incomes between $61,000 and $71,000 for single taxpayers, and between $98,000 and $118,000 for joint filers.\n\nFor Roth IRA contributions in 2015, the deduction phases out for single filers with adjusted gross income between $116,000 and $131,000, and for married couples with adjusted gross income of $183,000 to $193,000.\n\nRelated: Watch that Free Money for IRA Rollovers\n\nYou can contribute to both a 401(k) and an IRA: If you\u2019ve got a workplace retirement plan like a 401(k), you may not be able to deduct your contributions, but if you\u2019ve maxed out your 401(k), stashing extra retirement cash in an IRA account may still be worth it since your earnings there would be tax-deferred. More than 80 percent of households with an IRA in 2014 also had an employer-sponsored plan, according to the Investment Company Institute.\n\nThey\u2019re more flexible than 401(k)s: Since you decide where to invest your money, IRAs offer far more options than 401(k) plans dictated by your company. Often investors \u2014 especially those making last-minute contributions for tax reasons \u2014 don\u2019t take full advantage of those investments. A Vanguard report last year found that during tax season, investors tend to stash money in money market accounts, which have paltry returns. If you don\u2019t have the time or inclination to research the best funds, consider putting your money into what\u2019s known as a target-date fund, which will automatically diversify and rebalance the account for you over time.\n\nTapping them early can be costly: With a traditional IRA, taking money out before age 59 \u00bd will land you a 10 percent penalty, in addition to taxes on earnings for an early withdrawal. Protect yourself by building up an emergency fund with three to six months worth of expenses before putting all your savings into an IRA. That way you have cash you can access without consequence if an unexpected outlay pops up.\n\nRelated: The Worst States for Retirement in 2015\u200b\n\nFor those who are eligible, investing in a Roth IRA might be the better move if you don\u2019t have an emergency fund. During the contribution phase, you can access what you have put into your Roth without penalty. \u201cThis is a nice feature for younger investors looking for liquidity in their investments,\u201d says Mark Zoril, founder of PlanVision, which helps employers manage retirement plans.\n\nMaking withdrawals requires planning: Once you reach age 59 \u00bd, you can take distributions from your IRA. By age 70 \u00bd, you must withdraw the required minimum from your traditional IRA and 401(k) accounts each year or face penalties of 50 percent of the amount you failed to withdraw. Your required minimum distribution changes every year based on your life expectancy (according to the IRS) and account balance; usually your account provider will make the calculation for you.\n\nYou\u2019ll owe income taxes on the withdrawals that you make, so it usually makes sense to take money out of taxable accounts on years when your income is lower, such as when you have a lot of deductions like medical expenses or charitable contributions.\n\nYou can convert from a traditional to a Roth, but it can be tricky: In some cases, it makes sense to convert an existing IRA into a Roth so that you can have tax-free income in retirement. There\u2019s no income cap or limit on how much money investors can convert, but you must pay taxes on the amount converted and wait a minimum of five years before making a withdrawal in order to avoid a penalty.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "You\u2019ve got less than two weeks left to take action on one of the few tax moves", "title": "IRAs: Everything You Need to Know for 2015", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/02/IRAs-Everything-You-Need-Know-2015", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02162010_IRA_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/02/IRAs-Everything-You-Need-Know-2015", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02162010_IRA_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "You\u2019ve got less than two weeks left to take action on one of the few tax moves", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Or if you\u2019ve already filed taxes and are getting a refund, consider putting some of that windfall into an IRA for 2015.\nThe IRA deduction for 2015 phases out for those with a workplace retirement account with incomes between $61,000 and $71,000 for single taxpayers, and between $98,000 and $118,000 for joint filers.\nA Roth IRA allows you to put in after-tax money now, but you won\u2019t have to pay taxes on the withdrawals you make in retirement.\nFor Roth IRA contributions in 2015, the deduction phases out for single filers with adjusted gross income between $116,000 and $131,000, and for married couples with adjusted gross income of $183,000 to $193,000.\nIn a traditional IRA you get a tax break now on the money you deposit, which then grows tax-free."}
