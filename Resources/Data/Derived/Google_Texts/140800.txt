Pope Francis' recent visit to the United States not only put the pontiff in the spotlight but also called attention to Catholic sisters in the U.S.

During a virtual audience, the pope said to Sister Norma Pimentel in Texas that he wanted "to thank all the sisters of religious order in the U.S. for the work that you have done," adding, "I love you all very much," according to an ABC News report.

Among the other sisters monitoring his visit was a group of Bernadine Franciscans in Berks County, Penn., who fixed "pope-corn" and "papal punch" and watched live-streamed coverage from Philadelphia at their home.

At that same time in Kentucky, the Ursuline Sisters of Mount Saint Joseph at Maple Mount, Ky., in Daviess County near Owensboro, were recognizing 19 of their sisters who are celebrating 70-, 60- and 50-year jubilees of service — including a dozen who have ministered in Louisville or are Louisville natives.

History

The Mount Saint Joseph community traces its roots to five Ursuline Sisters from Louisville who arrived in what is now Maple Mount in 1874 to start Mount Saint Joseph Academy, according to Dan Heckel, director of mission advancement and communications at Mount Saint Joseph.

Some academy graduates joined the Louisville Ursulines, but in 1912 sisters in Maple Mount received approval from Rome to become the autonomous Mount St. Joseph community.

The Louisville Ursulines had come from Bavaria in the 1850s and spoke German. An English-speaking novitiate, quarters for religious novices, had been started in Maple Mount in 1895.

Past pope

On May 14, 1981, the Louisville Times ran a front page photo by Keith Williams of Louisville Ursuline Sister Hermina Miltonberger praying after joining other nuns in a service for then-Pope John Paul II that morning at the Ursuline Motherhouse chapel on Lexington Road in Crescent Hill.

The pope had been shot during an assassination attempt two days before at St. Peter's Square in Vatican City, and the sisters were giving thanks that he had survived, The Times said.

Sister Angelice Seibert

On Dec. 4, 1957, The Times featured a story about Louisville Ursuline Sister and Ph.D.: Angelice Seibert, a biochemistry, physiology and anatomy teacher and also a researcher and chairwoman of the division of natural sciences at Ursuline College on Lexington, now the site of Sacred Heart Schools.

Seibert, 35, had been awarded a $1,000 grant by the Damon Runyon Cancer Fund to carry on original research she began in 1950.

In her spare time, she also was said to be an enthusiastic tennis player and was pictured playing flute with three others musical sisters — a pianist, singer and guitarist.

Sister Visitor Center

The Mount Saint Joseph Ursuline sisters have continued to serve in Louisville, as well as other places in Kentucky, in Illinois and other states and in Chile.

Heckel said the community has taken over operation of the Sister Visitor Center, 2235 W. Market St. in Portland in Louisville, a ministry of Catholic Charities that helps the poor.

A 2012 C-J photo by Sam Upshaw showed Mount St. Joseph Sister Larraine Lauter at the center, greeting visiting Catholics on a bus tour. Lauter's main ministry is Water With Blessings in Middletown, which raises money to provide water filters and training to impoverished countries, such as Haiti.
