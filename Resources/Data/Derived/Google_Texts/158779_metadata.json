I left to go to school and came back about 25 years ago,\u201d Schoettle said.\n\nSchoettle said while away at school she received a nursing degree and came back to the Portsmouth area during the summers to work as a student nurse.\n\n\u201cAfter getting my medical degree and fellowship in pediatric intensive care, I worked at the children\u2019s hospital in Pittsburgh and at the medical college of Virginia as a pediatric intensivist. I left there to come back here about 25 years ago,\u201d Schoettle said. \u201cI was recruited, because the administration at SOMC wanted to start a women\u2019s and children\u2019s hospital. About two weeks before I came back, the administration changed and that idea was nixed.\u201d\n\nShe returned to the area without a job. She found work in other medical offices.\n\nSchoettle said she helped to start a pediatric clinic in West Portsmouth and has been in private practice for about the last 10 years.\n\nWhen asked what she\u2019s going to miss the most Schoettle, with tears in her eyes responded, \u201cthe kids. I\u2019m taking care of the kids It\u2019s fun to see the next generation growing.\u201d\n\nShe said all of her patients are like family. She said developing relationships that have lasted over the years has been the best part of having her practice.\n\nWhen asked about lasting memories, Schoettle said, \u201cwhen you see a successful intervention that helped a child, or a child that survived a horrible illness or injury and came back to see you, looking fine and healthy. Those kinds of things stick with you,\u201d Schoettle said.\n\nSchoettle said she does not have plans for retirement.\n\n\u201cI might take a few days off. I have not had a vacation in over 10 years,\u201d Schoettle said.\n\nThe practice will officially close at the end of January. Schoettle will stop seeing patients around the 15th of January and then start moving items out of the offices. Letters have been sent to patients informing them of the practice closure.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the end of a cycle, it seems like our lives are in cycles and this is the end of my 20 plus year cycle. We\u2019ll see where I go next and I\u2019m sure where that will lead me,\u201d Schoettle said.\n\nSubmitted Photo Dr. Rebecca Schoettle playing with Raeleigh Hall after an appointment. http://portsmouth-dailytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/web1_11223853-1.jpg Submitted Photo Dr. Rebecca Schoettle playing with Raeleigh Hall after an appointment.\n\nBy Wayne Allen [email protected]\n\nWayne Allen can be reached at 740-353-3101, ext. 1933 or on Twitter @WayneallenPDT\n\nWayne Allen can be reached at 740-353-3101, ext. 1933 or on Twitter @WayneallenPDT\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.\n\nDisqus", "article_metadata": {"geo.region": "US-OH", "DC.language": "en_US", "DC.rights": "Civitas Media", "geo.placename": "Portsmouth", "og": {"site_name": "Portsmouth Daily Times", "description": "Dr. Rebecca Schoettle has announced plans to close her pediatric medical practice by the end of January at Southern Ohio Medical Center (SOMC) and retire.Schoettle said due to increased regulations and equipment upgrades associated with Obamacare, it was no longer financially feasible to keep her practice open.Schoettle said she\u2019s been practicing in the Portsmouth area [...]", "locality": "Portsmouth", "url": "http://portsmouth-dailytimes.com/news/4567/schoettle-to-close-medical-practice", "image": "http://portsmouth-dailytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/web1_11223853-165x300.jpg", "title": "Schoettle to close medical practice", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "region": "US-OH"}, "DC.type": "Text", "twitter": {"image": "http://portsmouth-dailytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/web1_11223853-1.jpg", "site": "@PDTNews", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "- Portsmouth Daily Times - portsmouth-dailytimes.com"}, "DC.format": "text/html", "DC.contributor": "Portsmouth Daily Times", "DC.publisher": "Portsmouth Daily Times", "DC.identifier": "http://portsmouth-dailytimes.com", "DC.relation": "http://dublincore.org/", "theme-color": "#022452", "article": {"section": "News", "published_time": "2015-12-22T16:39:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-22T17:47:01+00:00", "author": "http://portsmouth-dailytimes.com/author/englewoodindependent-2"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "DC.title": "Portsmouth Daily Times, Portsmouth OH - www.portsmouth-dailytimes.com"}, "article_summary": "Dr. Rebecca Schoettle has announced plans to close her pediatric medical practice by the end of January at Southern Ohio Medical Center (SOMC) and retire.\nhttp://portsmouth-dailytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/web1_11223853-1.jpg Submitted Photo Dr. Rebecca Schoettle playing with Raeleigh Hall after an appointment.\nSubmitted Photo Dr. Rebecca Schoettle playing with Raeleigh Hall after an appointment.\nSchoettle said she helped to start a pediatric clinic in West Portsmouth and has been in private practice for about the last 10 years.\nSchoettle said due to increased regulations and equipment upgrades associated with Obamacare, it was no longer financially feasible to keep her practice open."}
