(AP) - Ocean Spray is shooting its signature cranberry commercial in central Wisconsin for the first time.\n\nProduction crews, actors and Ocean Spray employees have been working to shoot a year\u2019s worth of commercials at Beltz Cranberry Co. in Warrens. The Massachusetts-based company only has a small timeframe to create all of the footage it will need since cranberries are harvested in the fall.\n\nOcean Spray has been airing ads that feature two cranberry farmers standing in a bog for 10 years. Its longstanding TV campaign was traditionally shot in the same small cranberry bog in Carver, Massachusetts.\n\nThe commercial needed a \u201clittle freshening up,\u201d Courtney Nunley, who was involved in the shoot as the vice president and marketing director at Arnold Worldwide, told Daily Tribune Media (http://wrtnews.co/1pHTTuJ ). Ocean Spray chose to shoot it in Wisconsin because it produces more cranberries than any other state, she said.\n\n\u201cWe had a desire to shake the campaign up a little bit,\u201d Nunley said.\n\nThe actors will remain the same, but the new backdrop gives the commercial the boost that it needed, according to the advertising agency official.\n\n\u201cThe sky is so much bigger, and the landscape gives us totally different angles,\u201d Nunley said.\n\nThe Wisconsin cranberry marsh is much bigger and flatter than the one that\u2019s appeared in Ocean Spray commercials for years.\n\n\u201cWe were just excited to capture it in a way we hadn\u2019t before,\u201d Nunley said about the campaign.\n\nThe commercials are expected to debut next year.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Daily Tribune Media, http://www.wisconsinrapidstribune.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ocean Spray is shooting its signature cranberry commercial in central Wisconsin for the first time.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Ocean Spray is shooting its signature cranberry commercial in central Wisconsin for the first time.", "title": "Ocean Spray shoots cranberry commercial in Warrens", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/oct/24/ocean-spray-shoots-cranberry-commercial-in-warrens/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/10/24/5724fcb0d6697229630f6a7067001045.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/10/24/5724fcb0d6697229630f6a7067001045.jpg", "description": "Ocean Spray is shooting its signature cranberry commercial in central Wisconsin for the first time.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Ocean Spray shoots cranberry commercial in Warrens"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcea40\"", "article_summary": "WARRENS, Wis.
