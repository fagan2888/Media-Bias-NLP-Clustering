Contraception coverage would be provided by someone in the future -- and they oppose that.\n\n\"The government demands that the Little Sisters of the Poor sign a permission slip for abortion drugs and contraceptives, or pay of millions in fines\" for non-compliance, said Mark Rienzi, senior counsel for the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, the group representing the nuns.\n\n\"The sisters believe that doing that violates their faith, and that they shouldn't be forced to divert funds from the poor elderly and dying people they've devoted their lives to serve,\" Rienzi said.\n\nThe Supreme Court in March will take up a related challenge to the birth control mandate, when it hears arguments over whether some for-profit corporations should be exempt, again on religious liberty grounds.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Obama administration asked the Supreme Court on Friday to keep in place an Obamacare requirement that certain religious-affiliated groups cover birth control and other reproductive health services in their employee insurance plans.", "pubdate": "2014-01-03T15:24:31Z", "author": "By Bill Mears, CNN Supreme Court Producer", "og": {"site_name": "CNN", "description": "The Obama administration asked the Supreme Court on Friday to keep in place an Obamacare requirement that certain religious-affiliated groups cover birth control and other reproductive health services in their employee insurance plans.", "pubdate": "2014-01-03T15:24:31Z", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2014/01/03/politics/supreme-court-obamacare/index.html", "image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/130529131434-seasonale-birth-control-pills-t3-entertainment.jpg", "type": "article"}, "section": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 80401312489}, "thumbnail": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/130529131434-seasonale-birth-control-pills-t3-entertainment.jpg", "source": "CNN", "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.cnn.com/2014/01/03/politics/supreme-court-obamacare/index.html"}, "keywords": "politics, U.S. asks court to preserve Obamacare contraception mandate - CNNPolitics.com", "lastmod": "2014-01-04T00:17:03Z", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb22b\"", "article_summary": "The current case spotlights a major sticking point in the law over contraception coverage.\nContraception coverage would be provided by someone in the future -- and they oppose that.\nJUST WATCHED Fighting the 'contraception mandate' Replay More Videos ...
