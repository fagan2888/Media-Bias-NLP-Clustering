Conrad/The New York Times\n\nPussy Riot members Maria Alyokhina, 25, and Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, 24, visited The New York Times editorial board Wednesday morning. They were on The Colbert Report Tuesday night and will appear at the Barclay\u2019s Center in Brooklyn tonight. This is why they\u2019re getting so much attention.\n\nThey\u2019re not afraid of prison\u2026\n\nJailed in 2012 after staging an anti-Putin protest in a Moscow church and released at the end of last year, the two, known for performing riotous punk ballads in balaclavas, will go back to prison if they have to.\n\nIt\u2019s \u201csilly\u201d to talk of going to prison a second time as \u201csomething that would instill fear in us,\u201d Ms. Alyokhina told The New York Times through an interpreter.\n\n\u2026Even though this was their prison experience.\n\nThe musician-activists detailed their time in separate penal colonies, where they were subject to harsh conditions that harkened back to the Soviet era. \u201cWhen we first arrived at the colony we were struck by how silent everyone was,\u201d Ms. Alyokhina said. \u201cIt was as if people were perfectly satisfied to live in inhumane conditions. But then we understood what was going on. It was the old Soviet method of trying to make everyone in a uniform mass. If you step outside of the swarm you immediately receive punishment.\u201d\n\nMs. Tolokonnikova said that the prison system tried to make \u201cobedient slaves out of prisoners,\u201d forcing them to work 16 to 20 hour days. Punishment included being locked out in the rain and being forbidden from using the bathroom.\n\nThey know firsthand that President Vladimir Putin cares what the West thinks.\n\nMs. Alyokhina and Ms. Tolokonnikova credit their release from prison last year to Western pressure. They urge a boycott of the Sochi Olympics, saying that support of the event indicated support of Mr. Putin\u2019s regime of oppression.\n\nThey say that a run for office is \u201cup to the people.\u201d\n\nThey\u2019ve been urged to run for office, Ms. Alyokhina said, but it\u2019s not up to them, it\u2019s up to the people. Right now, \u201cour task is to unite the people who don\u2019t want to be silent.\u201d\n\nThey were spied on by the Russian government.\n\n\u201cWe were constantly watched. All day long. In Russia, the more they watch you, the harder your life becomes,\u201d Ms. Tolokonnikova said about her experience in prison.\n\nThey\u2019re political activists first, artists second.\n\n\u201cWe always insisted from very beginning that Pussy Riot is a political group that is using art as a means to express its opinion,\u201d Ms. Tolokonnikova said. She added that they attempted to communicate with the government via official channels, but were denied, and so they turned to art in protest.\n\n\u201cWe think that it is necessary to get people\u2019s attention in a loud and scandalous way,\u201d Ms. Alyokhina said.\n\nTheir future is uncertain, and they\u2019re okay with that.\n\nMs. Alyokhina and Ms. Tolokonnikova are dedicating themselves to human rights and political activism. But they say that they can\u2019t plan too far ahead. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d Ms. Alyokhina said. \u201cThe state might have other plans for us.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20140205172727, "BN": "takingnote", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "takingnote", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/takingnote/post", "per": "Putin, Vladimir V", "org": "Pussy Riot", "keywords": "Putin Vladimir V,Pussy Riot,Russia,Featured Posts", "GBLC": "Featured Posts", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/takingnote/Pussy Riot at The New York Times ( 20140205 )", "PT": "Blogs", "author": "Leah Finnegan", "SCG": "takingnote", "sourceApp": "blogs", "CLMST": "Leah Finnegan", "byl": "Leah Finnegan", "twitter": {"url": "http://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/05/pussy-riot-at-the-new-york-times/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "description": "Maria Alyokhina and Nadezhda Tolokonnikova aren\u2019t scared of going back to prison.", "card": "summary", "title": "Pussy Riot at The New York Times"}, "blogpostid": 100000002690800, "description": "Maria Alyokhina and Nadezhda Tolokonnikova aren\u2019t scared of going back to prison.", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "February 5, 2014", "article": {"tag": "Featured Posts", "published_time": 1391639247, "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "modified_time": "2014-02-06T00:49:26-05:00"}, "geo": "Russia", "utime": 20140206004926, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20140205, "pdate": 20140205, "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "Taking Note", "description": "Maria Alyokhina and Nadezhda Tolokonnikova aren\u2019t scared of going back to prison.", "title": "Pussy Riot at The New York Times", "url": "http://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/05/pussy-riot-at-the-new-york-times/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/05/pussy-riot-at-the-new-york-times/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "Pussy Riot at The New York Times", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post", "DISPLAYDATE": "February 5, 2014"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda2f7\"", "article_summary": "Fred R.
