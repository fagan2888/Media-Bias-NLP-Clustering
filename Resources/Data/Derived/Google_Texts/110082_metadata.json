On Monday, Governor Jerry Brown is expected to sign it into law.\n\nLast night, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said he reached a budget deal hiking the minimum to $15 in New York City by the end of 2018. Suburbs and other parts of the state would reach that level in 2021. The combined moves could affect as many as 10 million workers.\n\nBut there are continuing questions about whether that level of wage might have unintended consequences.\n\nWe explore now that with two who watch this closely from different political lenses. David Cooper is with the Economic Policy Institute, and Douglas Holtz-Eakin is with the American Action Forum.\n\nAnd we welcome both of you to the program.\n\nDavid Cooper, to you first.\n\nYou have been watching this issue for a long time, but this has come about pretty suddenly, hasn\u2019t it?\n\nDAVID COOPER, Economic Policy Institute: It has. I don\u2019t think anyone expected both states to move so quickly like this.\n\nOf course, there had been talk in New York of there being some sort of increase to $15. Governor Cuomo talked about it a few weeks ago. And there were these ballots measures moving in California. So we expected there to be some action on the minimum wage in both states, but no one anticipated deals happening twice in one week.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Douglas Holtz-Eakin, I know you have been watching this from your own perspective. What difference do you think this is going to make? Some of this will take effect 2018, 2021, 2022. But what do you see the tangible effects of this?\n\nDOUGLAS HOLTZ-EAKIN, Former Congressional Budget Office Director: Well, we know some of the tangible effects.\n\nThere are going to be some people who get a raise. And that\u2019s the good news part of this. The bad news is, there is no new money to pay someone $15 an hour, and so the money has to come from somewhere. And one of the places it will come from is from those people who would otherwise have gotten hired and won\u2019t now. Our estimates are that could be 700,000 people in California, something like 400,000 people in New York state.\n\nAnd it seems odd to me that we would take money from someone who hasn\u2019t gotten a job to give it to someone who has a job. That\u2019s a problem with the minimum wage.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let me stop on that point.\n\nDavid Cooper, what about that, that not everybody \u2014 yes, some people will get a raise, but other people are going to be hurt by this?\n\nDAVID COOPER: Well, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessarily true.\n\nThe reality is that our failure to raise minimum wages more appropriately over the last 40 years has left low-wage workers in this country earning less today than their counterparts did a generation ago. The bottom 30 percent of American workers today makes less, after you adjust for inflation, than that same group of workers did in the 1960s.\n\nSo, over that time period, we have had tremendous improvements in our ability to generate income, in businesses\u2019 profit-making potential, but workers just haven\u2019t been seeing those benefits because we haven\u2019t been raising minimum wages.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: In other words, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, an element of basic fairness here.\n\nDOUGLAS HOLTZ-EAKIN: It\u2019s not the business community\u2019s job to deliver fairness. It\u2019s the government\u2019s job.\n\nAnd one of the things that is wrong with the minimum wage is that, of the increases that come with going to $15, only 7 percent go to people who are in poverty. It\u2019s very poorly targeted on those who are genuinely in need in the United States.\n\nThere are better approaches, approaches that do not cost jobs, approaches that actually target people in poverty. There are the Earned Income Tax Credit and other such subsidies. We should be focusing on things that are pro-work and targeted on those who have the biggest need.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: What about, David Cooper, the uneven nature of this, the fact, as Douglas Holtz-Eakin is referencing, that some people \u2014 for some people, this will be an appropriate boost, for others, it either won\u2019t be enough or it may be too much if you live in a community where this represents a giant increase?\n\nDAVID COOPER: Well, that\u2019s an interesting question.\n\nI actually do agree with Doug that it\u2019s government\u2019s role to enact policies that bring about fairness. But I would say the minimum wage is one of those policies that government uses to achieve those outcomes.\n\nIn terms of the size of the increase, every study that has looked at increases in the minimum wage has concluded that the group of low-wage workers makes more at the end of the day or at the end of the year than they would have otherwise.\n\nSo, set aside what these effects may be on employment, because, frankly, these increases are larger than most of what has been studied, so I don\u2019t think we can say definitively what those effects will be. But we do know pretty confidently that, at the end of the day, low-wage workers on the whole are going to make a lot more money as a result of this increase.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: And why isn\u2019t that a good thing?\n\nDOUGLAS HOLTZ-EAKIN: If you\u2019re one of the low-wage workers who has a job or keeps a job, that\u2019s great.\n\nBut why would you want to endanger the others and not get them the help when we have other tools that would get them the help? And I think we know that, California, from $10 to $15 is a 50 percent increase, New York state, up to $15, this is \u2014 we\u2019re in uncharted territory. And both states, I think, have acknowledged the reality of how risky this is for their workers, because they have both put in essentially circuit-breakers that say, you know, if we lose employment, if we lose retail sales, this is off.\n\nAnd I think that\u2019s an appropriate recognition of the danger of doing this too quickly and in such a dramatic way.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: It is the case, David Cooper, that both states have put in, if you will, conditions, so that if you get along the road a certain distance and it isn\u2019t benefiting as it should, then they can undo some of this.\n\nDAVID COOPER: Right. Right.\n\nYes, and I think that\u2019s perfectly reasonable, because these are both proposals, these take us out of the experience that we have had in the last few decades in the United States, at least at the national level. But these aren\u2019t that bold, when you look at what other countries have done and even what states have \u2014 where states have been in the United States before.\n\nIn 1980, we had 10 states that had a minimum wage level that was essentially the equivalent of what California is targeting, when you look at the ratio of what minimum wage workers are being tad to what the typical worker is being paid.\n\nOther countries, advanced countries like France have a minimum wage at a comparable level right now. The U.K. has instituted a plan to get to a similar level in a few years. And Australia had a minimum wage at this level back in the 1990s. So, this may be new territory for the United States, but it isn\u2019t like we\u2019re entering into a whole new area.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: What about that?\n\nDOUGLAS HOLTZ-EAKIN: Well, I think the key is that this isn\u2019t the right way to raise wages, right?\n\nWhat we have done to raise wages in the United States traditionally is have tight labor markets. The late \u201990s under President Clinton would be the high watermark for recent years. That\u2019s part of the recovery that we just really haven\u2019t seen. We haven\u2019t seen the tight labor market.\n\nAnd over the longer term, if you have good productivity growth, if you have an economy that has great growth potential, you can give higher wages without having to raise prices or hurt shareholders. That\u2019s the recipe for success.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing about raising the minimum wage to $15 that helps any of that, and those are problems we have right now.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: It is an arbitrary number, isn\u2019t it, to go, to jump \u2014 in many cases, we\u2019re talking about from $10 to $15 an hour.\n\nDAVID COOPER: Not entirely.\n\nWhen you look at what it actually takes for someone to have a modest, but decent standard of living in most cities in the United States, you\u2019re talking about a wage somewhere around $15 an hour. And, actually, if you look at where the federal minimum wage historically was, historically, back in the late 1960s, just in terms of dollar value, it was the equivalent of about $10 an hour in today\u2019s dollars.\n\nSo, if you are going to phase in a minimum wage increase to get us back to at least where we were in the \u201960s, and you\u2019re looking out four or five years, you have got to be setting a target somewhere in the range of $11, $12, $13 to account for the fact that there is going to be inflation over that time period that is going to eat away at that value.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Douglas Holtz \u2014 go ahead, yes.\n\nDOUGLAS HOLTZ-EAKIN: But don\u2019t look back. Look forward. Right?\n\nIt means nothing to say this in 1960, this in 1980. This is where we are. We have got dramatic problems in the labor market that are a source of real pain to Americans. We need to have better policies to get faster growth and get the productivity I mentioned.\n\nAnd while it sounds great to say you\u2019re going to make $30,000 a year, again, the benefits of this are not going to those in poverty. We need to get policies that actually target those who are having trouble having an adequate standard of living.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Well, the laws are changing, but the debate continues.\n\nAnd we thank both of you for joining us tonight to talk about all this.\n\nDOUGLAS HOLTZ-EAKIN: Thank you.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Douglas Holtz-Eakin, David Cooper, we thank you.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The fight for a $15 per hour minimum wage has won its biggest victories yet.
