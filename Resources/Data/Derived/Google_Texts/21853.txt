Story highlights Jeb Bush wrote an editorial backing gun rights that was publish Monday

In it, he's stresses cracking down on criminals and touts steps he took as governor

He also slammed Hillary Clinton for her comments about the NRA

(CNN) Jeb Bush staunchly defended Second Amendment rights in an op-ed published Monday, hitting Hillary Clinton for declaring the NRA as one of her enemies.

While the op-ed is pegged to the kick-off of deer hunting season and was scheduled prior to last week's shooting at Planned Parenthood, it nonetheless comes amid the latest round of the gun control debate sparked by the violence in Colorado.

"Liberals like Hillary Clinton always hold up gun control as a panacea to crime, even though the proposals they have put forward would have done nothing to stop any of the tragic shootings that have occurred recently in America," he wrote.
