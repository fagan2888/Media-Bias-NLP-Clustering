I could almost feel my fingers rebelling. After all, in his capacity as a \u201cliberal\u201d Fox News analyst, Bob Beckel has staked a claim for himself as one of the more odious personalities on television. In a past life, I wrote a story entitled \u201cBob Beckel Has A Long History of Saying Awful Things on TV,\u201d a roundup of some of his choice thoughts on diverse topics such as Muslims (he basically thinks they should all be interned), \u201cChinamen,\u201d and rape. I once ran a picture of Beckel under a headline that simply read, \u201cTHE WORST.\u201d So it takes quite a lot to elicit sympathy for the man from me.\n\nWell, thanks to the notoriously scorched-earth press team over at Fox News, the unthinkable has happened. On Thursday afternoon, the network informed Mediaite that Beckel\u2014who had been off the air for a while thanks to some well-publicized struggles with drug addiction \u2014 is no longer on the payroll and won\u2019t be returning as a co-host of panel show \u201cThe Five.\u201d After the site said that the parting was \u201camicable,\u201d Fox News went to Politico to emphasize that, no, it was not:\n\n\u201cWe tried to work with Bob for months, but we couldn\u2019t hold \u2018The Five\u2019 hostage to one man\u2019s personal issues,\u201d Bill Shine, executive vice president of programming, said in a statement. \u201cHe took tremendous advantage of our generosity, empathy and goodwill and we simply came to the end of the road with him.\u201d\n\nTo call that \u201charsh\u201d isn\u2019t even an understatement. It\u2019s an under-under-under-under-understatement. Fox News is famous for the pugnaciousness it employs when talking about its competitors, but to turn on your own employee like that when he\u2019s dealing with a drug problem is fairly jaw-dropping. No matter what private misery Bob Beckel may have put his colleagues through, Fox News had the option of letting him go quietly and leaving him to handle his clearly tough fight with addiction. Instead, the network chose to drive the knife through. That\u2019ll definitely help Beckel get better, won\u2019t it?\n\nReally, I don\u2019t know why I would have expected anything less from the Fox News PR team, which operates like a particularly vindictive campaign war room rather than a standard media operation. Any journalist who has had even the faintest brush with the communications staff there comes away from the encounter fairly astounded at the vitriolic, heavy-handed tactics they employ. I should know; when I was editing the Huffington Post\u2019s media section, I landed on the network\u2019s notorious blacklist. Fox News cut off all contact with me completely. Spokespeople would email editors of other sections if they had corrections. They would call my deputies and if I picked up the phone, they would panic and hang up. It was crazy! (Though I definitely preferred being frozen out to having to deal with the constant, hyper-aggressive messages.) And my experience is nothing when you compare it to that of Matthew Flamm, a reporter whose crime was writing about the good ratings CNN was enjoying in 2013. As NPR\u2019s David Folkenflik reported, Fox News actually planted a false story with Flamm and then released a statement to a rival outlet ridiculing him after he printed it.\n\nFox News will even turn on its own PR people, as it did when its former press chief Brian Lewis fell out with Roger Ailes. Bill Shine (remember him from a couple hundred words ago?) told reporters that Lewis was fired for \u201cissues relating to financial irregularities, as well as for multiple, material and significant breaches of his employment contract.\u201d However, some reports suggested that the real reason for his (very public) axing was the suspicion that he was a source for New York magazine\u2019s Gabriel Sherman\u2019s much-touted book about Roger Ailes.\n\nSo, poor Bob Beckel never stood a chance. He has now become an official enemy of Fox News. If he\u2019s reading this, I want him to know something: Life is better that way. And if it means anything, his former employer even got me to feel bad for him.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Fox fired Bob Beckel, who is struggling with addiction, and then twisted the knife for good measure.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Alternet", "description": "Fox fired Bob Beckel, who is struggling with addiction, and then twisted the knife for good measure.", "title": "Fox News Just Fired One of Its Hosts in the Most Vicious and Humiliating Way Imaginable", "url": "http://www.alternet.org/media/fox-news-just-fired-one-its-hosts-most-vicious-and-humiliating-way-imaginable", "image": "http://www.alternet.org/files/story_images/screen_shot_2015-06-27_at_11.24.48_am.png", "type": "article"}, "dc": {"title": "Fox News Just Fired One of Its Hosts in the Most Vicious and Humiliating Way Imaginable"}, "fb": {"page_id": 17108852506, "pages": 17108852506}, "google-site-verification": "-yUzdOYz6i2iShII0x_PYzsvnhQUG2f751funoPlCNM", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-27T15:13:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.1, maximum-scale=10.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8cd0\"", "article_summary": "Fox News Just Fired One of Its Hosts in the Most Vicious and Humiliating Way ImaginableThese are words I never thought I would say: I feel kind of sorry for Bob Beckel.\nAfter all, in his capacity as a \u201cliberal\u201d Fox News analyst, Bob Beckel has staked a claim for himself as one of the more odious personalities on television.\nSo, poor Bob Beckel never stood a chance.\nWell, thanks to the notoriously scorched-earth press team over at Fox News, the unthinkable has happened.\nIf he\u2019s reading this, I want him to know something: Life is better that way."}
