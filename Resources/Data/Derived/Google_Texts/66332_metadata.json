Because I can just send my workers off to the health insurance marketplace to get health insurance from the federal government.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut a new Texas-wide survey shows that\u2019s just not happening. It looked at job-based insurance in 2013, right before the law went into effect, and then compared it to this past March.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve found is employer-sponsored insurance is remaining pretty steady,\u201d said Ho, who co-authored the report along with Elena Marks, president and CEO of the Episcopal Health Foundation.\n\nBefore the law, 67 percent of workers in Texas got insurance through their jobs. The survey revealed a slight uptick to 68 percent.\n\nThe law penalizes most medium and large companies that don\u2019t insure workers, and penalizes many workers if they don\u2019t sign up for that insurance. (There are exceptions for low-income workers, particularly in states that did not expand Medicaid.)\n\nHo theorized that more workers are now signing up for coverage that they had previously declined, citing the high cost of premiums. But for many workers the premiums may now be cheaper than the tax penalty they\u2019d have to pay for not being covered.\n\n\u201cI think that most of it is that workers are doing a better uptake,\u201d Ho said. \u201cLots of people realized that there was going to be a penalty.\u201d\n\nHo also discussed anecdotal reports that some employers, such as her own Rice University, have encouraged sign-ups by offering new lower-cost health plan options that appeal to their lower-salaried workers.\n\nThe trend in Texas mirrors what is happening nationally \u2013 with job-based insurance holding steady after the law passed. Before the law, employers were increasingly dropping the benefit.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Affordable Care Act", "description": "Rice University healthcare economist Vivian Ho attributes a slight uptick in the number of Texans who get their health insurance through their jobs to the Affordable Care Act.", "programs": "none", "og": {"site_name": "Houston Public Media", "description": "Rice University healthcare economist Vivian Ho attributes a slight uptick in the number of Texans who get their health insurance through their jobs to the Affordable Care Act.", "title": "Texas Employers Stop Dropping Health Benefits Under Affordable Care Act | Houston Public Media", "url": "https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/2015/10/09/124266/texas-employers-stop-dropping-health-benefits-under-affordable-care-act/", "image": {"url": "https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/09161146/aca-texas-400px-310px-tn.png", "identifier": "https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/09161146/aca-texas-400px-310px-tn.png"}, "type": "article"}, "wordCount": 371, "twitter": {"description": "Rice University healthcare economist Vivian Ho attributes a slight uptick in the number of Texans who get their health insurance through their jobs to the Affordable Care Act.", "title": "Texas Employers Stop Dropping Health Benefits Under Affordable Care Act", "url": "https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/2015/10/09/124266/texas-employers-stop-dropping-health-benefits-under-affordable-care-act/", "image": "https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/09161146/aca-texas-400px-310px-tn.png", "creator": "@houstonpubmedia", "site": "@houstonpubmedia", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Carrie Feibel", "org_id": 220, "datePublished": "2015-10-09T16:12:55+00:00", "fb": {"admins": 37511993, "app_id": 1520489194943572, "pages": 27589213702}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "article": {"section": "News", "tag": "rice university", "published_time": "2015-10-09T16:12:55+00:00"}, "keywords": "Affordable Care Act, Health & Science, News, aca, health insurance, labor, obamacare, rice university", "google-site-verification": "QOrBnMZ1LXDA9tL3e5WmFUU-oI3JUbDRotOWST1P_Dg", "has_audio": 0, "bitly-verification": "7777946f1a0a"}, "article_summary": "Because I can just send my workers off to the health insurance marketplace to get health insurance from the federal government.\u2019\u201dBut a new Texas-wide survey shows that\u2019s just not happening.\nBefore the law, employers were increasingly dropping the benefit.\nRice University healthcare economist Vivian Ho attributes a slight uptick in the number of Texans who get their health insurance through their jobs to the Affordable Care Act.\nIt looked at job-based insurance in 2013, right before the law went into effect, and then compared it to this past March.\nThe trend in Texas mirrors what is happening nationally \u2013 with job-based insurance holding steady after the law passed."}
