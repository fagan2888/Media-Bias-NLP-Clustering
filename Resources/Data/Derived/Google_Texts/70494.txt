CANNES, France (AP) — Natalie Portman is at home on the Cannes red carpet, but her appearance Saturday was her first as director as well as star.

Portman wrote, directed and stars in the Hebrew-language festival entry "A Tale of Love and Darkness."

She wore an elegant dress from Dior Couture's spring-summer 2015 collection with an A-line skirt in black-patterned pale blue silk and a black strapless bodice. The look was topped by sleek, pulled-back hair and white diamond De Grisogono earrings.

Portman has received lukewarm reviews for the film, a handsomely mounted tale of a young boy coming of age in the newly formed Israeli state in the late 1940s. Portman plays the boy's sensitive, imaginative mother in the film, adapted from a novel by Amos Oz.
