But he soon realized there was a big need in less isolated spots. Now, a majority of the foundation\u2019s resources are devoted to staging pop-up clinics in the United States, where health care might be nearby but, for some, financially unreachable.\n\nThe documentary \u201cRemote Area Medical\u201d chronicles three days in the life of one of these temporary clinics. In 2012, filmmakers Jeff Reichert and Farihah Zaman headed to a NASCAR speedway in Bristol, Tenn., to see Brock and his army of volunteers at work. And what starts out mainly as a glimpse of harrowing logistics turns into a heartbreaking examination of poverty-stricken America.\n\nPeople begin lining up Tuesday for a first-come entry ticket to the makeshift clinic, which doesn\u2019t open until Friday. Some of those waiting have serious ailments \u2014 X-rays reveal a spot on a heavy smoker\u2019s lung. But many of the patients most critically need dental work \u2014 not just filling cavities, but pulling decayed teeth. One man seems especially pleased that he doesn\u2019t have do it again with a wrench.\n\nThat same amiable man lets the cameras follow as he leaves the clinic and visits a friend\u2019s house to snort crushed pain pills he bought on the street. He\u2019s not proud of this, he explains, but buying drugs is cheaper than a doctor\u2019s visit.\n\nHe\u2019s just one of many vibrant, memorable characters the filmmakers capture. And that\u2019s one of the movie\u2019s strengths. The ghost of policy may always be in the background, but the focus remains firmly on the stories of American citizens struggling to stay afloat in a depressed economy. And their inability to care for themselves and their families is clearly a crushing reality.\n\nThe camera work ranges from utilitarian to arresting, with opening shots that pan the final gasp of autumn colors along Bristol\u2019s rolling hills. But some of the scenes aren\u2019t for the squeamish. The filmmakers don\u2019t shy from showing the gruesome details of all those tooth extractions.\n\nIt\u2019s not all dire, though. The film is edited to balance the poignancy with brief bits of levity, not the least of which is the image of Brock, outfitted all in khaki like an aged scoutmaster, flitting around the racetrack on his bicycle.\n\nBut even with those funnier moments and the displays of in\u00adcred\u00adible generosity from the volunteer corps, \u201cRemote Area Medical\u201d is an in\u00adcred\u00adibly tragic movie. It\u2019s also an important one, reminding viewers that America is more than its coasts and cities. There are corners of the country we all too easily forget.\n\n\u2605 \u2605 \u2605\n\nUnrated. At West End Cinema. Contains troubling images and drug use. 83 minutes.\n\nDirector Jeff Reichert will participate in a Q&A following the 7 p.m. shows Friday and Saturday.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "movie review, remote area medical, stan brock, remote area medical documentary, gogmovies2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The documentary chronicles a traveling pop-up medical clinic that sets up shop in Bristol, Tenn.", "title": "\u2018Remote Area Medical\u2019 movie review", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/goingoutguide/movies/remote-area-medical-movie-review/2014/12/03/70e40212-74eb-11e4-a755-e32227229e7b_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/11/27/Weekend/Images/wk-remote1205-1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@stephmerry"}, "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "movie review, remote area medical, stan brock, remote area medical documentary, gogmovies2", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "eomportal-uuid": "70e40212-74eb-11e4-a755-e32227229e7b", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "description": "The documentary chronicles a traveling pop-up medical clinic that sets up shop in Bristol, Tenn."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd27e4\"", "article_summary": "But even with those funnier moments and the displays of in\u00adcred\u00adible generosity from the volunteer corps, \u201cRemote Area Medical\u201d is an in\u00adcred\u00adibly tragic movie.\nThe documentary \u201cRemote Area Medical\u201d chronicles three days in the life of one of these temporary clinics.\nDecades ago, philanthropist Stan Brock started Remote Area Medical as a way to bring medical care to the most far-flung places, such as rural villages in Africa and South America, where the closest hospital might be a multiday journey away.\nBut many of the patients most critically need dental work \u2014 not just filling cavities, but pulling decayed teeth.\nIn 2012, filmmakers Jeff Reichert and Farihah Zaman headed to a NASCAR speedway in Bristol, Tenn., to see Brock and his army of volunteers at work."}
