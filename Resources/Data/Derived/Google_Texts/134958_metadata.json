Medical, vision or dental services were provided by volunteer medical professionals: doctors, nurses, dentists, optometrists, social workers, chiropractors, massage therapists, Naturopathics, many general support volunteers, and even trained dogs to help anxious visitors. I was there as a volunteer registered nurse.\n\nParticipants waited anywhere from midnight to 6 a.m to get free care.

Many others have insurance, work at one or more jobs, have mental illness, but can\u2019t access health care due to high deductibles and high co-pays.
