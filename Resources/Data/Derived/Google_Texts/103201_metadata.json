If that happens, she will be lucky to avoid the fight. Most of the concerns about an unopposed Clinton candidacy are overstated, and there are big reasons she will benefit from running unopposed in the presidential primary.\n\nVigorous primary campaigns do tend to make fundamentally sound candidates stronger. They provide an opportunity for candidates to refine their messages, raise money, register voters, build organizations and gain additional valuable experience. Barack Obama, who had few weaknesses but little experience, was served exceptionally well by the 2008 Democratic primaries.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut primary campaigns tend to expose the flaws of fundamentally weak candidates. Take Mitt Romney, who was tarred as a flip-flopper in 2012 and forced to move to the right on immigration and other issues. Establishment Republicans blamed the primary debates and have since moved to reassert control over the process. But the debates weren\u2019t the problem; Mitt Romney was. He had changed his positions on a number of crucial issues, and when he was governor of Massachusetts, he had overseen the creation of a health care plan similar to the Affordable Care Act. All this was bound to be examined in a competitive primary campaign, regardless of how many debates were sanctioned by the Republican National Committee.\n\nThe primary had an obvious and negative effect on public views of Mr. Romney. His unfavorable ratings surged to around 50 percent and never recovered. His favorable ratings ultimately rose to meet his unfavorable ratings, mainly because Republicans ultimately rallied behind him, but I\u2019m nonetheless skeptical of the position of my colleague Brendan Nyhan, who doesn\u2019t think it made much difference. At the very least, I\u2019m sure the Romney campaign would have preferred to start the general election with an even favorability rating rather than one with a minus 10.\n\nFor a candidate as strong as Mrs. Clinton, there are a lot of reasons many liberal Democrats \u2014 and voters more generally \u2014 could have reservations about her candidacy. As ProPublica\u2019s Alec MacGillis put it, \u201cThere is a sort of collective amnesia\u201d about Mrs. Clinton among Democrats, and particularly among former Obama supporters, regarding their old \u201cestimation of Mrs. Clinton.\u201d The concerns include foreign policy, ties to Wall Street and the various reservations about her personal dealings, revived by news about foreign donations to the Clinton Foundation and her use of a personal email account and server while secretary of state.\n\nThe Primary Hurt Mitt Romney His favorable ratings ultimately recovered, but his unfavorable ratings remained near 50 percent for the whole campaign. Mitt Romney\u2019s favorable and unfavorable ratings in national surveys. % 40 20 0 Favorable Unfavorable 2011 2012 2013 Mitt Romney\u2019s favorable and unfavorable ratings in national surveys. % 40 20 0 Favorable Unfavorable 2011 2012 2013 Mitt Romney\u2019s favorable and unfavorable ratings in national surveys. % 40 20 0 Favorable Unfavorable 2011 2012 2013\n\nMr. MacGillis argues that it would be better for Democrats to reckon with their true feelings about Mrs. Clinton in the primary rather than in the general election. That may be true on matters of style \u2014 on the \u201chyper-cautious answers\u201d or \u201cdisingenuous\u201d efforts to align herself with the moods of the moment that Mr. MacGillis cites. But on the more substantive matters, a credible and vigorous primary challenger would be the single likeliest thing to increase Democratic dissatisfaction with her candidacy. It would involve a full year of a liberal Democrat and allies reminding liberal Democrats of all of the reasons they thought Mrs. Clinton was a problematic candidate in the first place.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMrs. Clinton has a good chance of fending off these charges with a unified Democratic Party. Republicans won\u2019t attack her for being overly hawkish on national security, and Democrats won\u2019t countenance a Republican like Jeb Bush or Scott Walker attacking Mrs. Clinton on her ties to Wall Street. Controversies about the Clintons \u2014 like over the Clinton Foundation or her email account \u2014 are far less likely to take hold if Democrats defend her.\n\nBut without a unified party, she could face recurring and resonant attacks on all of those issues. Though it probably wouldn\u2019t be as bad as what Mr. Romney faced, it could also be worse. After a year of being characterized as a Wall Street hack, or a warmonger with low-grade corruption issues, Mrs. Clinton could face a Ralph Nader-like third-party challenge, which generally becomes likelier after a party has held the White House for consecutive terms.\n\nAnd Mrs. Clinton is not the type of candidate who benefits most from a primary campaign. She is not an inexperienced candidate who needs to be vetted or to prove her ability to handle a presidential campaign. The 2008 Democratic primary was as intense and as long as most general election campaigns. Her experience as first lady and secretary of state gives her additional national and international political experience.\n\nHer total political experience entering the 2016 contest is probably more akin to that of an incumbent president than anything else. Did Presidents Obama or Bush or Clinton struggle in the general elections in 2012, 2004 and 1996 because they weren\u2019t tested in the primaries? It may have hurt them a little bit in the first debate. But incumbent presidents tend to fare pretty well in presidential elections, and I don\u2019t remember too much talk about the trouble they faced getting back into playing shape.\n\nPerhaps she\u2019s rustier than most \u2014 it has been seven years since she last ran \u2014 but it\u2019s not as if Mrs. Clinton will be on the sidelines for the next year. She\u2019ll probably engage and respond to her Republican opponents, she\u2019ll hold events in the early primary states, and she can debate the likes of Jim Webb and Lincoln Chafee if her campaign thinks it\u2019s useful practice for her. Back in 2008, she was generally thought to be a better debater than Mr. Obama, and she\u2019ll have plenty of opportunities over the next year and half to get back up to speed.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20150413094512, "twitter": {"description": "A tough primary can benefit candidates, letting them display their strengths, but this is a case in which it would hurt more than help.", "creator": "Nate_Cohn", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/14/upshot/hillary-clinton-doesnt-need-a-primary-fight.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003624811"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "title": "No, Hillary Clinton Would Not Benefit From a Primary Fight", "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/04/14/upshot/14UP-primary/14UP-primary-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/14/upshot/hillary-clinton-doesnt-need-a-primary-fight.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003624811", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/14/upshot/hillary-clinton-doesnt-need-a-primary-fight.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "upshot", "channels": "NytNow", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/upshot/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "April 13, 2015", "edt": "The New York Times on the Web", "keywords": "Presidential Election of 2016,Clinton  Hillary Rodham,Primaries and Caucuses,United States Politics and Government", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Nate Cohn", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/04/14/upshot/14UP-primary/14UP-primary-thumbLarge.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Clinton, Hillary Rodham", "slug": "14up-primary", "byl": "By NATE COHN", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "A tough primary can benefit candidates, letting them display their strengths, but this is a case in which it would hurt more than help.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/04/14/upshot/14UP-primary/14UP-primary-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "A tough primary can benefit candidates, letting them display their strengths, but this is a case in which it would hurt more than help.", "CG": "upshot", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "April 13, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/c/nate_cohn/index.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/upshot", "section": "The Upshot", "modified": "2015-04-13", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/upshot/index.jsonp", "tag": "United States Politics and Government", "published": "2015-04-13", "section-taxonomy-id": "D64FAE4C-4425-4E5A-B898-6C8CB59F9957"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20150413212738, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/14/upshot/hillary-clinton-doesnt-need-a-primary-fight.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/04/14/upshot/14UP-primary/14UP-primary-facebookJumbo.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A tough primary can benefit candidates, letting them display their strengths, but this is a case in which it would hurt more than help.", "title": "No, Hillary Clinton Would Not Benefit From a Primary Fight"}, "pdate": 20150413, "des": "United States Politics and Government", "articleid": 100000003624811, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "No, Hillary Clinton Would Not Benefit From a Primary Fight", "col": "Road to 2016", "PST": "News"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe060a\"", "article_summary": "The Primary Hurt Mitt Romney His favorable ratings ultimately recovered, but his unfavorable ratings remained near 50 percent for the whole campaign.\nAnd Mrs. Clinton is not the type of candidate who benefits most from a primary campaign.\nTake Mitt Romney, who was tarred as a flip-flopper in 2012 and forced to move to the right on immigration and other issues.\n% 40 20 0 Favorable Unfavorable 2011 2012 2013 Mitt Romney\u2019s favorable and unfavorable ratings in national surveys.\nPerhaps she\u2019s rustier than most \u2014 it has been seven years since she last ran \u2014 but it\u2019s not as if Mrs. Clinton will be on the sidelines for the next year."}
