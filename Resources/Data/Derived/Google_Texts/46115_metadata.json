Trump and the other \u201coutsiders\u201d are merely the beneficiaries of the anger and dissatisfaction of a large majority of the electorate fed up with the gridlock in Washington.\n\nThe primaries and caucuses are the only way citizens have a voice to express their point of view. The message the citizens are sending is clear: The senators and representatives of the people (not the donors) are not doing the job they were elected and are paid to do, namely, run the government for the benefit of the people.\n\nAs the party leadership wrings its hands trying to figure out how to stop Trump, it continues its pattern of gridlock, trying to \u201cwin the game\u201d of the Republicans against the Democrats. For Republicans, it has been how to \u201cprevent Obama from having a second term,\u201d as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said, how to repeal Obamacare, and the latest, how to not hold a hearing or a vote on the Supreme Court nominee. Obviously, the Republican Party leaders (and their donors) are so myopic they have not yet seen the voters\u2019 writing on the wall. They are still destroying their party from within.\n\nOtto von Bismarck once said, \u201cPolitics is the art of the possible.\u201d It is not getting the perfect deal. Government is no place for idealists of any persuasion, because the goal is to bring divergent views together to get \u201cthe best deal possible\u201d for the people given the divergent viewpoints of their representatives. Even the Founding Fathers had to compromise to give us the Constitution we have.\n\n\u2014 Jean M.
