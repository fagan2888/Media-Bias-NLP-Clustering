They began on a tree-lined shopping drag, turned along the tranquil northern edge of the Meadows, one of the city\u2019s larger parks, and wound up in a busy commercial district some half-hour later. The pastoral section of an otherwise urban jaunt, the researchers found, induced a significant increase in meditative thinking.\n\nThis may not strike you as a novel discovery. Thanks to Henry Thoreau\u2019s trip to Walden Pond, Teddy Roosevelt\u2019s sojourn in the Badlands, and America\u2019s other legends of retreat, the idea that nature has restorative powers is deeply embedded in our culture. Science is in support: A raft of studies credit bucolic settings with reducing aggression, alleviating depression, and improving mental function.\n\nThis is not quite the same old story, though. The results of the Edinburgh study were obtained through mobile electroencephalography (EEG) technology. Participants took their 25-minute walk with a web of electrodes glued to their scalps and a laptop computer in a backpack to record their neural impressions, step by step. When the paper says that the transition to North Meadow Lane was marked by \u201creductions in arousal, frustration and engagement, and an increase in meditation,\u201d it is not referring to participants\u2019 reactions on a lab-administered survey or test, but to fluctuations in brain activity recorded in situ.\n\nIt is, the researchers say, one of the first \u2014 if not the first \u2014 experiments to record live neural impressions of subjects moving through a city, and it has provocative implications for architecture and urban design. For centuries, philosophers and poets have struggled to define the character of place; to explain why some streets make people feel cozy and some lonely, some squares are friendly and some harsh; to understand what the French sociologist Guy Debord called \u201cthe evident division of a city into zones of distinct psychic atmospheres.\u201d Mobile neuroscience is about to transcribe our sense of spatial perception, breaking the mystery of urban life into neatly measured surges of cerebral activity.\n\nElectroencephalography tracks voltage flows within the brain. It has been widely used in cognitive science experiments and to diagnose epilepsy and other neural disorders. Though EEG lacks the spatial precision of magnetic resonance imagining (MRI), it has a few advantages over more sophisticated methods of brain analysis. It\u2019s relatively cheap, requires little heavy equipment, and is very forgiving of subject movement. All these make EEG a good technology for measuring brains on the go.\n\nStill, mobile EEGs are relatively new, and their scientific reliability was only established in September 2012, when a paper in the journal Psychophysiology, \u201cHow about taking a low-cost, small and wireless EEG for walk?\u201d confirmed that solid data could be obtained from such trials.\n\nIn the Edinburgh study, \u201cThe Urban Brain: Analyzing Outdoor Physical Activity With Mobile EEG,\u201d which was published in March, the team used a wireless EEG headset made by the Australian electronics company Emotiv. It is essentially a commercial device, rather than a piece of medical equipment, which entails some caveats that might not sit well with neuroscientists. The researchers had to put faith in Emotiv\u2019s algorithm that \u201ctranslates\u201d raw electric brain data from 14 sensors into user-friendly metrics of frustration, engagement, excitement and meditation.\n\nThe results from downtown Edinburgh were clear enough. North Meadow Walk induced a meditative state. Excitement remained high in both the first and second legs of the journey, where social interaction was frequent. Moving from a busy urban environment to a park produced a greater mental change than leaving the park, indicating lingering mental benefits of natural surroundings.\n\nBut then the landscape variations were not particularly subtle. Evaluating the emotional impact of more nuanced urban variables, like traffic or light quality, would be more difficult. Can we isolate a subject\u2019s reaction to a bench, a factory building or a tram passing by?\n\n\u201cSome scientists I\u2019ve spoken to since have come back and said, \u2018You\u2019re lucky to get a good result, because we couldn\u2019t,'\u201d explains Richard Coyne, a professor of architecture at the University of Edinburgh and one of the paper\u2019s four authors. \u201cThe frequencies of nerve impulses can be generated by all sorts of things. Blinking. Squinting. Moving your head. They can be influenced by muscular movements.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Amazing new studies and brain results show nature reduces aggression, fights depression, improves mental function", "title": "Parks make us smarter \u2014 science proves it!", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Amazing new studies and brain results show nature reduces aggression, fights depression, improves mental function", "title": "Parks make us smarter \u2014 science proves it!", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/09/21/parks_make_us_smarter_science_proves_it/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/09/central_park_dream_city.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Amazing new studies and brain results show nature reduces aggression, fights depression, improves mental function", "title": "Parks make us smarter \u2014 science proves it!", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/09/central_park_dream_city.jpg", "creator": "@HenryGrabar", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Henry Grabar", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Architecture, Dream City, Editor's Picks, EEG, Neuroscience, sustainability", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1a59\"", "article_summary": "Science is in support: A raft of studies credit bucolic settings with reducing aggression, alleviating depression, and improving mental function.\nThe results of the Edinburgh study were obtained through mobile electroencephalography (EEG) technology.\nIt has been widely used in cognitive science experiments and to diagnose epilepsy and other neural disorders.\nThe pastoral section of an otherwise urban jaunt, the researchers found, induced a significant increase in meditative thinking.\nIn the Edinburgh study, \u201cThe Urban Brain: Analyzing Outdoor Physical Activity With Mobile EEG,\u201d which was published in March, the team used a wireless EEG headset made by the Australian electronics company Emotiv."}
