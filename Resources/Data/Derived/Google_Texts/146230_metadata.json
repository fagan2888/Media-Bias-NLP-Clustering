Unfortunately, that often requires cuts.\u201d\n\nThis summer, HHSC\u2019s East Hawaii facilities \u2014 including Hilo Medical Center, Ka\u2018u Hospital and Hale Ho\u2018ola Hamakua \u2014 began making cuts to services and cutting 87 employee positions to make up a $7 million shortfall for fiscal year 2016.\n\nThe projected shortfall for next year will necessitate additional cuts that could seriously undermine the quality of care provided to Big Isle residents, said East Hawaii Regional Board Chairman Kurt Corbin.\n\n\u201cThe layoffs \u2026 and consolidation of services, we believe, are not in the best interest of our community, our employees and their families, and at some point begin to erode the quality of life in our community, which is defined by quality of education, quality of health care and also the vibrancy of our economy,\u201d he told members of the state House of Representatives\u2019 Committee on Finance, which was in Hilo Monday as part of a round of site visits on the Neighbor Islands.\n\nThis morning, HHSC\u2019s East Hawaii Regional Board is scheduled to discuss and vote in executive session regarding a plan to actively pursue public-private partnerships with other health care networks to help address increasing costs.\n\n\u201cEarlier this year, you passed legislation that would enable the current negotiations between Maui (Memorial Medical Center) and Kaiser (Permanente) that are going on right now. And I will tell you that it is our intent through HHSC to introduce legislation that would enable the other four regions to pursue such an option as well,\u201d Corbin told the legislators.\n\nIn June, HHSC\u2019s East Hawaii administrators began informal talks with representatives from Adventist Health, which operates Castle Medical Center on Oahu.\n\n\u201cThey were interested to know if we had any hospitality to the opportunity of talking about a range of relationships, all the way from integrating clinical services to sharing services, all the way up to and including a partnership,\u201d Corbin said. \u201cWe are in active conversations with them, and we have signed a non-disclosure and confidentiality agreement with them. We are in the very early stages of exchanging information in terms of finance and operations.\u201d\n\nRepresentatives from Adventist visited Hilo toward the end of September, and are scheduled to visit again in about three weeks, he added.\n\nThe goal of working with an entity such as Adventist, Corbin said, would be to make the hospital system\u2019s operations self reliant.\n\n\u201cIt is entirely possible, with the right partner, that there would be no reliance in the long term for operating subsidies,\u201d he said.\n\nEmail Colin M.
