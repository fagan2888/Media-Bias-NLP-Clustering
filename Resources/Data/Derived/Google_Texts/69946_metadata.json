This fine, a key component of the Affordable Care Act, was designed to push people to obtain healthcare coverage. But in practice, it\u2019s not exactly spurring people to sign up, raising questions about what other factors are prompting people to forgo insurance.\n\nThe fine is $95 per person or 1 percent of a person's annual income, whichever is higher. The tax is slated to go up next year to $325 per person or 2 percent of annual income.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the fine has been the nudge factor that it was designed to be,\u201d said Will Gonzalez, executive director of Ceiba, a coalition of Latino community organizations in Philadelphia that offers free tax preparation as part of its services. \u201cI still think that there\u2019s a need to help people understand the [enrollment] process more,\u201d he added.\n\nNearly 90 percent of Americans had health insurance this year, an all-time high, suggesting the Affordable Care Act has made great strides in making coverage more accessible and affordable. Since the law was implemented, an estimated 32.2 million people have signed up for plans through the healthcare exchanges it created. Now, insuring the remaining 11.9 percent of adults who don\u2019t have health coverage is the primary challenge.\n\nFor those who wanted to buy healthcare coverage through Obamacare, the period to do so initially ended Feb. 15. But the federal government, as well as several states that run their own exchanges, ultimately extended the enrollment deadline to the strategic date of April 30, two weeks after taxes are due. Governments also made it easy for people to qualify for the special enrollment period in case paying the healthcare penalty this year inspired them to sign up for insurance and avoid paying even more next year.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\n\u201cIf you owe a fee on your taxes for not having health coverage in 2014 and don\u2019t yet have health coverage for 2015, you may still be able to get coverage for 2015,\u201d a post on HealthCare.gov said. \u201cThe Health Insurance Marketplace is providing individuals and families who are subject to the fee when they file their 2014 taxes with one last chance to get covered for 2015.\u201d\n\nBut for those who have yet to sign up for coverage, being forced to pay a tax penalty doesn't seem to be a tipping point. A survey published in February by McKinsey, for instance, found that just 12 percent of adults would choose to buy health insurance upon learning they had to pay a penalty for going without it.\n\n\u201cI have not seen a massive uptick,\u201d Neil Deegan, the Pennsylvania director for the nonprofit Get Covered America, which works to help people gain health insurance, said of people signing up for insurance during the special enrollment period. \u201cIt\u2019s a slower rate\u201d than ordinary enrollment periods, he said.\n\nA Daunting Process\n\nOne reason people don\u2019t sign up for health insurance is because they give up on the complicated process. \u201cThe difficulty of the system was very frustrating to people,\u201d even for clients who did have health coverage, Sherry Diamond, president of Tax Stop Inc., a tax preparation company in New Jersey, said. \u201cThe whole signup process needs to be easier to manipulate.\u201d\n\nGonzalez, whose organization works primarily with low-income Latino residents in north Philadelphia, said that signing up for insurance required time as well as an understanding of the process. \u201cA lot of low-income people have very busy lives,\u201d he said. If they don\u2019t have the time to devote to working through a system that has had its share of bugs and quirks, frustration might deter them from signing up.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of people who started an application [for health coverage] and found it difficult and needed help,\u201d Steve Wood, a coordinator with the community-based organization ACR Health in upstate New York, said. At other times, people don't sign up because they don\u2019t know what coverage options were available to them. They might not realize they qualify for subsidies that significantly cut down on monthly premiums, for instance.\n\nWood said enrollment for health insurance during the extended period had been fairly steady, but some people nevertheless opted not to sign up. \u201cSometimes people are overextended,\u201d he explained. If they have student loans, mortgages and other bills to pay, \u201cadding another on top is not always feasible for them.\u201d\n\nWhen the complexity of the signup process or a lack of knowledge about it deters people from signing up, it\u2019s a sign that more work needs to be done, Maura Collinsgru, a health policy advocate at New Jersey Citizen Action, said. \u201cI have met people who have chosen not to enroll either because they didn\u2019t understand that they could get assistance, or they didn\u2019t know how to go about picking a plan,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to continue to do more intensive outreach.\u201d\n\nWeighing Health Against Cost\n\nFor the young and healthy, buying health insurance may also seem irrelevant, especially if the annual tax penalty appears comparatively cheaper than monthly premiums.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen people say, \u2018I\u2019m not going to get health insurance. It\u2019s cheaper to pay the fine,\u2019\u201d Gonzalez said. Often, he said, the decision to buy \u2013 or forgo \u2013 health insurance depends on a person\u2019s health at the moment. \u201cThe younger folks say, \u2018You know, what do I need insurance for?\u2019\u201d He said those who have health issues are more likely to sign up for insurance.\n\nBecause people don\u2019t expect to be hit with a health catastrophe or accident, having to pay a penalty doesn\u2019t seem to outweigh the cost of insurance. \u201cFor some people, their income may be high, and they perceive themselves as healthy,\u201d Woods said.\n\nFew of those who had to pay the penalty were surprised by it, said Diamond, the tax preparer. Clients will say, \u201cYeah, I know, I\u2019ve got to do this,\u201d she said, and she\u2019ll remind them that the federal signup period has been extended through April. \u201cThey sound like chastised children,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://s2.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "obamacare, obamacare enrollment, obamacare extension, affordable care act extension, obamacare tax penalty, how much is the tax penalty for not having insurance, unamerican to pay tax penalty, health insurance penalty, how to sign up for health insurance,", "og": {"site_name": "International Business Times", "description": "Confusion about how to enroll in health care coverage is one reason people don't sign up.", "title": "Tax Day Obamacare Penalty: Fine For Being Uninsured Doesn't Spur People To Sign Up For Health Care", "url": "http://www.ibtimes.com/tax-day-obamacare-penalty-fine-being-uninsured-doesnt-spur-people-sign-health-care-1881573", "image": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2015/04/14/image-462802400.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Confusion about how to enroll in health care coverage is one reason people don't sign up.", "title": "Tax Day Obamacare Penalty: Fine For Being Uninsured Doesn't Spur People To Sign Up For Health Care", "url": "http://www.ibtimes.com/tax-day-obamacare-penalty-fine-being-uninsured-doesnt-spur-people-sign-health-care-1881573", "image": {"src": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2015/04/14/image-462802400.jpg", "identifier": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2015/04/14/image-462802400.jpg"}, "site": "@IBTimes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "fb": {"app_id": 263851690471857, "pages": 128026713884051}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/IBTimes", "section": "World", "published_time": "2015-04-14T13:38:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-15T01:49:38-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Confusion about how to enroll in health care coverage is one reason people don't sign up."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0e38\"", "article_summary": "Often, he said, the decision to buy \u2013 or forgo \u2013 health insurance depends on a person\u2019s health at the moment.\nA Daunting ProcessOne reason people don\u2019t sign up for health insurance is because they give up on the complicated process.\n\u201cI still think that there\u2019s a need to help people understand the [enrollment] process more,\u201d he added.\nNow, insuring the remaining 11.9 percent of adults who don\u2019t have health coverage is the primary challenge.\nAt other times, people don't sign up because they don\u2019t know what coverage options were available to them."}
