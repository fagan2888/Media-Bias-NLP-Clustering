The information is being sent in the referrer header, which lets requested resources linked to from within HeathCare.gov know which page the request is coming from. It\u2019s also sometimes \u201cembedded in the request string itself,\u201d the EFF said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe EFF found that the information is being sent in both the referrer header and request string to analytics sites [company]Chartbeat[/company] and [company]Optimizely[/company], [company]Google[/company]\u2019s DoubleClick ad service, and Google itself. Personal-data-rich referrer headers are also finding their way to services such as [company]Twitter[/company], [company]Yahoo[/company], [company]YouTube[/company], [company]Akamai[/company] and \u2013 according to AP \u2013 [company]Facebook[/company]. HealthCare.gov does this even if the user has turned on Do Not Track.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHealthCare.gov spokesman Aaron Albright told AP that outside vendors \u201care prohibited from using information from these tools on HealthCare.gov for their companies\u2019 purposes,\u201d and they\u2019re only there for site performance measurement purposes. There is indeed no evidence of the data being misused.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, experts questioned why the likes of Facebook and Google had to get this information (Google itself denied allowing its systems to target ads based on medical history information.) As the EFF\u2019s Cooper Quintin pointed out, there are enormous opportunities for a service like DoubleClick to match up the data with other tracking information about the target. He also noted that the use of third-party resources creates more of an \u201cattack surface\u201d that hackers could use to gain access to the site.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.title": "HealthCare.gov gives trackers info on pregnancy, income and more", "application-name": "Gigaom", "dcterms.modified": "2015-01-21", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "dcterms.creator": "David Meyer", "dcterms.date": "2015-01-21", "keywords": "akamai, chartbeat, data protection, facebook, google, healthcare.gov, obamacare, optimizely, privacy, twitter, us, yahoo, youtube", "news_keywords": "akamai, data protection, facebook, google, healthcare.gov, privacy, twitter, us, yahoo, youtube", "author": "David Meyer", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "theme-color": "#ecebe6", "dcterms.publisher": "Gigaom", "description": "The U.S. government\u2019s healthcare insurance sign-up site HealthCare.gov is quietly handing over deeply personal information to advertising and social", "robots": "NOODP", "MobileOptimized": 320, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://gigaom.com/wp-content/themes/go-ossein/library/images/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "msvalidate.01": "6AFF4FA8C591A576B80A612AF591A343", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "dcterms.created": "2015-01-21", "og": {"image": "https://gigaom.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/1/2011/04/privacy-card-3x2.jpg"}, "dcterms.subject": "akamai; chartbeat; data protection; facebook; google; healthcare.gov; obamacare; optimizely; privacy; twitter; us; yahoo; youtube", "google-site-verification": "qCPIC6UK_23CR6SxLn2bCjE-Ow0OSYoDExoi699IE98", "y_key": "a09dd3172406080e"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb19a\"", "article_summary": "The U.S. government\u2019s healthcare insurance sign-up site HealthCare.gov is quietly handing over deeply personal information to advertising and social networks, according to a Tuesday Associated Press report.\nThe Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) followed up by checking out what\u2019s being passed on, and discovered it includes things like pregnancy status, income level, zipcode, smoking status, parental status and age.\nIt\u2019s also sometimes \u201cembedded in the request string itself,\u201d the EFF said.\nAdvertisementHowever, experts questioned why the likes of Facebook and Google had to get this information (Google itself denied allowing its systems to target ads based on medical history information.)\nPersonal-data-rich referrer headers are also finding their way to services such as [company]Twitter[/company], [company]Yahoo[/company], [company]YouTube[/company], [company]Akamai[/company] and \u2013 according to AP \u2013 [company]Facebook[/company]."}
