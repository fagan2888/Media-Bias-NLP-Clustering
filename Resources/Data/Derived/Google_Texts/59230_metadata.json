The Department of Health and Human Services announced that you may have one more week to get insured.\n\nIf you tried to buy health coverage on the federal marketplace but couldn\u2019t because of long wait times or website glitches, you may qualify for this special enrollment period. If you bought health insurance through the federal marketplace last year, however, you will not be allowed to make any changes to your coverage during this one-week extension.\n\nTry again by going back to HealthCare.gov from now through February 22. You\u2019ll need to attest that you couldn\u2019t enroll by the deadline because of a website or call center problem.\n\n\n\nAfter the deadline, that\u2019s it\u2014you won\u2019t be able to buy individual health insurance for 2015 unless you have you have a \u201cqualifying life event,\u201d like marrying, divorcing, having a baby, moving, or losing your health coverage.\n\nIf you live in one of the 13 states with their own exchanges or the District of Columbia, the rules are a little different. Most states have announced extensions of some sort. In some states, you get more time only if you tried to sign up before February 15; in others, everyone has more time. Check acasignups.net for a good round-up of state policies.\n\nWashington state currently offers the longest deadline extension: Residents have until April 17 to enroll. \u201cThis is the first year that residents may incur a tax penalty for not having health insurance under the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Richard Onizuka, chief executive officer of Washington\u2019s exchange, told the Wall Street Journal. \u201cThis special enrollment window will allow these individuals\u2014as well as those who experienced difficulty completing their applications\u2014additional time to get enrolled for 2015 coverage.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s right: If you were uninsured in 2014, you could owe a penalty on your taxes this year. This year, the penalty is either $95 per person in your family (capped at $285), or 1% of your income (capped at the price of the national average premium for a bronze plan), whichever is higher. Go uninsured in 2015 too, and you could owe even more next year.\n\nFor more on buying a policy for 2015, check out this full guide to Obamacare open enrollment.", "article_metadata": {"description": "For now, you only get extra time on the federal Marketplace if you already tried to buy health insurance\u2014but some states are offering more generous deadline extensions.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "MONEY.com", "description": "You can get more time if you tried to buy health insurance on the federal marketplace\u2014but some states are offering more generous grace periods.", "title": "The Obamacare Open Enrollment Deadline Has Been Extended", "url": "http://time.com/money/3711774/obamacare-open-enrollment-deadline-extension/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/150217_ff_obamacareextension.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/150217_ff_obamacareextension.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "description": "You can get more time if you tried to buy health insurance on the federal marketplace\u2014but some states are offering more generous grace periods.", "site": "MONEY", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "The Obamacare Open Enrollment Deadline Has Been Extended"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MoneyMagazine"}, "keywords": ", aca, exchanges, health care, health insurance, healthcare.gov, insurance exchanges, marketplace, obamacare, obamacare deadline, obamacare enrollment, obamacare penalty, open enrollment", "google-site-verification": "nFxFQf8F4Xgg0b9Ap9rOUJzg7MY74LicbBIzsLo8yIg", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "aca, exchanges, health care, health insurance, healthcare.gov, insurance exchanges, marketplace, obamacare, obamacare deadline, obamacare enrollment, obamacare penalty, open enrollment"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd6ac6\"", "article_summary": "Did you miss the February 15 deadline to buy health insurance for 2015?\nFor more on buying a policy for 2015, check out this full guide to Obamacare open enrollment.\nIf you bought health insurance through the federal marketplace last year, however, you will not be allowed to make any changes to your coverage during this one-week extension.\nIf you tried to buy health coverage on the federal marketplace but couldn\u2019t because of long wait times or website glitches, you may qualify for this special enrollment period.\nYou\u2019ll need to attest that you couldn\u2019t enroll by the deadline because of a website or call center problem."}
