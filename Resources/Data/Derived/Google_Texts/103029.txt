The owner of the landmark Bosler House who failed to appear at a Dec. 5 hearing to determine whether he violated Denver’s neglected and derelict building ordinance will be fined $999 a day, retroactive to May 9.

A hearing officer ruled last week that Keith Painter was in violation and the city could issue fines up to $999 a day, something the city will follow through on, said Andrea Burns, spokeswoman for the city’s planning department.

This means Painter would owe about $218,000 through Dec. 13, with an additional $999 added daily.

Painter owns the Bosler House, 3209 W. Fairview Place, a Denver landmark since 1984 — four years before he purchased it.

According to the city Landmark Preservation Commission, Painter pulled a reroofing permit in January 2009 but then began to modify the second-floor roofline of the brick home to add more habitable space without permits or preservation board review.

A stop-work order was issued.

Painter was notified by regular mail and by certified mail that he was expected to appear at the Dec. 5 hearing to argue why civil penalties and other enforcement action should not be taken against him, Burns said.

If the penalties continue to mount and exceed 110 percent of the assessed value of the home — about $495,000, according to city tax records — the house could be seized by the city.

“It is the city’s hope that Mr. Painter sells the property,” Burns said.

Painter applied for a demolition permit in 2010 and said he would prefer to tear down the house and replace it with condominiums overlooking Highland Park.

Painter said he never received notification of the Dec. 5 hearing. He said he has hired an attorney and hopes to vacate the fines.

“I own that property outright. And if the city pulls this off, they’re going to literally steal $500,000 from me,” Painter said. “Here I end up with nothing if they get their way.”
