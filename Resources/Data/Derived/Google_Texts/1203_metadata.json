She\u2019s a celebrity responsible for pushing \u201cconscious uncoupling\u201d into the vernacular and turning \u201cgoop\u201d into something less slimy. Together, President Barack Obama and actress Gwyneth Paltrow will be raising funds for the Democratic National Committee next week, marking the third time this year that the president is hitting up Hollywood and the entertainment elite\u2019s coffers.\n\nGwyneth Paltrow is hosting a fundraiser for the DNC at her Los Angeles home. Courtesy of the Sunlight Foundation's Political Party Time blog\n\nObama generally has never paid a political price for his fundraising and cozy relationships with A-list actors. \u201cI would say that Barack Obama, until recently, was an unusual case of someone who could get away with being seen with Hollywood celebrities,\u201d says Timothy Stanley, author of \u201cCitizen Hollywood: How the Collaboration between LA and DC Revolutionized American Politics.\u201d But Stanley thinks that\u2019s slowly becoming not the case. \u201cI think it\u2019s changing not because people hate Hollywood quite so much as they used to, but because they dislike the president more than they used to.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s true that Obama\u2019s disapproval ratings are high . And Stanley, also a columnist for The Telegraph, tells Whispers the change in perception regarding Obama and Hollywood occurred once the president began using celebrities, like comedian Zach Galifianakis, to promote Obamacare. \u201cSome of them were really quite low-rent as well \u2013 they were really quite crap celebrities,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I think that was the moment in which people started to snigger.\u201d\n\nThe Sunlight Foundation\u2019s Palmer Gibbs, who minds the watchdog\u2019s Political Party Time blog, says there\u2019s a political divide when it comes to the perception of gripping and grinning with movie stars. \u201cDemocrats love it,\u201d she says. \u201cIt really shows that they are really in with the cool kids.\u201d\n\nRepublicans? Not so much.\n\n\u201cEither political side will glom on to any of the details that are going to help them with their narrative and with their plot points,\u201d Gibbs explains. One example she cites is Obama\u2019s trip out West to raise funds at the home of \u201cScandal\u201d creator Shonda Rhimes in July. \u201cThere were plenty of people who were saying, \u2018He doesn\u2019t have time to do X, Y, Z in terms of being the president and leading ... he can only party with his friends,\u2019\u201d Gibbs recalls.\n\n\n\nHowever, Allan Lichtman, a distinguished professor of history at American University, contends the American public isn\u2019t paying attention at all. \u201cYou have to hit the public over the head with a two-by-four to get them to really pay attention to something in politics,\u201d he tells Whispers, adding that most Americans only tune in to political stories when something affects them personally. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t care less about Richard Nixon shaking hands with Elvis Presley, Marilyn Monroe singing \u2018Happy Birthday\u2019 to JFK or, you know, Reagan meeting with Michael Jackson.\u201d\n\nAmerican presidents were actually socializing with Hollywood way before JFK, starting with Republicans Calvin Coolidge and Herbert Hoover, Stanley explains. The film industry flipped to mostly Democratic during the administration of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, and FDR was politically hit for his relationship with studio heads\u200b in attacks that were veiled anti-semitism, Lichtman says, since many of those running Hollywood were Jewish.\n\nBill Clinton also hung out with Hollywood and paid a bit of a political price for it. \u201cBill Clinton got hurt by it because it made him look like he was fawning over them \u2026 that he was in love with liberal elites and he was hanging around beautiful people who were out of touch,\u201d Stanley says.\n\nObama\u2019s relationship with Tinseltown started much more slowly, says Stanley, who researched the evolution for his book. At first, Hollywood was part of Hillaryland, with stars throwing their support behind Obama's primary opponent, Hillary Clinton. \u200bObama\u2019s West Coast supporters, meanwhile, were fellow Harvard Law School alumni and personal friends. And once he started tapping into the Hollywood donor base, Stanley says, the president also made a faux pas.\n\n\u201cThis was a complaint I constantly heard from people: 'He never said \"thank you\" for money,'\" Stanley says. \u201cHollywood is California and it\u2019s obsessed with etiquette, and you\u2019ve got to say 'thank you.'\"\n\nThe president re-engaged with the film industry \u200bin the run-up to the 2012 campaign. He won Hollywood over, in part, by coming out for gay marriage.\n\nThese relationships didn't necessarily irritate the public because Obama had such a lukewarm attitude about Hollywood to begin with, Stanley suggests. \"So for two or three years Obama had this offhand relationship with them, and I think in the public\u2019s mind there was this separation, an unusual separation between the Democrats and Hollywood, that took place in those three years,\" he says.\n\nAdditionally, Stanley argues, the Obama campaign geared some of its celebrity advertising just right. For instance, the ads in which \u201cSex and the City\u201d star Sarah Jessica Parker and Vogue editor Anna Wintour invite supporters to join them in New York City for dinner: \u201cThe ad worked really well and raised a lot of money, and Obama\u2019s people said, 'That wasn\u2019t aimed at conservatives, that was aimed at single urban women and it worked out well for us,'\u201d Stanley says. \u201cSo it was smart.\u201d (Meanwhile, conservative pundit Glenn Beck blew a gasket.) That dinner, according to Whispers' calculations, raised about $2 million.\n\nGibbs says partisan criticism like Beck's\u200b is what tends to drive the narrative that the public isn't fond of cozy relationships between Hollywood and Washington. \u201cA lot of it is media bloviating on the subject because there isn\u2019t anything that is concrete, there aren\u2019t any poll numbers,\u201d she says.\n\nAs far as Whispers found, the last poll that connected Obama with Hollywood was taken before he was elected president. Rasmussen Reports asked 1,000 likely voters on Oct. 26, 2008, \u200bwho had more support from Hollywood. Not surprisingly, 78 percent said Obama compared to 5 percent who named the GOP presidential nominee, Sen. John McCain of Arizona. Forty percent of respondents also said Hollywood endorsements made them less likely to vote for a particular candidate. Fundraising wasn\u2019t even mentioned.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Washington Whispers [News]", "title": "Will President Obama Pay for Palling Around With Gwyneth Paltrow?", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Presidents don't always suffer in the eyes of the public for getting cozy with the Hollywood elite.", "title": "Will Obama Pay for Palling Around With Paltrow?", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/washington-whispers/2014/10/03/will-president-obama-pay-for-palling-around-with-gwyneth-paltrow", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/71/da/371d9f9248b5bf2f1b50ac9d43ac/141003-obamapaltrow-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Will President Obama Pay for Palling Around With Gwyneth Paltrow?", "description": "Presidents don't always suffer in the eyes of the public for getting cozy with the Hollywood elite.", "card": "summary", "site": "@USNews"}, "site": "news", "date_published": "Oct. 3, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Nikki Schwab,Pulse,picks,Obama, Barack,Hollywood,Parker, Sarah Jessica,Wintour, Anna,American University,fundraising,Washington Whispers [News]", "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Presidents don't always suffer in the eyes of the public for getting cozy with the Hollywood elite."}, "article_summary": "As far as Whispers found, the last poll that connected Obama with Hollywood was taken before he was elected president.\nTogether, President Barack Obama and actress Gwyneth Paltrow will be raising funds for the Democratic National Committee next week, marking the third time this year that the president is hitting up Hollywood and the entertainment elite\u2019s coffers.\nThese relationships didn't necessarily irritate the public because Obama had such a lukewarm attitude about Hollywood to begin with, Stanley suggests.\nAnd once he started tapping into the Hollywood donor base, Stanley says, the president also made a faux pas.\nNot surprisingly, 78 percent said Obama compared to 5 percent who named the GOP presidential nominee, Sen.
