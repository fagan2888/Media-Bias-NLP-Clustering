The campaign is causing public revulsion and condemnation.\n\nPopularly mocked as \u201cResisting-Japan Bizarre Dramas,\u201d these movie and TV productions often portray the communist-led anti-Japanese forces during the war in the most hagiographic and self-glorifying light. Chinese forces are shown carrying out all sorts of miracles to destroy Japanese troops, with soldiers throwing rocks to down Japanese military aircraft and a lone Chinese woman using hunting bows to kill dozens of fully armed Japanese soldiers.\n\nIn one episode of the TV series called \u201cOur Unit Designation Shall Never Fade,\u201d a Chinese battalion commander brings down a high-flying Japanese military airplane by hurling a hand grenade into the air. \u201cKill Every Japanese Devil\u201d has a scene that shows a Chinese man using a sewing needle to dispatch Japanese invading soldiers. In the drama \u201cFabulous Resisting-Japan Hero,\u201d the protagonist is immune to Japanese bullets and swords and is able to cut a Japanese soldier, with his bare hands, into two parts, from head to toe, like a cleaver slicing the length of a stick of bamboo.\n\nThe scripts are also bizarre and incredible.\n\nIndelibly imprinted into the Chinese popular lexicon are many infamous lines from these \u201cResisting-Japan Bizarre Dramas.\u201d One of them is this gem: \u201cMy grandfather was brutally killed by the Japanese devils when he was only 9 years old. I hate the Japanese.\u201d Another is a sentence in one drama that has been made into a mocking ringtone: \u201cI knocked out a Japanese devil\u2019s machine-gunner with a single bullet from 800 li away!\u201d A Chinese li is roughly a third of a mile, so the good comrade could kill a Japanese solider from 248 miles away.\n\nThe standard Chinese term to describe World War II is the \u201cEight-Year War of Resistance against Japan,\u201d counting the 1937 Marco Polo bridge incident as the beginning of the conflict. But the term was not used until after the war was over in 1945. Yet many Chinese TV and movie dramas routinely use this phrase in their scripts as if the communists already knew in 1937 or 1940 exactly how long the war would last.\n\nTo many Chinese viewers, the most repulsive aspect of these crudely anti-Japanese productions is the blatant display of salacious, often pornographic, scenes, broadcast during the prime evening viewing slots.\n\nIn a highly watched drama called \u201cThe Man From the Frontier City,\u201d a man gives a beautiful widow an aphrodisiac drink, followed by a full five-minute depiction of the woman\u2019s masturbation and the subsequent sex act between the two. The nation\u2019s jaws dropped from the broadcast.\n\nThis month, the talk of the nation in China is an episode of a popular anti-Japanese TV drama, broadcast by a station in Sichuan, China\u2019s most populous province. Titled \u201cLet Us Fight the Japanese Devils Together,\u201d the series, featuring the wife of 110-meter hurdler Liu Xiang, China\u2019s most celebrated athlete, is often criticized for its racy and steamy soft-porn contents masquerading as an officially sanctioned serious drama.\n\nIn this particular episode, the male protagonist, a bandit leader turned anti-Japanese hero, is detained by the Japanese occupation authorities. His wife, played by actress Ge Tian, Mr. Liu\u2019s wife, visits him in the cell. She miraculously manages to hide an elongated stick-type grenade in her vagina and passes the guards. While being watched by the Japanese military interrogator and his Chinese collaborator, the two then perform a last act of erotic intimacy while the husband insults the Japanese emperor. When the Japanese interrogator is about to shoot the man for the royal insult, the husband pulls the grenade from his wife\u2019s body, and the woman gleefully pulls the ignition pin, thus sacrificing their lives for the party and the motherland.\n\nTheir last words: \u201cLet\u2019s have an ecstatic moment one more time.\u201d Enemy defeated, game over.\n\nThe backlash to these socialist, surrealist dramas has been momentous in China, so much so that the party leadership moved to curb the enthusiasm of the country\u2019s artistic propaganda community. The official Xinhua News Agency on Thursday published a rare hard-hitting article calling the shows \u201cvulgar and deviant.\u201d After a national outcry, the Communist Party\u2019s propaganda department promptly banned the broadcast of \u201cLet Us Fight the Japanese Devils Together.\u201d\n\nBut short of abandoning the Japan-demonizing policy altogether, many remain doubtful that such \u201cvulgar and deviant\u201d kitsch on China\u2019s public airwaves will be effectively eliminated.\n\n\u2022 Miles Yu\u2019s column appears Fridays.
