WASHINGTON (AP) – In his first remarks about Donald Trump’s presumptive nominee status, President Barack Obama has a message for the media: “This is not entertainment. This is not a reality show.”

Obama is urging reporters to take Trump seriously and vet him thoroughly. At a brief news conference at the White House on Friday, Obama told reporters to scrutinize the candidates closely, to fact check their policies and to hold them to their past statements.

He says, “emphasizing the spectacle and the circus, that’s not something we can afford.”

Obama says if reporters do their job and people are well informed “I’m confident our democracy will work.”

Asked about Trump’s taco bowl tweet Thursday saying “I love Hispanics,” Obama said he wouldn’t comment on Trump’s twitter feed.
