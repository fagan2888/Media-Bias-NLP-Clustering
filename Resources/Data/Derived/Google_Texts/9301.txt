A new CBS television series was inspired by Hillary Clinton and Benghazi, the show’s producer announced this week at the Television Critics Association summer tour.

Lori McCreary, an executive producer for “Madam Secretary,” and Morgan Freeman had been in talks with CBS about coming up with a scripted series and had been “trying to come up with a great character” when the Hillary angle came up, Deadline Hollywood reported.

“And then, guess what happened — the Benghazi hearings,” McCreary said. She and Freeman then went back to the network with the idea of a series about what it’s like to be the female Secretary of State “and how it translates overseas when rights for women are not what they are here.”

“Madam Secretary” will star Téa Leoni as Elizabeth McCord, “the shrewd, determined, newly appointed Secretary of State who drives international diplomacy, battles office politics and circumvents protocol as she negotiates global and domestic issues, both at the White House and at home,” according to a CBS news release.

The show is set about five years in the future. McCreary did not mention whether or not the actual Benghazi attacks would be included in the series or if Hillary would have any sort of role in the show’s direction. Former secretary of state Madeleine Albright, however, will be involved with the production, according toDeadline.

Téa Leoni doesn’t bear too much of a likeness to Hillary, except in one area — their shared affinity for the pantsuit. The show’s trailer does indicate that her wardrobe and lack of style might come up over the course of the series.
