Trying to Muzzle Afghanistan\u2019s Watchdog?\n\nWhile the auditor\u2019s reports suggest that billions of tax dollars are being wasted, it is very rare that officials involved in running these programs face any direct consequences.\n\nIn the latest report, however, it appears that the auditors have finally had enough \u2013 they\u2019re calling for disciplinary action against three U.S. generals.\n\nSIGAR\u2019s new report accuses the generals of \u201cslow rolling\u201d the auditors investigation into a $36 million facility that was built and never used and likely never will be.\n\nThe auditors said that despite word from several generals on the ground that they didn\u2019t need the 64,000 sq. ft. command center at Camp Leatherneck, the generals fought to keep working on the project\u2014arguing that spending had already been authorized.\n\nAt the time, Maj. Gen. Peter M. Vangje, rejected the request to stop construction on the project.\n\nSIGAR accused Col. Norman Allen, an adviser of Gen. Joseph Dunford, the next Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, of intentionally blocking its investigation\u2014citing an email sent from Allen saying he wanted to \u201cslow roll\" the auditor\u2019s investigation into the building and the wasted money.\n\nRelated: $45 Billion in Tax Dollars Goes Missing in Afghanistan\n\nWhile SIGAR was conducting its investigation, Dunford apparently ordered an internal investigation, led by Maj. Gen. James Richardson, which concluded with a much rosier picture of the facility.\n\nThe auditors disagreed with DOD\u2019s assessment of their facility, and accused the authors of the report of \u201ccoaching\u201d officers how to respond to questions.\n\nThe revelation outraged lawmakers\u2014who are now demanding answers from the military on the wasted facility.\n\n\u201cThis is one of the most outrageous, deliberate and wasteful misuses of taxpayer dollars in Afghanistan we\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d said Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-MO), a ranking member of the Senate\u2019s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations.\n\nRelated: $45 Billion in Tax Dollars Goes Missing in Afghanistan\n\n\u201cWhen it was clear this building wouldn\u2019t be used, and when three commanders requested its cancellation, the Army not only built it anyway but completely failed to hold any officials accountable after all the facts came to light \u2026 so I\u2019ll now be fully expecting answers from the Army,\u201d McCaskill said in a statement.\n\nAllen responded to SIGAR\u2019s report saying he \u201cdisagreed with the characterization of my communication and actions.\u201d\n\nRegardless of the allegations of blocking the investigations, this isn\u2019t the first time a multi-million dollar project has been left abandoned in Afghanistan or elsewhere. The auditors recommended that the Pentagon develop a financial management strategy and get rid of the \u201cuse it or lose it\u201d approach.\n\nSeparately, SIGAR also recommended disciplinary action against the three generals, though did not specify what that would entail.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Nearly every week, the watchdog tasked with overseeing reconstruction in Afghanistan r", "title": "The Case for Punishing Incorrigible Generals for Wasting Another $36 Million", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/05/21/Case-Punishing-Incorrigible-Generals-Wasting-Another-36-Million", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/12062011_Defense_Cuts_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/05/21/Case-Punishing-Incorrigible-Generals-Wasting-Another-36-Million", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/12062011_Defense_Cuts_article.jpg", "creator": "@Briannaehley", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Nearly every week, the watchdog tasked with overseeing reconstruction in Afghanistan r", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce9d6\"", "article_summary": "SIGAR\u2019s new report accuses the generals of \u201cslow rolling\u201d the auditors investigation into a $36 million facility that was built and never used and likely never will be.\nThe auditors said that despite word from several generals on the ground that they didn\u2019t need the 64,000 sq.\nIn the latest report, however, it appears that the auditors have finally had enough \u2013 they\u2019re calling for disciplinary action against three U.S. generals.\nSeparately, SIGAR also recommended disciplinary action against the three generals, though did not specify what that would entail.\nft. command center at Camp Leatherneck, the generals fought to keep working on the project\u2014arguing that spending had already been authorized."}
