I soon found out that what I thought was a summer cold was actually Strep bacteria poisoning my blood stream. The bacteria blinded my left eye, ate a hole through my heart, caused five strokes on both sides of my brain and forced the removal of my prosthetic left knee.\u201d\n\nHoft appeared on the Glenn Beck Program Friday with guest host Dana Loesch, explaining how he has now become one of the millions (so far) to lose their health insurance in the aftermath of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cI get this notification that I\u2019m going to lose my insurance,\u201d he said. \u201cThis insurance that I bought, that I purchased, and I was paying a good premium, (and) covered most everything.\u201d\n\nHoft, who is still in a wheelchair, said he has a number of \u201cmajor surgeries\u201d in the near future and was \u201cvery pleased\u201d with his insurance of choice.\n\n\u201cSo to get this news on top of my recovery, on top of trying to make a living, has been obviously a very difficult thing to take on at this time,\u201d he said, the emotion clear in his voice.\n\nHoft has written about Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius\u2019 assertion that people who have lost their insurance are \u201cthrilled\u201d with the options they have available to them, and on Friday he repeated his message that she can \u201cgo to hell\u201d because that is \u201cabsolutely not true.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have the options I had,\u201d Hoft told Loesch. \u201cI pray to God that I get the same doctors, who saved my life three months ago. I pray that I\u2019ll be able to see them.\u201d\n\nThankfully, Hoft said, there are already \u201claws on the books\u201d ensuring that someone in his condition doesn\u2019t \u201cget kicked off\u201d their health insurance mid-treatment, but his health complications are not short-term.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just, again, something I really didn\u2019t want to suffer through at this time,\u201d he said.\n\nGateway Pundit\u2019s Jim Hoft added that the Affordable Care Act was \u201cbased on lies,\u201d and said he is one of the millions of Americans who is asking, \u201cwhy is our government doing this to us?\u201d\n\nHoft has scheduled a \u201cwheel-in rally\u201d outside Missouri Senator Claire McCaskill\u2019s (D) St. Louis office on Saturday from 11:00 p.m. to 12:00 p.m. in an effort to find out.\n\nHe stresses that while the focus of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s implementation has been the failed website, the website is not the issue \u2014 it is the law itself.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe that so many people still today are just taking this and sitting at home,\u201d he concluded, saying he hopes a few people join him on Saturday.\n\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nThe full episode of The Glenn Beck Program, along with many other live streaming shows and thousands of hours of on-demand content, is available on just about any digital device.
