There won\u2019t be a primary for this district, unfortunately: The political party leaders get to pick their favorite candidates \u2014 just like in the old days.\n\n\n\nAnd the big name at the top of the Republicans\u2019 list is also the most controversial: Staten Island district attorney Daniel Donovan. Mr. Donovan is best known nationally for failing to bring an indictment against the police officers who caused Eric Garner\u2019s death \u2014 all captured on a bystander\u2019s harrowing video.\n\nRepublicans deserve other choices. Assemblywoman Nicole Malliotakis and State Senator Andrew Lanza are possible alternatives, even though political insiders suggest they have little chance against Mr. Donovan when party leaders have the only vote.\n\nDemocrats, whose lackluster candidate last year failed against the flashy Mr. Grimm, are considering Assemblyman Michael Cusick, who lives in the area. Mr. Cusick is a relatively conservative lawmaker who works well with colleagues from both parties. Perhaps more important, he was a top aide to Senator Charles Schumer before becoming a legislator. With party regulars picking the candidate, Mr. Cusick\u2019s connection to the senior senator can only help.\n\nAnother strong Democrat is former Congressman Michael McMahon, who lost after one term to Mr. Grimm in 2010. As a former New York City Councilman, Mr. McMahon worked hard for such difficult issues as a fair waste management plan for the city. In Congress, he fought for more federal funds for transit and better mental health care for veterans. His unfortunate vote against the Affordable Care Act in 2010 could nevertheless help his credentials as a centrist for this district.\n\nNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo will have to call a special election very soon. Then it\u2019s up to voters to replace Mr. Grimm with someone who is less of a national embarrassment.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20150102163943, "BN": "takingnote", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "takingnote", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/takingnote/post", "per": "Grimm, Michael G", "keywords": "Grimm Michael G,Elections State Legislature,Staten Island (NYC),Uncategorized", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/takingnote/Who Will Replace Michael Grimm?
