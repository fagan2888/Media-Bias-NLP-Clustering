This time, rumors emerged that the talk show host\u2019s son didn\u2019t in fact have autism and that she was changing her stance on the effects of vaccines as a result. These rumors, she says, are \u201cblatantly inaccurate and completely ridiculous,\u201d according to CTV News.\n\nOn Friday, Radar Online published an article \u2014 which was taken down but can be seen here \u2014 about an interview McCarthy had with Time magazine, in which she spoke about her 11-year-old son no longer showing signs of autism \u2014 signs that usually persist with age in people with the disorder. Instead, the Time interview suggested that McCarthy\u2019s son had Landau-Kleffner syndrome, another childhood neurological disorder that affects language and speech, Radar wrote. In addition to these claims, Radar also said that McCarthy had changed her stance on MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccines, which she believes cause autism \u2014 despite continuous proof that they are safe. These claims, she says, are untrue.\n\n\u201cStories circulating online, claiming that I said my son Evan may not have autism after all, are blatantly inaccurate and completely ridiculous,\u201d she wrote in a Twitter post on Saturday. \u201cEvan was diagnosed with autism by the Autism Evaluation Clinic at the UCLA Neuropsychiatric Hospital and was confirmed by the State of California. The implication that I have changed my position, that my child was not initially diagnosed with autism (and instead may suffer from Landau-Kleffner syndrome), is both irresponsible and inaccurate.\u201d The Time magazine article, she continues, \u201cwas actually published in 2010,\u201d and it \u201cnever contained any such statements by me. \u2026 Please know that I am taking every legal measure necessary to set this straight.\u201d\n\nMcCarthy has been in and out of the public spotlight ever since she was cast as The View\u2019s newest host. She believes that her son\u2019s development of autism spectrum disorder was spawned by the onslaught of vaccines that he received when he was an infant. \u201cChildren are given so many shots from the moment they\u2019re born,\u201d she said in a 2009 interview with Time. \u201cThey get multiple injections all at once, and if they fall behind, doctors put them on a catch-up schedule.\u201d While some people blamed the mercury in vaccines \u2014 which is no longer present \u2014 for the onset of autism, McCarthy also said that \u201cother toxins play a role. The viruses in the vaccines themselves can be causing it too.\u201d\n\nMcCarthy\u2019s son was diagnosed with autism in 2005 after experiencing \u201clife-threatening seizures,\u201d McCarthy wrote in a 2008 CNN piece. However, after practicing alternative treatments, she says that he was cured. The author of the 2010 Time article suggested that her son might have had Landau-Kleffner syndrome, which is sometimes misdiagnosed as autism, The Huffington Post reports.\n\nThe latest rumors stirred up more debate among Reddit users regarding the safety of vaccinations, according to The Huffington Post. Sara McGinnis of BabyCenter believed that the 2010 Time article reemerged because \u201cpeople feel a wrong has occurred and are sharing the other side of the story as best they can to fight what they see as misinformation. If she\u2019s not going to openly talk about the possibility she and the diagnosis experts were wrong, others are.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "autism, the view, vaccinations, vaccines, mmr, landau-kleffner, twitter, time magazine, jenny mccarthy", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "\"The View\" host, Jenny McCarthy, shot down recent claims that she had changed her controversial stance on vaccinations, which she says cause autism in children.", "title": "Jenny McCarthy Shoots Down Rumors That She Changed Her Stance On Vaccines", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/jenny-mccarthy-calls-rumors-about-her-sons-autism-misdiagnosis-changing-stance-vaccines-blatantly", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/06/shutterstock105314945.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"The View\" host, Jenny McCarthy, shot down recent claims that she had changed her controversial stance on vaccinations, which she says cause autism in children.", "title": "Jenny McCarthy Shoots Down Rumors That She Changed Her Stance On Vaccines", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/jenny-mccarthy-calls-rumors-about-her-sons-autism-misdiagnosis-changing-stance-vaccines-blatantly", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/06/shutterstock105314945.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/06/shutterstock105314945.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-01-06T15:45:36-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-01-06T15:45:35-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "\"The View\" host, Jenny McCarthy, shot down recent claims that she had changed her controversial stance on vaccinations, which she says cause autism in children."}, "article_summary": "Instead, the Time interview suggested that McCarthy\u2019s son had Landau-Kleffner syndrome, another childhood neurological disorder that affects language and speech, Radar wrote.\nThis time, rumors emerged that the talk show host\u2019s son didn\u2019t in fact have autism and that she was changing her stance on the effects of vaccines as a result.\n\u201cEvan was diagnosed with autism by the Autism Evaluation Clinic at the UCLA Neuropsychiatric Hospital and was confirmed by the State of California.\nThe viruses in the vaccines themselves can be causing it too.\u201dMcCarthy\u2019s son was diagnosed with autism in 2005 after experiencing \u201clife-threatening seizures,\u201d McCarthy wrote in a 2008 CNN piece.\nThese rumors, she says, are \u201cblatantly inaccurate and completely ridiculous,\u201d according to CTV News."}
