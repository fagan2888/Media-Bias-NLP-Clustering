Aberdeen, SD

Hundreds of people received a Thanksgiving meal thanks to dozens of volunteers in Aberdeen Thursday.

About 70 volunteers took part in a Thanksgiving Day tradition at Bethlehem Lutheran Church. They provided a meal with potatoes, turkey and all the fixings for close to 400 people.

It took two sittings to fit all the people who took part in the meal; both filled. Volunteers also delivered about 50 meals.

The Miller family from Mina helped serve.

"I try to teach my children that they should be generous in giving back,” Don Miller said. “I'm very pleased to announce that this year was my daughter's idea."

"It just feels really good, you know, to see how happy it can make people just to be around other people and have people to spend a holiday with," Maddie Miller said.

The tradition at the Aberdeen church started 15 years ago. The meal first targeted people who might not have family in town.

"They wanted it with the table cloths and the people to feel like it's a house setting and that it can be family style. Maybe you've never met that person before but this is part of your family today and you sit down and enjoy your meal," coordinator Jodi Schwan said.

That setting has remained the same but now it serves a variety of people, including some who are working retail and don't have time to prepare a meal as store opening times have moved into Thursday.

Peggy Miller says she isn't too concerned about the big sales or whether her time here will keep her from any of them.

"Being here with family and helping others, that's what makes the day," Peggy Miller said.

Her eighth grade son agrees. Still, he plans to stand in line for a good deal on a new TV.

“Yeah for the man cave,” Matt Miller said.

But he won’t pursue that purchase until after his family's time volunteering for the holiday is done.

Coordinators say they don't have trouble finding volunteers to help. In fact, the church even had more people offer to help than needed this year.
