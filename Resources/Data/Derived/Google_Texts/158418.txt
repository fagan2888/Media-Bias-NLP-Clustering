(TRNS)- America’s Voice, an immigration reform advocacy group, enumerated concerns in a conference call held Tuesday on a sharp increase in prosecution of illegal immigrants under the Obama administration.

“The Department of Justice … has a very important role in the deportation mill, on the deportation process, that needs to be discussed, scrutinized, and ultimately reformed,” said Lynn Tramonte, Deputy Director of America’s Voice Education Fund.

She blames the Obama administration for not doing more to fix this process.

David Leopold, an Immigration Attorney from Cleveland, Ohio and Past President of American Immigration Lawyers Association, blames a push by the Department of Justice to appear tough on illegal immigration, without effectively differentiating between dangerous criminal immigrants and taxpaying ones with families who have been living in the U.S. for years.

Over half of all federal criminal prosecution is immigration, even above drug charges.

Attorney Andrew Nietor, an immigration and federal criminal defense attorney from San Diego and member of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, warns that the Justice System is currently wrapped up in a trend in which as many as 40 immigration cases are tried together in an effort to streamline cases, a situation that Nietor says leads to the unique qualities of each case slipping through the cracks. Often, immigrants are encouraged to plead guilty and serve 30 days, which waives their right to hear evidence against them or file motions.

Difficulties are expected to grow if Congress passes legislation that excludes immigrants with any type of felony record from the benefits of immigration reform.
