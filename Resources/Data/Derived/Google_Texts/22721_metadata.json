But the neural basis underlying the act of forgetting isn\u2019t well understood. A new study found that in roundworms, a protein called musashi is actively involved in forgetting. Just in time for the 10th anniversary of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.\n\nIn the study, published in the journal Cell, scientists found that roundworms that were genetically modified to lack the musashi protein did much better on a smell-based learning task, actively retaining memories 24 hours later that unmodified mice did not. This is one of the first studies to show that forgetting can be an active (as opposed to passive) process, the authors wrote.", "article_metadata": {"description": "New research helps explain how the brain protects us from memory-related disorders", "title": "Forgetting keeps us sane", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "New research helps explain how the brain protects us from memory-related disorders", "title": "Forgetting keeps us sane", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/03/21/new_study_forgetting_is_an_active_process_in_the_brain_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/11/brain_model2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "New research helps explain how the brain protects us from memory-related disorders", "title": "Forgetting keeps us sane", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/11/brain_model2.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Douglas Main", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Brain, Memory, Popular Science", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcacd8\"", "article_summary": "A new study found that in roundworms, a protein called musashi is actively involved in forgetting.\nTopics: Brain, Memory, Popular Science, Innovation News, Life News, NewsWhen it comes to maintaining sanity, forgetting is at least as important as remembering.\nThis is one of the first studies to show that forgetting can be an active (as opposed to passive) process, the authors wrote.\nBut the neural basis underlying the act of forgetting isn\u2019t well understood.\nWithout it, the constant stream of stimuli\u2013faces on the street, words read, items glanced at\u2013would quickly overwhelm the mind."}
