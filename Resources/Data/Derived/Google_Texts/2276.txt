Many women came together Saturday at the Northeast Conference Center for a workshop focusing on heart disease.

The Go Red for Women event focused on being active and learning different measures to prevent heart disease. Heart disease is the number one killer of women. Attendees learned statistics, prevention strategies and how many people are diagnosed each year. This is the first event like this but organizers say they hope to continue this every year and that more women will come out.

"We had several dietitians and physicians come in and we also talked about keeping our heart healthy," Delta Sigma Theta Sorority member Evelyn Acklin says.
