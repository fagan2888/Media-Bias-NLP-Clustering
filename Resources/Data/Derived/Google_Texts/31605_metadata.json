None of them won. So I\u2019m for none of the above. I\u2019m for Paul Ryan to be our nominee.\u201d\n\nNot exactly a clarion call, to be sure. But when you keep in mind that Boehner referred to Sen. Ted Cruz, the only guy with a realistic shot (and it\u2019s not that realistic) at defeating Donald Trump, as \u201cLucifer,\u201d the subtext is pretty clear:\n\nBoehner \u2026 had long whispered to friends that he believes Ryan could be the party\u2019s political savior if it came to that. But Boehner never said it publicly until now. In the same question-and-answer session here, Boehner referred to Ted Cruz as \u201clucifer.\u201d He previously called the Texas senator, who led the failed Republican effort to shut down the government over Obamacare, a \u201cjackass.\u201d\n\nRyan, for his part, has said he is not interested in being commander-in-chief. He says he \u201cconsciously\u201d decided not to seek the office, in fact.\n\nBut because Ryan didn\u2019t take a so-called \u201cShermanesque\u201d vow that he would rather be eaten alive by a pack of ravenous squirrels than accept the Republican Party\u2019s presidential nomination, some folks in the media have decided that what he really meant when he said he didn\u2019t want to run was, in fact, that he very much did.\n\nFor example, check out the way a writer at the Washington Post\u2019s \u201cThe Fix\u201d blog \u2014 a reliable font of conventional wisdom for those who cannot bear to wait until Sunday morning\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d \u2014 reacted to the Ryan interview. They don\u2019t make a mountain out of molehill so much as they erect a new tower of Babel from a grain of sand:\n\nRyan\u2019s interview is creating buzz \u2026 for two reasons: One, he\u2019s one of Republicans\u2019 undisputed leaders. He\u2019s the speaker of the House. He\u2019s in charge of presiding over the convention itself. And he\u2019s the party\u2019s 2012 vice presidential nominee.\n\nSo far, so good. All of those things are definitely literally true. What about the second reason, though?\n\n[T]wo, his interview with Harwood came as Donald Trump was in the process of sweeping at least three, and possibly four, of the five states voting in the GOP nominating process on Tuesday. The realization is sinking in among Republicans, Tuesday by Tuesday, that Trump is the most likely candidate to be their nominee (though a contested convention is also possible).\n\nHow does the Republican Party leadership\u2019s becoming (incredibly belated) aware that the man winning their presidential primary is likely to win their presidential primary lead to Ryan\u2019s \u201cno\u201d actually meaning \u201cyes\u201d? I honestly couldn\u2019t tell you; I only speak beginner\u2019s pundit, at best.\n\nThat said, the Fix is certainly right about this much: Donald Trump is in the best position, by far, to win the Republican Party\u2019s nomination \u2014 and GOP leadership has no idea what the hell they should do. It\u2019s also not outside the realm of possibility that some of them believe Ryan will, once again, take the job that no one else seems to want. So, sure, it\u2019s conceivable that a Draft Ryan movement could take hold.", "article_metadata": {"description": "John Boehner is laying the groundwork for a \"Draft Ryan\" campaign at the GOP convention.
