My children have a 50 percent chance of inheriting the mutation. My 22-year-old son recently noticed a breast lump and asked me to join him when he met with a surgical oncologist to be evaluated.\n\nThe surgeon performed a skillful physical exam but provided neither effective risk assessment nor empathetic counsel. Afterward, I sent an email to friends briefly explaining what had gone wrong during the appointment. \u201cWe want to know how you managed not to hit him,\u201d they asked. I did it by practicing restraint: slowly counting backwards from 10 and taking very deep breaths.\n\nHere\u2019s my countdown:\n\n10. I did not correct the icy-blue-eyed surgeon with steel-grey hair and steady hands \u2014 50? 60? \u2014 when he dissuaded my son from pursuing genetic testing. The surgeon had shaken my son\u2019s hand, looked him in the eye, and palpated my son\u2019s slender, muscular chest, identifying the small lump under my son\u2019s left nipple. A positive finding of a mutation, the surgeon said, adjusting the top of his surgical scrubs, could expose my son to discrimination in the workplace and in obtaining health insurance. That is, I did not say, \u201cThe scenario you describe is illegal in this country.\u201d As of March 23, 2010, with the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (aka \u201cObamacare\u201d), if anyone were to attempt to discriminate against this young man in the workplace or in the process of applying for health insurance because of a positive finding for a genetic mutation (a pre-existing condition), this person would be subject to a massive lawsuit.\n\n9. When this surgeon used the word \u201canxiety\u201d for the eighth time to a) describe my son and myself and b) provide his vision of a course of action, I did not refer this man to Leslie Jamison\u2019s collection of essays, \u201cThe Empathy Exams.\u201d \u201cEmpathy,\u201d writes Jamison, \u201cisn\u2019t just remembering to say that must really be hard \u2014 it\u2019s figuring out how to bring difficulty into the light so it can be seen at all. Empathy isn\u2019t just listening, it\u2019s asking the questions whose answers need to be listened to. Empathy requires inquiry as much as imagination. Empathy requires knowing you know nothing. Empathy means acknowledging a horizon of context that extends perpetually beyond what you can see\u2026\u201d\n\n8. I did not bring up this statistic: Though men make up only 1 percent of breast cancer diagnoses annually in the U.S., they may be up to 25 percent likelier than women to die from the disease, probably because of lack of awareness and late detection. Nor did I mention that generally male breast cancer presents with a detectable lump and is almost always linked to radiation exposure, unusually high levels of estrogen or a genetic mutation. Surely the surgeon knew these statistics? But my son did not. And I did not want to scare him.\n\n7. I said nothing to this surgeon\u2019s response to my son\u2019s question, \u201cBut wouldn\u2019t it be relevant to know if I carry the mutation?\u201d His answer: No, you know you have a family history of breast cancer.\n\n6. I said nothing when this surgeon dodged my son\u2019s question: \u201cIf my grandfather didn\u2019t have the mutation,\u201d my son wanted to know, \u201cwouldn\u2019t he not have had breast cancer? And wouldn\u2019t it be important for me to know if I carry the mutation, too, to assess my risk?\u201d The surgeon\u2019s reply: The only way you\u2019ll know if you have cancer is to have the lump removed. The surgeon\u2019s answer, while true, sidestepped the elephant in the room: whether my son carries a mutation elevating his risk of breast cancer.\n\n5. When this surgeon ridiculed an actress whose name he could not remember for publicly disclosing her status as a mutation carrier and for undergoing prophylactic mastectomies, I offered him the actress\u2019s name.\n\n4. This medical doctor derided women with family histories of breast cancer for seeking screening for genetic mutations linked to cancer and for pursuing prophylactic mastectomies when findings come back positive, calling the surgeries \u201cpossibly unnecessary\u201d and not proven to save lives. (Of course, this is exactly what I had done, but this surgeon wanted to make sure I didn\u2019t think he was criticizing me, in particular.) Still, I interjected only that I had made my decision a decade and a half before I\u2019d known who Angelina Jolie was and that I\u2019d had 5-year-old triplets to raise at the time. That is to say, I did not hit him.\n\n3. I did not mention that researcher Mary-Claire King, who first identified the BRCA 1 mutation, last year called for universal BRCA screening in young female populations with or without family histories of breast cancer as the most effective, even essential, method of cancer prevention. King described the BRCA 1 and 2 mutations as \u201cunambiguously damaging\u201d and reported that random genetic testing of patients diagnosed with breast and ovarian cancer turns up a 50 percent positive rate, regardless of family history. Nor did I point out that King has received international recognition for her work, including The Lasker Special Achievement Award in Medical Science, which \u201chonors scientists whose contributions to research are of unique magnitude and have immeasurable influence on the course of science, health, or medicine,\u201d while this surgeon \u2014 an M.D./Ph.D., a full professor of surgery and with almost 300 scientific publications \u2014 has not.\n\n2. When this surgeon asked whether my son and I would like his administrative assistant to contact us to schedule a follow-up appointment, I said, without the slightest hint of rage, \u201cNo, no, I think we can take it from here.\u201d\n\n1. I chose not to write a letter to this man\u2019s department chair explaining that, though he may be a brilliant researcher and excellent surgeon, he offered my son an opinion that was factually and legally irresponsible and could be repeating these mistakes in countless exam rooms every day, every week and every month, putting patients\u2019 health at risk.\n\nIn the end, my son subsequently chose to pursue genetic testing in a different medical setting. He is still awaiting his results.\n\nCathy Corman is a freelance writer, audio producer and lecturer in American studies and the Honors College at UMass Boston.\n\nClarification: Male breast cancer often presents with a detectable lump and is often linked to radiation exposure, unusually high levels of estrogen, or an underlying genetic mutation, such as BRCA 2.\n\nAn earlier version of this piece read, as follows: \u201c\u2026generally male breast cancer presents with a detectable lump and is almost always linked to radiation exposure, unusually high levels of estrogen or a genetic mutation.\u201d\n\nWe regret any confusion.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The surgeon performed a skillful physical exam but provided neither effective risk assessment nor empathetic counsel.", "og": {"site_name": "commonhealth", "description": "The surgeon performed a skillful physical exam but provided neither effective risk assessment nor empathetic counsel.", "title": "Practicing Restraint In A No-Empathy Zone: At The Cancer Surgeon\u2019s Office With My Son", "url": "http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2015/07/no-empathy-cancer-surgeon", "image": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/15/files/2015/07/cathy-corman-courtesy-620x827.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2015/07/no-empathy-cancer-surgeon", "image": "//s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/15/files/2015/07/cathy-corman-courtesy-620x827.jpg", "site": "@commonhealth", "card": "summary", "title": "Practicing Restraint In A No-Empathy Zone: At The Cancer Surgeon's Office With My Son"}, "DC.date.issued": "2015-07-22", "date": "Wed, 22 Jul 2015 13:14:24 -0400", "fb": {"admins": 1549080028, "app_id": 134067973330252}, "msvalidate.01": "D02D46BAEDB3F81FC1B1DE2A8CB69551"}, "article_summary": "Practicing Restraint In A No-Empathy Zone: At The Cancer Surgeon\u2019s Office With My SonCathy CormanGuest ContributorI carry a genetic mutation increasing my risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer.\nThe surgeon\u2019s answer, while true, sidestepped the elephant in the room: whether my son carries a mutation elevating his risk of breast cancer.\nMy 22-year-old son recently noticed a breast lump and asked me to join him when he met with a surgical oncologist to be evaluated.\nClarification: Male breast cancer often presents with a detectable lump and is often linked to radiation exposure, unusually high levels of estrogen, or an underlying genetic mutation, such as BRCA 2.\nI said nothing when this surgeon dodged my son\u2019s question: \u201cIf my grandfather didn\u2019t have the mutation,\u201d my son wanted to know, \u201cwouldn\u2019t he not have had breast cancer?"}
