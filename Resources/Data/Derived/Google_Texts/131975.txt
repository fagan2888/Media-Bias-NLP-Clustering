So, today is Donna Brazile’s birthday. Birthday wishes poured in on Twitter. The @JillBidenVeep account also offered its best wishes:

Happy Birthday @donnabrazile! — Jill Biden – SLOTUS (@JillBidenVeep) December 15, 2013

Ms. Brazile responded:

“@JillBidenVeep: Happy Birthday @donnabrazile!” Thanks so much. I love you and @JoeBiden. — Donna Brazile (@donnabrazile) December 15, 2013

Bless her heart? You see, there’s one problem: @JillBidenVeep is a parody account, as clearly indicated on its bio:

Hmm. Is Ms. Brazile befuddled (as happens fairly often)? She included @JoeBiden, which was the official Joe Biden campaign account. The vice president is now at @VP, however.

She may have fallen for this account before:

Donna does know this is a fake acct, rt? RT @donnabrazile RT @JillBidenVeep: I want to be like Michelle Obama when I grow up. #dnc2012 — Greg Pollowitz (@GPollowitz) September 6, 2012

Befuddled or playing along with the joke? Stay tuned!
