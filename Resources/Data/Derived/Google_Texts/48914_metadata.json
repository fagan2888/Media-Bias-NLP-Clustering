Judging by recent headlines, that sounds a bit like San Francisco and Silicon Valley. But it\u2019s actually Neptune, the fictional SoCal beach town that served as the setting for teen-detective noir Veronica Mars. The beloved series ran for three seasons before low ratings led to its 2007 cancellation, but this Friday, almost one year after a historic, multimillion-dollar Kickstarter campaign gave it new life, Veronica Mars returns to the big screen. (Or small screen, if you prefer\u2014the film will be available in on-demand formats for cautious newcomers or fans who prefer their Friday nights at home.) If the Veronica Mars movie is successful, it won\u2019t just be good news for creators of canceled cult-favorites looking to make their passion projects a reality. It\u2019ll also be a major endorsement for how Veronica Mars did teen drama: It featured a funny female lead with wise-beyond-her-years intelligence; a clever Heathers-esque takedown of high school social dynamics; a commitment to diversity that, while sometimes imperfect, included characters of all ethnicities, sexualities, gender identities, religions, and intellectual and physical abilities; and the most realistic depiction of rape and sexual assault on television. But as I\u2019ve been rewatching the series in anticipation of its return (which, in disclosure, I donated to), it\u2019s also become clear that, compared to similar shows of its time\u2014and, arguably, the rest of what\u2019s on television\u2014Veronica Mars had one of the most honest and sensitive portrayals of socioeconomic class differences.\n\nClass was a part of the show\u2019s DNA from the outset. After Veronica\u2019s best friend Lilly is murdered, Veronica\u2019s dad, the sheriff of Neptune, accuses Lilly\u2019s father of the crime. But he\u2019s the head of Kane Software, a company that invented streaming video and made half the town into instant millionaires, so Neptune turns on the Mars clan. Veronica\u2019s father is run out of office in a special election and becomes a private investigator, while Veronica, shunned by the popular kids she once called friends, copes by working for her dad (and secretly investigating who really killed Lilly). Related Story Veronica Mars, TV's Realest Depiction of Rape, Is Going to Be a Movie In the pilot, Veronica introduces her high school as a battle between the haves and the have-nots, claiming Neptune is a town without a middle class. \u201cIf you go here, your parents are either millionaires, or your parents work for millionaires,\u201d she says. But during its run, Neptunes proved to be far less divided, which not only made Neptune seem less like a distant fantasy town, but also allowed for more interesting subplots and nuanced character development. Veronica and her best friend Wallace, for example, are clearly (and later call themselves) middle-class: Veronica assists with her dad\u2019s caseload as an after-school job, but not because she\u2019s ordered to support the family\u2014the job gives her access to Lilly\u2019s murder files and helps her save up for Stanford (an ambition that\u2019s sometimes threatened by her quest for justice). Wallace\u2019s mom works for Kane Software, but she also relies on the income from her no-good tenant while Wallace counts on a basketball scholarship to be able to afford and attend his college of choice. Computer-whiz Mac is the Q to Veronica\u2019s 007, but while Mac buys a fancy car and keeps up with the latest gadgets and souped-up laptops, it\u2019s because she finds clever ways to use her tech know-how to earn cash, not because her parents dote on her with a checkbook. The show\u2019s careful attention to the material details of class also help contextualize Veronica herself: An ex-cheerleader, she distances herself from her old pals with a new haircut and new clothes, but preppy pink items from her past still show up in the first season, so viewers can tell she\u2019s not the girl who would (or could) prioritize buying an entirely new wardrobe. Years before Occupy Wall Street, 'Veronica Mars' critiqued the actions of the \u201c1 percent\u201d with an episode about an 09er parent\u2019s investment fraud and the members of the 99 percent that ultimately paid the price. Race and class are often intertwined in Neptune, but Veronica Mars often served as a good reminder that they\u2019re not to be conflated. One of the series\u2019 recurring conflicts is between the PCH Bike Club, a largely Latino motorcycle gang, and the obnoxious 09ers, rich kids from Neptune\u2019s \u00fcber-wealthy 90909 zip code, but the show never suggests only white kids can be rich kids and only minorities can be poor. Jackie Cook, a second-season addition played by Tessa Thompson, was both black and one of the richest girls in school. In one episode, while investigating a series of muggings, a classmate tips Veronica off that the culprit might be targeting the \u201ccoconuts\u201d\u2014Latino and Latina students criticized for being \u201cbrown on the outside, white on the side.\u201d The PCH gang does engage in criminal activity, but their crimes are repeatedly contrasted against the transgressions of the rich, which are often worse. And in Season Two, it\u2019s a rival gang made up of mostly working-class Irish-Catholics that\u2019s dealing the hard drugs (to the parents of 09ers) and making people \u201cdisappear.\u201d Veronica Mars didn\u2019t entirely subvert stereotypes, but it usually tried to at least complicate and challenge them.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The canceled teen-detective drama, which returns as a Kickstarter-funded movie Friday, asked tough questions about money and power that are still relevant today.", "author": "Nolan Feeney", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "The canceled teen-detective drama, which returns as a Kickstarter-funded movie Friday, asked tough questions about money and power that are still relevant today.", "title": "Veronica Mars: One of TV's Realest Depictions of Wealth Inequality", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2014/03/veronicamars/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2014/03/-em-veronica-mars-em-one-of-tvs-realest-depictions-of-wealth-inequality/284383/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbd1a\"", "article_summary": "If the Veronica Mars movie is successful, it won\u2019t just be good news for creators of canceled cult-favorites looking to make their passion projects a reality.\nBut it\u2019s actually Neptune, the fictional SoCal beach town that served as the setting for teen-detective noir Veronica Mars.\nRace and class are often intertwined in Neptune, but Veronica Mars often served as a good reminder that they\u2019re not to be conflated.\nRelated Story Veronica Mars, TV's Realest Depiction of Rape, Is Going to Be a Movie In the pilot, Veronica introduces her high school as a battle between the haves and the have-nots, claiming Neptune is a town without a middle class.\n\u201cIf you go here, your parents are either millionaires, or your parents work for millionaires,\u201d she says."}
