Bobby Jindal has decided that slamming Hillary Clinton‘s dishonesty about her emails will be a major talking point throughout his Iowa press tour. Jindal has said that with Clinton’s investigation by the FBI means that “she’s one email away from prison time,” and he suggested that she get some survival tips from one person in particular: Martha Stewart.

“Maybe her friend Martha Stewart can stop giving her interior decorating advice and give her jailhouse survival tips instead,” said Jindal. “Orange really will be the new black.”

Stewart famously served time in prison for insider trading, securities fraud, and other charges. Stewart has recently alluded to giving her support to Clinton, whose legal troubles reignited today with reports that there were two top secret emails on her private server.

Jindal also reportedly joked that Clinton’s emails might not be so secret, saying that the Chinese hackers allegedly responsible for OPM breach might’ve already seen them. “She’d better pray the Chinese government doesn’t do a document dump,” Jindal said.
