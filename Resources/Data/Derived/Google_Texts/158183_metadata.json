Little do they realize, he already is.\n\nWASHINGTON, February 27, 2016 \u2013 Exit polls in South Carolina and Nevada show that the iconoclast real estate billionaire and Republican candidate for president, Donald J. Trump, appeals to Americans across income groups, no matter their level of education or race \u2013 even among Nevada\u2019s Hispanic voters, where he took over 45% of that vote.\n\nIn a surprise move on Friday, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who abandoned his presidential bid after a lackluster showing in New Hampshire\u2019s primary, stood by Trump at a press conference in Fort Worth, Texas, describing him as the \u201cbest person to beat Hillary Clinton.\u201d\n\nBen Carson and Donald Trump reflect America\u2019s anger\n\nLong-time Republican political strategist Russ Schriefer wrote in Time Magazine:\n\n\u201cThe establishment talking point before Saturday was that Trump was winning only among lower-educated, blue-collar, disaffected voters\u2026 What the Internet did to newspapers, what Uber did to taxis\u2026 Donald Trump did to American politics\u2026 A former president, a sitting governor, a senator, even a former beloved first lady all endorsed candidates with little or no impact on the race.\u201d\n\nBut the best analysis of the current state of American politics appeared in the Wall Street Journal\u2019s editorial page (here). Columnist and former Republican presidential speech-writer Peggy Noonan says Trump\u2019s ascendancy represents the \u201crise of the unprotected,\u201d by which she means Americans \u201cwith limited resources and negligible access to power,\u201d who have \u201csuffered from illegal immigration \u2013 its impact on labor markets, financial costs, crime, the sense that the rule of law\u201d is collapsing.\n\nBut who are the \u201cprotected\u201d?\n\n\u201cThey are figures in government, politics and media. They live in nice neighborhoods, safe ones. Their families function, their kids go to good schools, they\u2019ve got some money. All of these things tend to isolate them, or provide buffers,\u201d writes Noonan.\n\nThese are the people that have been telling us since 2009 that America is out of recession. The same folks that say the financial burden on employers to comply with Obamacare, which has reduced many Americans to part-time status, is a blessing that relieves us from the affliction of \u201cjob lock.\u201d\n\nIn his final State of the Union Address as president, Obama asked,\n\n\u201cWill we respond to the changes of our time with fear, turning inward as a nation, and turning against each other as a people? Or will we face the future with confidence in who we are, what we stand for and the incredible things we can do together?\u201d\n\nLove him or hate him, Trump is brilliant\n\nAmericans aren\u2019t turning against each other or what we as Americans stand for. We are distancing ourselves from the nation\u2019s ruling elite, standing ready to dismantle a sham two-party system whose leaders are more interested in serving each other\u2019s interest than that of their long-suffering constituents.\n\nRepublican voters get to stick it to their GOP elites in the primaries, joining Chris Christie in standing by Trump.\n\nBlue-collar Democrats will do the same in the general election this November.\n\nRepublican apparatchiks fear that, if they manage to deny him the GOP presidential nomination at their convention this summer, Trump will run as a third-party candidate.\n\nThey fail to realize that Donald Trump, while a Republican, is already doing just that.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Donald J.
