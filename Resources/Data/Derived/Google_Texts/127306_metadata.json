Hobby Lobby Stores, one fact has become abundantly clear. We are belatedly realizing that different forms of freedom are more dependent on each other than many have hitherto supposed.\n\nWho would have thought that the welfare state\u2019s expansion in the guise of Obamacare\u2014which, by definition, significantly reduces economic freedom\u2014would directly impact the ability of individuals and groups to conduct their affairs in accordance with their deeply held religious beliefs? This, however, is precisely the reality confronting us.\n\nMost people are used to thinking of religious liberty as a prerequisite for political freedom. But religious freedom doesn\u2019t just concern our role as citizens in the public square. Religious liberty also concerns our freedom to choose in numerous non-political aspects of our lives, ranging from whether we attend church on a given day of the week, to what we choose to purchase.\n\nUnjust restrictions on religious liberty often come in the form of limiting the ability of members of particular faiths to participate fully in public life. Catholics in the England of Elizabeth I and James I, for instance, were gradually stripped of most of their civil and political rights because of their refusal to conform to the established Church.\n\nThe assault on their freedom, however, went beyond this. Perhaps even more damaging was the attack on their economic liberty. This came in the form of crippling fines being levied on recalcitrant Catholics by governments short on revenue, not to mention restrictions on Catholics\u2019 ability to own and use their property as they saw fit.\n\nMany such laws, Americans should never forget, crossed the Atlantic. Though the Maryland colony was founded by English Catholics fleeing religious repression, anti-Catholic laws similar to those in Britain eventually prevailed. As the most famous of Maryland Catholics, Charles Carroll of Carrollton\u2014the only Catholic to sign the Declaration of Independence and the wealthiest man in the American colonies\u2014observed, economic motives often underlay such harassment. \u201cSelfish men,\u201d he wrote, \u201cinvented the religious tests to exclude from posts of profit & trust their weaker or more conscientious fellow subjects.\u201d\n\nGenerally speaking, religious dissidents have proved remarkably adept at circumventing such restrictions. Indeed, there\u2019s some evidence that limiting a religious group\u2019s participation in political life often results in them focusing their talents upon economic success. Consider, for instance, the case of those perennial entrepreneurs: Arab Christians.\n\nUntil relatively recently, Christians were Lebanon\u2019s largest religious community. For centuries, they traded extensively with their co-religionists throughout the Mediterranean, thereby facilitating East-West commercial exchange. Besides geography, however, another cause of Middle Eastern Christians\u2019 commercial success may well have been the second-class legal status imposed upon them by their Muslim conquerors from the 7th century onwards.\n\nIn his History of the Arab Peoples, the late Albert Hourani relates that Christians (overwhelmingly Orthodox, Catholic, or Coptic) were forced to wear special clothes identifying them as non-Muslims. They were also obliged to pay a special tax, banned from carrying weapons, and sporadically persecuted. Hourani notes, however, that these constraints pushed many Christians into commercial endeavors. Eventually they dominated many economic spheres, including merchant shipping and banking.\n\nA similar tale can be told about the Jewish people. In the not-so-recent past, being Jewish meant you couldn\u2019t participate in politics or serve in the military and civil service in the Christian and Islamic worlds. Many Jews were consequently left with little else to do but create wealth.\n\nOne piece of good news\u2014and further evidence of freedom\u2019s indivisibility\u2014is the way in which expansions of economic freedom can create pressures for enhanced religious liberty. Mainland China is perhaps the best example.\n\nOver the past thirty years, China has embraced some economic freedom. Less known is that it\u2019s in those Chinese provinces permitted to somewhat liberalize their economies that millions of Chinese have embraced Christianity.\n\nThis shouldn\u2019t surprise us. Once you grant liberty in one area, it\u2019s hard to preclude freedom from spreading to other spheres. Economic liberty, for instance, requires and encourages people to think and choose freely. Without this, entrepreneurship is impossible. It\u2019s challenging, however, to limit this reflection and choosing to economic questions. People start asking social questions, political questions, and, yes, religious questions. And many Chinese have decided Christianity is the answer to their religious ponderings.\n\nThat has created acute dilemmas for China\u2019s rulers. On the one hand, the regime claims to value the contribution of many religions\u2019 strict moral codes to economic life. President Xi Jinping has publicly stated that China is \u201closing its moral compass\u201d and that \u201ctraditional\u201d Chinese faiths such as Confucianism and Taoism could \u201chelp fill a void that has allowed corruption to flourish.\u201d\n\nBut the regime also knows Christianity denies that the state can exercise religious authority over the church. Such a claim is unacceptable to China\u2019s present rulers. Why? Because it implicitly challenges the ruling elite\u2019s monopoly of power. Hence we see the regime persecuting Catholics who insist upon loyalty to the pope. In one of China\u2019s wealthiest eastern provinces, Zhejiang, Evangelical churches are being told to remove their crosses and threatened with having their buildings demolished.\n\nAs social scientists rightly remind us, correlation doesn\u2019t mean causation. The fact, however, that many Evangelical preachers in this economically successful and increasingly Christian Chinese province are publicly telling the authorities to back off tells us that once the freedom-genie is out of the bottle, it\u2019s tricky to put it back in.\n\nPlainly, religious freedom isn\u2019t yet a reality in China. But thanks partly to China\u2019s haphazard market-liberalization, its flourishing seems less far off. How sadly ironic it would be if we in the West\u2014the birthplace of religious freedom\u2014allow secular-progressivism\u2019s steady chipping-away at economic freedom, in the name of an impossible-to-realize equality of starting point, middle point and end point, to reduce the first and most fundamental of freedoms to a relic of our history.\n\nThis article first appeared at The American Spectator.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Whichever way the United States Supreme Court rules on Sebelius v.
