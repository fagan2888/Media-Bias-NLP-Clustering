Marketplace plans provide four standard levels of coverage, or \u201cmetallic tiers\u201d of coverage. These tiers were intended to allow consumers to compare plans with different levels of coverage for essential health benefits (EHB). Currently, there are bronze, silver, gold and platinum plans. Last month, a group of U.S. senators and insurers proposed adding a \u201ccopper\u201d plan to the bottom of the metallic tiers.\n\nBackground on the Metallic Tiers\n\nIn the past, it was hard to understand the coverage levels of plans. That\u2019s no longer the case. As of 2014, individual health insurance plans are categorized in four standardized levels of coverage, called \u201cmetallic tiers of coverage.\u201d These categories help to better compare plans \u201capples to apples.\u201d\n\nThe bronze plan has an actuarial value of 60 percent. Individuals will be required to pay 40 percent of their expected medical expenses via deductibles, co-payments, and coinsurance.\n\nThe silver plan has an actuarial value of 70 percent. Individuals will be required to pay 30 percent of their expected medical expenses via deductibles, co-payments, and coinsurance.\n\nThe gold plan has an actuarial value of 80 percent. Individuals will be required to pay 20 percent of their expected medical expenses via deductibles, co-payments, and coinsurance.\n\nThe platinum plan has an actuarial value of 90 percent. Individuals will be required to pay 10 percent of their expected medical expenses via deductibles, co-payments, and coinsurance.\n\nSource: Affordable Care Act 101\n\nWhy Introduce a Copper Plan?\n\nThe idea behind the introduction of a copper plan is to try and attract individuals who have not purchased health insurance yet due to the cost. Additionally, proposers of the copper plan argue that introducing a copper tier may encourage individuals who have already enrolled in a Marketplace plan to re-assess their healthcare options for 2015.\n\nThe proposed copper plans would be situated at the bottom of the metallic tier (below bronze). The plans would have a significantly lower premium, but would cover only 50 percent of an individual's expected medical expenses. This leaves the individual responsible for the remaining 50 percent via deductibles, co-payments, and coinsurance.\n\nAlthough introducing a plan with a lower premium may seem like an attractive idea to some (consumers, insurers, and proposers of the plan), others are arguing differently. Opposers of the introduction of a copper plan point out that although the premium may be more affordable, if an individual ever had to use their plan, they could get stuck with an extremely costly deductible.\n\nOther opposers of the copper plan argue that a low-premium high-deductible plan would not have the appeal that copper plan proposers intend. Only 20 percent of Marketplace enrollees selected a bronze plan. Of the Marketplace enrollees, 65 percent selected a silver plan, which was by far the most popular.\n\nSince the average Marketplace plan only costs $82 a month when premium tax credits are taken into account, a low-premium high-deductible plan may seem less appealing to enrollees than anticipated.\n\nWhat do you think about the introduction of a copper plan into the metallic tiers?
