Family members have identified a 78-year-old man who died after collapsing at Steamboat Ski Area.

Nicole Holmes tells Steamboat Today that her father, Gustav "Gus" Herstik, was participating in the NASTAR National Championships on Thursday when he fell. He died at a nearby hospital, and investigators with the Routt County Sheriff's Office think he had a medical issue.

Holmes says the family already misses Herstik, "but we all honestly couldn't think of any better way for him to leave us. He loved skiing and his racing."

Another skier in his 70s was taken off the mountain Friday and required CPR. Fire Chief Mel Stewart says the skier was stabilized at Yampa Valley Medical Center and was flown to another hospital for advanced treatment.
