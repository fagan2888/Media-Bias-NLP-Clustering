A government internal document revealed that approximately 22,000 people have filed appeals for errors they experienced during the enrollment process, but the appeals have gone unanswered.\n\nMost of the appeals state that enrollees were charged too much for health insurance when signing up for the federal online marketplace, or that they were steered into the wrong program, or that the coverage was denied.\n\nAccording to state Medicaid officials and those at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, consumers are dealing with what have been dubbed \u201cloopers.\u201d These are instances where individuals apply for health coverage and are told that they qualify for Medicaid, but when those individuals report to their state Medicaid agency, they are told that they in fact do not qualify for Medicaid and must pursue private health insurance through the marketplace.\n\nA letter from the National Health Law Program cites other issues. For example, a North Carolina family was declared eligible for subsidies to purchase private policies and told that their son was eligible for the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), but that their daughter was eligible for nothing.\n\nIt appears, however, that these issues will not be addressed in the near future. The Washington Post reports, \u201cFor now, the appeals are sitting, untouched, inside a government computer. And an unknown number of consumers who are trying to get help through less formal means \u2014 by calling the healthcare marketplace directly \u2014 are told that HealthCare.gov\u2019s computer system is not yet allowing federal workers to go into enrollment records and change them.\u201d\n\nNaturally, consumers are experiencing frustration.\n\nOne consumer, Addie Wilson, 27, earns $22,000 per year doing social work. Wilson asserts that she is paying $100 a month more for her health insurance than she should be and that her deductible is $4,000 too high.\n\nWilson was forced to sign up for health insurance on HealthCare.gov in late December by circumstance, as her old insurance was ending, and she was scheduled to have gallbladder surgery in January.\n\nStruck with panic, she did her best to sign up for insurance on the website, but realized that the site was calculating a different federal subsidy than that which she knew she was entitled under the law. She called a federal call center and was told to pay the full price for now and appeal it later.\n\nShe took that advice, a decision she is now regretting.\n\n\u201cIt is definitely frustrating and not fair,\u201d Wilson opines. \u201cI hope they really work on getting this fixed.\u201d\n\nConsumers are supposed to be able to file appeals through a variety of options, including computer, phone, or mail, but at the moment, mail is the only option. Those 22,000 people who have filed appeals have had to do so by filling out a seven-page form and mailing it to a federal office in Kentucky, where the forms are supposed to be scanned and entered into a computer system. At this point in time, that is where the process ends, since agency workers are unable to read and handle the appeals.\n\nOfficials who are faced without an option to address the appeals are instructing individuals to return to the website and start over.\n\n\u201cWe are inviting those consumers back to Healthcare.gov, where they can reset and successfully finish their applications without needing to complete the appeals process,\u201d said a CMS spokesman.\n\nThe failure of the healthcare appeals system is something which the Obama administration has been very discreet about, even as legal advocates have been calling upon officials to be sure to accommodate the due process rights of consumers who are entitled to timely hearings.\n\nBut at the moment, \u201cthere is no indication that infrastructure ... necessary for conducting informal reviews and fair hearings has even been created, let alone become operational,\u201d attorneys at the National Health Law Program said in a late December letter to leaders of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), which oversees the healthcare website.\n\nA CMS spokesman, Aaron Albright, said, \u201cWe are working to fully implement the appeals system.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately for frustrated consumers, there is no clear end in sight.\n\nThe Post writes, \u201cThree knowledgeable individuals, speaking on the condition of anonymity about internal discussions, said it is unclear when the appeals process will become available. So far, it is not among the top priorities for completing parts of the federal insurance exchange\u2019s computer system that still do not work.\u201d\n\nIssues that still require correction on the healthcare site include the electronic payment system, the exchange of enrollment information with state Medicaid programs, and the ability to adjust people\u2019s coverage to accommodate changes such as new babies, marriage, etc.\n\nStill, Albright assures that the appeals will be addressed.\n\n\u201cAs we work to fully implement the appeals system, CMS is working directly with consumers to address concerns they have raised through this process,\" he said.\n\nHowever, he did not indicate when the computer program to process those appeals is expected to be completed, nor did he declare with whom each contractor was working to correct the problem, since the administration recently selected the consulting firm Accenture to replace CGI as the lead contractor responsible for the website\u2019s continuing construction, reports CBS News.\n\nDeclaring that most of the front-end problems with the website have been resolved, the Obama administration has revamped its efforts to encourage more people to enroll in insurance via the site.\n\nThe Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services \u201chas been reaching out to consumers who applied for coverage but have not yet selected a plan by email, phone and hard mail, to let them know about the next steps to complete enrollment,\u201d an administration official said. \u201cBroader outreach and enrollment efforts will ramp up next year to help more Americans sign up for coverage throughout the open enrollment period, which goes through March 31, 2014.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, President Obama adamantly defended his choice to keep HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius on the job in an interview with Fox News\u2019 Bill O\u2019Reilly, even after the healthcare website\u2019s disastrous launch in October.\n\n\u201cWe hold everybody up and down the line accountable, but when we\u2019re midstream, Bill, we want to make sure that our main focus is how do we make this thing work so people are able to sign up,\u201d the president told O\u2019Reilly.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nObamaCare Website Plagued by Security Problems\n\nObamaCare: the Plan is to Transition to Single-payer Socialized Medicine\n\nObama Knowingly Lied About Keeping Health Plans Under ObamaCare\n\nObamaCare Enrolling Vastly More in Medicaid Than in Private Insurance", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "ObamaCare, appeals, healthcare.gov, insurance, Obama, Medicaid, enrollment, errors", "og": {"url": "http://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/health-care/item/17548-obamacare-appeals-process-yet-another-failure", "type": "article", "description": "Roughly 22,000 ObamaCare enrollees filed appeals for errors experienced during enrollment, but the appeals have gone unanswered. by Raven Clabough", "title": "ObamaCare Appeals Process: Yet Another Failure"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3162\"", "article_summary": "A government internal document revealed that approximately 22,000 people have filed appeals for errors they experienced during the enrollment process, but the appeals have gone unanswered.\nThe Post writes, \u201cThree knowledgeable individuals, speaking on the condition of anonymity about internal discussions, said it is unclear when the appeals process will become available.\n\u201cWe are inviting those consumers back to Healthcare.gov, where they can reset and successfully finish their applications without needing to complete the appeals process,\u201d said a CMS spokesman.\n\u201cAs we work to fully implement the appeals system, CMS is working directly with consumers to address concerns they have raised through this process,\" he said.\nAt this point in time, that is where the process ends, since agency workers are unable to read and handle the appeals."}
