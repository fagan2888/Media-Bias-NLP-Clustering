I\u2019m pretty proud of myself. (It\u2019s) the first time I\u2019ve ever been up there in the final group. To be able to bring it home \u2026 I did really well. It wasn\u2019t too long ago that I was pretty low with my game. I couldn\u2019t get out of my own way. This never would have been possible two years ago.\u201d\n\nThe Houston Open was the final opportunity for players to get into the Masters, and Herman seemed like a long shot at No. 191 in the world whose only professional victory was six years ago at the Moonah Classic in Australia.\n\nStenson missed an 18-foot birdie putt on the last hole for a 68 to finish one shot behind. It was the Swede\u2019s eighth runner-up finish since his last victory in Dubai at the end of 2014.\n\n\u201cYou can play well and still lose,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to put any (extra) pressure on myself. I wasn\u2019t given the tournament. I had to play 9 under on the weekend to win it.\u201d\n\nDustin Johnson tried to overcome a double bogey on the 11th hole. He made three birdies coming in, but had to settle for a 69 and was two shots back.\n\nJordan Spieth made four straight birdies early in his round, but two shots into the water led to double bogeys and a 70. He was seven back in a tie for 13th.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Herman wins Houston Open to get into the Masters", "title": "Herman wins Houston Open to get into the Masters", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Herman wins Houston Open to get into the Masters", "title": "Herman wins Houston Open to get into the Masters", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/04/04/herman_wins_houston_open_to_get_into_the_masters/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/04/houston-open-golf.jpeg7-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Herman wins Houston Open to get into the Masters", "title": "Herman wins Houston Open to get into the Masters", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/04/houston-open-golf.jpeg7-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "This never would have been possible two years ago.\u201dThe Houston Open was the final opportunity for players to get into the Masters, and Herman seemed like a long shot at No.\nHerman tapped in for par and thrust both fists in the air after his one-shot victory over Henrik Stenson.\nTopics: From the Wires, Entertainment News, NewsHUMBLE, Texas (AP) \u2014 Jim Herman delivered a masterful performance at just the right time Sunday in the Shell Houston Open.\n\u201cThis is pretty unreal,\u201d Herman said, admitting he had to go through Q school seven times before sticking on the Tour.\nHe made three birdies coming in, but had to settle for a 69 and was two shots back."}
