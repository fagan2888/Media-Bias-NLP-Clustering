There is one day that is not like the rest of days, because it highlights the importance of a grave yet fundamental factor of humanity.\n\nWorld Suicide Prevention Day is an annual reminder to humanity of the precious value of one\u2019s life, and has been designated since 2003.\n\nWhile individuals and societies may have opposing views concerning different issues in life, one common truth unites all the disparate groups: each individual\u2019s ultimate death. However, death is unpredictable; many people choose to put an end to their lives, while others seem to die sooner than they expect.\n\nSuicide is the solution?\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) defines suicide as \u201cthe act of deliberately killing oneself. Risk factors for suicide include mental disorder (such as depression, personality disorder, alcohol dependence, or schizophrenia), and some physical illnesses, such as neurological disorders, cancer, and HIV infection. There are effective strategies and interventions for the prevention of suicide.\u201d\n\nIn 2014, the WHO released the World Suicide Report, which \u201ccommits all 149 states to reducing their suicide rates by 10% by 2020,\u201d according to the International Association for Suicide Prevention (IASP).\n\nThe IASP considers suicide as \u201ca major public health problem.\u201d Statistics reveal that \u201csuicide worldwide was estimated to represent 1.3% of the total global burden of disease in 2004,\u201d according to IASP. Studies link the rising rates of suicide to delinquency and depression.\n\nThe 2014 World Suicide Prevention Day\u2019s motto is \u201cSuicide Prevention: One World Connected.\u201d The key word in this theme is \u201cconnect.\u201d What makes an individual choose to leave the world behind? It is often perhaps the lacking feeling of being connected and the sense of belonging to a group. It seems that Living on the margin of society is likely to increase the risk of suicide attempts. Social isolation is not merely physical, but rather emotional and psychological; this explains why some celebrities, who constitute the center of many social spheres, nevertheless choose to take their own lives.\n\nThis year\u2019s World Suicide Prevention Day emphasizes the notion of connectedness as an invaluable strategy of suicide prevention that should be employed in media, social, political and state levels in order to make sure individuals who are likely subject to commit suicide receive the necessary support.\n\nMost people who suffer from mental disorder do not necessarily commit suicide, but most suicidal attempts could be the outcome of a mental illness.\n\nDifferent forms of mental disorder lead to suicide including major depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, substance abuse and risks are high when these disorders are combined with depression.\n\nWhy does it have to be too late for people to treat depression? How come scientific research evolves one year after another and nothing seems to be done to heal these conditions?\n\nWhile the world is busy building peace in different parts of the world, people should consider finding inner peace as a prerequisite condition to communicate positive effect with humanity. The World Suicide Prevention Day is a reminder of the importance of living in a connected world and that one suicidal attempt is a threat to humanity.\n\nThe butterfly effect of suicidal thoughts start from very small incidents or ideas, if not treated at an early stage in most cases, a funeral is scheduled down the road.\n\nEdited by Melissa Smyth.
