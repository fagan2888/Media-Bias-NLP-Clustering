The marketplace was established as part of the Affordable Care Act to increase access to health insurance.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking forward to helping more people enroll in health plans that they can afford and that will best meet their needs,\u201d said KAMU spokesperson Katrina McGivern.\n\nKAMU\u2019s grant is for $516,000 a year for three years, while Ascension Health will receive $247,000 a year for three years.\n\nBetween November 2014 and February 2015, KAMU-sponsored navigators helped more than 15,300 Kansans buy insurance and Ascension Health-sponsored navigators helped 4,000.\n\nAscension Health is the nation's largest Catholic nonprofit health system. Its Kansas holdings include the Via Christi Health hospitals in Wichita and Pittsburg, Mercy Regional Health Center in Manhattan and Wamego Health Center in Wamego, as well as several clinics throughout the state.\n\n\u201cThis is going to allow us to help individuals throughout the Kansas community get coverage and, in the long run, get the screenings and prevention services they need to catch cancers earlier,\u201d said Maggie Ward, who oversees Ascension Health\u2019s navigators in Kansas.\n\nAscension Health\u2019s navigators, she said, make sure their patients understand that under the Affordable Care Act, insurance plans are required to cover cancer screenings and preventive treatments.\n\n\u201cHopefully this will help us catch problems long before (patients) wind up in the hospital with a significant disease,\u201d Ward said.\n\nAscension Health, she said, plans to use a portion of its grant to develop webinars and expand its teleconferencing abilities.\n\nKAMU, McGivern said, will use its grant to hire 15 full-time navigators prior to the Nov. 1 start of the 2015-2016 open enrollment period.\n\nA \u201cspecial emphasis,\u201d she said, will be placed on reaching out to the 341,000 Kansans who are currently uninsured.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re also going to host 10 \u2018Cover Kansas\u2019 open-enrollment events where navigators in a particular area \u2014 Wichita, for example \u2014 will all come together and be available at the same time,\u201d McGivern said.\n\nThough KAMU represents the state\u2019s safety net clinics, it administers its grant on behalf of the Cover Kansas Consortium. That group includes the Kansas Hospital Education and Research Foundation, Kansas Association of Local Health Departments, Association of Community Mental Health Centers of Kansas, Kansas Health Reform Project and the Kansas Association of Area Agencies on Aging and Disabilities.\n\nKAMU and Ascension Health were awarded navigator grants in 2013 and 2014.\n\nKansas is one of 34 states dividing more than $67 million in navigator grants this year.\n\nIn Missouri, three organizations received navigator grants: Missouri Alliance of Area Agencies on Aging, which serves 110 counties and got $891,095; Planned Parenthood of St. Louis, which got $388,787; and St. Louis Effort for AIDS, Inc., which got $545,704.\n\nDave Ranney is a reporter for KHI News Service in Topeka, a partner in the Heartland Health Monitor team.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health", "description": "The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced Wednesday that it had renewed its navigator grants with two Kansas programs: Ascension Health and", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://kcur.org/post/kansas-navigator-grants-renewed-three-years", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/kcur/files/styles/medium/public/201509/HealthInsurance.JPG", "type": "article", "description": "The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced Wednesday that it had renewed its navigator grants with two Kansas programs: Ascension Health and", "title": "Kansas Navigator Grants Renewed For Three Years"}, "story_id": 437320866, "twitter": {"site": "@kcur", "card": "summary", "creator": "@kcur"}, "author": "Dave Ranney", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Kansas Navigator Grants Renewed For Three Years"}, "nid": 78483, "datePublished": "2015-09-03", "keywords": "Affordable Care Act, Heartland Health Monitor", "wordCount": 600, "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce5cf\"", "article_summary": "That group includes the Kansas Hospital Education and Research Foundation, Kansas Association of Local Health Departments, Association of Community Mental Health Centers of Kansas, Kansas Health Reform Project and the Kansas Association of Area Agencies on Aging and Disabilities.\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced Wednesday that it had renewed its navigator grants with two Kansas programs: Ascension Health and the Kansas Association for the Medically Underserved (KAMU).\nKansas is one of 34 states dividing more than $67 million in navigator grants this year.\nKAMU and Ascension Health were awarded navigator grants in 2013 and 2014.\nIn Missouri, three organizations received navigator grants: Missouri Alliance of Area Agencies on Aging, which serves 110 counties and got $891,095; Planned Parenthood of St. Louis, which got $388,787; and St. Louis Effort for AIDS, Inc., which got $545,704."}
