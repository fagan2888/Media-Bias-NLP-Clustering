(Photo: SUBMITTED)\n\nThe signatures of Volunteer State Community College faculty, staff and donors are now a permanent part of the new $30 million Humanities Building, currently under construction on the Gallatin campus.\n\nPeople had the opportunity to sign a beam that was used during a topping-off ceremony for the new building recently. The beam was then raised by a crane and bolted into place.\n\nThe three-story structure is officially named the Steinhauer-Rogan-Black Humanities Building. Lead gift donors Dr. David and U.S. Congressman Diane Black, who gave $1 million for the project, decided to share the naming with two well-known Sumner County families, John and Jane Steinhauer and Marion and Clara Rogan.\n\nConstruction is due to be completed in summer of 2016. When finished, the 88 thousand square foot facility will have 44 classrooms and labs, 56 faculty offices, a recording studio, music practice rooms and an art gallery.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://tnne.ws/1EbrwCf", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "$30 million building named for Dr. David and Congressman Diane Black, John and Jane Steinhauer, and Marion and Clara Rogan.", "og": {"site_name": "The Tennessean", "description": "$30 million building named for Dr. David and Congressman Diane Black, John and Jane Steinhauer, and Marion and Clara Rogan.", "title": "Vol State tops off humanities building", "url": "http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/local/sumner/2015/08/22/vol-state-topping-ceremony-humanities/32046479/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/tennessean.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "$30 million building named for Dr. David and Congressman Diane Black, John and Jane Steinhauer, and Marion and Clara Rogan.", "title": "Vol State tops off humanities building", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/df98413a770709437c6466f022d986ab80df0232/c=864-0-4320-3456&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/08/20/Nashville/B9318528674Z.1_20150820110447_000_GRABM90HM.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@tennessean", "site": "@tennessean", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600028886", "fb": {"app_id": 121487414583460}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Persons/Diane Black", "gci-asset-type": "data", "gci-categories": "Persons/Diane Black", "title": "Vol State tops off humanities building", "author": "readersubmitted", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/local/sumner", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/07685c83f895bf0c6199e8efe706d3aae1292b26/c=1296-0-3888-3456/local/-/media/2015/08/20/Nashville/B9318528674Z.1_20150820110447_000_GRABM90HM.1-0.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ebf1a7a0cbe37ff421bdfb019e9283f02cf642ff/c=864-0-4320-3456/local/-/media/2015/08/20/Nashville/B9318528674Z.1_20150820110447_000_GRABM90HM.1-0.jpg", "contenttype": "data", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3a3d056d2f4b50884acd36c237db6d171e941ff0/c=288-0-4896-3456/local/-/media/2015/08/20/Nashville/B9318528674Z.1_20150820110447_000_GRABM90HM.1-0.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2a6573745064622162eb3405ad5bd1daa4942810/c=0-270-5184-3186&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2015/08/20/Nashville/B9318528674Z.1_20150820110447_000_GRABM90HM.1-0.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-08-22T09:06:00.517000-05:00", "shorthed": "Vol State tops off humanities building", "articleid": 32046479, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3658fd42755583d64b04f69690f6d4a6f28401aa/c=0-270-5184-3186/local/-/media/2015/08/20/Nashville/B9318528674Z.1_20150820110447_000_GRABM90HM.1-0.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ed8bc1413d2cc061d591d579e7a65f8870c7ae19/c=1620-0-3564-3456/local/-/media/2015/08/20/Nashville/B9318528674Z.1_20150820110447_000_GRABM90HM.1-0.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": "diane black, vol state community college, sumner county tennessee, higher education"}, "article_summary": "Annette Wagner, assistant director of admissions at Vol State, signs a beam for the college\u2019s new humanities building during a recent ceremony on campus.\nThe three-story structure is officially named the Steinhauer-Rogan-Black Humanities Building.\n(Photo: SUBMITTED)The signatures of Volunteer State Community College faculty, staff and donors are now a permanent part of the new $30 million Humanities Building, currently under construction on the Gallatin campus.\nPeople had the opportunity to sign a beam that was used during a topping-off ceremony for the new building recently.\nThe beam was then raised by a crane and bolted into place."}
