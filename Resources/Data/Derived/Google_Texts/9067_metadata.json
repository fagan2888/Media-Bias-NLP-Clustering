Breitbart Texas has learned that Catholic Charities\u2019 St. Jerome\u2019s Home for Children, located in Fort Bend County, is providing many benefits including financial support, English classes, legal assistance, and release services to youths in the U.S. illegally. The charity is looking to hire several staff members to help accommodate the influx of migrants.\n\nSt. Jerome\u2019s webpage reads, \u201cWhile the youth are living in this home, evaluations are provided to assess all their needs (medical, psychiatric/therapeutic, educational, vocational, social, familial, legal) with the development of an initial service plan.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter these assessments are completed, a decision about a long-term placement is made in the best interest of the youth,\u201d it continues. \u201cIf appropriate, the youth moves to live with an individual foster family. Otherwise, the youth remains in the agency foster home. If a youth is not able to maintain the foster family placement, he or she returns to the agency home to live until discharge.\u201d\n\nThe programs administers \u201cfinancial assistance\u201d for the foreigner\u2019s housing, food, clothing, and other necessities. It additionally provides case management by social workers, vocational training, English lessons, and legal assistance.\n\nIt appears that the program\u2019s ultimate goal is to place unaccompanied minors in U.S. foster homes.\n\nIn order to accommodate the migrants staying at St. Jerome\u2019s, Catholic Charities is currently seeking new paid staff members. Job listings for a lifeguard, bilingual recreation specialist, transition to adulthood case manager, and several youth care workers all appear online.\n\n\u201cOur competitive benefits package includes health, dental, vision, long-term disability, life insurance, FLEX plan, 401(k), and an Employee Assistance Program (EAP). Catholic Charities is an equal opportunity employer,\u201d Catholic Charities claims on its employment webpage.\n\nThe organization is known for receiving a bulk of its funding from the U.S. government. In 2010 alone, it received $2.9 billion from the federal government, about 62 percent of its annual revenue.\n\nThe organization could soon receive significant funds from the federal government; the Department of Health and Human Services recently announced a \u201cfunding opportunity\u201d of $350 million for \u201cresidential care providers\u201d for minors in the U.S. illegally.
