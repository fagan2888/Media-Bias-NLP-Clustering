Shareholders approved the transaction last month.\n\nUntil last week, Belk had been the nation\u2019s largest family-owned and -operated department store, with $4 billion in annual sales at almost 300 locations in 16 Southern states.\n\nThe retailer was started in 1888 by William Henry Belk, who opened a bargain store in Monroe, N.C., with $750 in savings, a $500 loan and about $3,000 worth of goods. He called it \u201cNew York Racket\u201d because he thought it made it sound big and would attract shoppers.\n\nThe company expanded to downtown Charleston in 1926, when it opened at 232 King St., the current site of Belmond Charleston Place.\n\nBelk now has four department stores throughout the region, including a \u201cflagship\u201d location at Mount Pleasant Towne Centre. The others are at Citadel Mall in Charleston, Northwoods Mall in North Charleston and North Main Market in Summerville.\n\nSenior executives set the wheels in motion for a sale of the family business in August 2014, when they began to plot out a three-year operating plan while keeping in mind the mounting competitive pressures from larger and specialty retailers. During those discussions, they began informally exploring a \u201cbroad range of potential strategic alternatives\u201d to \u201cmaximize shareholder value,\u201d according to a summary of the events that led to the sale.\n\nThey later hired investment bank Goldman Sachs to help it evaluate those alternatives.\n\nSycamore, a New York-based private equity firm, emerged as the buyer. Its previous retail industry investments have included stakes mostly in specialty merchants, such as Aeropostale, Nine West, Jones New York and Talbots, among others. Belk is Sycamore\u2019s first department store purchase \u2014 and its biggest deal ever.\n\nBelk has said it does not anticipate any layoffs or store closings as a result of the sale and the company will keep its Charlotte headquarters.\n\n\u201cOur partnership with Sycamore will contribute to Belk\u2019s continued success, and we look forward to leveraging Sycamore\u2019s deep knowledge of the retail market to best serve our dedicated customers and provide even greater opportunities for our valued team members,\u201d said third-generation CEO Tim Belk, who remains in the top job.\n\nStefan Kaluzny, managing director of Sycamore, said his firm was excited \u201cto begin our partnership\u201d with the retailer.\n\n\u201cThe company has developed a loyal base of customers over its 127-year history, and we believe Belk is positioned for continued growth and success,\u201d he said in a written statement that invoked the tag line created by the retailer\u2019s previous owner. \u201cWe look forward to working with Belk\u2019s management team and associates as they build on the company\u2019s legacy and continue to serve its customers and deliver \u2018Modern.
