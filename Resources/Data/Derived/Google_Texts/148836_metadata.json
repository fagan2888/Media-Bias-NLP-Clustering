Carter: W.H. fixes mental health gap\n\nFormer first lady Rosalynn Carter found herself shaking with excitement when she recently heard from Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius that the administration had issued a milestone mental health insurance rule, correcting \u201cone of the greatest disappointments\u201d of her life.\n\nIn an interview for the latest installment of CSPAN\u2019s First Ladies series \u2014 for which Carter is the first living First Lady interviewed \u2014 Carter reflected on her efforts in the last days of the Carter administration to pass a mental health parity law that would expand access to mental health services across the United States.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cWe toured the country, found out what was needed, developed legislation and passed the Mental Health Systems Act of 1980. It passed through Congress one month before Jimmy, as he says was, \u2018involuntarily retired\u2019 from the White House,\u201d Carter said. \u201c[A]nd the incoming president put it on the shelf. Never implemented it. It was one of the greatest disappointments of my life.\u201d\n\nMental health parity refers to the requirement that health insurance companies treat mental health and substance abuse benefits no differently than physical health services. When the administration last month issued a final rule on the implementation of the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008 \u2014 an expansion of similar legislation passed in 1996 \u2014 the former first lady\u2019s efforts were finally realized.\n\n\u201cAs soon as I heard it, I started shaking, you know? I mean, this is 33 years after I called; I had wanted it, so it was exciting. It was emotional,\u201d Carter said. \u201cOne of the people who worked with me in the White House \u2026 did a comparison of what we did in 1980 with the Affordable Care Act. It is almost identical,\u201d\n\nThe former first lady also expressed her dismay at the lack of press coverage for mental health issues.\n\n\u201cI got upset with the press too because they covered my mental health work my first few meetings I had, and then they never showed up anymore,\u201d she said \u201c[A]nd one of the things I wanted to do is bring attention to the issue and how terrible it was and what few services there were.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd so one day I was walking in the downstairs floor in the White House and met this woman who was one of the press people and I said, \u2018You don\u2019t ever cover my \u2014 nobody ever covers my meetings\u2019 and she said, \u2018Mrs. Carter, mental health is just not a sexy issue,\u2019\u201d she recounted.\n\nNonetheless, Carter hopes that her legacy expands beyond her role as the first lady to include her and her husbands work for The Carter Center.\n\n\u201cI hope I have contributed something to mental health issues, and improved, a little bit, the lives of people living with mental health illnesses,\u201d she said.\n\nCarter is the first living first lady featured in the series, which is now in its second season. The program, with Carter\u2019s full interview, will air Monday, Dec. 9 at 9 p.m. ET.\n\nAuthors:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "She says the health insurance rule corrects \u201cone of the greatest disappointments\u201d of her life.", "title": "Carter: W.H. fixes mental health gap", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2013/12/rosalynn-carter-mental-health-insurance-100798.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2013/12/06/131206_sebelius_carter_ap_328.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Health Care (1864),Rosalynn Carter (3),Mental Health (48)", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "She says the health insurance rule corrects \u201cone of the greatest disappointments\u201d of her life.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd6a0f\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI hope I have contributed something to mental health issues, and improved, a little bit, the lives of people living with mental health illnesses,\u201d she said.\nIt was one of the greatest disappointments of my life.\u201dMental health parity refers to the requirement that health insurance companies treat mental health and substance abuse benefits no differently than physical health services.\nCarter, mental health is just not a sexy issue,\u2019\u201d she recounted.\nfixes mental health gapFormer first lady Rosalynn Carter found herself shaking with excitement when she recently heard from Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius that the administration had issued a milestone mental health insurance rule, correcting \u201cone of the greatest disappointments\u201d of her life.\n'I hope I have contributed something to mental health issues,' Carter says."}
