(AP) - Researchers in Rhode Island may be one step closer to figuring out how a mysterious disease known as white-nose syndrome is killing off bats across North America.\n\nA team of scientists led by Brown University professor Richard Bennett was awarded more than $500,000 from the National Science Foundation to figure out how to combat the disease, named for the white fungus that appears on the noses and wings of bats.\n\nFirst detected in New York State in 2006, it has killed an estimated 5 million to 6 million bats in 28 states and Canada. Scientists believe the disease spread from Europe, where bats are more resilient to it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that this is perhaps the biggest decline in wildlife from an infectious agent in the past century,\u201d Bennett said.\n\nThe syndrome is caused by a cold-loving fungus, pseudogymnoascus destructans, or Pd, which penetrates tissues of the nose, mouth and wings, compromising a bat\u2019s ability to stay hydrated and maintain body temperature.\n\nBennett\u2019s lab, which typically studies human fungal infections, is focusing on the substance the fungus secretes. The team has partnered with a pair of University of California researchers.\n\n\u201cA lot of these pathogenic fungi, that\u2019s how they cause disease, they secrete,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at those potential factors that could allow it to cause disease in a bat. It\u2019s a relatively new direction for us.\u201d\n\nBennett\u2019s team has been sending samples to Giselle Knudsen, an adjunct professor at the University of California, San Francisco, who identifies the proteins secreted by the fungi.\n\nThe team believes the secretion could be degrading the bats\u2019 tissue and also helping the fungus penetrate into the tissue.\n\nBennett and his colleagues published a paper in April on their findings. Ultimately, the team hopes to treat the infected bats.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t envision giving drugs to bats, but there may be a clever way to do something,\u201d Knudsen said. \u201cIt\u2019s such a dire prediction, we have to do something. Even if it\u2019s awkward and silly, I think someone clever will think of a way to perhaps spray a bat cave with some sort of antifungal agent.\u201d\n\nThe next step for Bennett\u2019s lab will be getting bat tissue samples to see how the secretion might change on a bat.\n\nFor now, there are no bats in the lab - just the fungi, which the researchers are growing in a converted wine cooler to save money, Bennett said.\n\nThe National Science Foundation currently funds 6 research projects on white-nose syndrome totaling nearly $3 million. NSF, a federal agency, funds projects that address basic biological questions and have broader impacts of interest to society, such as white-nose syndrome, the foundation said.\n\nSam Scheiner, program director of environmental biology at NSF, said researching white-nose syndrome is important because the disease has led to the disappearance of many bats, which play a major role in the ecosystem as a predator of insects. It\u2019s also important, he said, in helping researchers understand how diseases spread.\n\n\u201cWhite-nose syndrome is not the first, nor will it be the last, disease that\u2019s going to come to North America,\u201d Scheiner said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Researchers in Rhode Island may be one step closer to figuring out how a mysterious disease known as white-nose syndrome is killing off bats across North America.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Researchers in Rhode Island may be one step closer to figuring out how a mysterious disease known as white-nose syndrome is killing off bats across North America.", "title": "Scientists at Brown University studying fungus killing bats", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jul/12/scientists-at-brown-university-studying-fungus-kil/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/07/12/23564dd512a5ff1f7b0f6a7067008018.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/07/12/23564dd512a5ff1f7b0f6a7067008018.jpg", "description": "Researchers in Rhode Island may be one step closer to figuring out how a mysterious disease known as white-nose syndrome is killing off bats across North America.", "card": "summary", "title": "Scientists at Brown University studying fungus killing bats"}, "Author": "AMY ANTHONY", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "First detected in New York State in 2006, it has killed an estimated 5 million to 6 million bats in 28 states and Canada.\n\u201cWhite-nose syndrome is not the first, nor will it be the last, disease that\u2019s going to come to North America,\u201d Scheiner said.\nNSF, a federal agency, funds projects that address basic biological questions and have broader impacts of interest to society, such as white-nose syndrome, the foundation said.\nThe team believes the secretion could be degrading the bats\u2019 tissue and also helping the fungus penetrate into the tissue.\nThe National Science Foundation currently funds 6 research projects on white-nose syndrome totaling nearly $3 million."}
