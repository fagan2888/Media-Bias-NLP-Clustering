Four years later he graduated from Troy University-Dothan with a bachelor\u2019s degree in elementary education.\n\nAs the program coordinator at Boys and Girls Clubs of Hawk-Houston, Danzey helps the kids and tracks their progress.\n\n\u201cIf they\u2019re doing good, that lets you know what you\u2019re doing here is working,\u201d Danzey said.\n\nDanzey has a job he finds important and fulfilling, but for many Americans working longer isn\u2019t just an option. It\u2019s a necessity.\n\nA nationwide Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research survey of 1,024 adults ages 50 and over conducted in August and September shows a shift in attitudes about work, aging and retirement.\n\nBy 2020 about 25 percent of the U.S. workforce will be composed of workers ages 55 and over, up from 19 percent in 2010. It is a segment of the population that is not only growing rapidly in numbers but is also substantially healthier than previous generations.\n\n\u201cRetirement is not only coming later in life, it no longer represents a complete exit from the workforce,\u201d said Trevor Tompson, director of the AP-NORC Center. \u201cThe data in this survey reveal s strikingly different views of retirement among older workers today than those held by the prior generation.\u201d\n\nEconomic realities\n\nRobert Crowder, executive director of the Southern Alabama Regional Council on Aging, said the realities of today\u2019s economics make working longer mandatory in a lot of cases.\n\n\u201cOne of the biggest factors is people are living longer,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fastest growing segment of our senior population is those people that are over 85.\u201d\n\nHaving enough income to survive those later years is the problem. Uncertainty about health and living costs and what government programs will provide have people questioning how much they need to have saved.\n\nFor people making minimum wage or working in nominal jobs, Crowder said it\u2019s hard to save much of anything.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re working their lives, living day to day,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen unexpected things happen that increase their expenses or cut their income, they often aren\u2019t prepared.\n\nThe need for health insurance grows more important as they get older, when the possibility of a heart attack, stroke, catastrophic illness or injury increases.\n\n\u201cPeople are living longer, so naturally the probability of them having one of those things happen to them is a whole lot greater,\u201d Crowder said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of when.\u201d\n\nThe types of jobs have changed. Crowder said his grandparents were farmers in what was then a farming community.\n\n\u201cWhen I was a kid there was corn and cotton grown inside the (Ross Clark) Circle, a lot of it,\u201d he said.\n\nWhat used to be agrarian has become more urban. Retail and office workers make up a bigger portion of the workforce.\n\nFactories that become more automated require fewer employees. Many locally-owned businesses have been replaced by regional, national and international companies. Furloughs and layoffs are more commonplace, and people who spend years working in one industry have seen their jobs disappear.\n\nCrowder said family dynamics have changed. People used to have more kids, and they usually didn\u2019t move far from where their parents lived.\n\n\u201cWhen people got older, they had a natural support system,\u201d he said.\n\nNow, family members are fewer and more scattered. Even worse, many older Americans are taking on extra burdens. In some cases, grandparents who were just getting by in life find themselves taking on the role of caretaker.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got a tremendous number of people across this country who are elderly that are raising their grandkids,\u201d Crowder said. \u201cThey\u2019re the sole provider for them.\u201d\n\nNo straight path\n\nPlanning for life\u2019s challenges rarely follows a straight path. Economic downturns happen, lives change, and the chain of events people hoped would carry them into a comfortable retirement doesn\u2019t always play out.\n\n\u201cWhat people had anticipated, what people had worked toward suddenly changed, and that has caused all sorts of ripples in our business,\u201d said Dr. Bill Sellers, associate dean of career and technical education at Wallace Community College.\n\nThe college works to cater its curriculum to the local job market.\n\n\u201cAs we discover needs in the community, we build programs based on those needs,\u201d said Vincent Vincent, the coordinator of noncredit training at WCC. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing lots of people 50-plus wanting to come back to school, either out of necessity or out of just wanting to contribute to society still.\u201d\n\nPhillip Kitchens, a student in the associate degree nursing program at WCC, is one of them.\n\n\u201cWhen I was in high school, I worked in a nursing home as an orderly,\u201d Kitchens said. \u201cI really enjoyed my job, and that was what I wanted to do.\u201d\n\nHe thought he\u2019d have the opportunity to go into some type of medical field when he went into the military, \u201cbut the Air Force had different plans for me, and they put me in law enforcement.\u201d\n\nOnce he got into law enforcement, he liked it. He was a deputy sheriff in Houston County for a while, then worked 15 years for Movie Gallery until its corporate office moved to Oregon.\n\nHe and his wife opened Cold Stone Creamery, near Carmike Cinemas. Owning a business means you have to come up with your own insurance plan.\n\n\u201cMy premiums have doubled,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like you\u2019re at the point (where) I don\u2019t know if I can afford to pay for insurance like that.\u201d\n\nWhen he saw an opportunity to pursue a nursing degree, he took it. He\u2019s looking for a career that will provide benefits and carry him into his late 60s, maybe even his 70s.\n\n\u201cWhen I first started school, it was a little intimidating because I was thinking I\u2019m going to be in there with all of these kids and I\u2019m going to be the oldest guy in the room, and that wasn\u2019t the case,\u201d he said.\n\nChanging attitudes\n\nAttitudes about work and retirement have changed in the last few years. Administrators at WCC have noticed the signs.\n\nSellers said some workers who planned to retire at a certain age are concerned about leaving when they\u2019re on solid ground with a good job. \u201cThey are spending many more years in the workforce than they thought they would initially,\u201d he said.\n\nVincent said a couple of months after some people retire they realize \u201cthey\u2019re bored out of their mind and want to go back.\u201d\n\nMichael Mulgrew has been district manager at Kelly Services in Dothan for only a few weeks, but has already noticed a lot of teachers coming out of retirement to pick up extra work as substitute teachers.\n\nThe Dothan City School Board voted in February to outsource its substitute teaching jobs to Kelly Services. The move freed the school system from having to provide health insurance to some who may be entitled to it under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare.\n\n\u201cMost of the ones that come in here, they\u2019re looking for the most part for a little extra money, and some of them it\u2019s just the enjoyment of what they used to do,\u201d Mulgrew said.\n\nAt the prior company he worked with in the Atlanta area, Mulgrew saw nurses coming out of retirement to fill jobs.\n\nThe Plus 50 Career Fair Series, held at WCC in four sessions during October, offered people 50 and older the chance to learn more about training for a new career.\n\nWhen businesses close or have layoffs the workers are displaced, often when they are too young or unprepared for retirement. Some decide to start a new career in a field that holds more potential for longevity and higher pay.\n\nSellers said businesses and industries were coming to WCC a few years back for help in training people to fill jobs. The companies were expecting an exodus of older workers, but it didn\u2019t happen because the employees decided to hold on to their jobs a bit longer.\n\nIt\u2019s a trend that\u2019s likely to continue.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Dothan Eagle", "description": "Norris Danzey served 30 years in the Navy before he retired as a lieutenant commander in 2001, but he wasn\u2019t ready to quit working.", "title": "Older Americans' attitudes on work and retirement changing", "url": "http://www.dothaneagle.com/news/older-americans-attitudes-on-work-and-retirement-changing/article_04b983d2-4418-11e3-bb65-001a4bcf6878.html", "image": {"width": 598, "identifier": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/dothaneagle.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/7/4e/74e209e6-41a1-11e3-a20c-001a4bcf6878/52716b6d5ce19.preview-598.jpg", "height": 397}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@dothaneagle", "card": "summary", "creator": "@"}, "description": "Norris Danzey served 30 years in the Navy before he retired as a lieutenant commander in 2001, but he wasn\u2019t ready to quit working.", "fb": {"app_id": 127957210797}, "keywords": "news,editors_pick,spotlight", "google-site-verification": "FxOwTsXWtkxruLdkniwmNFEqAZKSYYIapDcokfzL5E4", "news_keywords": "news,editors_pick,spotlight"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd00f1\"", "article_summary": "Danzey has a job he finds important and fulfilling, but for many Americans working longer isn\u2019t just an option.\nFor people making minimum wage or working in nominal jobs, Crowder said it\u2019s hard to save much of anything.\n\u201cThey\u2019re working their lives, living day to day,\u201d he said.\nThe companies were expecting an exodus of older workers, but it didn\u2019t happen because the employees decided to hold on to their jobs a bit longer.\nAt the prior company he worked with in the Atlanta area, Mulgrew saw nurses coming out of retirement to fill jobs."}
