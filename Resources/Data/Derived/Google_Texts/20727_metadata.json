They look to the teacher for help when they get stuck.\n\nThe scene looks a whole lot like a high school classroom.\n\nBut the students here aren\u2019t taking world lit. They\u2019re adults learning how to advocate for kids through the Guardian Ad Litem Program.\n\nSo it\u2019s kind of appropriate, this flashback to childhood - Ad litems are supposed to be the voice of kids when there are questions about abuse or neglect.\n\nThese bankers, real estate agents, teachers make recommendations to a judge about whether or not a kid should stay with his or her biological parents or be put in some other living situation.\n\nVolunteers have to go through 30 hours of training. They learn about the legal process, what kinds of services are available for families, and tips on how to be culturally sensitive.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all very much aware that its not going to be just \u201coh we\u2019re just going to hang out and going to mentor these kids,\u201d said Ingrid Gonzalez, a newly minted volunteer.\n\n\u201cThat's not what the program is. So were coming into it with an understanding that this could be very difficult but I think we all have the heart to say you know what its work worth doing.\u201d\n\nProtecting the state\u2019s kids has been a political hot topic for months, in reaction to a recent Miami Herald investigation into hundreds of child deaths. This Spring, state legislators passed a bill to beef up the ad litem program, adding lawyers to the people standing up for kids in cases of abuse in neglect.\n\nThat bill right now sits on Gov. Rick Scott\u2019s desk. Until then, volunteers remain a main voice for children.\n\nAnd in order for them to form a recommendation -- each ad litem volunteer works with the case manager and a staff lawyer to sort through all the files and interviews.\n\nPatricia Abaroa is the volunteer coordinator for the guardian ad litem program in Miami-Dade County. She says, while caseworkers may have 40 different families to juggle at once - ad litems have one case at a time.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re one person and you may have a case with 2 kids but you just have, you commit your time solely to those 2 kids and they just end up they have your full attention pretty much,\u201d she said.\n\nFor this crop of volunteers, this was their final class. They ended the training feeling like they had the support and the resources to do a good job.\n\nBut their lack of professional training has people like Howard Talenfeld concerned. Talenfield is president of an advocacy organization called Florida\u2019s Children First.\n\n\u201cThe ideal model is that there be a guardian and lawyer in every case,\u201d he said.\n\nThe bill that passed in Tallahassee would mean lawyers would also be assigned to some kids. According to the ad-litem program, if the law passes, it will provide lawyers to about 10 percent of those in the system.\n\nBut one guardian, one lawyer, one case is a goal Talenfeld aims to reach. That's not the way it is now, he said.\n\n\u201cThose lawyers may have 100 cases they really can\u2019t do the job of a specially and uniquely representing individual children because they don't meet with these children outside of the courtroom,\u201d Talenfeld said.\n\nA lawyer can wade through benefits like Medicaid in ways that Ad litems simply aren\u2019t trained to do. Or fight against being forced to take certain types of medication, especially for mental illness -- in cases where they might not need it, Talenfeld said.\n\n\u201cIt sometimes takes extraordinary efforts to figure out a child\u2019s rights in school, a child\u2019s rights through the dependency process it\u2019s the life of a child that\u2019s at stake,\u201d he said.\n\n***\n\nAlthough the Guardian ad litem program is held up as an example of what works in child advocacy, it is in a time of transition. Here are some basics.\n\nWhat's the program all about?\n\nDepending on their circumstances, most kids referred to the Department of Children and Families are appointed a guardian ad litem. They're not part of DCF, but ad litems advocate for the best interests of a child in dependency courts.\n\nProceedings in this court determine where a child will live. Children may be put in foster care, up for adoption or placed with another family member. The court can also decide to place the child back with a parent if she or he goes through any number of treatment, training, or therapy sessions.\n\nPart of what determines the outcome of that proceeding is the ad litem\u2019s recommendation. Because of this semi-legal status, they can talk to teachers, doctors, therapists, family members, case workers or anyone else who may have an impact on the child\u2019s well-being.\n\nEven though they\u2019re only required to visit with the kid once a month \u2014 which isn\u2019t a lot considering the gravity of their assignment \u2014 many ad litems visit more.\n\nAn ad litem volunteer works with the case manager and a staff lawyer to sort through all the files and interviews, but those case managers and lawyers have dozens of cases. Ad Litems have one case at a time.\n\nBut they don\u2019t necessarily have any professional training. Though some happen to be lawyers during the day, often these are these are teachers, realtors, and homemakers.\n\nHow do volunteers become guardians ad litem?\n\n1. Hopeful volunteers fill out a short application showing interest and submit written character references.\n\n2. A staff person interviews each applicant to make sure he or she is suitable for the program.\n\n3. Volunteers complete 30 hours of class training, which includes lectures, group work and court observation. The training teaches volunteers about the legal process, what kinds of services are available for kids and parents, and tips on how to be culturally sensitive.\n\nA new pilot program, though, is changing the focus of the training to incorporate more hands-on experience. The new training includes self-directed online tutorials, class lectures, and partnering with an experienced guardian ad litem on a case.\n\nThis change comes in part due to feedback from guardian ad litems who felt nervous about taking on their first case without any real-world experience under their belts.", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "In a doublewide trailer, eight people sit at desks clustered into two groups, talking and arguing with each other.
