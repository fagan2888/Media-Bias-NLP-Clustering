DeFrancesco Soto:\n\nWe discussed any number of subjects, including how novel the Netflix model of releasing all of the episodes of a season at once actually is. But I wanted to linger a little bit longer on one part of our conversation.\n\nOne thing that frustrates me about House of Cards, and about Beau Willimon\u2019s work more generally, is how dismissive he is of ideology and interests. Frank Underwood (Kevin Spacey) has no discernible reasons for being a Democrat, no particular view about how the world best functions, or what is fair and just. We have no sense of what the national mood and national needs are, which makes it even more puzzling how President Walker ascended to the highest office of the land, given his utter lack of savvy and Frank-like skills of manipulation. There are no constituencies who need to be appeased, or pandered to, or courted come election year in House Of Cards. Congresswoman Jackie Sharp (Molly Parker) may trot out lists of people who would be affected by a government shutdown, but they\u2019re never more substantial than those boxed-up reams of paper. Once the teacher\u2019s union plot dissipated in the first season, there aren\u2019t even really interest groups: we\u2019ve been left mostly with the lingering, Koch-esque shade of Raymond Tusk.\n\nThis total disinterest in ideology and the dynamic ecology of politics has, for me, always undermined House Of Cards\u2018 claims to be an authentic or realistic. There are people in Washington who behave with ruthless attention to their own careers, but it doesn\u2019t always keep them on a steady ascent to the Oval Office\u2013witness, for example, the way Senate Republicans recently shook off Sen. Ted Cruz\u2019s efforts to turn the latest fight over the debt ceiling into a chance to burnish his own image. Even our fair city\u2019s real-life Machiavellians recognize the value of ideology as a tool to help them gain power, even if they\u2019re personally unmoved by the worldview they\u2019re espousing. Cruz\u2019s stunt was, after all, entirely about burnishing his conservative bona fides.\n\nAnd the truth is that not everyone in Washington wants to be President of the United States, and their commitment to ideology over their own advancement can be the key to their victory in policy fights. My own recently-departed boss Tom Perriello, who\u2019s left the Center for American Progress for the State Department, may have lost his Virginia Congressional seat over his vote for the Affordable Care Act, but that doesn\u2019t make him a loser. The point, after all, was to pass health care reform, not to stay in Congress forever. But that\u2019s an order of priorities House Of Cards can\u2019t really seem to comprehend. And I think it makes the show weaker.\n\nAs I said on Up, House Of Cards\u2018 total disinterest in ideology means that there\u2019s an inevitable, gaping hole in the show\u2019s portrayal of Frank Underwood. We have no idea why he wants to be President, other than that the job is there for the taking, and we have no real sense of what he\u2019ll do with the position when he\u2019s there. That emptiness makes it much more difficult to either root for Frank or to view his ascension with any sort of dread. He\u2019s just another little man who\u2019s convinced that he\u2019s somehow different from his peers, an idea that House Of Cards is invested in, at cost to its actual sophistication. To a certain extent, Frank\u2019s emptiness is interesting. The idea that he\u2019s had to kill off the parts of himself that were specific and human in service of his rise has elements of tragedy, and the episode of the show set at his college reunion, which explored those ideas, remains the show\u2019s best. But the second season of House Of Cards largely abandons the sense that Frank has made some sort of ascetic commitment to his own rise. Instead, he can get away with everything because, as we\u2019re constantly told, he\u2019s just so darn smart.\n\nAnd therein lies the show\u2019s second problem: there\u2019s no worldview that\u2019s a credible alternative to Frank\u2019s, and no genuinely exciting antagonist for him. In Raymond Tusk, Frank\u2019s essentially faced another version of himself, a powerful man invested in no particular interests except his own, attempting to manipulate politics from outside the system, rather than with deep familiarity of its cogs and levers. In this battle, House Of Cards suggests that it\u2019s better to be inside than out, but not for any particular reason. The one actually ideological Congressman we see is presented as a bit of a loser and a dupe, a man who\u2019s rolled over for Frank before, and when he gets his blood up to impeach President Walker, doesn\u2019t realize that he\u2019s playing right into Frank\u2019s hands. It would have been fascinating to see Frank square off against a capable opponent employing a genuinely different set of tools than he did, capable of marshaling public opinion, keenly attuned to an actual election cycle, hot-blooded where Frank is not just frozen, but desiccated. Such a juxtaposition might have forced Willimon and House Of Cards to make an actual argument for Frank Underwood\u2019s worldview, rather than just insisting on his genius. The inevitability of Frank\u2019s victories, as much as the show\u2019s constant musical and visual monotony, makes House of Cards fantastically dull.\n\nIf House Of Cards was willing to put Frank at actual risk, the show might have had something real and true to say about politics. Instead, the show is peddling a smug contempt for Washington as if it\u2019s something new, rather than a ancient canard. Frank Underwood may abhor ideology.
