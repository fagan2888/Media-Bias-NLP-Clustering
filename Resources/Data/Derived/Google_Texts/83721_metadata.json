Back in September we reported rats were invading the neighborhood.\n\nThese rats are making their homes in current and future developments, and it\u2019s getting bad.\n\nNow, some people are starting to fight back. However, in at least one case, whomever is combating the rats hasn\u2019t figured out what the term \u201cunintended consequences\u201d means.\n\nAccording to local blog Seattle Dog Spot, someone scattered rat poison around sidewalks and in shrubs, presumably to kill the rats. But dogs are eating the poison, too.\n\nAccording to the owner of one dog who ate the rat pellets, they saw about 50 bags of rat poison \u201cin the planters outside\u201d two businesses.\n\nAnd this isn\u2019t a type of rat poison that is safe for animals. According to photos of the rat poison bags, it\u2019s a brand called Ramik Green, which has a label that says \u201cHAZARD TO HUMANS AND DOMESTIC ANIMALS CAUTION: Keep away from humans, domestic animals and pets.\u201d\n\nApparently the poison causes internal bleeding where the animal who ingests to poison will die in three to five days. The dog, in this case, was quickly treated by an emergency veterinarian and is expected to live.\n\nI understand the need to kill the rats in the neighborhood, but maybe next time use a little common sense?", "article_metadata": {"description": "Some people are starting to fight back against the South Lake Union rat infestation.
