It was not immediately clear how the man died, although he was shot at least once in the wrist. U.N. troops were not present at Saturday\u2019s protest. The demonstrations also spread to other towns, including Gonaives and Cap-Haitien.\n\nThe unrest followed a demonstration Friday in which U.N. peacekeeping troops opened fire on a crowd that marched through Port-au-Prince, set tires on fire and skirmished with troops and police.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Haiti awaits PM speech amid political discontent", "title": "Haiti awaits PM speech amid political discontent", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Haiti awaits PM speech amid political discontent", "title": "Haiti awaits PM speech amid political discontent", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/12/14/haiti_awaits_pm_speech_amid_political_discontent/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/aptopix-haiti-protests.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Haiti awaits PM speech amid political discontent", "title": "Haiti awaits PM speech amid political discontent", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/aptopix-haiti-protests.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Evens Sanon", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca228\"", "article_summary": "It was not immediately clear how the man died, although he was shot at least once in the wrist.\nOn Saturday, one man died in a protest in Port-Au-Prince during clashes with police who were firing tear gas.\nHaiti\u2019s capital has endured a growing number of violent demonstrations in which protesters are demanding long-delayed elections and the resignations of Lamothe as well as Martelly.\nGovernment officials said late Saturday that Lamothe would be delivering his speech within minutes, but more than two hours passed with no announcement.\nThe unrest followed a demonstration Friday in which U.N. peacekeeping troops opened fire on a crowd that marched through Port-au-Prince, set tires on fire and skirmished with troops and police."}
