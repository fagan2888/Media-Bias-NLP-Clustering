The author of “Why We Work,” Professor Barry Schwartz, discusses how money and titles are nice, but what makes a job meaningful can be equally important.

More than half of all American workers are the unhappiest they've been at work in two decades. In fact, only 45 percent describe themselves as satisfied with their jobs, according to the non-profit research group, The Conference Board.

Back in 1987, 61 percent of Americans surveyed were happy at their work when the group began their annual survey. So why do so many hate their jobs so much?

"Because nobody has tried to make jobs worth liking." Swarthmore College professor Barry Schwartz told CNBC in an interview with "On The Money".

In his new book, "Why We Work", Schwartz looks for answers why some find fulfillment in their occupation, while others find frustration in their daily grind.

Schwartz said that "people do care about what they do," but he says the assumption that has guided private sector development is "that the only reason anybody works is to get paid. And as long as you're getting paid, it doesn't matter what you do."

The psychologist said that wasn't true 200 years ago and it's not true now. However, he says now, it "seems impossible to penetrate the skulls of people who organize workplaces" to change that view.
