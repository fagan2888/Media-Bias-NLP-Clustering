He works with indigenous communities in central Mexico to preserve their languages and culture. He designed an educator endorsement program for teacher competencies used in teacher preparation programs in Guanajuato, according to a release.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s also trying to establish collaborations to get masters students as well as bachelor-level students here to Georgia, and vice versa,\u201d Carrera-Carrillo said.\n\nCarrera-Carrillo and Martinez-Cortes visited World Language Academy in Hall County, where they observed several dual-immersion classes.\n\n\u201cWe are very impressed with those classrooms,\u201d she said.\n\nThey also visited West Hall High School to sit in on some International Baccalaureate classes. Carrera-Carrillo\u2019s school in Mexico is an IB school.\n\nThey then met with representatives from Brenau University, Piedmont College, the University of Georgia and the University of North Georgia to discuss further collaborations between Georgia universities and the Universidad Pedag\u00f3gica Nacional.\n\n\u201cIt would enrich their experience for teaching, because they would learn about different ways to work in the teaching profession,\u201d Martinez-Cortes said in Spanish. \u201cAnd I believe we could open some research lines about education.\u201d\n\nMartinez-Cortes said he is interested in having local teachers visit Mexico to experience the culture and language immersively, and to improve instructional practices in both places.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve started the first steps toward making this a reality,\u201d Carrera-Carrillo said. \u201cWe see a strong potential for this to really happen.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.gainesvilletimes.com/archives/111460/", "image": "http://media.morristechnology.com/webmedia/upload/gainesville/article/2015/08/14/0815exchange4.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Students in Hall County Schools and students at a private school in Guanajuato, Mexico, may not have much in common.", "title": "Dual immersion program lets students work on projects together online"}, "twitter": {"site": "@gtimes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "title": "Dual immersion program lets students work on projects together online"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd6cce\"", "article_summary": "Students in Hall County Schools and students at a private school in Guanajuato, Mexico, may not have much in common.\nThe program could allow teachers from each region to learn new techniques through the exchange, and it could allow students at World Language Academy in Hall County to work on some projects online with students across the border.\nCarrera-Carrillo and Martinez-Cortes visited World Language Academy in Hall County, where they observed several dual-immersion classes.\n\u201cHe\u2019s also trying to establish collaborations to get masters students as well as bachelor-level students here to Georgia, and vice versa,\u201d Carrera-Carrillo said.\nRepresentatives from the Academia Internacional of San Miguel de Allende, a private dual immersion school for students from pre-K through 12th grade in central Mexico, and from the Universidad Pedag\u00f3gica Nacional in Guanajuato, Mexico, visited Hall County this week to discuss a possible teacher-exchange program."}
