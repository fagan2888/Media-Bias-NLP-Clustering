This was nearly the final step that would allow Latin America's No. 3 economy an unencumbered return to international capital markets.\n\nThe injunctions were removed by Griesa on March 2. The issue will be heard before the U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals on April 13.\n\nPollack said that as part of the agreement announced on Wednesday, the funds express their support for and withdraw their opposition in the Court of Appeals to the lifting of the injunction.\n\n\"If the Order is affirmed, this settlement will become final and binding on the parties,\" Pollack said.\n\nThe country has until noon New York City time on April 14 to pay $4.65 billion to the main hedge funds that fought for and won an advantageous settlement after balking at the terms offered in two prior settlements.\n\nArgentina plans to pay off the creditors in cash after issuing up to $12.5 billion in new bonds. About $3 billion more is needed to pay smaller funds that joined the suit over the years.\n\n(Reporting by Daniel Bases; Editing by Leslie Adler and Andrew Hay)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Argentina settled with additional creditors holding defaulted sov", "title": "Argentina, creditors agree $250 million more in default settlement: mediator", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/06/Argentina-creditors-agree-250-million-more-default-settlement-mediator", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/argentina-debt_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/06/Argentina-creditors-agree-250-million-more-default-settlement-mediator", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/argentina-debt_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Argentina settled with additional creditors holding defaulted sov", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Argentina settled with additional creditors holding defaulted sovereign bonds for just under $250 million, Daniel Pollack, the court-appointed mediator in the long-running case, said in a statement on Wednesday.\nArgentina plans to pay off the creditors in cash after issuing up to $12.5 billion in new bonds.\n\"Thus, the funds will be paid 150 percent of the principal of their bonds,\" Pollack said, noting the settlement was within the terms outlined by Argentina on Feb. 5.\nAbout $3 billion more is needed to pay smaller funds that joined the suit over the years.\n3 economy closer to ending a 14-year legal battle over its historic default that blocked it from global credit markets."}
