Rush Holt (D-12th Dist.) in Congress.\n\nSen. Linda Greenstein (D-Middlesex) scored the expected endorsement of the Middlesex County Democratic Organization just one day after Assemblywoman Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-Mercer) was endorsed by the Mercer County Democratic Committee.\n\n\u201cSimply put, there is no stronger advocate for the progressive values that we as Democrats embrace than Sen. Greenstein,\u201d Middlesex Democratic chairman Kevin McCabe said in a news release. \u201cWhether it is fighting for paid family leave, protecting seniors from predatory scams or standing up for organized labor, Sen. Greenstein embodies the best that public service has to offer.\u201d\n\nAssemblyman Upendra Chivukula (D-Somerset) is also running for the seat but the Somerset County Democratic Committee has yet to endorse a candidate.\n\nHolt, 65, announced he would not seek re-election to a ninth term in Congress earlier this week.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s some strong candidates, and I knew there would be,\u201d Holt said this morning, noting the field of potential candidates made it easier to decide against seeking a ninth term. \u201cThat did factor into my thinking.\u201d\n\nThe first labor endorsements of the primary season were also recorded yesterday, with Coleman announcing the support of the 20,000-member New Jersey Laborers Union, which is the statewide affiliate of the Laborers\u2019 International Union of North America.\n\nIn a news release, the union cited Coleman\u2019s sponsorship of the Economic Opportunity Act of 2013 as a factor in its endorsement.\n\n\u201cThere is no learning process for Assemblywoman Watson Coleman,\u201d Laborers\u2019 national vice president Raymond Pocino said in a statement. \u201cShe understands the district, she understands the issues facing both residents and businesses and she understands what it will take to change things in Congress. She has unparalleled experience and an unmatched dedication to the people of the 12th Congressional District.\u201d\n\nJust hours later, Greenstein announced her own labor endorsement from the Mercer County Labor Council, which represents 50,000 workers in the greater Mercer County region.\n\n\u201c(Greenstein) has stood with us time after time after time,\u201d Labor Council president Michael Maloney said. \u201cShe is a true friend of the labor movement, and has fought with us against the right wing\u2019s attacks on working families. Linda understands that our families need good jobs, affordable health care, and safe communities. These are the hallmarks of her time in the Legislature, and we desperately need those values in the halls of Congress.\u201d\n\nGreenstein also announced the endorsement of her 14th District Colleagues, Assemblymen Wayne DeAngelo and Dan Benson (both D-Mercer) who have said they would seek Greenstein\u2019s Senate seat if she were to win election to the 12th Congressional District.\n\n\u201cThere is no tougher and more tested fighter in Trenton than Linda Greenstein, period,\u201d DeAngelo said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThe ideals that Congressman Holt has championed are the ideals that Linda champions, from a higher minimum wage to access to affordable health care to protecting our seniors and children,\u201d Benson said.\n\nSen. Shirley Turner and Assemblyman Reed Gusciora (both D-Mercer) threw their support behind Coleman on Thursday after briefly considering their own campaigns.\n\n\u201c(Coleman) is feisty and you definitely know where she stands on the issues and what she believes in,\u201d Gusciora said on Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s something that resonates with the whole district.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe shares our core Democratic values and has demonstrated strong leadership in the Legislature throughout her political career,\u201d Turner said in a statement.\n\nThe Democratic winner of the June 3 primary could face Somerset County resident Alieta Eck, a former Senate candidate and the only announced Republican candidate for Holt\u2019s seat, who received her home county Republican party\u2019s endorsement today.\n\n\u201c(Eck\u2019s) compassion and dedication to our most needy residents shows her heart and her advocacy for freedom in medicine and beyond shows her dedication to the ideals that made our nation strong,\u201d Somerset County Republican chairman Al Gaburo said.\n\nContact Mike Davis at (609) 989-5708 or mdavis@njtimes.com.\n\nOn mobile or desktop:\n\n\u2022 Like Times of Trenton on Facebook\n\n\u2022 Follow @TimesofTrenton on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "'2014-congressional-races','@river','@times','bonnie-watson-coleman','linda-greenstein','upendra-chivukula'", "title": "Bonnie Watson Coleman and Linda Greenstein pick up labor endorsements in race to replace Rush Holt", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Bonnie Watson Coleman and Linda Greenstein pick up labor endorsements in race to replace Rush Holt\", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/mercer/index.ssf/2014/02/bonnie_watson_coleman_and_linda_greenstein_both_pick_up_labor_endorsements_in_race_to_replace_rush_h.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/centraljersey_impact/photo/chivukula-greenstein-watson-coleman-congressional-racejpg-16e3f8cf92ceb454.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"12265006\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-02-22T11:31:17Z\", \"author\": \"Mike Davis | Times of Trenton\", \"tags\": [\"2014-congressional-races\",\"@river\",\"@times\",\"bonnie-watson-coleman\",\"linda-greenstein\",\"upendra-chivukula\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.nj.com/centraljersey_impact/photo/14320870-thumb_square_large.jpg", "creator": "@bymikedavis", "site": "@njdotcom", "card": "summary", "description": "Coleman announced the support of the 20,000-member New Jersey Laborers Union and Greenstein got the nod from Mercer County Labor Council, which represents 50,000 workers."}, "article_date_updated": "Saturday, February 22, 2014,  6:31 AM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.nj.com/centraljersey_impact/photo/chivukula-greenstein-watson-coleman-congressional-racejpg-16e3f8cf92ceb454.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"ttmdavis\", \"author_nickname\": \"Mike Davis | Times of Trenton\", \"author_id\": \"10235481\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Mercer County\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.nj.com/mercer/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "NJ.com", "description": "Coleman announced the support of the 20,000-member New Jersey Laborers Union and Greenstein got the nod from Mercer County Labor Council, which represents 50,000 workers.", "title": "Bonnie Watson Coleman and Linda Greenstein pick up labor endorsements in race to replace Rush Holt", "url": "http://www.nj.com/mercer/index.ssf/2014/02/bonnie_watson_coleman_and_linda_greenstein_both_pick_up_labor_endorsements_in_race_to_replace_rush_h.html", "image": "http://media.nj.com/design/alpha/img/logo_njo.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NJ.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Saturday, February 22, 2014,  6:30 AM", "article_author": "Mike Davis | Times of Trenton", "Description": "Coleman announced the support of the 20,000-member New Jersey Laborers Union and Greenstein got the nod from Mercer County Labor Council, which represents 50,000 workers."}, "article_summary": "\u201cThere is no tougher and more tested fighter in Trenton than Linda Greenstein, period,\u201d DeAngelo said in a statement.\nSen.
