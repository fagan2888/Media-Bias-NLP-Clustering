Hodges decision, has been a polarizing figure in the U.S., and even on the Right. Some GOP presidential candidates, for example, believe she ought to just accept current U.S. law on the issue of gay marriage, thus issuing the licenses, while others believe she\u2014and others like her\u2014shouldn\u2019t be forced to violate their conscience.\n\nNow, after issuing a separate statement clarifying that the pope\u2019s secret meeting with Davis \u201cshould not be considered a form of support of her positions,\u201d it seems even the Vatican doesn\u2019t want to get in the middle of the U.S.\u2019s debate on the issue.\n\nVatican spokesman Federico Lombardi said the pontiff met with several dozen people at the Vatican's embassy that day just before leaving Washington for New York and that those meetings were due to the pope's \"kindness and availability.\" In a statement, he added that the \u201conly real audience granted by the pope\u201d at the embassy that day \u201cwas with one of his former students and his family.\" \"The pope did not enter into the details of the situation of Mrs. Davis and his meeting with her should not be considered a form of support of her position in all of its particular and complex aspects,\" Lombardi said.\n\nDavis\u2019 attorney Mat Staver disagrees with this assessment, however, and told the Associated Press that the Vatican had initiated the meeting with her, during which he reportedly thanked her for her courage and told her to \u2018stay strong.\u2019\n\nThomas Rosica, who assists the Vatican press office with English-language media, said Friday that Vatican staff did not organize the meeting. According to the National Catholic Reporter, Rosica said it might have been an initiative by the Vatican\u2019s ambassador to the U.S., Archbishop Carlo Vigano. Rosica said that Vatican staff were not sure the pope \u201cknew fully each of the people he was meeting\u201d while greeting people at the nunciature. He also said Francis had personally approved Friday\u2019s press statement after a meeting with Lombardi on the issue.\n\nRegardless of whether they\u2019re backtracking on what\u2019s widely been reported as support for Davis\u2019 position, there is no denying that in theory, at least, he does believe in \u2018conscientious objection,\u2019 which he made clear to a reporter on his flight home from his visit to the United States.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Could've fooled me. .05/26/2016 3:21:40AM EST.", "author": "Leah Barkoukis", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Could've fooled me.", "title": "Vatican: Pope's Meeting with Kim Davis Not a 'Form of Support'", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/leahbarkoukis/2015/10/02/vatican-backs-off-support-of-kim-davis-n2060292", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/273/1024e3e1-39b6-4200-8bfe-51709bd21c53.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Could've fooled me.", "title": "Vatican: Pope's Meeting with Kim Davis Not a 'Form of Support'", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/leahbarkoukis/2015/10/02/vatican-backs-off-support-of-kim-davis-n2060292", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/273/1024e3e1-39b6-4200-8bfe-51709bd21c53.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Vatican: Pope's Meeting with Kim Davis Not a 'Form of Support' , Leah Barkoukis, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcaade\"", "article_summary": "He also said Francis had personally approved Friday\u2019s press statement after a meeting with Lombardi on the issue.\nRosica said that Vatican staff were not sure the pope \u201cknew fully each of the people he was meeting\u201d while greeting people at the nunciature.\nNow, after issuing a separate statement clarifying that the pope\u2019s secret meeting with Davis \u201cshould not be considered a form of support of her positions,\u201d it seems even the Vatican doesn\u2019t want to get in the middle of the U.S.\u2019s debate on the issue.\n\"The pope did not enter into the details of the situation of Mrs. Davis and his meeting with her should not be considered a form of support of her position in all of its particular and complex aspects,\" Lombardi said.\nDavis\u2019 attorney Mat Staver disagrees with this assessment, however, and told the Associated Press that the Vatican had initiated the meeting with her, during which he reportedly thanked her for her courage and told her to \u2018stay strong.\u2019Thomas Rosica, who assists the Vatican press office with English-language media, said Friday that Vatican staff did not organize the meeting."}
