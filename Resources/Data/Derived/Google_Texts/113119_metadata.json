But almost never does the act take place from toddler to parent \u2014 except for one Chinese two-year-old, Gao Qianbo, who has been pre-chewing his mother\u2019s food ever since she awoke from a coma in May.\n\nGao\u2019s mother, Zhang Rongxiang, 42, got in a near fatal car accident in 2010, at a time when she was four months pregnant. Her husband, Gao Dejin, cared for her at home despite Zhang having slipped into a coma. She eventually delivered her baby boy on July 22, 2011 via Cesarean section, still comatose.\n\nZhang finally awoke from her coma in May of this year to the sound of her 2-year-old beside her. She remains in a vegetative state, and her son diligently attends to her, talks to her, and even pre-chews her food, Global Times reports.\n\nThe family survives mainly on government subsistence and support from friends and relatives.\n\nAs a practice, premastication may have evolutionary roots due to its ability to transfer crucial enzymes to infants that are unique to parental saliva, such as alpha-amylase, which aids in the digestion of starches fed to a baby. One 2009 study also found infants can benefit immunologically from premastication, developing resistance to asthma and other allergic responses.\n\nThrough cross-cultural studies, the team found the practice was grossly underestimated in prominence in non-Western countries. Roughly 63 percent of Chinese university students received premasticated food as infants, despite zero of eight ethnographic studies performed on the topic identifying it in their reports. The team concluded that pre-chewing a child\u2019s food confers a host of health benefits, and that excluding it has posed consequences for the modern infant\u2019s diet.\n\n\u201cIts abandonment,\u201d the researchers wrote, \u201cparticularly in poor communities, has placed children at increased risk of inadequate nutrition and decreased ability to confront infections associated with the introduction of complementary foods.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "gao qianbo, pre-chews, mother's food, paralyze, premastication", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Two-year-old Gao Qianbo pre-chews his mother's food now that she's paralyzed and cannot feed herself.", "title": "2-Year-Old Toddler Pre-Chews Paralyzed Mother's Food", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/gao-qianbo-2-year-old-toddler-pre-chews-paralyzed-moms-food-and-feeds-her-mouth-mouth-257689", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/23/pre-chews.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Two-year-old Gao Qianbo pre-chews his mother's food now that she's paralyzed and cannot feed herself.", "title": "2-Year-Old Toddler Pre-Chews Paralyzed Mother's Food", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/gao-qianbo-2-year-old-toddler-pre-chews-paralyzed-moms-food-and-feeds-her-mouth-mouth-257689", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/23/pre-chews.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/23/pre-chews.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2013-09-23T16:45:29-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-23T16:45:27-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Two-year-old Gao Qianbo pre-chews his mother's food now that she's paralyzed and cannot feed herself."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2dc2\"", "article_summary": "Zhang finally awoke from her coma in May of this year to the sound of her 2-year-old beside her.\nHer husband, Gao Dejin, cared for her at home despite Zhang having slipped into a coma.\nBut almost never does the act take place from toddler to parent \u2014 except for one Chinese two-year-old, Gao Qianbo, who has been pre-chewing his mother\u2019s food ever since she awoke from a coma in May.\nThe team concluded that pre-chewing a child\u2019s food confers a host of health benefits, and that excluding it has posed consequences for the modern infant\u2019s diet.\nThrough cross-cultural studies, the team found the practice was grossly underestimated in prominence in non-Western countries."}
