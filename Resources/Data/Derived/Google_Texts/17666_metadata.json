This is everybody\u2019s burden.\u201d\n\nResearchers from the San Francisco-based Center for Youth Wellness and Public Health Institute in Oakland aim to shed light on how early adverse experiences, such as abuse, neglect, and household dysfunction \u2014 including divorce and parental incarceration \u2014 might impact a child\u2019s health for a lifetime.\n\nDr. Nadine Burke Harris is a pediatrician and founder of the Center for Youth Wellness. She says the study looked at data from more than 27,000 surveys conducted by the California Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System over four years between 2008 and 2013.\n\nShe says the results surprised even her. For starters, so-called adverse childhood experiences, or ACEs, are common across race, income, education and geography. Nearly 62 percent of Californians reported at least one traumatic childhood event, and one in six had experienced four or more. People in the northern rural counties of Humboldt and Butte reported the most ACEs. The lowest numbers came from Santa Clara and San Mateo counties, where just over half of respondents reported such experiences.\n\n\u201cPeople sometimes assume this is a low-income issue,\u201d says Burke Harris, \u201cThis is everybody\u2019s burden, every taxpayer.\u201d\n\nIn part, she says this is because traumatic childhood experiences can make a child\u2019s natural response to stress go haywire and cause lasting damage. This is known as childhood toxic stress, a concept Burke Harris says has just begun to gain traction over the past five years.\n\n\u201cToxic stress affects the entire developmental trajectory of the child,\u201d Burke Harris says, \u201cthe changes to your DNA, the changes to your hormonal systems, as well as the changes to your immune system and neuro-development.\u201d\n\nHigh doses of such adversity increase risk of chronic diseases, heart disease, asthma, even Alzheimer\u2019s disease. People with four or more ACEs are poorer, less likely to get a college degree and are nearly 40 percent more likely to be unemployed later in life.\n\nThe term \u201cACEs\u201d was first coined in the late 1990s after Vincent Felitti of Kaiser in conjunction with a Centers for Disease Control researchers published the original ACEs study. But that study was in Kaiser members who were overwhelmingly caucasian and most had a college education. The \u201cHidden Crisis\u201d report is the first to use sample size more representative of the demographics of California, Marta Induni, research director at the Public Health Institute, told the Chronicle of Social Change.\n\nBurke Harris is hopeful that momentum around early interventions will save lives and money. She\u2019s calling for ACE training for physicians, in-home screenings, and what she calls the gold standard: two-generational services that includes both parents and children, like that utilized by University of California San Francisco\u2019s Infant Parent Program and Child Trauma Research Program.\n\n\u201cWhere a child has a high ACE score, often times you have a parent with high ACE score and that often predisposes for the conditions the child is in,\u201d says Burke Harris, With two-generational services, \u201cwe\u2019re seeing improved school functioning, and a reduction in chronic disease outcomes, like asthma hospitalizations, et cetera.\u201d\n\nBurke Harris says more research is needed on the impact of other types of negative childhood experiences that the original surveys did not consider, including bullying, racism and community violence.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Nearly 62 percent of Californians reported at least one traumatic childhood event.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Study Shows Childhood Trauma a \\u2018Hidden Crisis\\u2019 Across California\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2014\\/11\\/06\\/study-shows-childhood-trauma-a-hidden-crisis-across-california\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-11-06 10:07:13\",\"mod_date\":\"2014-11-10 09:49:46\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":22395,\"author_id\":\"8344\",\"author_name\":\"State of Health\",\"author_display_name\":\"State of Health\",\"tags\":[\"Children's Health\"],\"categories\":[\"Community Health\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2014\\/11\\/iStock_000011627266_LargeCROP-e1415297090876.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "Nearly 62 percent of Californians reported at least one traumatic childhood event.", "title": "Study Shows Childhood Trauma a \u2018Hidden Crisis\u2019 Across California", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2014/11/06/study-shows-childhood-trauma-a-hidden-crisis-across-california/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2014/11/iStock_000011627266_LargeCROP-640x473.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "children\\'s health", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca539\"", "article_summary": "By Sara HossainiA first-of-its kind report released Wednesday suggests Californians are facing a hidden public health crisis that stems from childhood trauma.\nDr. Nadine Burke Harris is a pediatrician and founder of the Center for Youth Wellness.\nFor starters, so-called adverse childhood experiences, or ACEs, are common across race, income, education and geography.\nThis is known as childhood toxic stress, a concept Burke Harris says has just begun to gain traction over the past five years.\nBurke Harris is hopeful that momentum around early interventions will save lives and money."}
