Unfortunately, as the president pivots away from the disastrous drubbing Democrats in the midterms, looking for cover in foreign affairs won\u2019t bring much solace. The climate there isn\u2019t much better overseas: a toxic mix of ISIS, Russian adventurism in Ukraine, Iran playing the U.S. for time on nukes, and China flexing its military clout in Asia only serve to highlight the pitfalls of Obama\u2019s foreign policy. The president will be talking trade on his Asia swing \u2013 a topic expected to find common ground among Republicans in Congress \u2013 but as with his domestic policy travails a quick scan of news tells you there\u2019s little Obama can point to bolster the reality of a weakened presidency, and global U.S. posture.\n\n\n\n[\u201cWe are very concerned by intensified fighting in eastern Ukraine, as well as numerous reports\u2026that Russian backed and supplied separatists are moving large convoys of heavy weapons and tanks to the front lines of the conflict. We continue to call on all sides to strictly adhere to the cease-fire.\u201d \u2013 From a White House statement Sunday on heavy fighting in Ukraine.]\n\n\n\nPutin cozies up to China - WSJ: \u201cAs ties between Moscow and Washington have frayed over Russia\u2019s intervention in Ukraine, [Russian] President Vladimir Putin has turned to China. The Russian and Chinese leaders have strengthened their relationship in defiance of the U.S. as the West has tried to isolate Moscow with economic sanctions. They presided over the signing of a natural gas agreement earlier this year and have developed a personal relationship that [President Obama] has failed to achieve with either [Chinese President Xi Jinping] or Mr. Putin despite White House efforts. During his three-day stay in China, Mr. Obama will come face to face with Mr. Putin for the first time since June...\u201d\n\n\n\n[\u201cThe airstrikes have been very effective in degrading ISIL\u2019s capabilities and slowing the advance that they were making. Now what we need is ground troops, Iraqi ground troops, that can start pushing them back. \u2013President Obama on \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d]\n\n\n\nPoor intel impedes strikes on ISIS - NYT: \u201cMore than three months into the American-led air campaign in Iraq and Syria, commanders are challenged by spotty intelligence, poor weather and an Iraqi Army that is only now starting to go on the offensive against the Islamic State, meaning that warplanes are mostly limited to hitting pop-up targets of opportunity\u2026only one of every four strike missions \u2014 some 800 of 3,200 \u2014 dropped its weapons, according to the military\u2019s Central Command. In Syria, the United States has a very limited ability to gather intelligence to help generate targets. Many Islamic State training compounds, headquarters, storage facilities and other fixed sites were struck in the early days of the bombing, but the military\u2019s deliberate process for approving other targets has frustrated several commanders. In neither country are American commandos conducting raids on militant camps or safe houses, operations that in Afghanistan and in the Iraq war generated a continuous trove of information for additional missions.\u201d\n\n\n\nOBAMA DOUBLES DOWN ON GO-IT-ALONE IMMIGRATION THREAT\n\nFox News: \u201cPresident Obama repeated Sunday that he intends to change U.S. immigration law through executive action, over Republican leaders\u2019 repeated requests to wait and dire warnings about the consequences of sidestepping Congress. \u2018I\u2019m going to do what I need to do,\u2019 Obama told CBS\u2019 \u2018Face the Nation,\u2019 \u2026\u2018If a bill gets passed, nobody would be happier than me,\u2019 Obama said\u2026 \u2018I believe [executive action] will hurt cooperation on every issue,\u2019 Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., told \u2018Fox News Sunday.\u2019 \u2018I think it would be like the president pulling the pin out of a hand grenade and throwing it in as we are trying to actually work together. I am hoping that cooler heads at the White House can prevail.\u2019\u2019\u2019\n\n[\u201cWe got beat\u2026 And so whenever, as the head of the party, it doesn't do well, I\u2019ve got to take responsibility for it, The message that I took from this election, and we've seen this in a number of elections, successive elections, is people want to see this city work.\u201d \u2013President Obama on \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d]\n\nPen power could prompt budget battle - Republicans may have some ammunition to make a pre-emptive strike should the president take executive action on immigration, picking a fight before the deadline to pass a short-term spending bill. WSJ: \u201c\u2018If the president really is serious about acting unilaterally on immigration, then it may be that we need to keep short-term funding mechanisms available to us in order to fight back,\u2019 said Rep. Mick Mulvaney (R., S.C.)\u2026 It is unclear how many other Republicans will lobby their leaders to pick a fight before this year\u2019s spending deadline or pass a short-term bill that extends into early 2015, when they will assume control of both chambers. House GOP leaders plan to discuss options with their rank-and-file at closed-door meetings this week.\u201d\n\n[Newly elected Republican Sens. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W. Va., and Cory Gardner, R-Colo., casted their legislative priorities on \u201cFox News Sunday with Chris Wallace.\u201d Watch here.]\n\nTHE JARRETT FACTOR\n\nWith eyes on possible shakeups in President Obama\u2019s administration following his party\u2019s midterm losses Tuesday, New Republic\u2019s Noam Scheiber takes a deep dive on one of Team Obama\u2019s most trusted advisers: Valerie Jarrett,noting just how expansive her role in the administration is: \u201c[President Obama] has said he consults Jarrett on every major decision, something current and former aides corroborate. \u2018Her role since she has been at the White House is one of the broadest and most expansive roles that I think has ever existed in the West Wing,\u2019 says Anita Dunn, Obama\u2019s former communications director. Broader, even, than the role of running the West Wing. \u2026Jarrett\u2019s inescapable presence made her an object of fear and scorn. \u2018It\u2019s pretty toxic,\u2019 says another former administration official. \u2018She went to whatever meeting she wanted to go to\u2014basically all of them\u2014and then would go and whisper to the president. Or at least everyone believed she did\u2026People don\u2019t trust the process. They think she\u2019s a spy.\u201d\u2019\n\nSCRAMBLE FOR BACKUP PLANS AHEAD OF OBAMACARE REBOOT\n\nFollowing last year\u2019s botched rollout of ObamaCare\u2019s Web site, the Obama administration is scrambling with backup plans in case things go awry again. Some of the last minute are efforts are coming down to the wire ahead of Saturday\u2019s open enrollment reboot. WaPo: \u201cDespite such efforts, the confidential documents written in recent weeks hint at elaborate backup planning that undercuts the administration\u2019s predictions that an improved HealthCare.gov will be able to handle everyone who wants to sign up\u2026 One document from late October, for instance, describes a new system known as \u2018throttling,\u2019 which will be deployed if the number of people trying to use HealthCare.gov at the same time strains the Web site\u2019s enlarged capacity. This throttling could send groups of people using different parts of the site into separate online \u2018waiting rooms\u2019\u2026 Other confidential CMS documents show that federal health officials drafted contingency plans involving notices for people who have insurance through the exchanges. The notices provide important information, such as whether enrollees appear eligible for federal subsidies for the coming year. The notices were supposed to be in consumers\u2019 hands by Nov. 1. But by the third week of October, a document says, fewer than 1 million of 7.6 million notices were ready to be mailed or e-mailed.\u201d\n\n[Watch Fox: Chief National Correspondent Jim Angle examines what the future holds for ObamaCare.]\n\nVA CHIEF CLEANS UP\n\nThe Hill: \u201cVA Secretary Bob McDonald told CBS\u2019s \u201860 Minutes\u2019 that the department aims to simplify the process because too many patients \u2018don\u2019t know where to go.\u2019 He will formally make the announcement on Monday, one day before Veterans Day and about 100 days into his tenure. Some of the changes will be behind the scenes, such as streamlining the nine different organizational structures across the country. The department will also create a website that allows people to have \u2018one entry point\u2019 into the system, he said. McDonald said the current system, which requires multiple user names and passwords, is \u201cnot acceptable.\u201d Another key improvement will involve a \u201ccustomer service representative\u201d that can offer one-on-one help. He also pledged to take action against people who violated the department\u2019s mission \u2013 as many as 1,000 employees.\u201d\n\nWITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE...\n\nThis week marks 25 years since the Berlin Wall fell. Senior Foreign Affairs Correspondent Greg Palkot reflects on his first assignment as a foreign correspondent, witnessing the events that led to the collapse of communism: \u201cIt was cold. It was wet. It was amazing. In those heady days following the fall of the Berlin Wall, we were there as the first waves of East Germans poured through a breach in the barrier. \u2018There is so much here,\u2019 one said to me, his family in tow. \u2018This must be a very rich land,\u2019 another remarked. Those of us lucky enough to be assigned the story knew we were covering a big chunk of history. There was too much joy and celebration all around to dwell on the politics. A people who had been kept down and oppressed against their will by a communist Soviet regime were set free overnight. Of course, that was just the beginning of eastern Germany\u2019s long road to normalcy. But it had begun. More than that, it set into motion a chain of events throughout eastern Europe and the former Soviet states that would change the world. The end of the Cold War. The demise of Communism\u2026But like those brave, bedraggled and dazzled East Germans, streaming through the gap in that Cold War concrete barrier 25 years ago, those seeking freedom still can in the end come out on top. And we\u2019ll be watching.\u201d\n\n[NY Post has the scoop on recently released secret recordings former president Ronald Reagan made with foreign leaders including Margret Thatcher and Pakistani President Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq.]\n\nGot a TIP from the RIGHT or LEFT?

Elizabeth Warren] have almost identical sentiment ratings \u2014 57% positive and 40% negative for Clinton; 56% positive and 40% negative for Warren. Fascinatingly, Joe Biden, though subject of just a quarter Clinton\u2019s volume of conversation, is also viewed in a warmer light, with 67% of the conversation about him positive \u2014 a hint of the sort of politician, raw and authentic and occasionally stumbling, who thrives in this new medium. On the Republican side, Chris Christie is the most discussed figure, but the results are far more mixed: 47% of the sentiment is positive, 45% negative\u2026.The most warmly viewed Republicans are Condoleezza Rice and [Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis.] Sentiment about Jeb Bush, meanwhile, is underwater.\u201d\n\n\n\nGovs rule - \u201cI do think if we\u2019re [Republicans] going to beat Hillary Clinton in this next election, we\u2019ve got to have a message that says, \u2018Hillary Clinton is all about Washington.\u2019 I think in many ways, she was the big loser on Tuesday because she embodies everything that\u2019s wrong with Washington\u2026Paul Ryan may be the only exception to that rule. But overall, I think governors make much better presidents than members of Congress.\u201d\u2014Gov. Scott Walker, R-Wis., on \u201cMeet The Press.\u201d\n\n[How\u2019d she fair Howie? - #mediaBuzz host Howard Kurtz goes beyond the headlines to ask if Hillary Clinton was helped by the Democrat\u2019s midterm wipe out: \u201cThe midterms were probably a wash for Hillary. This whole notion that when a big shot goes out and campaigns for candidates and gets some credit for the victories and some blame for the defeats \u2014 it\u2019s a journalistic construct. Most voters don\u2019t care about endorsements.\u201d]\n\nWarren butters up Hollywood with populist pitch - Hollywood Reporter: \u201cSen. Elizabeth Warren, [D-Mass.] regarded by many progressive Democrats as their party\u2019s alternative to Hillary Clinton, told an ACLU gala in Beverly Hills Sunday that \u2018economic opportunity is slipping further and further out of reach\u2019 for average Americans. She said bluntly: \u2018We have to face the game is rigged in Congress\u2019\u2026In too many instances \u2014 whether it\u2019s raising the minimum wage or appointing non-corporate lawyers to federal judgeships \u2014 the playing field in Washington is tilted against working Americans,\u2019 Warren said.\u201d\n\n\n\nDubbya ready for Jeb run - Former president George W. Bush said there is a \u201c50-50\u201d chance his brother, former Gov. Jeb Bush, R-Fla., will run for president in 2016. \u201cI occasionally fuel the speculation by saying that I hope he runs,\u201d Bush told CBS News. \u201cHe and I are very close. On the other hand, he\u2019s not here knocking on my door, you know, agonizing about the decision. He knows exactly -- you know, the ramifications on family, for example. He\u2019s seen his dad and his brother go through the presidency.\u201d The 43rd president added, \u201cIf he wants me out there publicly, I\u2019ll be out there publicly. If he wants me behind the scenes, I\u2019ll be behind the scenes. You know, I\u2019ll\u2014I\u2019m all in for him.\u201d\n\n\n\n[Family matters - WSJ: \u201cIn his new book\u2026Bush writes that his father [George H. W.

The spot features a May speech Cassidy gave to the Republican leadership conference in which he stumbles over his words as a narrator rips Cassidy for cuts to social security benefits and tax cuts for the wealthy.\n\n\n\n[Byron York: \u201cGOP strategists with years of work in Louisiana are wary of declaring victory a month before the election. \u2018We\u2019ve been close to knocking Mary out before,\u2019 says the Republican. \u2018In 2002, Republicans had a big night in November, and December people sort of let their guard down and she was able to win. The point is, we can't take it for granted.\u2019 The fact is, the outlook for Cassidy looks very good. But it is also true that one-foot putts are occasionally missed. Despite all the factors in their favor, that is what Louisiana Republicans are trying to keep first in their mind between now and December 6.\u201d]\n\n\n\nOUTSTANDING VOTES EXPECTED TO SEAL SULLIVAN VICTORY\n\n[Alaska] News Miner: \u201cThe Alaska Division of Elections will begin counting outstanding votes on Tuesday\u2026In the race for the U.S. Senate, [Republican Dan Sullivan] currently has 110,203 votes to [Sen. Mark Begich\u2019s, D-Alaska] 102,054. Sullivan is anticipated to pick up 24,363 more votes and Begich is anticipated to pick up 22,366 more votes. That leaves Begich with a wider gap than he saw on election day, at a 10,146 vote deficit. Supporters are quick to point out Begich fared well in his 2008 victory over former U.S. Sen. Ted Stevens, [R-Alaska] rising from a 7,000 vote deficit to a 3,000 vote victory after absentee ballots were counted. This number could potentially shift in Begich\u2019s favor if there\u2019s a surge of absentee ballots from Democratic-leaning rural districts that heavily favored the Democratic incumbent on Tuesday. But the total number of outstanding ballots is smaller than in 2008.\u201d\n\n\n\nSASSE DEEPENS NEBRASKA\u2019S RED ROOTS\n\nJust how big was Sen.-elect Ben Sasse\u2019s, R-Neb., win Tuesday? The Lincoln Journal star breaks it down: \u201cYou\u2019ve got to go back to Gov. Jim Exon\u2019s [D-Neb.] first Senate victory in 1978 to find a bigger win. That\u2019s the only Nebraska Senate victory in an open-seat election that was larger than the one Sasse racked up last week. Exon defeated Republican nominee Don Shasteen by 35.4 percentage points 36 years ago. Sasse defeated Democratic nominee Dave Domina by 33.7 points last week\u2026Some of the county-by-county results in the Sasse-Domina matchup recall the old Republican joke in rural Nebraska that \u2018we spray for Democrats out here.\u2019 Banner, 249-31; Chase, 1,201-125; Dundy, 591-69; Furnas, 1,341-213; Hayes, 399-33;Sheridan, 1,451-206.\u201d\n\n\n\nDEMAIO CONCEDES CLOSE CONTEST\n\nAP: \u201cRepublican Carl DeMaio on Sunday conceded defeat to incumbent Scott Peters in one of the nation\u2019s most hotly contested congressional races to represent a large part of San Diego, ending a bitter campaign that was rocked by claims that he sexually harassed a former staffer. DeMaio, who is openly gay, said he will work within his party to make it more inclusive, echoing a theme of his campaign.\u201d\n\n\n\nDEMS PLOT MIDTERM POST-MORTEM\n\nAP: \u201cDemocrats are planning an extensive review of what went wrong in the 2014 and 2010 elections, hoping to find ways to translate success in presidential campaigns into future midterm contests. A party committee will conduct a \u2018top-to-bottom assessment\u2019 of the Democrats' performance in recent midterm elections and try to determine why they have struggled to turn out its core voters in nonpresidential election\u2026 \u2018Our party has a problem,\u2019 [Democratic National Committee head Debbie Wasserman Schultz ]said in a video announcing the project.\n\n\n\n[\u201cWhere the hell is the Democratic party?

Hal Kreitman, of Miami Beach, is facing multiple charges over his up-close interactions with the creatures. The 51-year-old has posted videos online of himself petting the alligators and even giving one a kiss on the nose. The former chiropractor, who calls himself \u2018The Haligator\u2019, was arrested in the Florida Keys on 29 October. Undercover wildlife officials reported seeing him lead guests into the Everglades for encounters with the reptiles. Police also said he began charging tourists $250\u2026 to come and see him in the water with the creatures. Kreitman faces a felony charge of enticing and capturing an alligator, which he denies\u2026Kreitman acknowledged his pastime is risky. \u2018I\u2019m not going to say I\u2019m never going to get bit,\u2019 he told Sky News, \u2026\u2018When I\u2019m in the water, I\u2019m thinking what he\u2019s thinking; he\u2019s thinking what I\u2019m thinking.
