MANASSAS, Va. — The Greater Prince William Community Health Center will open a second location thanks to a federal grant.

The clinic in Woodbridge that provides free or low-cost healthcare will expand to Manassas and is expected to open at 9705 Liberia Avenue, next to the Continental Events Center, and where University of Phoenix once housed its Northern Virginia campus.

The $650,000 grant to open the center was awarded by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Announced by Director Kathleen Sebelius, the money is part of $150 million made available for public health centers as part of the Affordable Care Act also known as Obamacare.

Like the clinic in Woodbridge, the center will also be directed by Frank Principi, who also serves as an elected member of the Prince William County Board of Supervisors. He will lead a team of at least 20 new staff members at the Manassas facility when it opens in March. Many of the services at the Woodbridge clinic – which employs 68 people – will also be offered at the new clinic.

Here’s more in a press release:

The Center will replicate its award-winning health care services at the new location, including primary, dental, behavioral, and OB-GYN services for the whole family under one roof. The Center’s Level III Designation for Patient Centered Medical Home (PCMH) is currently pending a decision by the National Committee For Quality Assurance (NCQA). The Center’s second site will provide affordable access to health care services for working families in the region. The site will also provide an economic boost to the area both in terms of job creation and economic development.

The new center has set a goal to serve 5,000 new patients during its first year, and will improve the health of those living in Manassas nad Manassas Park, according to a press release:
