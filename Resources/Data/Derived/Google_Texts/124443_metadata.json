The exercise calls for the students to \u201ccolor an anatomical picture from the \u201cThe Cunt Coloring Book.\u201d Other take-home exercises include \u201cPleasure Point,\u201d in which the student is asked to find a \u201cpleasurable activity\u201d and write about it.\n\nThe decision to give FemSex a second shot came from University Honors Program director Amelia Zurcher. Although the honors program provides official sponsorship for the workshop, it does not contribute to funding.\n\n\u201cFemSex empowers (participants) to understand, respect, and appreciate their own sexuality, and use it in just and healthy ways,\u201d Zurcher told the The Marquette-Tribune. \u201cThe venue it creates helps foster a more inclusive, respectful and intellectually curious environment on campus.\u201d\n\nThe sex ed workshop is already a part of the University of California, Berkley\u2019s curriculum and is being adopted by Brown University and Columbia University this fall. A good portion of Marquette\u2019s faculty is at odds with the university\u2019s decision to reintroduce FemSex, including associate political science professor John McAdams.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s bad judgment on the part of the Honors Program to sponsor it,\u201d McAdams explains on his blog Marquette Warrior. \u201cIf there were some actual technical expertise involved, it might be more of a legitimate academic exercise.\"", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "marquette, university, sex, ed, workshop, femsex", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Marquette University's sex ed workshop, FemSex, has garnered both positive and negative reviews from faculty and students.", "title": "College Sex Workshop Features 'C#%T Coloring Book,' Draws Controversy", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/sex-ed-marquette-universitys-femsex-workshop-features-ct-coloring-book-and-other-tools-studying", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/25/sex-ed.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Marquette University's sex ed workshop, FemSex, has garnered both positive and negative reviews from faculty and students.", "title": "College Sex Workshop Features 'C#%T Coloring Book,' Draws Controversy", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/sex-ed-marquette-universitys-femsex-workshop-features-ct-coloring-book-and-other-tools-studying", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/25/sex-ed.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/25/sex-ed.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2013-09-12T10:57:13-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-25T11:25:22-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Marquette University's sex ed workshop, FemSex, has garnered both positive and negative reviews from faculty and students."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0e2f\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIt\u2019s bad judgment on the part of the Honors Program to sponsor it,\u201d McAdams explains on his blog Marquette Warrior.\nAmong the workshop\u2019s take-home activities, \u201cCunt Coloring\u201d has garnered the most attention.\nThe decision to give FemSex a second shot came from University Honors Program director Amelia Zurcher.\nAlthough the honors program provides official sponsorship for the workshop, it does not contribute to funding.\n\u201cFemSex empowers (participants) to understand, respect, and appreciate their own sexuality, and use it in just and healthy ways,\u201d Zurcher told the The Marquette-Tribune."}
