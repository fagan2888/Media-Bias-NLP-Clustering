They got good benefits, and the pay\u2019s decent, so why not?\u201d Hanna said.\n\nBut he also cited challenges, such as smelly conditions, mud, heat and ants.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot to it, but it still beats no job at all,\u201d Hanna said.\n\nWhen asked about discarded items, Hanna said, \u201cYou see everything.\u201d\n\nAnd Drennan said he\u2019s seen people throw away money-change and dollar bills.\n\n\u201cA lot of times people throw it away because they think a dollar\u2019s not worth anything,\u201d he said.\n\nEven so, Galen Billington, residential superintendent with Tyler\u2019s Solid Waste Department, said garbage men are not allowed to take items from the trash.\n\nDrennan said he enjoys working by himself, because he seems to work better that way and can listen to his style of music.\n\nHowever, he said, the job is not as easy as some think.\n\n\u201cSome people think it\u2019s easy to throw a trash can upon the back of a truck and dump it,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot more to it than just that. You\u2019ve got to have stamina. You\u2019re working in the weather whether it\u2019s hot, cold (or) raining.\u201d\n\nKenneth Wooten, 47, has been a garbage collector in Tyler for 17 years.\n\nHe said he slipped into the job and ended up liking it.\n\nWhen asked what he enjoys about it, he said, \u201cBeing in a truck by yourself, you\u2019re pretty much your own boss.\u201d\n\nWooten, who collects from big dumpsters at businesses, said the job can be dangerous when lifting a dumpster at least 13 or 14 feet over the truck.\n\nHe could hit a power line, he said, and recalled a time when a person raised their head up from a dumpster he was moving. He then put the dumpster back down.\n\nDaron Choice, 50, has been with Tyler Solid Waste about 28 years.\n\nHe said he was getting out of high school and looking for a job when he ran across a job with Solid Waste. He started in residential and now works with commercial dumpsters.\n\nHubert Vance, 52, has been doing garbage collection for more than 20 years, seven in Tyler.\n\nHe said the first thing got him into doing Solid Waste was the response from residents and the sincerity they had in thanking him for picking up trash.\n\nIt \u201ctouched me, and have been doing it for quite some time,\u201d Vance said.\n\nToday, he said he still enjoys the sincerity from people when they show appreciation of thank him for a job well done.\n\n\u201cI love it,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "TylerPaper.com", "description": "William\u00a0Drennan was doing garbage pickup at Hideaway Lake when he noticed a number on a res...", "title": "Nat'l Garbage Man Day: Tyler honors men who collect city's trash, waste - TylerPaper.com", "url": "http://www.tylerpaper.com/TP-News+Local/201600/natl-garbage-man-day-tyler-honors-men-who-collect-citys-trash-waste", "image": "http://www.focusinon.me/photos/i-8TZvDq4/0/L/i-8TZvDq4-L.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@tylerpaper"}, "fb": {"admins": "1651519031,627844030", "app_id": 210861005636155}, "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf5ea\"", "article_summary": "Drennan, 42, has been a garbage man in Tyler for two years and in the trash business for 18 years.\nDaron Choice, 50, has been with Tyler Solid Waste about 28 years.\nThe city of Tyler this past week recognized them as part of National Garbage Man Day.\nWilliam Drennan was doing garbage pickup at Hideaway Lake when he noticed a number on a resident\u2019s arm.\nIt is estimated 2,000 tons of solid waste is collected each week in the city, as well as 30 tons of recycling."}
