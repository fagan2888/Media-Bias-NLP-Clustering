Ten years after being convicted for her role, Odeh was released from incarceration as part of a prisoner exchange.\n\nIllinois, like Florida, actually conducts background checks of Obamacare navigators before they\u2019re allowed to work, but the FBI failed to uncover Odeh\u2019s terrorist activities, according to the National Review, which reported:\n\nAccording to the director of insurance\u2019s Oct. 25, 2013, revocation letter, the Department of Insurance found out about Odeh\u2019s history after the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office for the Eastern District of Michigan, notified the public about her prior convictions. Odeh, who has as many as nine aliases, was indicted in October for allegedly lying on her U.S. immigration and naturalization application papers. On Dec. 9, 2004, she had been sworn in as a U.S. citizen in a district court in Michigan, the same state where bombing victim Kanner had spent six months studying English. If Odeh is convicted, she could lose her U.S. citizenship and serve up to 10 years in prison. Separately, the Illinois Insurance Code permits civil penalties to be levied after a hearing on any Obamacare navigator whose certificate has been denied, suspended or revoked.\n\nUnder intense questioning in November by U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius admitted it was possible felons would be hired as Obamacare navigators. No one asked her if an international terrorist might also join the payroll.\n\nFox News\u2019 \u201cOn the Record\u201d host Greta Van Susteren interviewed Jillian Melchior, the National Review reporter who broke the story.
