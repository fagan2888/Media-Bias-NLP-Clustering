Members of the Aurora Police Department SWAT unit were deployed in the 14400 block of East Mississippi Avenue, according to a 4:02 p.m. police Twitter post.

Streets in the area were sealed off as police attempted to get the man to surrender.

Eastbound Mississippi Avenue was closed at South Blackhawk Street, westbound Mississippi at South Sable Boulevard; and southbound Sable was closed at Mississippi, police said.
