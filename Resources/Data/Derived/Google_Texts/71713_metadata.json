That\u2019s in Alaska, and ever since a horticulturalist discovered this bit of peony trivia, growers here have been planting the flowers as quickly as they can. While speaking at a conference in the late 1990s, Pat Holloway, a horticulturalist at University of Alaska Fairbanks and manager of the Georgeson Botanical Garden, casually mentioned that peonies, which are wildly popular with brides, were among the many flowers that grew in Alaska. After her talk, a flower grower from Oregon found her in the crowd. \u201cHe said, \u2018You have something no one else in the world has,\u2019\u201d she recalls. \u201c\u2018You have peonies blooming in July.\u2019\u201d Realizing the implications of his insight, Holloway planted a test plot at the botanical garden in 2001. \u201cThe first year, they just grew beautifully and they looked gorgeous,\u201d says Holloway. She wrote about her blooms in a report and posted it online. To her surprise, a flower broker from England found the reports of her trials and called to order 100,000 peonies a week. Holloway laughed, informing him that she only had a few dozen plants. But she told a few growers around the state, and that was enough to convince several to plant peonies of their own. \u201cAnd once they started advertising them, they found out\u2014you can sell these,\u201d says Holloway.\n\nIt helps that peonies not only survive, but thrive in Alaska. \u201cUp here, the peonies go from breaking through the soil to flowering within four weeks,\u201d says Aaron Stierle, a peony farmer at Solitude Springs Farm in Fairbanks. \u201cThat\u2019s half the time it takes anywhere else in the world.\u201d Blooms from Alaska are unusually big, up to eight inches across, from the long hours of sunshine. The state\u2019s harsh climate staves off most diseases and insects. Even moose\u2014one of the state\u2019s most common garden pests\u2014aren\u2019t a threat, as they hate the taste of peonies. But their biggest advantage, which that Oregon grower was so keen to point out, is in filling a seasonal gap in the global market that could elevate peonies to the status of roses, in an elite club of cut flowers that are available all year long. Flower markets from England to Taiwan are eager to place orders for Alaska\u2019s midsummer beauties and so are brokers from coast to coast here in the states, where Alaska's peonies bloom just in time for late summer weddings. But first, the peony growers in Alaska must endure the early pains of starting a new industry. Elizabeth Beks/North Pole Peonies Ron and Marji Illingworth, who live in the Alaskan town of North Pole, were growing vegetables when they first heard of Holloway\u2019s research. They soon planted 25 peonies alongside their carrots and beans and are now one of the biggest growers in the state, selling 7,000 peonies last year as North Pole Peonies. As many as 58 peony farms have sprouted up in Alaska, capable of producing about 200,000 peonies a year. Marji Illingworth estimates that just in her region, growers will sell a million dollars worth of peonies by 2020. With their off-season blooms, Alaska\u2019s growers can fetch $4 a flower, while Dutch growers who sell \u201cduring the glut of the season\u201d in April and May can only charge 28 cents. That\u2019s still a far cry from meeting the demand of the English caller who wanted 100,000 flowers a week, as well as the many other buyers who have since taken notice of Alaska\u2019s peonies. From her living room in late spring, looking out at fields still covered in snow, Marji Illingworth rattles off a list of requests Alaska growers have received: 200,000 stems a week to the East Coast, 10,000 to Taiwan and a few hundred thousand to Dubai. \u201cThe market\u2019s huge,\u201d says Richard Currie, owner of Pennsylvania-based Styer\u2019s Peonies and a 30-year veteran of the cut flower business. \u201cI don\u2019t think they need to worry about the market.\u201d\n\nBecause of the great demand, growers in the state have enjoyed premium prices. \u201cWe\u2019re selling peonies now for two to three times more than we figured we could to pay off [our initial investment],\u201d Ron Illingworth says, settled into a rocking chair across from his wife. Holloway says Alaska\u2019s growers can fetch $4 a flower, while Dutch growers who sell \u201cduring the glut of the season\u201d in April and May can only charge 28 cents. It\u2019s no wonder, Marji Illingworth says, that the Dutch have started to freeze peonies in order to try to resell them later in the summer. She\u2019s not worried, since she says the size and shelf life of her peonies still far outperform those of the frozen Dutch flowers. Even with the promise of high prices and endless demand, some growers remain cautious. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot more apprehension in those of us who are just getting started in it,\u201d Stierle says, who has been in business for about half as long as the Illingworths. He worries about variable weather patterns\u2014like those that caused roughly half of the peony roots in the state to die last summer, presumably from too much rain. And the payoff still seems far in the distance to farmers like Stierle, since peonies don\u2019t fully mature for five to seven years. \u201cRight now, it seems like there\u2019s a whole lot of people jumping on the bandwagon,\u201d says Holloway. \u201cBut when you put peonies in the ground, you\u2019re stuck. That\u2019s a long term commitment.\u201d Another challenge is that new growers must use trial and error to find the right peony varieties and the best growing techniques. There\u2019s one variety that everyone plants: Sarah Bernhardt, a light pink flower that is especially tolerant of the cold. Holloway has also planted 110 varieties in research plots at the botanical garden, but that doesn\u2019t even come close to the 7,000 that exist. For all the rest, growers must order and plant them to see how they'll fare\u2014and that gets expensive, since peony roots cost about $10 apiece.", "article_metadata": {"description": "For late-summer weddings, the peonies can only come from one place.
