Bush in 2000 campaign\n\nImmigration: \u201cAs President, I will stop illegal immigration, build a wall that works, triple border security, and put in place the surveillance and biometric tracking to secure the border.\u201d\n\nAbortion: Pro-life, \u201cI have been proud to fight\u2026 and stand against Planned Parenthood, to defend life for my entire career.\u201d\n\nForeign Policy: \u201cWe should not be allowing Muslim refugees from countries where ISIS and al Qaeda have control of significant amounts of territory.\u201d\n\nTaxes: \u201cWe should let taxes become so simple that they could be filled out on a postcard.\u201d\n\nHealth care: \u201cI support repealing every single word of Obamacare.\u201d\n\nEducation: \u201cIf I am elected president I will direct the U.S. Department of Education that the Common Core ends today and I will fight to abolish the federal Department of Education.\u201d\n\nCrime and Safety: \u201cI\u2019m proud to stand with law enforcement, to stand with the police and firefighters and first responders\u2026 they need a President who doesn\u2019t vilify them and who doesn\u2019t seek to tear us apart\u2026\u201d\n\nDemocratic Candidates\n\nHillary Clinton\n\nCurrent Position: American politician\n\nHistory: New York Senator, First Lady of the United States, Secretary of State\n\nImmigration: \u201cI will stand up against any effort to deport dreamers.

And I will defend Planned Parenthood.\u201d\n\nForeign Policy: \u201cWe have to fight in the air, fight on the ground, and fight them on the Internet. We have to do everything we can with our friends and partners around the world.\u201d\n\nTaxes: \u201cThe wealthiest pay too little in taxes while the middle class needs more relief. I\u2019m going to fix that. I\u2019ll close corporate tax loopholes and make sure millionaires and billionaires can\u2019t pay lower rates than middle-class families. And I\u2019ll give tax relief to working families who are struggling with costs from college to health care.\u201d\n\nHealth care: \u201cI\u2019ll defend the Affordable Care Act, build its successes, and go even further to reduce costs.\u201d\n\nEducation: \u201cI would like students to work ten hours a week in order to contribute to their education.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re going to make community college free.\u201d\n\nCrime and Safety: \u201cWe want to get rid of the non-violent low-level offenses being a way to go into jail or prison.\u201d\n\nBernie Sanders\n\nCurrent Position: Vermont Senator\n\nHistory: longest-serving independent in United States congressional history\n\nImmigration: \u201cMake sure that 11 million undocumented people in our country no longer have to live in the shadows, no longer have to live in fear, but can live in security and dignity.\n\nAbortion: \u201cThe current attempt to discredit Planned Parenthood is part of a long-term smear campaign by people who want to deny women in this country the right to control their own bodies.\u201d\n\nForeign Policy: \u201cI will never forget those people who told us how easy it was to go into Iraq and how quickly our troops would come home.

We need to start raising the bar for Israel and holding them to an equal standard for supporting human rights and international law and ending occupations and illegal settlements and apartheid.\u201d\n\nTaxes: \u201c\u2026will fight any attempt to balance the budget through tax or fee hikes that hit ordinary taxpayers.\u201d\n\nHealth care: \u201cIn fact, birth control should not be up to your employer, nor should vaccinations or blood transfusions or any other aspect of healthcare that might be objected to on religious grounds. Healthcare is a human right. We should be providing it now for everyone.\u201d\n\nEducation: \u201cTo ensure that our students have a strong, secure economic future, how about we bail out the students instead of bailing out the banks for the fourth time?\u201d\n\nCrime and Safety: \u201cOver seven million [Americans] are under \u201ccorrectional supervision\u201d, 10 times greater than in 1965, as incarcerating poor people\u2013disproportionately of color\u2013has become big business with the failed war on drugs.

There is nation-building and rebuilding to be done right here at home.\u201d\n\nTaxes: \u201cWe need to get rid of the income tax. Giant, slow corporations spend their money on lobbying because tax avoidance is where their profit is.\u201d \u201cWhen anyone purchases a new good or service for personal consumption, be it a DVD or a yacht, the person is taxed. Fair-tax doesn\u2019t tax used goods or business-to-business purchases.\u201d\n\nHealth care: \u201cI would have the federal government cut Medicare and Medicaid by 43% and block grant the programs [to the states] with no strings.\u201d\n\nEducation: \u201cI suggest that if student loans did not exist\u2013and I am not advocating that\u2013 tuition would be a lot lower because colleges and universities want to deliver their product, and if there weren\u2019t as many kids going to school because it costs too much, they would find ways to lower their price.\u201d\n\nCrime and Safety: \u201cHalf of all crime is drug-related. If we legalized drugs, we would destroy the environment that allows and even encourages all those crimes.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Vector - NJIT's Student Newspaper", "description": "By Prasanna Tati 2016 Presidential Republican and Democratic Candidate Profiles Republican candidates John Kasich Current Position: Ohio governor History: Ran for President once before in 2000 Immigration: \u201cIf they\u2019ve been law-abiding, then I think they should stay.\u201d Abortion: \u201cPro-Life\u201d, but \u201cthere are legitimate exceptions on rape, incest, and life of the mother\u201d, tried to defund Planned Parenthood in Ohio Foreign Policy: \u201cWe can\u2019t wait any longer.
