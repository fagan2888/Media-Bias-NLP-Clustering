He covers the law and LGBTQ issues.\n\nThat\u2019s the message that Judge Jeffrey Sutton seemed to telegraph during Wednesday\u2019s gay marriage oral arguments at the 6th Circuit. Sutton is the swing vote on the circuit panel: To his left is Judge Martha Craig Daughtrey, a Clinton appointee and staunch liberal; to his right is Judge Deborah Cook, a thoroughly right-wing George W. Bush appointee. Sutton, also placed on the bench by Bush, is a genuine conservative and a former clerk of one Justice Antonin Scalia. (Scalia calls him \u201cone of the very best law clerks I ever had.\u201d) But ever since Sutton upheld Obamacare in 2011, he\u2019s been lauded on the left for his judicial independence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nWill that independence lead Sutton to strike down gay marriage bans in Michigan, Kentucky, Ohio, and Tennessee? Or will his conservatism push him to uphold the states\u2019 laws? Based on Wednesday\u2019s arguments, marriage advocates have good reason to worry. Unlike Cook, who clearly viewed gay marriage prohibitions as a rational state policy, Sutton seemed to scowl at the prospect of excluding an entire class of people from marriage. But unlike Daughtrey\u2014who fiercely questioned the state\u2019s interest in discriminating against gays at every turn\u2014Sutton appeared exceedingly hesitant to bring gay marriage to America through judicial fiat.\n\nSutton has two hang-ups. The first is not terribly unreasonable. In a 1972 case called Baker v. Nelson, the Supreme Court dismissed a challenge to Minnesota\u2019s gay marriage ban \u201cfor want of a substantial federal question\u201d\u2014that is to say, the court didn\u2019t see a constitutional flaw in the ban. The case was decided through a summary affirmance of a lower court ruling, meaning the justices didn\u2019t hear arguments or write a real opinion. But a summary affirmance is generally considered to be binding precedent on lower courts.\n\nYou might think that Justice Anthony Kennedy would confront Baker\u2014the only Supreme Court precedent to deal directly with the merits of state gay marriage bans\u2014when he overturned DOMA. But instead, he ignored it, perhaps in an effort to leave the whole question of state-level bans for another day. Every district court that has since struck down these bans worked around Baker by citing a somewhat ambiguous loophole: A summary affirmance might not be controlling precedent when it has since been undermined by \u201cdoctrinal developments.\u201d\n\nThe question for Sutton, then, is simple: Does the trio of great gay rights cases (Romer, Lawrence, and Windsor) render Baker\u2019s holding completely moot? Or does Baker remain binding precedent? Sutton seemed to lean toward keeping Baker on life support for now and letting the Supreme Court pull the plug, noting:\n\nEven when you see one line of cases crumbling, lower courts aren\u2019t allowed to infer, and anticipatorily overrule, this other line of cases. So as a matter of hierarchy, aren\u2019t we stuck with Baker?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nBut then Sutton seemed to walk back his statement, musing that \u201cthe legal reasoning in other cases\u201d\u2014Romer, Lawrence, and especially Windsor\u2014were \u201ctotally inconsistent with Baker.\u201d At the end of his colloquy on the topic, he seemed a little stumped, and more than a little frustrated.\n\nEven if Sutton moves beyond the Baker hump, however, he\u2019s got another, more profound hang-up: He wants to leave gay marriage to the democratic process. It was probably this respect for legislative authority and separation of powers that led Sutton to uphold Obamacare\u2014but here it seemed to be leading him to a more conservative conclusion. At one rather awkward point, Sutton launched into a strange monologue about the gay rights movement\u2019s tactics, one that seemed barely tethered to the merits of the case at hand:\n\nI would\u2019ve thought the best way to get respect and dignity is through the democratic process. Forcing one\u2019s neighbors, co-employees, friends, to recognize that these marriages, the status deserves the same respect as the status in a heterosexual couple. \u2026 If the goal is to change hearts and minds \u2026 isn\u2019t it worth the expense? Don\u2019t you think you\u2019re more likely to change hearts and minds through the democratic process than you are through a decision by five justices of the U.S. Supreme Court?\n\nThese words should be very unnerving for supporters of same-sex marriage. Don\u2019t come to us with your demands for equal protection and fundamental rights, Sutton implied; take your case to the voters instead. Being a legal stranger to your spouse and child isn\u2019t so bad, he suggests, that you need to turn to the federal courts for relief. This reasoning stands in stark contrast to Kennedy\u2019s Windsor opinion, which explained that marriage bans \u201cdemean\u201d gay couples and \u201chumiliate\u201d their children. In Kennedy\u2019s eyes, gay marriage bans \u201cdegrade\u201d gay people. In Sutton\u2019s eyes, they merely annoy them.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.tags": "sixth circuit gay marriage, sixth circuit judge Sutton, sixth circuit same-sex marriage bans, sixth circuit gay rights, gay marriage ban supreme court, same-sex marriage supreme court", "sailthru.author": "Mark Joseph Stern", "description": "The heady era of the\u00a0post-Windsor\u00a0winning streak\u00a0may soon come to a crashing halt.
