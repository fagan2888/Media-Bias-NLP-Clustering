Another asks \u201cDoes stress have a negative impact on your quality of life?\u201d The answers range from \u201cNever\u201d to \u201cSometimes\u201d to \u201cAll the Time.\u201d The surveys are completely anonymous.\n\nThe survey is part of a national trend that came into focus with the passage of the Affordable Care Act. \u201cWe are mandated to lay the groundwork beyond what five people sitting around a table think,\u201d says Baird. \u201cIn order to really make a difference and concentrate on potential solutions we need a broad range of residents to take the survey. Get your friends, families, neighbors, and clients to go online and spend a few minutes giving your opinions.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis survey is an opportunity for all residents to inform and direct how we as a county will work to improve our health and community resources today and into the future,\u201d says Miles Gordon, Leadership Mendocino Class XIX and NCO Food Systems Director who represents North Coast Opportunities on the CHNA committee.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to get a representative cross section that reflects as much as possible what Mendocino looks like as a whole,\u201d says Baird. \u201cThis is a way to connect community wide efforts through our own personal experiences.\u201d\n\nThe coalition will use the findings to develop a Community Health Improvement Plan that prioritizes the health needs of Mendocino County residents and sets goals as well as short-and long-term strategies to achieve them.\n\n\u201cThis is our opportunity to have a say in which issues we feel are top priority that need to improve and we can work on as a community,\u201d says O\u2019Ferrall.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOnce the results are tabulated and prioritized, the CHNA committee will reach out again to the public to share their findings. Community input will be included to finesse the results and help prioritize an action plan. The CHNA coalition includes Healthy Mendocino, the comprehensive website that is partnered with the 211 call center, Ukiah Valley Medical Center, Frank Howard Hospital, the Mendocino Coast Clinics, Alliance for Rural Community Health Care, Mendocino County Health and Human Services, and North Coast Opportunities.\n\nThe survey is available on Healthy Mendocino.org and Mendocino County\u2019s Public Health website. It is also available in print form, in English and Spanish, from Patrice Mascolo, director of Healthy Mendocino at 467-3228 or healthymendocino@ncoinc.org and Samantha Kinney, data analyst at Mendocino County\u2019s Health and Human Services Agency, at 472.2793 or kinneys@co.mendocino.ca.us.\n\nHeidi Cusick Dickerson is the director of Leadership Mendocino, a ten month program that explores Mendocino County issues, opportunities and challenges.
