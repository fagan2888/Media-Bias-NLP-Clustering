That\u2019s a promise,\u201d Obama said recently. \u201cAfter all, this country is at its best when we look out for each other. And together, we can help more Americans get the security that they and their families deserve.\u201d\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nObama directed his message to the 20 cities that participate in Obamacare\u2019s Healthy Communities Challenge launched last week. From the White House press release about the new program:\n\nAt the end of this third open enrollment period, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), along with State-based Marketplaces, will publish tallies of new Marketplace signups in participating communities. These tallies will be compared to HHS estimates of the number of eligible uninsured people at the start of open enrollment to see which communities made the most progress during the challenge. The victorious community gets bragging rights, a healthier community, and a visit from President Obama to celebrate their success in helping ensure every American has health coverage.\n\nSelect cities participating in the Challenge are: Dallas, Texas; Tampa, Fla.; Atlanta, Seattle, Great Falls, Mont.; Salt Lake City, Kansas City, Mo.; Chicago, Phoenix, Detroit, Charlotte, New Orleans, Denver, Milwaukee, Philadelphia, Las Vegas, Oakland, Calif.; Richmond, Va.; and Long Beach, Calif.\n\nIn an announcement last month, Health and Human Services Secretary (HHS) Sylvia Burwell said she expects 10 million individuals to be enrolled through the Health Insurance Marketplaces at the close of 2016.\n\n\u201cAs the law\u2019s coverage provisions have taken effect, 17.6 million Americans have gained coverage, and the nation\u2019s uninsured rate now stands at its lowest level ever,\u201d said the White House press release regarding Obama\u2019s broadcast. \u201cThe ACA is working, making health care more affordable, accessible, and of higher quality for millions of people. But there are still Americans around the country who are eligible for Marketplace coverage yet remain uninsured.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Barack Obama says: sign up, see me.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "President Barack Obama says: sign up, see me.", "title": "Obama To Reward City With Highest Obamacare Sign-ups With Visit From Him - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/09/Obamacare-Supreme-Court-AP.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/11/09/obama-reward-city-highest-obamacare-sign-ups-visit/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "President Barack Obama says: sign up, see me.", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/09/Obamacare-Supreme-Court-AP.jpg", "title": "Obama To Reward City With Highest Obamacare Sign-ups With Visit From Him - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "affordable care act, Government-Run Health Insurance, Healthy Communities Challenge, Open enrollment season, Secretary Sylvia Burwell, uninsured,Big Government, Obama, Obamacare,Obama", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "uninsured", "published_time": "2015-11-09T11:53:12-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,Obama,Obamacare"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERPresident Barack Obama is offering himself as a reward to the city that signs up the highest percentage of enrollees in his signature healthcare reform during open enrollment season.\n\u201cI\u2019ll come visit the city that enrolls the highest percentage of folks who aren\u2019t covered right now.\nThe victorious community gets bragging rights, a healthier community, and a visit from President Obama to celebrate their success in helping ensure every American has health coverage.\n; Salt Lake City, Kansas City, Mo.\nBut there are still Americans around the country who are eligible for Marketplace coverage yet remain uninsured.\u201d"}
