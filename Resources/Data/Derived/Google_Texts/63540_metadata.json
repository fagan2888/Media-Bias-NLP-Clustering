Sodexo employs 1,000 Vermonters in 27 locations, about 3 percent of whom lost their benefits, Sodexo spokesperson Enrico Dinges said. The company provides food services to the University of Vermont, St. Michael\u2019s College, the Vermont State Colleges, Norwich University and other institutions.\n\nVermont State Colleges Chancellor Tim Donovan said Friday he did not have enough information to comment on the decision, though he did say that Sodexo had scheduled a meeting with VSC officials next week.\n\nSodexo announced in September that it would reclassify some employees as part-time workers, making them ineligible for health care coverage. Though many food services employees work at least 40 hours during the academic year, Dinges said, the company planned to average their work hours over a 52-week cycle. The total averaged out to less than the 30 hours a week minimum for health care coverage under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nNow the company is going to credit employees with time they haven\u2019t worked over the year. Dinges said an economic analysis \u201cshowed that we could remain competitive and still reward our employees.\u201d\n\nThe proposal to reclassify workers drew a sharp response in Vermont after it was announced last fall. Sen. Philip Baruth, D-Chittenden, told VTDigger that he received a barrage of email complaints from Sodexo workers, though there was little public comment on the matter.\n\nAnnie Noonan, the commissioner of the Vermont Department of Labor, determined that Sodexo\u2019s reclassification was legal. Baruth then took a different tack against Sodexo, introducing a bill banning penalties for employees who took sick leave. The bill passed in the Senate and was voted down in the House.\n\n\u201cThey were clearly making a legal decision that was designed to fatten their bottom line at the expense of their workers. It really had nothing to do with Obamacare,\u201d Baruth said. \u201cIt took about three questions to get them to admit that.\u201d\n\nDinges, however, said the decision was made to increase consistency and improve efficiency across branches of the multinational company.\n\n\u201cLast year, it was really about being competitive in the market, seeing what other companies around us were doing, and complying with the Affordable Care Act,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were making a policy that would allow us to track full-time work consistently across the board. If you have this many employees, you have to make a tracking system that is pretty comprehensive.\u201d\n\nDinges estimated that the increased health care costs the company is taking on would have an economic impact \u201cin the tens of millions.\u201d\n\nAccording to previous reports, UVM has 320 Sodexo employees, and last fall, former VSC spokesman and VTC interim president Dan Smith said the system\u2019s four campuses (VTC-Randolph, Johnson, Lyndon and Castleton) employed 109 full-time Sodexo workers. A total of 69 of those employees would be affected by the change in eligibility requirements, 23 of whom receive health insurance through Sodexo, Smith said at the time.\n\nUVM, St. Michael\u2019s College and the Vermont State College system refused to approve the proposed changes in their contracts with Sodexo. Donovan said that the VSC made the decision due to a lack of information. UVM President Tom Sullivan wrote a letter prohibiting Sodexo from moving forward \u201cuntil further notice.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is part of Sodexo\u2019s contract with UVM that major changes in personnel policy need to be approved by the university. That was the case here, and we advised that Sodexo put the policy change on hold while we reviewed its implications,\u201d said Tom Gustafson, Vice President for University Relations and Administration.\n\nSodexo and UVM officials said they were unable to comment Friday on whether Sodexo actually went through with the proposed changes.\n\nBaruth, who is also employed as a UVM English professor, acknowledged the company\u2019s change of heart.\n\n\u201cTo give them their due, they were a generous employer,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause of the seasonal nature of the college work, Sodexo has traditionally recognized their employees as full-time workers. The decision to reclassify was really out of character. Now I think they came to their senses.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "labor department, philip baruth, sick leave, sodexo, tim donovan, uvm food service workers, vermont state colleges, vermont, vermont news, vermont events, vermont press releases", "og": {"site_name": "VTDigger", "description": "Company that provides food service to many Vermont colleges walks away from plan to reclassify workers in a way that would have made them ineligible for health care benefits.", "title": "Sodexo backs away from change in full-time employee rules", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Sodexo-FULL.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-06-28T09:51:53+00:00", "url": "http://vtdigger.org/2014/06/27/sodexo-backs-away-change-full-time-employee-rules/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Company that provides food service to many Vermont colleges walks away from plan to reclassify workers in a way that would have made them ineligible for health care benefits.", "title": "Sodexo backs away from change in full-time employee rules", "image": "http://i2.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Sodexo-FULL.jpg?fit=500%2C335", "creator": "@vtdigger", "site": "@vtdigger", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "keywords": "Sodexo, UVM food service workers, Labor Department, Philip Baruth, sick leave, Vermont State Colleges, Tim Donovan", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/vtdigger", "section": "Business & Economy", "tag": "Vermont State Colleges", "published_time": "2014-06-27T18:05:45+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-28T09:51:53+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcde08\"", "article_summary": "In January, approximately 5,200 of the total 133,000 Sodexo employees nationwide will once again be eligible for company health plans.\n\u201cBecause of the seasonal nature of the college work, Sodexo has traditionally recognized their employees as full-time workers.\nThe total averaged out to less than the 30 hours a week minimum for health care coverage under the Affordable Care Act.\nSen.
