The aftermath of Friday's drowning was a sad sight for anyone who saw the Ford Mustang pulled from the water. The flash flood near Emporia along the Kansas Turnpike took the life of a 21-year-old man.

"It's just a tragic event that didn't need to happen," said Wichita Fire Captain Chris Conover. "If they would have followed safety rules none of that would've happened."

The Wichita Fire Department's Technical Rescue Team has boats and diving gear to respond to these types of calls. Conover says drivers often underestimate the depth and power of the water.

"You can be swept away in 6 inches of water and carried away in 12 inches of water and have no control," said Conover.

If you car winds up in deep flood water, it can turn dangerous in an instant. Car submersion experts say cars usually sink in about a minute.

KAKE News is on your side with tips for how to react:

First remove your seat belt, then roll down a window to escape before the car goes under. If you can't get the window down, rescuers say immediately move on to a back up plan.

"Break a window any way you can, typically the corner of your window," said Conover. "Crack the window and get out that way."

Car submersion experts say the common mistake is most people think you should roll up your windows and call 911; that can get you trapped and killed. Conover says speed is the key to saving your life.

"It only takes a matter of seconds to become a victim," said Conover. "You don't think it's going to happen to you but you can get swept off so quick."

The Kansas Department of Transportation says to honor all road barriers. If you see flood waters and don't know how deep they are, remember the phrase: turn around, don't drown.

On average, around 300 Americans die a year in submerged cars.
