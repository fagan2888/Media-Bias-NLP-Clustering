On a whim, I stop in the town of Corning, population 1600, in the least populated county in Iowa, to check out Ben Carson, the longest of longshot candidates among the then 17 candidates vying for the Republican nomination.\n\nThe retired neurosurgeon and author of numerous books not only has never held or run for office before; he has no governmental or military experience whatsoever, nor any tangible executive or business experience. However, his medical accomplishments, thoughts and ideas had inspired many, and they told him he should run for president. So he did.\n\nI walk into the Corning Opera House at 8:15 a.m., see nobody there, and my suspicions regarding Carson\u2019s electoral possibilities seem to be confirmed.\n\nThen a young man appears and says, \u201cOh, everyone\u2019s upstairs. We had so many people that we moved everyone into the auditorium.\u201d I go up the stairs, and the small theater is absolutely packed, with many holding copies of Carson\u2019s books. Carson then appears, holds the microphone close to his face, and, for the next hour, talks in a mostly monotone voice \u2014 and seemingly with his eyes shut \u2014 to an appreciative and enthralled crowd.\n\nHe talks about his candidacy. \u201cI\u2019m not a politician, and never will be.\u201d He says, \u201cThe pundits all said it couldn\u2019t be done, that Carson can\u2019t possibly be successful. Right now all their heads are exploding.\u201d\n\nHe talks about religion \u2014 \u201cWe\u2019ve forgotten God. Don\u2019t be ashamed to talk about God\u201d \u2014 and warns that the country is in great danger from insidious forces. \u201cThere is a progressive, secular agenda that is in the process of taking over this nation. It has been successful in destroying family values and ridding the U.S. of the strength of our Judeo-Christian values. They don\u2019t care what you think; they just want you to be quiet and accept it.\u201d\n\nHe then tells a story about Benjamin Franklin imploring his fellow delegates at the Constitutional Convention to turn to God for guidance. He says the delegates then \u201call knelt and prayed, and when they got up, they wrote one of the most admired founding documents in the history of the world.\u201d\n\nCarson doesn\u2019t give a lot of policy specifics but does say that he wants to repeal Obamacare and replace it with health savings accounts. He also wants to enact a six-month corporate tax holiday to bring money and companies back to America, \u201cthen use that money that comes in for job training and hiring those in poverty.\u201d\n\nHe criticizes the U.S. debt and future unfunded financial liabilities, a \u201cfiscal gap\u201d that he says will total $200 trillion. He says that he would like to add a new function to the Department of Education: \u201cMonitoring our institutions of higher learning \u2014 colleges and universities \u2014 for extreme political bias. If it exists, they get no federal funding.\u201d\n\nI next see Carson in September at an Iowa Faith and Freedom Coalition event in Des Moines. He appears via satellite hookup and talks about the \u201cmany who want to minimize the role of faith in our lives,\u201d and blames the \u201cPC police\u201d and \u201csecular progressives.\u201d\n\nHe stresses that America is a Judeo-Christian nation. \u201cNot by law, but we are by tradition.\u201d He says that the citizens decide what values and principles to adopt, and \u201cif we pick the right ones, this nation will once again begin to flourish.\u201d\n\nCarson tells the Benjamin Franklin story again, saying Franklin told the delegates to get down on their knees and seek wisdom from God, \u201cAnd they all knelt, and when they prayed, they got up and they put together a sixteen and a third page document known as the Constitution of the United States.\u201d\n\nThe story was intriguing, so I did some research.\n\nIndeed, Franklin did ask that a chaplain be commissioned for the Constitutional Convention to lead a prayer every morning asking for divine guidance. And later convention delegates did attend church services, and later still a chaplain was appointed to the first Constitutional Congress. But the delegates didn\u2019t fall to their knees upon Franklin\u2019s appeal. The definitive source on the episode is Franklin himself, who wrote, \u201cThe convention, except three or four persons, thought prayer unnecessary.\u201d\n\nIt is late December, and I\u2019m in Mason City, Iowa, to see Carson one last time. Things have changed dramatically since June. Carson now is surrounded by several large men from the U.S. Secret Service, and while political veterans such as Rick Perry, Scott Walker, Lindsey Graham, and George Pataki have dropped out of the race, Carson not only is still in it, but polls also show him doing well both in Iowa and nationally.\n\nHe continues to stress he thinks the national debt and \u201cfiscal gap\u201d must be ameliorated, and if not, America will go the way of ancient Rome, 17th century Spain, and 18th century France \u2014 \u201cPinnacle nations just like we are that lost track of fiscal responsibility, and look what happened.\u201d\n\nHe also says his opposition to Obamacare is based more on opposition to a government mandate than on whether it gets people health care. \u201cThat\u2019s the real reason I\u2019ve railed against it so hard,\u201d he said. \u201cNot so much because it didn\u2019t work, not so much because it wasn\u2019t affordable, but really because it was beginning the transition of America into another system. And I think if we go much further down that road, it will be considerably too late for us.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a theme Carson comes back to throughout his remarks, the idea that there are forces out there \u2014 be they \u201cthe left,\u201d \u201csecular progressives,\u201d \u201csocialists,\u201d or \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d \u2014 that are leading the country to ruin.\n\n\u201cIf we get another secular progressive and they get two or three Supreme Court picks, America as we know it will no longer exist,\u201d he says. \u201cI can guarantee you the secular progressives are going to be encouraging you not to vote.\u201d\n\nBen Carson is certainly an unconventional candidate with an unconventional style and background, and his campaign themes have been consistent since I first saw him in June: Anti-big government, anti-liberal, and sounding the alarm that a traditional way of life is under attack by manipulating and perfidious agents of destruction from the left.\n\nIn Carson\u2019s view, an unconventional candidate, a \u201cnonpolitician,\u201d is exactly what the GOP needs in a standard bearer this year: \u201cPeople say, you\u2019re not tough because you\u2019re soft spoken. Toughness is not determined by the number of decibels with which you speak. Toughness is determined by what you\u2019ve been able to overcome. And I defy anybody else who is running to put up a list of accomplishments that even begins to compare.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "News, Local, Opinion, Columns", "og": {"site_name": "CJOnline.com", "description": "Corning, Iowa - It is a very early late June morning and I am driving into Iowa to see GOP presidential candidate Ted Cruz.", "title": "Bob Beatty: Ben Carson sounding the alarm", "url": "http://cjonline.com/news/2016-01-23/bob-beatty-ben-carson-sounding-alarm", "image": "http://cjonline.com/sites/default/files/15068157.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "Corning, Iowa \u2014 It is a very early late June morning and I am driving into Iowa to see GOP presidential candidate Ted Cruz.
