They have no serious opposition to free enterprise or a more limited welfare state, but nonetheless feel that the GOP has nothing to offer.\n\nThe reason is social rightism.\n\nOne of its pillars is opposition to same-sex marriage. In January, 2013, Breitbart.com editor Adam Shapiro told me that \u201cthe conservative movement gave up the ghost long ago by failing to defend the sanctity of marriage.\n\n\u201cConservatives allowed marriage to be redefined as a relationship of love between two people, rather than a relationship of love between two people consummated for the purpose of procreating and raising healthy children.\n\nREAD ALSO: Social conservatism lost in 2012 and will lose in November\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen marriage ceased to be about children and became solely about the relations of the two people involved, the principle basis for marriage was redefined: love, commitment, and consent, but not child-rearing. That basis clearly allows for different forms of marriage.\u201d\n\nTalk of marriage\u2019s societal influence brings us to the religious right, a large voting bloc dominated by fundamentalist Christians. For decades, it has enjoyed a stranglehold on GOP public policy.\n\nDave Nalle, chairman of the Republican Liberty Caucus, says that \u201c(w)here we do run into problems with the religious right is with those small but influential groups which believe that they should promote their beliefs by using government as an instrument to impose them on other people.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t understand that this is a terrible practice which can be turned against them and they use tactics which are essentially the same as the secular humanists from the left who are their greatest enemies. Ultimately I don\u2019t see much future for this element in the Republican Party or even in mainstream politics.\n\n\u201cWhen they are fanatical about forcing their beliefs on everyone through legislation they make themselves so unpopular that they become a political liability which no party can afford to get involved with.\n\n\u201cThe incident in the [2102] election with extreme statements from Todd Akin demonstrates how damaging religious extremism can be to a party which needs to attract independents and moderates. Akin\u2019s statements and similar ones from several other candidates cost us not only the seats they were running for, but spilled over and probably cost Republicans about 2 percent of their support nationwide, which did enormous damage.\n\n\u201cWhether libertarian or not, party leaders realize that we cannot afford to carry that kind of liability.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: COTTO: Marco Rubio is the clear choice for a Clinton victory in 2016\n\n\n\nFew issues provide the Republican brand with more liability than abortion rights. Many voters perceive hostility toward these rights as eroding women\u2019s equality.\n\n\u201cI do think there is an inherent attack on women\u2019s abilities to run their own lives,\u201d former New Jersey Governor and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Christine Todd Whitman told me in 2012. \u201cThe Republican Party needs to speak to the issues that women care about \u2014 taxes, education, and health care. And the party needs to give more than lip service to female candidates \u2014 putting women up in places they can actually win, not just showing off a female candidate in a race she\u2019s bound to lose.\n\n\u201cWe as a party need to be cultivating our female candidates and giving them financial support when they choose to run.\u201d\n\nTheology-inspired crusades are pushed by politicos who emerge from heated primaries. These folks find a home for their extremism like no other when these primaries are closed to non-GOPers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be a problem as long as candidates win general elections running on extreme base issues,\u201d Whitman explained. \u201cWhat will stop it is when those more extreme candidates lose those elections after winning primaries running on the far-right issues. Those candidates are running on issues that are not key for the majority of the voting public.\n\n\u201cA few polls that came out right before the Obamacare Supreme Court decision came down gave a window into what voters care about \u2014 they were far more focused on jobs, taxes, and the economy than even the repeal of \u2018Obamacare.\u2019\n\n\u201cIf health care isn\u2019t the major concern, abortion and gay marriage are clearly only base issues \u2014 they appeal to a small, but extremely vocal minority.\u201d\n\nSocial conservatism is ultimately a losing prospect. Last November, Chris Christie ran on a moderate platform that fell in line with New Jersey\u2019s interests and won handily.\n\nVirginia\u2019s Ken Cuccinelli, on the other hand, pursued an ideological agenda which included \u2014 among other things \u2014 instituting anti-sodomy laws, supporting legislation which would criminalize all abortions along with certain forms of birth control, and forsaking environmental conservation. All of this left a terrible impression on the Old Dominion\u2019s mainstream, and he lost.\n\nRegardless of our own opinions about the GOP\u2019s path forward, one thing is clear: Social rightism will not dominate it. Difficult as this may be for some to accept, what other choice is there; a third party?\n\nAsk John B.
