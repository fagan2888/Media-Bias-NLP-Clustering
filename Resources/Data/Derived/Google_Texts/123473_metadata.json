After a short period, Miranda fled and officers pursued on foot.\n\nMiranda ran to a vacant lot in the 700 block of S. Hickman and took cover behind an abandoned vehicle.\n\nAltus Police said Miranda drew a pistol from a holster beneath his coat and pointed it at an officer. That\u2019s when one officer fired several shots. Miranda was hit twice in the chest before he surrendered himself to police.
