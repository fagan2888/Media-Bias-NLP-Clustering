(Mark Leffingwell / Daily Camera)\n\n\"The dual reality of a tiny planet became very clear to me very quickly,\" Sebelius said. \"Crises, outbreaks, emergencies, those are situations that don't recognize or stop with national boundaries.\n\n\"And yet neither does our capacity to counter them.\"\n\nSebelius went on to describe some of the key realities of a global society. She said that outbreaks anywhere affect countries and people all over the world.\n\nLast year, 7 million international passengers flew through Dulles International Airport in northern Virginia, Sebelius said, compared to 26,000 international passengers at that airport in 1963.\n\nShe also described how much of the food Americans eat is imported from around the globe, which makes it important for the country to pay attention to health and health decisions in New Zealand, for example.\n\n\"We live in a world where microbes and disease are moving faster and farther than ever, and we have to work together as a global community in order to counter them,\" she said.\n\nSebelius said that in the same way, advancements in health in one country are advancements for everyone in the world.\n\nShe said every country can benefit from preventing diseases such as HIV and AIDS, diabetes, and heart disease, no matter whose research finds the answer.\n\nSebelius also talked about how healthy people mean more prosperous economies around the world, and described how the total cost of smoking in the U.S. is $289 billion each year.\n\n\"That's being seen in countries around the world,\" she said. \"But in 2014, a drag on one economy pulls down other economies. We no longer have the luxury of not caring as much about what happens to people in other parts of the world.\"\n\nThe secretary, who was widely criticized for the botched rollout of the website healthcare.gov, hardly touched on President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, in the speech.\n\nWhen talking about smoking and tobacco usage, Sebelius mentioned how the Affordable Care Act gave much-needed support to prevention and cesasstion programs.\n\nIn closing, Sebelius described how global health can shape the world and the future by creating opportunities for cooperation and collaboration.\n\n\"In many ways, human health is the great global connector,\" she said. \"It aligns our interests and impacts all of our economies. It compels us to work together and actually punishes us if we drift apart.\n\n\"It calls upon the greatest human impulses for compassion, for health and for love, and it motivates our greatest human capacities for discovering innovation and invention.\"\n\nContact Camera Staff Writer Sarah Kuta at 303-473-1106, kutas@dailycamera.com or twitter.com/sarahkuta.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/cu-news/ci_25518258/kathleen-sebelius-at-cwa-human-health-is-great", "sailthru.author": "By Sarah Kuta ,  Camera Staff Writer", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:25518258:view"}, "startDate": "2014-04-07T22:33:16-0600", "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "Kathleen Sebelius, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services secretary,  addressed the increasingly interconnected world and its affect on global health, innovation and the economy Monday in Boulder as part of the opening day of the Conference on World Affairs.", "title": "Kathleen Sebelius at CWA: Human health is 'great global connector'", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/cu-news/ci_25518258/kathleen-sebelius-at-cwa-human-health-is-great", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2014/0407/20140407__08DCASEBw~1.jpg", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "CU News", "modificationDate": "2014-04-07T22:37:49-0600", "endDate": "2024-04-07T22:18:01-0600", "news_keywords": "CU News, CU News news, Boulder Colorado CU News news, Boulder Colorado news, CU News Boulder news, CU News Colorado news, US CU News news, world CU News news.", "byline": "By Sarah Kuta,", "pubDate": "2014-04-07T22:36:08-0600", "sailthru.date": "2014-04-07T22:33:16-0600", "sailthru.title": "Kathleen Sebelius at CWA: Human health is 'great global connector'", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2014/0407/20140407__08DCASEBw~1_300.jpg", "description": "Kathleen Sebelius, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services secretary,  addressed the increasingly interconnected world and its affect on global health, innovation and the economy Monday in Boulder as part of the opening day of the Conference on World Affairs.", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/cu-news/ci_25518258/kathleen-sebelius-at-cwa-human-health-is-great", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "Kathleen Sebelius, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services secretary,  addressed the increasingly interconnected world and its affect on global health, innovation and the economy Monday in Boulder as part of the opening day of the Conference on World Affairs.", "title": "Kathleen Sebelius at CWA: Human health is 'great global connector'"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}, "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2014/0407/20140407__08DCASEBw~1.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1541\"", "article_summary": "\"In many ways, human health is the great global connector,\" she said.\nHealth and Human Services secretary delivers keynoteKathleen Sebelius, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services secretary, addressed the increasingly interconnected world and its affect on global health, innovation and the economy Monday in Boulder as part of the opening day of the Conference on World Affairs.\nIn her speech \"The Globalization of Health,\" Sebelius discussed how interconnected the world's people are in both spreading and fighting disease outbreaks.\nIn closing, Sebelius described how global health can shape the world and the future by creating opportunities for cooperation and collaboration.\nKathleen Sebelius, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services secretary, delivers the keynote address in Macky Auditorium on Monday during the 66th annual Conference on World Affairs on the University of Colorado's Boulder campus."}
