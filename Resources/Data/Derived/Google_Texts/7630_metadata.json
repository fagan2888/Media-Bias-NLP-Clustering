It landed, crucially, in the same position it launched\u2014upright\u2014and that makes it look kind of like a science fiction film. You can watch the awesome video below:\n\nIt\u2019s called Morpheus. While it may never fly in space in its current form, Morpheus is designed to be a useful prototype mission for the space agency, something that engineers can learn and borrow ideas and mechanisms from. It runs on liquid oxygen and methane, two fuels which could be made on other planets. It\u2019s also designed to land on rocky or unstable terrain\u2014notice how, at the end of this video, it lands on soil that\u2019s downright Martianesque.\n\nMorpheus is, in fact, one of 20 projects that NASA is developing as part of its Advanced Exploration Systems program, which pushes at the edge of the agency\u2019s capabilities. The projects range from deep space habitats to radiation protection, from imaging near-Earth asteroids to automating the flight of the International Space Station. NASA is, in fact, asking for a larger budget for the program in 2015 (even as it seems to be making many other harmful cuts).\n\nNASA isn\u2019t the only organization developing a rocket like this. Last year, SpaceX\u2014the private space company owned by Elon Musk\u2014successfully tested a rocket which takes off and lands vertically, which it calls the Grasshopper, and which it filmed with (what else?) a drone.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Today, Florida; Tomorrow, Mars", "author": "Robinson Meyer", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "Today, Florida; Tomorrow, Mars", "title": "The NASA Rocket That Hovers Like a Helicopter (but Could Land on Mars)", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2014/03/Screen_Shot_2014_03_06_at_10.14.22_AM/lead_large.png", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/03/the-nasa-rocket-that-hovers-like-a-helicopter-but-could-land-on-mars/284271/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/yayitsrob"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc99b4\"", "article_summary": "It\u2019s also designed to land on rocky or unstable terrain\u2014notice how, at the end of this video, it lands on soil that\u2019s downright Martianesque.\nNASA isn\u2019t the only organization developing a rocket like this.\nYesterday, a NASA test vehicle lifted off from the ground in Florida, flew freely through the air, and landed about 650 feet away.\nIt landed, crucially, in the same position it launched\u2014upright\u2014and that makes it look kind of like a science fiction film.\nNASA is, in fact, asking for a larger budget for the program in 2015 (even as it seems to be making many other harmful cuts)."}
