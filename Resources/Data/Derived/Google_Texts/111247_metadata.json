Hacking incidents, ransomware, and phishing scams could all potentially lead to issues in EHR security.\n\nHealthcare is an increasingly attractive target for unauthorized third parties because the data being stored in facilities will lead to much more lucrative gain than financial information alone.\n\n\u201cWeb-based EHR systems easily allow them to access data from hundreds or thousands of health networks in one fell swoop,\u201d Digital Guardian Principal Architect of Network and Cloud Security Mark Menke explained in a HealthITSecurity.com contribution piece. \u201cAdditionally, like other similar applications, it\u2019s likely that web-based EHR systems suffer from many common vulnerabilities that might give attackers access to backend systems and data \u2013 from SQL injections to cross site scripting.\u201d\n\nMenke added that EHR security measures need to be especially vigilant as the Affordable Care Act has created significant incentives for doctors\u2019 offices to embrace EHR systems.\n\n\u201cMost web-based EHR platforms allow physicians to reap the advantages of these efficient tools without needing to invest in hardware, software and IT staff to manage them \u2013 which is a big bonus in the healthcare industry, where the margins are small,\u201d he wrote.\n\nCertified EHR adoption by office-based physicians and hospitals according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology, and American Hospital Association.\n\nSource: ONC\n\nCollaboration is essential for comprehensive EHR security\n\nInformation security is a broad and complex challenge, according to Epic SVP and CSO Stirling Martin. However, the EHR is just one component in a complex ecosystem that also includes securing physical spaces, protecting credentials, networks, biomedical devices, mobile devices and other software.\n\nMartin told HealthITSecurity.com that while HHS lists lost or stolen devices as accounting for many of the breaches, criminal hacking is on the rise.\n\n\u201cCriminal hacking is a profitable, destructive criminal activity,\u201d Martin maintained. \u201cIt can also be state-sponsored like the breaches at Anthem and Sony. Can we reasonably expect a healthcare organization to defend itself against another country?\u201d\n\nA provider can no longer be effective against these kinds of attacks in isolation. Instead, Martin explained that security requires \u201ca collaborative, cross-industry safety effort with more cooperation across healthcare and non-healthcare organizations.\u201d This includes vendors, security organizations, and federal agencies, such as the FBI and NSA.\n\n\u201cToday, organizations in healthcare and other sectors are spending millions of dollars to increase their security with surveillance tools, network firewalls, intrusion prevention systems, host level security technologies, multifactor authentication, and integrating commercial threat intelligence. They are also beginning to work together against a common enemy.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe get far fewer questions on that, and a lot more questions on whether we have this technology or that technology. My point of view is, that\u2019s probably not the question to be asking.\u201d\n\nLooking toward the rest of 2016 and beyond, it\u2019s important to help healthcare providers by expanding the conversation around security, he urged. This includes looking at \u201cthe big picture, facilitate industry collaboration, lobby for reasonable liability caps, and properly label these attacks\u2014crimes by criminals.\u201d\n\nCommon healthcare provider concerns with EHR security\n\nWhile different healthcare providers will often have varied concerns about their EHRs, HIPAA privacy and security concerns are typically a top pain point, according to Chris Haeni, Executive Director of Networking and Security at athenahealth.\n\nMoreover, when athenahealth, which uses cloud-based software, is approached about security concerns, he added that it usually centers around whether the cloud is secure. There is a misconception in health care that only software, which can be installed in an organization\u2019s data center, is secure.\n\nHowever, if anything has been learned from large breaches, such as that which happened with Target, is that it doesn\u2019t matter what technology an organization is using if it\u2019s not being operated effectively, according to Haeni.\n\nRead: Why a Culture Change is needed for Healthcare Data Security\n\n\u201cWe receive far fewer questions on protocols and operating procedures, and a lot more questions on whether we have a specific technology. My point of view is, that\u2019s probably not the question to be asking.\u201d\n\nThis is because the majority of healthcare organizations are likely using a compliance-oriented security program, according to Haeni, but they should be using a threat-centric program.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, security is not a technology problem, it\u2019s a people problem. Organizations should work with technology partners to ensure there are sufficient protocols in place to protect data from specific viable threats.\u201d\n\nUnderstanding EHR security and ransomware\n\nRansomware is quickly becoming a more concerning area in the healthcare industry, as more providers have found themselves victims of an attack.\n\nThis is a type of malware that usually prevents an organization from accessing certain parts of its system or network. For example, hospital employees could find themselves locked out from critical systems, such as an EHR or patient records. The provider is unable to get in unless they pay a certain amount of money.\n\nThere are two main types of ransomware that organizations need to be mindful of: crypto ransomware and locker ransomware. With crypto ransomware, the data is encrypted and made unreadable. With locker ransomware, an organization is locked out of its system and unable to access the data.\n\nRead: Understanding Ransomware and Healthcare Data Security\n\nIn one recent case, a hospital was forced to pay $17,000 to regain access to its system. California-based Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center (HPMC) reportedly fell victim to a malware attack, and employees stated that they were unable to access certain parts of the hospital network.\n\nJust over one month later, Methodist Hospital in Kentucky reported that its servers were infected with the Locky ransomware virus. This particular virus copies all vital files, encrypts them, and then deletes the originals. The hospital\u2019s IT team shut down all of its computers and then verified if they had been affected. Notes were taken by hand during the downtime, according to some employees.\n\nRansomware attacks can seriously impact an organization\u2019s EHR security. While patient PHI might not be immediately exposed, the information is inaccessible. This could lead to patient safety issues if physicians and nurses cannot see all necessary information to treat an individual.\n\nOr, the PHI could still be viewed by the hackers in question, even if it is not released or exposed to the public.\n\nProtecting against this type of EHR security measure requires healthcare organizations to have a comprehensive data security approach that includes thorough employee training. Oftentimes, malware will infiltrate a system because an employee falls for a phishing scam. Staff members need to know what to look for in suspicious emails and know who to contact if something is found.\n\n\"Many health systems are used to managing security on their own, but a cloud provider is also going to be on the hook for security and can become a true partner to help organizations manage risk. That can be an advantage.\u201d\n\nSource: Thinkstock\n\nConsidering healthcare cloud security options\n\nOne of the key things in EHR security options is for healthcare organizations to be confident in the vendor\u2019s ability to keep their data secure. If a health care organization is filling out a questionnaire detailing its own security practices as part of the onboarding process, the vendor should also be able to confidently show how secure its own practices are.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy to ask our vendors to do the utmost in security, but it\u2019s very important for health care organizations to routinely audit their own security practices. In security we are only as strong as our weakest link,\u201d he noted. \u201cAt athenahealth, we\u2019ve got dedicated security operations teams, dedicated risk teams, and we do threat intelligence sharing with clients.\u201d\n\nHowever, at the end of the day, both entities must partner together to ensure proper security measures are in place. In the case of a healthcare specific cloud, entities like athenahealth are required by law to be HIPAA compliant, whereas this is not a requirement for software; with software the onus is on the health care system to operate it in a compliant manner.\n\nBecause of this, opting for a cloud offering can assist healthcare organizations, because they can share responsibility for all the controls necessary to protect the data, according to Haeni.\n\n\u201cMany health systems are used to managing security on their own, but a cloud provider is also going to be on the hook for security and can become a true partner to help organizations manage risk,\u201d he stated. \u201cThat can be an advantage.\u201d\n\nLooking ahead to healthcare data security issues in 2016\n\nUnderstanding which controls an EHR vendor is going to provide to an organization, and which areas the provider will still have to still operate is one key thing for covered entities to consider as they look for a new EHR security strategy, Haeni explained.\n\n\u201cThat needs to be clear and energy should be focused on that. Organizations don\u2019t figure that out probably until it\u2019s too late in the process. They should be really focused on that earlier.\u201d\n\nHaeni also cautioned that it\u2019s important for health systems\u2019 security teams to engage with a vendor before a contract is signed; a covered entity should have its security team on calls early, and involved with contract negotiations.\n\n\u201c[The security solution] may be partially or completely implemented, and only then does the security team start kind of post facto asking questions, such as \u2018Oh, what\u2019s this application? What\u2019s this service? Who\u2019s using it? What\u2019s the data?\u2019 And of course that is really ineffective.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re an organization with sensitive data, and you\u2019re not backing it up, your endpoints may potentially get infected this way. We see that as a pretty big threat in 2016.\u201d\n\nLooking ahead to the rest of 2016, Haeni said that simple mistakes from insiders will likely be a key issue that healthcare organizations need to keep in mind.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the HHS breach data over a long period of time, that\u2019s always been the case,\u201d Haeni warned. \u201cIt\u2019s the well-intentioned employee taking that laptop that\u2019s got 500,000 records and forgetting it on the subway, and then those records are considered exposed. That remains a top threat, specifically to healthcare data.\u201d\n\nRansomware will also likely be a key issue, and is something that athenahealth is watching very closely, he added.\n\nHaeni specifically referenced the crypto locker type of ransomware, where an organization\u2019s information is encrypted. To gain access back, the entity is expected to pay a certain amount of money.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re an organization with sensitive data, and you\u2019re not backing it up, your endpoints may potentially get infected this way. We see that as a pretty big threat in 2016.\u201d\n\nFinally, third-party security, or supply chain security, is a critical area for the healthcare industry. The current solution is not working very well, according to Haeni.\n\nRead: Using a \u2018Layered\u2019 Approach for Health Data Security\n\n\u201c[The current solution] is basically that we create these huge checklists and questionnaires and we send it to our fellow security practitioners at these other organizations and ask them to fill it out,\u201d Haeni explained. \u201cAnd every single security conference I go to \u2013 it doesn\u2019t matter whether you\u2019re providing services or consuming services \u2013 everybody seems to understand that it\u2019s not working, but not one knows what else to do.\u201d\n\nWhile athenahealth goes through extensive third-party reviews, and the company ensures that the organizations it contracts with are also put through the same process, Haeni is not sure the industry as a whole is effective and productive.\n\nEstablishing some type of standardization is key, he maintained.\n\n\u201cOne of the problems that we face, as a provider [of services], is we try to standardize that information so that we can easily give it to many different parties. Everybody is facing the same challenge of \u2018Well, we\u2019ve got to do something, but the tools that we\u2019re using just are not that effective.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe questionnaires are often too generic, Haeni added, and the process is not always delivering good outcomes.\n\n\u201cAs security practitioners, we\u2019ve got to claw our way out of that problem.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "EHR security must be a top priority for healthcare organizations, especially as more entities are adopting EHRs.", "author": "HealthITSecurity", "og": {"url": "http://healthitsecurity.com/features/increased-ehr-adoption-raises-need-for-robust-ehr-security", "type": "article", "image": "http://healthitsecurity.com/images/site/features/2016-04-05-hits-ehr-security.jpg", "site_name": "HealthITSecurity", "title": "Increased EHR Adoption Raises Need for Robust EHR Security"}, "twitter": {"description": "EHR security must be a top priority for healthcare organizations, especially as more entities are adopting EHRs.", "title": "Increased EHR Adoption Raises Need for Robust EHR Security", "image": {"src": "http://healthitsecurity.com/images/site/features/2016-04-05-hits-ehr-security.jpg"}, "creator": "@HITAnalytics", "site": "@HITAnalytics", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Protecting against this type of EHR security measure requires healthcare organizations to have a comprehensive data security approach that includes thorough employee training.\nEHR security is one small piece to the larger data security puzzle that healthcare organizations, especially those of a larger size, are becoming increasingly aware of and looking to address.\nHacking incidents, ransomware, and phishing scams could all potentially lead to issues in EHR security.\nRansomware attacks can seriously impact an organization\u2019s EHR security.\nCan we reasonably expect a healthcare organization to defend itself against another country?\u201dA provider can no longer be effective against these kinds of attacks in isolation."}
