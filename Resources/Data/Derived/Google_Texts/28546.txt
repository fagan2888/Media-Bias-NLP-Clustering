BuzzFeed has long pitched to advertisers the power of its technology to make branded content go “viral” among the millions of users who share the site’s quizzes and listicles with their friends. Now, it’s hoping to help advertisers sell products too.

BuzzFeed this week debuted its first foray into e-commerce-enabled branded content with a L’Oreal USA sponsored post that features a click to buy button for readers to purchase the cosmetics and beauty company’s products referenced in the post.

The post “11 Vintage Hairstyles Anyone Can Pull Off,” sponsored by L’Oreal’s Makeup.com, features animated GIFs, tutorial links and Makeup.com illustrations of different types of buns, braids and blowouts for women to try. Below each GIF or illustration is a blue button that says “Love it? Buy It!” that directs readers to a L’Oreal retail page where they can buy the product used to construct that particular hairstyle.

As marketers question if sponsored content is really working, an e-commerce capability can help BuzzFeed better quantify the business impact of sponsored content. BuzzFeed is providing the technology integration but all revenue through the e-commerce test goes to L’Oreal. BuzzFeed said it is too early to share statistics for the L’Oreal partnership yet.

BuzzFeed has been successful in producing and distributing highly viral content: the site attracted about 69 million unique visitors in the U.S. in August, according to comScore, and BuzzFeed says it gets about 75% of its traffic from social media sources. BuzzFeed said it wanted to experiment with whether consumers would use its site to not only read entertaining content but to also buy products for brands they like.

“From an engagement and sharing perspective, beauty tends to do very well,” said BuzzFeed Chief Revenue Officer Andy Wiedlin, adding that the site has found that “how to” and “do it yourself” posts tend to get shared at a higher rate than other pieces of branded content. “If you look at e-commerce consumption, health and beauty are a popular category.”

L’Oreal USA’s Vice President, Digital Innovation, Content and New Ventures Rachel Weiss said the e-commerce integrated posts helps create a more seamless experience for a customer that wants to know how to get a particular look.

“We want to make beauty fun and accessible for everyone and create content that they care about for beauty,” Ms. Weiss said. “BuzzFeed can help us do it at scale like we’ve never done before.”

L’Oreal is BuzzFeed’s first beauty advertiser for the site’s beauty channel in a partnership that runs through February 2015. Other L’Oreal sponsored posts on BuzzFeed include articles such as “Definitive Proof Hairspray Gives You Superpowers” and “15 Signs You Should Be A Makeup Artist” and “10 Items From Our Childhood Closet That Never Went Out Of Style.”

Not all of L’Oreal’s sponsored posts with BuzzFeed will be e-commerce enabled, but BuzzFeed said it will experiment with different types of posts to carry the “Love It? Buy It!” button. There are currently no plans to test the e-commerce capability with other partners, but if it proves to be successful the click to buy button could be extended to other brands, Mr. Wiedlin said.

“We have high confidence that this e-commerce test will work,” Mr. Wiedlin said.
