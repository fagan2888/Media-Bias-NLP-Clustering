The vehicle was painted to look like a Border Patrol SUV. After pulling the car over, the driver was arrested and the agent discovered 12 illegal aliens in the back.\n\nGarza said the 12 illegal aliens stuffed in a Tahoe shows the total disregard for human life these smugglers show towards the people they haul. \u201cIf this vehicle had become involved in a high-speed chase, it could have been catastrophic.\u201d The vehicle was painted to look like a Tahoe regularly used by the U.S. Border Patrol. It did not have any overhead lights normally found on the vehicles. It did; however, have a light bar mounted on the dashboard and the rear view mirror had been removed. It appears the rear seats may have been removed in order to stuff more people into the vehicle.\n\n\u201cThis shows the level of deviousness and desperation these smugglers will stoop to in order to deliver their cargo,\u201d Garza told Breitbart Texas. \u201cThey will not stop. Whether they are smuggling drug, humans or terrorists, to them it is just about the money.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Based on the surprising discovery of one Border Patrol officer, its safe to say human smugglers are getting more cunning by the day..05/26/2016 10:31:34AM EST.", "author": "Leah Barkoukis", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Based on the surprising discovery of one Border Patrol officer, its safe to say human smugglers are getting more cunning by the day.", "title": "Leah Barkoukis - Illegal Aliens Caught in Fake Border Patrol Vehicle", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/leahbarkoukis/2015/12/11/illegal-aliens-caught-in-fake-border-patrol-vehicle-n2092668", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/343/2014-12-09T073305Z_1_LYNXMPEAB80AO_RTROPTP_3_USA-CALIFORNIA-BORDERPATROL.JPG", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Based on the surprising discovery of one Border Patrol officer, its safe to say human smugglers are getting more cunning by the day.", "title": "Leah Barkoukis - Illegal Aliens Caught in Fake Border Patrol Vehicle", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/leahbarkoukis/2015/12/11/illegal-aliens-caught-in-fake-border-patrol-vehicle-n2092668", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/343/2014-12-09T073305Z_1_LYNXMPEAB80AO_RTROPTP_3_USA-CALIFORNIA-BORDERPATROL.JPG", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Illegal Aliens Caught in Fake Border Patrol Vehicle , Leah Barkoukis, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdde17\"", "article_summary": "The vehicle was painted to look like a Border Patrol SUV.\nBased on the surprising discovery of one Border Patrol officer, it\u2019s safe to say human smugglers are getting more cunning by the day.\n\u201cIf this vehicle had become involved in a high-speed chase, it could have been catastrophic.\u201d The vehicle was painted to look like a Tahoe regularly used by the U.S. Border Patrol.\nGarza said the 12 illegal aliens stuffed in a Tahoe shows the total disregard for human life these smugglers show towards the people they haul.\nAfter pulling the car over, the driver was arrested and the agent discovered 12 illegal aliens in the back."}
