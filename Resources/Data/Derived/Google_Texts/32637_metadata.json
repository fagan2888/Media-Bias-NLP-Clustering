Because it\u2019s July, not September, the Broncos are proceeding cautiously. The star pass rusher is not practicing Monday after sitting out the second half of Sunday\u2019s workout.\n\nAs the team ran through drills Monday, Ware stood on the sideline with a white protective sleeve on his bruised right lower leg.\n\nHe is not the only high profile player not working out. All-pro wide receiver Demaryius Thomas did not make the open of practice, though the anticipation remains that he will arrive in Denver on Monday. Thomas was excused from the team\u2019s first four practices after arranging and attending Sunday\u2019s funeral for the grandmother who helped raise him in Georgia.\n\nRegardless, Thomas will not participate in Wednesday\u2019s second open practice at Sports Authority Field at Mile High.\n\nPer the collective bargaining agreement, Thomas must practice three times before putting the pads on. The Broncos are off Tuesday.\n\nOther injured players not participating include: defensive end Greg Latta (knee), tight end Jameson Konz (knee sprain) and John Boyett (stiff back).\n\nPractice began with levity. The Broncos listen to music during stretch and Monday\u2019s opener was \u201cRocky Top.\u201d Peyton Manning, Malik Jackson and Britton Colquitt, former Tennessee stars, danced to the song. When it finished Manning said, \u201cThat\u2019s what I am talking about it. Best practice of the year.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "DeMarcus Ware,Demaryius Thomas,Greg Katta,Jameson Konz,John Boyett,Peyton Manning", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "First-and-Orange", "description": "The Broncos' DeMarcus Ware is not practicing Monday after siting out the second half of Sunday's workout.", "title": "DeMarcus Ware sits out Broncos practice; Demaryius Thomas on way", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2014/07/28/demarcus-sits-leg-bruise-demaryius-thomas-returned-yet/28443/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/files/2014/07/demarcus-ware-denver-broncos.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "The Broncos' DeMarcus Ware is not practicing Monday after siting out the second half of Sunday's workout.", "title": "DeMarcus Ware sits out with leg bruise, Demaryius Thomas has not returned yet", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2014/07/28/demarcus-sits-leg-bruise-demaryius-thomas-returned-yet/28443/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/files/2014/07/demarcus-ware-denver-broncos.jpg", "creator": "@troyrenck", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "language": "en, sv", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "The Broncos' DeMarcus Ware is not practicing Monday after siting out the second half of Sunday's workout."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbbd6\"", "article_summary": "Regardless, Thomas will not participate in Wednesday\u2019s second open practice at Sports Authority Field at Mile High.\nAll-pro wide receiver Demaryius Thomas did not make the open of practice, though the anticipation remains that he will arrive in Denver on Monday.\nOther injured players not participating include: defensive end Greg Latta (knee), tight end Jameson Konz (knee sprain) and John Boyett (stiff back).\nPer the collective bargaining agreement, Thomas must practice three times before putting the pads on.\nThe star pass rusher is not practicing Monday after sitting out the second half of Sunday\u2019s workout."}
