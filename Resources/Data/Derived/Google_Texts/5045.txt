Thursday night marked the start of a new NFL season and in honor of the occasion, NBC’s “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon” had 15 of the League’s biggest names read aloud their comical yearbook-like awards.

In a segment called “NFL Stars Read Their Own Superlatives,” photos of players are matched with high school yearbook-esque quotes about them which they themselves read. Previous versions of this sketch have included NBA All-Stars and the 2015 NHL Stanley Cup Playoffs.

Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski, who played an impactful role in the season opener win against the Pittsburgh Steelers, was simply labeled “Human Minion.”

39-year-old Denver Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning was voted “most likely to have to explain to a rookie what a VCR was,” while New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees won “most likely to be the dad dancing way too hard at a Taylor Swift concert.”
