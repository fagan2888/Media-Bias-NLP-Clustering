Keys III Award.\n\nMeans, over the last year, also facilitated the completion of the Mni Wiconi Rural Water Project.\n\n\u201cMr. Means\u2019 efforts over the past year exemplify his dedication to the Project, bringing high quality drinking water to over 50,000 residents in 10 counties in South Dakota, including the Lower Brule Sioux Tribe, Rosebud Sioux Tribe, the Oglala Sioux Tribe and the West River/Lyman Jones Rural Water System,\u201d said Dakotas Area Office Manager David Rosenkrance.\n\nThe Mni Wiconi Rural Water Project covers more than 12,500 square miles and is one of the geographically largest rural water projects in North America. Means coordinated closely with the Reclamation and the Tribal Council to identify and prioritize project needs once funding was fully appropriated. He worked closely with the EPA and Indian Health Service as well. The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation is the largest wholesale water supplier and second largest producer of hydroelectric power in the United States.\n\n\u201cMr. Means\u2019 efforts always encouraged open discussion and collaborative working relationships to achieve common goals,\u201d said Rosenkrance. \u201cHe led the other Project sponsors, demonstrating that by working together they could achieve far greater results than attempting individual efforts.\u201d\n\nThe John W. Keys III Award is in honor of the late Reclamation Commissioner who lost his life in a plane crash. Keys was well respected and served 36 years in federal departments working on solutions for better management of water resources.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Frank Means, director of the Oglala Sioux Rural Water Supply System, has earned the John W.
