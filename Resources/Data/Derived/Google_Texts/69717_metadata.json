(Photo: Photo: Michael Reynolds, EPA)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Most of Indiana\u2019s lawmakers backed huge tax and spending legislation approved by Congress Friday to avoid a government shutdown before lawmakers left town for the year.\n\nIndiana Sens. Dan Coats, a Republican, and Joe Donnelly, a Democrat, joined the majority of senators Friday in voting 65-33 for the $1.1 trillion catch-all spending bill and $622 billion in tax breaks.\n\n\"Large spending bills inevitably include items that I do not support, but on the whole, this legislation contains many important policy changes that will benefit Hoosiers,\" Coats said.\n\nThe House earlier passed the two pieces separately by solid majorities \u2014 the tax package Thursday and the spending bill Friday morning.\n\nIndiana\u2019s two Democratic House members voted for the spending bill but not the tax package.\n\nIndiana\u2019s seven Republican House members voted for the tax package. All Republicans except Rep. Marlin Stutzman of Howe and Rep. Todd Young of Bloomington supported the spending bill. Both are running for the GOP nomination for Senate.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fiscally irresponsible,\u201d Stutzman said of the bill on his Facebook page.\n\nThe Club for Growth, a conservative group led by former Indiana Rep. David McIntosh, had urged lawmakers to oppose the spending bill, as had other conservative groups.\n\nLawmakers generally viewed the legislation as an imperfect but acceptable compromise between conservative and liberal priorities.\n\n\u201cCongress can now move into 2016 with a fresh start,\u201d said House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis.\n\nThe tax package permanently extends the enhanced child tax credit and earned income tax credit that were boosted by the 2009 economic stimulus, and extends through 2019 a popular corporate tax break that allows companies to more quickly depreciate the value of new equipment.\n\nIt also suspends for two years an excise tax on medical devices that helps pays for expansion of health insurance under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nDonnelly, one of the Democrats from states with a large medical device industry who oppose the tax, said the suspension \u201cwill help spur growth and innovation in Indiana\u2019s life sciences and manufacturing sectors.\u201d\n\nIndiana Republicans also praised other parts of the tax package. But Republicans in general were less enthusiastic about the 2,009-page government funding measure, which combined separate fiscal 2016 spending bills for every federal agency into one massive bill. GOP lawmakers wanted to add provisions blocking Obama's policies on immigration, wetlands rules, armor-piercing bullets and other issues, but those didn't make the final cut.\n\nThe measure does, however, give Republicans a major win by lifting the 40-year ban on crude oil exports.\n\nIt also removes the threat of a government shutdown for the rest of the fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30.\n\nHouse Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., described the spending bill as a major victory for Democrats but said she \"didn't want to advertise it too much\" before Friday's votes for fear Republicans would try to change it\n\nPelosi called the end of the oil export ban \"atrocious policy\" but applauded the extension of tax credits for solar and wind energy projects.\n\nShe said that in exchange for lifting the ban on oil exports, Republicans dropped their demands for defunding Planned Parenthood \u2014 a key GOP goal for much of the fall \u2014 and for blocking Syrian refugees, rolling back gun rules and other issues.\n\n\"I feel almost jubilant about what is in this appropriations bill,\" she said.\n\nSen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, offered fainter praise for the deal, calling it \"the antithesis of perfect.\"\n\n\u201cBut in the end, nothing passes Congress and gets signed into law by the president without some level of bipartisan cooperation and both chambers of Congress working together with the executive branch,\" Cornyn said. \"And this legislation does include several wins for the American people.\u201d\n\nDemocratic leaders labeled the tax package a gift to powerful special interests that isn't paid for, meaning it will add to the federal debt. But they largely embraced the idea of a government funding bill that lasts more than a few weeks or months.\n\n\u201cNo one \u2014 as it never happens \u2014 is going to get everything they want or prevent everything they oppose from being included,\u201d said House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, D-Md. \u201cBusinesses and workers across our country deserve the certainty that comes from ensuring that our government remains open and serving the American people.\u201d\n\nLawmakers seemed motivated to avoid a political meltdown over the budget that would further sour the public\u2019s view of Congress.\n\nThe tax breaks and spending provisions cover everything government does \u2014 and limit how federal money can be spent. For example, the legislation bars Obama from closing the Guantanamo Bay detention facility or spending money on a new facility to house terrorists.\n\nIt also bars the U.S. from implementing the United Nations Arms Trade Treaty. But it does not include provisions barring implementation of Obama's plan to defer deportations for children brought to the U.S. illegally and some of their family members.\n\nThe legislation bars the government from listing the sage grouse as an endangered species, but it does not include Republican-backed provisions to prohibit the Environmental Protection Agency from regulating air emissions related to global climate change.\n\nIt does not prohibit the administration from resettling Syrian refugees in the U.S., as many Republicans and some Democrats had hoped, but it does include new anti-terrorism limits on visitors from 38 countries who can travel to the U.S. without a visa.\n\nThere was plenty to irk opponents of the legislation, especially the decision not to allow amendments.\n\n\u201cThis is a recipe for corruption,\u201d said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. \u201cA handful of people behind closed doors worked, and then 48 hours or whatever before the vote, presented it to us as take it or leave it.\u201d\n\nMcCain complained that the legislation includes money for ships the Navy said it doesn't need, and a huge increase in medical research paid for out of Pentagon funds.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not proud of this. In fact, I\u2019m a bit ashamed,\u201d he said.\n\nContributing: Paul Singer, USA TODAY\n\nRead or Share this story: http://indy.st/1YqRzZV", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Most of Indiana\u2019s lawmakers backed this week huge tax and spending packages needed to avoid a government shutdown.", "og": {"site_name": "Indianapolis Star", "description": "Most of Indiana\u2019s lawmakers backed this week huge tax and spending packages needed to avoid a government shutdown.", "title": "With help from most IN lawmakers, Congress passed spending, tax bill", "url": "http://www.indystar.com/story/news/2015/12/18/help-most-lawmakers-congress-passed-spending-tax-bill/77567732/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/indystar.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Most of Indiana\u2019s lawmakers backed this week huge tax and spending packages needed to avoid a government shutdown.", "title": "With help from most IN lawmakers, Congress passed spending, tax bill", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9002519ee7c62dba2fa0cc0f8761458f65b6282b/c=685-0-3412-2727&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/12/18/Indianapolis/Indianapolis/635860422544445795-Congress.jpg", "creator": "@indystar", "site": "@indystar", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=559965350", "fb": {"app_id": 108716282521686}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Persons/Joe Donnelly", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Persons/Joe Donnelly", "title": "With help from most IN lawmakers, Congress passed spending, tax bill", "author": "Maureen Groppe and Mary Troyan", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b5db74ebd5bdc3f2d606d8917e2167f996ad24c5/c=1688-0-3733-2727/local/-/media/2015/12/18/Indianapolis/Indianapolis/635860422544445795-Congress.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8dee448b5c3234e6c2872549775690d0cdd32bea/c=685-0-3412-2727/local/-/media/2015/12/18/Indianapolis/Indianapolis/635860422544445795-Congress.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/25a09c7a945c0ce3db9ab186cd634eb8f19d3ca9/c=235-0-3862-2727/local/-/media/2015/12/18/Indianapolis/Indianapolis/635860422544445795-Congress.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4e0a9b84d6d6e86cf0c4d5ce1ba7e9342952aba0/c=0-0-4096-2314&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2015/12/18/Indianapolis/Indianapolis/635860422544445795-Congress.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-12-18T20:19:37.277000-05:00", "shorthed": "With IN help, Congress passes spending, tax measures", "articleid": 77567732, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d40669782fdc9874c69e2c25f84d4789de6b93e4/c=0-0-4096-2314/local/-/media/2015/12/18/Indianapolis/Indianapolis/635860422544445795-Congress.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c0f33c8a1da54fa4bbb52c918d3f4f1f913ea55f/c=2200-0-3727-2727/local/-/media/2015/12/18/Indianapolis/Indianapolis/635860422544445795-Congress.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": "Joe Donnelly, Dan Coats, Marlin Stutzman, Todd Young, Congress, Club for Growth, medical device tax, Paul Ryan, Nancy Pelosi, John McCain, Paul Ryan"}, "article_summary": "The House earlier passed the two pieces separately by solid majorities \u2014 the tax package Thursday and the spending bill Friday morning.\nIndiana\u2019s two Democratic House members voted for the spending bill but not the tax package.\n(Photo: Photo: Michael Reynolds, EPA)WASHINGTON \u2014 Most of Indiana\u2019s lawmakers backed huge tax and spending legislation approved by Congress Friday to avoid a government shutdown before lawmakers left town for the year.\nThe Club for Growth, a conservative group led by former Indiana Rep.
