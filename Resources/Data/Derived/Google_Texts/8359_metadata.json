Sign up for a $91 two-month trial subscription today .\n\nThe likelihood CMS will not be able to make good on 100% of the risk corridors payments owed to health plans that lost significant amounts of money on Affordable Care Act (ACA) exchanges in 2014 will create market instability in 2016, a new report by Standard & Poor\u2019s Ratings Services says. Market consultants say the lack of certainty about these payments, from the so-called 3Rs (reinsurance, risk corridors and risk adjustment) risk-mitigation programs under the ACA, will lead plans to hike exchange-based premiums next year as aggressive pricing gives way to the hard realities of the marketplace.\n\nDeep Banerjee, an associate director at Standard & Poor\u2019s and lead author of the report, tells HPW that because of budget neutrality, which requires the risk-corridors pool to be funded by payments insurers make into the pool, there are major shortfalls in store. This is because many insurers are incurring big losses in their exchange business. \u201cOur study indicates that the risk corridor payables are less than 10% of the receivables insurers reported in 2014,\u201d he says.\n\nA receivable refers to the amount a health plan expects to get in payment as a result of the risk corridor. On the other hand, payables are the amount an insurer expects to pay into the corridor pool based on the risk-corridor formula.\n\n3R\u2019s Underfunding Triggers Unease\n\nInsurers do not have to make payments if their risk-corridor ratio (i.e., costs as a share of revenues) is between 97% and 100%, and no payments will be made to insurers if their ratio is between 100% and 103%. But if the risk-corridor ratio falls between 92% and 97%, the health plan will pay into the corridor 50% of the excess. If the ratio is below 92%, the plan will pay about 80% of the excess into the corridor. These amounts will then be paid out in similar proportion to plans between 103% and 107% and to those at above 107%. CMS is likely to announce these risk-corridor payments in late June.\n\nBanerjee says larger insurers will be able to take any lost receivables under the risk-corridor program (see table, below) in stride, but smaller players with a larger proportion of their business tied to ACA exchanges will experience a tougher hit. And for all insurers, the fact CMS may be unable to fulfill the promise of the risk-mitigation programs is a wake-up call. \u201cThe reinsurance and risk-corridor programs are temporary [expiring at the end of 2016], and after they are gone eventually rational pricing will have to come back to the market,\u201d he says. \u201cWith the programs, however, you can afford to be a little aggressive in your pricing to pick up members and grow scale, but once these programs are gone, you probably have to price more conservatively than now.\u201d\n\nChristopher Condeluci, a principal at CC Law & Policy, tells HPW that 2016 premium increases are in store because of this rethinking by insurers on their individual-market pricing due to the uncertainties of 3R payments. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be a sky is falling type of person, but more new entrants may exit because they cannot cope, unlike the big guys. And separately, you are going to have a premium spike by those new entrants that are still able to see if they can weather the storm, and the big guys will still charge higher premiums,\u201d he says.\n\nThis interplay between insurer pricing strategies in the new public exchanges and expectations for risk- mitigation payments is a factor in all markets. But Humana Inc.\u2019s experience in the Georgia individual market, where the carrier has admitted to pricing problems, is to brokers that operate in the state a prime example of this phenomenon.\n\nACA exchanges were virgin territory for insurers when they opened for business about a year and a half ago. And in some cases, like Humana in Georgia, and in a much more drastic way for smaller insurers like the failed CoOportunity Health, Inc. in Iowa and Nebraska (HPW 1/12/15, p. 1), the purpose of the safety net offered by the 3Rs has become especially important because of mistakes in setting premiums for individual policies.\n\nExecutives of Humana, which is best known for its major presence in the Medicare market, spoke on April 29 during a first-quarter 2015 earnings conference call about how Georgia\u2019s individual market has hurt the bottom line of its Humana One individual plan offering.\n\nHumana CEO Bruce Broussard, on the earnings call, told investors that even as Humana One membership has grown nationally, and continues to be a break-even business, the insurer projects an increased reliance on the 3Rs. Humana Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Brian Kane said the ACA exchange business is akin to what a startup deals with, and that has meant some successes and some stumbles.\n\nAs a result, he said, \u201cWe have increased our net 2015 3R guidance range to $450 million to $550 million with reinsurance accounting for approximately 75% and risk adjustment and risk corridors accounting for approximately 25% of the total. As we have discussed in the past, there is an interplay between risk adjustment and risk corridors in that if we don\u2019t get the risk adjustment exactly right, a meaningful part of the balance, either positive or negative, is captured through the risk corridors.\u201d\n\nKane said that in Georgia the insurer\u2019s limited claims experience and an unexpected \u201cless healthy state population\u201d resulted in Humana accruing both a risk-adjustment and risk-corridor receivable. But this trial and error for the start of ACA exchanges is exactly the point of the premium stabilization programs, \u201cnamely early-year protection in this circumstance,\u201d he added.\n\nBrokers Detail Humana Pricing Strategies\n\nEarly protection or not, Rick Bailey, president of insurance brokers Rick Bailey & Company, Inc., based in Woodstock, Ga., tells HPW it seems Humana simply overplayed a low pricing move it undertook for open enrollment for 2014. \u201cThey came out with some very aggressive pricing last year for their first exchange open enrollment. And they were killing it. They were so much lower than everybody,\u201d he says. \u201cFor this year, we kind of expected a price correction from them and someone else to come in and take them on, but it really didn\u2019t happen. Humana\u2019s pricing is still underneath everybody in metro Atlanta again for a second year. I was kind of shocked on how they could do that. My guess is maybe they have been aggressive in pricing in thinking the money from government for the first three years would help offset that.\u201d\n\nConcurring with Bailey is Russ Childers, an insurance agent based in Americus, Ga., and past president of the Georgia Association of Health Underwriters. He tells HPW that Humana priced \u201creal low in the market\u201d for the first year of exchanges, offering plans in major metro areas centered in north Georgia (Atlanta), with exceptions made for Savannah and Macon. \u201cThey were significantly lower than anyone else for 2014, probably 10% to 15% under Blue Cross [Anthem, Inc.\u2019s Blue Cross Blue Shield of Georgia], the primary competition. Their idea was to secure market share,\u201d he says.\n\nFor Childers, this extremely low pricing strategy struck him as a \u201clittle strange,\u201d given the inevitable in the health plan world, which is that enrollees likely will be filing plenty of claims at some point. Now, from what he saw for 2015, Humana did adjust its pricing, raising premiums on the order of 10% on average. But other carriers adjusted as well, like the Blues plan, which did the opposite and reduced premiums. \u201cAnd United [UnitedHealth Group unit UnitedHealthcare] entered at about the same price point as Blue Cross,\u201d Childers adds.\n\nHe says that he thinks the way Humana started off in 2014, with its aggressive approach, made other large carriers nervous and resulted in the twitches by Aetna Inc. and UnitedHealth that saw both carriers file to enter the Georgia exchange but then withdraw.\n\nHumana had no comment on the Georgia market.\n\nInsurers With the Highest Risk-Corridor Receivables in 2014\n\nInsurer State of domicile Net ACA risk-corridor receivables (mil. $) ACA corridor receivables as % of reported capital Health Care Service Corp.
