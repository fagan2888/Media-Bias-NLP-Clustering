(George Lange)\n\nAfter she joined Donald Trump\u2019s real estate business, Louise Sunshine struggled to maintain a steady weight while managing her new career alongside the busy schedules of three young children.\n\nTrump must have noticed, Sun\u00adshine said. She recalled that he kept an unflattering photograph of her in a drawer \u2014 a \u201cfat picture,\u201d as she called it \u2014 that he would pull out when she did something he didn\u2019t like.\n\nIt was \u201ca reminder that I wasn\u2019t perfect,\u201d said Sunshine, who worked with Trump for 15 years starting in the mid-1970s when he set about remaking Manhattan\u2019s skyline. \u201cHe just is that way.\u201d\n\nSunshine said she bears no grudges and instead considers Trump a valued mentor. A political fundraiser with no prior real estate expertise, Sunshine ascended to executive vice president of the Trump Organization, joining a cadre of female executives who have played central roles in Trump\u2019s empire.\n\nTrump called Sunshine\u2019s account of the photograph \u201ctotally false and ridiculous,\u201d but her feelings illustrate a paradox about the Republican front-runner.\n\nLouise Sunshine with Donald Trump, left, and President Jimmy Carter.

(Photo Courtesy of Louise Sunshine)\n\nIn the five months that the billionaire businessman has spent on the presidential campaign trail, his inflammatory missiles toward women have prompted charges of sexism, even misogyny. His obsession with physical appearance \u2014 such as speculating that Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton was wearing a wig \u2014 drew charges of bullying from the candidate vying to be the country\u2019s first female president. Polls show Trump suffering from a wider gender gap among American voters overall than other Republican candidates.\n\nBut many women who have worked closely with Trump say he was a corporate executive ahead of his time in providing career advancement for women. While some say he could be boorish, his companies nurtured and pro\u00admoted women in an otherwise male-dominated industry. Several women said they appreciated how Trump granted them entry to a new playing field.\n\n\u201cFrom the standpoint of being a woman, I just thought he was phenomenal,\u201d said Sunshine, 74. \u201cSo supportive and encouraging. . . . He gave me the ropes, and I could either hang myself or prove myself.\u201d\n\nJennifer Crisafulli-Oberting, 43, a contestant on the Trump reality TV show \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d who went on to promote the show in media appearances with Trump, said she felt she was being welcomed into the \u201cboys\u2019 club\u201d \u2014 but on her terms.\n\n\u201cYou were like one of the guys right off the bat, but you didn\u2019t have to act or dress like one of the guys,\u201d she said.\n\nTrump often told the women he employed and worked with that he valued those he believed would stand their ground on construction sites and in legal battles. He called Barbara Res, whom he put in charge of the construction of his now-iconic Trump Tower in 1980, \u201ca killer,\u201d she recalled. And he used to tell her and others that \u201cmen are better than women, but a good woman is better than 10 good men.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t discriminatory against women that I saw,\u201d said Res, now in her 60s and owner of a construction consultancy.\n\nDonald Trump dedicated a \u201cTrump the Game\u201d set to Louise Sunshine, a real estate developer who worked for the billionarie businessman. (Angel Valentin/For The Washington Post)\n\nRes said Trump was \u201cbrave\u201d to hire her when few women were in the business. But like many men of the era, she said, \u201che was sexist; he made comments and stuff like that.\u201d\n\nIn an interview, Trump blamed perceptions of him as sexist on unfair media coverage of his presidential campaign.\n\n\u201cI have been very, very good for women,\u201d he said. \u201cI was way ahead of the curve.\u201d\n\nTrump highlighted the role of women in his corporate success in his 1987 book \u201cThe Art of the Deal,\u201d writing that he hired \u201ca lot of women for top jobs, and they\u2019re among my best people.\u201d\n\nReferring in the interview to his recruitment and promotion of women, he added: \u201cIt was a good decision. Good for women and good for me.\u201d\n\nToday, according to Trump\u2019s attorney, Michael Cohen, there are more women than men holding executive positions in the Trump Organization, heading such departments as human resources, golf and hotel management, and global licensing, even though women make up just 43 percent of the overall workforce. Women who are in similar positions as men, Cohen said, \u201care compensated at equal and in many cases higher pay rates.\u201d\n\nIt was not possible to independently verify Cohen\u2019s data, and he declined to provide documentation.\n\nThe picture many current and former employees paint stands in contrast to the blustering controversies prompted by Trump\u2019s comments since he hit the campaign trail. In an interview after the first Republican debate, when Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly grilled Trump about calling women \u201cfat pigs,\u201d \u201cdogs,\u201d \u201cslobs\u201d and \u201cdisgusting animals,\u201d Trump said Kelly had \u201cblood coming out of her wherever.\u201d He mocked the appearance of his only female rival for the nomination, Carly Fiorina, referring in a Rolling Stone interview to her face and asking, \u201cWould anyone vote for that?\u201d His attempt to make amends by saying of Fiorina, \u201cI think she\u2019s got a beautiful face,\u201d struck many as demeaning.\n\nAsked in an interview about his comments about Kelly and Fiorina, Trump said: \u201cThey can take care of themselves. They are capable of taking care of themselves.\u201d He also insisted that he does not discriminate. \u201cI treat men and women in a very similar fashion,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump has not reserved his critiques of appearances to women. He said recently that his hair was better than that of rival Marco Rubio. And he achieved a back-handed jab at Rand Paul during a recent debate by saying, \u201cI never attacked him on his look, and believe me, there\u2019s plenty of subject matter right there.\u201d\n\nAt times, it seems Trump can\u2019t help himself. Midway through a telephone interview about his treatment of women, he told a Washington Post reporter, \u201cYou\u2019re a very beautiful woman, as I understand it.\u201d\n\nThe presence of striking women has played a key role in Trump\u2019s relentless quest to boost his brand \u2014 in real estate, in entertainment and now in politics.\n\nIn 1989, Savvy Woman magazine ran a cover story featuring Trump with Res and two other women on his team with the text \u201cSurprise! Mr. Macho\u2019s Inner Circle Isn\u2019t An All-Boys\u2019 Club.\u201d The cover at once burnished the image of an alpha male and suggested the modern sensibilities of a gender-neutral employer.\n\nAfter \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d debuted in 2004, Trump\u2019s many \u00admedia appearances with shapely beauties helped goose the show\u2019s phenomenal ratings. Crisafulli-Oberting remembered participating in a shoot for People\u2019s 2004 Sexiest Man Alive issue in which she and five other women appeared in a barbershop scene combing Trump\u2019s hair and shining his shoes. A quote from Trump, then 58, reads, \u201cThese are special women, so if they think I\u2019m sexy, that\u2019s OK with me.\u201d\n\nNow, in his political life, Trump relies on a former model, 27-year-old Hope Hicks, to run his PR.\n\nHis glamorous daughter Ivanka \u2014 about whom he once said, \u201cIf Ivanka weren\u2019t my daughter, perhaps, I would be dating her\u201d \u2014 introduced Trump when he announced his presidential bid. Ivanka, 34 and pregnant with her third child, navigates a thoroughly modern path between motherhood, real estate development and promoting her line of jewelry and clothing. She is developing a Lean In-style \u201cWomen Who Work\u201d initiative and in recent weeks has taken to the airwaves to combat the furor her father\u2019s comments provoked.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that he\u2019s gender-targeted at all,\u201d Ivanka Trump told CNN. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be a high-level executive within his organization if he felt that way.\u201d\n\nThose who have worked for Trump say looks aren\u2019t everything. He is more interested in hiring smart people, regardless of gender, they say, and that has led Trump for decades to rely on strong, assertive women both as gatekeepers and as advisers.\n\nNorma Foerderer, for instance, spent two decades as a personal assistant to Trump, advising him on everything \u201cfrom what color tie to wear to whether or not he should purchase a building,\u201d according to Jim Dowd, who used to represent Trump at his PR company. Foerderer, who rose to vice president, retired in 2006 and died two years ago.\n\nRhona Graff, Trump\u2019s current assistant and a senior vice president, has been with him for more than 25 years. Graff, who regularly appeared in \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d gained some notice recently after a super PAC backing Trump used contact information that came from her to solicit a donation, according to an e-mail obtained by The Post. Graff declined to be interviewed for this article, but she sent an e-mail in which she described a stimulating position in which two days were never alike working for a man who is at once demanding and \u201cbrilliant, insightful, funny, charismatic and surprisingly down to earth.\u201d\n\nSeveral of Trump\u2019s female employees said he fostered a positive work environment.\n\nDeirdre Rosen, 42, vice president of human resources for the Trump Hotel Collection, said that after working for big public companies, the seven years she has spent at the family-run Trump Organization have offered her the flexibility to \u201cbe present at soccer games and drama club\u201d with her children.\n\nJill Martin, 35, assistant general counsel, who joined the Trump Organization five years ago, described a boss who helped her overcome her caution about her abilities and encouraged her to grow. When a case went before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, she said, Trump could have asked a more experienced male lawyer to argue the case. Instead, \u201cHe said, \u2018Jill, you\u2019ll do great,\u2019 \u201d she recalled. \u201cHe pushed me when I needed it.\u201d\n\nBut several women who are longtime Trump supporters say the provocative outbursts that served Trump well in business and entertainment don\u2019t belong in politics. \u201cI don\u2019t like the fact the worlds are merging,\u201d said Ereka Vetrini, a TV host and lifestyle expert.\n\nVetrini, who appeared with other female \u201cApprentice\u201d contestants in a controversial TV Guide cover (\u201ctummies bare, ties on\u201d), said she understood the impetus to boost ratings for Trump\u2019s show, but political polls are a different matter.\n\n\u201cFiorina and Kelly?\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t disregard those comments.\u201d\n\nNor can Res, who also disagrees with her former boss\u2019s political stance: From his antiabortion position to his opposition to the Affordable Care Act, \u201chis policies, the things he says he believes in, are very anti-women.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m voting for Hillary,\u201d Res said.\n\nDespite what she says is outrageous language, Sunshine said she supports Trump in his bid to be president.\n\nAnd the \u201cfat picture\u201d?\n\nShe hasn\u2019t forgotten it, Sunshine said. \u201cWhen I gain weight, I think of that picture,\u201d she reflected, evoking a Pavlovian image of her former boss using the photograph as a trigger to condition her behavior.\n\nLooking back, she said, \u201cit was quite a good idea.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Donald Trump, president, louise sunshine, potus, republican presidential race, gop race, campaign trail, frances sellers, frances stead sellers, @francesssellers", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The GOP front-runner has been accused of sexism, but the business mogul promoted female executives in a male-dominated industry.", "title": "Donald Trump, a champion of women?
