A local food bank is teaming up with an international retail business to fight hunger.

The Bay Area Food Bank and Walmart are kicking off their 2nd Annual "Defeat Hunger Bowl," an effort to collect food donations and raise awareness for those struggling with hunger in Florida.

Until February 8th you can stop in any of the 20 participating Walmart stores in the Panhandle and donate non-perishable food items or pre-packaged food donation bags.

"We have seen some great support in this community. It's definitely a community where everyone is looking out for each other. It's so important because a lot of times the people who are in need, you may not know it, it could be your neighbor. It's really imporant to help others out and we have seen great support in Panama City," said Colleen McMahon, External Relations Manager for Bay Area Food Bank

All donations go directly to Bay Area Food Banks and the pantries and soup kitchens they support.
