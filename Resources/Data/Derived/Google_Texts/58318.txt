ThinkingPhones Adds Data Integration Business Contactive

The acquisition follows software deals from DataStax and MyECheck

ThinkingPhones has acquired Contactive, a technology company that helps link people and businesses to create online identities.

New York-based Contactive pulls information from social media, publicly-available sources and the company's global directory to provide caller ID information through a product called Klink. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.

ThinkingPhones, headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts, develops software that moves users' voice, video, text and other mobile applications onto the cloud. The buyer has almost $88 million in venture capital backing from Bessemer Venture Partners, Technology Crossover Ventures and Advanced Technology Ventures. ThinkingPhones made another acquisition, Portsmouth, New Hampshire integration technology company Whaleback Managed Services, in August.

The acquisition will allow ThinkingPhones to integrate Klink into its offerings. "Since most employees already Google people or businesses to read more about them on LinkedIn, Twitter, or Yelp, it only makes sense that smartphones should do that work in real-Â­time for every incoming call in the enterprise setting," says ThinkingPhones CEO Steve Kokinos.

Other recent software deals include DataStax Inc.'s acquisition of Aurelis, a Seattle-based database business, and MyECheck's deal for Seergate, in January.
