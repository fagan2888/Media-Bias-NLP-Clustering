According to the latest Washington Post-ABC News poll, just 43 percent of Americans approve of the job he\u2019s doing\u2014down 9 percentage points from the same time last year. In polls comparing confidence in Obama to confidence in congressional Republicans, the president has lost ground with the public on every measure since last year\u2014from his handling of the economy to protecting the middle class.\n\nThe dismal numbers are a reflection of a rocky year. From still-sluggish job growth to Edward Snowden\u2019s revelations about the National Security Agency\u2019s spying on Americans to the partial government shutdown to the botched rollout of HealthCare.gov, little seems to have gone right for the White House in 2013.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nAt least, that\u2019s one way to look at Obama\u2019s second-term woes. Another possibility is that there\u2019s just something about Year Five itself\u2014some immutable law of the American political calendar that condemns our presidents to a miserable time after their second inaugural. Maybe it\u2019s about presidents and their re-election hangovers, or their opponents\u2019 renewed determination to thwart the White House agenda, or perhaps it\u2019s simply the problem of the public\u2019s inevitable fatigue. What\u2019s clear is that, while the causes may differ, Obama is by no means alone in his fifth-year flop.\n\nWe asked a panel of distinguished historians to tell us which American presidents also had rough starts to their second terms, and their responses are a reminder that West Wing misery has plenty of company: Many presidents, even some of our most fondly remembered, have suffered from disastrous fifth years.\n\n***\n\nH.W. Brands: F.D. Roosevelt\n\nIn 1937, the greatest president of the twentieth century suffered the worst fifth year in presidential history. Franklin Delano Roosevelt\u2019s effort to reform the Supreme Court was denounced as \u201ccourt-packing\u201d and cost him nearly all the momentum he had gained in his huge reelection victory. And then the economy tanked, undoing most of the progress that had been made against the Great Depression. The Roosevelt magic was gone; even Democrats began turning against him. If World War II hadn\u2019t given him another chance, he would be remembered today as a mediocre president at best.\n\nJean Edward Smith: F.D. Roosevelt\n\nWith the exception of Lincoln, FDR had the worst fifth year of any American president. And it was all self-inflicted. He began by attempting to pack the Supreme Court. Roosevelt wanted to appoint a new justice for every justice who was 70 and had not retired. That would have given him six additional appointments. It was overreach.\n\nThen Sen. Taylor Robinson, the majority leader, died in the middle of the fight, and Roosevelt did not attend his funeral in Arkansas. That further alienated the Senate. Finally, FDR thought the Depression was over and cut the federal budget drastically. That precipitated the economic downturn in 1938 and 1939. If war had not come, FDR would have been a two-term president. And he would have been ranked good, not great.\n\nPeter Hahn: Richard Nixon\n\nArguably, Richard Nixon experienced the bumpiest \u201cyear five\u201d in recent history. Nixon triumphed in the 1972 presidential election by huge margins, collecting 60.7 percent of the popular vote and gathering 520 electoral votes to his opponent\u2019s 17. And in January-February 1973, he officially ended the Vietnam War and welcomed home American POWs. By the end of 1973, by contrast, the Arab-Israeli October War escalated international tensions, provoking a military alert and undermining the d\u00e9tente policy that Nixon had championed. At home, the Watergate scandal\u2014which resulted in resignations, criminal convictions, congressional and press inquiries, and the \u201cSaturday Night Massacre\u201d\u2014together with the forced resignation of Vice President Spiro Agnew placed Nixon on a fast track to a disgraceful, premature exit from the White House.\n\nJames Goldgeier: Richard Nixon and others\n\nThe gold standard for a rough first year of a modern second presidential term belongs to Richard Nixon in 1973, as Watergate burst into the nation\u2019s consciousness. The Affordable Care Act enrollment rollout does not come close. Other modern presidents have gotten into deep trouble in their second terms\u2014Ronald Reagan with the Iran-Contra affair and Bill Clinton with the Monica Lewinsky scandal. At the conclusion of Year One of his second term, while his aides grapple with his dismal approval ratings, Barack Obama no longer faces the threat of another imminent government shutdown, thanks to the budget agreement in Congress, and his administration has opened the possibility for a nuclear deal with Iran\u2014participating in the highest-level talks between the two countries in nearly four decades. All in all, it could be a lot worse.\n\nJack Rakove: James Madison\n\nFew presidents have had a worse fifth year than James Madison, when the United States went from one reverse to another in the War of 1812. Most critics treat his conduct of the war as a low mark in the history of the presidency. The New England states sat the war out, and even mused about secession. Yet Madison left the presidency in 1817 a popular leader, buoyed not only by the patriotism that flourished after the war, but by the widely held belief that he had acted as a republican president should, holding to the constitutional principles he did so much to establish. Perhaps there is a deeper lesson in his presidency we should all contemplate.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO Magazine", "description": "Was it Obama?
