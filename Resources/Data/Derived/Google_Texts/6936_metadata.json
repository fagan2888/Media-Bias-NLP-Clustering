Created to deliver the final word on the long-running saga, the committee headed by Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-SC), a former prosecutor, has the funding, the jurisdiction and the subpoena power that lawmakers said would be necessary to bring an end to the debate over what happened in Libya in 2012.\n\nRelated: With Credibility Slipping, Clinton Pushes Back on Benghazi Probe\n\nHowever, in an interview with his hometown Greenville News, Gowdy over the weekend set out to lower expectations. Turns out that millions of dollars and thousands of person-hours of work don\u2019t necessarily buy you a whole lot of certainty.\n\n\u201cIf you do a good enough job laying out the facts, the conclusions will either speak for themselves or you\u2019ll have competing factual narratives and you can draw your own conclusions,\u201d Gowdy told the paper.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not my job to tell people what to conclude,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you have two witnesses, [and] one says the light was red and one green, I don\u2019t view myself as being the arbiter of who is more credible.\u201d\n\nIn the end, he said, \u201cPeople are going to draw different conclusions. That\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\nRelated: Forget Benghazi \u2013 Blame Hillary for the Disastrous Russian Reset\n\nIn a way, Gowdy was making a somewhat pedantic point about the nature of any investigation. It will always, of course, be possible for people to challenge, or even deny, facts that don\u2019t fit their preferred version of events.\n\nBut when the combined cost of the multiple investigations into the Benghazi attacks gets calculated \u2013 and it will \u2013 plenty of people, chief among them congressional Democrats, aren\u2019t going to be pleased with an \u201cone the one hand, one the other hand\u201d conclusions. They long ago concluded that the Benghazi investigations are chiefly political in nature, meant to raise doubts about Democratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton, who was secretary of state at the time of the attacks.\n\nEarlier this month, for example, Gowdy released a one-year progress report on the investigation. Among other things, he announced that the committee will not call Clinton to testify until it is satisfied that it has received all of the necessary information from the State Department. Gowdy also hinted that the investigation would likely not be concluded until 2016 \u2013 the year of the next presidential election.\n\n\u201cAt every turn, the Select Committee comes up with a new excuse to further delay its work and then blames its glacial pace on someone else,\u201d said Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD), the committee\u2019s top Democrat. \u201cRepublicans are desperately trying to validate the $3 million in taxpayer funds they have spent over the past year, but they have nothing to show for it other than a partisan attack against Secretary Clinton and her campaign for president.\u201d\n\nRelated: Hillary Alert: New Emails Mean Benghazi Isn\u2019t Over\n\nAdam Smith (D-WA), the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said: \u201cThe Republican Progress update and admission that the final report won\u2019t be made public until 2016 begs the question: What have we spent $3 million dollars on? Their lack of any real progress makes clear that this Committee\u2019s goal isn\u2019t a legitimate investigation \u2013 it\u2019s a $3 million dollar publically financed political attack committee.\u201d\n\nThe $3 million price tag on the Select Committee\u2019s investigation is, of course, only the beginning.\n\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation has been investigating the attack from the start, and its work is ongoing.\n\nOther congressional investigations have been undertaken by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Government Reform and no fewer than five separate House committees (Armed Services, Foreign Affairs, Judiciary, Intelligence, and Oversight and Government Reform.)\n\nRelated: How Hillary\u2019s Email Mess Revived Benghazi\n\nThere is currently no good data on the total amount spent investigating Benghazi. But at its current rate, the House Select Committee will likely spend some $6 million by next year, and the multiple other congressional investigations likely spent similar sums. That doesn\u2019t take into account the costs incurred by other government agencies in connection with the investigations. Last year, for example, the Pentagon reported that it had spent millions of dollars on complying with repetitive requests for information from the multiple investigating committees.\n\nWhen Gowdy wraps things up in 2016, he may think it\u2019s \u201cfine\u201d to deliver a finding that doesn\u2019t claim to finally put the questions about Benghazi to rest. But it\u2019s not clear taxpayers will agree.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "When it comes to investigating the Benghazi attacks, it turns out that millions of dollars and tens of thousands of person-hours of work don\u2019t necessarily buy you a whole lot of certainty.", "title": "Millions Spent on Benghazi Probes with No Answers in Sight", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/05/19/Millions-Spent-Benghazi-Probes-No-Answers-Sight", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/wpid-2012-12-20T163138Z_3_CBRE8BJ02AF00_RTROPTP_2_USA-BENGHAZI-CLINTON.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/05/19/Millions-Spent-Benghazi-Probes-No-Answers-Sight", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/wpid-2012-12-20T163138Z_3_CBRE8BJ02AF00_RTROPTP_2_USA-BENGHAZI-CLINTON.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@rrgarver"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "When it comes to investigating the Benghazi attacks, it turns out that millions of dollars and tens of thousands of person-hours of work don\u2019t necessarily buy you a whole lot of certainty.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The House Select Committee on Benghazi was supposed to change that.\nRelated: How Hillary\u2019s Email Mess Revived BenghaziThere is currently no good data on the total amount spent investigating Benghazi.\nThey long ago concluded that the Benghazi investigations are chiefly political in nature, meant to raise doubts about Democratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton, who was secretary of state at the time of the attacks.\nTurns out that millions of dollars and thousands of person-hours of work don\u2019t necessarily buy you a whole lot of certainty.\nLast year, for example, the Pentagon reported that it had spent millions of dollars on complying with repetitive requests for information from the multiple investigating committees."}
