Late-night television came back Monday after a holiday break to catch up on stories the shows missed over the last two weeks. Late Show's Stephen Colbert looked at Jeb Bush's campaign punctuation and The Daily Show's Trevor Noah joked about Ben Carson's campaign shakeup, suggesting Carson's former communications director wasn't doing a great job anyway.

Donald Trump starts 2016 leading the GOP field and late-night continues to take note. Conan O'Brien joked about Trump's new TV ad, while The Tonight Show's Jimmy Fallon looked at some things Trump said about Ted Cruz. Late Night's Seth Meyers highlighted a few Trump notes, keying in on comments Trump made at a rally about the true value of a losing campaign.
