It would be like shooting fish in a barrel.\n\nJerry Azzaro, San Francisco\n\nKudos for naming names\n\nCongratulations to Robert Reich for calling out, by name, a number of the rich, right-wing egomaniacs who want to take over America, a goal that some of them have stated publicly.\n\nLet Americans beware of them and the puppet politicians who front for them.\n\nSteve Gregory, Kentfield\n\nHouse GOP deaf to public\n\nThe hearing aid industry should contact House members about tests and aids immediately. They obviously are not hearing the public, selectively hearing only the Limbaugh short-circuit and Tea Party conservatives, about 5 percent of the public at best.\n\nExcellent articles by John Diaz (\"California's cautionary tale\") and Robert Reich (\"Time to push back against GOP's right-wing bullies\") in Insight on Oct. 6 lay out the abyss that these Republicans have dug for themselves.\n\nIn 2010, when President Obama and speaker John Boehner had a deal, Boehner couldn't deliver. Why should Obama talk to Boehner? Boehner and the House Republicans have no clout, no spine and no chance to deliver a deal or win any seats in 2014.\n\nJohn Hopper, Walnut Creek\n\nRepublican behavior is treason\n\nLike petulant children, congressional Republicans shut down the government because they don't like Obamacare. More to the point, they don't like Obama.\n\nObamacare is primarily a Republican program, modeled after the Massachusetts program signed into law by Mitt Romney. It provides health insurance to all through private insurance companies.\n\nWhen bringing the Affordable Care Act into law, Obama compromised wholeheartedly with Republicans; he even abandoned the key element, a single-payer public option.\n\nThe Republicans who want to destroy Obamacare by shutting down our federal government are saying \"Obama needs to compromise.\" Our democracy cannot yield to terrorists within the halls of Congress who want to destroy our system of government.\n\nIf Republicans wanted to fix Obamacare, they could pass a specific bill to fix it. They tried 42 times to kill Obamacare and failed. Now they are attacking our governmental budget and national economy. It's treason.\n\nBruce Joffe, Piedmont\n\nTribute to Nobel winners\n\nLet us all pay tribute to the nine winners of the Nobel Prize in physics, chemistry and medicine, three of whom are here - two at Stanford, one at UC Berkeley.\n\nThese brilliant scientists have advanced our knowledge of complicated processes in nature, chemistry and medicine that have already brought tangible benefits.\n\nThomas Letchfield, Palo Alto\n\nPacific Heights all about the 1%\n\nPacific Heights (\"Rarefied air,\" Oct. 2)? An example of how San Francisco's \"leading families\" \"give back\" on behalf of a \"committed elite\"? Seriously?\n\nPacific Heights is and has always been a bastion of the 1 percent, most of whom could not care less about the 99 percent from whom they make their millions.\n\nThis article was truly shocking, putting the \"sick\" in sycophantic. In fact, Pacific Heights is full of people who make their money by exporting jobs to Singapore, Bangladesh or wherever workers are paid little and treated worse. These \"elite\" fabricate the clothing and computer products they sell anywhere the labor is cheapest and the environmental regulations are weakest.\n\nSure, these people have helped create and improve Crissy Field, the Presidio and other beautiful public spaces.\n\nBut they make sure their money stays near their neighborhoods. What big Pacific Heights projects help anyone or anyplace south of Cesar Chavez, in the Bayview or Outer Mission? Many people in the city can't even afford to feed their children.\n\nIn this period of increasing and unprecedented class inequality in the U.S. -and S.F. - this article is at the least inexplicable.\n\nEmily Robertson, Berkeley", "article_metadata": {"SKYPE_TOOLBAR": "SKYPE_TOOLBAR_PARSER_COMPATIBLE", "description": "House GOP deaf to publicThe hearing aid industry should contact House members about tests and aids immediately.
