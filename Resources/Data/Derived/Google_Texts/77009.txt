Former Aetna Chairman and CEO Ron Williams weighs in on the UnitedHealth move to flirt with the idea of ditching Obamacare.

Former Aetna CEO Ron Williams told CNBC's "Closing Bell" negative margins can be attributed to an imbalance in the customer mix.

"In the individual insurance market, maintaining affordability requires you have a mix of members in that insurance pool," Williams said. "Where we stand now, because of some of these special enrollment periods, is we have a mix imbalance; we have more people who need healthcare today and fewer who are making a decision to purchase the insurance before they need the healthcare."

Smolinski says the problem needs to be addressed by the Obama administration and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

"I think it really is a wake-up call to HHS, to the White House to say, 'Look, these people are more sick, they're more expensive.' There are people coming onto the exchanges, maybe obtaining coverage for three, four months and dropping out," she said. She says the government should check those users out more thoroughly and assess penalties where needed.
