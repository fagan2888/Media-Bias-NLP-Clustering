Her name is Lucy, and she\u2019s one and a half years old now.\n\nWhen I first got married, my wife said, \u201cLet\u2019s get a dog.\u201d She prevailed, and I absolutely fell in love with our dog, Aggie. She passed away last year. I took being a dog parent very seriously. One of the tactics they say to establish pack hierarchy is put your puppy down in the woods and walk away, and they\u2019ll know you\u2019re the leader and start following you. She followed right after me, and there was a bond ever since then.\n\n+ Scenthound Owner Tim Vogel poses for a photo at the company\u2019s Jupiter office. The dog care club provides monthly bathing, ear-cleaning, ... read more \u00d7\n\nQ: How is Scenthound different from other dog grooming places?\n\nA: We really call it a monthly care club. Grooming is really about health and preventative maintenance, not just the haircuts.\n\nThere were so many times I was walking around my neighborhood, and I\u2019d meet someone with their dog. I was like, \u201cOh, I own a grooming shop.\u201d They\u2019d say, \u201cThat\u2019s great. My dog doesn\u2019t need grooming,\u201d but you\u2019d smell the ear infection, or you could smell their breath from the periodontal disease.\n\nThat\u2019s when it dawned on me. We need to make this fast, easy and affordable.\n\nQ: What\u2019s the secret to brushing a fussy dog\u2019s teeth or trimming his or her nails?\n\nA: The relationship you have with your dog. When you get your dog, you need to really start playing with their feet, their ears, actually letting them put your fingers in their mouth \u2014 allowing you to touch them anywhere.\n\nQ: Speaking of tooth-brushing, where did you get this idea to set a world record for most people brushing dogs\u2019 teeth simultaneously?\n\nA: Dental care is one of the most important and overlooked issues in the dog care industry. If you cared for your dog\u2019s teeth on a regular basis, you could potentially extend your dog\u2019s life by three or four years. It\u2019s really just an area that needs to be brought into the light to help people care for their dogs better.\n\nQ: What\u2019s your favorite place to take your dog in Palm Beach County?\n\nA: One of the reasons we do a lot of work with Friends of Jupiter Beach is because we go there every week. That is hands down my favorite place to take our dog.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Scenthound owner Tim Vogel is recruiting dog parents to bring their pup to Downtown at the Gardens on April 3.", "author": "By Sarah Peters - Palm Beach Post Staff Writer", "og": {"url": "http://www.mypalmbeachpost.com/news/news/local/jupiter-mans-quest-for-dog-dental-care-inspires-wo/nqpH3/", "image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/img/photos/2016/03/19/c2/3b/Scenthound-Tim-Vogel.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Scenthound owner Tim Vogel is recruiting dog parents to bring their pup to Downtown at the Gardens on April 3.", "title": "Jupiter man needs help breaking record for doggie toothbrushing"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/resize/120x120/img/photos/2016/03/19/c2/3b/Scenthound-Tim-Vogel.jpg", "description": "Tim Vogel set a quirky goal in the name of doggie dental health.
