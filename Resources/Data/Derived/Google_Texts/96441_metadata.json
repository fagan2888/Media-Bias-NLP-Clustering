(Julie Percha/The Washington Post)\n\nSen. Rand Paul, (R-Ky.), a potential White House contender in 2016, is known for his belief in limited government. Here his take on Obamacare, the Constitution and more, in his own words. (Julie Percha/The Washington Post)\n\nWhen the presidential buzz began building around Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) a couple of years ago, the expectation was that his libertarian ideas could make him the most unusual and intriguing voice among the major contenders in the 2016 field.\n\nBut now, as he prepares to make his formal announcement Tuesday, Paul is a candidate who has turned fuzzy, having trimmed his positions and rhetoric so much that it\u2019s unclear what kind of Republican he will present himself as when he takes the stage.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to get his moment in the sun,\u201d said David Adams, who served as campaign chairman for Paul\u2019s insurgent 2010 Senate campaign. \u201cWhat he does with it from there will have bearing on the Republican Party.\u201d\n\nThere are at least two areas where Paul has moved more in line with the conservative Republican base, somewhat to the consternation of the purists in the libertarian movement: adopting a more muscular posture on defense and foreign policy, and courting the religious right.\n\nWhere he once pledged to sharply cut the Pentagon\u2019s budget, for instance, Paul late last month proposed a $190 billion increase over the next two years \u2014 albeit one that would be paid for by cutting foreign aid and other government programs. His tour following the announcement of his candidacy will include an event at Patriots Point in South Carolina\u2019s Charleston Harbor, with the World War II-era aircraft carrier USS Yorktown as a backdrop.\n\nWith an optimistic speech surmising that \"America's best days are ahead of us,\" Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) garnered big applause and chants of \"President Paul\" at the 2015 Conservative Political Action Conference. (AP)\n\n[Your online guide to Rand Paul]\n\nThe haziness over Paul\u2019s positions increased last week with his conspicuous silence on controversies in the realms of both national security and the cultural fronts.\n\nNearly all of his potential rivals for the 2016 GOP nomination have been vocal in their support for Indiana\u2019s new religious liberties law, which critics say would allow discrimination against gays. And the Republican response to President Obama\u2019s nuclear negotiations with Iran has been widespread skepticism.\n\nIn both instances, Paul\u2019s office said he was vacationing with his family and would not comment.\n\nWhat Paul says Tuesday and in several stops in the following days will be closely watched by a handful of disparate constituencies into which he has tried to make inroads over the past year, including Silicon Valley executives drawn to his libertarian ways and more traditional Republican business leaders who are wary of them. Attracted to his promise of expanding the GOP electorate, they have met with Paul, but many remain unsure of his electability, as well as his views.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s still the same guy. It\u2019s only how he\u2019s viewed that has changed,\u201d Adams said. \u201cHe\u2019s gone from somebody viewed as an oddity to somebody who\u2019s interesting. And on the issues, he has answered the same questions over and over, that he hasn\u2019t so much changed but shown a more three-dimensional side of where he\u2019s coming from.\u201d\n\nPaul also has been trying to find common cause with evangelical Christian voters, who have been skeptical of and even hostile toward the energized libertarian element of the GOP.\n\n\u201cThe First Amendment says keep government out of religion. It doesn\u2019t say keep religion out of government,\u201d he told a group of pastors at a private breakfast on Capitol Hill on March 26.\n\nHis tone was a signal, wrote David Brody of the Christian Broadcasting Network, that \u201cthis is not some \u2018crazy libertarian\u2019 who wants to distance himself from faith-and-government issues.\u201d\n\n[ 7 things to know about Rand Paul ]\n\nPaul has tried to reach out to African American voters as well with visits to historically black colleges, including a stop last month at Bowie State University in Maryland. While some conservatives have cheered his efforts and his calls for criminal-justice reform, others say he has not connected.\n\n\u201cI found him superficial,\u201d said Bob Woodson, president of the Center for Neighborhood Enterprise, who met privately with Paul on Capitol Hill a few months ago. \u201cI think these guys have got to do more than show up. Going to Howard [University] and then going to Ferguson [Missouri]? I don\u2019t know what that was all about. His talk about the militarization of police felt like pandering.\u201d\n\nIt is a tricky and delicate balancing act that the senator from Kentucky is trying to pull off: finding a way to make himself more acceptable to conservatives without dampening the enthusiasm of the boisterous, youthful and well-organized grass-roots network that his father, former congressman Ron Paul (R-Tex.), ignited in presidential bids in 2008 and 2012.\n\n\u201cRand has made it clear that his strategy is to embrace a broader group of Republicans than his dad captured,\u201d said Drew Ivers, Ron Paul\u2019s 2012 Iowa campaign chairman. \u201cWhether he can pull it off has yet to be proven, and he has significant challenges, even though he\u2019s a smart guy and capable.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe question is mathematics: How many people will he gain versus how many will he lose, both in terms of numbers and energy?\u201d said Ivers, who says he plans to stay on the sidelines this time around. \u201cI\u2019d prefer if he had a different strategy, reaching out his arms to the center-right and saying \u2018join me,\u2019 rather than meeting them in the middle.\u201d\n\nNick Gillespie, editor in chief of the libertarian magazine Reason, agreed: \u201cTo the extent he sounds more like every conservative Republican, he sounds less interesting to libertarians. I don\u2019t see what he picks up by being a version of Ted Cruz or Marco Rubio,\u201d two other freshman senators who are in the mix for the Republican nomination for 2016.\n\nThen again, Gillespie added, \u201che\u2019s not a doctrinaire libertarian. He\u2019s libertarian-ish. He\u2019s not his father.\u201d\n\nRand Paul\u2019s spokesman, Sergio Gor, said the senator appreciates the support from his father\u2019s \u00adcoalition and continues to draw Ron Paul backers.\n\n\u201cRand Paul and his father each attract new people to the party in their own unique ways, yet they both share a deep passion for liberty,\u201d Gor said by e-mail. \u201cAmong the thousands of people Sen. Paul meets every month, the most enthused and energetic are usually those individuals who supported his father. The same individuals continue to stand with Rand.\u201d\n\nRand Paul is also adjusting to changes in the overall political climate, particularly on foreign policy.\n\nComing out of the GOP\u2019s 2012 electoral defeat, it appeared that many Republicans had grown weary of war and were anxious to shake the George W. Bush brand of interventionist foreign policy. But that was before the rise of the Islamic State organization, with the horrific videos of hostage beheadings, and the descent of much of the Middle East into \u00adchaos.\n\n[ Is Rand Paul going mainstream--or vice versa?]\n\nNow, the more hawkish forces in the party are again taking the lead. And Paul\u2019s noninterventionist rhetoric is being tempered by declarations such as the one he made at the Conservative Political Action Conference in February that his priority would be \u201ca national defense unparalleled, undefeated and unencumbered by nation-building.\u201d (For the third year in a row, Paul won CPAC\u2019s presidential straw poll.)\n\nPaul\u2019s statements playing down the threat of a nuclear Iran have put him at odds with conservative Republicans in the past. More \u00adrecently, he angered non\u00adinterventionists when he joined 46 other Republican senators in signing a controversial letter, authored by Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), telling Iran\u2019s leaders that any nuclear deal would not be binding past the end of the Obama presidency if it were not agreed to by Congress.\n\nFormer House speaker Newt Gingrich, who won the South Carolina Republican primary in 2012, said that the message Paul will send with his event at Patriots Point is unmistakable: \u201cHe\u2019s announcing in a place of military strength, and probably will be talking about our need to remain strong.\u201d\n\nGingrich added: \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s political calculus. I think that\u2019s reacting to the real world.\u201d\n\nOthers are more skeptical about the shift.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what you call walking something back in a fast way,\u201d said former South Carolina Republican Party chairman Katon Dawson, who is supporting former Texas governor Rick Perry. \u201cLet me tell you: He\u2019s got a lot of explaining to do.\u201d\n\nIf Paul can find the sweet spot, making peace with the Republican base while maintaining his libertarian cred, the campaign calendar will give him some built-in advantages in a crowded GOP field.\n\nOf the first four state contests, two \u2014 Iowa and Nevada \u2014 are caucuses, where his prospects will be boosted by the energy and organizing power of the libertarian grass-roots network. And New Hampshire, whose official motto is \u201cLive Free or Die,\u201d is known for its antipathy to heavy-handed government.\n\n\u201cThis thing is front-loaded. The advantage goes to those that have an apparatus in place. Rand has an apparatus in place. He inherited that,\u201d said David Lane, a conservative Christian leader who has organized an effort to encourage evangelical pastors to become more politically active.\n\nBut how transferable are those loyalties in the face of what many Ron Paul supporters see as apostasies?\n\n\u201cHe is upsetting a lot of the more purist libertarians of his father\u2019s base. I see the rage all the time in my Facebook feed,\u201d said Rachel Mills, a former press secretary to Ron Paul who was campaign manager for Sean Haugh, the Libertarian Party\u2019s 2014 Senate nominee in North Carolina.\n\nBut she predicted, \u201cWhen he really gets started, all of us are going to be surprised with how much of the smart libertarian base is going to be there for him and really have his back.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sen.
