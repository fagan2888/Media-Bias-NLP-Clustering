The Ravens, which put the nevermore in Denver\u2019s dream of winning a Super Bowl last season, are back in town for the 2013 NFL lid-lifter. What concerns you the most about this game?\n\nI say it\u2019s Baltimore pass-rusher Elvis Dumervil, back to get revenge and create mayhem. Oren Lomena of The Press Box is worried about young Denver running backs playing good assignment football against Baltimore\u2019s stout defense. And Peter Burns? He ain\u2019t worried about nuthin\u2019.\n\nWatch us discuss what Denver needs to worry about against Baltimore up above.\n\nWhat must the Broncos do to avoid another upset against the Ravens? You tell us. And make a prediction of a final score, if you like.\n\nKick it with Kiz and Peter Burns by joining the discussion on Mile High Sports Radio Monday through Friday from 7-9 a.m. on The Press Box at The Denver Post or at 93.7 FM and 1510 AM on Mile High Sports Radio.\n\nFind Kiz on Twitter @MarkKiszla.
