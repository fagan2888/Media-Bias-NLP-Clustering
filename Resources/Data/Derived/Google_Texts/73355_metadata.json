It\u2019s a life-affirming song that aims to honor those on the Ebola front lines and is also the theme song for a public education campaign in Nigeria.\n\nHer name is Pardis Sabeti, and she\u2019s an award-winning computational geneticist at Harvard and the Broad Institute who has mapped mutations of the Ebola virus. Sitting in her lab\u2019s office on a recent rainy evening, she recalled a particularly bleak Sunday afternoon this past July.\n\nShe was gathered in Cambridge with six Nigerian and Senegalese women scientists who were visiting on a training exchange. Sabeti says they were thinking about how grim the situation was getting in Africa. So many of their friends and colleagues were among the scores of health care workers who\u2019d contracted the Ebola virus.\n\n\u201cTwo of the nurses had become sick and had died of Ebola,\u201d Sabeti explained. \u201cThe doctor/physician who we work with very, very closely had gotten Ebola. And my other collaborator in Nigeria had just diagnosed Ebola in Nigeria. And so it was a very heavy day, right? And just nothing was lifting us from the fog we were in.\u201d\n\nSabeti\u2019s Harvard lab has been partnering with the Kenema Government Hospital in Sierra Leone since 2009. And, as it happens, Sabeti has been in a rock band called Thousand Days since 2000. Over the past few visits with her African peers, the Harvard scientist would get everyone together for a weekly singing group, and on that depressing summer day, they all started humming and singing along with one of Sabeti\u2019s old melodies. Then, she said, words honoring her fallen peers in West Africa \u2014 including Dr. Sheik Humarr Kahn, who led Sierra Leone\u2019s Ebola response until he succumbed to the virus himself \u2014 poured out of her, making a fully formed song.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a point where it says, \u2018It\u2019s a lifetime that we write, we laugh, we cry, we pray, we are love. We dream, we scream, we strive, the hunger will never die. And I\u2019m in this fight with you always,\u201d Sabeti intoned, adding, \u201cAnd that\u2019s how I started speaking to my friend Dr. Kahn during all of this.\u201d\n\nAnother lyric, and perhaps the song\u2019s larger intention, hits on Ebola\u2019s ability to equalize and threaten us all.\n\n\u201cTo the virus, we\u2019re all the same,\u201d Sabeti mused, \u201cand we\u2019re all in the same boat. And a virus infecting your neighbor is one that can affect you one day. So it\u2019s a place where actually, even though we have to be cautious in the way we interact with each other, it\u2019s where we actually really need to connect.\u201d\n\nAnd she hopes that the way we handle this virus is something that leaves a lasting impression on humanity, \u201cWhere we say, you know, here\u2019s a place where we all did it together,\u201d Sabeti said.\n\nAccording to Sabeti, the entire song was written in that one July session. And she and the scientists from Africa believe it really did help them heal. So they decided to make a video to spread that feeling. It\u2019s on Facebook and they\u2019re all in it \u2014 smiling, dancing, singing and raising their hands to the New England sky.\n\n\u201cThese are the men and women who lead diagnosis of deadly diseases for their countries,\u201d Sabeti explained, \u201cThey work on malaria, they work on Lassa fever, and this summer we trained them to work on Ebola. So thankfully for them in Nigeria and Senegal they\u2019ve cleared Ebola \u2014 but obviously the threat is close, and it\u2019s weighing on all their minds. But as one of them said, \u2018This is the hope,\u2019 and that\u2019s what we really wanted to share.\u201d\n\nThey got their wish. Now, music from the video they filmed in a courtyard right outside the Cambridge lab is being used in public service announcements on T.V. and radio in Nigeria for an awareness campaign called \u201cLens on Ebola.\u201d Sabeti says the women scientists who came together to make it happen are now back home continuing their fight against Ebola \u2014 and fighting for their lives.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Harvard scientist and her African colleagues create an uplifting song about Ebola that both helps heal their grief over fallen colleagues and serves to educate the public.", "og": {"site_name": "commonhealth", "description": "A Harvard scientist and her African colleagues create an uplifting song about Ebola that both helps heal their grief over fallen colleagues and serves to educate the public.", "title": "Why Are These Scientists Singing About Ebola?", "url": "http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2014/10/singing-about-ebola", "image": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/15/files/2014/10/1003_ch-600-2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2014/10/singing-about-ebola", "image": "//s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/15/files/2014/10/1003_ch-600-2.jpg", "site": "@commonhealth", "card": "summary", "title": "Why Are These Scientists Singing About Ebola?"}, "DC.date.issued": "2014-10-03", "date": "Fri, 03 Oct 2014 14:50:49 -0400", "fb": {"admins": 1549080028, "app_id": 134067973330252}, "msvalidate.01": "D02D46BAEDB3F81FC1B1DE2A8CB69551"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd30ad\"", "article_summary": "Why Are These Scientists Singing About Ebola?\nSo many of their friends and colleagues were among the scores of health care workers who\u2019d contracted the Ebola virus.\nShe was gathered in Cambridge with six Nigerian and Senegalese women scientists who were visiting on a training exchange.\nand radio in Nigeria for an awareness campaign called \u201cLens on Ebola.\u201d Sabeti says the women scientists who came together to make it happen are now back home continuing their fight against Ebola \u2014 and fighting for their lives.\n\u201cTwo of the nurses had become sick and had died of Ebola,\u201d Sabeti explained."}
