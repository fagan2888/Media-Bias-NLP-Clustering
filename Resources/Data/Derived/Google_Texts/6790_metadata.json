He also seemed to call for Gov. John Kasich of Ohio to step aside to give Republicans a better chance to block Donald J. Trump\u2019s bid for the nomination.\n\nMr. Romney\u2019s vote in Utah, where he owns a house in Holladay, is not an endorsement, his allies stressed. Rather, it is part of his effort to unite the Republican Party around an alternative to Mr. Trump.\n\n\u201cToday, there is a contest between Trumpism and Republicanism,\u201d Mr. Romney, the 2012 Republican nominee, wrote on Facebook. \u201cThrough the calculated statements of its leader, Trumpism has become associated with racism, misogyny, bigotry, xenophobia, vulgarity and, most recently, threats and violence. I am repulsed by each and every one of these.\n\n\u201cThe only path that remains to nominate a Republican rather than Mr. Trump is to have an open convention,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAt this stage, the only way we can reach an open convention is for Senator Cruz to be successful in as many of the remaining nominating elections as possible.\u201d\n\nThis month, Mr. Romney delivered a scathing speech against Mr. Trump, calling him \u201ca fraud\u201d and \u201ca phony\u201d in urging his fellow Republicans to block him from securing the delegates needed to win the nomination.\n\nThough Mr. Romney campaigned with Mr. Kasich before the Ohio primary this week, he said in his Facebook post that Mr. Cruz represented the party\u2019s best chance to defeat Mr. Trump.\n\n\u201cI like Gov. John Kasich. I have campaigned with him. He has a solid record as governor. I would have voted for him in Ohio,\u201d Mr. Romney wrote. \u201cBut a vote for Governor Kasich in future contests makes it extremely likely that Trumpism would prevail.\u201d\n\nMr. Romney had for weeks been contemplating whether to make a more forceful statement about the candidates in the race. And his statement, even couched in praise of Mr. Kasich and without an explicit call for him to exit the contest, was surprising for a politician who has often been cautious .\n\nMuch of the Republican establishment has been reluctant about embracing Mr. Cruz, disdaining him as a self-centered politician who once called the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, a liar on the Senate floor. Mr. Cruz has been trying to forge a path for people to feel comfortable supporting him, and Mr. Romney\u2019s comments could give other prominent Republicans the cover to back the Texas senator.\n\nIn his message, Mr. Romney called Mr. Cruz the candidate best positioned to defeat Mr. Trump at the party\u2019s convention in July.\n\n\u201cI will vote for Senator Cruz and I encourage others to do so as well, so that we can have an open convention and nominate a Republican,\u201d Mr. Romney concluded.\n\nReacting to Mr. Romney\u2019s post, Mr. Trump took to Twitter to mock the former Republican nominee \u2014 and Mr. Cruz.\n\nFailed presidential candidate Mitt Romney, the man who \"choked\" and let us all down, is now endorsing Lyin' Ted Cruz. This is good for me! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 18, 2016\n\nAlice Stewart, a spokeswoman for Mr. Cruz, said the campaign was grateful for Mr. Romney\u2019s support. \u201cWe\u2019re thankful that Governor Romney will vote for Ted and agree that a vote for Ted Cruz is the only way to ensure that a Republican wins the nomination,\u201d she said.\n\nIn the past, Mr. Cruz has been less than effusive about Mr. Romney, suggesting he belonged to the party\u2019s \u201cmushy middle\u201d and arguing that Republicans would be foolish to nominate such candidates going forward.\n\nHe has also contended that Mr. Romney was ill-suited for the 2012 nomination because his health care overhaul as governor of Massachusetts was seen as a precursor to the Affordable Care Act, which Republicans (including Mr. Romney) have assailed.\n\nMr. Kasich, said that despite Mr. Romney\u2019s remarks, he was the candidate best positioned to win in November.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the only one of the three that can win a general election and beat Hillary Clinton,\u201d he said. \u201cI campaigned with Mitt, I like Mitt, and I just, it\u2019s a place where we just disagree.\u201d\n\nMaggie Haberman contributed reporting.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20160318160302, "twitter": {"description": "Mitt Romney will vote for Ted Cruz in Utah caucus Tuesday, but he is not describing it as an endorsement.", "title": "Mitt Romney Says He'll Vote for Ted Cruz in Utah Caucuses", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/03/18/mitt-romney-to-vote-for-ted-cruz/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2016/03/18/us/politics/18firstdraft-Romney/18firstdraft-Romney-thumbLarge.jpg", "site": "@NYTPolitics", "card": "summary"}, "sourceApp": "blogs", "hdl_p": "Romney Says He\u2019ll Vote for Cruz in Utah Caucuses", "blogpostid": 100000004280027, "CLMST": "Ashley Parker and Matt Flegenheimer", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "Uncategorized", "published_time": 1458331382, "modified_time": "2016-03-19T01:46:02-04:00", "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/politics/index.jsonp"}, "keywords": "Cruz Ted,Kasich John R,Romney Mitt,Trump Donald J,Endorsements,Presidential Election of 2016,Republican Party,Utah,Uncategorized", "news_keywords": "Political endorsement,Utah", "PT": "Blogs", "author": "Ashley Parker and Matt Flegenheimer", "SCG": "First Draft", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us/politics/firstdraft", "per": "Cruz, Ted;Kasich, John R;Romney, Mitt;Trump, Donald J", "byl": "Ashley Parker and Matt Flegenheimer", "BN": "first-draft", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/first-draft/post", "description": "Mitt Romney will vote for Ted Cruz in Utah caucus Tuesday, but he is not describing it as an endorsement.", "CG": "Politics", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "March 18, 2016", "live_stream_endpoint": "http://static01.nyt.com/live-coverage/first-draft/live-stream-endpoint-03182016.jsonp", "org": "Republican Party", "geo": "Utah", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20160319014602, "PUD": 20160318, "pdate": 20160318, "des": "Endorsements;Presidential Election of 2016", "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2016/03/18/us/politics/18firstdraft-Romney/18firstdraft-Romney-thumbLarge.jpg", "og": {"site_name": "First Draft", "description": "Mitt Romney will vote for Ted Cruz in Utah caucus Tuesday, but he is not describing it as an endorsement.", "title": "Mitt Romney Says He'll Vote for Ted Cruz in Utah Caucuses", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/03/18/mitt-romney-to-vote-for-ted-cruz/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2016/03/18/us/politics/18firstdraft-Romney/18firstdraft-Romney-facebookJumbo.jpg", "type": "article"}, "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "Mitt Romney Says He'll Vote for Ted Cruz in Utah Caucuses", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2016/03/18/us/politics/18firstdraft-Romney/18firstdraft-Romney-thumbLarge.jpg", "PST": "Blog Post", "DISPLAYDATE": "March 18, 2016"}, "article_summary": "In his message, Mr. Romney called Mr. Cruz the candidate best positioned to defeat Mr. Trump at the party\u2019s convention in July.\nMr. Romney\u2019s vote in Utah, where he owns a house in Holladay, is not an endorsement, his allies stressed.\nReacting to Mr. Romney\u2019s post, Mr. Trump took to Twitter to mock the former Republican nominee \u2014 and Mr. Cruz.\nMr. Kasich, said that despite Mr. Romney\u2019s remarks, he was the candidate best positioned to win in November.\nThough Mr. Romney campaigned with Mr. Kasich before the Ohio primary this week, he said in his Facebook post that Mr. Cruz represented the party\u2019s best chance to defeat Mr. Trump."}
