Say goodbye to your illusions of a kinder, gentler sisterhood in government.\n\nThe combined number of women in the U.S. House and Senate passed the 100 mark for the first time in November. And yet there was little cheer. Rutgers University\u2019s Center for American Women and Politics headlined its election analysis, \u201cWhen 100 isn\u2019t a passing grade.\u201d Pelosi, in a less-than-jubilant mood at her weekly news conference, detoured from her usual \u201cwhen women succeed, America succeeds\u201d message to register the uncharacteristically churlish complaint that, despite having been the first female speaker of the House, she had never made it to the cover of Time magazine.\n\nTruth be told, there wasn\u2019t all that much to celebrate, for a number of reasons. On November 3, there were 99 voting female members of Congress; starting this year, there will be 104\u2014a pretty paltry gain. Women candidates picked up 14 new seats in Congress overall\u2014the same as in 2010 but a far less impressive showing than in 2012, when they won 24 new seats, or in 1992\u2019s \u201cYear of the Woman,\u201d when they added a memorable 28. In fact, the five seats gained by women in 2014 were more than offset by the loss of a lot of actual female power. As part of the Republican takeover, Democratic women in the Senate were forced out of their positions at the helm of six out of 16 standing committees, and only a single Republican woman is expected to replace them as a committee chair, Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. In the House, only one of 21 standing committee chairmanships will be held by a woman\u2014Michigan\u2019s Candice Miller, who will continue to run the Committee on House Administration, where she will oversee such vital matters as reminding House members that they are allowed the \u201cincidental use\u201d of holiday greetings like \u201cMerry Christmas.\u201d Not exactly an overwhelming display of woman-power.\n\nAt left, Senator Elizabeth Warren at the Capitol in November, after being tapped for a Democratic leadership post.

It arises from unsettling questions about what it means, and whether it makes any difference, to be a female lawmaker in a time of hyperpartisanship.\n\nFemale politicians in America have long been viewed\u2014and sold to voters (and donors)\u2014as distinctly different from men, more grounded and tuned in to the real-life health and welfare needs of women, children and families; more collaborative and cooperative, \u201cmuch less about ego and much more about problem-solving,\u201d as Senator Debbie Stabenow of Michigan has put it. Women of color in particular, and black women especially, were known as advocates for a wide range of marginalized communities.\n\nThe moderates on both sides are out. Elizabeth Warren is a progressive icon. You\u2019re not going to see her reaching across the aisle to Joni Ernst.\u201d\n\nBut with women like Ernst (\u201cI grew up castrating hogs on an Iowa farm\u201d) coming to Washington to \u201cmake \u2019em squeal,\u201d those arguments are being severely challenged. Largely gone are the moderates\u2014Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas, Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas, Olympia Snowe of Maine, Connie Morella of Maryland\u2014whose example created the image of female politicians as uniquely able to reach across the bipartisan divide back in the 1980s and 1990s. Shelley Moore Capito, the first woman elected to the U.S. Senate from West Virginia and generally regarded as a moderate, may well serve as a co-captain of the bipartisan congressional women\u2019s softball team, but her desire to ban abortions after 20 weeks is not going to help her build substantial working relationships with many Democrats.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear: Republicans have not cornered the market on partisan pit bulls and ideological purists. \u201cThe moderates on both sides are out,\u201d says Michele Swers, an associate professor of American government at Georgetown University. \u201cElizabeth Warren [the Democratic senator from Massachusetts] is a progressive icon.
