Ra\u00fal Labrador, R-Idaho, told reporters Wednesday. \u201c\u2026 If those riders on Syria and pro-life issues and other issues like that are not in the bill, it\u2019s just not even worth considering the bill.\u201d\n\nLast week, the House passed legislation with a veto-proof majority requiring the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, the secretary of the FBI, and the director of National Intelligence to certify that each Syrian and Iraqi refugee coming to the U.S. through the refugee program doesn\u2019t pose a security threat.\n\nThe bill, called the America SAFE Act of 2015, also temporarily pauses the refugee program until screening procedures for Syrian and Iraqi refugees are implemented.\n\nIn 2016, the federal government plans to admit 10,000 Syrian refugees into the U.S.\n\nSpeaking to reporters, Labrador stressed that the omnibus spending package should include a policy rider with the America SAFE Act\u2019s language.\n\n\u201cAt a minimum, it should have the language that passed last week. What I\u2019m worried about is that our leadership is going to try to weaken even the language from last week,\u201d Labrador said.\n\n\u201cIf we can\u2019t even get that on the bill, then we\u2019re going to have a pretty big fight,\u201d he continued. \u201cI imagine we\u2019re going to have a robust discussion.\u201d\n\nLabrador said that he would like to see the spending bill also include language from a proposal floated by Rep. Brian Babin, R-Texas, that would block federal funding to resettle Syrian refugees until the Obama administration strengthens the vetting process.\n\nMore than 70 Republicans signed onto a letter sent to House GOP leadership asking them to include the language in the spending bill.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an important [issue], maybe the most important one, especially as we find ourselves in the context we do and focus on security,\u201d Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, told reporters Wednesday. \u201cThere will be a few folks who hear our position and probably speak out for more at the conference in support of Mr. Babin\u2019s position.\u201d\n\nIn addition to addressing Syrian refugees, conservatives on the panel today said they plan to offer a number of pro-life policy riders. Though the lawmakers did not specify on the language of the policy riders, one could strip Planned Parenthood of its federal funding.\n\n\u201cThe pro-life issues, protecting Americans, whether the unborn or the rest of our citizenry in terms of protecting ourselves from radical jihadists who are posing as refugees\u2014we must address that,\u201d said Rep. Tim Huelskamp, R-Kans. \u201cThat\u2019s a demand of my constituents, I believe constituents all across America.\u201d\n\nThough Republican lawmakers are looking to add conservative policy riders to the omnibus spending package, Jordan said the House Freedom Caucus, made up of around 40 conservatives, would oppose two specific proposals that may be added to the bill.\n\nJordan, who chairs the Freedom Caucus, said the group would oppose a campaign finance measure floated by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell eliminating caps that govern how much political parties can spend in coordination with candidates.\n\n\u201cWe think it\u2019s not the direction we need to go unless you\u2019re going to free up the restrictions on everyone,\u201d the Ohio Republican said.\n\nJordan also said the Freedom Caucus would oppose any measure that provides additional money to insurers through Obamacare\u2019s risk corridor program\u2014a stance that was echoed by fellow conservative lawmakers.\n\nThe risk corridor program, in place until 2017 and called an insurer \u201cbailout\u201d by some Republicans, was created to provide stability in the health insurance market. Through the program, insurers that profit above a specified threshold share a portion of their profit with the government. Those that lose more than a specified threshold receive financial assistance from the government.\n\n\u201cWe certainly don\u2019t want to bail out Obamacare and bailing out big insurance companies,\u201d Huelskamp said, referencing the risk corridors.
