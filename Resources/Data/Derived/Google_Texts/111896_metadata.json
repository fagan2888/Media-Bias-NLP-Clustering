With interests in insurance and finance \u2013 and past ownership of the Cincinnati Reds and Chiquita bananas \u2013 wealthy family members put their money behind Ohio Treasurer Josh Mandel's failed race for U.S. Senate in 2012.\n\nThis is why a recent donation stands out: Brothers Carl Lindner III and S. Craig Lindner, co-CEOs of American Financial Group, each gave $2,500 last month to the re-election campaign of U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown, new Federal Election Commission filings show.\n\nBrown, who defeated Mandel, is a liberal Democrat, one whose political positions, from financial regulation to the Affordable Care Act to entitlements, are the bane of nearly every other candidate and political cause the Lindner family supports. The Lindner Republican pedigree is so deep that the late patriarch, Carl H. Lindner Jr., used to fly in a private jet to meet with President Richard Nixon at the White House, hosted President George H. W. Bush at his vacation home in Key Largo, and raised hundreds of thousands of dollars to help elect President George W. Bush.\n\nThis would normally be a hell-freezes-over story, considering the generosity that the famously conservative family consistently shows to the GOP. There have been a few exceptions over the years, such as in the mid-1990s, when Carl Lindner Jr. gave heavily to Democrats when he needed Clinton administration help in an international trade dispute involving bananas. And a few years before his death, the elder Lindner gave $10,000 to the Democratic Governors Association in 2008.\n\nBut he gave ten times as much to the Republican Governors Association the same year -- on top of another $100,000 in 2007.\n\nBrown is another of those exceptions. Stitched together chronologically, this makes for a fascinating pattern.\n\n2006: Campaign finance records show that only one Lindner, Marsha, related to the others by marriage, gave to Brown that year \u2013 the year that Brown, a former House of Representatives member, won the Senate seat. And she only gave $1,000. (\"Only\" is a relative term here.)\n\nThe rest of the close-knit family, including spouses and an arm of the family that runs United Dairy Farmers, another Lindner-founded company, gave a total of $62,000 that year to Mike DeWine, an Ohio Republican who was then the Senate incumbent fighting to keep his seat. (He is now Ohio's attorney general.) Brown won. These figures are from Political Money Line, a service that provides a database of political donations and aggregates FEC records.\n\n2008: DeWine was out of office and Brown was serving in the Senate, with four years to go until his next election. The Lindners suddenly started giving to that re-election campaign, with a total of $6,900 by the end of 2008.\n\n2010: Brown now had two years to go before the election, and the Lindner family stepped up, for another $20,400. As with 2008, these donations included not only money from the Lindners running American Financial Group and their spouses but also from Keith Lindner, the brother of Carl III and Craig. Keith now lives in Florida but had helped run Chiquita Brands after the family gained controlling shares in 1984 and moved the company to Cincinnati. As the company struggled in 2001, the family relinquished control in a deal with bondholders. Under new ownership, Chiquita is now headquartered in North Carolina.\n\n2012: This was Brown's re-election year \u2013 and in a way, the Lindners spurned him.\n\nThey ponied up $51,000 for Mandel, his Republican challenger, but nothing for Brown. Brown certainly could apply their previous donations to this election. But the Lindners' financial support for Mandel was nearly double what they had given Brown in the previous years.\n\nNot only did more family members contribute to Mandel than to Brown, but their individual donations to Mandel were also higher. For example, Carl III had donated $4,400 to Brown in the years leading up to the election, yet he gave a full $5,000 \u2013 the maximum allowable under FEC rules \u2013 to Mandel.\n\n2014: Brown is now into his second year of his second term and has four years to go before his next election. But Carl III and Craig, arguably the most influential of the family members after their father's death, each gave Brown $2,500 in June, according to Brown's newest fundraising report to the FEC. Brown raised $412,037 in the latest quarter altogether, giving him $1.09 million on hand, with four years to raise more.\n\nThere are any number of reasons why the Lindner family might donate to Brown while generally ignoring other Democrats. They might want his ear on legislation that comes before him on the Senate Finance and Banking committees. Yet it has been several years since the company and its chief operating unit, Great American Insurance Group, filed Senate reports showing lobbying activity.\n\nThey might just like Brown more than they care for other Ohio Democrats in Congress -- to whom they give nothing, according to records.\n\nOr it could be a matter of sheer generosity. The Lindners are major philanthropists and a few thousand dollars is unlikely to be a big deal. The late Carl Lindner Jr., for example, his wife and a daughter-in-law each gave $2,000 in 2009 to the campaign of Lee Fisher, a Democrat running against Rob Portman for the U.S. Senate. Fisher was Ohio's lieutenant governor at the time.\n\nYet there was no question that the Lindners wanted Portman to win the race. As a private attorney more than two decades ago, Portman represented Chiquita Brands. Portman attended Cincinnati Country Day School at the same time as the Lindner brothers now running the family's businesses. And although a few Lindner family members gave Fisher $6,000 in total, the family gave Portman substantially more -- $84,050 -- to defeat the Democrat.\n\nThe Lindners typically do not discuss their political activity with the press. An American Financial Group representative told The Plain Dealer that he would inquire and that someone would respond if family members wished to comment for this article. No one has responded.\n\nBrown declined to speculate on why the Lindners are supporting him again. His communications director, Meghan Dubyak, said, \"Senator Brown appreciates the support he receives from all corners of the state, and from people across the political spectrum.\"\n\nIn the 1990s, years before the 2011 death of Carl Lindner Jr., the website for PBS's Frontline said of the Cincinnatian who built the family fortune and set the tone for its political activity: \"His friends defend his political giving as merely the generosity of a public-spirited citizen. His critics suspect that his money buys him political access and influence. In either event, he is one of several large contributors at the center of the controversy over whether the American campaign-finance system is serving the public interest.\"\n\nTo give a sense of the family's typical political benevolence and how unusual its support for Brown is, here are some of the Lindner family's more recent donations, based on figures from Political Money Line:\n\n$600,000 to Restore Our Future, a super PAC that supported Mitt Romney's presidential campaign in 2012, plus another $98,520 directly to Romney's campaign.\n\n$500,000 to American Crossroads, a political group partly formed by strategist Karl Rove, in 2012.\n\n$360,500 to the National Republican Congressional Committee since 2011.\n\n$199,924 to the Republican National Committee since 2012.\n\n$130,000 to the Ohio Republican Party State Central and Executive Committee since 2011.\n\n$40,000 to the Freedom Project, which is House Speaker John Boehner's personal leadership PAC, since 2011.\n\n$49,250 to Boehner's re-election campaign since 2011.\n\n$39,500 to the Republican Party of Cuyahoga County Federal Campaign Committee in 2012.\n\nAnd so on. Republicans aplenty.\n\nAnd then there's Brown.\n\nWhy?\n\n\"I wish I could help you,\" said Ohio Republican Party spokesman Chris Schrimpf. \"We're happy for the support they have given us, but beyond that, I can't really speak for them.\"", "article_metadata": {"article_author": "Stephen Koff, Northeast Ohio Media Group Washington Bureau Chief", "medium": "news", "news_keywords": "carl-lindner,josh-mandel,lindner,rob-portman,sherrod-brown", "title": "Sherrod Brown now getting support from major Republican family -- but why is a mystery", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Sherrod Brown now getting support from major Republican family -- but why is a mystery\", \"link\": \"http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2014/07/sherrod_brown_now_getting_supp.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.cleveland.com/home/cleve-media/width620/img/plain-dealer/photo/2014/07/14/15405297-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"13445026\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-07-21T11:08:59Z\", \"author\": \"Stephen Koff, Northeast Ohio Media Group Washington Bureau Chief\", \"tags\": [\"@mobile\",\"carl-lindner\",\"josh-mandel\",\"lindner\",\"rob-portman\",\"sherrod-brown\"] }", "twitter": {"site": "@clevelanddotcom", "image": "http://media.cleveland.com/plain-dealer/photo/2014/07/14/15405297-thumb_square_large.jpg", "description": "American Crossroads.
