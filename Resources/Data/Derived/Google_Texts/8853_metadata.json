Scalia, perhaps the court\u2019s most conservative justice, was viewed widely as the swing vote in the case known as Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association.\n\nBut should the Supreme Court eventually rule in favor of the challenge of union power by Rebecca Friedrichs, a 28-year veteran of the Savannah School District in Anaheim, Calif., the results could be dramatic.\n\nThe Center for Worker Freedom, a project of Americans for Tax Reform, provides a detailed look in the form of the just-released \u201c2016 Indicator of Labor Liberty,\u201d maps that show how a ruling in favor of Friedrichs and nine fellow teachers would affect other parts of the country as the \u201cright to work\u201d movement grows.\n\nThe center offers two versions of the map. One highlights the status quo of labor law across the country, the other demonstrates how government workers in 21 states would be freed from forced unionization if the high court rules mandatory dues unconstitutional.\n\nMap: Center for Worker Freedom\n\n\u201cWe went into each state\u2019s constitution, and a lot of them had specific statutes and codes written into them with regards to \u2018right-to-work\u2019 either in the public or private sector,\u201d Paige Halper, research fellow at the Center for Worker Freedom, told The Daily Signal. \u201cWe wanted to provide the most current and comprehensive classification of worker freedom.\u201d\n\nRight-to-work laws prohibit an employer and a union from signing a contract that would require workers to be union members. An \u201cagency shop\u201d requires that the workers who do not want to join the union pay the union a fee instead of union dues.\n\nLawyers for Friedrichs and the nine other teachers who took the education unions to court had been cautiously optimistic that Scalia would join with at least four other justices to rule in their favor based on comments he made Jan. 11 during oral arguments in the case.\n\nScalia had expressed skepticism toward the idea that political questions could be separated from the collective bargaining process; a point central to the plaintiffs\u2019 case.\n\nWhat happens next in the absence of a successor to Scalia\u2014whom Senate Republicans have vowed not to vote on until the next president takes office\u2014is a complicated question.\n\nCourt observers suspect the eight remaining justices are split evenly on the Friedrichs case, which would mean a 2014 ruling from the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals against the teachers, and for the unions, would remain in place.\n\nBut, as The Daily Signal previously reported, the Center for Individual Rights along with Michael Carvin, lead counsel for the teachers, have called on the high court to rehear the case once a new justice is name and confirmed.\n\nIf the court declines, lawyers for the teachers intend to file a motion for a rehearing.\n\nFriedrichs, an elementary school teacher and the lead plaintiff in the case, wants that rehearing.\n\nWhat the Case Is About\n\nFriedrichs joined with nine other California teachers and the Christian Educators Association International to file suit against the California Teachers Association and several local unions. CTA is the state division of the National Education Association, also named as a defendant.\n\nUnder California\u2019s \u201cagency shop\u201d law, teachers pay about $1,000 per year in union dues even if they don\u2019t belong to the union. Non-union members can apply to be reimbursed for the portion of dues that goes to political advocacy, usually $300 to $400.\n\nBut this \u201copt out\u201d process is cumbersome and difficult to navigate, Friedrichs and the other teachers in the case claim.\n\nAnd as Scalia made clear during oral arguments, the collective bargaining process itself is laced with political overtones, making it more difficult to distinguish between what costs are \u201cchargeable\u201d to non-members what are \u201cnon-chargeable.\u201d\n\nIn effect, this means that California teachers who are opposed to the political agenda of the teachers unions have to spend part of their work day financing political activism that cuts against their core beliefs, the plaintiffs argue.\n\nThis is also true of rank-and-file teachers across the country who oppose the far-left agenda embraced by many union leaders. Terry Pell, president of the Center for Individual Rights, has said the Friedrichs case must be re-argued before the Supreme Court since it involves a long-standing precedent that subverts First Amendment rights.\n\nMapping \u2018Labor Liberty\u2019\n\nIf Friedrichs and the other nine California teachers win a ruling against mandatory dues, after a rehearing or not, what would it mean for their state and others with similar agency shop laws?\n\nThe maps from the Center for Worker Freedom seek to provide a state-by-state answer. They measure labor freedom by the extent to which workers in the public (or government) and private sectors must support labor organizations.\n\nColor schemes distinguish the states. Red states have the most worker freedom, because a worker\u2019s decision whether to join a union or pay union fees is voluntary in both the public and private sectors. Blue states have the least freedom, because union requirements apply to both government and non-government workers.\n\nIn gray states, only the public sector allows a voluntary decision. Right now, Illinois is the one gray state.\n\nIf Friedrichs and the other teachers prevail at the Supreme Court, however, 21 other states now colored blue would switch to gray.\n\nSome states present peculiar or special cases: Kentucky, Wisconsin, Colorado, and Illinois all have some worker freedoms juxtaposed with forced unionization.\n\nThe maps demonstrate why state labor laws must be clarified, Matt Patterson, executive director of the Center for Worker Freedom, said. Patterson told The Daily Signal:\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of variation in how the laws and regulation are enacted from state to state. Colorado, for instance, has a bizarre, hybrid system where only some of the private sector is free. So, we are really finding a patchwork, which is why we thought a resource like this would be useful because of how contradictory and different these laws can be in certain states.\n\nMap: Center for Worker Freedom\n\nMixed Conditions\n\nWhile the Kentucky state legislature has failed to pass right-to-work legislation, 12 Kentucky counties passed laws banning mandatory union membership as a condition of employment.\n\nIn February, though, a district court judge ruled that only states may adopt right-to-work laws under the National Labor Relations Act, putting the county-level effort on hold.\n\nColorado is not a right-to-work state and so is not counted as \u201cfree\u201d in the public sector. However, workers are partially free in the private sector under the Labor Peace Act. Union dues are not illegal for private sector workers, but the union must win two majority elections and the employer must agree to the contract.\n\nEven if a Colorado union wins both elections, no all-union contracts will result if the employer refuses to enter the agreement. Put simply, private sector workers only pay dues in Colorado if the union wins both elections and the employer approves.\n\nIllinois is not a right-to-work state, and private sector workers must pay dues. However, Gov. Bruce Rauner, a Republican, has issued an executive order that prohibits state agencies from exacting \u201cfair share\u201d fees from state employees who don\u2019t choose to join a union.\n\nAfter Michigan passed right-to-work legislation for non-government workers, the Michigan Supreme Court ruled that it also must apply to government workers.\n\nIn Wisconsin, anyone who works for a police or fire department must help fund a union even if the employee is not a member of the union.\n\n\u2018A Lot of Momentum\u2019\n\nOne development this year is incorporated into the latest version of the \u201clabor liberty\u201d maps.\n\nOn Feb. 12, West Virginia became the 26th right-to-work state, as well as the 25th \u201cpublic and private voluntary\u201d state, after the legislature overrode a veto by Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin, a Democrat, of right-to-work legislation.\n\nUnder right-to-work laws, private sector workers are not required to pay union fees or join a union as a condition of their employment.\n\n\u201cThe biggest shift that would occur if the Supreme Court rules in favor of Friedrichs would be the shift from blue states to gray,\u201d the Center for Worker Freedom\u2019s Halper said. \u201cThose blue states would become \u2018free\u2019 in the public sector. So you would see fewer colors on our map. The reason we have so many colors now is because there are so many exceptions and bizarre contingencies.\u201d\n\nAssuming the Supreme Court acts decisively in favor of Friedrichs at some point, the center\u2019s Patterson said, a ruling that overturns forced unionization in the public sector will provide further impetus to right-to-work reforms in the private sector.\n\n\u201cIf we do get right-to-work for the entire public sector, it\u2019s going to create a lot of momentum and discussion about continued forced unionization in the private sector,\u201d he said, adding:\n\nI think laws are sometimes made purposely complicated and obtuse to prevent people from understanding what\u2019s really permitted and not permitted. Right now, everyone is reticent to act in labor relations because there are so many complicated and conflicting rules. We hope these maps provide some much needed clarity.\n\nA Matter of Interpretation\n\nJames Sherk, a labor economist with The Heritage Foundation whose expertise includes right-to-work trends, said the Center for Worker Freedom\u2019s map highlighting the status quo of state labor laws is \u201cmostly correct.\u201d Sherk, however, said he would recommend clarifications with an eye toward legal action that could uproot existing right-to-work initiatives.\n\nIn Illinois, for example, Sherk points out that the governor\u2019s executive order \u201cis tied up in litigation and is not currently in effect.\u201d Moreover, he says, the measure does not apply to local government employees such as school teachers.\n\nBut Patterson has a different interpretation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s true that Governor Rauner\u2019s executive order in Illinois is under legal challenge, and may eventually be struck down,\u201d he told The Daily Signal, adding:\n\nAs of now, however, it is on the books, and if public employees in Illinois are still paying dues, maybe they shouldn\u2019t be until the order is struck down. Unless and until that happens, we consider Illinois public servants\u2014and feel they should consider themselves\u2014freed by executive order.\n\nThis report has been updated to include James Sherk\u2019s observations.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u201cWe wanted to provide the most current and comprehensive classification of worker freedom,\u201d a researcher who helped map out answers tells The Daily Signal.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\u201cWe wanted to provide the most current and comprehensive classification of worker freedom,\u201d a researcher who helped map out answers tells The Daily Signal.", "title": "Where Does Your State Stand on Right to Work?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160315_FriedrichsMap_Mooney_feature.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-03-18T13:50:07+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1Uw8gV4"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\u201cWe wanted to provide the most current and comprehensive classification of worker freedom,\u201d a researcher who helped map out answers tells The Daily Signal.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160315_FriedrichsMap_Mooney_feature.jpg"}, "title": "Where Does Your State Stand on Right to Work?", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "labor", "published_time": "2016-03-16T16:04:43+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-18T13:50:07+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Friedrichs v.
