The Associated Press declared him the winner at about 9 p.m. He carried every county in the district.\n\n\n\nByrne will be sworn in next month as the next representative of the 1st District, which includes Mobile, Baldwin, Escambia, Monroe and Washington counties, as well as part of Clarke County.\n\nThe district has been without representation since Jo Bonner, R-Mobile, left office in August to take a job as vice chancellor of the University of Alabama System.\n\n\u201cYou wanted change in Washington, and we\u2019re going to bring it to you,\u201d Byrne told supporters at Moe\u2019s Original BBQ in Mobile.\n\nByrne promised to be a \u201cconservative reformer\u201d in the nation\u2019s capital.\n\n\n\n\u201cNot fight and not name call, but to get real results,\u201d he said. \u201cFight hard against the Washington establishment holding our nation back. We are a great country but we are not acting like a great country in Washington.\u201d\n\nLeFlore, 48, is the grandson of John LeFlore and attended the high school named for the late civil rights icon.\n\nHe had no prior political experience except for a failed run for the state House of Representatives earlier this year in a race to replace Rep. Yvonne Kennedy, D-Mobile, after her death. LeFlore, who works as a Realtor, ran as an independent for that seat and claimed just 7 percent of the vote against Adline Clarke.\n\nIn the race for Congress, LeFlore easily dispatched Lula Albert-Kaigler in the Democratic primary but found it difficult to gain traction against Byrne\u2019s better-funded campaign.\n\nLeFlore said he would not concede until complete results from Mobile County were in, although he did eventually call Byrne to offer his congratulations.\n\n\u201cIf I don\u2019t emerge the victor, my advice to Byrne would be we need bipartisanship in Washington,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have got to work with our president and certainly we\u2019ve got to do what\u2019s right for the people (here).\u201d\n\nThe timing of the election will spare Byrne from having to cast a difficult vote early in his congressional career on the budget. The House and Senate both have approved a two-year compromise deal that amounts to a temporary truce between the parties on the taxes and spending. Byrne had declined to take a position on the proposal, citing the need to study the details.\n\nBut Byrne will find a full plate when he does take office. The deal to ease some of the automatic budget cuts known as sequestration notwithstanding, Congress will have long-term issues of deficits and entitlement spending to grapple with. Issues related to President Barack Obama\u2019s heath care law might also come up. Byrne is on record against what is popularly known as Obamacare.\n\nByrne also will go to work on local issues he has promised to champion, including securing funding for a long-debated Interstate 10 bridge over Mobile Bay, deepening Mobile\u2019s shipping channel and protecting Austal USA\u2019s military contracts.\n\nByrne, a lawyer by training, has been in politics since the 1990s when he first won election to the state Board of Education as a Democrat. He later switched parties and served as a Republican in the state Senate, representing a district on the Eastern Shore.\n\nThen-Gov. Bob Riley tapped him in 2007 to take over a scandal-ridden two-year college system. He touted his record there during his 2010 campaign for governor and entered the race as the front-runner. He finished first in the Republican primary but found himself the target of an all-out effort by the state teachers union \u2013 with whom he had tangled as two-year college chancellor \u2013 to defeat him.\n\nThe beneficiary was Robert Bentley, who won the race and went on to win the election.\n\nThe defeat left Byrne out of public service for the first time since 1994. On the campaign trail this year, he attempted to douse speculation that he would use a congressional seat as a launching pad for another run for governor, saying this would be his last office.\n\nStaff reporters John Sharp and Michael Finch II contributed to this report.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "AL-01, Bradley Byrne, Burton LeFlore, news", "title": "Bradley Byrne cruises to landslide victory over Burton LeFlore in congressional race", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Bradley Byrne cruises to landslide victory over Burton LeFlore in congressional race\", \"link\": \"http://blog.al.com/live/2013/12/bradley_byrne_header.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://image.al.com/home/bama-media/width620/img/mobile-press-register/photo/2013/12/13956651-large.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"11843844\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-12-18T03:00:44Z\", \"author\": \"Brendan Kirby\", \"tags\": [\"@elections\",\"@river-all\",\"@river-beaches\",\"AL-01\",\"Bradley Byrne\",\"Burton LeFlore\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://image.al.com/home/bama-media/width620/img/mobile-press-register/photo/2013/12/13956651-large.jpg", "description": "Bradley Byrne, 58, won about two-thirds of the vote, according to incomplete and unofficial returns.
