Billings, MT

A Billings family picked up a dangerous hitchhiker on the way back from Yellowstone National Park.

A grizzly bear latched onto the family's car just outside of Cooke City and the entire experience was caught on camera.

"There's a bear on my car, oh my gosh!" says one woman sitting in the vehicle.

In a rare bear encounter, one Montana family sat face to face with a grizzly.

"They were just grazing mostly on the grass and weren't bothering anybody," said David Peters, the driver of the vehicle. "Then one of the bears decided to check out one of the cars across the street and he did. Then he dropped down and bee-lined right for our vehicle."

David Peters said the experience behind a few inches of glass was really more exciting than scary.

"It wasn't really scary for me and my wife; we'd seen bears before," said Peters. "The bears didn't show any sign of aggression, they were more curious than anything else."

But what the camera doesn't show is that Peters was outside of the vehicle, snapping pictures of the bears.

As one bear came toward the vehicle, Peters sneaked around the back and hopped in the back seat.

"I was kind of playing this which way is he going with the bears," said Peters. "It's five seconds of inattention that was really not good. It could've been disastrous if that bear had come straight for me instead of the front of the car like he did."

He caught a lucky break.

Peters walked away from the incident with only a few minor scratches --- on his car, and an unforgettable memory caught on camera.

In the video, a young girl can be heard shouting: "He smells the beef jerky!"

"I asked my friend's daughter Elise if she thought she'd have nightmares over the whole thing," said Peters. "And she said 'Are you kidding me? This is the best day of my life ever!'"

Peters' car still has the scratch marks and mud smears from the bear's paws.

For now, Peters said his wife won't let him wash the evidence of the story away.
