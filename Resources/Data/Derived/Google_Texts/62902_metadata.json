(REUTERS/David Ryder)\n\n4055641\n\nA nationwide minimum wage of $12 per hour would shrink government, aid families, curb illegal immigration, spur high-tech investment, and boost GOP support among working-class voters, says Ron Unz, the California libertarian entrepreneur who wiped out his state\u2019s Spanish-only K-12 classes.\n\nThe $12 wage would slash the huge taxpayer subsidies now given to companies that hire low-wage immigrants, and move tens of millions of Americans into the middle class and sharply reduce the 47 percent of the population who are now completely or partly dependent on federal handouts, Unz told The Daily Caller.\n\n\u201cPolitics would be completely different\u2026 what you\u2019re doing is reducing the 47 percent by 10 to 15 points and giving Republicans a chance to make their case about cutting government spending and reducing taxes,\u201d he said.\n\nUnz\u2019s unorthodox proposal is likely to catch fire, partly because he\u2019s working to put it on California\u2019s ballot this year and force Democratic and Republican politicians to take sides by November.\n\nUnz\u2019s proposal ups the ante as Democrats push for a national $10.10 minimum wage during the 2014 campaign, amid public anger over the Obamacare takeover of the nation\u2019s health sector.\n\nThe plan is also likely to get traction because it offers the public a good-news alternative to the business-backed campaign to triple the inflow of low-skill immigrant labor during the next decade. If implemented, the $12 alternative plan would instead flood American businesses with Americans who have dropped out of the workforce, and also push low-skilled illegals to the sidelines and eventually south of the border, he says.\n\nUnder the current minimum wage level of $7.25 per hour, roughly 1.8 million Americans under age 30 aren\u2019t even looking for work.\n\nThis minimum wage argument is gaining ground among conservatives. This week, for example, conservative icon Phyllis Schlafly, called for an increase in the minimum wage. \u201cLegislation to raise the minimum wage would elevate many low-wage earners above the income threshold that qualifies them for benefits and should result in reduced welfare spending,\u201d said Schalfly, who earned the undying hatred of progressives in 1977 by blocking the Equal Rights Amendment.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a tradeoff Republicans could support,\u201d she added.\n\nUnz is an unorthodox conservative, who made his fortune in California by creating a financial-services software company\n\nPolitically, he made his mark in 1998 by ending the using the state ballot initiative to ban the union-backed practice of teaching immigrants kids in Spanish. The so-called \u201cbilingual education\u201d program paid teachers extra, but left huge numbers of Hispanics with little education and less chance of a middle-class career, he said.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Neil Munro", "description": "'That's a tradeoff Republicans could support'", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "A nationwide minimum wage of $12 per hour would shrink government, aid families, curb illegal immigration, spur high-tech investment, and boost GOP support among working-class voters, says Ron Unz, th", "title": "$12 an hour is conservative rocket fuel, says Ron Unz", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/01/10/12-an-hour-is-conservative-rocket-fuel-says-ron-unz/", "image": {"width": 630, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/RTX13160-e1385501560317.jpg", "height": 269}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "'That's a tradeoff Republicans could support'", "title": "$12 an hour is conservative rocket fuel, says Ron Unz Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/01/10/12-an-hour-is-conservative-rocket-fuel-says-ron-unz/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/RTX13160-e1385501560317.jpg"}, "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-01-10 23:42:37", "sailthru.title": "$12 an hour is conservative rocket fuel, says Ron Unz", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "sailthru.tags": "economy,immigration,minimum-wage,neil-munro", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "keywords": "economy,immigration,labor economy,minimum wage", "sailthru.description": "A nationwide minimum wage of $12 per hour would shrink government, aid families, curb illegal immigration, spur high-tech investment, and boost GOP support among working-class voters, says Ron Unz, th", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/RTX13160-e1385501560317.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2206\"", "article_summary": "This week, for example, conservative icon Phyllis Schlafly, called for an increase in the minimum wage.\nStephen Baldwin holds his fist in the air outside a Subway restaurant during a strike aimed at the fast-food industry and the minimum wage in Seattle, Washington Aug. 29, 2013.\nThis minimum wage argument is gaining ground among conservatives.\nUnder the current minimum wage level of $7.25 per hour, roughly 1.8 million Americans under age 30 aren\u2019t even looking for work.\nUnz\u2019s proposal ups the ante as Democrats push for a national $10.10 minimum wage during the 2014 campaign, amid public anger over the Obamacare takeover of the nation\u2019s health sector."}
