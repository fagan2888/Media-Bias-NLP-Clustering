Take a breath.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s the message for those of us in Minnesota who enrolled in MNSure \u2013 the state\u2019s Affordable Care Act health exchange \u2013 and chose PreferredOne as our health insurance provider in 2014. Earlier this week, it was announced that PreferredOne, MNSure\u2019s leading insurer, was pulling out of the online marketplace for 2015. As a PreferredOne subscriber through MNSure who did not receive federal subsidies, my knee-jerk reaction was panic.\n\nBut when the dust settled on the screeching headlines and news reports of impending MNSure doom and one read through what actually happened and what it meant for me and other Minnesota consumers, the reality was \u201cthank goodness there\u2019s an exchange and a marketplace that offers us choices.\u201d\n\nReminded of the \u2018bad old days\u2019\n\nBefore the ACA, a policy cancellation notice would have left many of us scratching our heads and wondering what to do next for health insurance coverage. In fact, many of us would have known the terrifying reality that no coverage was possible if we had pre-existing conditions.\n\nBut, because of the ACA, it means that we here in Minnesota still have access to health insurance via four other health plans on the exchange when open enrollment begins in November. (The other carriers include: HealthPartners, UCare, BlueCross and BlueShield of Minnesota, and Medica.)\n\nWhy did PreferredOne \u2013 a relative newcomer to the state\u2019s individual health insurance marketplace \u2013 decide to leave? At this point, their executives have maintained a \u201cNo comment\u201d position. Industry analysts have suggested that the company may not have had the resources to handle the influx of new customers. Others suggested PreferredOne priced its plans too low and realized that the only way to compete in 2015 was to show a significant rise in premiums.\n\nOr as Jennifer Schultz, an economics professor at the University of Minnesota-Duluth and a 2014 candidate for the Minnesota House of Representatives said, \u201cThe Affordable Care Act and MNsure are programs based on market capitalism. In market capitalism, we expect that some players will find difficulty in competing and make mistakes. We expect the market to weed them out.\u201d\n\nWhat it means for PreferredOne customers\n\nWhat does it mean for me and the approximately 10 percent of the 327,000 Minnesotans insured through MNSure via PreferredOne?\n\nWe need to remain diligent in finding a new carrier if we choose that path, which is still a better option than being left out in the cold.\n\nIf we purchased PreferredOne without the federal subsidies, staying with PreferredOne is still a viable option. We simply purchase the new policy outside of the MNSure process.\n\nIf we purchased PreferredOne with federal subsidies, those same subsidies will apply to the carriers who remain a part of MNSure.\n\nWe may experience a disruption in network providers. For me, that may not be so bad. I can personally attest to PreferredOne\u2019s failure to have network contracts in place with their \u201cadvertised\u201d network providers, which resulted in some of my claims processing as \u201cout-of-network.\u201d It took intense perseverance on my part (and help from the Minnesota Department of Health) to have those claims finally process as \u201cin-network.\u201d\n\nWait patiently as the state\u2019s Commerce Department actuaries crunch the numbers and negotiate rate increases.\n\nUse an insurance broker to help you as you weigh options. \u201cMost people should be able to find something they can afford,\u201d said Sheryl Frieman, an independent broker for Array Financial Services in Minneapolis after the PreferredOne announcement was made.\n\nExit from exchange isn\u2019t the norm\n\nIn reality, the news on MNSure appears to be the exception \u2013 not the norm \u2013 around the country. New Hampshire, Washington and Michigan are all adding four carriers, and five new carriers applied to participate in Indiana. In Kentucky, Kynect is adding two new medical carriers and two new dental carriers. Even mega-giant United Healthcare is joining the exchange in Georgia and will offer statewide coverage along with three other plans. (Only one of them offered statewide coverage in 2014).\n\nUnited\u2019s Chief Executive Stephen Hemsley said the company \u2013 which largely sat out participation in the ACA\u2019s exchanges nationwide in 2014 \u2013 has learned about pricing, regulations and consumer attitudes while taking a \u201cprudent first-year position\u201d on the public exchanges. He suggested that, as more people use the exchanges in 2015, the risk will go down for insurers.\n\nAs long as health care delivery in this country remains marketplace driven, we can expect the fluctuations of the marketplace to impact how we access health insurance. As consumers we need to stay informed and stay focused. And to remember that, thanks to the ACA, we don\u2019t have to panic.", "article_metadata": {"description": "When the dust settled on the screeching headlines \u2026 of impending MNSure doom \u2026 the reality was \"thank goodness there's an exchange and a marketplace that offers us choices.\"", "og": {"site_name": "Health Insurance Resource Center", "description": "When the dust settled on the screeching headlines \u2026 of impending MNSure doom \u2026 the reality was \"thank goodness there's an exchange and a marketplace that offers us choices.\"", "title": "Stay calm and find another MNsure plan", "url": "https://www.healthinsurance.org/blog/2014/09/18/stay-calm-and-find-another-mnsure-plan/", "image": "https://www.healthinsurance.org/assets/2014/09/PreferredOne-exits-MNsure.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1007310172}, "keywords": "health insurance exchange, health insurance marketplace, Joanne Boyer", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-18T20:00:44+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda4fa\"", "article_summary": "Why did PreferredOne \u2013 a relative newcomer to the state\u2019s individual health insurance marketplace \u2013 decide to leave?\nIf we purchased PreferredOne with federal subsidies, those same subsidies will apply to the carriers who remain a part of MNSure.\nAs a PreferredOne subscriber through MNSure who did not receive federal subsidies, my knee-jerk reaction was panic.\nTake a breath.\u201dThat\u2019s the message for those of us in Minnesota who enrolled in MNSure \u2013 the state\u2019s Affordable Care Act health exchange \u2013 and chose PreferredOne as our health insurance provider in 2014.\nAs long as health care delivery in this country remains marketplace driven, we can expect the fluctuations of the marketplace to impact how we access health insurance."}
