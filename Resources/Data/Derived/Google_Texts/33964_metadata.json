A search for a permanent replacement is underway.\n\n\n\n\u201cMark has worked as hard as anyone on my team over the last four years,\u201d said Gov. Shumlin. \u201cMark led the Department through some challenging times, but no one cared more or tried harder to overcome those challenges so Vermonters could access affordable health care than Mark. Thanks to the work of Mark and others, tens of thousands more Vermonters are now insured. I appreciate his service and understand his desire to take some time to step back and explore new opportunities.\"\n\n\n\nThe Governor's Office says to ensure continuity of management of critical projects during the leadership transitions, Department of Health Commissioner Harry Chen will serve as Chair of the Health and Human Services Enterprise Program Executive Steering Committee. He will provide daily executive oversight of Vermont Health Connect, Integrated Eligibility, and Medicaid Management Information Systems projects. He will report to Agency of Human Services Secretary Hal Cohen.\n\n\n\nDuring Larson's time at Vermont Health Access, he helped expand Medicaid services provided for by the Affordable Care Act and develop the state's insurance marketplace, Vermont Health Connect.\n\nCopyright 2016 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc.
