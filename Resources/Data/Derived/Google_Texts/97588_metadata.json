Since then \u2013 and without significant congressional or judicial oversight \u2013 that law has been used to combat these groups in Afghanistan and elsewhere. It has also been used to conduct targeted killings in Yemen, Somalia, and Pakistan, hold prisoners at Guantanamo without charge or trial, and conduct wide-ranging surveillance programs. Most recently, President Obama has used the 2001 AUMF to attack ISIL, an organization that did not exist on 9/11.\n\nMembers of Congress and national security experts \u2013 from both parties and with varying views about using military force to combat terrorist threats \u2013 are unhappy with how the 2001 AUMF has been stretched almost beyond recognition. Now, the debate on an ISIL AUMF has given Congress the opportunity to re-assert its oversight, prevent a recurrence of what happened to the 2001 AUMF, and begin to re-calibrate that outmoded authorization. Congress can now reduce the ability of this or any future president to exert unchecked authority that may undermine the rule of law and human rights.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe president's proposed AUMF is a start, but it doesn't really accomplish these goals. To get there, Congress should begin by asking the top administration officials, testifying at Wednesday\u2019s Senate hearing \u2013 Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter, and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Martin Dempsey \u2013the following questions.\n\n1. Why doesn\u2019t President Obama\u2019s ISIL AUMF address the 2001 AUMF?\n\nObama has claimed that he has all the authority he needs to fight ISIL in the 2001 AUMF, although he would ultimately like to refine and repeal it. Logically, proposing a new authorization for ISIL should clarify the role of the 2001 AUMF in that fight. Yet the president\u2019s proposal is silent. Silence allows a future administration \u2013 when the ISIL AUMF expires \u2013 to continue to fight ISIL under the 2001 AUMF without any limitations. This is an absurd result.\n\n\n\nIncluding a 2001 AUMF sunset in an ISIL AUMF and stating that the ISIL AUMF is the sole authority to use force against ISIL are crucial to ensuring that congressional intent is not disregarded.\n\nA sunset would also enhance congressional oversight by forcing a future conversation between Congress and the administration on the scope of the conflict with al Qaeda, the Taliban, and their associated forces to determine whether the 2001 AUMF should be refined and reauthorized to suit an evolving conflict, or expire. A 2001 AUMF sunset has support from members of both parties; Sen. Rand Paul Rand PaulOvernight Defense: VA chief 'deeply' regrets Disney remark; Senate fight brews over Gitmo Paul ties release of 9/11 docs to defense bill Will Ted Cruz let it go? MORE (R-Ky.) included one in his ISIL AUMF proposal, as did the ISIL AUMF passed by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee last year. Sunsets are included in other major counterterrorism legislation like the PATRIOT Act and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, and Congress has refined and reenacted these statutes to better suit changing circumstances.\n\nLast year, Kerry said that the administration \u201cwill support the inclusion of language in the new AUMF that will clarify that the [ISIL] specific AUMF rather than the 2001 AUMF is the basis for the use of military force.\u201d Congress should ask Kerry and the other witnesses if they would support including this clarifying language and a 2001 AUMF sunset in an ISIL AUMF.\n\n2. Why is the president\u2019s proposed AUMF definition of \u201cassociated persons and forces\u201d even broader than the definition the administration already uses?\n\nObama\u2019s proposal defines \u201cassociated persons and forces\u201d as \u201cindividuals or organizations fighting for, on behalf of, or alongside ISIL or any closely-related successor entity in hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners.\u201d This is broader than the definition of \u201cassociated forces\u201d that the administration uses to target groups under the 2001 AUMF\u2014a definition that is already overbroad.\n\nBy including \u201csuccessor\u201d organizations, the proposed definition could allow the administration to use force against groups or individuals not engaged in armed conflict with the United States.\n\nThe president already has authority under Article II of the Constitution to target groups or individuals who pose an imminent threat to the United States.\n\nCongress should ask the witnesses why the administration is expanding its own definition of \u201cassociated forces\u201d to include \u201csuccessor\u201d organizations and whether they would support narrowing the ISIL AUMF\u2019s \u201cassociated persons and forces\u201d definition to limit war authorities to groups who are actually engaged in armed conflict with the United States.\n\n3. What does it mean to \u201cdegrade and defeat\u201d ISIL?\n\nThe administration\u2019s proposal lacks mission objectives. An ISIL AUMF should clearly state what success would look like. This would let us know when the authorization may expire: when the objectives have been met. An example could be degrading the group\u2019s capacity so it can no longer pose a continuing threat of armed attacks against regional partners or the United States.\n\nCongress should ask the administration witnesses what \u201cdegrading and defeating\u201d ISIL would look like and if they would support including these objectives in an ISIL AUMF.\n\nTop national security lawyers have proposed six principles for an ISIL AUMF, and Congress should take their advice. It\u2019s Congress\u2019s responsibility to exercise oversight and place limits on military force. It should step up to the plate by questioning Kerry, Carter, and Dempsey tomorrow and passing an ISIL AUMF that that sunsets and supersedes the 2001 AUMF, only targets groups that are engaged in armed conflict, and outlines concrete mission objectives. This will make clear to Americans and to the world exactly who we are at war with and to what end.\n\nBrandon is Human Rights First\u2019s associate attorney for national security.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Members of Congress and national security experts are unhappy with how the 2001 AUMF has been stretched almost beyond recognition.", "description": "Members of Congress and national security experts are unhappy with how the 2001 AUMF has been stretched almost beyond recognition.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Congress Blog"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Members of Congress and national security experts are unhappy with how the 2001 AUMF has been stretched almost beyond recognition.", "title": "Three things Congress should ask the administration about ISIL AUMF", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/foreign-policy/235226-three-things-congress-should-ask-the-administration-about", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-02T03:29:10-05:00", "type": "article"}, "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-02T03:29-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/foreign-policy/235226-three-things-congress-should-ask-the-administration-about", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2015-03-11T07:00-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Joe Picard", "author": "Heather Brandon", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-11T07:00:03-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-02T03:29:10-05:00"}, "keywords": ",John Kerry, Rand Paul,", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/foreign-policy/235226-three-things-congress-should-ask-the-administration-about", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Members of Congress and national security experts are unhappy with how the 2001 AUMF has been stretched almost beyond recognition.", "card": "summary", "title": "Three things Congress should ask the administration about ISIL AUMF"}, "dcterms.title": "Three things Congress should ask the administration about ISIL AUMF"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1322\"", "article_summary": "MORE (R-Ky.) included one in his ISIL AUMF proposal, as did the ISIL AUMF passed by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee last year.\nIncluding a 2001 AUMF sunset in an ISIL AUMF and stating that the ISIL AUMF is the sole authority to use force against ISIL are crucial to ensuring that congressional intent is not disregarded.\nSilence allows a future administration \u2013 when the ISIL AUMF expires \u2013 to continue to fight ISIL under the 2001 AUMF without any limitations.\nWhy doesn\u2019t President Obama\u2019s ISIL AUMF address the 2001 AUMF?\nCongress should ask the administration witnesses what \u201cdegrading and defeating\u201d ISIL would look like and if they would support including these objectives in an ISIL AUMF."}
