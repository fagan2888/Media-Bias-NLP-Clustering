As we move closer towards the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate deadline, the fight between those who want “young invincibles” to sign up for health insurance and those who want them to opt-out is heating up. The Daily Show’s Aasif Mandvi traveled to Colorado to speak to the group behind the now-infamous “Brosurance” Obamacare ads, which use keg stands and promiscuous sex to sells health care to young people.



Meanwhile, conservative activist group GenerationOpportunity is using their mascot, Creepy Uncle Sam, to try to convince young people they don’t need the government in their doctor’s office. When that doesn’t work, they throw parties with corn hole games, and, yes, more beer.

Not to be outdone, Mandvi decided to show these groups how to really “pander to modern youth” but doing his best impression of James Franco’s character from the movie Spring Breakers. “Bikinis, big booties and health care, y’all, that’s what life is about!”
