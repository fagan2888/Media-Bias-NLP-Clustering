Native stones lay in 11 concentric circles on the ground to the north of St. Stephen's Episcopal Church in Longmont.

The outer circle is about 60 feet in diameter encompassing the other 10 circles, which create a labyrinth that opens to a meditation garden and pagoda at the Longmont Buddhist Temple across the street.

The project has been underway for about six months and was orchestrated by St. Stephen's head pastor Max Bailey. After months of planning, volunteers will complete the labyrinth Saturday and open to the public.

"We wanted to create a holy and sacred place, where people can come get some quiet," Bailey said. "We don't get enough quiet in this world and we need more space to hear our own wheels turning and to connect with ourselves and with God."

The church will use the labyrinth to host special events like the Easter tradition stations of the cross, lessons for children and evening prayer walks through the candle-lit path.

Bailey expects mostly church members to use the labyrinth but said he hopes members of the public and neighbors in the area will also take advantage.

The church purchased a canvas labyrinth more than 15 years ago following a workshop where Bailey learned about the science behind the circles.

"Something happens when we make a certain number of left and right turns that calms the brain," Bailey said. "It's about saying prayers and walking, which makes it a whole-body experience."

The canvas walls are constructed and taken down whenever they're needed, Bailey said, but the new stone labyrinth will be a permanent fixture that he hopes will inspire peace.
