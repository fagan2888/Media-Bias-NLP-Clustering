Ted Cruz on its bestseller list.\n\nCruz, R-Texas, who is a 2016 presidential candidate, published his book, \u201cA Time for Truth,\u201d on June 30. On Thursday, Politico reported that the book \u201csold 11,854 copies in its first week:\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s more than 18 of the 20 titles that will appear on the bestseller list for the week ending July 4. Aziz Ansari\u2019s \u201cModern Romance,\u201d which is #2 on the list, sold fewer than 10,000 copies. Ann Coulter\u2019s \u201cAdios, America,\u201d at #11, sold just over half as many copies.\n\nCruz\u2019s book should have qualified to be in third place on the list of hardcover nonfiction, but \u201cA Time for Truth\u201d is absent from The New York Times Bestseller list for the week of July 5.\n\n\u201cIn the case of this book, the overwhelming preponderance of evidence was that sales were limited to strategic bulk purchases,\u201d a spokesperson for The New York Times told Politico.\n\nAuthors, publishers or marketing firms will sometimes organize bulk purchases of books, allowing the title to climb the bestseller lists, only to return the books at a later date. Many media outlets who rank book sales, including The New York Times, attempt to omit these purchases from their rankings.\n\nBut Cruz\u2019s campaign and the publisher of his book refuted The New York Times\u2019 claim that the sales of the book are not authentic.\n\nThe New York Times is lying \u2014 they should release their evidence or issue a formal apology https://t.co/CMqlbrkysS pic.twitter.com/K3mQhmNsqf \u2014 Team Cruz (@TeamTedCruz) July 10, 2015\n\nIn a statement to BuzzFeed News, HarperCollins publicity director Tina Andreadis said that the publisher \u201chas investigated the sales pattern for Ted Cruz\u2019s book\u201d and \u201cfound no evidence of bulk orders or sales through any retailer or organization\u201d:\n\nA TIME FOR TRUTH ranked high on other publishing industry bestseller lists including Nielsen Bookscan, a subscription service that tracks the vast majority of book sales in America, The Wall Street Journal and Barnes and Noble. All these outlets omit bulk orders books from their rankings.\n\nIn a statement, the Cruz campaign said that The New York Times \u201cis lying.\u201d\n\nCruz campaign spokesperson Rick Tyler said in the statement that the claim \u201cis a blatant falsehood.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe evidence is directly to the contrary. In leveling this false charge, the Times has tried to impugn the integrity of Senator Cruz and of his publisher HarperCollins,\u201d Tyler said.\n\nToday\u2019s NYT *Bestseller List *A certain book was curiously omitted: https://t.co/Q0W2jMlZCT #ATimeForTruth pic.twitter.com/6pthBN1YZs \u2014 Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) July 12, 2015\n\nThe campaign added that Cruz has attracted large crowds to all of his book signing events.\n\nOn Sunday, the nation\u2019s largest bookseller, Amazon, also denied The New York Times\u2019 claim.\n\n\u201cAs of yesterday, \u2018A Time for Truth\u2019 was the number 13 bestselling book, and there is no evidence of unusual bulk purchase activity in our sales data,\u201d Sarah Gelman, Amazon\u2019s director of press relations, told Politico.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The New York Times has refused to include a book written by Sen.
