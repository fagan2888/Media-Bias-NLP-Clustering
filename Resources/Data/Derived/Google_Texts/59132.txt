The sun is shining — a rarity in Colorado these days, which is great for Commerce City’s 51st annual Memorial Day Parade, a must-be-seen gathering place for politicians even in a non-election year.

The parade, billed as one of the longest in the country, starts at 10 a.m. along a 1.5 mile parade route that begins at 64th Avenue/Newport Street and ends at 6060 E. Parkway Drive near the King Sooper’s. The parade lasts approximately two hours. Last year, there were 130 parade entries.

After the parade ends, the Reagan Club invites participants to relax with the “cool conservatives” for a BBQ in the grocery store parking lot. It costs $5 per person for two hot dogs or one hamburger, a bag of chips, potato salad, baked beans, a bottle of water and a cookie.

Parade highlights from earlier years: Democrat Congressman Ed Perlmutter cartwheeling his way down the street.
