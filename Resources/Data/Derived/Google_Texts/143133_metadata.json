But there are questions:\n\n\u25cfWould the inauguration of a new Democratic president change the behavior of recalcitrant hard-liners among the House Republicans, who have sought to block almost every major initiative from President Obama and whose tactics led to last year\u2019s government shutdown?\n\n\u25cfWould a Republican president be beholden to those hard-liners, or would he or she seize control of the conservative agenda to chart a different governing path?\n\n\u25cfBut above all, will the next president, whether Democrat or Republican, cultivate the kind of productive relationships with opposition-party leaders and others in Congress that Obama has failed to develop? Perhaps. But the reality is that deeper forces are at work that could well frustrate the hopes, aspirations and pledges of those who seek the presidency in 2016.\n\nThe U.S. Capitol and the Peace Monument in Washington. (J. Scott Applewhite/AP)\n\nIrreconcilable positions\n\nPersonalities matter, but structural rigidities also matter. The polarization of U.S. politics has been some years in the making and extends now from the behavior of elected officials in Washington to the general population of politically interested Americans across the country. Unraveling it will take more than good intentions.\n\nThe reality is that the two major political parties not only have strong differences about major issues, but because of the makeup of their coalitions, now approach the governing process in Washington from almost irreconcilable positions. And both claim a measure of public support for their approach.\n\nThe obstacles also include rising animus between politically engaged Republicans and Democrats, which has widened the gap between the two parties. Related to that, partisanship increasingly shapes perceptions of what\u2019s working and what\u2019s not, creating parallel rather than intersecting worldviews.\n\nThese are some of the conclusions from two papers presented at the recent American Political Science Association (APSA) meeting in Washington.\n\nAnyone who has watched Congress recently can see how Republican hard-liners in the House have changed the governing environment. Thomas E. Mann of the Brookings Institution and Norman J. Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute described this in their 2012 book, \u201cIt\u2019s Even Worse Than It Looks,\u201d as \u201casymmetric polarization\u201d \u2014 Democrats playing by traditional rules; Republicans playing by new and unconventional rules.\n\nMann and Ornstein, along with others, pin the blame for dysfunction on the GOP. Republicans point to Obama\u2019s policies and Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid\u2019s tactics as related causes of the gridlock, but it\u2019s been the arrival of tea party Republicans that changed the equation.\n\nIn their APSA paper, Matt Grossmann of Michigan State University and David A. Hopkins of Boston College looked at this issue of asymmetry by trying to explain not only why there is such a gap in the way Democrats and Republicans today approach governing and legislation, but also the prospects for a return to more comity and productivity.\n\nGrossmann and Hopkins write that Democrats represent a \u201ccoalition of social groups making specific programmatic demands on government.\u201d That provides incentives to Democratic elected officials to push for legislative and administrative actions that address societal problems and that \u201csimultaneously appease this diverse set of interests and appeal to the larger majority of the mass public.\u201d\n\nIn contrast, they say, today\u2019s Republican Party is dominated by small-government ideologues. Because the conservative base is \u201cskeptical that government action can ameliorate social problems,\u201d GOP elected officials \u201ctreat policymaking as a broader fight over the proper size and scope of government.\u201d\n\nThe result is that Democrats want to enact new programs, which Republicans see mostly as more liberal activism and a further expansion of government. Republican lawmakers are therefore content \u201cwith inaction or legislative gridlock.\u201d\n\nGrossmann and Hopkins argue that public opinion manages to reinforce each side, which encourages the current behavior.\n\nAs has been said before, the country is philosophically conservative and operationally liberal. A majority \u201cagrees with conservative preferences\u201d on the size and scope of government, the authors write, \u201ceven as it favors the liberal position on most specific issues.\u201d Legislatively, there\u2019s not much intersection between the two approaches.\n\nDemocrats tend to be united behind specific initiatives and therefore are more productive when they are in power. Republicans are under pressure by their electoral coalition \u201cto undertake symbolic acts\u201d that speak to their small-government philosophy (recall the many votes to repeal Obamacare that had no chance of being enacted) \u201crather than deliver legislative accomplishments to their constituencies.\u201d\n\nThere are political risks to both parties. Democrats\u2019 preference for legislative activism, the authors note, can produce a backlash against big government. Obama has certainly experienced the sting of that kind of reaction.\n\nBut Republicans have had little success in power rolling back what Democrats have done because they lack public support to eliminate or cut popular programs. Nor have Republicans found a way to satisfy public desire for Washington to address big problems without stirring up opposition in their base, as House GOP leaders have found repeatedly over the past few years.\n\n\u201cThe Republicans have been a more ideological party for decades and their ideology (limited government) is a difficult one for the leadership of a governing party,\u201d Grossman said in a follow-up e-mail message. That\u2019s why there have been few examples over the years of active, conservative governance.\n\nThey\u2019re the extremists\n\nMarc J. Hetherington of Vanderbilt University and Thomas J. Rudolph of the University of Illinois explore what they call \u201cthe polarization of trust\u201d as a major factor in the growing gap between the parties. They argue that polarization is not so much ideological \u2014 the two parties have long had philosophical differences \u2014 as it is pure partisanship that prevents greater consensus.\n\nThis partisanship is driven by conflicting views about government and harsher perceptions of the opposition. \u201cPeople are motivated to see their own positions as moderate and responsible,\u201d they write. \u201cIt is those on the other side who they would like to see as extreme.\u201d\n\nThis concept has drawn increasing attention recently. The Pew Research Center\u2019s large survey released this year talked about how extreme partisans see those in the other party in increasingly negative terms. Alan Abramowitz of Emory University has written about this as well in his work on polarization.\n\nHetherington and Rudolph draw a direct connection between these negative evaluations of the opposition with decreased trust in government by partisans on one side when their party is out of power. They cite one finding from 2010 in which 50 percent of self-identified Republicans said \u201cthey never trusted in the government in Washington to do the right thing. Never.\u201d\n\nPolitical elites make judgments about government\u2019s performance through a selective, partisan lens. During George W. Bush\u2019s presidency, when offered a choice of evaluating his government \u201con criteria helpful or harmful to the GOP,\u201d Democratic partisans focused on things that made Bush look bad; Republicans focused on those that made him look good. Objective facts need not apply.\n\n\u201cThe public did not create polarization in Washington,\u201d Hetherington and Rudolph say, \u201cbut it does allow it to persist.\u201d\n\nIf the prospective 2016 presidential candidates hope to make the system work better, they ought to be thinking now about what, if anything, they could do in office to change these realities \u2014 and whether they\u2019re prepared to buck their own parties to do so.
