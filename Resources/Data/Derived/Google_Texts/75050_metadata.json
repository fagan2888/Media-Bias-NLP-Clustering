We\u2019re looking at that day.\u201d\n\nThe Rockies on Friday whittled down their choices for a fourth starting pitcher by reassigning Jon Gray to the minor leagues and moving Christian Bergman into the bullpen.\n\nBergman will be on the Rockies opening-day roster when they start the season in Milwaukee on Monday, he said. But he will be there as a long-relief option.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be the bridge, if they need it,\u201d said Bergman, who will pitch two innings behind Jordan Lyles on Friday night against the Mariners in Peoria. That leaves Butler as the leading option for the Rockies\u2019 starting spot Wednesday against the Brewers.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re expecting him to get relatively deep into the game,\u201d Weiss said.\n\nButler thought he was pitching Friday, but found out the plan changed when he arrived at the clubhouse.\n\n\u201cThat was a little puzzling,\u201d he said.\n\nButler was pulled from his previous start on Monday after one inning with shoulder fatigue. But he made a quick recovery and was throwing long-toss by Wednesday.\n\nThe Rockies can start the season with four pitchers in their rotation and use an off-day Thursday to give everyone regular rest. No. 1 starter Jorge De La Rosa is recovering from a groin injury and won\u2019t be ready to start the season.\n\nWith De La Rosa likely headed to the disabled list, Butler and Bergman would give the Rockies a full 25-man roster.\n\nNick Groke: ngroke@denverpost.com or twitter.com/nickgroke", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Eddie Butler pitching for the Rockies\u2019 final spot; Christian Bergman to bullpen", "title": "Eddie Butler pitching for the Rockies\u2019 final spot; Christian Bergman to bullpen", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/04/03/eddie-butler-pitching-for-the-rockies-final-spot-christian-bergman-to-bullpen/", "image": {"width": 653, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150402__christian-bergmanp1.jpg", "height": 653}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150402__christian-bergmanp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-03T15:26:50+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-25T11:10:45+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddf4d\"", "article_summary": "That leaves Butler as the leading option for the Rockies\u2019 starting spot Wednesday against the Brewers.\nWith De La Rosa likely headed to the disabled list, Butler and Bergman would give the Rockies a full 25-man roster.\n\u201cWe\u2019re expecting him to get relatively deep into the game,\u201d Weiss said.\nBergman will be on the Rockies opening-day roster when they start the season in Milwaukee on Monday, he said.\nIf he does well, Butler will start Wednesday at Milwaukee in Game 3 of Colorado\u2019s season-opening series."}
