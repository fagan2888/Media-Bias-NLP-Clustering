Marco Rubio and Ohio Gov. John Kasich. Cruz earned roughly half the vote in Kansas, which he said was further proof that he\u2019s the only Republican candidate who can derail Trump\u2019s path to the GOP nomination.\n\n\u201cOur campaign is the only campaign that has beaten Donald Trump over and over and over again, and will beat Donald Trump over and over and over again,\u201d Cruz, clad in jeans, boots, a suit jacket and no tie, told the boisterous crowd of roughly 1,600 people that filled the Jacklin Building on Saturday afternoon. Organizers said another 1,500 people watched outside, and Cruz returned to the stage after his speech to thank them.\n\nIn a speech punctuated by attacks on both Trump and the policies of President Barack Obama, Cruz criticized what he called efforts to stifle economic growth. He promised to \u201crepeal every word\u201d of the Affordable Care Act if elected and to be tougher on America\u2019s enemies. He said he would follow Obama in the same way Ronald Reagan followed Jimmy Carter, by passing tax reforms and using that money to strengthen the military that was used to bankrupt and defeat the Soviet Union.\n\n\u201cI intend to do the exact same thing with radical Islam,\u201d Cruz said, to cheers from the assembled audience.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to weaken, we\u2019re not going to degrade,\u201d Cruz continued. \u201cWe will utterly destroy ISIS.\u201d\n\nBefore the senator\u2019s speech, Cruz supporters raised umbrellas and huddled together for warmth as rain soaked the fairgrounds. Many of them described Cruz as a more diplomatic alternative to Trump. Cruz has shored up the endorsement of U.S. Rep. Raul Labrador, R-Eagle, who did not appear Saturday due to other engagements. Gov. Butch Otter has endorsed Kasich.\n\n\u201cHe seems more reasonable than all the other candidates,\u201d said Coeur d\u2019Alene resident Skyler Borders, who arrived more than an hour before the doors opened to wait in the rain with his mother, Candice. Candice Borders took a day off work at Macy\u2019s to attend the rally.\n\n\u201cIt almost \u2013 you don\u2019t want to say it \u2013 but it is the lesser of two evils, which is a shame, because I don\u2019t think politics was ever meant to be that,\u201d said Candice Borders, who said her support of a Republican candidate was fueled in part by her desire not to see Hillary Clinton as president.\n\nThe Borderses said they supported Cruz\u2019s positions on immigration, echoing the opinions of several who waited in line for the senator. Kerry Field, a military veteran and New Zealand native, wrapped his arm around his wife, Nedda, as the pair awaited the start of the event. Kerry Field, who filed for the draft when he immigrated, said Trump\u2019s positions on immigration \u2013 specifically his call for a wall to be built on the border with Mexico and deportation for those in the country illegally \u2013 were unrealistic.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think what Trump is saying is going to work,\u201d Field said. \u201cHe\u2019s not had the experience, working with Congress in that sense. You\u2019ve got to let people in here legally.\u201d\n\nNedda Field, who is part Cuban and once lived on the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, said she supported Cruz\u2019s hard stance on keeping the detention center for suspected terrorists open in spite of President Barack Obama\u2019s announced plans to shutter it. She also called Trump \u201cunstable.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need somebody who\u2019s going to give a lot of thought before he relays what he\u2019s thinking,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re Cruz supporters.\u201d\n\nA little farther forward in line, married couple Frank and Shirley James clutched the same umbrella they brought from Bonner County. Frank James described himself as \u201can old military guy,\u201d and he too questioned Trump\u2019s boisterous appearances at the televised Republican debates.\n\n\u201cA leader doesn\u2019t do that,\u201d Frank James said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t lower himself to the muck. All my leaders could stand in the middle of a muddy field, and their boots could still be shining.\u201d\n\nShirley James praised Cruz\u2019s legal acumen as a former U.S. Supreme Court clerk.\n\n\u201cI think that he\u2019s intelligent, he\u2019s really smart, and I like that,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I honestly think he has the country\u2019s best interests at heart.\u201d\n\nThe Jameses, Fields and Borderses all said they wanted to hear about Cruz\u2019s policies, rather than attacks on the other candidates.\n\nInstead of attacking the remaining candidates, Cruz said he would welcome their supporters to join his campaign and defeat Trump.\n\n\u201cIf we stand united, that\u2019s how we win this primary, it\u2019s how we win the general, it\u2019s how we turn the country around,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republican presidential hopeful Ted Cruz took a victory lap Saturday in front of hundreds of Inland Northwest voters and pleaded with those supporting other candidates to unite against frontrunner Donald Trump. \u201cIf Donald is our nominee, in all likelihood we lose to Hillary Clinton, we lose the U.S. Senate, we lose the Supreme Court for a generation, we lose the Bill of Rights, we lose the future of our kids,\u201d said Cruz, appearing at the Kootenai County Fairgrounds on a whirlwind stop through Idaho.", "og": {"site_name": "Spokesman.com", "description": "Republican presidential hopeful Ted Cruz took a victory lap Saturday in front of hundreds of Inland Northwest voters and pleaded with those supporting other candidates to unite against frontrunner Donald Trump. \u201cIf Donald is our nominee, in all likelihood we lose to Hillary Clinton, we lose the U.S. Senate, we lose the Supreme Court for a generation, we lose the Bill of Rights, we lose the future of our kids,\u201d said Cruz, appearing at the Kootenai County Fairgrounds on a whirlwind stop through Idaho.", "title": "Ted Cruz draws more than 3,000 to Coeur d\u2019Alene rally", "url": "http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2016/mar/05/cruz-rallies-hundreds-in-coeur-dalene/", "image": "https://media.spokesman.com/img/logos/sr200.png", "updated_time": "2016-03-05T23:32:15.962292", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image1": "http://media.spokesman.com/photos/2016/03/05/srx_Cruz_2_.JPG_t1200.jpg?298603a24e8d51915fce203907ff2746e482a5a6", "site": "@SpokesmanReview", "card": "gallery"}, "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"app_id": 316254480466}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes", "googlebot": "index, follow"}, "article_summary": "Republican presidential hopeful Ted Cruz took a victory lap Saturday in front of hundreds of Inland Northwest voters and pleaded with those supporting other candidates to unite against front-runner Donald Trump.\n\u201cI think that he\u2019s intelligent, he\u2019s really smart, and I like that,\u201d she said.\nInstead of attacking the remaining candidates, Cruz said he would welcome their supporters to join his campaign and defeat Trump.\nOrganizers said another 1,500 people watched outside, and Cruz returned to the stage after his speech to thank them.\n\u201cI intend to do the exact same thing with radical Islam,\u201d Cruz said, to cheers from the assembled audience."}
