Luiz Lopez is the owner of Emerson Biggins. He says that he already has to pay the sin tax when he purchases the liquor for his bars; if the tax goes up, he will have no choice but to either increase prices or reduce drink sizes.\n\n\"The $2.50 special, the $3.00 special, the two-for-ones, a lot of that stuff, that is going to have to change, because I need to get this extra money from somewhere to pay for my tax bills,\" Lopez said.\n\nBar-goer Shelley Kuhn would rather see a small increase to sales tax across the state than isolate a tax for smokers and drinkers.\n\n\"I think they would do a much better job if they would just increase the sales tax that would affect everyone,\" Kuhn said, \"why pick on the people that drink and smoke.\"\n\nThere are many proposals for closing the budget deficit.
