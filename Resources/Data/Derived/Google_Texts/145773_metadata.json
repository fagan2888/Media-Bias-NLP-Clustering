The program, sponsored by the Adolph Coors Foundation, awarded each honoree a $1,000 scholarship. The program also honors a faculty or staff member at a tribal college and university for their leadership.\n\nMichael \u201cMickey\u201d Parish, president and CEO of Bay Mills Community College, received the Tribal College Leader award. Parish has been the president of the institution, located in Brimley, Michigan and serving the Bay Mills Indian Community, for 13 years.\n\nParish is a homegrown leader. Tribal members saw his potential and asked him to consider attending law school after he completed a bachelor\u2019s degree. With the added encouragement from his wife, he enrolled and later became an attorney, working in areas such as child welfare, land claims, and prosecution. Parish went on to serve in tribal government for many years as a member of their Executive Council. From there he made the leap into higher education.\n\nParish\u2019s goal is to ensure the tribal college benefits his tribal members. He says he takes pride in seeing how well the tribal college students do when they transfer to other institutions from the tribal college, including his granddaughter, who was named the school\u2019s Student of the Year in 2014 and now attends Lake Superior State College, where she maintains a 4.0 grade point average. They use the school as a springboard for future success.\n\n\u201cMany of our students are non-traditional in that they are older, with families, and they work while they go to school part-time, so they do not always finish in two to three years. But when they finish they are proud and we are just as proud of them. That makes it all worth it,\u201d Parish said.\n\nThanks to Parish, Bay Mills Community College is also a leader in Michigan education. Bay Mills Community College is the only tribal college authorized by state law to charter public school academies. BMCC presently has 42 chartered academies serving over 22,000 students throughout the State of Michigan. As part of this work, Parish says student retention is a necessary focus.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a lot of sixth, seventh, and eighth grade students dropping out of school. We try to identify programs and activities to retain these students. Although there is no magic bullet, smaller classrooms, closer teacher interactions, and making the schools a safe environment keeps them in school,\u201d he says.\n\nPoverty is a major contributor to students dropping out, and Parish says the government does not always look at the conditions that students are living in. Often children in a family do not have money for school supplies or clothing, making consistent attendance difficult for them and leading to them falling behind.\n\nThe 2014-2015 Adolph Coors Foundation Students of the Year are:\n\nCharmayne Healy\u2014Aaniiih Nakoda College\n\nAudie Petrosky Jr.\u2014Bay Mills Community College\n\nBurton Butterfly\u2014Blackfeet Community College\n\nMarshall Longie Jr.\u2014Cankdeska Cikana Community College\n\nDanielle Freemont\u2014Chief Dull Knife College\n\nElizabeth Rice\u2014College of Menominee Nation\n\nCarmon Rudd\u2014College of the Muscogee Nation\n\nDallas Peterman\u2014Din\u00e9 College\n\nAlisha Smith\u2014Fond du Lac Tribal & Community College\n\nConnie Greene\u2014Fort Berthold Community College\n\nCarolyn Bigby\u2014Fort Peck Community College\n\nBeverly Foley\u2014Haskell Indian Nations University\n\nMatthew Murray\u2014Ilisagvik College\n\nTerran Kipp\u2014Institute of American Indian Arts\n\nHeather Maki\u2014Keweenaw Bay Ojibwa Community College\n\nJodee LaFave\u2014Lac Courte Oreilles Ojibwa Community College\n\nAudrianna Goodwin\u2014Leech Lake Tribal College\n\nShereena Old Elk\u2014Little Big Horn College\n\nWayne Vandall\u2014Little Priest Tribal College\n\nMyrna Mitchell\u2014Navajo Technical University\n\nSarah Zavala\u2014Nebraska Indian Community College\n\nSean Lawrence\u2014Northwest Indian College\n\nLacey Thompson\u2014Oglala Lakota College\n\nAnthony Quiroga\u2014Saginaw Chippewa Tribal College\n\nStormie Perdash\u2014Salish Kootenai College\n\nRoger Ellert Jr.\u2014Sinte Gleska University\n\nMelanie Seaboy\u2014Sisseton Wahpeton College\n\nJody Wingate\u2014Sitting Bull College\n\nJoVonna Rosetta\u2014Southwestern Indian Polytechnic Institute\n\nIna Fox\u2014Stone Child College\n\nErvin Francisco\u2014Tohono O'odham Community College\n\nCole Frederick\u2014Turtle Mountain Community College\n\nLogan Maxon\u2014United Tribes Technical College\n\nIsabella Griffin\u2014White Earth Tribal and Community College", "article_metadata": {"description": "The president of Bay Mills Community College, and Students of the Year from all tribal colleges were recently honored by the College Fund and Coors.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "leeanne", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/03/18/tribal-college-president-and-students-honored-159650", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/bay-mills-community-college.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Tribal College President and Students Honored"}, "abstract": "The president of Bay Mills Community College, and Students of the Year from all tribal colleges were recently honored by the College Fund and Coors.", "dc": {"title": "Tribal College President and Students Honored"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/03/18/tribal-college-president-and-students-honored-159650", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "American Indian College Fund, Native American students, Adolph Coors Foundation, Native American Scholarships, Tribal Colleges", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.date": "2015-03-18T14:20-04:00", "dcterms.title": "Tribal College President and Students Honored"}, "article_summary": "Michael \u201cMickey\u201d Parish, president and CEO of Bay Mills Community College, received the Tribal College Leader award.\nBay Mills Community College is the only tribal college authorized by state law to charter public school academies.\nParish\u2019s goal is to ensure the tribal college benefits his tribal members.\nThe program also honors a faculty or staff member at a tribal college and university for their leadership.\nThanks to Parish, Bay Mills Community College is also a leader in Michigan education."}
