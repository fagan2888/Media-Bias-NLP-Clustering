He discusses his 11 years in the real estate business in this edited interview.\n\nWhat is it you enjoy about selling real estate?\n\nWorking with different people and the different dynamics of each transaction. There is really no monotony in the business. Every day is different, every transaction is different. You\u2019re dealing with different challenges every day.\n\nWhat do you believe makes you different from other agents?\n\nI consider myself to be more of a real estate consultant than a sales person. It\u2019s my opinion that houses sell themselves; what is needed is a good, ethical professional to guide people through the process. When I see others out there who are more sales focused and only about closing the transaction as opposed to putting their clients\u2019 needs first, it reinforces that my approach is more appropriate.\n\nWhat role do you believe a realtor should play for a client?\n\nObviously they should play the role of advocate for the person they\u2019re representing, whether it\u2019s a buyer or a seller. We really try to work as counselors through the entire process because, I believe, it\u2019s much like a marriage from the start of the transaction through the end of it. Whether it\u2019s a first-time buyer or someone who\u2019s lived in a home for 40 years, it\u2019s a new experience for each individual, and having someone there to walk them through the process helps them avoid as many complications as possible.\n\nWhat qualities make for a good realtor?\n\nBeing patient, a good listener and knowledgeable--and I really need to stress, ethical. They also need to put the clients\u2019 needs ahead of their own. Additionally, it\u2019s important for all agents to have a certain level of expertise as far as homes and their mechanical components and potential repair items so they can talk in an educated manner about the homes they take buyers through or help prep sellers for various items that may come up during the sale. By that, I mean items such as whether a roof is at the end of its life expectancy or is brand-new. Plus, that includes things like the quality of windows, the plumbing and electrical.\n\nWhat is your philosophy of selling real estate?\n\nAgain, houses sell themselves; I\u2019m just there to help them navigate through the process. I\u2019m helpful in laying out the pros and cons of each property, but at the end of the day, the buyer or seller is in the driver\u2019s seat and we just help guide them based on our past experience.\n\nHow have you developed as a realtor?\n\nSince I\u2019ve entered the business, it\u2019s been a roller coaster market. When I started at the age of 24, I was working primarily with first-time buyers looking at entry-level housing. Today, I\u2019m working more with sellers who bought their first home with me and now have families and are moving on to buy their second or third houses.\n\nHave you had any mentors?\n\nWith Shorewest Realtors, there is kind of a family attitude that goes along with the company. Rick Bohmann is our office manager and, given that I came into the business as young as I did, he helped me for the first few years getting my feet wet. Also I really can\u2019t say enough about the Horning family, Joe and John Paul. They really make you feel like an individual, not a number.\n\nWhat\u2019s been the best advice you\u2019ve been given?\n\nThat I\u2019m in the business of making good, long-lasting relationships and not in the business of selling houses, and that if you treat people as you want to be treated, it will pay you back ten-fold in the future.\n\nWhat do you do for recreation or to relax?\n\nI have a wife and three children under the age of six. We find plenty to keep us busy, whether it\u2019s going to the park or the zoo or playing around the house. When my downtime isn\u2019t focused on my family, I enjoy golfing and going to the gym.\n\nWhat charitable groups are you involved with?\n\nWe donate to the Boy\u2019s and Girl\u2019s Club. We also participate at our church, St. Anthony\u2019s Parish in Milwaukee.", "article_metadata": {"title": "Kevin Rigg, Shorewest Realtors", "og": {"url": "http://www.jsonline.com/homes/realtoroftheweek/264001211.html", "image": {"width": 300, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/RiggKevin.jpg", "height": 500}, "type": "article", "description": "While working as a personal trainer at the YMCA as a young man, Kevin Rigg discovered he really enjoyed working with people.
