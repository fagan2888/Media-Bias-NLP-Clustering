John Kasich for embracing the Affordable Care Act Monday, singling the potential Republican 2016 White House candidate out at a White House event with the National Governors Association.\n\n\"Today, thanks to the Affordable Care Act, more than 10 million Americans now have the peace of mind that comes with being covered,\" Obama said. \"I want to thank all the governors, Democrats and Republicans, supporters and some opponents of the ACA who have expanded Medicaid to millions of people over the past two years. I think there\u2019s a recognition that it makes sense, and it\u2019s bigger than politics. As Governor Kasich said for Ohio, 'It saves lives. No question about it.' And if your state isn\u2019t one of the 28 that has already expanded Medicaid, I\u2019d urge you to consider it, because our team is prepared to work with you to make it happen.\"\n\nKasich said he opposed Obama's Medicaid expansion in 2010 when he first ran for governor. But Kasich has since evolved on the issue, and he now claims his Christian faith dictates he accept bigger government.\n\n\u201cNow, if you ever read Matthew 25,\u201d Kasich said while promoting a Balanced Budget Amendment in South Dakota, \u201cI think, \u2018I wanna feed the hungry and clothe the naked,\u2019 and I have to tell you \u2014 I read a horrible story in The Wall Street Journal on the weekend about people, one man in particular freezing to death over in Montana. And they\u2019ve turned down about half a billion dollars of help, I\u2019m told. That disturbs me.\u201d\n\nMontana is indeed one of the 22 states that have still not embraced Obama's Medicaid expansion, as is South Dakota. But it is not at all clear that Medicaid enrollment guarantees any access to actual health care. Full federal funding for Medicaid reimbursements ran out in 2014, and in 2015 Medicaid reimbursements fell sharply by an average of 43 percent in all states, and by 45 percent in Ohio.\n\nIn California, where almost a third of residents will soon be on Medicaid, patients can not get doctors to see them and are having to pay for their own medical care despite their supposed Medicaid coverage.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Kasich gets a special shout out from Obama at the National Governors Association meeting..05/26/2016 18:17:41PM EST.", "author": "Conn Carroll", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Kasich gets a special shout out from Obama at the National Governors Association meeting.", "title": "- President Obama Thanks Ohio Gov.
