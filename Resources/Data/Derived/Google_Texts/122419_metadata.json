I was laid off right before open enrollment ended, and now do not have any income/insurance. Am I still required to sign up for insurance by the end of open enrollment? What if I can\u2019t afford it? I am looking for a new job, but it is going to take some time. What happens when I do get a job and receive health benefits again?\n\nA: Losing your insurance because you were laid off counts as a qualifying event, so your open enrollment goes for 60 days from the date your old policy ended. If you want to purchase a new ACA-compliant plan, you\u2019ll need to complete your enrollment within that time frame.\n\nIf your income remains low and you can\u2019t afford coverage, you could qualify for a hardship exemption from the individual mandate, which would mean that you would not have to pay a penalty for remaining uninsured. In addition, you\u2019re allowed to go two months without health insurance before the individual mandate penalty applies, so if you find a job that provides health insurance and you had a gap in coverage that lasted less than three months, you won\u2019t owe a penalty regardless of your income.\n\nMedicaid may be an option for you, depending on where you live. If you\u2019re in a state that has expanded Medicaid, coverage is available if your income is under 138 percent of poverty level. If your state has not expanded Medicaid, eligibility is significantly more restricted. (Here are Medicaid eligibility guidelines for each state.)\n\nContact your state Medicaid office or the exchange to see if you could qualify for Medicaid until you get another job.\n\nIf you\u2019re in the coverage gap because you\u2019re in a state that hasn\u2019t expanded Medicaid, you\u2019ll have an opportunity to enroll in a subsidized health insurance plan through the exchange later in the year if you find a job that puts your income at or above the poverty level (assuming the job doesn\u2019t come with health insurance and you need to purchase your own coverage). This is a new change that took effect in 2015.\n\nNormally, a change in income does not count as a qualifying event. But for people who are in states that haven\u2019t expanded Medicaid and are ineligible for Medicaid or premium subsidies because their income is below the poverty level, HHS made an exception to the rule. As of 2015, people in that situation are allowed to enroll in a subsidized exchange plan as soon as their income reaches 100 percent of the poverty level, regardless of when that happens during the year.\n\nIf you\u2019re unable to afford an ACA-qualified plan while you\u2019re between jobs, you might want to consider a short-term health insurance plan. These temporary health insurance plans are not regulated by the ACA, so they still use underwriting, don\u2019t cover pre-existing conditions, cap benefits, don\u2019t have to cover preventive care, etc. But they\u2019re better than nothing and they\u2019re far less expensive than an ACA-qualified plan. Short-term plans don\u2019t meet the individual mandate requirements, but if you qualify for a hardship exemption, you wouldn\u2019t be required to pay a penalty for having a plan that isn\u2019t ACA-compliant.\n\nIf you get coverage on your own \u2013 either Medicaid or a private plan \u2013 and then get a new job that provides health insurance benefits, you\u2019ll be able to cancel the interim insurance and switch to your employer\u2019s plan once you\u2019re eligible for coverage.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Q.
