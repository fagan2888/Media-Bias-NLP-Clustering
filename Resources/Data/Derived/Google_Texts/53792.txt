Seriously. Could there be a more perfect sign? As Twitchy reported, attendees of the Million Veterans March in Washington, D.C. on Sunday tore down Barrycades at memorials. They then transported them to the Spite House, where they peaceably assembled in protest.

That sign put the icing on the awesome civil disobedience cake.
