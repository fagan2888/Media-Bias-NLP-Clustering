I see Leonard Lance's actions and his record as the embodiment of a perpetual, feckless establishment politician who will bend the truth, his knowledge and past votes to win the next election.\n\nSince graduating law school in 1977, Lance has been a public employee 38 years! He collects a state pension in addition to a congressional salary of $174,000, and has a congressional pension and medical plan for life and is exempt from Obamacare.\n\nLance's public service has been very lucrative. According to OpenSecrets.org Lance's 2015 net worth is estimated at $3.7 million. How did he become worth so much on a public servant's wage? What has he done as a state legislator or congressman to fix double-dippers and the mindset of \"elected office is a career?\"\n\nHe espouses his experience and legislative abilities, yet according to InsideGov.com he is ranked fifth least effective out of 435 House members! Every first-term member of Congress each is ranked higher than Lance. How does Lance reconcile this lack of value-for-the voter with his \"fiscal conservatism\"?\n\nLarsen promotes a smaller, less-regulated, more effective government. He has been consistent and respectful in his statements, thoughtful and explanatory of his values, is fiscally responsible in his decision-making and, as most successful business-owners live and prove to be, practices compromise based on principled beliefs. If you live in the 7th District, which includes parts of Hunterdon and Warren counties, I ask that you vote for him as well.\n\nRobert Becker\n\nTewksbury District Three Representative\n\nHunterdon County Republican Committee", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Leonard Lance, letters to the editor, opinion", "title": "Larsen the better candidate in N.J. 7th District | Letter", "og": {"site_name": "lehighvalleylive.com", "description": "David LarsenCourtesy photo &nbsp; I am supporting Dave Larsen for Congress in New Jersey's 7th District.
