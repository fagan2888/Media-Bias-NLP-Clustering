California's Obamacare marketplace this enrollment season saw the largest four insurers lose a chunk of their combined market share to smaller competitors, as consumers appeared sensitive to price differences for health coverage.

Last year on the Covered California exchange, which sells private Obamacare health insurance plans, four major insurers captured almost 95 percent of all sign-ups by customers.

But in the recently concluded third Obamacare enrollment season, those four carriers ended up with 90 percent of sign-ups, Covered California revealed Wednesday.

And the big four garnered a lower share of new customers â€” 83 percent of the newbies, an 11 percentage point decrease from last year, officials said.
