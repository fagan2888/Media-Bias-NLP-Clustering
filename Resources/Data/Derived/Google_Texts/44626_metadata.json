We have a decision to make whether we\u2019re going to move ahead together or build walls instead of bridges.\u201d\n\nAmong those listed as being targets of Trump were women, Muslims, the disabled, Great Britain and two Republicans, Sen. John McCain and New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez.\n\n\u201cHe is scapegoating everyone,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s good for reality TV. But you\u2019ve got to work with people.\u201d\n\nClinton\u2019s California visits come as rival candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders is barnstorming the state \u2013 including two Orange County visits in the past five days \u2013 as he pushes for a strong June 7 primary showing.\n\nAnalysts say it\u2019s virtually impossible for Sanders to catch Clinton in the delegate race, but Sanders believes a strong showing in the remaining states will give him the leverage to woo superdelegates who have previously indicated support for Clinton.\n\nSome California polls have shown Clinton with a double-digit lead over the Vermont senator, but a Public Policy Institute of California survey released Wednesday evening showed the two neck and neck in the state. In polling of likely Democratic voters and independents who planned to vote in the Democratic primary, Clinton led Sanders 46 percent to 44 percent.\n\nComparing Clinton, Sanders\n\nClinton, who was introduced by actress Jamie Lee Curtis, did not attack \u2013 or even directly mention \u2013 Sanders in her 35-minute speech. But her platform displayed more similarities than differences between the two.\n\nClinton and Sanders share proposals for large-scale public works program to rebuild the country\u2019s infrastructure and put more people to work. Both want a path to citizenship for those living here illegally.\n\nBoth want more attention to mental health and addiction problems. But though Clinton wants to improve Obamacare, Sanders wants Medicare for all Americans.\n\nThough Sanders has called for tuition-free public colleges and universities, Clinton will push for tuition-free community colleges and tax credits for unions that have training programs.\n\nShe also touted her own experience as secretary of state and called for a massive project to power all homes with renewable energy within eight years.\n\nBut her shots at Trump sparked the strongest response from the crowd Wednesday.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump has put forth an economic plan by billionaires, for billionaires,\u201d she said.\n\nThe crowd responded with boos.\n\nShe also reiterated her attack on Trump\u2019s comments suggesting that he sought to profit from the housing crash. He defended those comments Tuesday, saying it\u2019s \u201cthe kind of thinking our country needs, understanding how to get a good result out of a very bad and sad situation.\"\n\nIn the crowd\n\nJohn Nelson and Dan Stifler, both 32, found standing-room spots near the speaker dais and took their shirts off, prompting Clinton to say she would keep her eyes elsewhere.\n\nAfterward, they called Clinton \u201cthe perfect candidate.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d have to be stoned to believe Bernie Sanders,\u201d Nelson said.\n\nOthers agreed with Nelson\u2019s and Stifler\u2019s assessment of Clinton and their skepticism of Sanders.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s the most qualified person who has ever run for this office, her husband included,\u201d said Santa Ana\u2019s Mark Wagner, 57. \u201cI don\u2019t think half of the stuff (Sanders) talks about can get done. (Barack) Obama had the same problem.\u201d\n\nLaguna Beach\u2019s Barbara McMurray, a marketing consultant, voted for Obama in 2008 but is siding with Clinton this time.\n\n\u201cI felt like she had to get the secretary of state job under her belt,\u201d said McMurray, 56. \u201cShe did that job and did it well.\u201d\n\nShe said she liked Sanders but was growing frustrated with him for remaining in the race long after he appeared to have a chance at the nomination.\n\n\u201cI like everything that he says but when you drill down, there doesn\u2019t seem to be a lot of detail of how he\u2019s going to do the things he wants, like breaking up the banks,\u201d she said, adding that she was optimistic that the party eventually would unify behind a single candidate.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t, we\u2019re going to have much bigger problems,\u201d she said.\n\nIf Clinton and Trump are the nominees, it will be a matchup between the two most unpopular candidates in the history of ABC/Washington Post election polls, dating back to 1984.\n\nAn ABC-Post poll released Sunday showed 53 percent of Americans view Clinton unfavorably and 60 percent view Trump unfavorably.", "article_metadata": {"geo.placename": "Santa Ana", "geo.region": "US-CA", "content_section": "news", "description": "News: Hillary Clinton tells O.C.: 'Trump is a divider, not a uniter'; poll shows she's neck and neck with Bernie Sanders | clinton, percent, sanders, california, trump, democratic, supporters, win,", "geo.position": "33.745573;-117.867834", "author": "MARTIN WISCKOL", "og": {"site_name": "The Orange County Register", "description": "BUENA PARK \u2013 On the second day of a four-day swing through California, Hillary Clinton took the stage at a Buena Park union hall and focused attacks on presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump.", "title": "Clinton tells O.C.: 'Trump is a divider, not a uniter'; poll shows she's neck and neck with Bernie", "url": "http://www.ocregister.com/articles/clinton-717093-percent-sanders.html", "image": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/ocregister/gallery/o7r2td-b88719909z.120160525133902000gkcgp6tm.10.jpg", "locale": "en-US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ocregister", "image": {"src": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/ocregister/gallery/o7r2td-b88719909z.120160525133902000gkcgp6tm.10.jpg"}, "description": "BUENA PARK \u2013 On the second day of a four-day swing through California, Hillary Clinton took the stage at a Buena Park union hall and focused attacks on presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Clinton tells O.C.: 'Trump is a divider, not a uniter'; poll shows she's neck and neck with Bernie"}, "content_author": "MARTIN WISCKOL", "fb": {"app_id": 107698536003308}, "content_thumbnail": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/ocregister/thumb/o7r2td-b88719909z.120160525133902000gkcgp6tm.10.jpg", "content_type": "article", "ICBM": "33.745573, -117.867834", "Keywords": "clinton, percent, sanders, california, trump, democratic, supporters, win, wagner, primary", "publication_date": "2016-05-25", "access-type": "paid", "section": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "content_title": "Clinton tells O.C.: 'Trump is a divider, not a uniter'; poll shows she's neck and neck with Bernie"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccd6b\"", "article_summary": "But though Clinton wants to improve Obamacare, Sanders wants Medicare for all Americans.\nAn ABC-Post poll released Sunday showed 53 percent of Americans view Clinton unfavorably and 60 percent view Trump unfavorably.\nClinton and Sanders share proposals for large-scale public works program to rebuild the country\u2019s infrastructure and put more people to work.\nIn polling of likely Democratic voters and independents who planned to vote in the Democratic primary, Clinton led Sanders 46 percent to 44 percent.\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot of evidence that Donald Trump is a divider, not a uniter."}
