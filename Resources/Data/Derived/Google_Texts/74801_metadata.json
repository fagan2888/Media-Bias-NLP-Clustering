In other words, dos work better than don\u2019ts.\n\nRelated: Could Probiotics Help with the Terrible Twos?\n\nThe researchers \u2014 David R. Just, professor in the Charles H. Dyson School of Applied Economics and Management at Cornell University and Andrew S. Hanks, assistant professor in the Department of Human Sciences at Ohio State University \u2014 analyzed outcomes of past nutrition-focused public policies. Not surprisingly, they found the policies that were framed in positive terms and supported a person\u2019s freedom of choice were more successful than those framed in negative terms.\n\nHere\u2019s an example: One study involved 173 adults making lunch selections with varying pricing characteristics. When price differences were described as taxations on unhealthy choices, people tended to choose those unhealthy items anyway. But when differences were framed positively \u2014 as discounts for making healthier choices \u2014 people were more likely to choose the healthy items over unhealthy ones.\n\nThis research underscores the importance of emotion in influencing behaviors. When consumers are faced with policies that make them feel attacked or restricted, they react with resistance, while in the face of policies that validate consumers positively, they react in kind to make the desired (better) choices. This information has the potential to help educators and policy-makers develop more successful, cost-effective approaches to influencing health behaviors.\n\nIt might also make you reconsider how you teach your children to make healthier choices.
