Colyer's research became an invaluable part of his 1936 book on dental diseases of captive animals.\n\n\u00a9 LAKANA", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://sharedmedia.grahamdigital.com/photo/2015/11/20/Pooh-skull-jpg_485129_ver1.0_160_90.jpg", "description": "Fans of the adorable golden bear with an insatiable appetite for honey are in for a dose of reality.
