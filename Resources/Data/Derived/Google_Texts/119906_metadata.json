Nick Rahall Nick RahallWest Virginia is no longer Clinton country Solution needed: Rail congestion is stifling economic growth Lobbying World MORE\u2019s (D) nearly four-decade run representing southern West Virginia came to a halt Tuesday when he lost a tough reelection battle against a state lawmaker.\n\nThe Associated Press called the race at about 10 p.m. with 82 percent of precincts reporting. Republican Evan Jenkins had 55.1 percent of the vote to Rahall\u2019s 44.9 percent.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe race for West Virginia\u2019s 3rd Congressional District was one of the most watched of the election cycle, pitting two centrists against each other and giving Republicans a chance to kick out a congressional stalwart and gain a seat.\n\nThe district\u2019s deep ties to the coal industry played an important role in the race, with Jenkins repeatedly tying Rahall to President Obama\u2019s environmental policies, which the Republican argues hurt coal workers.\n\nRahall bet on his defense of coal miners\u2019 working conditions and benefits, and he accused Jenkins of supporting policies that would cut black lung disease benefits for miners.\n\nRahall also tried to distance himself from Obama\u2019s policies and use his long record of support for the coal industry to his advantage.\n\nRahall accused Jenkins throughout the campaign of being soft on coal-miner protections and being largely supported by out-of-state groups tied to billionaire conservative activists Charles and David Koch. He also called attention to Jenkins's history as a Democrat in West Virginia\u2019s Legislature, where he switched to the Republican Party to run against Rahall.\n\nThe Democrat stayed in Congress despite the increasingly conservative lean of his district, but he could not weather Jenkins's challenge.\n\nRahall was the top Democrat on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, where he supported increased infrastructure funding.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Republican Evan Jenkins ends Rahall's run, which began with his election in 1976.", "description": "Republican Evan Jenkins ends Rahall's run, which began with his election in 1976.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Ballot Box"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Republican Evan Jenkins ends Rahall's run, which began with his election in 1976.", "title": "Dem Rahall loses House seat after 38 years", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/house-races/222908-rahall-loses-house-seat-in-west-virginia", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-11-04T23:01:26-05:00", "type": "article"}, "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2014-11-04T23:01-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/house-races/222908-rahall-loses-house-seat-in-west-virginia", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2014-11-04T22:07-05:00", "dcterms.creator": "Timothy Cama", "author": "Timothy Cama", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-04T22:07:16-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-04T23:01:26-05:00"}, "keywords": "2014 midterms,Nick Rahall, Evan Jenkins,", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/house-races/222908-rahall-loses-house-seat-in-west-virginia", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Republican Evan Jenkins ends Rahall's run, which began with his election in 1976.", "card": "summary", "title": "Dem Rahall loses House seat after 38 years"}, "dcterms.title": "Dem Rahall loses House seat after 38 years"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf13c\"", "article_summary": "Rahall was the top Democrat on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, where he supported increased infrastructure funding.\nHe also called attention to Jenkins's history as a Democrat in West Virginia\u2019s Legislature, where he switched to the Republican Party to run against Rahall.\nRahall also tried to distance himself from Obama\u2019s policies and use his long record of support for the coal industry to his advantage.\nThe Democrat stayed in Congress despite the increasingly conservative lean of his district, but he could not weather Jenkins's challenge.\nRepublican Evan Jenkins had 55.1 percent of the vote to Rahall\u2019s 44.9 percent."}
