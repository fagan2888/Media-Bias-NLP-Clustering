Not to be left out, healthinsurance.org\u2019s blog contributors have this year put together their own wish list, but with a special twist:\n\nIn a series of video \u201cletters,\u201d our blog contributors explain to Louise Norris the one gift they\u2019d ask Santa \u2013 or in Charles Gaba\u2019s case, Hanukkah Harry \u2013 to deliver that would build on recent health reform gains and extend Americans\u2019 access to comprehensive, affordable coverage.\n\nIn this segment: Charles Gaba, a healthinsurance.org contributor and founder of ACAsignups.net \u2013 the only place where consumers can consistently follow updates on ACA enrollment. See previous letters from Andrew Sprung, Joanne Boyer, Harold Pollack, Wendell Potter and Linda Bergthold.\n\nTranscript:\n\nLouise Norris: Hi there. My name is Louise Norris and I write about healthcare reform for healthinsurance.org and since it\u2019s the holiday season, my fellow writers and I have teamed up to write a letter to Santa \u2013 or in this case a letter to Hannukah Harry \u2013 asking for some improvements and some changes to healthcare reform and to the Affordable Care Act to make health insurance and healthcare more accessible to more Americans.\n\nAnd so today, I am with Charles Gaba, who is a web designer by trade but he\u2019s also the founder of ACAsignups.net, which has been a go-to resource for me over the last year and has generated a ton of media interest. He\u2019s been cited in the Washington Post, Forbes, New York Times \u2026 widely regarded as the most accurate source for up-to-date ACA enrollment data.\n\nSo with that, welcome Charles, and what would you like from Hanukkah Harry this year?\n\nCharles Gaba: Well, thank you. Well, yes, as you noted, I\u2019m sort of the numbers guy for the beancounter group here and my big focus is on the actual enrollment numbers across the various state exchanges as well as HealthCare.gov.\n\nSo what I\u2019d like from Hannukah Harry this year \u2026 or going forward \u2026 would be I know that recently HealthCare.gov has finally started issuing weekly snapshot reports that have given sort of a total number of plan selections and so on. I\u2019d like to see those weekly snapshots \u2013 while that\u2019s a very good start \u2013 I\u2019d like to see those broken out by state if possible on a weekly basis.\n\nAnd in particular \u2013 and this applies all of the state exchanges and HealthCare.gov \u2013 I\u2019d like some consistency in the actual reporting methodology.\n\nFor example, some of the state exchanges are reporting new enrollees and renewals as a single number, some of them aren\u2019t breaking them out, some are only including one or the other. Some are including Medicaid and CHIP enrollment figures, some aren\u2019t. Some are mixing those together with the private policies.\n\nSome of them don\u2019t report Medicaid at all.\n\nSome of them have been releasing reports daily like Massachusetts. Some have been doing it weekly like Minnesota. Some have been doing them monthly like Colorado and some other states. Some do them pretty much whenever they feel like it, which could be every couple of days or every couple of months or not at all. So I\u2019d like some consistency on that, if possible.\n\nI think daily might be pushing it, but weekly seems pretty reasonable to me. Ideally, I\u2019d like them \u2026 all of the exchanges \u2026 to release their data on the same day each week so that there\u2019s consistency in terms of what you\u2019re comparing the numbers against. For example, this last weekend \u2013 which was the big December surge \u2013 there\u2019s a big difference between a number that comes out on Friday and one that comes out on Sunday or Monday.\n\nAnd finally, I\u2019d also love it \u2013 and this is a general purpose thing for the entire Health and Human Services department and all of the state health departments \u2013 I\u2019d love it if you could standardize your terminology in particular when it comes to Medicaid. I did not know until about a year ago when I started this that Medicaid has a different name in every state. A lot of people don\u2019t know, like I didn\u2019t, that MassHealth in Massachusetts IS Medicaid \u2026 or MediCal IS Medicaid \u2026 or whatever \u2026 Green Mountain Health \u2026 or whatever they call it in different states.\n\nA lot of people don\u2019t know that when politicians are talking about that, they\u2019re talking about Medicaid \u2026 and they think that they\u2019re talking about some other program. So I think that\u2019s important. It would be nice if they all called it Medicaid \u2013 which they probably won\u2019t \u2013 or at the very least if they included a parenthetical reference \u201cMedicaid\u201d any time they\u2019re talking about the program under the state\u2019s name \u2026 and I think that\u2019s about it.\n\nLouise: I think that all sounds excellent: more standardization, more transparency would be perfect. If Hanukkah Harry is feeling especially generous, it would also be great if we had some standardization, reporting from carriers in terms of off-exchange enrollments.\n\nCharles: Mmm, yes, yes, thank you.\n\nLouise: That would great for just for getting a concise picture of how the uninsured rate is falling, and you know it would be \u2026\n\nCharles: Oh, I almost forgot \u2026 don\u2019t forget the SHOP enrollments. I know they\u2019re small right now. SHOP enrollments [unintelligible] as well.\n\nLouise: Excellent requests, Charles, and hopefully Hanukkah Harry will come through for us.\n\nCharles: [laughing] Great.\n\nLouise: Thank you. Great talking with you.\n\nCharles: Likewise.
