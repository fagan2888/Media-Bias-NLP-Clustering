Chief Executive Officer Mark Bertolini said on a call Monday while discussing the company\u2019s fourth-quarter results. \u201cWe remain concerned about the overall stability of the risk pool.\u201d\n\nLarge U.S. health insurers have faced a rocky start in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which in 2014 opened up new markets where millions of Americans buy coverage, often with tax subsidies to help them afford it. Aetna is one of the biggest insurers in Obamacare and, like its rivals UnitedHealth Group Inc. and Anthem Inc., has struggled to make a profit in the business.\n\nAetna\u2019s 1 million individual commercial members make up 4.3 percent of its total membership, as of Dec. 31. Of those, 750,000 are people who signed up through the exchanges. The insurer expects total membership to remain roughly flat this year. Pretax operating losses from the individual business were about 3 percent to 4 percent last year, though should improve this year, Aetna Chief Financial Officer Shawn Guertin said Monday.\n\nTaking Losses\n\nUnitedHealth has said that it will probably take about $1 billion in losses on Obamacare plans when 2015 and 2016 results are combined. The company has that it should have stayed out of the market longer, and that it may quit the program in 2017.\n\nIn the past, Aetna had been more upbeat. Bertolini said in October that it was \u201cway too early to call it quits on the ACA and on the exchanges,\u201d and that the health law offered a \u201cbig opportunity.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe believe we have an obligation to stick it out and work with it until we know that it won\u2019t work,\u201d Bertolini said last month. \u201cIt is too early to give up on this process.\u201d\n\nChanges Needed\n\nGuertin echoed those comments Monday. \u201cI would not say that we\u2019re more pessimistic,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cI would say we\u2019re very much in the same place, which is that it\u2019s premature to declare victory or defeat here.\u201d\n\nGuertin said Bertolini\u2019s remarks were intended to underscore that, even though Aetna\u2019s ACA business appears to be improving, the company still thinks there changes are needed in the ACA\u2019s markets.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want that to get lost in this discussion,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do need things in the long haul to be done to make this a stable risk pool and one that can provide affordable coverage to people over time.\u201d\n\nEarlier Monday, the company reported earnings. Fourth-quarter net income rose 38 percent to $321 million, or 91 cents a share, from $232 million, or 65 cents a share, a year before, the company said in a statement on Monday. Operating earnings were $1.37 a share, compared with the $1.21 average of analysts\u2019 estimates.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Zachary Tracer", "news_keywords": "Health,Anthem Inc,Politics,Aetna Inc,healthcare,Obamacare,health insurance", "parsely-section": "personal-finance", "og": {"url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-02-01/aetna-ceo-has-serious-concerns-about-obamacare-sustainability", "type": "website", "site_name": "Bloomberg.com", "title": "Aetna CEO Has `Serious Concerns' About Obamacare Sustainability"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-02-01/aetna-ceo-has-serious-concerns-about-obamacare-sustainability", "site": "@business", "card": "summary", "title": "Aetna CEO Has `Serious Concerns' About Obamacare Sustainability"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff0000", "parsely-tags": "Health,Anthem Inc,Politics,Aetna Inc,healthcare,Obamacare,health insurance,Region: Global,Page: article", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "parsely-title": "Aetna CEO Has `Serious Concerns' About Obamacare Sustainability", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "parsely-post-id": "O1VGY86S973E01", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.bwbx.io/business/public/images/favicons/mstile-144x144-bbd2101292.png", "parsely-author": "Zachary Tracer", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "Health,Anthem Inc,Politics,Aetna Inc,healthcare,Obamacare,health insurance", "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-pub-date": "2016-02-01T16:19:13.964Z", "date": "2016-02-01T16:19:13.964Z", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-02-01/aetna-ceo-has-serious-concerns-about-obamacare-sustainability"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWe continue to have serious concerns about the sustainability of the public exchanges,\u201d Aetna Inc.
