Orrin Hatch (R., Utah) highlighted a recent GAO report on the lack of oversight within Medicaid\u2019s managed care organizations (MCOs) delivery system, which accounts for roughly $4 billion in waste each year.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s report is particularly troubling given Obamacare expands this broken program without substantial reforms to protect patients and taxpayers,\u201d Hatch said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cCMS is responsible for safeguarding the billions of dollars it receives from hard-working American taxpayers, and I strongly urge [CMS] Administrator [Marilyn] Tavenner to implement the changes recommended by GAO to improve CMS oversight of MCO payments.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis report underscores the need for Medicaid reform in order to ensure that scarce tax dollars are used properly,\u201d he said.\n\nManaged care organizations, in which Medicaid beneficiaries get the majority of their care through an organization under contract with their state, are especially vulnerable to fraud since neither federal nor state governments are \u201cwell positioned to identify improper payments,\u201d the GAO said.\n\n\u201cThe size and diversity of the Medicaid program make it particularly vulnerable to improper payments\u2014including payments made for treatments or services that were not covered by program rules, that were not medically necessary, or that were billed for but never provided,\u201d the report said.\n\nNearly 50 million people currently receive benefits through MCOs. While MCO payments are still overshadowed by fee-for-service payments (FFS)\u2014the traditional method where health care providers are paid for each service\u2014individuals receiving their care through MCOs are \u201cgrowing at a faster rate.\u201d\n\nState officials told the GAO that they have \u201cnot begun to closely examine program integrity in Medicaid managed care.\u201d While the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services (CMS) requires states to audit their payments according to their MCO contracts, states are not required to audit the \u201cappropriateness of these payments.\u201d\n\nThe GAO warned that the problem would worsen under Obamacare, which has expanded Medicaid programs in many states.\n\n\u201cImproving federal and state efforts to strengthen Medicaid managed care program integrity takes on greater urgency as states that choose to expand their Medicaid programs under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act are likely to do so with managed care arrangements, and will receive a 100 percent federal match for newly eligible individuals from 2014 through 2016,\u201d the report said.\n\n\u201cUnless CMS takes a larger role in holding states accountable, and provides guidance and support to states to ensure adequate program integrity efforts in Medicaid managed care, the gap between state and federal efforts to monitor managed care program integrity will leave a growing portion of federal Medicaid dollars vulnerable to improper payments,\u201d it said.\n\nOverall, Medicaid covered 71.7 million Americans in fiscal year 2013, totaling $431.1 billion, an estimated $14.4 billion of which were improper payments.", "article_metadata": {"description": "GAO: problem will worsen under Obamacare", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "The federal government paid out $14.4 billion in fraudulent reimbursements through Medicaid last year, according to the Government Accountability Office (GAO).
