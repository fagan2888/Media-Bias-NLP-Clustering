With both Harris and Webster down for the Broncos\u2019 preseason game here Sunday for the christening of Levi\u2019s Stadium, the expectation is either first-round draft pick Bradley Roby or veteran Tony Carter will start.\n\nRoby comes in to play right cornerback, while Webster shifts inside to nickel when the Broncos employ their sub packages.\n\nWebster had a terrific training camp. A third-round pick in the 2013 draft, Webster had been using his full season of NFL experience to stay ahead of the rookie Roby on the depth chart.\n\nWebster\u2019s ankle injury is not considered serious, although he may miss the bulk of the Broncos\u2019 three practices next week against the Houston Texans.\n\nNevada reunion. San Francisco quarterback Colin Kaepernick and Broncos\u2019 new starting weakside linebacker Brandon Marshall were college teammates at Nevada.\n\nMarshall will be calling the Broncos\u2019 defensive signals Sunday while Kaepernick will be trying to read him from the other side of scrimmage.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited,\u201d Marshall said. \u201cIf I can get a sack on him that would be great. He\u2019s good, man. He\u2019s probably the hardest working guy in terms of training \u2014 and I mean that \u2014 of anyone I\u2019ve been around. Every athlete I\u2019ve trained with, he works probably the hardest.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Broncos cornerback Kayvon Webster to miss 49ers game with injury", "title": "Broncos cornerback Kayvon Webster to miss 49ers game with injury", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/16/broncos-cornerback-kayvon-webster-to-miss-49ers-game-with-injury/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140816__Kayvon-Websterp1-1.jpg", "height": 476}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140816__Kayvon-Websterp1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-16T22:18:11+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T10:10:48+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Roby comes in to play right cornerback, while Webster shifts inside to nickel when the Broncos employ their sub packages.\nWebster had been starting at right cornerback while Chris Harris continues to recover from offseason knee surgery.\nSANTA CLARA, Calif. \u2014 Kayvon Webster didn\u2019t join the Broncos on their trip for Sunday\u2019s preseason game against the San Francisco 49ers after he sprained his ankle during practice Saturday morning.\nWith both Harris and Webster down for the Broncos\u2019 preseason game here Sunday for the christening of Levi\u2019s Stadium, the expectation is either first-round draft pick Bradley Roby or veteran Tony Carter will start.\nSan Francisco quarterback Colin Kaepernick and Broncos\u2019 new starting weakside linebacker Brandon Marshall were college teammates at Nevada."}
