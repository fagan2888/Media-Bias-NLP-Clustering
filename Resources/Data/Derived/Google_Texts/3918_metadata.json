She\u2019s headlining a press conference at the Mission Valley location of McDonalds corporate offices today to talk about a University of California Berkeley study detailing the cost to California taxpayers for fast food companies\u2019 low wages and lack of benefits.\n\nFast food is a $200 billion a year industry, with many workers earning minimum wage or just above it forced to rely on public assistance programs to provide for their families and afford healthcare for their children. Nationally, the median wage for cooks, cashiers and crew at fast-food restaurants is just $8.94 an hour.\n\nContrary to the claims of companies like McDonalds, Burger King and Wendy\u2019s, fast food jobs are not a stepping-stone to better opportunities or held mostly by young people. The National Employment Law Project reports that managerial positions make up just 2.2% of fast food jobs. The median age in the industry is 28, according to the group, and more than a quarter of workers are raising at least one child.\n\nThe meat of the matter, from Josh Eidelson via Salon.com:\n\nTwin studies released at noon Tuesday estimate that the majority of families of front-line fast food workers use public assistance, at a taxpayer cost of nearly $7 billion a year, while seven publicly-traded fast food corporations made $7.4 billion in profit last year.\n\nThe first study finds that 52 percent of families of workers employed at least twenty-seven weeks a year and ten hours a week in rank-and-file fast food jobs are enrolled in Medicaid, the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, food stamps, the Federal Earned Income Tax Credit, or Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (the program which replaced Aid to Families with Dependent Children under \u201cwelfare reform\u201d). That includes a majority of those workers who are employed at least forty hours week. The study, Fast Food, Poverty Wages, was sponsored by the UC Berkeley Center for Labor Research and Education and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Department of Urban & Regional Planning, and funded by the labor group Fast Food Forward. The estimates were based on government data.\n\nA second study, by the pro-union National Employment Law Project, extended the analysis to individual companies, estimating that McDonald\u2019s workers received $1.2 billion in public assistance while the corporation netted $5.5 billion in Fiscal Year 2012 profits, and devoted $5.5 billion to dividends and stock buybacks.\n\nIn August, fast-food workers in 60 cities across the country went on strike, calling for higher wages, so they do not have to rely on public assistance programs to get by.\n\nReuters quotes NELP analyst and researcher Jack Temple\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter whether you work or shop at McDonald\u2019s or not, the low-wage business model is expensive for everybody. Companies \u2026 are basically pushing off part of their costs on the taxpayers.\u201d\n\nThe State of the State of California: Gov. Brown Walks Fine Line on Legislation\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter who you talk to; Gov. Jerry Brown has blood on his hands following this year\u2019s executive review of 896 laws that made it to his desk.\n\nGun control advocates are angry about his veto of a significant bill banning the manufacture, import and sale of semiautomatic rifles with detachable magazines and requiring those who already own such guns to register them.\n\nSocial conservatives are irate because Gov. Brown signed Assemblywoman Toni Atkins\u2019 bill expanding access to abortions by allowing non-physician health practitioners to perform first trimester aspiration procedures. California was the only state in the country to expand access to abortions in 2013.\n\nThe Governor vetoed 11% (96) of the laws presented for his signature.\n\nSeveral political tea leaf readers interpreted his yeas and nays as a clear indication that Brown carefully considered the implications of his actions with 2014 campaigns (including his own) in mind.\n\nFrom the Los Angeles Times:\n\n\u2026 the famously moderate governor was also a check on their most liberal tendencies, vetoing some ideas as too extreme and issuing warnings that blocked proposed tax hikes before they even reached his desk.\n\n\u201cHe has struck me as the adult in the room,\u201d said Larry Gerston, a political scientist at San Jose State. He kept the Democrats \u201cfrom going to a point where some people would think they are abusing their two-thirds majority.\u201d\n\nWith his centrist actions, Brown could help Democrats retain their supermajority in next year\u2019s elections, especially those lawmakers who represent swing districts. And the governor\u2019s middle-of-the-road inclinations were on display in many areas.\n\nLegislation approved by Gov. Brown included:\n\nEleven bills boosting rights and benefits for immigrants.\n\nSB 569, requiring that interrogations of underage suspects in homicide cases be videotaped.\n\nA 25% raise in the minimum wage by 2016\n\nOvertime pay for domestic workers\n\nA ban on the use of lead ammunition, along with the requirement that long gun purchasers take a firearm safety class and criminal liability for firearm storage that endangers a child\n\nRequiring the state\u2019s 50 charter cities to pay prevailing wages for state funded public works projects\n\nPlacing a measure on the June ballot allowing the state to restructure $600 million in bonds to help build apartments and houses for low-income veterans\n\nA bill allowing two tier tuitions for some Community Colleges for hard-to-obtain classes such as college algebra, history and English needed by students to graduate and transfer.\n\nVetoes from the Governor\u2019s office included:\n\nA proposal allowing prosecutors to charge possession of heroin and cocaine as misdemeanors rather than felonies.\n\nLegislation giving Medi-Cal interpreters the right to join a public employee union and bargain collectively with the state along with establishing a certification process and registry of medical interpreters\n\nAssembly Bill 1229, by Assemblyman Toni Atkins, allowing cities and counties to establish inclusionary housing requirements as a condition of development, forcing developers to set aside units for low-income residents.\n\nA measure requiring anyone seeking to qualify an initiative for the statewide ballot to use non-paid volunteers to collect at least 10 percent of signatures.\n\nLegislation extending the statute of limitations for sex abuse victims who were excluded from a 2003 law that extended the statute of limitations.\n\nA rather complicated package of rules aiming to streamline the process of firing teachers in California. (It also removed an outdated statute listing \u201cknowing membership in the Communist Party\u201d as grounds for termination.)\n\nNo Budget Deal Today in DC\n\nYou may heard mutterings this morning about a \u201cdeal\u201d to end the current budgetary standoff coming from the Senate. I wouldn\u2019t place too much stock in it, as House Republicans are already plotting to derail the proposed agreement, including a Boehner approved \u201cbi-partisan\u201d measure.\n\nThe scheming took place at an off the record meeting led by Texas Tea Party Sen. Ted Cruz at DC\u2019s Tortilla Coast restaurant last night. From Roll Call:\n\nThe group appeared to be talking strategy about how they should respond to a tentative Senate deal to reopen the government and raise the debt ceiling without addressing Obamacare in a substantive way, according to sources who witnessed the gathering. The Texas Republican senator and many of the House Republicans in attendance had insisted on including amendments aimed at dismantling Obamacare in the continuing resolution that was intended to avert the current shutdown.\n\nSources said the House Republicans meeting in the basement of Tortilla Coast with Cruz were some of the most conservative in the House: Reps. Louie Gohmert of Texas, Steve King of Iowa, Jim Jordan of Ohio, Tom Cotton of Arkansas, Ra\u00fal R. Labrador of Idaho, Steve Southerland II of Florida, Mark Meadows of North Carolina and Justin Amash of Michigan.\n\nThe group is a collection of members who have often given leadership headaches in recent years by opposing both compromise measures as well as packages crafted by fellow Republicans. And, it seems, leadership unwittingly became aware of the meetup.\n\nA familiar face took the lead in announcing the \u201cbipartisan\u201d House bill. From the New York Times:\n\nRep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) said the new House plan was designed to be attractive to Democrats, because it would follow key timelines that have been established in the Senate negotiations \u2014 funding government agencies until Jan. 15, for example, and raising the debt ceiling until Feb. 7.\n\nBut the plan would also include a two-year repeal of the medical device tax, and a provision eliminating the employer health-care contribution for members of Congress and White House officials, changes that are likely to generate strenuous opposition.\n\n\u201cWe think we\u2019ve enhanced it in a number of ways,\u201d Issa said of the Senate framework. Asked how the House would react if the Senate rejected the changes, he said, \u201cWe haven\u2019t passed our bill. They haven\u2019t passed their bill . . . We today will pass a bill we believe the Senate should accept based on their likely negotiations.\u201d\n\nApparently the House leadership\u2019s definition of \u201cbi-partisan\u201d has been expanded to include the mere possibility of Democratic approval. Word is that Speaker Boehner doesn\u2019t know if he has enough GOP votes to move this measure. \u2026Oh, and some House Teahadists are also demanding that restrictions on contraception coverage also be part of any package.\n\nLate Breaking Filner Flash:\n\nFrom NBC/News 7:\n\nFormer San Diego mayor Bob Filner, forced to resign in August amidst allegations of sexual harassment by a former employee, now faces a felony criminal charge for false imprisonment and two misdemeanor counts of battery, court officials confirmed Tuesday.\n\nUPDATE: Via a plea agreement, the former Mayor pled guilty to 1 felony and 2 misdemeanor charges. Although not confirmed, sources report the deal means no jail time. Filner will be formally booked on October 20th, released with out bail and sentenced on December 9th.\n\nPRESS RELEASE- Here\u2019s a copy of the press release from the CA Atty General with terms of the sentencing:\n\nAttorney General Kamala D. Harris today announced that former San Diego Mayor Bob Filner has plead guilty to one count of felony false imprisonment and two counts of misdemeanor battery.\n\nFilner entered his guilty plea today in San Diego County Superior Court.\n\n\u201cThis conduct was not only criminal, it was also an extreme abuse of power,\u201d said Attorney General Harris. \u201cThis prosecution is about consequence and accountability. No one is above the law.\u201d\n\nUnder the terms of the plea agreement, Filner must surrender his Mayoral pension from the date the felony was committed (March 6, 2013) until the date he resigned office (August 23, 2013). He will serve probation for three years and home confinement for three months. The agreement also prohibits Filner from ever seeking or holding public office again. As a consequence of the felony plea, Filner may not vote, serve on a jury or own a firearm while he is on probation.\n\nFilner is required to undergo treatment as directed by a mental health professional throughout his probation. If he violates the terms of his probation, he may face up to 6 months in jail.\n\nFines including restitution, probation and court fees will be determined at Filner\u2019s sentencing hearing, which will be announced today.\n\nThe California Attorney General\u2019s office was assisted in this investigation by the San Diego County Sheriff\u2019s Department.\n\nHappy ObamaHalloScare\n\nFox News\u2019\u201dThe Real Story\u201d host Gretchen Carlson is peddling fear mongering to intimidate Americans from learning more about how the Affordable Care Act (aka ObamaCare) can benefit them. Fox News is so terrified that people will discover how much there is to gain by enrolling, that they continue to invent ever more frightening tales of horror.\n\nOn This Day: 1860 \u2013 Grace Bedell, 11 years old, wrote a letter to presidential candidate Abraham Lincoln.
