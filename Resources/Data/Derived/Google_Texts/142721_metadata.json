Associated Press\n\nLAREDO - Patti Magnon grew up on the other side of the Rio Grande -- in the adjacent Mexican city known as Nuevo Laredo.\n\nBut the border here has never been a barrier, and Magnon, who has lived on the U.S. side now for years, feels at home in both. \u201cProud to be an American & a Catholic!\u201d proclaims her bio on Twitter. \u201cLove my Mexican heritage! An immigrant is not the same as an illegal immigrant.\u201d\n\nThese days, Magnon sometimes feels she has more in common with Americans elsewhere across the country than with Latino families here in Texas, and that started when she told people she was voting for Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cThey bash you,\u201d said Gina Gil, who\u2019s also joined a small but enthusiastic group of people here on the border who like what Trump has to say -- especially about immigration, a subject that, here on the banks of the Rio Grande, they feel they know as much about as anybody.\n\n\u201cI find it insulting when people say people who follow Trump are uneducated, unintelligent,\u201d said Magnon.\n\n\u201cTe aventaste!\u201d Gil exclaimed. \u201cYou hit it.\u201d\n\nAcross the country, only a small minority of Latinos have backed Trump, and even here in Texas, a plurality of Latino Republicans voted for home-grown U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, who won the March 1 primary with 44 percent of the overall vote to Trump\u2019s 27 percent. (Cruz has since dropped out.) Now as ever, most Latinos vote Democratic, and in Texas, where Latinos make up more than a quarter of the electorate, up to 71 percent of them backed Hillary Clinton, according to exit polls.\n\nIt was here on the border that Trump scored his biggest Texas victories, capturing Laredo\u2019s Webb County, which is 95 percent Latino, and Zapata County next door (94 percent), as well as Terrell County (49 percent Latino) and Hudspeth County (78 percent), which are farther west.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the hardworking people,\u201d said Miriam Cepeda, 24, a history major at the nearby University of Texas-Pan American who is leading Trump\u2019s campaign in the Rio Grande Valley east of Laredo. What she hears, she says, is a lot of resentment aimed at undocumented immigrants who receive government services. \u201cThose that pay the taxes and do what they\u2019re supposed to say, \u2018Why do I have to pay?\u2019\u201d\n\nMagnon and Gil voted for Trump in the Texas primary, plan to vote for him in the general election, and are waging their own kind of ad hoc citizens\u2019 campaign, praising him on radio shows and online, recruiting friends and family.\n\nThe two women met last summer when Trump came here, to the Southwest border\u2019s third-most populous city, behind El Paso and San Diego.\n\nMagnon drove her 7-year-old daughter, Allie, to the small local airport to see the real estate magnate. They were greeted in this majority Democratic, heavily Mexican-American town by a crowd of opponents chanting into megaphones: \u201cDump Trump!\u201d\n\nBoth Magnon, 44, and Gil, 49, are former Democrats -- working mothers with community college educations who say they\u2019re alarmed about welfare fraud, illegal immigration and the rising costs of health care. Magnon almost lost her health insurance when Obamacare took effect. Gil seethed at paying an $800 penalty under the new federal health care law, but insurance would have cost even more.\n\nTrump promised to run the country like a business and repeal Obamacare. They didn\u2019t think he was racist when he promised to build a bigger border wall to keep out Mexican \u201crapists.\u201d They thought he was right -- and were delighted to find that others around town agreed with them.\n\n\u201cI was surprised other people in Laredo think like I do,\u201d Magnon said.\n\nGil\u2019s father was an electrician, her mother a day care worker. Raised on the south side of town near the river, she was a cheerleader in high school but was pregnant with the first of five children at age 16. She helped her husband start a bakery. But the union was not a happy one, and Gil eventually left, working multiple jobs, training as a paralegal, buying rental properties and businesses.\n\nThe tough-talking single mother relied on undocumented Mexican migrants to watch her children and run her businesses _ but at least none of them were on welfare, she says. \u201cI could never have done it on my own,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not Wonder Woman. You have to keep your boat afloat.\u201d\n\nShe says she spent many years working so hard that the only time she saw her children was when she drove by her house and waved at them through the front window.\n\nGil still lives near the Rio Grande. Tooling around in her custom 2015 white Audi recently, she pointed to homes and businesses she had bought, all for cash. When she stopped to pick up her blood pressure medication, $71.75 for a month\u2019s supply, she pointed to the button for the state welfare benefit, \u201cLone Star,\u201d for those who are receiving state assistance.\n\n\u201cDo I press \u2018Lone Star\u2019? Ha!\u201d she said, then paid out of her own pocket.\n\nGil called a local bilingual radio show recently to praise Trump\u2019s promises to crack down on welfare cheats.\n\n\u201cTrump is right. Just because he\u2019s a billionaire _ well, he worked hard for what he has,\u201d she said.\n\nUnless someone stops the flow of illegal immigration and stabilizes the economy, Gil worries, \u201cOur kids are going to be working like psychos for the deadbeats.\u201d\n\nMagnon worries about many of the same things. She and her siblings spent their childhood in Laredo\u2019s Mexican sister city, Nuevo Laredo. Her father worked for an import-export business, her mother for a chain of retail stores. The family had an extensive staff including a driver and housekeeping staff.\n\nWhen Magnon was in high school they moved to Laredo, where she married 22 years ago and settled with her husband, an oil company manager, in a northern subdivision near the country club.\n\n\u201cPeople say, \u2018Why do you say you\u2019re Mexican?\u2019 Because my people are Mexican and American. People think we\u2019re second-rate citizens and we\u2019re not,\u201d she said. \u201cWe come to the U.S. and have so much to offer other than we\u2019re just illegals.\u201d\n\nMagnon remembers visiting her grandmother\u2019s house by the river, where migrants would arrive wet and hungry. Her grandmother provided water, taquitos and coins to the temporary workers, who inevitably returned to their families in Mexico. Now, Magnon said, migrants who cross illegally seem to stay and apply for welfare, such as the federally funded Women, Infants and Children program (WIC), which provides food, health care referrals and nutrition education to low-income mothers with young children.\n\n\u201cLiving in a border town, I\u2019ve seen how it\u2019s changed, where the maids we have here, illegally, they\u2019re not leaving. They\u2019re having kids here, they get Medicaid, food stamps, WIC. It is just unbelievable what they get,\u201d she said.\n\nMagnon is deeply religious, and feels conflicted at times about how to best help immigrants.\n\nWhen Laredo and other border cities saw an influx of Central American migrant families and children two years ago, Magnon drove to the local Greyhound station with donations. \u201cThey\u2019re coming over here because (of) what they\u2019re promised,\u201d Magnon said. \u201cBut at the same time, who is going to pay for all the entitlement programs?\u201d\n\nShe hasn\u2019t crossed the border with her family in a decade due to the escalating violence in Mexico, and her youngest daughter has never crossed. A friend\u2019s husband did, and was kidnapped and held for ransom.\n\n\u201cThat makes me so sad -- because I have walked those streets,\u201d Magnon said, eyes tearing as she thought of her three girls. \u201cI want them to know where I was raised and their heritage.\u201d\n\nWhen she hears Trump talk about building a wall to keep out those not legally entitled to enter the country, she isn\u2019t offended. She\u2019s reassured: \u201cHe said the Mexicans who are crossing are rapists and murderers. Well, he\u2019s right. He\u2019s not talking about us. He\u2019s talking about the illegals.\u201d\n\nBoth women see the New York businessman as the only one who can make a change.\n\nMagnon voted for Hillary Clinton in 2008, but now considers her corrupt. She had high hopes for President Barack Obama before she saw how he handled immigration and national security.\n\n\u201cHe always lets me down. Sometimes I think, \u2018Are you proud to be an American?\u2019\u201d\n\nTrump, she said, \u201cmade me feel safe. He\u2019s that fighter. He\u2019s so proud to be an American.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith the balls!\u201d Gil interjected, and the two women chuckled.\n\nDuring breakfast not long ago at Eduardo\u2019s, a Mexican steakhouse full of saddles and mounted deer heads, Gil stopped the Latina waitress to ask whom she was voting for, and what she thinks of Trump.\n\n\u201cWhat Trump is saying is true,\u201d Teresa Castro replied.\n\nThe server said she works four days a week for $45, no benefits, and has struggled to care for her epileptic husband. She applied for Medicaid but was ineligible.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all in the same boat,\u201d Gil told her.\n\nGil and Magnon say they fear for their children\u2019s future. Gil worries her kids will have to work as hard as she did.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to live the same life I lived,\u201d she said ruefully.\n\nThe women picked up and prepared to join their families _ Gil\u2019s at a barbecue, Magnon\u2019s at church.\n\n\u201cWell, hopefully not,\u201d Magnon said. \u201cIf Trump is elected.\u201d\n\n---\n\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "MRT.com", "description": "LAREDO - Patti Magnon grew up on the other side of the Rio Grande -- in the adjacent Mexican city known as Nuevo Laredo.", "title": "How Donald Trump scored a win in Texas border country", "url": "http://www.mrt.com/news/politics/article_5dfd87c4-194d-11e6-abd7-0f40a0754f6a.html", "image": {"width": 892, "identifier": "http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/mrt.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/d/b9/db99e43e-147f-11e6-af80-0b5aca846cac/572e3136a0c24.image.jpg?resize=892%2C630", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary"}, "description": "LAREDO - Patti Magnon grew up on the other side of the Rio Grande -- in the adjacent Mexican city known as Nuevo Laredo.", "alexaVerifyID": "A6ceEFS0S5jDksnNeroDWYv-Ng8", "msvalidate.01": "413490AB8B4C8646430571E6A42CDACD", "fb": {"admins": 683724462, "page_id": 361381078011, "app_id": 361381078011}, "google-site-verification": "xNnVfsZTVBWcZfJ0g8VA3xLs604yxyfE-XDF2qcsuS8", "keywords": "Midland,news, A6ceEFS0S5jDksnNeroDWYv-Ng8", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheReporterTelegram"}, "y_key": "b7ecaaeb522529c1", "news_keywords": "politics,state_and_national,top_stories"}, "article_summary": "Gil and Magnon say they fear for their children\u2019s future.\n\u201cI find it insulting when people say people who follow Trump are uneducated, unintelligent,\u201d said Magnon.\n\u201cLiving in a border town, I\u2019ve seen how it\u2019s changed, where the maids we have here, illegally, they\u2019re not leaving.\nRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks during a rally in Eugene, Ore., on Friday.\n\u201cPeople say, \u2018Why do you say you\u2019re Mexican?\u2019 Because my people are Mexican and American."}
