For American conservatives, it’s a picture worth a thousand reasons not to trust John Boehner.

Or, as author Ben Shapiro put it, “Ladies and gentlemen, your Republican Party.”

The Republican speaker of the House was photographed kissing House minority leader Nancy Pelosi during a Rose Garden ceremony to celebrate passage of a bill to restructure how Medicare pays doctors for treating patients.



It’s an important bill, and it’s been a long time coming, but no bill makes a picture like that worthwhile.



The San Francisco Democrat who brought us Obamacare makes conservatives’ crawl.



Apparently, not Boehner’s though.

@thehill if i didn’t know they were on the same side, i’d think it was some mafia thing or something. — Linda Jansen (@SIRATYST) April 22, 2015

@thehill Reminds me of another kiss witnessed by 500 Romans. But how many of the Romans could tell who was who & what was what? #Idontknowit — Shadab A. Siddiqi (@KnoxvilleShadab) April 22, 2015

@thehill that’s a cute pic, but Boehner really should be kissing her ass since he can’t seem to pass legislation without her support. — skeptical brotha (@skepticalbrotha) April 22, 2015
