In his 20 years working at the van, Ammerman has treated thousands of uninsured teens and young adults. ( Farida Jhabvala Romero/KQED )\n\nDr. Seth Ammerman listens intently to his new patient. Ernesto, who does not want his last name disclosed, is homeless. Ernesto is earning a high school degree and working part time, but at night, he and his brother share a tent that they set up on San Jose streets. The daily stress of being homeless is wearing Ernesto out and making him light up too many cigarettes.\n\n\u2018These kids, because of all these access barriers \u2014 lack of insurance, lack of transportation \u2014 they\u2019re not going to get this kind of care unless we go to them.\u2019 Dr. Seth Ammerman, medical director, Stanford Teen Health Van\n\n\u201cI just want to cut down on my smoking,\u201d says Ernesto, 21, with a tentative, soft voice. \u201cI\u2019ve been on the streets all the time, you know? I just want to make sure I\u2019m OK.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s why Ernesto walked into this mobile clinic parked just a few steps away from his classroom at the San Jose Conservation Corps & Charter School. He\u2019s sitting in a fully equipped exam room inside a shiny blue tour bus with Wi-Fi and the ability to get HIV test results in 20 minutes.\n\nDuring the consultation with Ernesto, Ammerman nods sympathetically. In his 20 years working in this teen health van, Ammerman has treated thousands of uninsured and homeless adolescents ages 24 and under.\n\nTwice a week, Ammerman and two nurses park the clinic at continuation high schools and other places frequented by at-risk adolescents in Santa Clara, San Mateo and San Francisco counties. The van is a community project of the Lucile Packard Children\u2019s Hospital Stanford and Children\u2019s Health Fund, with support from Samsung.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe team provides free medical, nutrition and mental health services, including reproductive health care and treatment for chronic illnesses, substance abuse and depression. All medications are free and provided at the time of consultation. A social worker is available for counseling and connects adolescents to additional resources; a registered dietitian works with patients who are malnourished, a frequent health issue for this population.\n\nSome of the 400 patients who visit the teen health van each year have never seen a doctor, says Ammerman.\n\n\u201cGoing to the patients makes all the difference, and it\u2019s not just a matter of convenience,\u201d says Ammerman, a clinical professor of adolescent medicine at Stanford University. \u201cIt really is that these kids, because of all these access barriers \u2014 lack of insurance, lack of transportation \u2014 they\u2019re not going to get this kind of care unless we go to them.\u201d\n\nFor many patients here, the teen health van can become a trustworthy and reliable place in an otherwise unstable world.\n\nGrace Kim first set foot in the van 10 years ago when she was 17. She admits she was skeptical.\n\n\u201cBecause it was a van, and I wasn\u2019t really sure what they could really provide for me,\u201d says Kim, 27. \u201cOff the bat I don\u2019t trust people very easily and that probably comes from the territory that I grew up in.\u201d\n\nKim, a second-generation Korean-American, says she grew up with abusive relatives in a house \u201cfull of conflict.\u201d By the time she was 14, she had already attempted suicide. With the help of a high school counselor, Kim moved out of her parents\u2019 home into a transitional living program, which required her to get medical checkups at the van initially. For the next four years, Kim was a regular patient.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmmerman and other staff at the van treated Kim\u2019s malnutrition, substance abuse and other health issues. They connected her with free visits to see a psychiatrist at Stanford Medical Center who treated her depression, and she thrived.\n\n\u201cIf I didn\u2019t get that help, I would probably be in a very bad place,\u201d says Kim, now a master\u2019s student in counseling psychology at Santa Clara University. \u201cThe whole mental health aspect of it was probably the most beneficial, probably the most powerful.\u201d\n\nToday, Kim facilitates a support group for suicide survivors at Santa Clara Valley Medical Center and says her passion for her work comes from those dark days in her past. She still keeps in touch with Ammerman, calling him once in a while with health-related questions.\n\n\u201cI trust him absolutely with everything because he\u2019s seen me at my worst, and he still to this day has the most faith in me,\u201d says Kim, adding that Ammerman motivated her to take care of herself and do better. \u201cTo have someone care for you and tell you that you can get better and do anything that you put you heart into. \u2026 I mean, there are no words for that.\u201d\n\nKim recognizes she was lucky to have access to housing, medical and mental health resources, but that may not be true for others.\n\nHealth Van Patients Often Face Precarious Housing\n\nOver 40 percent of Stanford\u2019s teen health van patients are homeless, says Ammerman. These are adolescents up to age 25 living on the streets, in cars and, most commonly, overcrowded apartments. While doubling up with relatives or friends may sound like housing, it\u2019s not stable because people can be asked to leave at any time.\n\nAmmerman says he\u2019s seen a significant increase in this population of teens and young adults \u2014 those living in overcrowded conditions \u2014 since 2008. Working families unable to make rent are more likely to end up in these challenging conditions.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing, unfortunately, more homeless kids. And that\u2019s really due to the housing crisis that we are all aware of here in the Bay Area,\u201d says Ammerman.\n\nHomeless Youth Population Growing in California\n\nMost Bay Area counties and the state as a whole are seeing a greater number of homeless kids in recent years, according to figures collected by the California Department of Education and crunched by Kidsdata.org. The education department designates students as \u201chomeless\u201d if their primary residence at any point in the school year was a:\n\nShelter\n\nHotel or motel\n\nShared housing with others due to loss of housing or economic hardship\n\nNo shelter at all.\n\nStatewide, the rate of homeless public school students in grades K-12 jumped by one-third in just three years \u2014 from 3.6 percent in 2011 to 4.8 percent in 2014. More than 86 percent of the nearly 300,000 homeless public school students statewide are living doubled up with friends or relatives.\n\n\u201cSo it\u2019s a very unstable housing situation, and that is always problematic for your health,\u201d says Ammerman.\n\nChildren and youth facing homelessness or housing insecurity are more likely than their peers to face chronic illness and mental health problems, as well as traumas and safety risks, studies show.\n\nResources for Homeless Youth are Not Keeping Up\n\nShahera Hyatt directs the California Homeless Youth Project at the California Research Bureau in Sacramento. She supports Ammerman\u2019s experience as to why the state is seeing a lot more child, youth and family homelessness.\n\n\u201cWe know that housing affordability is in crisis proportions,\u201d says Hyatt. \u201cIn many communities across the state there\u2019s rapid gentrification happening and a very low housing stock.\u201d\n\nHomeless youth \u2014 particularly those constantly on the streets or without any access to shelters \u2014 risk sexual abuse, police harassment and substance addiction. Yet the state is woefully lacking in services and resources for this population, says Hyatt.\n\nSacramento has a single six-bed transitional housing center for young adults \u2014 and a nine-month waiting list of about 100 people, says Hyatt. She added that two-thirds of the state\u2019s counties lack shelters and other basic services for homeless youth.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of mythology about why young people become homeless \u2026 that they are unruly or want to live outside. But that\u2019s not true,\u201d says Hyatt. \u201cA lot of these people are really disenfranchised by the lack of services out there and become homeless.\u201d\n\nSince 1988, California has spent $1.1 million annually on programs that serve homeless youth: the Homeless Youth and Exploitation Program and the California Youth Crisis Line, according to the California Coalition for Youth.\n\nA bill introduced last month by Assemblywoman Young Kim, AB1699, would provide $25 million in funding for homeless youth emergency service projects. The bill\u2019s first hearing should be in the next two months, according to Bryan Shroyer in Kim\u2019s office.\n\nPopularity of Mobile Clinics Increases\n\nMeanwhile, mobile health clinics like Ammerman\u2019s in San Jose continue to fill a gap in access to care for uninsured youth. That model of delivering care directly to underserved populations has been gaining popularity nationwide.\n\nIn the last two decades, the number of mobile clinics has grown to about 2,000 throughout the country, according to the Mobile Health Clinics Association.\n\n\u201cWhat we are seeing is greater acceptance that mobile care can be really high-quality care,\u201d says Dr. Delaney Gracy, chief medical officer with the Children\u2019s Health Fund. \u201cMore people are realizing that mobile health is an important part of safety net care.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the teen health van\u2019s exam room, Ammerman is ending his consultation with Ernesto by handing him packages of nicotine gum, the medication Ernesto chose from several options to help him quit smoking. Before Ernesto leaves, Ammerman has one last question for first-time patients like him.\n\n\u201cWe literally ask each kid, \u2018What are you good at, what are your strengths?\u2019 And they\u2019re shocked at this question because no one\u2019s ever asked that before,\u201d says Ammerman.\n\nWhen Ernesto\u2019s turn comes to answer, he thinks for a while before responding.\n\n\u201cUm \u2026 I like to work and stay busy,\u201d says Ernesto. \u201cAnd I motivate my brothers a lot, as much as I can.\u201d\n\n\u201cCool! That\u2019s a really cool thing,\u201d responds Ammerman.\n\nAs his patients successfully take steps to care for their health, says Ammerman, they also gain the confidence to tackle other goals, like getting steady housing.\n\n\u201cThese kids have strengths, and by focusing on their strengths it can really make a difference. Because strength builds strength. And success builds success,\u201d says Ammerman.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Statewide, the rate of homeless public school students in grades K-12 jumped by one-third in just three years.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Mobile Clinics Serve California's Growing Homeless Youth Population\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2016\\/02\\/15\\/as-homeless-youth-population-grows-mobile-clinics-are-key-resource\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2016-02-15 06:57:04\",\"mod_date\":\"2016-02-17 14:47:36\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":146345,\"author_id\":\"8659\",\"author_name\":\"Farida Jhabvala Romero\",\"author_display_name\":\"Farida Jhabvala Romero\",\"tags\":[\"Children's Health\",\"Homeless\",\"News\",\"Uninsured\"],\"categories\":[\"Community Health\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2016\\/02\\/RS18409_IMG_4491.JPG-qut.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "Statewide, the rate of homeless public school students in grades K-12 jumped by one-third in just three years.", "title": "Mobile Clinics Serve California\u2019s Growing Homeless Youth Population", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2016/02/15/as-homeless-youth-population-grows-mobile-clinics-are-key-resource/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2016/02/RS18411_IMG_4503.JPG-qut.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@faridajhabvala"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "children\\'s health,homeless,news,uninsured", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Resources for Homeless Youth are Not Keeping UpShahera Hyatt directs the California Homeless Youth Project at the California Research Bureau in Sacramento.\nHealth Van Patients Often Face Precarious HousingOver 40 percent of Stanford\u2019s teen health van patients are homeless, says Ammerman.\nA bill introduced last month by Assemblywoman Young Kim, AB1699, would provide $25 million in funding for homeless youth emergency service projects.\nShe added that two-thirds of the state\u2019s counties lack shelters and other basic services for homeless youth.\n\u201cA lot of these people are really disenfranchised by the lack of services out there and become homeless.\u201dSince 1988, California has spent $1.1 million annually on programs that serve homeless youth: the Homeless Youth and Exploitation Program and the California Youth Crisis Line, according to the California Coalition for Youth."}
