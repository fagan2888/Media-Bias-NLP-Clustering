NASA Predicts 99% Probability Of LA Earthquake Within 30 Months

NASA scientists are forecasting a 99 per cent probability of a 5.0 magnitude earthquake in Los Angeles within the next 30 months.

Experts at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena believe the earthquake could reach as high as magnitude 6.3 on the Richter scale. The findings are contested, however, with seismologists at the US Geological Survey estimating the probability of a moderately-sized earthquake within the next three years closer to 85 per cent.

Regardless, scientists across the US are in agreement that Los Angeles will weather another earthquake in the near future.

A 5.1 magnitude earthquake struck the La Habra area last year, just one hour after the original 3.6 quake hit. More than 30 aftershocks were reported thoughout the night and 2000 people were left without power.
