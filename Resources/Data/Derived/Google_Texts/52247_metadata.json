But doctors say they are now all-but impossible to find because restrictive currency controls have deprived local businesses of the cash to import foreign goods. It may not be the gravest shortfall facing the socialist South American country, but surgeons say the issue cuts to the psyche of the image-conscious Venezuelan woman.\n\n\u201cThe women are complaining,\u201d said Ramon Zapata, president of the Society of Plastic Surgeons. \u201cVenezuelan women are very concerned with their self-esteem.\u201d\n\nVenezuela is thought to have one of the world\u2019s highest plastic surgery rates, and the breast implant is the seminal procedure. Doctors performed 85,000 implants here last year, according to the International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery. Only the U.S., Brazil, Mexico and Germany \u2014 all with significantly larger populations \u2014 saw more procedures.\n\nThere are no official statistics on how many Venezuelans are walking around with enhanced busts. But a stroll down any Caracas street reveals that the augmentations are at least more conspicuous here than in other surgery-loving places. Even the mannequins look they\u2019ve gone under the knife.\n\nUntil recently, women could enter raffles for implants held by pharmacies, workplaces and even politicians on the campaign trail. During this spring\u2019s anti-government street demonstrations, the occasional sign protesting the rising price of breast implants mixed in with posters railing against food shortages and currency devaluation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a culture of \u2018I want to be more beautiful than you.\u2019 That\u2019s why even people who live in the slums get implants,\u201d surgeon Daniel Slobodianik said, fiddling with an FDA-approved pouch of saline solution no longer on sale here.\n\nSlobodianik used to perform several breast implants each week, but now performs closer to two a month. He says women call his office every day asking if he the implant size they\u2019re looking for. When they can\u2019t find it, they choose a second-best option, almost always a size up.\n\nNo one is giving the frustrated women much sympathy, especially not the government. The consumerism of plastic surgery has always jibed awkwardly with the rhetoric of socialist revolution. The late President Hugo Chavez called the country\u2019s plastic surgery fixation \u201cmonstrous,\u201d and railed against the practice of giving implants to girls on their 15th birthdays.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Venezuela\u2019s newest shortage: breast implants", "title": "Venezuela\u2019s newest shortage: breast implants", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Venezuela\u2019s newest shortage: breast implants", "title": "Venezuela\u2019s newest shortage: breast implants", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/09/15/venezuelas_newest_shortage_breast_implants/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/venezuela-implant-shortage.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Venezuela\u2019s newest shortage: breast implants", "title": "Venezuela\u2019s newest shortage: breast implants", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/venezuela-implant-shortage.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Hannah Dreier", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc242\"", "article_summary": "Slobodianik used to perform several breast implants each week, but now performs closer to two a month.\nDuring this spring\u2019s anti-government street demonstrations, the occasional sign protesting the rising price of breast implants mixed in with posters railing against food shortages and currency devaluation.\nThe consumerism of plastic surgery has always jibed awkwardly with the rhetoric of socialist revolution.\nDoctors performed 85,000 implants here last year, according to the International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery.\nThe late President Hugo Chavez called the country\u2019s plastic surgery fixation \u201cmonstrous,\u201d and railed against the practice of giving implants to girls on their 15th birthdays."}
