A snowstorm that entered Colorado from the Four Corners area dropped about an inch of new snow but didn't significantly drop temperatures.

"It's not going to be too much," said Frank Cooper, meteorologist for the National Weather Service in Boulder.

Xcel Energy reported seven separate power outages in the Glendale area affecting more than 6,000 costumers Thursday afternoon. It's unclear whether the outages are weather related.

Cooper said snow flurries started falling around 2 p.m. Thursday in Centennial. Up to 2 inches of snow was expected in the mountains.

But because the storm entered the state from the south, it won't drop temperatures below zero like the previous storm, Cooper said.

The low overnight in Cañon City was about 2 degrees as the skies cleared. The highs Thursday were expected to rise to the middle to upper 30s.

Snowfall is expected to return Saturday to Fremont County. About an inch or two will fall in the afternoon, with highs in the 40s.

Temperatures gradually will increase early next week with temperatures expected to break the freezing level by Monday, and by Wednesday, Fremont County could see a high of 55 degrees.

"We're trying to recover. It's just a slow recovery," Cooper said.
