But listen: For all the laughing you\u2019re about to do at Debbie\u2019s expense, give her a smidgen of credit for remaining a loud-and-proud ObamaCare booster even as dozens of gutless schmucks in her caucus run screaming from the fire they set in 2010. Maybe she doesn\u2019t have a choice \u2014 part of being DNC chair means smiling when you chow down on whatever new sh*t sandwich Obama\u2019s just made for you \u2014 but it\u2019s a nice change of pace from the \u201cI\u2019m shocked to find gambling going on in here\u201d attitude from other Democrats. Her reward for being a loyal soldier will be a brand new set of talking points soon, likely emphasizing that insurance companies are \u201cextremists\u201d and maybe borderline terrorists for failing to bring back all those canceled plans that ObamaCare all but forced them to cancel.\n\nI told you before that I feel no schadenfreude towards people who\u2019ve had their plans canceled, even if they helped elect this loser in the first place. But that doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t gather a big pile of schadenfreude at the political predicament now facing congressional Democrats and make snow angels in it. Jonah Goldberg\u2019s handing you the chalice. Drink deep:\n\nBut as a political and ideological matter, this is beyond fantastic. For years we\u2019ve been told that Democrats were more \u201creality-based,\u201d that \u201cfacts have a liberal bias,\u201d in the words of Paul Krugman, and that if they could just have their way, they could fix all of our problems. No one represented this arrogant promise more than Barack Obama himself. But, with an irony so rich it would be made of Corinthian leather if it was a car seat, the only way he could get his signature legislation passed was to baldly and brazenly lie about it, over and over and over again. He created a rhetorical cloud castle where no one would lose his insurance, every family would save thousands of dollars, and millions of the uninsured would suddenly get coverage. Anyone who doubted this was called a fool or a liar, or even a racist. It was, in the parlance of liberalism, a \u201cfalse choice\u201d to assert that Obamacare couldn\u2019t be a floor wax and a dessert topping. And all of this \u2014 every bit of it \u2014 is their own fault. The bedraggled cadres of Obama\u2019s defenders are valiantly trying to blame it all on Republican sabotage: The Obama administration had to keep the whole thing secret for fear of \u201cfeeding the opposition,\u201d in the words of a Washington Post reconstruction of the debacle. But when you read the stories, if you replace phrases like \u201ckeep the Republicans from finding out\u201d with the more accurate \u201ckeep the public from finding out,\u201d you\u2019ll get a better sense of things. The Obama White House, by which I mean the Obama campaign, was desperate to keep voters from grasping the scope of its misinformation campaign until after the election. And then, after the election, it was afraid to let the public know what they\u2019d been misinformed about\u2026 If Obamacare had been a shining success from Day One, do you think the Democrats would be in the mood to share the credit? Then why should Republicans be in more of a mood to share the blame?\n\nThe best part of the clip, needless to say, is DWS clinging for dear life to Terry McAuliffe\u2019s win in Virginia even though Cuccinelli (a) was badly outspent, (b) politically damaged by the shutdown, (c) ran a weak campaign by all accounts, (d) had a terrible de facto running mate in the GOP\u2019s choice for lieutenant governor, (e) was expertly demagogued by Dems with \u201cwar on women\u201d nonsense, and (e) nearly won the election anyway thanks to the ObamaCare Chernobyl. Good luck in the midterms, Debbie.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Gauntlet thrown.", "title": "Debbie Wasserman-Schultz: I meant what I said \u2014 we\u2019re running on ObamaCare next year", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2013/11/14/debbie-wasserman-schultz-i-meant-what-i-said-were-running-on-obamacare-next-year/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "keywords": "2014, insurance, insurers, midterms, ObamaCare, plans, wasserman-schultz,", "article": {"published_time": "2013-11-14T17:41:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-14T17:31:14+00:00"}, "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd5a0\"", "article_summary": "The Obama White House, by which I mean the Obama campaign, was desperate to keep voters from grasping the scope of its misinformation campaign until after the election.\nIt was, in the parlance of liberalism, a \u201cfalse choice\u201d to assert that Obamacare couldn\u2019t be a floor wax and a dessert topping.\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t gather a big pile of schadenfreude at the political predicament now facing congressional Democrats and make snow angels in it.\nI told you before that I feel no schadenfreude towards people who\u2019ve had their plans canceled, even if they helped elect this loser in the first place.\nThen why should Republicans be in more of a mood to share the blame?"}
