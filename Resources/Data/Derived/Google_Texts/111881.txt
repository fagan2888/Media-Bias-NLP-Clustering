Ben Carson, retired neurosurgeon and maker of bizarre comparisons between being gay and other things that are not at all like being gay, is still considered by some to be the next great savior of the Republican Party. In fact, a recent poll had him coming in just behind Rand Paul as the Republican second most likely to lose to Hillary Clinton in a hypothetical 2016 run. (The poll had Clinton beating Carson 45 percent to 38 percent, whereas Clinton would beat Paul by 46 percent to 39 percent.)

Carson is currently making the media rounds to promote his new book — and fan the flames of his GOP semi-stardom and speculation about 2016. In conversation with Newsmax TV host Ed Berline on Monday, Carson unveiled the kind of stellar thinking and capacity for bridge-building that has so many Republicans excited about his potential run. When asked if he could come up with a compromise on marriage equality — one of the “biggest, most contentious” issues of our day — he said that we all have to be willing to “understand that not everybody thinks the same way that they think” and “engage in conversation.”

Carson continued, “I don’t think I can impose my will on any two consenting adults. They can do what they want to do, I am not going to try to stop them from doing that.”
