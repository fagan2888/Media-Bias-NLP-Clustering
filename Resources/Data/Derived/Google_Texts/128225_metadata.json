You know, right before they shut down the government after promising they would not shutdown the government.\n\nRepublicans weren\u2019t going to shut down the government last year because it would hurt people:\n\nRep. Mark Meadows: \u201dLeadership has a concern, as do I\u2014they don\u2019t want side effects that would hurt people, and a government shutdown could do that.\u201d [Weekly Standard, 9/02/13]\n\nBut then they did shutdown the government, knowingly hurting people.\n\nCurrently, Senator Mitch McConnell (R-KY) is making shutdown promises if Republicans win the Senate, in what seems like a rather try-hard effort to attract the crazies. McConnell is promising to force the President to do the Koch\u2019s agenda, but even if Republicans win the Senate, McConnell can\u2019t force the President to do anything. The Republican Senator has even threatened to withhold government funding over the President\u2019s new EPA rules. Apparently nothing gets a Republican down like cutting down on toxins.\n\nRep. Steven King (R-IA) is making public threats to shutdown the government again, because the Tea Party is absolutely addicted to anarchistic chaos. Even an election year can\u2019t stop the crazy. This is King\u2019s \u201csolution\u201d to President Obama using his authority as President to issue an executive order on immigration, an act Obama is only considering taking because House Republicans are so inept that they haven\u2019t managed to actually address the immigration issue in a realistic way that the Senate would consider.\n\nKing thinks that the President signing the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) is cause for his impeachment, which just goes to show you that King doesn\u2019t know much about government. But you probably already sorted that one out.\n\nThis is not a winning strategy for the GOP. Republicans\u2019 \u201ctattered\u201d public image, in part from last year\u2019s shutdown, might cost them House seats. Republicans should have been able to gain 25 seats; they aimed for 11, but it looks like they might only pick up 5. They can\u2019t raise any real cash (even from their own members) and the big money left them for the big power in the Senate.\n\nDemocrats have a whole list of broken Republican promises from last year that sound a whole heck of a lot like the promises being made this year:\n\nRep. Glenn Thompson: \u201dU.S. Rep. Glenn Thompson, a former health-care executive, has made it clear that he is no fan of the Affordable Care Act. But Thompson does not think that shutting down the government, or denying funding for the law to halt its implementation, is the way to go.\u201d [Erie Times-News, 9/01/13] Rep. Steve Womack: \u201cRep. Steve Womack, who represents Republican-heavy northwest Arkansas, has also warned colleagues of the political fallout they\u2019d likely suffer over a standoff that he says would certainly trigger a government shutdown. Womack, who was elected in 2010, noted the backlash the GOP faced over partial shutdowns in 1995 and 1996. \u2018To me, the risks are not worth the gamble, the gamble being that we somehow cause the Senate to have this epiphany and the president to have this epiphany,\u2019 Womack said.\u201d [Associated Press, 9/01/13] Rep. Larry Bucshon: \u201dAm I in favor of a government shutdown? Absolutely not.\u201d [Tribune Star, 9/01/13 Rep. Rodney Davis: \u201cAt a Springfield appearance last week, Davis said a shutdown would go against his reason for seeking office. \u2018I came to Congress to govern,\u2019 he said.\u201d [State Journal-Register, 8/29/13] Rep. Steve Scalise: \u201dScalise says he doesn\u2019t want to see government shut down.\u201d [The Advocate, 8/28/13] Rep. Tom Latham: \u201dI am certainly not for any kind of government shutdown for any reason.\u201d [Des Moines Register, 8/28/13] Rep. Martha Roby: \u201dShe said she supports the defunding of the Affordable Care Act, but doesn\u2019t believe Republicans should shut down the government in their attempt to repeal the law. \u2018I am not for it (shutdown).'\u201d [Dothan Eagle, 8/27/13]\n\nBank on that! Republicans were against a government shutdown last year. No way that was going to happen. After all, they came to Congress to \u201cgovern\u201d.\n\nBut then that didn\u2019t happen. Actually, Republicans presided over the Do-Nothingest House on record, which is sort of like governing only without any of the responsibilities.\n\nRepublicans are headed for another disaster if they shutdown the government. They know a government shutdown is not responsible, would harm people and would harm their party, but they\u2019re high on hate. So high, that they just might be setting themselves up for the ultimate self-sabotage in 2016.\n\nWhat does it mean when Republicans make promises? Nothing. Where are the jobs?
