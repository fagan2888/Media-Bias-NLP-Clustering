Asa Hutchinson said Thursday.\n\nHutchinson also said that continuing the private option in its present form after next year is \u201coff the table.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, Hutchinson signed into law a bill containing his proposal for the private option to end after Dec. 31, 2016, and for a legislative task force to recommend an alternative model that could replace the program. The task force \u2014 which also will consider possible reforms for the entire Medicaid program \u2014 is required to make its recommendations in a report due by Dec. 31, 2015.\n\nIn a meeting with reporters in his office Thursday, Hutchinson said the Legislature will \u201chave to come back for a special session, I presume, when they get that final report.\u201d\n\nThe governor said he has not made a final decision on whether to call a special session on health care, but he said the 2016 fiscal session may not be a good fit.\n\nDuring a fiscal session, the Legislature can consider a non-budget bill only if two-thirds of the members of the House and Senate vote to do so. The Legislature will not meet again for a regular session until January 2017.\n\n\u201cThe fiscal issues are important. We want to devote attention to those,\u201d Hutchinson said. \u201cAnd I think the public expects a special session that would be devoted to this issue, because it\u2019s a very large challenge for us. We\u2019ve got to build a consensus for it. So I would suspect that that would be more suitable to a special session versus the fiscal session.\u201d\n\nThe private option \u2014 Arkansas\u2019 alternative to the Affordable Care Act\u2019s proposal to help states expand their Medicaid rolls \u2014 uses federal Medicaid money to subsidize private health insurance for people earning up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level. More than 205,000 Arkansans have enrolled in the program, according to the state Department of Human Services.\n\nThe federal government is paying all of the program\u2019s costs through 2016, but in 2017, the state would begin paying a share of the cost that would increase gradually to 10 percent.\n\nHutchinson was asked whether he would support something that is not called the private option but is essentially the same.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s off the table,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s probably the only thing that\u2019s off the table. Just in terms of integrity and honesty, I don\u2019t think anybody who expects this is the end of the private option wants it to be tweaked in minor ways and relabeled. That\u2019s not going to fly with the Arkansas voters, and that\u2019s not my expectation.\n\n\u201cI think this is going to be a total refiguring of it in an Arkansas way, with compassion but with fiscal prudence, and then also one that\u2019s innovative,\u201d he said. \u201cThe private option itself was an innovative solution, and I have a lot of confidence that we\u2019re going to, with the legislative task force, come up with a good solution for the future.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "LITTLE ROCK \u2014 A special session likely will be needed to take up the issue of what should replace the Medicaid expansion program known as the private option, Gov.
