LITTLE ROCK — Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign opened an office in downtown Little Rock on Monday, a week before early voting begins for Arkansas’ March 1 primary election.

Clinton was not present for a celebration of the office’s opening, held on the eve of the New Hampshire primaries. People who wanted photos with her were not entirely out of luck, however: a life-sized cardboard cutout of the former Arkansas and U.S. first lady and secretary of state was on hand.

Mary Rutherford Jennings, Clinton’s Arkansas press secretary, declined to say how many paid staff people the campaign has in Arkansas but said that “we’ve got hundreds and hundreds of volunteers” across the state. The campaign will announce the members of its Arkansas committee later this week, she said.

The campaign opened the office a week after Iowa’s Democratic caucus, which saw Clinton defeat Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders by less that one percentage point. Recent polling has shown Sanders leading in New Hampshire, a neighbor to his home state.

Clinton appeared at a Democratic Party fundraiser in North Little Rock in July and at a rally at Philander Smith College in Little Rock in September. Jennings said she did not have any information on upcoming appearances in the state.

Elected officials who attended the office’s opening included state Rep. Fred Love, D-Little Rock, who said he favors Clinton over Sanders because of her experience and her support for preserving the Affordable Care Act. Sanders favors a single-payer, universal health-care system he calls “Medicaid for all.”

“Let’s build on what we have, the model that President Obama has for health care,” Love said.
