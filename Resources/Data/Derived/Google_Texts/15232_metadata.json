It\u2019s tough to think about a history of public health or what will be its future without thinking about the impact vaccines have had in eradicating small pox, measles and polio. And yet a campaign of misinformation has dealt these achievements a significant setback. It\u2019s a great example of a situation that would seem highly unlikely and tough to predict.

They\u2019re designed to help public health officials plan for some of these scenarios and recommend what agencies need to do to control communicable diseases, ensure food safety, promote health, and foster emergency preparedness and response, according to the report.\n\nIn the most optimistic scenario, public health agencies have the resources to widely adopt big data analytics tools to improve population health. They create community-enhancing networks with partner organizations and local health improvement initiatives thrive. The networks make it possible for communities to exchange innovations and best practices. Racial inequality is a distant memory and economic disparity is no longer an issue.\n\nFor better and for worse, technological advancements have meant that companies can operate with fewer people, leading to mass unemployment. But in this scenario, it\u2019s OK because new community economic models help households sustain themselves. Hopefully, taxes and credit card debt won\u2019t be a problem anymore either. I get it \u2014 it\u2019s just one scenario. The problem is, it sounds more like one for a much smaller, homogeneous society in Northern Europe rather than the U.S. It seems like for these scenarios to be the most effective there should be more realism.\n\nHere\u2019s a summary of the worst case scenario:\n\n\u201cFunding cuts and a hostile political context undermine the role of public health agencies. Public health crises grow worse and more frequent, largely due to climate change. Private sector initiatives produce significant innovations for health and wellness, but these primarily benefit the middle class and affluent.

Make public health agencies into health development agencies that would wield more influence with people and resources to improve population health and eliminate health disparities.\n\n2. Shift from a culture of reacting to and treating people who get sick to a focus on preventing illness and promoting well being.\n\n3. Initiate conversations about inclusion, opportunity and equity.\n\n4. Work with other sectors outside of healthcare to support innovation to benefit from insights gathered from other industries.\n\nLike most visions of the future, there is a certain amount of each of these recommendations that are already being implemented, particularly number four.
