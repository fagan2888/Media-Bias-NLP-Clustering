WASHINGTON (AP) — President Barack Obama says U.S. service members make it possible to enjoy the “greatest blessings” in the greatest country on earth.

He says “freedom is not free” but is paid for by all the men and women of the military, including those who blanketed the White House South Lawn for a concert in their honor by Bruno Mars.

Obama spoke minutes before the annual Fourth of July fireworks lit up the night sky over the National Mall. He was accompanied by Michelle Obama.

Heavy rain that soaked Washington all day forced the White House to cancel its annual Fourth of July picnic for members of the military and their families.

The USO military service organization sponsored the concert that featured a performance by Mars.
