Three candidates remain in the race for Utica mayor- and Tuesday they were given the first formal chance to show why they are best suited for the job.

Compared to this month earlier Q&A - the race is heating up and so are the topics. Dozens gathered to watch incumbent mayor Robert Palmieri, former mayor Lou LaPolla and former city corporation council Linda Sullivan Fatata go head to head in a debate hosted by the league of women -giving each a chance to share their views on several serious issues around the city.

Topics included everything from taxes, what is to be done with Hotel Utica- and the nights hot topic the decision of location for the downtown hospital.

" I wanna open it up i want think outside the box- i want to make it like its never been before just completely revitalize and revive it and there are some great ideas on how to do it and I'm ready to put it in action. " Fatata said.

" This is an opportunity to know what I'm doing and what I propose and what I would do differently. Its certainly not to any ones advantage to just criticize- if you criticize you have to offer a solution and that is exactly what I want to do." Lapolla said.

"There is a feeling in the air that I feel we haven't had in a long time here in the city of Utica and I'd like to have an opportunity to fulfill it in the next four years because we are just starting we are not ending uh we are going to keep on going and the best is yet to come. " Palmieri said.
