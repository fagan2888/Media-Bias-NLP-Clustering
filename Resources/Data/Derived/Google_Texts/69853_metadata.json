U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry first got the candidates to agree to the idea of a power-sharing structure during a July visit to Afghanistan with many follow-up phone calls and visits since then.\n\n\"This agreement marks an important opportunity for unity and increased stability in Afghanistan. We continue to call on all Afghans \u2014 including political, religious, and civil society leaders \u2014 to support this agreement and to come together in calling for cooperation and calm,\" the White House said in a statement.", "article_metadata": {"description": "After months of negotiations, Afghanistan finally names its president.
